5.4 Defences

So far, [we have introduced the concept of **cyber
espionage**]{.underline} as well as commonly encountered threats to
information security. [We continue with]{.underline} fundamental
[techniques to defend]{.underline} information [systems against these
threats]{.underline}.

5.4.1 Security Controls

In general, there are [two distinct approaches to secure]{.underline}
information [systems]{.underline}. Ideally, we would be able to ensure
that attacks do not happen in the first place. Therefore, most efforts
have focused on proactive techniques (sometimes also called preventive
techniques). Recently, interest in reactive techniques has increased.
Proponents of reactive security embrace the fact that it is challenging
to achieve perfect security. Consequently, they argue that organisations
should accept that they will eventually become a victim, which is why
they should prepare for this situation in advance.

Pfleeger et al. (2015, Sect. 1.5) have identified six distinct types of
security controls. We will briefly review them here and provide
examples.

The first three types are proactive controls.

[Controls in the **prevention category**]{.underline} effectively
[ensure that an attack]{.underline} against a target [is not
successful]{.underline}, e. g., [by blocking the adversary from reaching
a vulnerable system or]{.underline} by [**closing** the
**vulnerability**]{.underline} that the [adversary tries to
exploit]{.underline}. Examples of preventive techniques are firewalls,
access control mechanisms, and cryptographic protection of sensitive
contents. If deployed correctly, these [techniques are very
**effective** against]{.underline} particular [attacks]{.underline}.

Deterrence, on the other hand, does not make an attack utterly
impossible. Deterrence can be achieved by increasing the amount of
effort for an adversary. As a result, the adversary is expected to
refrain from attempting the attack. Many security controls belong to
this category.

Alternatively, deterrence may be achieved with laws that punish
malicious activities. However, laws are often ineffective to deter cyber
espionage, because there is no credible threat of being caught. Firstly,
attribution of an attack to a particular perpetrator is difficult,
because attackers can use techniques to obfuscate their true location.
Secondly, even if an attacker is identified, due to the global nature of
the internet, a successful prosecution requires the collaboration of law
enforcement agencies in multiple nation states, which often does not
work efficiently yet.

A well-known example of a deterrence control is the deployment of
two-factor authentication. Besides providing a username and a password
for authentication, users have to prove their identity via another
means, for instance a biometric feature such as a fingerprint or by
demonstrating that they have access to their smartphone. Of course,
determined adversaries may still succeed to get access to the second
authentication factor -- therefore, it is not a preventive measure.
However, now the attack is much more involving. Thus, the deployment of
two-factor authentication can be expected to deter many attackers from
trying to attack an authentication procedure at all.

The difference between prevention and deterrence is more evident in the
following example. It is considered good practice to not store passwords
as cleartext. Instead, each password is fed into a one-way function and
only the result of this function is stored. One-way functions like
Argon2 (Biryukov et al., 2017) are constructed in such a way that there
is no known way to invert them efficiently (yet). This does not prevent
an attacker from trying to guess the password given the stored value by
conducting a so-called brute-force attack: In a brute-force attack, an
attacker enumerates all possible passwords, applies the one-way function
to each of them, and checks whether the result matches the hash value in
question. Even though the attacker will be successful eventually, the
required effort is so high (if the password is sufficiently strong) that
many attackers will not bother with a brute-force attack.

Another approach is deflection. Here the goal of the defender is to make
a system less attractive as a target; or another system a more
attractive one. Deflection can be achieved, for instance, by deploying
honeypot systems within an organisation (Spitzner, 2002). Adversaries
cannot distinguish honeypots from production systems. Security measures
on the honeypots are intentionally weak, and they are configured to look
like lucrative targets hosting valuable pieces of information.

The next three types are reactive controls.

There are [two kinds of controls for detection]{.underline}.
[On]{.underline} the [one hand]{.underline}, there [are **real-time
monitoring systems**]{.underline}, on the other hand, there are
**[logging solutions]{.underline}**. An example of a real-time system is
an Intrusion Detection System like Snort (https://www.snort.org). These
systems can be configured to alert operators about an attack in real
time, which may help defenders to thwart an ongoing attack. However, for
a real-time system to be an effective control, defenders have to deploy
personnel that is on call at all times.

In contrast, logging solutions collect evidence that may support
analysis of an incident in retrospect. The logs may contain information
that has been collected by network monitors (packet sniffers) as well as
information gathered on clients and servers, e. g., user interactions,
executed programs, modified files, etc. After an attack, security
analysts can scrutinise these logs to track down the origin of an attack
("attribution", see Chapter 13 "Attribution of Cyber Attacks") and its
extent, i.e. what files and systems have been compromised.

It is common to integrate multiple detection systems into a Security and
Incident Event Management (SIEM) solution that supports organisations to
handle incidents in a systematic way (Bhatt et al., 2014).

Assuming that some attacks will succeed, organisations may also deploy
mitigation controls. They aim to reduce the likelihood of a successful
attack or its impact. An example in the context of the protection goal
availability is to host redundant copies of a database in multiple
locations.

Some prevention controls can also be viewed as mitigation controls. For
example, access control mechanisms ensure that users can only access the
files that they actually need for their work. This prevents an adversary
who has compromised the workstation of an employee in the human
resources department from stealing blueprints that can only be accessed
by members of the research department.

Finally, some controls focus on recovery. Techniques from this category
help organisations to revert the effects of an attack, to regain control
of their systems, and to return to normal operation. Widely deployed
techniques are (offsite) backups that allow restoring lost data as well
as emergency playbooks that provide guidance during a crisis.

In practice, [organisations deploy **multiple** complementary controls
at the **same time**]{.underline}. A [common strategy is to **prevent**
**as many intrusions as possible**]{.underline}, [to implement
**detection** systems in order to be notified about]{.underline} ongoing
[attacks]{.underline}, and to prepare incident-response plans.

5.4.2 Security Design Principles

Securing complex systems is challenging because system builders have to
create [trustworthy systems]{.underline} from untrustworthy components
(Schneider, 1998). Saltzer and Schroeder (1975) were the first to come
up with a set of principles for the development of secure software. Over
time their [principles have been]{.underline} refined and updated
(Smith, 2012):

■ Continuous improvement. Security is not a state, but a process.
Therefore, system operators have to continuously assess whether they
have to make changes to a system to keep it secure.

■ **[Least privilege]{.underline}**. Users and [entities]{.underline}
should only [have]{.underline} the [minimum amount of access
rights]{.underline} that allow them to fulfil their duties.

■ Defence in depth. [Systems]{.underline} should [not rely on a **single
security mechanism**]{.underline} but [have **multiple
mechanisms**]{.underline}. The mechanisms should be [arranged in
layers]{.underline} around the system [so that an adversary has to
disable all of them to succeed]{.underline}.

■ Open design. A [security mechanism]{.underline} should [not rely on
the fact that its design is a secret]{.underline} ("security through
obscurity"). This is related to Kerckhoffs' principle: In cryptography,
the adversary may know the algorithm; the [security solely rests on the
secrecy of the **cryptographic key**]{.underline} (Kerckhoffs, 1883).

■ **[Chain of control]{.underline}**. This can, firstly, mean to ensure
that only trustworthy software is being executed by the operating
system. To this end, state-of-the art operating systems offer so-called
whitelisting techniques. Secondly, [one can allow arbitrary software to
be executed but restrict]{.underline} the [control flow within every
program]{.underline} to enforce desired security properties. An example
for this approach is the use of techniques like Data Execution
Prevention (DEP) and Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR). DEP and
ASLR mitigate the risk of buffer overflow attacks, where an attacker
supplies crafted inputs to an application that mislead the CPU to break
out of the intended control flow, executing malicious code supplied by
the attacker instead.

■ Deny by default. Unless explicitly specified no access should be
granted to any entity.

■ Transitive trust. If system A trusts system B and system B trusts
system C, then A can also trust C.

■ Trust but verify. Even if a system is considered trustworthy, its
identity must be verified before interacting with it.

■ Separation of duty. [Split up critical tasks into **smaller problems**
that are carried out by **separate components**]{.underline} or
individuals.

■ The principle of least astonishment. Good usability of security
mechanisms is an essential requirement for them to be effective.
Mechanisms should be comprehensible, and their consequences should be
intuitive.

David **1AC** **Fidler 18**, the James Louis Calamaras Emeritus
Professor of Law at Indiana University, Adjunct Senior Fellow for
Cybersecurity and Global Health at the Council on Foreign Relations,
4/3/18, "Cybersecurity and the New Era of Space Activities,"
https://www.cfr.org/report/cybersecurity-and-new-era-space-activities

[The tasks of securing outer space and cyberspace are
converging.]{.underline} The internet increasingly depends on
space-enabled communication and information services. Likewise, [the
operation of satellites and other space assets relies on internet-based
networks]{.underline}, which makes these assets, like cars and medical
equipment, devices on the internet of things. New government actors,
companies, goals, and technologies are expanding and transforming space
activities. However, [neither space policy nor cybersecurity policy is
prepared for the challenges created by the meshing of space and
cyberspace]{.underline}, **[which could increase national security
risks]{.underline}**.

[To meet these challenges, government, industry, and **international
action is needed**]{.underline}. The Donald J. Trump administration's
National Space Council should develop cybersecurity recommendations for
space activities, and federal agencies should prioritize these within
the government and in cooperation with the private sector. In crafting
needed legislation for commercial space activities, Congress should
bolster industry efforts to strengthen cybersecurity. Private-sector
actors should strengthen their adoption of cybersecurity best practices
and collaborate with one another on improving implementation of
cybersecurity strategies. Internationally, [**the United States** should
pursue **collaboration on space cybersecurity** through the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization **(NATO),**]{.underline} [plurilateral
space cooperation mechanisms]{.underline}, and bilateral forums.

Outer space has been a national security priority for spacefaring
nations [since the 1950s. Governments started space
programs]{.underline} for intelligence, military, political, and
scientific purposes [and developed countermeasures against space-based
threats from rivals, such as anti-satellite capabilities]{.underline}.
[Countries managed security competition by banning weapons]{.underline}
of mass destruction in [space and cooperating on peaceful uses of
space]{.underline}. [Government programs catalyzed]{.underline}
private-sector adaptation of [dual-use technologies to provide satellite
communication services]{.underline}.

**[Despite the importance of satellites]{.underline}**, the U.S. General
Accounting Office concluded \[PDF\] in 2002 that [efforts on **critical
infrastructure** protection **did not include the satellite
industry**]{.underline}, but should do so. Similarly, [cybersecurity has
not been a priority in government]{.underline} and private-sector space
endeavors. One leading analysis \[PDF\] asserted that [cybersecurity
discussions often overlook space activities' vulnerability to
cyberattack]{.underline}. For example, neither the UN governmental group
of experts (GGE) on outer space nor the UN GGE on cyberspace addressed
the convergence of their respective agendas.

[Governments, critical infrastructure, and economies rely on
space-dependent services]{.underline}---for example, the Global
Positioning System (GPS)---[that are vulnerable to hostile cyber
operations]{.underline}. [[Geopolitical competition]{.mark}
[fuels]{.mark} the [militarization of space]{.mark}, [which]{.mark}
[heightens]{.mark} [state]{.mark} incentive[s to devise cyber
espionage]{.mark}, interference, [and attack]{.mark} strategies against
rivals' [space operations]{.mark}]{.underline}. The United States
suspects that China has engaged in cyber operations against U.S.
satellites. Chinese military writings emphasize \[PDF\] the need to
target satellites to "blind and deafen the enemy." The then commander of
Air Force Space Command, General John E. Hyten, told Congress in 2016
that "[adversaries are developing . . . cyber tools to deny, degrade,
and destroy]{.underline}" \[PDF\] [U.S. space capabilities that support
war fighting, critical infrastructure, and economic
activity.]{.underline} Other countries likely believe the United States
is preparing to conduct cyber espionage, disruption, and attack
operations against the space assets of rival states.

The commercialization of space heightens cybersecurity concerns for many
reasons, including market incentives to lower costs and innovate
quickly, often at the expense of software and hardware security.
Entrepreneurial activities---dubbed the New Space sector---are underway
in space transport, space tourism, asteroid mining, lunar operations,
and missions to Mars. [A small-satellite ("smallsat")
revolution]{.underline} involving spacecraft far smaller than
traditional satellites [is unfolding.]{.underline} Networks of linked
smallsats can provide internet access, communications, data storage and
transmission, imaging, and remote sensing. [This next generation of
satellites harnesses innovations in]{.underline} computing, electronics,
miniaturization, imaging, sensors, [big data, and artificial
intelligence]{.underline}. [**[Satellite services]{.mark}**]{.underline}
for Earth observations from space **[are growing]{.underline}**. They
support many policy and commercial purposes [and contribute to
**agricultural productivity**, transportation efficiency, and
**environmental monitoring**]{.underline}. Commercial space activities
use cutting-edge technologies and produce valuable data [and are, thus,
[targets for cyber espionage]{.mark}, [including economic]{.mark} [cyber
espionage]{.mark}, and cybercrime.]{.underline}

Challenges

Space agencies, the satellite industry, cybersecurity researchers,
nongovernmental bodies, and intergovernmental satellite organizations
show increasing awareness of the space cybersecurity challenge.
Nevertheless, experts are worried. NASA's then chief information
security officer, Jeanette Hanna-Ruiz, warned that ["it's a matter of
time before someone hacks into something in space]{.underline}." Chatham
House's David Livingstone asserted that "people are just shuffling . . .
paper around" and suggested that only "a disaster" might catalyze
serious action. Josh Hartman, a former senior Pentagon official and Air
Force officer, argued before the satellite industry's first
cybersecurity summit held in 2017 that, on cybersecurity, "[most of the
space community . . . has their heads in the sand]{.underline}." **[The
"attack surface"]{.underline}** of space activities **[is
expanding,]{.underline}** [but governments and industry are **not taking
adequate action**.]{.underline}

[Protecting space activities requires understanding]{.underline} the
particular [cyber vulnerabilities]{.underline} that arise in various
space operations. For example, satellite cybersecurity encompasses the
satellite itself, transmissions to and from Earth, and ground stations.
[U.S. military and intelligence satellite systems are vulnerable
to]{.underline} kinetic and [cyberattacks. Civilian smallsat
systems]{.underline} might also prove insecure, given the
[lack]{.underline} of [cybersecurity in their design]{.underline}, their
use of commercial off-the-shelf components, and the vulnerabilities
potentially created by connecting satellites to operate as complex,
orbiting networks.

[Neither international law nor diplomacy has grappled effectively with
space cybersecurity]{.underline}. Multiple bodies of international law
are relevant, but [controversies about whether and how international law
applies to cyberspace have adversely affected cyber
diplomacy]{.underline}. Such travails have elevated the prominence of
nongovernmental efforts to clarify international law's application in
cyberspace, such as the Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law
Applicable to Cyber Operations. However, [states continue to conduct
cyber operations that violate international law]{.underline}. For
example, the UN International Telecommunication Union prohibits
interference with satellite transmissions, yet such interference
frequently occurs.

The militarization of space potentially threatens the requirement in the
Outer Space Treaty (OST) that space activities comply with international
law to maintain international peace and security and promote
international cooperation. [The United States has declared that **space
is now a "war-fighting domain**,]{.underline}" [and China's and Russia's
military ambitions in space are growing]{.underline}. The UN Committee
on Disarmament's work on a treaty to prevent an arms race in space
failed. As happened with cyberspace, these difficulties in space
diplomacy [have increased nongovernmental interest in clarifying how
international law applies to military operations in space]{.underline}.

The commercialization of space fuels concerns that the private sector
will unduly influence how states interpret the OST's duty to authorize
and supervise nongovernmental space activities. The debate over whether
U.S. support for commercial space activities violates this OST
requirement might also create diplomatic problems.

New diplomatic initiatives on space cybersecurity would encounter
headwinds. Putting "space" before "cybersecurity" does not alleviate the
geopolitical tensions that already limit cooperation on cyberspace and
space. The United States, China, and Russia have not agreed on how to
approach cybersecurity or address military activities in space. Recent
diplomatic activities on space and cybersecurity concluded without
addressing space cybersecurity, including the UN GGEs on cyberspace and
outer space and the European Union's code of conduct for space
activities \[PDF\]. Negotiations in the UN Committee on Peaceful Uses of
Outer Space on guidelines for the long-term sustainability of space
activities considered but did not adopt proposed guidelines \[PDF\] on
information-security policies for the terrestrial and orbital parts of
space systems. Controversies and disagreements during these efforts
suggest that reopening them for space cybersecurity would not be
effective. Further, the increased number of spacefaring nations, which
now includes such countries as South Korea and the United Arab Emirates,
complicates diplomacy by requiring more countries to reach consensus.

States might also believe more diplomatic activity is not necessary
because they already have sufficient incentives to refrain from
dangerous cyber operations in space. Disabling a satellite through cyber
means could turn it into space debris---already a major problem---that
threatens space activities for all countries. The importance of
intelligence satellites in maintaining nuclear deterrence also
encourages restraint in interfering with the satellites of rival nuclear
powers. Following trends on Earth, countries might want to avoid
diplomatic activity in order to engage in cyber operations in space that
"subvert the integrity of political, social, and economic systems,
rather than destroy physical infrastructure" by, for example,
manipulating or hijacking an adversary's space infrastructure to spread
propaganda and misinformation.

Recommendations

Government

The United States can provide leadership on cybersecurity in outer space
through a comprehensive strategy. The Trump administration is positioned
to advance space cybersecurity because its priorities include improving
critical infrastructure cybersecurity, addressing security threats to
space operations \[PDF\], and promoting commercial space activities. The
administration resurrected the National Space Council and should task it
with developing recommendations on strengthening the cybersecurity of
space infrastructure. To do so, the council should convene government
officials and leaders from the commercial space sector to share insights
on managing cybersecurity as space and cyberspace merge. These leaders
should include people who have led both information technology and space
enterprises, such as Paul Allen (Stratolaunch Systems), Jeff Bezos (Blue
Origin), and Elon Musk (SpaceX). The Trump administration should
instruct the Department of Commerce, Department of Homeland Security,
Federal Aviation Administration, Federal Communications Commission, and
NASA to make cybersecurity a priority in their space collaborations with
the private sector.

With private-sector space activities expanding, Congress should adopt a
comprehensive regulatory framework for the commercial space sector.
Current law does not regulate the full range of space activities the
private sector is planning, a problem recognized \[PDF\] but not
addressed during the Barack Obama administration. A comprehensive
framework would provide commercial space enterprises with regulatory
certainty and help the United States comply with its OST obligation to
authorize and supervise nongovernmental space activities. The
legislation should emphasize the importance of existing federal law on
cybersecurity information sharing, provide government assistance to
industry-led efforts to strengthen space cybersecurity (especially
concerning threats from state actors), and---as happened in other
sectors, such as energy---facilitate public-private collaborations on
cybersecurity.

Industry

Improving space cybersecurity requires extending good cybersecurity
practices into the commercial space sector and addressing problems
specific to space activities. Advice for this sector repeats familiar
mantras, such as the need for intra-sector collaboration, information
sharing, enterprise risk management, encryption, insider threat
prevention, and supply chain protection. The federal government has, for
example, rightly stressed \[PDF\] the utility of the Cybersecurity
Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity \[PDF\]
for satellite companies.

Industry associations in space sectors should move from identifying
general principles and recommendations, such as those in the Joint
Statement on the Satellite Industry's Commitment to Cybersecurity, to
supporting implementation activities. The Satellite Industry Association
could, for example, include in its annual State of the Satellite
Industry Report \[PDF\] information on the industry's cybersecurity
activities, as is done in other industries.

International

The difficulty of reaching multilateral agreement on cybersecurity and
space issues means [the United States should address space cybersecurity
in plurilateral]{.underline} and bilateral [contexts]{.underline}.
**[The United States should raise space cybersecurity within
NATO]{.underline}**, [given the alliance's plans to upgrade its
satellite and cyber defense capabilities. U.S.]{.underline} bilateral
[cybersecurity cooperation with spacefaring countries]{.underline}, such
as India and Japan, [should include space cybersecurity]{.underline}.
With their history of collaboration, NASA and the European Space Agency,
which is increasingly aware of cybersecurity threats to its programs,
should sign a memorandum of understanding to cooperate on space
cybersecurity.

More ambitiously[, the United States should use effective mechanisms of
space diplomacy to improve space cybersecurity]{.underline}. For
example, the International Space Station (ISS) has involved the United
States, Canada, Japan, Russia, and the European Space Agency managing
the "the most politically complex space exploration program ever
undertaken." The United States should discuss the need for more
cooperation on space cybersecurity within the ISS framework. In
addition, the United States could lead establishment of an
intergovernmental coordination mechanism for developing guidance on
space cybersecurity. The mechanism could be modeled on the Inter-Agency
Space Debris Coordination Committee (IADC), composed of space agencies
from leading spacefaring countries. The IADC's nonbinding guidelines are
credited with reducing space debris produced by new launches.

Conclusion

[Actions at the]{.underline} national, industry, and [international
levels can harness growing awareness about space cybersecurity and
strengthen policy]{.underline} and industry practices [as the
convergence of space and cyberspace accelerates]{.underline}. Outer
space might not be the "final frontier for cybersecurity," but
**[achieving cybersecurity beyond Earth]{.underline}** [is one of the
many responsibilities the new era of space activities creates for
governments]{.underline} and societies.

[Western nations **vary widely** in their **approach** to the
**security** of **5G networks** and in the basic
assumptions]{.underline} that drive their policy. [This is]{.underline}
clearly [illustrated by]{.underline} the example of [**Huawei**
and]{.underline} other [foreign technology providers being excluded
from]{.underline} the development of 5G in [some Western
nations]{.underline}. While Sweden has excluded the two Chinese
contributors, Huawei and ZTE, from participating in the development of
5G in Sweden (with Huawei filing an appeal against this ban),11 Norway
has decided not to strictly ban the use of 5G equipment. Despite demands
from the Norwegian government in December 2019, Telenor's development of
the 5G network in Bergen, Norway, is mostly based on Huawei sources and
will remain so until 2024, when Telenor will remove untrusted sources
due to security considerations.12 Austria initially decided not to rule
out the use of Huawei technology in 5G networks but stated (under former
chancellor Sebastian Kurz) that it would coordinate its actions with the
EU.13 A more recent statement indicates that 5G may be built with
Chinese contributions in Austria, serving Telekom Austria's 25 million
customers across Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Belarus, Slovenia, Serbia,
and North Macedonia and using Chinese vendors in Bulgaria and North
Macedonia for 4G.14 Belgium initially found no evidence of possible
espionage through the utilization of Huawei's technology and hence
decided not to ban Huawei from contributions to the Belgian 5G network
development.15 However, it was reported that Belgian operators Orange
Belgium and Proximus dropped Huawei as a consequence of US pressure to
exclude Chinese vendors.16 It was later reported that Belgium had
previously experienced a pro-Huawei malign influence campaign.17 Britain
decided to remove Huawei's technology from its telecommunication
networks and demanded its vendors reduce Huawei's share of the network
infrastructure to 35% by 2023.18 [This process]{.underline}, which is
expected to take until 2027, [was **instigated** by the **U**nited
**S**tates, alleging]{.underline} that [Huawei posed a **security
threat** due to its **closeness** to the **Chinese**
government]{.underline}.19 Orange France decided to avoid using Chinese
vendors when developing European 5G networks but envisions Huawei
playing a role in the African 5G rollout.20 If there is a pattern among
Western approaches to 5G security, it appears to be a consensus within
the 'Five Eyes' partnership, and wide variance outside it.21

[Many]{.underline} of the [discussions around]{.underline} whether
[Huawei]{.underline} equipment (or software, as described above) should
be used in 5G networks [centred on the question of]{.underline} whether
[a '**backdoor**']{.underline} existed [in available **equipment**. The
crucial realization]{.underline}, however, [is that the **5G
architecture** does not need 'backdoors' to be built into the system.
The]{.underline} mere [ability to **contribute** to the **5G core**
network **constitutes a backdoor**. The 5G architecture demands
**continuous integration** and **continuous deployment** of **function**
and **software** updates]{.underline}. As [there is currently **no valid
option** to automatically **check code** iterations for]{.underline}
complex **[malicious execution]{.underline}** options, this either must
be monitored by IT professionals or will simply be based on trust in the
contributor. The huge number of code iterations and updates that will
propagate through a multitude of virtualizations makes it unlikely that
this monitoring can be done by humans.

In addition, [the **complexity** of the **architecture** and the
**distributed nature** of its development opens up a still **greater
risk** of **supply chain attacks**. In mid-2020]{.underline}, detection
of the [SolarWinds]{.underline} attack [demonstrated the critical
importance of software **supply chain transparency** and
**integrity**]{.underline} (as well as the power of CI/CD attacks, as
described above).22 [It is equally vital that]{.underline} the
[**construction** of 5G network architecture for **NATO**]{.underline}
member states [is **protected** from hostile state
interference]{.underline} -- but this begs the question of how to
exclude software providers owned by interests within those adversary
states if they are already integrated into the network provision
ecosystem.23

SECTION 3.

Strategic Goals of Adversaries In Networks of NATO Allies

[It is **essential** that any **new technology** that introduces
**critical dependencies** within NATO nations be **adequately secured**
against **threats** from both **non-state** and **state** actors. This
requires a **full** and **regularly updated assessment** of the aims and
approaches to conflict of]{.underline} a wide range of [possible
adversaries. It also requires full and **honest recognition** of the
threat among NATO allies]{.underline} themselves, [and an acceptance
that]{.underline} a state of [notional peacetime does not
mean]{.underline} that [hostilities are not being waged]{.underline} by
any available means.

[The **new vulnerabilities** introduced by the **specific nature** of 5G
networks lend themselves to a]{.underline} wide [range of **unfriendly**
and **overtly hostile actions** by adversaries. As with]{.underline}
other forms of [**information threat**, these span a broad spectrum of
ambition, from simply **causing damage** with no other specific
objective]{.underline} in mind, [to high-level **geostrategic change**
brought]{.underline} about [through indirect means]{.underline}.24
[Non-like-minded nations, including but not limited to **Russia** and
**China**, have closely studied means of **damaging** or **destroying**
the civilian **communications networks** of NATO]{.underline} member
[states, and it should be **anticipated** that this **probing** for
vulnerabilities will **intensify** as relations deteriorate]{.underline}
further. Russian president Vladimir [**Putin** has repeatedly
**promised** responses to Western actions that are unexpected and
'asymmetric']{.underline}.25 To prevent such responses, [NATO
governments should seek to **minimize** their self-inflicted
**vulnerabilities**]{.underline}.

[Nevertheless, unless **adequately** secured, **5G** networks **simplify
the task** of the attacker]{.underline} in achieving their aims.
Examples include:

Network destruction and information interdiction. [Adversaries can
achieve effects **remotely** that currently require **physical
intervention** against telecommunications]{.underline} infrastructure.26
This could be [either in support of a localized objective, or a

In addition, [the nature of 5G, as well as]{.underline} other [advanced

**Cyber blackmail** for political coercion is not]{.underline} a
[novel]{.underline} concept, [but it takes on **new

5G. For demonstrations of the blackmailer's capabilities, destruction of
critical national infrastructure remains a relatively unlikely option,
given the near-consensus that this constitutes an act of war. However,
if such an attack were carried out, isolation measures intended to
protect critical infrastructure would limit its reach. By contrast,
[more **subtle** interventions -- like increasing the latency of the

[could affect much wider areas and spread throughout broad

[attacking a **NFV** will hit not just that one **water supplier** but
**any network operator**]{.underline} using the NFV. And depending on
the NFV (or any other software component crucial to the backbone), [this
may **propagate rapidly** and **widely**, including **across borders**

[Cutting]{.underline} **[submarine cables]{.underline}**,
[a]{.underline}n old and **[proven]{.underline}** [practice of
war]{.underline}

Recent attacks on cables carrying voice and data traffic between North
America and Europe lead to the idea that they seem to be undergoing a
new development. France and the United Kingdom had already dealt with
this experience on the part of the Germans during the First World War.
These infrastructures were part of the global cable telegraph network.
Similarly, the United States cut wartime cables as a means of disrupting
the ability of an enemy power to command and control distant forces.

The first such attacks took place in 1898, during the Spanish-American
War. That year, in the Gulf of Manila (Philippines), the USS Zafiro cut
the cable connecting Manila to the Asian continent to isolate the
Philippines from the rest of the world, as well as the cable connecting
Manila to the Philippine city of Capiz. Other spectacular cable attacks
took place in the Caribbean, plunging Spain into the dark during the
conflict in Puerto Rico and Cuba, which contributed greatly to the final
victory of the United States.

Russia interested in NATO's subsea infrastructure

[Russia]{.underline} [seems to **materialize the concerns**]{.underline}
[at the highest level in this field.]{.underline} In 2015, the [presence
of Russian vessel]{.underline} Yantar along the US coast, **[near the
cables]{.underline}**, [did not fail to arouse tensions between the two
states. At the end of 2017]{.underline}, **[the situation
repeated.]{.underline}**

"[We are]{.underline} now [seeing Russian]{.underline} **[underwater
activity]{.underline}** [in the vicinity of undersea cables that I don't
believe **we have ever seen**]{.underline}. [Russia is clearly taking an
interest in NATO and NATO nations' undersea
infrastructure]{.underline}," said Admiral Andrew Lennon, commander of
the organization's submarine forces. [It's like going back **to the days
of the Cold War**]{.underline}... To the point where Policy Exchange has
devoted an entire chapter of its "Russia Risk" report to this topic. The
think tank recalls the episode of the annexation of Crimea in 2014, when
the peninsula was isolated from the rest of Ukraine by physically
cutting off communications.

"If the relative weakness of the Russian position makes a conventional
conflict with NATO unlikely, [fibre-optic cables **can** be a target for
Russia]{.underline}. We should prepare for an [increase in hybrid
actions in the maritime field, not only in Russia, but **also in China
and Iran**]{.underline}," underlines the former commander of the NATO
allied forces, the American Admiral James G. Stravridis.

Three major security risks

The first risk factor is the [growing]{.underline} **[volume of
data]{.underline}** [flowing through cables]{.underline}, [which
encourages third countries to **spy on or disrupt
traffic.**]{.underline}

The second risk factor is the [increasing **capital intensity of** these
facilities]{.underline}, [which leads to the creation of international
consortia involving up to dozens of owners]{.underline}. These owners
are separated from the entities that produce the cable components and
from those that position the cables along the ocean floor. [Timeshare
makes it possible to reduce costs substantially, but at the same time
allows the entry in these consortia of state actors who could use their
influence to disrupt data flows, or even to interrupt them in a conflict
scenario]{.underline}. At the other end of the spectrum, GAFAMs (Google,
Apple, Facebook, Amazon, and Microsoft) now have the financial and
technical capacity to build their own cables. Thus, the Dunant cable,
which links France to the United States, is entirely owned by Google.
[The Chinese giants have also embarked on a strategy of submarine
conquest: this is the case of the Peace cable, which connects China to
Marseilles, owned by the Hengtong company, considered by the Chinese
government as a model of "**civilian-military**".]{.underline}

[[Another threat is]{.underline} **[espionage]{.underline}**]{.mark},
[which [requires]{.mark} specially [equipped submarines]{.mark}, or
submarines [operating from ships]{.mark}, [capable of
intercepting]{.mark}, or even modifying, [data passing through]{.mark}
fibre-optic [cables]{.mark} without damaging them. So far, only **China,
Russia and the United States have such means.**]{.underline}

The most vulnerable point of submarine cables, however, is where they
reach land: the landing stations Thus, the town of Lège-Cap-Ferret,
where the interface room between the Franco-American cable "Amitié" will
be built, has recently become a veritable nest of spies, according to
informed sources.

In addition to legitimate commercial and social interaction,
[[China's]{.mark} **[biotech industry]{.mark}** may have also [benefited
from]{.mark} **illicit extraction** of **overseas technology** through
**[espionage]{.mark}**]{.underline} or the theft of trade secrets. Only
so much can be said about this topic without the release of classified
materials, so the scope and patterns of criminal activities benefitting
Chinese entities is impossible to describe accurately in a public
document. However, court documents and other public materials illustrate
that the biotech industry has been a target for such activity since at
least the 1990s (Table 2-4).

The [majority of]{.underline} these [[cases]{.mark} [involve]{.mark}
[Chinese]{.mark} [citizens]{.mark} who [targeted]{.mark}
**[gene]{.mark}tically [engineered]{.mark}** **[ag]{.mark}**ricultural
products]{.underline}, **[seeds]{.underline}**, [**[IP]{.mark}**-related
**[info]{.mark}**]{.underline}rmation, [[or]{.mark}
**[chem]{.mark}ical** [or]{.mark} **[bio]{.mark}logical
[products]{.mark}**]{.underline}. At least six theft attempts have
occurred within the medical industry. Theft and [[espionage]{.mark}
attempts have [targeted]{.mark} a wide range of **[treatments]{.mark}**
[and]{.mark} **[equipment]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [including robotic
surgical equipment]{.underline}, [cancer treatments]{.underline},
[treatments for organ recipients]{.underline}, [cornea
regeneration]{.underline}, [hepatitis C diagnostics]{.underline}, [and
an anemia drug]{.underline}. The agricultural industry has also been
targeted on multiple occasions. Two theft attempts involved stealing
genetically engineered rice or corn seeds, while other thefts have
targeted organic pesticides, engineered food products, and livestock
feed supplements.

The [majority of [theft attempts]{.mark} were]{.underline} directed
against a current or former employer (Table 2-4). Ventria Bioscience,
GlaxoSmithKline, Dow AgroSciences LLC, Cargill Inc, Roche Diagnostics,
and Amgen have all experienced theft of trade secrets or biological
materials perpetrated by a current or former employee(s) [with the
intent to [sell]{.mark} it [to]{.mark} a **[Chinese
competitor]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In the academic sector, [researchers
have stolen **information** or **samples** from their

[individuals would sell the **trade secrets** and **information** to
**Chinese companies** [that]{.mark} planned to
**[commercialize]{.mark}** the [stolen]{.mark} [trade

In addition to these cases, biotech firms have also reportedly been a
major target of state-sponsored cyber espionage. According to US-based
cybersecurity firm Mandiant, there has been an increased number of
hacking incidents targeting biotech companies from China since 2008, and
these activities are associated with government-directed groups. 299

The [recent [emergence]{.mark} of [a]{.mark} **[thriving]{.mark}
[biopharma]{.mark}**ceuticals **industry** [in China]{.mark} is no
longer just a China story]{.underline}. [It is a **[global]{.mark}
one**]{.underline}, [with **[profound]{.mark}
[implications]{.mark}**]{.underline} for years to come.

For the past 15 years competitive intensity in the global biopharma
market has increased markedly. Most recently, [China has emerged as an
important actor in the global biopharma ecosystem]{.underline},
[[adding]{.mark} a **potent additional [source]{.mark}** [of]{.mark}
[global]{.mark} **biopharma [innovation]{.mark}**]{.underline} and
disruption. What impact will this emergence of China have on the global
industry? First, here are a few important facts underpinning the rise of
China biopharma:

China biopharma has very good access to the necessary ingredients for
innovation:

Funding -- The cumulative market value of China originating biotechs,
listed on HKEX, STAR or NASDAQ, rose from \$1bn in 2016 to \$180bn as of
May 2021. CB Insights indicates that 2 of the top 10 global healthcare
VC funds are from China (Hillhouse Capital and Qiming Ventures --
ranking as of Q1 2021). Increasingly, China linked funds deploy capital
beyond China, to support the emergence of US based innovative start-ups
(numerous examples, from Lilly Asia Ventures, to Ally Bridge Group, or
Quan Capital). Of note, investments in Europe are more limited to date.
A new report by McKinsey " Innovation hot-spots to stage the next
Biotech act in Europe" concludes that China accounted only for 2% of
early-stage funding in European biotechs, over the 2018-2020 period.
Also, new funding models are emerging. For example, with backing from
Orbimed Asia partners, Kinnate Biopharma, a US based biopharma, recently
raised \$35mn to set up a JV in China for development and
commercialization of its lead program in greater China.

CDMOs and CROs -- The cumulative market value of listed players, defined
as focused on innovative drug development and listed on HKEX, STAR, or
NASDAQ, rose from \<\$1bn in 2016 to \$176bn as of May 2021. China is
already a leading provider of services in sub-segments, with a global
client base (e.g., in Chemistry). CDMO is rapidly scaling up with
examples of China/US tie-ups. For example, Humanigen (US based) recently
selected Chime biologics (China based) for the development of its lead
pipeline candidate, lenzilumab. Some China originating companies are
building global manufacturing networks. Wuxi Biologics is opening
facilities in Singapore, Ireland or Worcester, USA, while CARsgen is
investing \$157 mn to set up a North Carolina based CAR-T
Lab/manufacturing facility. On the CRO side, the recent merger of dMed
(China based) and Clinipace (US based) provides an illustration of the
increasing interdependency or service providers, who need to span
US-China to leverage the best capabilities and serve global clients.

Talent pool -- China's role in the global talent market is rising, with
some companies rapidly transitioning from being "China based" to being
"globally based". This involves hiring key CEO-1 talent who come from
traditional big pharma players, and play global positions/roles from
their home country. As recent examples, BeiGene hired its Senior VP of
Global Human resources from Pfizer, and Zai Lab hired its President,
head of global development for oncology from Genentech. Both executives
are based in the US. Also, several CEOs of Chinese biotechs are former
global executive of multinationals (e.g., the CEO of Everest Medicines
spent most of his career at Eli Lilly, while the Chairman and CEO of
CStone came from Sanofi).

The [role and [impact of]{.mark} China is [already]{.mark}
**[evident]{.mark}** across **key elements** of the **value
chain**]{.underline}:

**[Discovery]{.underline}** -- Initially, local innovation for the China
market focused on the immuno-oncology space (\~110 NMEs in the clinical
development as of May 2021). Acknowledging this hyper-competition,
[[China]{.mark} biopharma's [innovation]{.mark} focus has **broadened
significantly** into all major modalities and disease
areas]{.underline}. Our analysis shows that [for 9 out of 10 modalities
and for 9 out of 13 disease areas]{.underline}, [local companies are now
[leading **MNCs**]{.mark} [in innovation]{.mark} for the **domestic
China market**]{.underline}. A recent publication by the IQVIA institute
("Global oncology trends 2021: Outlook to 2025) [estimates that
[China]{.mark}-headquartered companies are [developing **18%**]{.mark}
[of]{.mark} all early stage [oncology drugs]{.mark}]{.underline}, up
from 6% in 2015. Maybe even more striking, [the China share is already
**[13%]{.mark}** [for]{.mark} all [next]{.mark}-[gen]{.mark}eration
oncology [biotherapeutics]{.mark}]{.underline}. 2020 marked a turning
point with several examples of innovative drugs discovered in China
being licensed in by large global biopharmas. The deals between
AbbVie/I-Mab for I-Mab's CD47 or Lilly/Innovent for Innovent's PD-1
program come to mind. What's important to note is the speed at which new
drug innovation has proliferated in scope and scale. [[China]{.mark}
[biopharma]{.mark} is [becoming]{.mark}]{.underline} an **[[ever
faster]{.underline}]{.mark}** fast follower. While we have yet to see
much evidence of First in Class discovery out of China -- other than a
few green shoots -- one could reasonably expect this to change in the
mid-term.

**[Development]{.underline}** -- [[China accounts]{.mark} [for]{.mark} a
**[large share]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} **[development trials]{.mark}**
[for]{.mark} the]{.underline} top 25 [**[global]{.mark}** Biopharma
[companies]{.mark}]{.underline}. On average, China is currently
participating in \~21% of ongoing Phase 3 clinical trials from those
companies as of June 2021. Access to a large treatment naïve patient
pool is attractive, and a growing number of trial centers are reaching
international quality standards. One should note however that while
centers have grown, the number of centers and PIs with extensive MRCT
experience is still low and will continue to constrain China's
development capacity. IQVIA Institute estimates that there are 1,297
trial experienced sites globally for CAR-T therapies, 284 of which are
in China. Meanwhile, [[Chinese]{.mark} originated
[biopharma]{.mark}]{.underline}/biotechs [are [ramping up]{.mark} the
number of [trials]{.mark} **conducted [abroad]{.mark}**]{.underline},
for example in Australia, the US or EU.

[**Commercial**/**[access]{.mark}**]{.underline} -- a few
[[China]{.mark} originating [companies]{.mark}]{.underline} have
[started to [build]{.mark} physical [presence]{.mark} [in]{.mark} the
[US]{.mark}]{.underline}, including for commercial
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} access activities. BeiGene and Hutch-Med are
both ramping up their US presence, with new molecules launched/launching
soon. [The same is starting to happen in [Europe]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Some [US based companies]{.underline} are [starting to emerge with the
idea of **licensing innovative molecules** from China]{.underline} and
launching them in the US. EQRx for example has a licensing deal with
Hansoh Pharma for aumolertinib, an EGFR TKI indicated for treatment of
NSCLC. The stated strategy aims at disrupting the current price/volume
status quo. C

#### Pharma innovation stops [extinction]{.underline} from [natural]{.underline} disease and [bioweapons]{.underline}\-\--extinction.

of Oxford, Future of Humanity Institute, and Andrew Snyder-Beattie, MS,

[In the decades to come, **[advanced bio]{.mark}weapons** could
[threaten]{.mark} **human [existence]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Although
the probability of human extinction from bioweapons may be low, the
expected value of reducing the risk could still be large, since such
risks jeopardize the existence of all future generations. We provide an
overview of biotechnological extinction risk, make some rough initial
estimates for how severe the risks might be, and compare the
cost-effectiveness of reducing these extinction-level risks with
existing biosecurity work. We find that reducing human extinction risk
can be more cost-effective than reducing smaller-scale risks, even when
using conservative estimates. This suggests that the risks are not low
enough to ignore and that more ought to be done to prevent the
worst-case scenarios.

How worthwhile is it spending resources to study and mitigate the chance
of human extinction from biological risks? The risks of such a
catastrophe are presumably low, so a skeptic might argue that addressing
such risks would be a waste of scarce resources. In this article, we
investigate this position using a cost-effectiveness approach and
ultimately conclude that the expected value of reducing these risks is
large, especially since such risks jeopardize the existence of all
future human lives.

[Historically, **[disease]{.mark}** events [have been responsible
for]{.mark} the **[great]{.mark}est [death tolls]{.mark}** on
**humanity**. The 1918 flu was responsible for more than **50 million**
deaths]{.underline},1 [while smallpox killed perhaps **10 times** that
many]{.underline} in the 20th century alone.2 [The Black Death was
responsible for killing over 25% of the European
population]{.underline},[3 while other pandemics]{.underline}, such as
the plague of Justinian, [are thought to have killed 25 million in the
6th century]{.underline}---constituting over 10% of the world\'s
population at the time.4 It is an open question whether [[a future
pandemic could result in]{.mark} outright **human [extinction]{.mark}**
or the irreversible **collapse of civilization**]{.underline}.

[A skeptic would]{.underline} have many good reasons to
[think]{.underline} that [existential risk from disease is
**unlikely**]{.underline}. Such a disease would need to spread worldwide
to remote populations, overcome rare genetic resistances, and evade
detection, cures, and countermeasures. Even evolution itself may work in
humanity\'s favor: Virulence and transmission is often a trade-off, and
so evolutionary pressures could push against maximally lethal wild-type
pathogens.5,6

While [these arguments]{.underline} point to a very small risk of human
extinction, they [do **not** rule the possibility out
entirel]{.underline}y. Although rare, [there are recorded instances of
species going extinct due to disease]{.underline}---primarily [in
amphibians]{.underline}, but also in 1 mammalian species of rat on
Christmas Island.7,8 [[There are]{.underline}]{.mark} also [historical
[examples of]{.mark} large human [populations]{.mark} being almost
entirely [wiped out]{.mark} by disease, [especially when
**multiple**]{.mark} diseases were **simultaneously** introduced into a
population without **immunity**]{.underline}. The most striking examples
of total population collapse include native American tribes exposed to
European diseases, such as the Massachusett (86% loss of population),
Quiripi-Unquachog (95% loss of population), and the Western Abenaki
(which suffered a staggering 98% loss of population).9

In the modern context, no single disease currently exists that combines
the worst-case levels of transmissibility, lethality, resistance to
countermeasures, and global reach. But many diseases are proof of
principle that [[each]{.mark} worst-case [attribute **can** be
realized]{.mark} **independently**]{.underline}. For example,
[[some]{.mark} diseases [exhibit]{.mark} nearly a **[100%]{.mark} case
[fatality]{.mark} ratio** in the absence of treatment]{.underline}, such
as rabies or septicemic plague. [Other diseases have a track record of
**[spreading]{.mark}** to virtually every human community
**[worldwide]{.mark}**, such as the 1918 flu]{.underline},10 and
seroprevalence studies indicate that other pathogens, such as chickenpox
and HSV-1, can successfully reach over 95% of a population.11,12 Under
optimal virulence theory, natural evolution would be an unlikely source
for pathogens with the highest possible levels of transmissibility,
virulence, and global reach. But [[advances in
**biotech**]{.mark}**nology** might [allow]{.mark} the creation of
diseases that **[combine]{.mark}** such traits]{.underline}. Recent
controversy has already emerged over a number of [scientific
experiments]{.underline} that [resulted in viruses with enhanced
[**transmissibility**, **lethality**, and]{.mark}/or the [ability to
**overcome therapeutics**]{.mark}]{.underline}.13-17 Other experiments
demonstrated that mousepox could be modified to have a 100% case
fatality rate and render a vaccine ineffective.18 In addition to
transmissibility and lethality, studies have shown that other disease
traits, such as [incubation time, environmental survival, and available
vectors, could be **modified** as well]{.underline}.19-21

Although these experiments had scientific merit and were not conducted
with malicious intent, their implications are still worrying. This is
especially true given that [there is]{.underline} also [a long
historical track record of state-run **bioweapon research** applying
cutting-edge science and technology to design agents not previously seen
in nature]{.underline}. The Soviet bioweapons program developed agents
with traits such as enhanced virulence, resistance to therapies, greater
environmental resilience, increased difficulty to diagnose or treat, and
which caused unexpected disease presentations and outcomes.22 Delivery
capabilities have also been subject to the cutting edge of technical
development, with Canadian, US, and UK bioweapon efforts playing a
critical role in developing the discipline of aerobiology.23,24 While
there is no evidence of state-run bioweapons programs directly
attempting to develop or deploy bioweapons that would pose an
existential risk, the logic of deterrence and mutually assured
destruction could create such incentives in more unstable political
environments or following a breakdown of the Biological Weapons
Convention.25 The possibility of a war between great powers could also
increase the pressure to use such weapons---during the World Wars,
bioweapons were used across multiple continents, with Germany targeting
animals in WWI,26 and Japan using plague to cause an epidemic in China
during WWII.27

[[Non-state actors may]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[pose a risk,]{.mark}
especially those with explicitly **omnicidal aims**]{.underline}. While
rare, there are examples. The [Aum Shinrikyo]{.underline} cult in Japan
[sought biological weapons for the express purpose of causing
extinction]{.underline}.28 Environmental groups, such as the Gaia
Liberation Front, have argued that "we can ensure Gaia\'s survival only
through the extinction of the Humans as a species ... we now have the
specific technology for doing the job ... several different
\[genetically engineered\] viruses could be released"(quoted in ref.
29). Groups such as R.I.S.E. also sought to protect nature by destroying
most of humanity with bioweapons.30 Fortunately, to date, [non-state
actors have lacked]{.underline} the [capabilities]{.underline} needed to
pose a catastrophic bioweapons threat, [but this could
change]{.underline} in future decades [[as
**biotech**]{.underline}]{.mark}nology [[becomes]{.mark} more
[accessible]{.mark}]{.underline} and the pool of experienced users
grows.31,32

What is the appropriate response to these speculative extinction
threats? A balanced biosecurity portfolio might include investments that
reduce a mix of proven and speculative risks, but striking this balance
is still difficult given the massive uncertainties around the
low-probability, high-consequence risks. In this article, we examine the
traditional spectrum of biosecurity risks (ie, biocrimes, bioterrorism,
and biowarfare) to categorize biothreats by likelihood and impact,
expanding the historical analysis to consider even lower-probability,
higher-consequence events (catastrophic risks and existential risks). In
order to produce reasoned estimates of the likelihood of different
categories of biothreats, we bring together relevant data and theory and
produce some first-guess estimates of the likelihood of different
categories of biothreat, and we use these initial estimates to compare
the cost-effectiveness of reducing existential risks with more
traditional biosecurity measures. We emphasize that these models are
highly uncertain, and their utility lies more in enabling
order-of-magnitude comparisons rather than as a precise measure of the
true risk. However, even with the most conservative models, we find that
reduction of low-probability, high-consequence risks can be more
cost-effective, as measured by quality-adjusted life year per dollar,
especially when we account for the lives of future generations. This
suggests that despite the low probability of such events, society still
ought to invest more in preventing the most extreme possible biosecurity
catastrophes.

Here, we use historical data to analyze the probability and severity of
biothreats. We place biothreats in 6 loose categories: incidents,
events, disasters, crises, global catastrophic risk, and existential
risk. Together they form an overlapping spectrum of increasing impact
and decreasing likelihood (Figure 1).\*

A spectrum of differing impacts and likelihoods from biothreats. Below
each category of risk is the number of human fatalities. We loosely
define global catastrophic risk as being 100 million fatalities, and
existential risk as being the total extinction of humanity. Alternative
definitions can be found in previous reports,33 as well as within this
journal issue.34

The historical use of bioweapons provides useful examples of some
categories of biothreats. Biocrimes and bioterrorism provide examples of
incidents.† Biological warfare provides examples of events and
disasters. These historical examples provide indicative data on
likelihood and impact that we can then feed into a cost-effectiveness
analysis. We should note that these data are both sparse and sometimes
controversial. Where possible, we use multiple datasets to corroborate
our numbers, but ultimately the "true rate" of bioweapon attacks is
highly uncertain.

Historically, risks of biocrime‡ and bioterrorism§ have been limited. A
2015 Risk and Benefit Analysis for Gain of Function Research detailed 24
biocrimes between 1990 and 2015 (0.96 per year) and an additional 42
bioterrorism incidents between 1972 and 2014 (1 per year).36 This is
consistent with other estimates of biocrimes and bioterrorism frequency,
which range from 0.35 to 3.5 per year (see supplementary material, part
1, at http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/suppl/10.1089/hs.2017.0028).

Most attacks typically result in no more than a handful of casualties
(and many of these events include hoaxes, threats, and attacks that had
no casualties at all). For example, the anthrax letter attacks in the
United States in 2001, perhaps the most high-profile case in recent
years, resulted in only 17 infections with 5 fatalities.37 The 2015 Risk
and Benefit Analysis for Gain of Function Research detailed only a
single death from the recorded biocrimes.\*\* Only 1 of the bioterrorism
incidents in the report had associated deaths (the 2001 anthrax letter
attacks).36 Based on this data, for the purposes of this article, we
assume that we could expect 1 incident per year resulting in up to tens
of deaths.

Academic overviews of biological warfare†† detail 7 programs prior to
1945.38 A further 9 programs are recorded between 1945 and 1994.39 For
most of the last century, at least 1 program was active in any given
year (Table 1).

The actual use of bioweapons by states is less common: Over the 85 years
covered by these histories (1915 to 2000), 18 cases of use (or possible
use) were recorded, including outbreaks connected to biological warfare
(see supplementary material, part 2, at
http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/suppl/10.1089/hs.2017.0028).
Extrapolating this out (dividing 18 by 85), we would have about a 20%
chance per year of biowarfare. It is worth noting the limitations of
these data. Most of these events occurred before the introduction of the
Biological Weapons Convention and were conducted by countries that no
longer have biological weapons programs. Since many of these incidents
occurred during infrequent great power wars, we revise our best guess to
around 10% chance per year of biowarfare.

We use 2 sets of data to estimate the magnitude of such events. The
first dataset was Japanese biological warfare in China,40 where records
indicate a series of attacks on towns resulted in a mean of 330
casualties per event and 1 case in which an attack resulted in a
regional outbreak causing an estimated 30,000 deaths (see supplementary
material, part 3, at
http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/suppl/10.1089/hs.2017.0028). The second
data set came from disease events that were alleged to have an unnatural
origin.41 In one case study, a point source release of anthrax resulted
in at least 66 deaths. In a second case study, a regional epidemic of
the same disease resulted in more than 17,000 human cases. While these
events were not confirmed as having been caused by biological warfare,
contemporary or subsequent analysis has suggested that such an origin
was at least feasible. Combined, these figures provide an estimated
impact of between 66 to 330 and 17,000 to 30,000.

For the purposes of this analysis, we are assuming the lower boundary
figures from biological warfare are indicative of events, with a
likelihood of 10% per year and an impact ranging between tens and
thousands of fatalities. The upper boundary figures from biological
warfare are indicative of disasters, with a likelihood of 1% per year
and an impact range of thousands to tens of thousands of fatalities.‡‡

Unlike standard biothreats, there is no historical record on which to
draw when considering global catastrophic or existential risks.
Alternative approaches are required to estimate the likelihood of such
an event. Given the high degree of uncertainty, we adopt 3 different
approaches to approximate the risk of extinction from bioweapons:
utilizing surveys of experts, previous major risk assessments, and
simple toy models. These should be taken as initial guesses or rough
order-of-magnitude approximations, and not a reliable or precise
measure.

An informal survey at the 2008 Oxford Global Catastrophic Risk
Conference asked participants to estimate the chance that disasters of
different types would occur before 2100. Participants had a median risk
estimate of 0.05% that a natural pandemic would lead to human extinction
by 2100, and a median risk estimate of 2% that an "engineered" pandemic
would lead to extinction by 2100.42

The advantage of the survey is that it directly measures the quantity
that we are interested in: probability of extinction from bioweapons.
The disadvantage is that the estimates were likely highly subjective and
unreliable, especially as the survey did not account for response bias,
and the respondents were not calibrated beforehand. We therefore also
turn to other models that, while indirect, provide more objective
measures of risk.§§

Recent controversial experiments on H5N1 influenza prompted discussions
as to the risks of deliberately creating potentially pandemic pathogens.
These agents are those that are highly transmissible, capable of
uncontrollable spread in human populations, highly virulent, and also
possibly able to overcome medical countermeasures.44 Previous work in a
comprehensive report done by Gryphon Scientific, Risk and Benefit
Analysis of Gain of Function Research,36 has laid out very detailed risk
assessments of potentially pandemic pathogen research, suggesting that
the annual probability of a global pandemic resulting from an accident
with this type of research in the United States is 0.002% to 0.1%. The
report also concluded that risks of deliberate misuse were about as
serious as the risks of an accidental outbreak, suggesting a 2-fold
increase in risk. Assuming that 25% of relevant research is done in the
United States as opposed to elsewhere in the world, this gives us a
further 4-fold increase in risk. In total, this 8-fold increase in risk
gives us a 0.016% to 0.8% chance of a pandemic in the future each year
(see supplementary material, part 4, at
http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/suppl/10.1089/hs.2017.0028).

The analysis in Risk and Benefit Analysis of Gain of Function Research
suggested that lab outbreaks from wild-type influenza viruses could
result in between 4 million and 80 million deaths,36 but others have
suggested that if some of the modified pathogens were to escape from a
laboratory, they could cause up to 1 billion fatalities.45 For the
purposes of this model, we assume that for any global pandemic arising
from this kind of research, each has only a 1 in 10,000\*\*\* chance of
causing an existential risk. This figure is somewhat arbitrary but
serves as an excessively conservative guess that would include
worst-case situations in which scientists intentionally cause harm,
where civilization permanently collapses following a particularly bad
outbreak, or other worst-case scenarios that would result in existential
risk. Multiplying the probability of an outbreak with the probability of
an existential risk gives us an annual risk probability between
1.6 × 10--8 and 8 × 10--7.†††

Previous literature has found that casualty numbers from terrorism and
warfare follow a power law distribution, including terrorism from
WMDs.46 Power laws have the property of being scale invariant, meaning
that the ratio in likelihood between events that cause the deaths of 10
people and 10,000 people will be the same as that between 10,000 people
and 10,000,000 people.‡‡‡ This property results in a distribution with
an exceptionally heavy tail, so that the vast majority of events will
have very low casualty rates, with a couple of extreme outliers.

Past studies have estimated this ratio for terrorism using biological
and chemical weapons to be about 0.5 for 1 order of magnitude,47 meaning
that an attack that kills 10x people is about 3 times less likely
(100.5) than an attack that kills 10x--1 people (a concrete example is
that attacks with more than 1,000 casualties, such as the Aum Shinrikyo
attacks, will be about 30 times less probable than an attack that kills
a single individual). Extrapolating the power law out, we find that the
probability that an attack kills more than 5 billion will be (5
billion)--0.5 or 0.000014. Assuming 1 attack per year (extrapolated on
the current rate of bio-attacks) and assuming that only 10% of such
attacks that kill more than 5 billion eventually lead to extinction (due
to the breakdown of society, or other knock-on effects), we get an
annual existential risk of 0.0000014 (or 1.4 × 10--6).

We can also use similar reasoning for warfare, where we have more
reliable data (97 wars between 1820 and 1997, although the data are less
specific to biological warfare). The parameter for warfare is 0.41,47
suggesting that wars that result in more than 5 billion casualties will
comprise (5 billion)--0.41 = 0.0001 of all wars. Our estimate assumes
that wars will occur with the same frequency as in 1820 to 1997, with 1
new war arising roughly every 2 years. It also assumes that in these
extreme outlier scenarios, nuclear or contagious biological weapons
would be the cause of such high casualty numbers, and that bioweapons
specifically would be responsible for these enormous casualties about
10% of the time (historically bioweapons were deployed in WWI, WWII, and
developed but not deployed in the Cold War---constituting a bioweapons
threat in every great power war since 1900). Assuming that 10% of
biowarfare escalations resulting in more than 5 billion deaths
eventually lead to extinction, we get an annual existential risk from
biowarfare of 0.0000005 (or 5 × 10--7).

Perhaps the most interesting implication of the fatalities following a
power law with a small exponent is that the majority of the expected
casualties come from rare, catastrophic events. The data also bear this
out for warfare and terrorism. The vast majority of US terrorism deaths
occurred during 9/11, and the vast majority of terrorism injuries in
Japan over the past decades came from a single Aum Shinrikyo attack.
Warfare casualties are dominated by the great power wars. This suggests
that a typical individual is far more likely to die from a rare,
catastrophic attack as opposed to a smaller scale and more common one.
If our goal is to reduce the greatest expected number of fatalities, we
may be better off devoting resources to preventing the worst possible
attacks.

Each of our estimates rely to some extent on guesswork and remain highly
uncertain. [**[Tech]{.mark}**nological [breakthroughs in]{.mark} areas
such as **[diagnostics]{.mark}**, vaccines, [and
therapeutics]{.mark}]{.underline}, as well as vastly improved
surveillance, or even eventual space colonization, [[could
**reduce**]{.mark} the [chance of]{.mark} **disease-related
[extinction]{.mark}** [by]{.mark} **many [orders of magnitude]{.mark}**.
Other breakthroughs such as highly distributed DNA synthesis or improved
understanding of how to construct and modify diseases could increase or
decrease the risks. Destabilizing political forces]{.underline}, the
breakdown of the Biological Weapons Convention, or warfare between major
world powers [could vastly increase the amount of investment in
bioweapons and create the incentives to actively use knowledge and
biotechnology in destructive ways]{.underline}. Each of these factors
suggests that our wide estimates could still be many orders of magnitude
off from the true risk in this century. But uncertainty is not cause for
reassurance. In instances where the probability of a catastrophe is
thought to be extremely low (eg, human extinction from bioweapons),
greater uncertainty around the estimates will typically imply greater
risk of the catastrophe, as we have reduced confidence that the risk is
actually at a low level.48 §§§

Given that our [conservative models]{.underline} are based on historical
data, they fail [to account for the primary source of future risk:
technological development that could radically democratize the ability
to build advanced bioweapons. If the cost and required expertise of
developing bioweapons falls far enough, the world might enter a phase
where offensive capabilities dominate defensive ones]{.underline}. Some
scholars, such as Martin Rees, think that [humanity has about a **50%
chance** of going **extinct** due in large part to such
technologies]{.underline}.49 However, incorporating these intuitions and
technological conjectures would mean relying on qualitative arguments
that would be far more contentious than our conservative estimates. We
therefore proceed to assess the cost-effectiveness on the basis of our
conservative models, until superior models of the risk emerge.

[Chinese **cyber espionage**]{.underline} actors have
[evolved]{.underline} their [operations to **closely align** with
national-level priorities around **economic development** and **national
defense**]{.underline}, a recent report revealed.

In Mandiant's M-Trends report released this week, researchers said in
2021 the number of Chinese espionage groups in the landscape dropped
from at least 244 separate Chinese actor sets, tracked over the last
five years, to 36 active groups, pointing to a "more focused,
professionalized, and sophisticated attacks conducted by a smaller set
of actors."

This smaller set of groups, which include existing and known groups like
APT10, APT41, and the Conference Crew group, have [retooled and
pivoted]{.underline} their [strategies to better align with China's
**overall strategy**]{.underline}, which is [encapsulated by its most
recent **Five Year plan**]{.underline}, launched in early 2021. This
plan focuses on supporting the nation's Belt and Road Initiative, its
long-term policy and investment program that centers on infrastructure
and economic development, which aims for national self-reliance through
growing domestic markets versus a previous strategy that relied on trade
agreements. The [plan]{.underline} also f[ocuses on markets like
**tech**]{.underline}nology, [financials]{.underline},
[energy]{.underline}, [**telecommunications** and
**healthcare**]{.underline}.

"These [national-level priorities signal an **upcoming increase** in
China-nexus actors conducting **intrusion** attempts against
**i**]{.underline}ntellectual **[p]{.underline}**roperty or other
strategically important economic concerns, as well as defense industry
products and other dual-use technologies over the next few years," said
researchers with Mandiant.

The Emergence of a New Strategy

While espionage has long been a goal for China-nexus APTs, with APT1
being disclosed in 2013 after launching a multi-year, enterprise scale
espionage campaign, the groups have evolved based on national-level
strategies. China's national goals early on revolved around asserting
itself internationally. Then, between 2014 to 2016, researchers observed
an overall decline in activity by China-nexus groups, which they said
may have been due to transitions within China's government.

"The apparent decline in observable incidents may reflect the shift
within China's own bureaucracy, where the centralization of state power
and the restructuring of the military apparatus resulted in a move away
from prolific amateur cyber-attacks in favor of more focused,
professionalized, and sophisticated attacks conducted by a smaller set
of actors," said researchers.

In 2017, researchers observed espionage actors both re-emerge with new
malware, or reorganize in completely new groups. Since then, researchers
have steadily observed actors' technical tradecraft steadily evolving to
become "stealthier and more agile, while taking measures to complicate
attribution." The actors have been launching supply-chain attacks and
relying on zero-day flaws such as the Microsoft Exchange ProxyLogon
vulnerabilities or flaws in Pulse Secure VPNs.

In a February testimony before the U.S.-China Economic and Security
Review Commission, researchers said they believe [Chinese cyber
espionage activity]{.underline} has [shown a]{.underline} "[**higher
tolerance** for **risk** and is **less constrained** by norms or
diplomatic pressures]{.underline}." Researchers also observed resources
being shared across groups over the past year, with multiple Chinese
espionage actors using the same malware, signaling a centralized
development and distribution center.

"Chinese cyber espionage operators' use of vulnerability exploitation,
third party compromise, and software supply chain compromise exemplify
both the scale of Chinese state-sponsored threat activity and the
strategic evolution in use of tactics to maximize efficiency and
impact," said Kelli Vanderlee, senior manager of strategic analysis with
Mandiant threat intelligence.

The Future of Chinese Cyber Espionage Activity

Researchers also pointed to China acquiring network infrastructure
behind devices like the Internet of Things (IoT), which raises concerns
that it could "create a pervasive system that can be exploited by China
for both internal and external reconnaissance and surveillance
campaigns."

"This strategy has already proven successful as Beijing is able to
target hardened, more challenging targets indirectly through various
supply chain and third-party victim compromises to extract political,
economic, defense and surveillance information," said researchers.

Asia and the [U.S.]{.underline} are the **[top region]{.underline}**s
[targeted by these Chinese espionage groups]{.underline}, with 15
percent of their victims being U.S. entities. At the same time, seven of
the current 36 APTs have collected sensitive data from public entities,
showing that [governmental organizations continue to be the **most
targeted sector**]{.underline}. This has caused concerns by U.S.
governmental organizations: An Annual Threat Intelligence report by the
Office of the Director of National Intelligence assessed that
[China]{.underline} "[presents the **broadest**]{.underline}, [most
**active** and **persistent** **cyber espionage threat**]{.underline}"
[to U.S. government]{.underline} and private sector
[networks]{.underline}.

In March, a report showed that the APT41 group compromised at least six
U.S. state government networks between May and February in a "deliberate
campaign" that reflects new attack vectors and retooling by the prolific
Chinese state-sponsored group. Also in March, the Google Threat Analysis
Group (TAG) issued a warning that they detected a phishing campaign by
China-linked espionage group APT31 targeting "high-profile Gmail users
affiliated with the U.S. government" in February. Researchers said that
[espionage targets are carefully selected and derived from
**governmental priorities**]{.underline}, including China's Five-Year
plans, policy platforms or national defense strategies.

"[Given the more aggressive nature of Beijing's international
diplomacy]{.underline}, [along with]{.underline} the broader [cyber
espionage campaigns]{.underline} conducted by China-nexus threat actors,
[we anticipate]{.underline} that [cyber espionage activity in support of
China's national security and economic interests will **continue to
accelerate** in the **coming year**]{.underline}," said Mandiant
researchers.

Beijing's hackers were once known for simple smash-and-grab operations,
the country is now among the best in the world thanks to a strategy of
tightened control, big spending, and an infrastructure for feeding
hacking tools to the government that is unlike anything else in the
world.

This change has been going on for years, driven right from the very top.
Soon after he ascended to power, [President Xi]{.underline} Jinping
[began]{.underline} a [**reorganization** of China's military and

capabilities

The [results are new tools and tactics that have **rapidly** become more

[[Chinese]{.mark} intelligence [officer]{.mark}]{.underline} Yanjun
[Xu]{.underline} is awaiting sentencing in federal court after he was
[[convicted of]{.underline}]{.mark} attempted [theft of **trade
secrets** and]{.underline} economic [[espionage]{.underline}]{.mark}
last month. The U.S. government charged him with trying to steal
sensitive engine technology from a U.S. aviation company by extracting
information from an employee.

Xu's purpose, intelligence officials say, was to hand that technology
over to a Chinese company that the Chinese government hopes could rival
Airbus and Boeing.

Xu is the first Chinese intelligence officer extradited to the U.S. to
stand trial for espionage, according to the Department of Justice. (He
was arrested in Belgium.) But U.S. prosecutors have been accusing
Chinese spies of stealing trade secrets for years.

The [[list of]{.mark} [victims]{.mark} is
**[long]{.mark}**]{.underline}: solar and steel companies, makers of
computer chips and airplanes, [[labs doing]{.mark} **[COVID-]{.mark}19
[research]{.mark}**]{.underline}, **[[health care]{.mark}
[companies]{.mark}]{.underline}**, universities --- it goes on and on.

"And [it is most certainly [guided by]{.mark} the **[Chinese
government]{.mark}**]{.underline}," said Michael Orlando, acting
director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, a
government agency that focuses on threats from foreign powers.

"[[China has]{.mark} a [number of]{.mark} national
[plans]{.mark}]{.underline}, which include Made in China 2025 and their
14th five-year plan, [which lists about **10 technologies**]{.underline}
that [they are [seeking]{.mark} to **[dominate]{.mark}**
in]{.underline}," he said.

[These include technologies]{.underline} upon which the industries and
wealth generators of the future depend, [like]{.underline} artificial
intelligence, quantum information systems,
**[[biotech]{.underline}]{.mark}**, semiconductors and autonomous
systems.

"The [Chinese government is [using]{.mark} all instruments of national
power]{.underline}, [from **[espionage]{.mark}** to legal
acquisitions]{.underline} and joint ventures [[to acquire]{.mark}
specific [tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nologies, [so they can
be]{.underline} the world **[leaders]{.underline}** in those
technologies," Orlando said, adding that [China's [government]{.mark}
will [use **whatever means necessary**]{.mark}]{.underline} --- [legal
and **illegal**]{.underline}.

That has been plain to see for Mark Widmar. He's CEO of First Solar, the
only large-scale U.S. solar cell manufacturer to survive competition
from China's --- at one point --- highly subsidized solar industry.

First Solar uses a specialized technology for its solar panels that
Chinese companies do not have and are, he said, trying to acquire one
way or another.

"We spend a lot of time around cybersecurity because we are constantly
being attacked, and we know a lot of the efforts are being done with
companies in China to get access to our data and our information,"
Widmar said.

At the same time, Chinese companies are using more above-board methods,
as well.

"I have been approached by Chinese associates requesting us to
manufacture in China, and they have highlighted benefits they would be
willing to provide around subsidies, not having to pay for buildings,
highly subsidized capital and other benefits they would provide," he
said.

Despite the allure, Widmar's refused. "Because we don't want to expose
our technology to potential risk of theft, so we've stayed away from
manufacturing in China, and that's one thing that's helped us."

China views national security and economic security as one and the same,
said Anna Puglisi, director of biotechnology programs and senior fellow
at Georgetown University's Center for Security and Emerging Technology.

"[[China]{.underline}]{.mark} really [[looks at]{.mark} development of
**[science]{.mark}** [and]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[[tech]{.underline}]{.mark}**nology [[as
**zero-sum**]{.underline}]{.mark}," she said. "[That's]{.underline}
really [the **driver** behind]{.underline} a lot of [the
activities]{.underline} that we see."

The importance of this is understood at the highest levels, Puglisi
said. In a National Development and Reform Commission report from 2017,
"\[Chinese [President [Xi]{.mark}]{.underline} Jinping\]
[[describes]{.mark} science and]{.underline} [tech]{.underline}nology
[[as]{.mark} a **[national weapon]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [that if China
wants to be strong]{.underline}, [it must have a powerful science and
tech]{.underline}nology," she said.

[Xi]{.underline} has [repeated]{.underline} similar language in a more
recent speech, [where he called science and tech]{.underline}nology "[a
**sharp weapon for development**]{.underline}" and said that "if science
and technology are strong, the country will be strong."

When it comes to sensitive technologies, the relationship between
Chinese firms and their government is different than in economies like
the United States, Korea, Japan or Europe. Chinese firms can ask
specialized "science and technology diplomats" to help them connect with
foreign companies that have the technology they need, Puglisi said. "And
\[those diplomats\] help and try and broker those kinds of arrangements
and collaborations or business deals.

The arrangements between the U.S. and Chinese companies have, at times,
opened the way for the transfer of that technology to Chinese
businesses, both in legal and illegal ways.

"Nonmarket decision-making and state subsidies give unfair advantage to
China's companies and forces U.S. and other Western companies to have to
make concessions and give up technology they do not have to do other
places in the world," Puglisi said.

In one example of alleged forced technology transfer on American soil,
several former executives of aviation startup Icon Aircraft ---
including former Boeing CEO Philip Condit --- argued in a lawsuit that
Chinese majority shareholders lifted Icon's intellectual property on
design and manufacturing.

Chinese firms can also ask China's intelligence services for help, said
Roy Kamphausen, president of the National Bureau of Asian Research and
executive director of the Commission on the Theft of American
Intellectual Property.

"Can you imagine if a major American company could say to the U.S.
government, 'Hey we're entering into negotiations with a partner in X,
Y, Z country, can the CIA help answer these questions about this
company's operations and trade secrets?' Even as you say those words,
it's ridiculous, but it's a very real thing that's happening,"
Kamphausen said.

He and intelligence officials say hacking --- like the cyberattacks
First Solar endures --- have been a powerful tool used by China's
government to extract technology and economic advantage from foreign
companies.

"Well, it's massive, we'll start with that," said Adam Meyers, senior
vice president of intelligence at CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity firm.

In 2015, U.S. President Barack Obama, Xi Jinping by his side, announced
an agreement between the two leaders that neither country would "conduct
or knowingly support cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property" for
commercial gain.

China has not lived up to that commitment, and in a recent report,
CrowdStrike called it "one of the most prolific state-sponsored cyber
actors on the planet,"

[[Cyberattacks]{.mark} launched by]{.underline} any of the 51 groups in
[China]{.underline} tracked by CrowdStrike --- including groups

Security and Public Safety, as well as regional intelligence services

[ambitions]{.mark} for **industries** and **technologies** the
government wants]{.underline} its country [[to
**dominate**]{.underline}]{.mark}, Meyers said.

"[There's just a **huge shopping list**]{.underline}," he said. And [the
attacks have been **evolving**]{.underline}, Meyers added.

### 2NC\-\--Impact\-\--China Econ

#### The Chinese economy is rebounding despite COVID -- but recovery isn't [locked in]{.underline}

**Liu et. Al 6/29**/22 -- John Liu, executive editor at Bloomberg News
("China's Economy Shows Signs of Improvement as Covid Eases", *Bloomberg
News*, 6/29/22,

[**[China's economy showed]{.mark} further signs of
[improvement]{.mark}** in June with a [strong pickup]{.mark} in services
and construction [as Covid outbreaks]{.mark} and [restrictions]{.mark}
[were]{.mark} gradually [eased]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[The official **[manufacturing]{.mark} purchasing managers [index
rose]{.mark}** to 50.2 from 49.6 in May]{.underline}, the National
Bureau of Statistics said Thursday, slightly below the median estimate
of 50.5 in a Bloomberg survey of economists. [It was the [first time
since February]{.mark} that the index was above 50, indicating an
expansion in output compared with May.]{.underline}

[The **[non-manufacturing]{.mark} gauge**, which measures activity in
the construction and services sectors, **[climbed]{.mark}** [to]{.mark}
54.7, the **[highest in more than a year]{.mark}** and [well
above]{.mark} the [consensus]{.mark} [forecast]{.mark} of
50.5. ]{.underline}

["The Chinese economy bottomed out in June and the **[recovery
is]{.mark}** basically **[entrenched]{.mark}**, **[although attention
still needs to be paid]{.mark}** to imbalances between the recoveries in
supply and demand,"]{.underline} according to
a [[statement]{.underline}](http://www.clic.org.cn/pmizzypmi/308392.jhtml) from
the China Logistics Information Center, which publishes the PMI figures
in partnership with the NBS.

[China's benchmark CSI 300 Index rallied 1.6% by the mid-day break even
as most Asian stock markets were trading lower. Chinese [stocks]{.mark}
were also [boosted]{.mark} by news of further easing of virus-related
travel curbs. The offshore yuan strengthened as much as 0.2% after the
data release to 6.6935 a dollar.]{.underline}

Easing Lockdowns

[**Government restrictions to contain Covid outbreaks have gradually
eased** over the last month.]{.underline} The financial hub Shanghai
lifted its two-month lockdown at the start of June by allowing more
shops to reopen, more factories to resume production, and for port
operation to pick up.

[The data suggests "the **[pace]{.mark} of recovery
[accelerated]{.mark}** [as]{.mark} the [Covid]{.mark} situation
[stabilized]{.mark},"]{.underline} said Peiqian Liu, chief China
economist at NatWest Group Plc. There was a "broad based but still soft
recovery in both production and new orders," and the figures show the
rebound is still milder compared with the recovery from the Wuhan
lockdown in 2020, she said.

Some 19 of the 21 sectors in the service sectors tracked in the survey
returned to expansion last month, up from just six in the previous
month, NBS analyst Zhao Qinghe said in a
separate [[statement]{.underline}](http://www.stats.gov.cn/tjsj/sjjd/202206/t20220630_1858687.html).
[Gauges of sectors previously hit badly by the outbreaks all
improved,]{.underline} such as railway transport, air transport,
accommodation, catering and entertainment.

The pickup in the transportation industry helped shorten the time for
raw materials to reach manufacturing customers, with an index measuring
the delivery time of suppliers jumping to 51.3, the highest in more than
six years. A higher number indicates shorter delivery times, but that
improvement likely lowered the headline PMI figure because of the way
the data is calculated, economists said. 

Normally shorter shipping times means demand is contracting and so
indicates an economic slowdown. However this month, this indicates that
logistics are getting back to normal, and so the actual rebound in
manufacturing activity was likely stronger than the main PMI figure
shows, according to economists including Standard Chartered Plc.'s Ding
Shuang and Zhang Zhiwei at Pinpoint Asset Management Ltd.  

Smoother logistics also facilitated construction progress and boosted
confidence of the sector's companies in the business outlook, the NBS's
Zhao said.

Estimates by American industry and intelligence agencies put the value
of the stolen data in the hundreds of billions of dollars. Washington's
National Counterintelligence Executive flatly stated in a November 2011
report that [**[China]{.mark} is "[building]{.mark} its** **[economy" on
"US tech]{.mark}**nology, research, and development, and other sensitive
forms of intellectual property."]{.underline} While the commercial
payoffs are readily apparent, China's cyber espionage program is not
without risks. After all, Beijing doesn't merely seek wealth and power
but prestige and influence as well, and a reputation as a cyber outlaw
is not the best path to the high level of international legitimacy the
regime desperately seeks. And as it becomes more tightly integrated into
an interdependent global economy, and the international norms and bodies
that regulate and govern it, China is increasingly vulnerable to legal
pressures and sanctions, as well as stigmatization by its competitors in
the international community. The [**Chinese leadership has persisted in
its [cyber espionage]{.mark}**, despite these hazards, because it
believes that these **activities are [essential to]{.mark} the
[innovation-based economy]{.mark} it sees as its national future.** In
its twelfth five-year plan (2011--15), the government committed itself
to ensuring that the country's massive state-owned enterprises (SOEs)
would continue to dominate key sectors of its
economy]{.underline}---perhaps no surprise given that many of China's
unelected leaders and their families personally own large shares of
these companies. [The five-year plan also identified the [country's key
"strategic sectors]{.mark}" on [which]{.mark} its **[future
growth]{.mark}**, prosperity, and **[economic strength]{.mark}** would
[hinge]{.mark}: **[tech]{.mark}nology, [aerospace]{.mark},
telecommunications**, energy, transportation, engineering services, and
high-tech electronics. These [are]{.mark} the **[same sectors]{.mark}
that China's cyber [espionage has targeted]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[China's latest five-year plan incorporated the goals of a previously
issued report, the "National Medium- to Long-Term Plan for the
Development of Science and Technology." This 2006 "techno-nationalist"
plan called for 2.5 percent of GDP to be allocated to R&D with the goal
of reducing China's dependence on foreign technologies by
half]{.underline} by 2020, [leading the country to emerge as the world's
dominant innovation leader by mid-century. [China's
**state-owned**]{.mark} **[enterprises]{.mark} are viewed as [central
]{.mark}**[to achieving]{.mark} this [national goal]{.mark} and have
been accordingly given lavish access to cheap and often free capital to
fund innovation investment]{.underline}. [These [SOEs]{.mark}, some
managed nationally and some locally, **[own more than two-thirds of the
country's capital]{.mark} and fixed assets**, and invest more in the
country's twelve largest economic sectors (with the exception of export
manufacturing) than do privately owned businesses. The government places
special emphasis on those SOEs that operate in the specially designated
"strategic sectors" considered vital to the country's future global
leadership.]{.underline} [They [include]{.mark} [energy]{.mark} and
alternative fuel, [bio]{.mark}- and [nano-tech]{.mark}nology, high-end
and advanced [manufacturing]{.mark}, advanced materials such as
[r]{.mark}are [e]{.mark}arth [m]{.mark}etal[s]{.mark}, and information
technology and **[emerging tech]{.mark}nologies**.]{.underline} In
December 2010, [Beijing announced that it was **prepared to set aside
\$1.5 trillion** mainly for SOEs to invest in these sectors. The **SOEs
[receive more than three-quarters of]{.mark} all [China's]{.mark} formal
[financing]{.mark}** (i.e., bank loans), usually at below-market
interest rates, although they generate only about one-third of national
output]{.underline}, according to Minxin Pei, a leading political
economist focused on China. Of the nearly fifteen hundred firms listed
on China's two stock exchanges, all but fifty or so are either
majority-owned by the state or count the state as the largest and
dominant shareholder. [SOEs **[generate]{.mark} nearly [eighty-three
percent of]{.mark} the [combined revenues]{.mark}** and [own **more than
ninety percent of combined assets**]{.mark} **[of]{.mark} the [country's
leading five hundred firms]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Indeed, the three
largest SOEs in China]{.underline}---Sinopec, PetroChina, and National
Grid---[make more profit than the combined profits of the five hundred
largest private firms in the country]{.underline}, according to 2012
figures released by China's State-owned Assets Supervision and
Administration Commission and the National Bureau of Statistics. Yet
although some giants such as Sinopec and China Mobile pile up enormous
profits each year, as a whole China's SOEs perform poorly even with
their monopolistic advantages, gargantuan size, and the state support
and leverage that accompanies it. As a whole, China's locally managed
SOEs appear to be the most abysmal performers. According to my analysis
of multiple case studies, reinforced by other studies and estimates,
about twenty percent of all Chinese SOEs were unprofitable in 1978.
Twenty years later, in 1997, the number of unprofitable locally
controlled SEOs had doubled. And today, nearly another twenty years
later, the number of unprofitable SEOs is more than fifty percent. The
2012 World Bank report China 2030, which looks at structural problems
with the Chinese growth model, estimated that the amount of capital
input needed to produce one additional dollar of output increased from
2:1 in the 1980s, to 3:1 in the 1990s, to 4:1 early this century, and
finally, to the current estimate of 7:1. Multiple case studies have
shown that domestic private sector firms are about twice as efficient in
their use of capital, and are three times more efficient than SOEs at
generating jobs based on the amount of capital deployed per job. China's
private firms, not the state conglomerates, hold sixty-five percent of
all China's patents and are responsible for three-quarters of the
country's commercialized technological innovations. But while these
private firms bring eighty percent of all new domestic products to
market, China's capacity for wholly indigenous innovation remains
stifled as a result of domestic anti-competitive practices in favor of
SOEs, which continue to dominate the economy despite their poor
performance. One key reason for this disparity is that the typical SOE
manager is selected less for his business savvy than for political
connections and credentials. Almost all of the SOE senior managers in
the centrally managed enterprises are Communist Party members, and in
many cases the CEO and party secretary within the company is the same
person. A July 2012 report by McKinsey and Company, one of the world's
leading management consulting firms, notes that the average profit
margin of the forty-two Chinese SOEs listed among the Fortune 500's top
international companies was less than half that of their global
competitors---this after the government infused them with "massive state
subsidies." Xu Haoxun, McKinsey's China country director, believes that
without the benefit of state subsidies and protections only a handful of
these forty-two Chinese SOEs would be authentically competitive. [[But
now]{.mark}, with [China's labor]{.mark} and [production]{.mark}
[costs]{.mark} rising, the country's SOE managers are under [mounting
pressure to increase profit]{.mark} margins.]{.underline} Meeting the
five-year plan's goal to increase profitability and market
share---something Xu Haoxun believes is ["[key to the survival
of]{.mark} [Chinese enterprises]{.mark}"---**[means an increased
reliance on cyber espionage]{.mark}**, no matter the problems with the
US and the rest of the West that this initiative may cause.
**[Stealing]{.mark} information from foreign firms**, whether they are
located inside China or on foreign soil, [is]{.mark} **certainly a
[cheaper]{.mark} and [faster]{.mark} way [to remedy innovation
deficits]{.mark}** than to do the hard work of indigenous development
Chinese planners identified as a key objective]{.underline} in the 2006
"Plan for the Development." In its relentless drive to skip steps,
Beijing seems not yet to have realized---or been made to realize---that
the loss of reputation that comes with being a serial economic
rule-breaker carries considerable political and diplomatic risks, chief
among them a growing unwillingness of foreign firms to share advanced
technologies and processes with Chinese joint venture partners. [**Cyber
espionage is necessary because China has become stuck between the rock
of its lofty goals and the hard place of its modest achievement**.
Burdened by statism and the anti-competitive practices that breed its
gnawing inefficiency, China's [state-owned enterprises cannot
innovate]{.mark} [at]{.mark} the [level]{.mark} and pace [that will
produce self-sufficiency]{.mark}, much less global leader
status]{.underline}. Its private sector, which might actually rock the
cradle of innovation, is stifled by an unlevel playing field and stunted
by the legal system's failure to protect intellectual property rights
and the judiciary's refusal to robustly enforce contract law. This toxic
atmosphere is causing those foreign firms with advanced technologies and
processes to think twice about basing operations in a China whose
communist leaders are mired in zero-sum thinking that says increased
market share for foreign firms can only come at the expense of SOEs.
While China's record of genuine innovation remains poor for an economy
of its size, it continues to focus on what some experts have termed
"engineering-based" and "incremental" innovation. As Professor Dan
Breznitz of Georgia Tech puts it, [[China is **looking for a
shortcut**]{.mark} that does not require "dedication to originality and
the large commitment to . . . unique, first-time products." The [aim is
to master]{.mark} the art of [second-generation innovation]{.mark},
using established technologies to come up with new solutions, give every
support to SOEs to bring these technologies to the domestic market
before foreign firms can, and then use these foundations to expand into
global markets]{.underline}. It is what some experts such as Robert
Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation
Foundation, call "innovation mercantilism." [China's "national
champions" in the state-owned enterprises need to out-perform
international commercial rivals to grow their revenues in domestic and
foreign markets.]{.underline} Since they appear unable to do this on
their own, **[they [use data theft to win the
game]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

#### Another financial crisis sparks Chinese diversionary aggression towards the US -- causes miscalc

of International Relations at the University of Southern California and

FGY

How do we know that **[[diversionary aggression]{.mark} is a [critical
element of Chinese foreign]{.mark} [policy]{.mark}]{.underline}**?
[China's unique political economy enables us to measure just how much of
the conflict that China initiates toward the United States is
diversionary.]{.underline}

[The Chinese [regime]{.mark} is [underpinned by]{.mark} an **[autocratic
social contract]{.mark}**: In exchange for loyalty, [elites
expect]{.mark} the [regime to compensate them]{.mark}]{.underline}. In
the early 1990s, Deng Xiaoping transformed China's emerging equity
markets into a massive patronage system. To reward loyal supporters,
Deng appointed them to senior positions at state-owned enterprises about
to go public. There, they could purchase ownership shares prior to the
IPO. Because initial share prices were dramatically undervalued, this
constituted a massive arbitrage opportunity. Since the 1990s, the
Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) has served primarily to reward
elites.\[1\] To reassure them, Chinese leaders have repeatedly pledged
to protect elite investments in the stock market. In contrast, there is
virtually no connection between stock returns and public interests. In
2011, only 9 percent of Chinese households invested in the SSE.
Strikingly, the SSE has no relationship with growth, inflation, or
unemployment, and so there is no evidence that SSE shocks foster popular
discontent.

To explore the relationship between elite welfare and China's foreign
policy more systematically, I created a day-level dataset of over 3,000
bilateral interactions between the United States and China from 1990 to
2010 by coding some 10,000 pages of primary and secondary historical
materials.\[2\] Controlling for a range of features,\[3\] I find that
when the SSE declines by 5 percent to 15 percent, the Chinese government
is twice as likely to initiate disputes with the United States. This
level of volatility is extraordinarily common. It occurs in three of
every 12 months.

[Two other features of China's diversionary aggression suggest that its
**key objective is to cultivate public support**. First, it is routinely
accompanied by propaganda that broadcasts to senior government officials
just how popular the regime is: how its chief aim is to advance public
welfare]{.underline}. The People's Daily is the regime's flagship
propaganda newspaper. Its principal function is to communicate regime
doctrine to elites. When the SSE declines, the People's Daily covers
"party-mass relations" (dangqun guanxi) much more positively. The size
of the difference is equivalent to the difference in how positively Fox
News covers Democrats versus Republicans. In short, when elite interests
suffer, the regime's propaganda apparatus informs elites that it is
widely supported by the public.

Second, China reliably undertakes diplomatic charm offensives after
episodes of diversionary aggression. [For China, [diversionary
aggression is risky]{.mark}. **The [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[might mistake it for a genuine attempt to revise]{.mark} the
[power]{.mark} balance [in East Asia]{.mark} and [respond with]{.mark}
[containment policies]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Accordingly, whenever
China employs diversionary aggression, it quadruples its diplomacy the
following month. Critically, this diplomacy is virtually always private,
since Chinese citizens might view more public forms of cooperation with
the United States as capitulation to the foreign adversary so recently
demonized.

Newly released diplomatic cables provide a unique opportunity to observe
this process in action. Between January and July 2010, the SSE lost
one-third of its value. A range of evidence suggests that this crisis
profoundly shaped Chinese foreign policy towards the United States. In
March, U.S. policymakers were subjected to a "lengthy presentation" on
China's rights in the South China Sea, which were described as a
"national priority." Chinese propaganda reported that bilateral
relations were "strained" and "at a low point."

Simultaneously, the editor of the Global Times, the government's most
nationalist state-run newspaper, told U.S. Ambassador John Huntsman "not
to be concerned" because China's belligerence was "necessary to satisfy
the Chinese people." Huntsman reported to Washington that "over the
coming months, China would stomp around and carry a small stick." "This
attitude," he advised, "has more form than substance and is designed to
play to Chinese public opinion."

In July 2010, the SSE stabilized, and the economic interests of Chinese
elites recovered. China quickly backpedaled.\[4\] Chinese officials
accepted a longstanding offer for President Hu to visit Washington,
agreed to support a U.N. Security Council statement condemning North
Korea, reauthorized military exchanges with the United States, said they
had not authoritatively called the South China Sea a "core interest,"
and told US officials they were "willing to begin expert talks on a code
of conduct in the South China Sea." State Councilor Dai Bingguo even
traveled to Pyongyang on a secret mission on behalf of the United States
to warn North Korea not to respond to South Korean military exercises.

China ensured that these signals were correctly interpreted by American
policymakers. Organization Department Minister Li Yuanchao told National
Security Adviser Tom Donilon that China "would not challenge the United
States for global leadership" and that "there was no inevitable conflict
in their interests." China's private behavior during this period offers
additional clues that its aggression was diversionary rather than
revisionist. Despite headlines proclaiming that China was "incensed"
with American "containment," Beijing agreed to help with an Iran
resolution at the United Nations, on one condition: that it could keep
its assistance private.

WHY THIS MATTERS

[In attempting to secure near-dictatorial powers, **Xi has created
enemies among the Chinese elite**. **[Financial crises]{.mark}** and
political purges **[create incentives for elites to oppose Xi]{.mark}.**
Some will try to remove him. **[To inoculate himself against]{.mark}
their [conspiracies, Xi will employ diversionary foreign policy]{.mark}
even [more frequently than past]{.mark} generations of [Chinese
leaders]{.mark},** [for]{.mark} [whom such **incentives motivated 40
percent of conflict initiation** with the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates, my estimates suggest]{.underline}.

### AT: China Econ Impact

#### Chinese economic decline causes [global economic decline]{.underline}

Stephen S. **Roach 16**, senior fellow at Yale University's Jackson
Institute for Global Affairs and a senior lecturer at Yale School of
Management, formerly chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia and chief economist
at Morgan Stanley, the New York-based investment bank, holds a Ph.D. in
economics from New York University, 2016, "The world\'s economy without
Chinese growth," World Economic Forum, October 26th, Available Online at
[[https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/10/the-worlds-economy-without-chinese-growth]{.underline}](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/10/the-worlds-economy-without-chinese-growth)

So what if the China doubters are right? [What if China's economy does
indeed come crashing down]{.underline}, with its growth rate plunging
into low single digits, or even negative territory, as would be the case
in most crisis economies? China would suffer, of course, but so would an
already-shaky global economy. With all the handwringing over the Chinese
economy, it's worth considering this thought experiment in detail.

For starters, [[without China, the **world economy would already be in
recession**]{.underline}]{.mark}. China's growth rate this year appears
set to hit 6.7% -- considerably higher than most forecasters have been
expecting. According to the International Monetary Fund -- the official
arbiter of global economic metrics -- [the Chinese economy accounts for
17.3% of world GDP]{.underline} (measured on a purchasing-power-parity
basis). [A 6.7% increase in Chinese real GDP thus translates into about
1.2 percentage points of world growth. [Absent China]{.mark}, that
contribution would need to be subtracted from the [IMF's]{.mark}
downwardly revised 3.1% [estimate for world GDP growth]{.mark} in 2016,
dragging it [down to 1.9%]{.mark} -- well [below the]{.mark} 2.5%
[threshold]{.mark} commonly [associated with global
recessions]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Of course, that's just the direct effect of a world without China. Then
[[there are cross-border linkages with other major
economies]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The so-called [resource economies -- namely, Australia, New Zealand,
Canada, Russia, and Brazil -- would be hit especially hard]{.underline}.
As a resource-intensive growth juggernaut, China has transformed these
economies, which collectively account for nearly 9% of world GDP. While
all of them argue that they have diversified economic structures that
are not overly dependent on Chinese commodity demand, currency markets
say otherwise: [[whenever China's growth expectations are
revised]{.mark} -- upward or downward -- [their exchange rates move in
tandem]{.mark}]{.underline}. The IMF currently projects that these five
economies will contract by a combined 0.7% in 2016, reflecting ongoing
recessions in Russia and Brazil and modest growth in the other three.
Needless to say, [in a China implosion scenario, this baseline estimate
would be revised downward significantly.]{.underline}

[The same would be the case for China's Asian trading partners -- most
of which remain export-dependent economies, with the Chinese market
their largest source of external demand]{.underline}. [That is
true]{.underline} not only [of]{.underline} smaller Asian developing
economies such as Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand, but also of
the larger and more developed economies in the region, such as [Japan,
Korea, and Taiwan]{.underline}. Collectively, these six China-dependent
Asian economies make up another 11% of world GDP. [A China implosion
could easily knock at least one percentage point off their combined
growth rate.]{.underline}

The United States is also a case in point. [China is America's
third-largest and most rapidly growing export market. In a
China-implosion scenario, that export demand would all but dry up --
knocking approximately 0.2-0.3 percentage points off already subpar US
economic growth of around 1.6% in 2016.]{.underline}

Finally, there is Europe to consider. Growth in Germany, long the engine
of an otherwise sclerotic Continental economy, remains heavily dependent
on exports. That is due increasingly to the importance of China -- now
Germany's third-largest export market, after the European Union and the
United States. In a China implosion scenario, German economic growth
could also be significantly lower, dragging down the rest of a
German-led Europe.

Interestingly, in its just-released October update of the World Economic
Outlook, [the IMF devotes an entire chapter to what it calls a China
spillover analysis -- a model-based assessment of the global impacts of
a China slowdown]{.underline}. Consistent with the arguments above, [the
IMF focuses on linkages to commodity exporters, Asian exporters, and
what they call "systemic advanced economies"]{.underline} (Germany,
Japan, and the US) [that would be most exposed to a Chinese
downturn]{.underline}. By their reckoning, [[the impact on Asia would be
the largest]{.mark}, followed closely by the resource economies; the
sensitivity of the three developed economies is estimated to be about
half that of China's non-Japan Asian trading partners]{.underline}.

about another 25% to the direct effects of China's growth

growth vanished]{.mark} into thin air]{.underline}, in accordance with
our thought experiment, [the sum of the direct effects]{.underline} (1.2
percentage points of global growth) and indirect spillovers (roughly
another 0.3 percentage points) [would essentially halve the current
baseline estimate of 2016 global growth]{.underline}, from 3.1% to 1.6%.

[After years of public reporting on the theft of intellectual
property]{.underline}, [business strategies, and trade
secrets]{.underline}, last month [the cybersecurity firm FireEye issued
a report headlining a steep decline in Chinese cyber
espionage]{.underline} against organizations in the US and 25 other
countries. The number of network compromises by 72 suspected China-based
groups dropped from 60 in February 2013 to less than 10 by May 2016.
While FireEye did not rule out the possibility that improvements in
tradecraft were leading to less detection (FBI Director James Comey once
compared Chinese hackers to drunk burglars who kick in the door and
knock over a vase on their way out with the TV), US [Assistant Attorney
General John]{.underline} [Carlin confirmed the company's findings that
attacks were less voluminous but more focused and calculated. A
combination of the threat of US sanctions]{.underline}, [a diplomatic
accord]{.underline} signed by President Barack Obama and President Xi
Jinping, [and]{.underline} [internal reforms of the
P]{.underline}eople's [L]{.underline}iberation [A]{.underline}rmy [may

espionage]{.underline}, [but is it time]{.underline} [to]{.underline}
shut down the firewall, send the threat intelligence analysts home, and
[declare victory? **Very unlikely**.]{.underline} **[For Beijing,
cyberspace is essential to economic growth]{.underline}**, [sustaining
and strengthening the Chinese Communist Party]{.underline}, [and
maintaining domestic stability and national security]{.underline}. As a
result, [China hacks because it wants to move its economy from labor
intensive manufacturing to high technology innovation]{.underline};
[defeat foreign ideologies and weaken opponents of the
regime]{.underline}; and counter the technological advantages of the US
military in the Pacific. These fundamental motivations direct
state-backed hackers to a set of high value targets. **[Because Chinese
leaders do not want to be dependent on foreign technology
suppliers]{.underline}**, [and are impatient with the results produced
so far by]{.underline} massive [investments in education

#### It sparks [global instability]{.underline} that goes [nuclear]{.underline}

The Challenge: Multiple Existential Threats

The relationship between pandemics and war is as long as human history.
[Past [pandemics]{.mark} have]{.underline} [**set the scene** for wars
by **[weaken]{.mark}**ing [societies]{.mark}, undermining resilience,
[and **exacerbat**]{.mark}ing civil and [inter-state
conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}. Other disease outbreaks have erupted
during wars, in part due to the appalling public health and battlefield
conditions resulting from war, in turn sowing the seeds for new
conflicts. In the post-Cold War era, [pandemics]{.underline} have
[[spread with **unprecedented speed** due to]{.mark} **increased
[mobility]{.mark}** created [by globalization]{.mark}]{.underline},
especially between urbanized areas. Although there are positive signs
that scientific advances and rapid innovation can help us manage
pandemics, [[it is **likely**]{.mark} that deadly infectious [viruses
will be a challenge for **years to come**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The COVID-19 is the most demonic pandemic threat in modern history. It
has erupted at a juncture of other existential global threats, most
importantly, accelerating climate change and resurgent nuclear
threat-making. The most important issue, therefore, is how the
coronavirus (and future pandemics) will increase or decrease the risks
associated with these twin threats, climate change effects, and the next
use of nuclear weapons in war.5

Today, the nine [nuclear weapons]{.underline} arsenals not only
[can]{.underline} annihilate hundreds of cities, but also [cause
**nuclear winter** and **mass starvation** of]{.underline} a billion or
more people, if not [the **entire human species**]{.underline}.
Concurrently, climate change is enveloping the planet with more frequent
and intense storms, accelerating sea level rise, and advancing rapid
ecological change, expressed in unprecedented forest fires across the
world. Already stretched to a breaking point in many countries, the
current pandemic may overcome resilience to the point of near or actual
collapse of social, economic, and political order.

In this extraordinary moment, it is timely to reflect on the existence
and possible uses of weapons of mass destruction under pandemic
conditions -- most importantly, nuclear weapons, but also chemical and
biological weapons. [[Moments of]{.mark} **extreme
[crisis]{.mark}**]{.underline} and vulnerability [can [prompt]{.mark}
**aggressive**]{.underline} and counterintuitive [[**actions**
that]{.mark} in turn may **[destabilize]{.mark}** already
**[precarious]{.mark}**ly balanced threat [systems]{.mark}, underpinned
by **conventional** and **nuclear** weapons, as well as the threat of
**weaponized** **chemical** and **biological**
technologies.]{.underline} [Consequently, the [risk of]{.mark} the [use
of]{.mark}]{.underline} weapons of mass destruction
[[(WMD)]{.mark},]{.underline} especially nuclear weapons,
**[[increases]{.underline}]{.mark}** at such times, possibly
**[[sharply]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

The COVID-19 pandemic is clearly driving massive, rapid, and
unpredictable changes that will redefine every aspect of the human
condition, including WMD -- just as the world wars of the first half of
the 20th century led to a revolution in international affairs and
entirely new ways of organizing societies, economies, and international
relations, in part based on nuclear weapons and their threatened use. In
a world reshaped by pandemics, nuclear weapons -- as well as correlated
non-nuclear WMD, nuclear alliances, "deterrence" doctrines, operational
and declaratory policies, nuclear extended deterrence, organizational
practices, and the existential risks posed by retaining these
capabilities -- are all up for redefinition.

[[A pandemic]{.mark} has potential to [destabilize a
**nuclear**]{.mark}**-prone [conflict]{.mark}** by
[incapacitating]{.mark}]{.underline} the supreme nuclear commander or
[[commanders]{.mark} who have to issue nuclear strike orders, creating
uncertainty as to who is in charge, how to handle nuclear mistakes (such
a]{.underline}s errors, **[accidents]{.underline}**, technological
failures, and entanglement with conventional operations gone awry),
[[and opening]{.mark} a]{.underline} brief [[**opportunity** for]{.mark}
a **[first strike]{.mark}**]{.underline} at a time when the
COVID-infected state may not be able to retaliate efficiently -- or at
all -- due to leadership confusion. In some nuclear-laden conflicts, [a
state might use a pandemic as a **cover** for]{.underline} political or
[military provocations]{.underline} in the belief that the adversary is
distracted and partly disabled by the pandemic, increasing the risk of
war in a nuclear-prone conflict. At the same time, [a pandemic may lead
nuclear armed states to increase]{.underline} the [isolation and
sanctions against a]{.underline} nuclear [adversary]{.underline}, making
it even harder to stop the spread of the disease, in turn creating a
pandemic reservoir and transmission risk back to the nuclear armed state
or its allies.

[In principle, the common threat]{.underline} of the pandemic [might
induce nuclear]{.underline}-armed [states to reduce]{.underline} the
[tension]{.underline} in a nuclear-prone conflict and thereby the risk
of nuclear war. It may cause nuclear adversaries or their umbrella
states to seek to resolve conflicts in a cooperative and collaborative
manner by creating habits of communication, engagement, and mutual
learning that come into play in the nuclear-military sphere. For
example, militaries may cooperate to control pandemic transmission,
including by working together against criminal-terrorist non-state
actors that are trafficking people or by joining forces to ensure that a
new pathogen is not developed as a bioweapon.

[To date, however, the]{.underline} COVID-19 [pandemic has
increased]{.underline} the [isolation]{.underline} of some nuclear-armed
states [and provided a textbook case of the failure]{.underline} of
states [to cooperate]{.underline} to overcome the pandemic.
**[[Borders]{.underline}]{.mark}** have [**[slam]{.mark}med shut**,
**[trade shut down]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [and **budgets blown
out**]{.underline}, creating enormous pressure to focus on immediate
domestic priorities. [Foreign [policies]{.mark} have [become]{.mark}
markedly more **[nationalistic]{.mark}**. Dependence on nuclear weapons
may increase as states seek to buttress a global
re-spatialization]{.underline}6 [of all dimensions of human interaction
at all levels to manage pandemics.]{.underline} The effect of nuclear
threats on leaders may make it less likely -- or even impossible -- to
achieve the kind of concert at a global level needed to respond to and
administer an effective vaccine, making it harder and even impossible to
revert to pre-pandemic international relations. [The [result is]{.mark}
that]{.underline} some [[states]{.mark} may
[proliferate]{.mark}]{.underline} their own [nuclear
weapons]{.underline}, further [[reinforcing]{.mark} the [spiral of
conflicts]{.mark}]{.underline} contained by nuclear threat, [[with
**cascading effects** on]{.mark} the risk of **[nuclear
war]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

### 2NC\-\--Impact\-\--Pandemics

#### Disruptive [pharma innovation]{.underline} solves [pandemics]{.underline}.

Affan **Shaikh, 15** (Affan Shaikh, Professor at School of Public Health
at Emory, 9-23-2015, accessed on 7-20-2022, National Center for
Biotechnology Innovation, "[[Disruptive Innovation]{.underline}]{.mark}

[Public health surveillance ([PHS]{.mark}) is [at a tipping
point]{.mark}, where the application of [novel processes]{.mark},
technologies, and tools promise to [vastly improve]{.mark} efficiency
and [effectiveness]{.mark}. Yet twentieth century, entrenched ideology
and lack of training results in slow uptake and resistance to
change]{.underline}. The term **[disruptive innovation]{.underline}** --
[used to describe **advances** in **tech**]{.underline}nology [and
processes that change existing markets]{.underline} [-- is useful to
describe the transformation of PHS. Past disruptive innovations used in
PHS, such as distance learning, the smart phone, and field-based
laboratory testing have outpaced older services, practices, and
technologies used in the traditional classroom, governmental offices,
and personal communication, respectively]{.underline}. Arguably, the
greatest of these is the Internet -- an infrastructural innovation that
continues to enable exponential benefits in seemingly limitless ways.
Considering the Global Health Security Agenda and facing emerging and
reemerging infectious disease threats, evolving environmental and
behavioral risks, and ever changing epidemiologic trends, PHS must
transform[. Embracing [disruptive innovation in]{.mark} the structures
and processes of [PHS]{.mark} can be unpredictable. However, it [is
**necessary to**]{.mark} **strengthen and unlock the potential to
[prevent]{.mark}, [detect]{.mark}, [and respond]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

Fifty-two years ago, Alexander Langmuir articulated our modern
understanding of public health surveillance (PHS) -- the systematic
collection, consolidation and evaluation, and dissemination of data (1).
In this workflow process, public health provides epidemiologic
intelligence to assess and track conditions of public health importance,
define public health priorities, evaluate programs, and conduct public
health research (2). [However, [amid]{.mark} this [rapidly changing
world]{.mark}, [PHS]{.mark} has [remained sluggish]{.mark} and hindered
by the impediments of siloed, vertical]{.underline} (outcome-specific)
systems, inadequate training and technical expertise, different
information and communication technology (ICT) standards, concerns over
data sharing and confidentiality, poor interoperability, and inadequate
analytical approaches and tools (3--7).

[[Gaps]{.mark} and impediments [in PHS]{.mark} have [become increasingly
evident]{.mark} to the world in the wake of the largest Ebola epidemic
ever -- in which these challenges impacted our ability to prevent,
detect, and respond]{.underline}. Under the looming threat of MERS-CoV,
leishmaniasis, influenza, multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, and
plague[**, the global public health community now realizes the urgent
need to address shortcomings in PHS.** [Properly preparing for]{.mark}
the [next]{.mark} major [outbreak hinges on]{.mark} our willingness to
transform; the consequences of not doing so are dire.]{.underline}

**[[Transforming PHS to]{.mark} meet the [needs]{.mark} [of]{.mark} the
[twenty-first century]{.mark} requires novel approaches]{.underline}**.
A helpful concept to understand and chart this future is [[disruptive
innovation]{.underline}]{.mark} -- a term first introduced by Clayton
Christensen to describe [innovations in technology and processes that
disrupt existing markets]{.underline} (8). [Disruptive innovations occur
when advances in technologies or processes create markets in existing
industries. This [differs from sustaining innovations]{.mark},
[where]{.mark} existing [practices]{.mark} are [incrementally
improved]{.mark} to meet the demands of existing customers; in contrast,
newly introduced innovations with [disruptive]{.mark} potential
(typically unrefined, simple, and affordable in character) target
lower-end market needs or [create entirely new market
segments]{.mark}]{.underline}. As sustaining innovations improve
[[disrupting tech]{.mark}nologies or processes]{.underline}, **[these
new innovations [will meet]{.mark} increasingly [greater needs]{.mark},
capture [greater market share]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} eventually [reshape
the industry]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Christensen uses the example of
increasingly smaller disk sizes in the hard disk drive industry, the
introduction of hydraulic technology in the mechanical excavator
industry, and the rise of minimills in the steel industry to demonstrate
the impact of disruptive innovations (8[). Here, we describe the need
for disruptive innovation in PHS and identify opportunities for
disruption in PHS structures and processes]{.underline}.

[The COVID-19]{.underline} pandemic [may be the deadliest [viral
outbreak]{.mark} the world has seen in more than a century. But
statistically, such **extreme events [aren't]{.mark} as [rare]{.mark} as
we may think**, asserts a [new analysis]{.mark} of novel disease
outbreaks [over]{.mark} the past **[400 years]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

The study, appearing in the Proceedings of the National Academy of
Sciences the week of Aug. 23, used a newly assembled record of past
outbreaks to estimate the intensity of those events and the yearly
probability of them recurring.

[It found the probability of a pandemic with similar impact to COVID-19
is about 2% in any year, meaning that someone born in the year 2000
would have about a 38% chance of experiencing one by now.]{.underline}
**[And that probability is only growing]{.underline}**, [which the
authors say [highlights the need to adjust perceptions of]{.mark}
pandemic [**risks** and]{.mark} expectations for
**[preparedness]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

"[The most important takeaway is that **large pandemics**]{.underline}
like **[[COVID]{.underline}]{.mark}**-19 and the Spanish flu **[are
relatively []{.mark}likely,"]{.underline}** [said William Pan, Ph.D.,
associate professor of global environmental health at Duke and one of
the paper's co-authors]{.underline}. [**Understanding that pandemics
aren't so rare** [should **raise**]{.mark} the [**priority** of efforts
to **prevent** and **control**]{.mark} them **in the future, he
said.**]{.underline}

[The study, led by Marco Marani, Ph.D., of the University of Padua in
Italy, used **[new statistical methods]{.mark}** to [measure the scale
and frequency of]{.mark} disease [outbreaks]{.mark} for which there was
no immediate medical intervention over the past four
centuries]{.underline}. Their analysis, which covered a murderer's row
of pathogens including plague, smallpox, cholera, typhus and novel
influenza viruses, found considerable variability in the rate at which
pandemics have occurred in the past. [But they also identified patterns
that allowed them to describe the probabilities of similar-scale events
happening again.]{.underline}

In the case of the deadliest pandemic in modern history -- the Spanish
flu, which killed more than 30 million people between 1918 and 1920 \--
the probability of a pandemic of similar magnitude occurring ranged from
0.3% to 1.9% per year over the time period studied. Taken another way,
those figures mean it is statistically likely that a pandemic of such
extreme scale would occur within the next 400 years.

" The most important takeaway is that large pandemics like COVID-19 and
the Spanish flu are relatively likely. WILLIAM PAN --- ASSOCIATE
PROFESSOR OF GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH

In the case of the deadliest pandemic in modern history -- the Spanish
flu, which killed more than 30 million people between 1918 and 1920 \--
the probability of a pandemic of similar magnitude occurring ranged from
0.3% to 1.9% per year over the time period studied. Taken another way,
those figures mean it is statistically likely that a pandemic of such
extreme scale would occur within the next 400 years.

But the data also show [**the [risk of intense outbreaks is growing
rapidly]{.mark}**. Based on the increasing rate at which novel pathogens
such as SARS-CoV-2 have broken loose in human populations in the past 50
years, the study estimates that [the probability]{.mark} of novel
disease outbreaks **[will]{.mark} likely [grow three-fold]{.mark} in the
next few decades.**]{.underline}

Using this increased risk factor, the researchers estimate that a
pandemic similar in scale to COVID-19 is likely within a span of 59
years, a result they write is "much lower than intuitively expected."
Although not included in the PNAS paper[, they also calculated the
[probability of]{.mark} a pandemic capable of **[eliminating]{.mark}**
all **[human life]{.mark}**, finding it **[statistically
likely]{.mark}**]{.underline} within the next 12,000 years.

[That is not to say we can count on a 59-year reprieve from a COVID-like
pandemic, nor that we're off the hook for a calamity on the scale of the
Spanish flu for another 300 years]{.underline}. **[Such [events
are]{.mark} equally [probable in any year]{.mark} during the
span]{.underline}**, said Gabriel Katul, Ph.D., the Theodore S. Coile
Distinguished Professor of Hydrology and Micrometeorology at Duke and
another of the paper's authors.

["When a 100-year flood occurs today, one may erroneously presume that
one can afford to wait another 100 years before experiencing another
such event]{.underline}," Katul says. "[This impression is false. One
can get another 100-year flood the next year."]{.underline}

As an environmental health scientist, [Pan can speculate on the reasons
[outbreaks]{.mark} are [becoming more frequent]{.mark}, noting that
population **[growth]{.mark}**, changes **[in]{.mark}** food
**[systems]{.mark}**, environmental degradation [and]{.mark} more
[**frequent contact**]{.mark} between humans and disease-harboring
animals all may be significant factors]{.underline}. He emphasizes the
statistical analysis sought only to characterize the risks, not to
explain what is driving them.

[But at the same time, he hopes the study will spark deeper exploration
of the factors that may be making devastating pandemics more likely --
and how to counteract them]{.underline}.

**["This points to the [importance of early response]{.mark} to disease
outbreaks [and building capacity for pandemic]{.mark}
[surveillance]{.mark} at the local and global scales, as well as for
[setting a research agenda for]{.mark} understanding why large
[outbreaks]{.mark} are becoming more common]{.underline}**," Pan said.

#### It's [independently]{.underline} key to [BioMed research]{.underline}.

In this paper we have tried to inform scientists at academic
institutions about the most important aspects of IP. In our experience,
many scientists do not place much emphasis on securing the IP rights on
an invention, or are unfamiliar with the process, which prompted us to
write this paper. The underlying thought process, however, is
essentially simple and applies to most situations in translational and
clinical research. [The [chances]{.mark} that an [invention will]{.mark}
ultimately [reach]{.mark} the target user are strikingly slim
[without]{.mark} valid [IP protection]{.mark} on the invention. The low
probability of a non-patented product reaching the market is [due to
the]{.mark} magnitude of the [costs]{.mark} associated [with]{.mark} the
[development and implementation]{.mark} trajectory, which is basically
unavoidable for most inventions.]{.underline} Importantly, these costs
are typically too high to be fully covered by the majority of public
research funding agencies. We have had a patent agency perform a cost
estimate for the technology referenced in \[9\], which yielded an
estimate of total costs of approximately 15 million Euros. Even the
largest consortium grants from Brussels could not entirely cover these
costs.

[Securing an [IP]{.mark} position on an invention [opens]{.mark}
numerous [avenues that could]{.mark} financially [facilitate]{.mark} the
development and launch of a [new product]{.mark} or service. The
exclusivity and safeguards of a strong IP position automatically
[create]{.mark} a win-win situation around a [viable and sustainable
business model]{.mark} for all parties involved.]{.underline} For
example, [angel [investors]{.mark} and venture capitalists
[demand]{.mark} return on investment ([ROI]{.mark}) for their infusion
of high-risk capital backing, which scientists need to develop their
invention. [IP]{.mark} largely secures ROI because it [allows companies
to block]{.mark} direct [competitors and]{.mark} thus obtain and [retain
an exclusive market share]{.mark} for the lifetime of the patent, once
the product has passed the preclinical and clinical trial phases and has
obtained marketing approval from the regulatory agencies]{.underline}
(e.g. FDA/EMA). [The same need for a solid IP position applies to
companies interested in licensing the invention. [Companies]{.mark}
depend on significant revenue streams over longer periods to cover the
costs of product development and to make a profit, and hence generally
[do not invest in products not protected by IP]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Researchers should realize that the main reason for securing IP rights
is to increase the chance that their invention is developed into a
product, and also that only very few patents lead to significant
revenues.

In the final analysis, [if clinical and translational researchers want
their invention to help patients, they should opt for securing IP rights
on their invention]{.underline}. In our opinion and experience, the
(potential) benefits, as summarized in this paper, clearly outweigh the
(potential) cons. Moreover, [the path to eventual clinical application
is not a solo adventure. Luckily, ample infrastructure and support in
the form of KTOs is present in most academic institutions to help
researchers with matters for which they have no expertise.]{.underline}

Since its introduction by Joseph Nye, Jr., in 1990, soft power has been
defined as "achieving desirable influence through attraction and
cooperation," as opposed to hard power, which rests on inducements or
threats.1 Although the concept of soft power is not universally
embraced,2 [using]{.underline} economic, cultural,
**[[scientific]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[and **healthcare
resources**]{.underline}]{.mark} [can [create **a dominant soft power**
that]{.mark}]{.underline}, when carefully applied, [[might
generate]{.underline} **[favorable behavior]{.underline}** [from other
nations and]{.underline} [their]{.underline} [leaders and
build]{.underline} **[enduring partnerships]{.underline}** [to promote
**regional and global security**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [The]{.underline}
[[healthcare sector]{.underline}]{.mark} is a diverse group of
industries accounting for \$2.8 trillion, or 17.8 percent, of the U.S.
gross domestic product.3 It [[delivers]{.mark} direct]{.underline}
health [care through]{.underline} thousands of hospitals and other
facilities and [[provides]{.underline} **[research and
development]{.underline}** [for]{.underline}]{.mark} manufacturing
**[[pharmaceuticals]{.underline}]{.mark}**, medical devices, [[and
**biotechnology**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [It is **a research-intensive
segment of the economy**]{.underline} focusing on developing better
methods for preventing, diagnosing, and treating life-threatening
diseases, and it provides stability and prosperity in the form of
millions of high paying jobs. [[It can]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[play
**a pivotal role**]{.underline} [in a U.S. asymmetric response to
**unpredictable challenges**]{.underline}]{.mark} overseas, both
directly through the care of patients and more generally in the economic
benefits of expanding the healthcare sector in countries where
unemployment and unfavorable socioeconomic factors contribute to
radicalism. Physicians are well regarded in many cultures, especially in
the Arab and Muslim world. [U.S. policy [strategists
can]{.mark}]{.underline} leverage this historic goodwill and [[use **the
diplomacy of medicine**]{.underline} [to reach out]{.underline}]{.mark}
to Arab and Muslim countries, [especially those undergoing]{.underline}
Arab Spring [transitions including Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Yemen, and
even Syria]{.underline}. For countries such as Iraq that have shattered
healthcare infrastructures, **[healthcare
[cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[represents a unique opportunity to

Kim Jong Un marked a decade as supreme leader of North Korea in
December. [[Whether]{.underline}]{.mark} he \[[[Kim]{.mark} Jong
Un]{.underline}\] [can **[hold]{.mark} on** to
**[power]{.mark}**]{.underline} for another 10 years [may
[depend]{.mark} [on]{.mark} **state hackers**]{.underline}, [whose
**[cybercrimes]{.mark}** **finance**]{.underline} his [nuclear arms
program and **[prop up]{.mark}** the **[economy]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
According to the U.S. Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency,
[[No]{.mark}rth [Ko]{.mark}rea's state-backed]{.underline} "malicious
[cyberactivities]{.underline}" target banks around the world, steal
defense secrets, **[extort money]{.underline}** through ransomware,
hijack digitally mined currency, and launder ill-gotten gains through
cryptocurrency exchanges. [Kim's regime has [already]{.mark}
[taken]{.mark} in as much **as [\$2.3 billion]{.mark}** through
cybercrimes and is [geared]{.mark} [to rake]{.mark} in **even
[more]{.mark}**]{.underline}, U.S. and United Nations investigators have
said. The [[cybercrimes]{.mark} have [provide]{.mark}d a
**[lifeline]{.mark}** [for]{.mark} the **struggling**
**[No]{.mark}**]{.underline}rth **[[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}**rean
**[[economy]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which has been hobbled by sanctions.
Kim has shown little interest in returning to negotiations that could
lead to a lifting of sanctions if North Korea winds down its nuclear
arms program. [[Money]{.mark} [from]{.mark} [cybercrimes]{.mark}
represents about **[8%]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} [No]{.mark}]{.underline}rth
[[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}rea[['s]{.mark}]{.underline} estimated
[[econ]{.mark}omy]{.underline} in 2020, which is smaller than when Kim
took power, according to the Bank of Korea in Seoul. (The bank for years
has provided the best available accounting on the economic activity of
the secretive state.) Kim's decision to shut borders because of Covid-19
suspended the little legal trade North Korea had and helped send the
economy into its biggest contraction in more than two decades. Kim's
regime has two means of evading global sanctions, which were imposed to
punish it for nuclear and ballistic missile tests. One is the
ship-to-ship transfer of commodities such as coal: A North Korean vessel
will shift its cargo to another vessel, or the other way around, and
both vessels typically try to cloak their identity. The other is the
cyberarmy. Its documented [cybercrimes include attempts to steal \$2
billion from the Swift]{.underline} (Society for Worldwide Interbank
Financial Telecommunication) system of financial transactions. North
Korea has also illegally accessed military technology that could be used
for financial gain, according to a UN Security Council panel charged
with investigating sanctions-dodging by the government. North Korea "is
not afraid to be brazen and destructive in order to achieve the task at
hand," says Jenny Jun, a nonresident fellow at the Atlantic Council's
Cyber Statecraft Initiative, who's researched North Korea's
cyberoperations and cyberstrategies. "And this sets it apart from some
of the other, more careful---and therefore more
restrained---nation-state hackers." The [government has deployed
**malware**]{.underline} called AppleJeus [that poses as a
crypto]{.underline}currency [trading platform to **steal
funds**]{.underline} from people who try to use it. Since 2018 various
versions of the malware have been used to target more than 30 countries.
From 2019 to November 2020, AppleJeus [hackers stole virtual assets
valued at **\$316.4 million**]{.underline}, according to UN and U.S.
investigators. By comparison, North Korea's coal exports are capped at
\$400 million a year under global sanctions. [Targets of the regime
include **central banks**]{.underline}, the militaries of the world's
most powerful countries, [and corner **ATMs**]{.underline}. It even
tried to hack Pfizer Inc. for Covid vaccine data. South Korea said
[[hacking]{.mark} attempts]{.underline} directed at it by its neighbor
[**[increased]{.mark}** about **[9%]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the first
half of 2021 from the second half of 2020.

Then the coronavirus [pandemic made things **far worse** for
No]{.underline}rth [Ko]{.underline}rea's [economy]{.underline}. Kim's
decision to seal the country's borders has resulted in economic pain
Washington could never have achieved through sanctions. Recent reports
suggest growing alarm among North Korea's leadership over failed
economic programs, with attendant electrical outages, factory closures,
and shortages of some food staples. Foreign diplomats have left North
Korea over the difficult living conditions and shortages of medicine and
basic goods in Pyongyang. It is [**little surprise** that
[No]{.mark}]{.underline}rth [[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}rea [is
**[increasingly reliant]{.mark}** [on cyber attacks]{.mark}]{.underline}
and cryptocurrency theft [[to]{.mark} **[generate]{.mark}
[revenue]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

NORTH KOREA'S WMD BAZAAR

North Korea's desperation could make a sustained U.S. pressure strategy
still riskier. Kim's regime remains remarkably resilient, so collapse
seems unlikely---even though U.S. officials would be wise to prepare for
that unique scenario. [The [most likely]{.mark} **[outgrowth]{.mark}**
of [No]{.mark}rth [Ko]{.mark}rea's **[need for cash]{.mark}** is an
[increase]{.mark} in [other **dangerous**]{.mark}
**[behavior]{.mark}**]{.underline}. WMD technology represents one of
North Korea's few value-added assets.

[[No]{.underline}]{.mark}rth [[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}rea's

**[long]{.mark}**]{.underline}: [**[missile]{.mark}** [and]{.mark}
**[nuc]{.mark}lear [trade]{.mark}** [with

**[Egypt]{.mark}**]{.underline}, **[[Libya]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
**[[Yemen]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and others; chemical weapons
assistance to Syria; and more. Notably, [No]{.underline}rth
[Ko]{.underline}rea clandestinely [sought to construct a **nuclear
reactor** in **[Syria]{.mark}**]{.underline}, a [facility that might
have provided **plutonium** for a **Syrian bomb** program]{.underline}
until Israel destroyed the partly built reactor with air strikes in
2007. The March 2021 report by the UN Panel of Experts reported ongoing
assistance by North Korea with Iran's ballistic missile and space launch
programs. Iranian scientists reportedly went to North Korea to discuss
rocket booster technology, while thirteen North Korean experts are
believed to have visited Iran to assist with liquid-fueled ballistic
missiles. According to the report, the cooperation between North Korean
and Iranian entities also extends to illicit shipments of valves,
electronics, and other missile-related equipment.

Until now, apart from the reactor project in Syria,
[[No]{.underline}]{.mark}rth [[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}rea [is [**not

themselves]{.underline}. Presumably, [North Korean leaders]{.underline}
historically [have believed that such transfers could cross
a]{.underline}n implicit [red line and result in harsher

willing to **[risk sales]{.mark}** of these items
[to]{.mark}]{.underline} interested customers in **[[the

[[including]{.underline}]{.mark} possibly

[If such sales come to light]{.underline}, it is reasonable to expect
that [[Israel would]{.underline}]{.mark} again [[take **preemptive

Fakhrizadeh, in November 2020 [and]{.underline} of [causing an
**explosion** that **damaged** the **power supply** to Iran's Natanz
**uranium enrichment facility**]{.underline} in April 2021.

PRIORITIZE ENDING NORTH KOREAN NUCLEAR SALES

[Relying on Israeli counterprolif]{.underline}eration strikes [to

**[entire spectrum of nuclear conflict]{.underline}** possibilities,
ranging from a. nuclear attack upon a nonnuclear state to systemwide
nuclear war. How might such far-reaching consequences of nuclear
terrorism come about? Perhaps [the]{.underline} **[most likely
way]{.underline}** [would involve a terrorist nuclear assault against a
state by terrorists]{.underline} [**\"hosted\"** in **a**nother
**state**]{.underline}. For example, consider the following scenario:

> Early in the 1980s, Israel and her Arab state neighbors finally stand
> ready to conclude a comprehensive, multilateral peace settlement. With
> a bilateral treaty between Israel and Egypt already several years old,
> only the interests of the Palestinians---as defined by the PLO--- seem

> **[initiates]{.underline}** selected
> **[[strikes]{.underline}]{.mark}** [against]{.underline} **[[terrorist

> [have suffered]{.underline} **[unprecedented
> destruction]{.underline}**.

Of course, [such a scenario is **fraught** with the]{.underline}
**[makings of]{.underline}** even [**wider destruction**. How would
the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
**[react]{.underline}** to the situation in the Middle
East**[?]{.underline}** What would be the Soviet response? It is
certainly conceivable that [a [**chain reaction** of **interstate
nuc**]{.mark}**lear [conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[could
ensue]{.underline}]{.mark}, one [[that]{.mark} would]{.underline}
ultimately [[involve]{.underline}]{.mark} the
**[superpowers]{.underline}** [or]{.underline} even **[[every
nuclear]{.mark} weapon [state]{.mark} on the planet]{.underline}**.

What, exactly, would this mean? Whether the terms of assessment be
statistical or human, the consequences of nuclear war require an
entirely new paradigm of death. Only such a paradigm would allow us a
proper framework for absorbing the vision of near-total obliteration and
the outer limits of human destructiveness. [Any nuclear war would
have]{.underline} effectively **[permanent and irreversible
consequences]{.underline}**. Whatever the actual extent of injuries and
fatalities, [it [would]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[entomb]{.underline}**]{.mark} the spirit of [**the [entire
species]{.mark}** in a]{.underline} **[planetary casket]{.underline}**
strewn with shorn bodies and imbecile imaginations.

This would be **[as true]{.underline}** [for a]{.underline}
**[\"limited\"]{.underline}** nuclear [war as]{.underline} for
[an]{.underline} **[\"unlimited\"]{.underline}** [one]{.underline}.
Contrary to continuing Pentagon commitments to the idea of selected
\"counterforce\" strikes that would reduce the chances for escalation
and produce fewer civilian casualties, the strategy of limited nuclear
war is inherently unreasonable. There is, in fact, no clear picture of
what states might hope to gain from counterforce attacks. This
understanding is reflected by Soviet military strategy, which is founded
on the idea that any nuclear conflict would necessarily be unlimited.

Nuclear War Between the Superpowers

The consequences of a strategic exchange between the United States and
the Soviet Union have been the object of widespread attention. One
account of these consequences is offered by Andrei D. Sakharov, the
brilliant physicist who played a leading role in the development of
Russia\'s thermonuclear capacity:

> A complete destruction of cities, industry, transport, and systems of
> education, a poisoning of fields, water, and air by radioactivity, a
> physical destruction of the larger part of mankind, poverty,
> barbarism, a return to savagery, and a genetic degeneracy of the
> survivors under the impact of radiation, a destruction of the material
> and information basis of civilization---this is a measure of the peril
> that threatens the world as a result of the estrangement of the
> world\'s two superpowers. 13

Presently, U.S. strategic arsenals contain approximately 9,000 strategic
weapons and 4,000 megaton equivalents. Soviet strategic forces number
approximately 3,000 weapons and about 5,000 megaton equivalents.14 An
exchange involving any substantial fraction of these forces could
promptly destroy more than half of the urban populations in both
countries. The subsequent fallout could be expected to kill upwards of
50 percent of the surviving rural inhabitants as well as create
worldwide contamination of the atmosphere.15

To better understand the effects of fallout, it is useful to recognize
that radiation effects have three basic forms: (1) radiation directly
from the explosion; (2) immediate radioactive fallout (first twenty-four
hours); and (3) long-term fallout (months and years). In areas where
radioactive fallout is of particularly high intensity, individuals will
be exposed to high doses of radiation regardless of shelter protection.
Those who do not become prompt or short-term fatalities and have
suffered radiation exposures above 100 REMs will undergo hemo tological
(blood system) alterations that diminish immunological capabilities. The
resultant vulnerability to infection will seriously impair prospects for
long-term recovery.

The effects of a nuclear war between the superpowers, however, cannot be
understood solely in terms of projected casualties. Rather, these
effects must also include quantitative effects (i.e., availability of
productive capacity, fuel, labor, food, and other resources);
qualitative effects (i.e., political, social, and psychological damage);
and interactive effects (i.e., the impact on the relationships between
the social and economic factors of production).17 When these corollary
effects are taken into account, it is easy to see that policy makers and
public alike have typically understated the aggregate impact of nuclear
war.

This point is supported by a 1975 study of the National Research
Council, National Academy of Sciences, entitled Long- Term Worldwide
Effects of Multiple Nuclear Weapons Detonations. Going beyond the usual
litany of crude physical measures of destruction (e.g., number of human
fatalities, number of cities destroyed), the report portrays the
long-term, worldwide effects following a hypothetical exchange of 10,000
megatons of explosive power in the northern hemisphere. These effects
are cast in terms of atmosphere and climate, natural terrestrial
ecosystems, agriculture and animal husbandry, the aquatic environment,
and both somatic and genetic changes in human populations.

While the report recognizes that the biosphere and the species Homo
sapiens would survive the hypothesized nuclear war, it recognizes that
the very idea of survival in such a context is problematic. Building
upon this recognition, a more recent study prepared for the Joint
Committee on Defense Production of the Congress---Economic and Social
Consequences of Nuclear Attacks on the United States---identifies four
discrete levels of postattack survival. This new taxonomy permits a more
subtle look at the interactive effects of nuclear war and allows more
precise judgments about the acceptability or unacceptability of nuclear
attack damage. According to the study, there are four levels of
survival, in decreasing order of damage.

1\. Biological Survival of Individuals. Individuals or groups of
individuals survive but not necessarily within the organized political,
social, and economic structure of a modern society.

2\. Regional Survival of Political Structures. Some subnational
political units survive as viable entities, but without a functioning
central government.

3\. Survival of a Central Government. Some form of viable, central
control over all preattack national territory survives, but the
effectiveness of this control may vary over an extremely wide range,
depending on the specific nature and pattern of the attack(s).

4\. Survival Intact of Basic Societal Structure. Damage to the nation is
characterized as relatively limited socially, politically and
economically; nevertheless, the attack is militarily destructive. This
is the concept of survival envisioned in the notion of limited or
controlled nuclear war. However, it should be noted that the idea that
effective strategic military attacks can be benign in their impacts on
society is in dispute. It is used here as a criterion without any
implicit acceptance that it can be achieved. 19

There are, however, levels of strategic exchange at which even the first
listed category of survival might not be relevant. At such levels, the
species itself---let alone organized political, social, and economic
structures---would disappear. The plausibility of such levels is
underscored by the fact that the magnitude of exchange postulated in the
NAS report is really quite low. Were the superpowers to exchange between
50,000 and 100,000 megatons of nuclear explosives, rather than the
10,000 megatons assumed by the report, worldwide climatological changes
would imperil the physical existence of Homo sapiens.

Worldwide Nuclear War

If nuclear terrorism should lead to worldwide nuclear war,
[the]{.underline} **[results]{.underline}** [would represent
humankind\'s **last and most complete calamity**, defying not only
our]{.underline} **[imaginations]{.underline}** [of disaster, but
our]{.underline} [**customary measurements as well**. As the culmination
of]{.underline} what Camus once described as \"**[years]{.underline}**
[of]{.underline} absolutely [**insane history**,\" worldwide nuclear war
would represent the]{.underline} **[final eradication of the very
boundaries of annihilation]{.underline}**.

In technical terms, the consequences of systemwide nuclear war would
[include **atmospheric effects**; effects on natural]{.underline}
**[terrestrial ecosystems]{.underline}**; effects on managed terrestrial
ecosystems; [and]{.underline} effects on [the]{.underline} **[aquatic
environment]{.underline}**.

Atmospheric effects would be [highlighted by greatly
[reduced]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[ozone]{.underline}**]{.mark}
concentrations producing [increased]{.underline}
**[u]{.underline}**ltra**[v]{.underline}**iolet [radiation]{.underline}
[and a]{.underline} **[drop in]{.underline}** average
**[temperature]{.underline}**. Even the possibility of
**[irreversible]{.underline}** climatic **[shifts]{.underline}** [cannot
be ruled out]{.underline}.

Natural Terrestrial Ecosystems would be affected by systemwide nuclear
war through three principal stress factors: ionizing radiation; uv-B
radiation; and climatic change. [The **cumulative effect**]{.underline}
of these three factors [would [render]{.mark} the]{.underline} **[entire
[planet]{.mark} a \"[hot spot]{.mark}\"]{.underline}** where even vast
forests would [show]{.underline} physiological and **[genetic
damage]{.underline}**.21

Managed Terrestrial Ecosystems would be affected by systemwide nuclear
war by radionuclide contamination of foods, chromosome breakage and gene
mutations in crops, and yield-reducing sterility in seed crops.
[The]{.underline} **[cumulative effect]{.underline}** of these changes
[would be the]{.underline} **[disappearance]{.underline}** [of
the]{.underline} **[tech]{.underline}**nology **[base for
ag]{.underline}**riculture. Even if there were any significant 11
survivors, a return to normal world food production would be
unimaginable.22

Aquatic effects of a systemwide nuclear war would stem from ionizing
radiation from radionuclides in marine waters and fresh waters; solar uv
radiation; and changes in water temperatures associated with climate.
**[Irreversible injuries]{.underline}** to sensitive aquatic species
[could be anticipated]{.underline} during the years of large transient
increase in uv-B isolation. And the range of geographic distribution of
sensitive populations of aquatic organisms could be reduced.23

The RAND Corporation policy analyst made the comments almost two months
after the release of a joint advisory from the United States government
about the infiltration of North Korean operatives across freelance tech
jobs --- posing risks of intellectual property, data and funds theft
that could be used to violate sanctions.

Former FBI intelligence analyst Nick Carlsen told CNN that DPRK
operatives embedded in these firms would not only earn income used to
skirt sanctions, but they could also potentially identify
vulnerabilities in certain client systems that their hacker comrades
could take advantage of.

"Any vulnerability they might identify in a client's systems would be at
grave risk," explained Carlsen.

In a lengthy Twitter exposé about North Korean hackers, The DeFi Edge
noted that these crypto attacks typically target bridges, focus on
companies based in Asia and often begin by targeting unsuspecting
employees.

[some of the **largest cyberattacks** in recent crypto

The United States [D]{.underline}epartment [o]{.underline}f
[J]{.underline}ustice has seized and returned roughly \$500,000 in fiat
and crypto from a hacking group tied to the North Korean government,
which included two crypto payments made by U.S. health care providers.

In a Tuesday announcement, the Justice Department said in conjunction
with the FBI it had [investigated a \$100,000 ransomware payment in
Bitcoin]{.underline} (BTC) from a Kansas hospital [to a]{.underline}
[No]{.underline}rth [Ko]{.underline}rean [hacking group]{.underline} in
order to regain access to its systems, as well as a \$120,000 BTC
payment from a medical provider in Colorado to one of the wallets
connected to the aforementioned attack. In May, the FBI filed a seizure
warrant for funds from the two ransom attacks and others laundered
through China, which the Justice Department reported as worth roughly
\$500,000 total.

"These [sophisticated criminals]{.underline} are [constantly pushing
boundaries to search for ways to **extort money**]{.underline} from
victims by forcing them to pay ramsons in order to regain control of
their computer and record systems," said Duston Slinkar, U.S. Attorney
for the District of Kansas. "What these hackers don't count on is the
tenacity of the U.S. Justice Department in recovering and returning
these funds to the rightful owners."

U.S. Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said in a speech for the
International Conference on Cyber Security on Tuesday that authorities
relied on victims from the private sector to report ransomware attacks
and others "as soon as those crimes occur":

"If you report that attack, if you report the ransom demand and payment,
if you work with the FBI, we can take action; we can follow the money
and get it back; we can help prevent the next attack, the next victim;
and we can hold cybercriminals accountable. Those companies that work
with us will see that we stand with them in the aftermath of an
incident."

According to Monaco, the FBI and Justice Department traced the ransom
payments through the blockchain in much the same way they found and
seized more than \$2 million in crypto following an attack on the
Colonial Pipeline system in 2021. The Office of the Attorney General
late announced the formation of a National Cryptocurrency Enforcement
Team under the Justice Department, and a Virtual Asset Exploitation Unit
under the FBI. Both teams were aimed at addressing cybercrimes used for
"digital extortion" of funds, including crypto.

HBisevac)

But the [boundaries of]{.underline} that "**[better life]{.underline}**"
[have been]{.underline} gradually [curtailed]{.underline} in the more
recent years of Mr [Kim's reign]{.underline}. The point of building a
"prosperous state" was to make his rule more stable. It [did not extend
to allowing a **proper market economy**]{.underline} or granting more
political freedoms to ordinary people. It has been accompanied by
heightened repression inside the country, more control at the borders
and the acceleration of the nuclear programme started by Mr Kim's
predecessors, notably through several tests of intercontinental
ballistic missiles which North Korea claims are capable of reaching
America. The [economic sanctions imposed]{.underline} on the North by
the international community [to slow down the nuclear
programme]{.underline}, which were strengthened in 2017 after the ICBM
tests, [left]{.underline} Mr [Kim with **little money**]{.underline} to
advance other goals beyond building his arsenal.

Mr Kim's attempts to resolve that contradiction in 2018 by courting Mr
Trump and Moon Jae-in, South Korea's president, ended in failure. Mr Kim
miscalculated during his final meeting with Mr Trump in Hanoi in
February 2019. He demanded comprehensive sanctions relief from America
in return for dismantling Yongbyon, an important but ageing nuclear
facility. Mr Trump rebuffed him, causing the summit to collapse.

That might have been manageable, since Mr Kim's other diplomatic
overtures in this period, notably towards China, had slightly more
success and ensured a steady flow of trade, both legal and illicit. But
when the coronavirus pandemic struck, Mr Kim's response put paid to
that, too. The [border with China has been closed for]{.underline} the
best part of [two years]{.underline}. [It is likely to
remain]{.underline} so [for the foreseeable future]{.underline}, though
there have recently been rumours of a limited opening. Tourism is
moribund. Most foreign diplomats have left the country. Aid
organisations have not had access for nearly two years, making it
especially hard to discern what is going on in the country.

[There are hints of **increasing distress**]{.underline}, with **[food
running low]{.underline}** and [even the privileged]{.underline} in
Pyongyang [suffering shortages]{.underline}. Mr [Kim]{.underline}
himself has [admitted]{.underline} that the [food situation
is]{.underline} "**[tense]{.underline}**" and urged his people to
prepare for hardship. But he has also increased penalties for smuggling
and for watching foreign entertainment, such as South Korean dramas.

There is [**little indication** that things will soon
improve]{.underline}. Mr Kim continues to rebuff offers of aid and even
covid vaccines. Attempts by South Korea and America to revive a spirit
of detente, for instance by negotiating a formal end to the Korean war,
have gone unanswered. Ten years into his rule, [the]{.underline}
"[economically powerful state]{.underline}" Mr [Kim set out to build is
looking]{.underline} rather [feeble]{.underline}. He may console himself
with the continuing growth of his nuclear arsenal. His people have no
such luxury.

SEOUL, May 3 (Reuters) - [No]{.underline}rth [Ko]{.underline}rea\'s

[Strict international sanctions]{.underline} ban or [restrict **wide

its border for years to prevent COVID-19 outbreaks. **[Natural
disasters]{.underline}** such as flooding have also [taken a toll on
**harvests** and **damaged infra**]{.underline}structure.

The trickle of trade and [aid]{.underline} that resumed over the land
border [with China]{.underline} in January probably [did not alleviate
reported food shortages]{.underline} - and trade was suspended again
last week as COVID-19 cases rose in China, analysts said. Satellite
imagery shows goods sitting for weeks or months in quarantine at land
and sea port facilities.

"As food prices in North Korea do often move in tandem with global
prices, we\'re [likely to see current **food price hikes**]{.underline}
mirrored [in]{.underline} [No]{.underline}rth [Ko]{.underline}rea as
well [over time]{.underline}," said Benjamin Katzeff Silberstein, an
economic expert with the U.S.-based Stimson Center.

International aid organizations have pulled most of their staff from the
country amid the prolonged border shutdowns, and say it is difficult to
know exactly how bad the situation is.

Last year the U.N. special rapporteur on human rights in North Korea
said the country\'s most vulnerable people risk starvation during the
COVID-19 pandemic.

North Korea\'s government has acknowledged a tense food situation but
has disputed reports that it is failing to provide for residents.

The World Food Program estimated that even before the pandemic hit, 11
million people -- or more than 40 percent of the population - were
undernourished and required humanitarian assistance.

BOON FOR ILLICIT COAL

Higher energy prices globally will most likely help North Korean coal
producers, Katzeff Silberstein said.

[No]{.underline}rth [Ko]{.underline}rean coal -- which is [banned from
export by]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[N]{.underline}**ations **[S]{.underline}**ecurity

average. But [prices]{.underline} still have [soared 40%]{.underline} in

commodities prices in the North.

a confidential United Nations report seen on Saturday by Reuters.

The annual report by independent sanctions monitors was submitted on
Friday evening to the U.N. Security Council North Korea sanctions
committee.

\"Although no nuclear tests or launches of ICBMs (intercontinental
ballistic missiles) were reported, DPRK continued to develop its
capability for production of nuclear fissile materials,\" the experts
wrote.

North Korea is formally known as the Democratic People\'s Republic of
Korea (DPRK). It has long-been banned from conducting nuclear tests and
ballistic missile launches by the U.N. Security Council.

\"Maintenance and development of DPRK\'s nuclear and ballistic missile
infrastructure continued, and [[DPRK]{.mark} continued to [seek]{.mark}
**material**]{.underline}, [**technology** and **[know-how]{.mark}**
[for]{.mark}]{.underline} these [[programs]{.underline}]{.mark}
overseas, [including [through]{.mark} **[cyber]{.mark}

Since 2006, North Korea has been subject to U.N. sanctions, which the
Security Council has strengthened over the years in an effort to target
funding for Pyongyang\'s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.

The sanctions monitors noted that [there had [been]{.mark}
a]{.underline} \"**[[marked acceleration]{.underline}]{.mark}**\"
[[of]{.mark} missile [testing]{.mark}]{.underline} by Pyongyang.

The United States and others said on Friday that North Korea had carried
out nine ballistic missile launches in January, adding it was the
largest number in a single month in the history of the country\'s
weapons of mass destruction and missile programs.

\"[DPRK [demonstrated]{.mark} increased [capabilities]{.mark}
[for]{.mark} **[rapid deployment]{.mark}**]{.underline}, **[wide
mobility]{.underline}** (including at sea), [and **improved
resilience**]{.underline} of its missile forces,\" the sanctions
monitors said.

North Korea\'s mission to the United Nations in New York did not
immediately respond to a request for comment.

CYBERATTACKS, ILLICIT TRADE

The monitors said \"[cyberattacks]{.underline}, particularly on
cryptocurrency assets, [remain an important revenue

[[No]{.underline}]{.mark}rth [[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}rean

\"According to a member state, [DPRK [cyberactors stole]{.mark}
[more]{.mark} than **\$50 million** between 2020 and mid-2021
from]{.underline} at least three **[cryptocurrency
exchanges]{.underline}** in North America, Europe and Asia,\" the report
said.

The monitors also cited a report last month by cybersecurity firm
Chainalysis that said [No]{.underline}rth [Ko]{.underline}rea [launched
at least seven attacks on cryptocurrency platforms that extracted nearly
**[\$400]{.mark} [million]{.mark}** worth of **digital

The latest report said North Korea\'s strict blockade in response to the

"[Things were completely different after sanctions took
effect]{.underline}," says one person with knowledge of the situation.

The demise of the scheme to raise funds in the Gulf is [one result of
the]{.underline} 15-year-long campaign of [increasingly harsh sanctions
dubbed]{.underline} "**[maximum pressure]{.underline}**", [led by the UN
and the US]{.underline}, [that]{.underline} have been [designed to choke
off the regime's **sources of income**]{.underline}.

Yet despite some successes, experts say [No]{.underline}rth
[Ko]{.underline}rea is [still managing to find **new ways** to **get
around** the **sanctions**]{.underline}, [including
**crypto**]{.underline}currency [**theft** and lucrative **cyber
heists**]{.underline}.

The sanctions ultimately cause more harm by pushing the secretive state
deeper into its shell, some experts say. They add that there are clear
signs that the state's acquisition of stocks of nuclear and chemical
weapons has not been curtailed by the sanctions regime.

Ordinary North Koreans have suffered as a result of the sanctions and
their plight has worsened in the past 18 months: a crackdown on
cross-border trade and travel --- a bid by Pyongyang to keep the
coronavirus pandemic at bay --- has severed access to China, North
Korea's main economic lifeline. All the while, the lavish lifestyle of
the leader Kim Jong Un and his court continues unabashed.

Rachel Lee, a former US government analyst now with the 38 North
programme at the Stimson Center think-tank in Washington, describes the
dichotomy as "two different worlds --- there is definitely a disconnect
between the lifestyle of not just the Kim family but the top elite, and
the remainder of the population".

The failure of sanctions is prompting calls for President Joe Biden's
administration to overhaul what has been a de facto policy in four
successive administrations.

"The original intention has not been achieved --- North Korea's nuclear
weapons and missile capabilities have been strengthened," says one
former senior presidential adviser in Seoul who has dealt directly with
Pyongyang. "Yet the collateral damage has been widespread. The North
Korean people are suffering. Efforts towards reform and opening and a
market system have been further delayed. But they cannot get away from
it because sanctions have become a kind of theology in Washington,
nobody can touch it."

Violation and defection

North Korea's overseas labourers are just one strand in a massive web of
duplicitous schemes designed with a singular purpose: to bring in cash
for the Kim regime. UN investigators, as well as law enforcement and
military officials from scores of countries, have for years tracked
individuals, companies and governments in order to stamp down on
sanctions breaches.

A small sample of the alleged UN violations linked to Pyongyang's
foreign embassies in recent years include military delegations advising
countries in Africa, Iranians suspected of smuggling gold and cash to
North Korea, an attempted arms deal in Egypt and coal shipments brokered
by Indonesian commodity traders.

Few nations have managed to avoid being touched by the Kim regime's long
tentacles. Between 2015 and 2017, North Korea procured luxury goods from
as many as 90 countries, according to the Center for Advanced Defense
Studies, a Washington research group.

For many experts, the [state's increased aptitude for **cyber crime** is
of **greater worry** than where Kim sources his ***black
Mercedes-Maybach limousines***]{.underline}.

In March, a UN report included an [estimate of
crypto]{.underline}currency [theft worth **\$316m**]{.underline} from
2019 to November 2020. According to one complaint filed by the US
justice department in August 2020, [one hacker linked to
No]{.underline}rth [Ko]{.underline}rea "[allegedly stole over
**\$272,000 worth**]{.underline} of alternative cryptocurrencies and
tokens, including Proton Tokens, PlayGame tokens and IHT Real Estate
Protocol \[blockchain\] tokens".

"The [targeting of virtual assets]{.underline} and virtual asset service
providers [is **rampant**]{.underline}," says Stephanie
Kleine-Ahlbrandt, who for five years until 2019 served as the finance
and economics expert on the UN panel of experts tracking North Korean
sanctions.

you **have the funds** to pay for it]{.underline}," explained a senior
U.S. intelligence official.

The official continued:

History shows the [intelligence officials\' fears could **very well be
realized**]{.underline} --- and soon. [North Korea has sold arms to some
of the world's most **anti-U.S. regimes** and **fueled conflicts around
the world.**]{.underline}

For example, [Pyongyang has reportedly helped Syria with
its]{.underline} chemical weapons and [missile programs]{.underline}.
[North Korea even started building a **nuclear reactor**]{.underline}
for the Assad regime, only to see it be destroyed by an Israeli air
strike in 2007. There is strong evidence to suggest North Korea is
selling conventional arms to the regime now and possibly even fighting
alongside Assad's forces, fueling a civil war that has claimed countless
lives to this day.

It gets worse. The [Kim]{.underline} family [has sold **multiple classes
of missile platforms** to Iran]{.underline}. And, [[now that the
Kim]{.mark} family [has missiles that can]{.mark} at least [range the
U.S.]{.mark} homeland, [combined with]{.mark} **biting
[sanctions]{.mark}** [that are **damaging**]{.mark} the regime\'s
ability to **raise [vital revenue]{.mark}**]{.underline}[,
[Pyongyang]{.underline}]{.mark} [[might]{.mark} just [be **desperate
enough** to **sell its best weaponry**]{.mark}]{.underline}, even if it
were to damage its budding détente with Washington.

Factors and Actions That Have Increased the Risk of Nuclear Terrorism

Despite these successes, [there have also been **numerous missed
opportunities** and **structural shifts** during the past 13 years that
have **increased the risk of nuclear terrorism**]{.underline}. Obama's
success in Iran is offset by his failure to stop North Korea's nuclear
advance. [**[North Korea]{.mark}** is today the world's leading
candidate to become **'Nukes 'R' Us.'**]{.underline} Long known in
intelligence circles as 'Missiles 'R' Us' for having sold and delivered
missiles to Iran, Syria, Pakistan, and others, [it [has]{.mark}
repeatedly [demonstrated its willingness to '**sell anything it has** to
**anybody who has the cash**]{.mark} **to buy it,**']{.underline} as
former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates famously noted.23 [Indeed,
anyone who doubts that [No]{.mark}rth [Ko]{.mark}rea [would sell]{.mark}
to others the wherewithal to make **[a nuclear bomb]{.mark}** should
pause and examine what they did in Syria.]{.underline} As we learned
after Israel attacked and destroyed the Yongbyon-model reactor at
al-Kibar in Syria in 2007, [[No]{.mark}rth [Ko]{.mark}rea [sold]{.mark}
[**materials, designs**, and **expertise** to help Syria build a
**plutonium-producing nuclear reactor**]{.mark}]{.underline}.24 By now
that reactor would have produced enough plutonium [[for a **dozen
nuclear bombs**.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Moreover, what price did North Korea pay for having proliferated
nuclear-weapons technologies and materials? In 2006, after watching
North Korea test its first nuclear device and fearing that it might do
something this reckless, President [Bush issued a]{.underline} solemn
warning. Declaring that sale or transfer of any nuclear weapon or
nuclear-weapons material and technologies would cross a **[bright red
line]{.underline}**, Bush warned that any sale that violated this
prohibition would be held 'fully accountable.'25 But after [North
Korea]{.underline} was found to have [**disregarded** this
warning]{.underline}, how did the United States respond? When Israel
informed the Bush Administration that it had discovered this facility as
the project was approaching completion, the United States not only
failed to take military action itself to stop it, but urged Israel to
take the issue to the United Nations. Just weeks after Israel
disregarded U.S. advice and destroyed the reactor, the United States
returned to the Six-Party Talks with North Korea. And less than a year
later, President Bush gave the Kim regime a significant concession by
removing it from the list of state sponsors of terrorism in return for
inspections on and initial steps to dismantle the Yongbyon reactor---a
deal that Pyongyang reneged on just six months later when it kicked out
the inspectors and announced that it would resume reprocessing at the
reactor.26

When Nuclear Terrorism appeared in 2004, [North Korea]{.underline} had
yet to conduct a nuclear test. Since then, it [has conducted **six
nuclear tests,** including one in September 2017 that produced a yield
**ten-times** that of the **Hiroshima bomb**]{.underline}.27 In Obama's
two terms, Kim Jong Un and his father, Kim Jong Il, conducted 80 missile
tests. In Trump's first year in office, Kim Jong Un has so far conducted
20 additional missile tests, including three ICBM tests.28 Today, North
Korea stands on the threshold of a credible nuclear threat to the U.S.
homeland. If North Korea succeeds in completing its nuclear deterrent,
leaders of other rogue states will certainly take note.

As North Korea has continued violating UN injunctions to halt its
nuclear and missile programs, [the United States and its allies have
**ratcheted up sanctions** on the Kim regime]{.underline}. The United
States and China now insist that the most severe sanctions ever are
'biting' and that 'maximum pressure' on North Korea will force the Kim
regime to relent and comply in order to avoid collapse. Those who have
been watching this issue for the past two decades have heard that hope
before. [Moreover, [**tightening sanctions** give a **cash-strapped
regime** greater incentives to turn to the **nuclear black
market.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

The United States has warned Kim Jong Un that selling nuclear weapons or
weapons-usable nuclear materials would cross an inviolable red line. But
as noted above, President Bush drew this red line a decade ago for Kim's
father---but to no effect. At this point, how credible will another
threat from the United States to 'punish' North Korea for selling
nuclear weapons or material be? Indeed, our predicament today is even
more difficult. If Kim Jong Un launches his next series of ICBM tests
and the IC concludes that he has the capability to attack the American
homeland, how credible will any U.S. threat to punish North Korea for
anything short of a full-scale attack on South Korea or the United
States be? As Kim's advisers will ask, if the United States is not
prepared to act on its threat to prevent North Korea from acquiring the
ability to strike the American homeland, why would they act if North
Korea sold nuclear weapons to Iran?

Even if Trump succeeds in halting Kim's progress short of a credible
ICBM threat to the U.S. homeland, which seems unlikely at this point,
[the threat of **nuclear terrorism** emanating from North Korea will
continue to require a **significant U.S. campaign** to **deter** and
**prevent**. Due to the inability of previous administrations to stop
North Korea's progress earlier, [a **nuclear-armed**]{.mark} **North
[Korea]{.mark}**[, with the **capacity** and]{.mark} perhaps
**[willingness to sell]{.mark}**, [will remain a]{.mark} **major
[challenge]{.mark}** not only for Trump but for his
successors.]{.underline}

[tech]{.mark}**]{.underline}nology **[[grows]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
Pyongyang conducted its fifth nuclear test on 9 September, accompanied
by claims it has developed a warhead that can be mounted onto rockets.
This test is estimated to have been at a yield of 25--30 kilotons ---
significantly larger than previous tests.

While the magnitude of the test alarmed some US policymakers,
Washington's foreign policy remains focused on the Middle East.
Similarly, North Korea's subsequent missile tests that ended in failure
on 15 and 20 October gained little attention.

There appears to be a de facto acceptance by some in the Obama
administration that [No]{.underline}rth [Ko]{.underline}rea [will **not
agree** to **denuclearize**]{.underline} --- regardless of the
concessions. Earlier this month, Obama's top intelligence chief, James
Clapper, remarked at an event hosted by the Council on Foreign Relations
that "the notion of getting the North Koreans to denuclearize is
probably a lost cause." Despite Clapper's remarks, the Obama
administration as a whole continues to insist that a nuclear North Korea
is not an option regardless of their unwillingness to disarm.

Meanwhile, [[**concerns** remain]{.mark} [about]{.mark}]{.underline} the
possible [[transfer]{.mark} of]{.underline} [No]{.underline}rth
[Ko]{.underline}rea's [nuclear tech]{.underline}nology and knowledge
[[to **non-state actors**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Hillary Clinton
considers their "[quest for a nuclear weapon]{.underline}" [a grave
threat because]{.underline} "[the **[greatest threat]{.mark}** of all
[would be terrorists]{.mark} getting their hands on **[loose]{.mark}
[nuc]{.mark}lear [material]{.mark}**]{.underline}." So how likely is
North Korea to engage in a nuclear arms sale with a terrorist group?

Up until this point, [prolif]{.underline}eration [of No]{.underline}rth
[Ko]{.underline}rea's [weapons of mass destruction]{.underline} seemed
to be restricted to sovereign states. But this has [not stopped
apprehension from]{.underline} some in [the **intelligence
community**]{.underline} --- spurred by Pyongyang's connections to
Libya's Gaddafi regime and ties to Syria's failed nuclear weapons
program.

Over the years [No]{.underline}rth [Ko]{.underline}rea has [created a
web of **foreign connections** to peddle its **missiles**]{.underline}
and components. [As talks on **denuclearization** remain
**non**]{.underline}-**[existent]{.underline}** and foreign sanctions
against the regime tighten, there are [startling concerns that a
**[cash-strapped]{.mark} [Pyongyang]{.mark}**]{.underline} may [[resort
to]{.mark} [dealing]{.mark} [with]{.mark} its [finances]{.mark} through
the black-market [with **terrorist**]{.mark} **group[s]{.mark}** or
**organized crime syndicates**]{.underline}.

While [the threat may seem fanciful]{.underline} --- even for a state as
repugnant to international rules as North Korea --- **[the risks are
real]{.underline}**. The official and [**unofficial transfer** of
nuc]{.underline}lear [tech]{.underline}nology [has always been a method
of **global outreach** for No]{.underline}rth [Ko]{.underline}rea.
[Nuclear]{.underline} [prolif]{.underline}eration t[o non-state actors
is a viable option for this regime when it feels
**threatened**]{.underline}, [**economically cornered** and
**politically unstable**]{.underline}. [Pyongyang is **strapped** for
**funds**]{.underline} despite China's less than ideal compliance of UN
sanctions --- [which has kept the]{.underline} little [trade they have
**alive** and **enabled** the state to **continue**]{.underline} to
obtain materials and funds for missile tests.

As tougher sanctions are imposed, [[No]{.underline}]{.mark}rth

Nuclear terrorism post-cold war: trigger for inadvertent nuclear war?

The possible catalytic effect of nuclear terrorism on the risk of
state-based nuclear war is not a simple linkage. [The multiple
types]{.underline} and scales [of nuclear
[terrori]{.mark}sm]{.underline} may affect state-nuclear use decisions
along multiple pathways [that [lead to **inadvertent**]{.mark} **nuclear
[war]{.mark}**.]{.underline} These [include:]{.underline}

- **[[E]{.underline}]{.mark}**arly **[[w]{.underline}]{.mark}**arning
  **[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}**ystems fail or [are **["tripped"]{.mark}**
  in ways that lead to **l**aunch-**o**n-**w**arning]{.underline}

- [**[Accidental]{.mark}** nuclear [detonation]{.mark}]{.underline},
  including sub-critical explosions.

- Strategic [**[miscalc]{.mark}ulation** in crisis]{.underline}, show of
  force

- Decision-making failure (such as irrational, misperception, bias,
  degraded, group, and time-compressed decision-making)

- Allied or enemy choices (to seek revenge, to exploit nuclear risk, to
  act out of desperation)

- Organizational cybernetics whereby a nuclear command-control-and
  communications [(NC3) system generates **error**]{.underline},
  including the interplay of national NC3 systems in what may be termed
  the meta-NC3 system.

Synchronous and coincident combinations of above.\[4\]

Exactly how, where, and when nuclear terrorism may "ambush" nuclear
armed states already heading for or on such a path to inadvertent
nuclear war depends on who is targeting whom at a given time, either
immediately due to high tension, or generally due to a structural
conflict between states. Nuclear armed states today form a complex set
of global threat relationships that are not distributed uniformly across
the face of Earth. Rather, based on sheer firepower and reach, the nine
nuclear weapons states form a global hierarchy with at least four tiers,
viz:

> Tier 1: United States, clear technological supremacy and qualitative
> edge.
>
> Tier 2: Russia, China, global nuclear powers and peers with the United
> States due to the unique destructive power of even relatively small
> nuclear arsenals, combined with global reach of missile and bomber
> delivery systems, thereby constituting a two-tiered global "nuclear
> triangle" with the United States.
>
> Tier 3: France, UK, NATO nuclear sharing and delivery NATO members
> (Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Turkey) and the NATO and
> Pacific nuclear umbrella states (Japan, South Korea, Australia) that
> depend on American nuclear extended deterrence and directly and
> indirectly support US and US-allied nuclear operations even though
> they do not host nor deliver nuclear weapons themselves.
>
> Tier 4: India, Pakistan, Israel, DPRK.

The first two tiers constitute the global nuclear threat triangle that
exists between the United States, Russia, and China, forming a global
nuclear "truel." Each of these states targets the others; each
represents an existential threat to the other; and each has a long
history of mutual nuclear threat that is now a core element of their
strategic identity.

Tier three consists of states with their own nuclear force but
integrated with that of the United States (even France!) that expand the
zone of mutual nuclear threat over much of the northern and even parts
of the southern hemisphere; and states that host American nuclear
command, control, communications, and intelligence systems that support
US nuclear operations and to whom nuclear deterrence is "extended" (if,
for example, Australia's claim to having an American nuclear umbrella is
believed). The fourth tier is composed of smaller nuclear forces with a
primarily regional reach and focus.

Between most of these nuclear armed states and across the tiers, there
are few shared "rules of the road." The more of these states that are
engaged in a specific conflict and location, the more unpredictable and
unstable this global nuclear threat system becomes, with the potential
for cascading and concatenating effects. Indeed, as the number of
nuclear states projecting nuclear threat against each other increases,
the notion of strategic stability may lose all meaning.

The emergence of a fifth tier---of non-state actors with the capacity to
project nuclear threat against nuclear-armed and nuclear umbrella states
(although not only these states)---is a critically important possible
catalytic actor in the new conditions of nuclear threat complexity that
already exist today. Such a layer represents an "edge of chaos" where
the attempts by nuclear armed states to exert absolute "vertical"
control over the use of nuclear weapons confront the potential of
non-state entities and even individuals (insiders) to engage in
"horizontal" nuclear terrorism, presenting radically different control
imperatives to the standard paradigm of organizational procedures,
technical measures, and safeguards of various kinds. This tier is like
the waves and tides on a beach that quickly surrounds and then causes
sand castles to collapse.

In 2010, Robert Ayson reviewed the potential linkages between
inter-state nuclear war and non-state terrorism. He concluded:
"...\[T\]hese two nuclear worlds---[a non-state actor nuclear attack and
a catastrophic interstate nuclear exchange---are not]{.underline}
necessarily [separable]{.underline}. It is just possible that some sort
of terrorist attack, and especially [an act of [nuc]{.mark}lear
[terror]{.mark}ism, could **[precipitate]{.mark} a chain of events**
leading to a **[mass]{.mark}ive [exchange]{.mark} of nuclear
weapons**]{.underline} between two or more of the states that possess
them."\[5\] How this linkage might unfold is the subject of the next
sections of this essay.

[The conclusion is unavoidable that there a non-state [nuc]{.mark}lear
[terro]{.mark}rist]{.underline} attack in the Northeast Asia region [is
possible]{.underline}. The following sections outline the possible
situations in which [nuclear terrorist attacks might]{.underline} be
implicated as a **[[trigger]{.underline}]{.mark}** to
[**[interstate]{.mark} conflict**, and even **nuclear
[war]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Particular attention is paid to the how
[nuclear **c**]{.underline}ommand, control **[and
c]{.underline}**ommunications systems [may play an]{.underline}
independent and [unanticipated role in [leading to]{.mark} inadvertent
**nuclear war**, separate to]{.underline} the contributors to

"wetware" **[(human failures)]{.underline}**, software or hardware
failures; [[and **misinterpretation** of]{.underline}]{.mark} intended
or unintended [signals]{.underline} from an adversary.

Regional pathways to interstate nuclear war

[At least **[five]{.mark} distinct [nuclear]{.mark}-prone
[axes]{.mark}** of conflict are **evident**]{.underline} in Northeast
Asia. These are:

1.  **[US-[DPRK]{.mark} conflict]{.underline}** (including with United
    States, US allies Japan, South Korea and Australia; and all other
    UNC command allies. Many permutations possible ranging from
    non-violent collapse to implosion and civil war, inter-Korean war,
    slow humanitarian crisis. Of these implosion-civil war in the DPRK
    may be the most dangerous, followed closely by an altercation at the
    Joint Security Area at Panmunjon where US, ROK, and DPRK soldiers
    interact constantly.

2.  [**China-[Taiwan]{.mark}** conflict]{.underline}, whereby China may
    use nuclear weapons to overcome US forces operating in the West
    Pacific, either at sea, or based on US (Guam, Alaska) or US allied
    territory in the ROK, Japan, the Philippines, or Australia); or US
    uses nuclear weapons in response to Chinese attack on Taiwan.

3.  [**China-[Japan]{.mark}** conflict]{.underline} escalates via
    attacks on early warning systems, for example, underwater hydrophone
    systems (Ayson-Ball, 2011).

4.  [**[China]{.mark}-Russia** conflict]{.underline}, possibly in
    context of loss-of-control of Chinese nuclear forces in a regional
    conflict involving Taiwan or North Korea.

5.  [**[Russia]{.mark}-US** conflict]{.underline}, involving horizontal
    escalation from a head-on collision with Russian nuclear forces in
    Europe or the Middle East; or somehow starts at sea (mostly likely
    seems ASW) or over North Korea (some have cited risk of US missile
    defenses against North Korean attack as risking Russian immediate
    response).

[**[Combinations]{.mark}** of]{.underline} or simultaneous eruption of
the above [conflicts that [**culminate** in **nuc**]{.mark}**lear
[war]{.mark}** are]{.underline} also [possible]{.underline}. Other
unanticipated nuclear-prone conflict axes (such as Russia-Japan) could
also emerge with little warning.

# **In these pre-MAD situations, there are at least three ways that nuclear war could occur.

That is, in a crisis, Iran might decide to strike first rather than risk having its entire nuclear arsenal destroyed. Third, as Thomas Schelling has argued, [nuclear war could result due to the reciprocal fear of surprise attack]{.underline}.49 If there are advantages to striking first, [one state might start a nuclear war in the belief that war is]{.underline}** [inevitable **and that it would be** better to go first than to go second]{.underline}**. Fortunately, there is no historic evidence of this dynamic occurring in a nuclear context, but it is still possible.

Leaders might, therefore, choose to launch a limited nuclear war.50 This strategy might be especially attractive to states in a position of conventional inferiority that might have an incentive to escalate a crisis quickly to the nuclear level. During the Cold War, the United States planned to use nuclear weapons first to stop a Soviet invasion of Western Europe given NATO's conventional inferiority.51 As Russia's conventional power has deteriorated since the end of the Cold War, Moscow has come to rely more heavily on nuclear weapons in its military doctrine. Indeed, Russian strategy calls for the use of nuclear weapons early in a conflict (something that most Western strategists would consider to be escalatory) as a way to de-escalate a crisis. Similarly, Pakistan's military plans for nuclear use in the event of an invasion from conventionally stronger India.

There is nothing automatic about [the nuclear **[domino

some regions, but the theory [[is]{.mark} generally
**[correct]{.mark}**. The Soviet Union got the bomb
because]{.underline}, as Stalin told his scientists [after Hiroshima,
"The balance has been broken]{.underline}. Build the bomb. It will
remove the great danger from us." [Britain and France got the bomb
because the Soviets (and the U.S.) had it. China did the same, then
India]{.underline} got the bomb because China did; [Pakistan because
India did]{.underline}.

Nuclear competition in Asia would not end if South Korea decided to
build a nuclear arsenal. [[Others]{.underline}]{.mark} in the region
[[would]{.mark} likely **[follow]{.mark} suit**]{.underline}. Japan,
Taiwan, perhaps Vietnam. Similarly, a Saudi bomb would likely beget an
Iranian bomb, a Turkish bomb and even an Egyptian bomb. Far from making
the region --- and the United States --- safer, these [**[arms
races]{.mark}** would [**blanket the globe** with]{.mark} **nuclear
[tripwires]{.mark}**, each [**primed** to **unleash**]{.mark}
**unprecedented [destruction]{.mark}** at the slightest
twitch]{.underline}.

Where you stand determines what you see. Kennedy and the other
[presidents]{.underline} stood atop the chain of command, and their own
experiences with that awful responsibility (particularly with the
near-miss of the Cuban Missile Crisis) colored how they saw nuclear
politics. They [recognized the limitations of theory in a world
characterized by **imperfect information** and the **frictions of human
interaction**. They understood what the nuclear theorists could not ---
that more countries having nuclear weapons would **only increase** the
risk of their use, **not lessen** it]{.underline}.

Three months before the Cuban Crisis, Kennedy's Secretary of Defense,
Robert McNamara, gave a speech in Ann Arbor, Michigan where he laid out
this danger. "The mere fact that no nation could rationally take steps
leading to nuclear war does not guarantee that a nuclear war cannot take
place," he said. "Not only do nations sometimes act in ways that are
hard to explain on a rational basis, but [**even when**
acting]{.underline} in a **['rational']{.underline}** way
[they]{.underline} sometimes, indeed disturbingly [often, act on the
basis of **misunderstandings**]{.underline} of the true facts of a
situation. They misjudge the way others will react, and the way others
will interpret what they are doing."

[Any attempt to rationalize nuclear relationships --- treating
adversaries like two sides of a balanced equation --- removes the
**human factor**: the tendency towards irrationality and error. In a
world with just a handful of nuclear states, that factor has **already**
nearly led to [apocalypse]{.mark}. In a world with a **dozen more**,
those [risks]{.mark} would **[go up
exponentially]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[It does not have to be this way. [For]{.mark} over [50 years]{.mark},

Gerzhoy and **Miller 16** (Gene Gerzhoy - Former Research Fellow Project
on Managing the Atom/International Security Program and now a
Congressional Fellow at the American Political Science Association,
Nicholas Miller - Associate Professor in the Department of Government at
Dartmouth College, "Donald Trump thinks more countries should have

[Research does not support the idea that the spread of nuclear weapons
is **inevitable**]{.underline}. But isolationist "America First"
policies could prompt that spread. Defining U.S. strategic interests
primarily in terms of monetary gain, and [curtailing U.S. global
engagement toward that end, would boost the probability that our
**allies would respond by going nuclear**.]{.underline}

Would nuclear proliferation be good for U.S. interests?

What about Trump's second proposition: that proliferation by our allies
would be good for U.S. interests? This argument is based on the idea
that nuclear-armed allies could help contain U.S. adversaries and enable
the United States to save money. As Trump told Cooper, "I would rather
see Japan having some form of defense, and maybe even offense, against
North Korea." And as he suggested, the United States can't afford to
protect Japan and South Korea --- and therefore, "they have to pay us or
we have to let them protect themselves."

[Reducing military commitments and letting allies build their own
nuclear weapons might save money for the United States. But
international relations scholarship suggests that allied proliferation
would have broader negative repercussions. Among these would be
**declining U.S. influence**. When nations gain their own military
capabilities, they **rely less on their allies** and become less subject
to their sway. And that can undermine a senior partner's ability to hold
its junior allies back from risky military actions.]{.underline}

[In other words, allowing or encouraging proliferation would worsen the
"American weakness"]{.underline} that Trump decries.

[Recent nonproliferation research underscores this proposition. Mark
Bell shows that nuclear allies are likely to become more independent of
their patrons and in some cases can **develop more assertive foreign
policies**.]{.underline} And Francis Gavin and Matthew Kroenig show that
the fear of declining influence was one reason why most American
administrations vigorously opposed the spread of nuclear weapons.

[**Nuclear allies** can also become **security risks**.]{.underline}
Vipin Narang demonstrates that [when weaker states gain nuclear weapons,
they often seek to coerce their senior partners into intervening on
their behalf by threatening to use nuclear weapons]{.underline}. That's
what Israel did at the height of the 1973 Arab-Israeli War. That's what
South Africa did during its 1988 confrontation with Cuban forces in
Angola. And that's what Pakistan did in the midst of its 1990 military
crisis with India.

Instead of relieving the United States of a military burden, as Donald
Trump suggests, [having more nuclear allies could increase the risk that
the United States would **get involved in conflicts that might turn
nuclear**.]{.underline}

[Furthermore, were South Korea or Japan to begin developing nuclear
weapons, their rivals might be tempted to launch preventive military
strikes]{.underline}, which research suggests has been frequently
considered in the past. [The road to nuclear acquisition is often rocky
and **increases the likelihood of militarized conflict**]{.underline}.
For example, Soviet worries that West Germany would acquire nuclear
weapons helped trigger the Berlin Crisis.

[And if Japan or South Korea actually acquired nuclear weapons, we could
possibly see a **nuclear arms race in Asia**.]{.underline} Japan's
neighbors, including South Korea, would fear resurgent Japanese
militarism. [North Korea would expand its nuclear capabilities. China
would continue to expand its own nuclear arsenal.]{.underline}

Why haven't we seen nuclear arms races before?

effects"]{.underline}](https://repository.library.georgetown.edu/handle/10822/558060) have
not been common historically. But that's largely because of [[determined
U.S. efforts to stop
them]{.underline}](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09636412.2014.874189).

Since the dawn of the nuclear age, the United States has [[pursued
nonproliferation as a top policy
priority]{.underline}](http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/ISEC_a_00205#.VwAzcxMrJfQ).
That includes sponsoring and enforcing the [[Nonproliferation Treaty
(NPT)]{.underline}](http://www.un.org/disarmament/WMD/Nuclear/NPTtext.shtml). [[Research
suggests the
NPT]{.underline}](http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/682080) has
been instrumental in limiting the spread of nuclear weapons, in part by
coordinating states' beliefs about one another's nonproliferation
commitments. To develop nuclear weapons, Japan and South Korea would
need to violate or withdraw from the NPT. [That could prompt U.S. allies
and adversaries in other regions --- including Saudi Arabia, Germany and
Iran --- to question the treaty's viability and consider seeking their
own nuclear arsenals.]{.underline}

Would this be so bad? After all, no two nuclear armed states have fought
a major war with each other, and nuclear weapons have not been used in
conflict since the United States bombed Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945.

[But the conclusion that nuclear weapons produce peace is subject to
debate. It's true that there has been no war between major powers since
1945. But that may be due
to [other](http://www.jstor.org/stable/2538971) [factors](https://books.google.com/books?id=J7ATQb6LZX0C&dq=pinker+angels&lr=&source=gbs_navlinks_s).
The quantitative evidence linking nuclear weapons to a reduced risk of
conflict
is [limited](http://jcr.sagepub.com/content/57/3/478.short)** **[at
best](http://jcr.sagepub.com/content/59/1/74).]{.underline}

[Further, [theoretical and historical evidence suggests that nuclear
accidents and miscalculations are
likely](http://press.princeton.edu/titles/5301.html). More countries
with nuclear weapons would mean more opportunities for catastrophic
nuclear mistakes.]{.underline}

So what's the takeaway?

[A look at history shows us that nuclear proliferation is **anything but
inevitable**.]{.underline} U.S. nonproliferation efforts have been
surprisingly successful, even when the United States was weaker than it
is today.

Without firm U.S. opposition to the spread of nuclear weapons --- a
policy implemented through "carrots" like alliances and "sticks" like
sanctions --- the world would probably have far more than nine countries
with nuclear weapons. [What's more, research suggests that nuclear
proliferation would **reduce U.S. world influence**, undermine global
stability and **increase the risk of nuclear war**.]{.underline}

N-Player Competition

[Were **Saudi**]{.underline} Arabia [to acquire **nuclear weapons**, the
Middle East would count **three** nuclear-armed states, and perhaps
**more before long**.]{.underline} It is unclear how such an n-player
competition would unfold because most analyses of nuclear deterrence are
based on the U.S.-Soviet rivalry during the Cold War. It seems likely,
however, that [the interaction among **[three]{.mark}** or **more
[nuclear]{.mark}-armed [powers]{.mark}** [would be **more prone** to
**miscalc**]{.mark}**ulation** [and **escalation**]{.mark}]{.underline}
than a bipolar competition. During the Cold War, the United States and
the Soviet Union only needed to concern themselves with an attack from
the other. **[Multi polar systems]{.underline}** are generally
considered to be less stable than bipolar systems because coalitions
[can **shift quickly**, upsetting the **balance of power** and creating
incentives for an **attack**.]{.underline} More important, [emerging
nuclear powers in the Middle East might not take the **costly steps
necessary** to **preserve regional stability** and **avoid a nuclear
exchange**. For nuclear-armed states, the **bedrock** of deterrence is
the knowledge that each side has a **secure second-strike
capability**]{.underline}, so that no state can launch an attack with
the expectation that it can wipe out its opponents\' forces and avoid a
devastating retaliation. However, [emerging [nuclear powers might **not
invest** in]{.mark} **expensive** but **survivable capabilities** such
as **[hardened]{.mark} missile [silos]{.mark}**]{.underline} or
submarine based nuclear forces. [[Given]{.underline}]{.mark} this likely
vulnerability, [the **[close proximity]{.mark}** of states in the Middle
East, [and]{.mark} the **very [short flight times]{.mark}**]{.underline}
of ballistic missiles in the region, [any [new]{.mark} nuclear [powers
might]{.mark} be compelled to "**[launch on
warning]{.mark}**"]{.underline} of an attack [[or]{.underline}]{.mark}
even, during a crisis, to [[use]{.mark} their nuclear [forces
**preemptively**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Their [[governments might]{.mark}
also **[delegate launch authority]{.mark}** to **lower-level
commanders**]{.underline}, [[heightening the possibility of
**miscalc**]{.mark}**ulation** and **escalation**]{.underline}.
Moreover, [if early warning systems were not integrated into **robust
c**]{.underline}ommand-and-**[c]{.underline}**ontrol
**[systems]{.underline}**, [[the risk of an]{.mark} **unauthorized** or
[**accidental launch** would **increase**]{.mark}]{.underline} further
[still]{.underline}. And without sophisticated early warning systems, [a
nuclear attack might be **unattributable** or attributed
**incorrectly**]{.underline}. That is, [assuming that the leadership of
a targeted state survived a first strike, it **might not be able** to
accurately determine which nation was **responsible**.]{.underline} And
[this **uncertainty**, when combined with the pressure to **respond
quickly**, would create a **significant risk** that it would **retaliate
against the wrong party**]{.underline}, potentially [[triggering
a]{.mark} **regional [nuclear war.]{.mark}**]{.underline} Most existing
nuclear powers have taken steps to protect their nuclear weapons from
unauthorized use: from closely screening key personnel to developing
technical safety measures, such as permissive action links, which
require special codes before the weapons can be armed. Yet there is no
guarantee that emerging nuclear powers would be willing or able to
implement these measures, creating a significant risk that [their
[governments might **lose control** over]{.mark} the [weapons]{.mark} or
nuclear material and that **nonstate actors** could **gain access to
these items**]{.underline}. [Some states might seek to **mitigate
threats** to their **nuclear arsenals;**]{.underline} for instance, they
might hide their weapons. In that case, however, [a **single
intelligence compromise** could leave their weapons vulnerable to
**attack** or **theft**.]{.underline} Meanwhile, [[states
**outside**]{.underline} [the Mid]{.underline}]{.mark}[dle [East
could]{.mark} also [be a source of **instability**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Throughout the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union were
engaged in a nuclear arms race that other nations were essentially
powerless to influence. [In a multipolar nuclear Middle East, other
[nuclear powers]{.mark} and states with advanced military technology
[could]{.mark} influence]{.underline}---for good or ill---[the military
competition within the region by **[sell]{.mark}**ing or **transferring
[tech]{.mark}nologies** that most **[local actors lack]{.mark}
today:**]{.underline} solid-fuel rocket motors, [enhanced
**missile-guidance systems**]{.underline}, war head miniaturization
technology, early warning systems, air and missile defenses. S[uch
[transfers]{.mark}]{.underline} could stabilize a fragile nuclear
balance if the emerging nuclear powers acquired more survivable arsenals
as a result. But they [[could]{.mark} also [be **highly
destabilizing**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [If]{.underline}, for example, [an
outside power sought to **curry favor** with a potential client state or
**gain influence** with a **prospective ally**, it might **share** with
that state the technology it needed to **enhance the accuracy of its
missiles** and thereby increase its ability to launch a **disarming
first strike** against **any adversary.**]{.underline} The ability of
existing nuclear powers and other technically advanced military states
to shape the emerging nuclear competition in the Middle East could lead
to a new Great Game, with unpredictable consequences.

3\. [No]{.underline}rth [Ko]{.underline}rean [**nukes** would need to be
**secured quickly**]{.underline}.

The [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [would face **many
challenges**]{.underline}, alongside South Korea, [in the event of
collapse in the North]{.underline}. But [securing and destroying nuclear
weapons and associated facilities would be the **top
priority**]{.underline}. A [key part of the strategy to
counter]{.underline} [No]{.underline}rth [Ko]{.underline}rean
**[w]{.underline}**eapons of **[m]{.underline}**ass
**[d]{.underline}**estruction [is to prevent the]{.underline}
**[prolif]{.underline}**eration [of material]{.underline},
[weapons]{.underline}, [and know-how]{.underline} beyond the peninsula
[to **new actors**]{.underline}. In a North Korea collapse scenario, the
United States would likely seek to establish a cordon sanitaire around
the country to prevent nuclear materials from getting out and [into the
hands of]{.underline} other **[rogue actors]{.underline}**,
[or]{.underline} even **[terrorist organizations]{.underline}**.

[No]{.underline}rth [Ko]{.underline}rea is currently [estimated to have
between **20** and **60 nuclear weapons**]{.underline}, a [stockpile of
**75** to **320 kilograms** of **highly enriched uranium**]{.underline},
[**39** relevant **nuclear sites**]{.underline}, [and **49 missile
sites**]{.underline}. Given advancements in its missile technology,
North Korea can hit South Korea, Japan, and even potentially the United
States with nuclear weapons and has threatened to do so on multiple
occasions. Kim or a successor may use nuclear weapons as a last-ditch
effort to deter outside intervention that could ensure and accelerate
the collapse of the regime.

4\. [**China** would take the **lead** **militarily**]{.underline},
whether the United States likes it or not.

One big problem is that U.S. contingency planning does not adequately
account for the role of Chinese forces in a collapse contingency. The
conventional wisdom is that Chinese intervention would largely be
limited to dealing with refugees along its border, and [any actions
taken would be **in** **support** of **No**]{.underline}rth
**[Ko]{.underline}**rea.

But changes in Chinese military capabilities, heightened concerns about
nuclear security, and prioritization of geopolitical competition with
the United States have encouraged China to broaden its thinking in
recent years. Specifically, China would likely undertake an extensive
military intervention with an eye on expanding regional influence if a
major conflict broke out on the Korean Peninsula. Recent Chinese
statements and military training exercises also point to heightened
preparations for intervention.

Moreover, it is [likely that the Chinese military would **reach**
No]{.underline}rth [Ko]{.underline}rean [**nuclear facilities sooner**
than U.S. or So]{.underline}uth [Ko]{.underline}rean troops, [thanks to
China's **geographical proximity**]{.underline} to North Korea, the
vicinity of its troops, [and]{.underline} the [possibility]{.underline}
that [No]{.underline}rth [Ko]{.underline}rean troops [would
exhibit]{.underline} relatively [**low resistance** to Chinese
forces]{.underline}. [China]{.underline} might also [enjoy **early
warning**]{.underline}, allowing for advanced preparation, because the
[shared border provides China with unique opportunities to **collect
intelligence**]{.underline}. All of this points to the need for the
United States to change its planning assumptions to account for the
presence of Chinese troops on the peninsula following any credible signs
of instability in Pyongyang.

5\. The [collapse of the Kim regime would]{.underline} likely [**set
back** **America's position** in Asia]{.underline}.

It is not an exaggeration to say that [the future of the U.S. role in
Asia]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} thus the [**status** of its
**competition** with China for **power** and **influence**]{.underline},
[rides on how the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[responds to **instability** on the **Korean Peninsula**]{.underline}.
Unlike China, the [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates is not a
resident Asian power; it [relies on a network of **alliance
relationships** for **military access**]{.underline}. The
unpredictability of U.S. President Donald Trump's stance on North Korea,
vacillating between "fire and fury" and dramatic praise for Kim, may
create uncertainty among U.S. allies as to how the country would behave
in a confrontation. Similarly, [if the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [does not follow through completely on]{.underline}
its [alliance commitments to So]{.underline}uth [Ko]{.underline}rea,
this could [encourage allies to pursue **alternative arrangements** and
seek **greater accommodation** of China]{.underline}, [**weakening** the
**U.S. position**]{.underline}.

[Instability caused by]{.underline} the [collapse of the Kim regime
would **most certainly** lead to a **civil war** that would involve
the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [as
**So**]{.underline}uth **[Ko]{.underline}**rea's **[ally]{.underline}**.
Hundreds of thousands of [troops]{.underline} would be [needed for
**stability** and **WMD elimination** operations]{.underline} in North
Korea. Such a war would then likely involve deaths in the order of tens
of thousands of people, even millions, and the [choice to detonate any
U.S. nuclear weapons within]{.underline} [No]{.underline}rth
[Ko]{.underline}rea [would bring]{.underline} "**[hellish
results]{.underline}**," as the security studies expert Barry Posen has
argued. The [drain of a **major war** on the **Korean Peninsula** would
be **cataclysmic** for U.S. resourcing of the **great-power
competition** with China in other areas]{.underline} and arenas.

In short, while many may cheer at the sign of political troubles in
North Korea, [the situation is complicated]{.underline}.
[U.S.]{.underline} policymakers [would]{.underline} almost [certainly
face a **deck stacked against them** if regime instability hits
Pyongyang]{.underline}. It would take once-in-a-generation leadership to
create the U.S. statecraft that would navigate the United States safely
through a potential crisis.

News reports indicate that [No]{.underline}rth [Ko]{.underline}rea has
begun to [move fuel rods containing]{.underline} six bombs' worth of
**[plutonium]{.underline}** from its facility at Yongbyon. For eight
years, since 1994, that plutonium has been stored at Yongbyon where it
could be seen by on-site inspectors and, if necessary, entombed by an
airstrike of precision bombs. Now it is being trucked away, perhaps to
one of North Korea's many caves, where it will be difficult to find or
destroy.

This [development undermines global **nonprolif**]{.underline}eration
**[efforts]{.underline}** that have been successful for decades, [and
represents an **imminent danger** to the **security** of the
**region**]{.underline}. Even more, [in an age of terrorism it
poses]{.underline} the [additional specter of putting nuclear weapons
into the hands of parties **even more threatening** than]{.underline}
the [No]{.underline}rth [Ko]{.underline}rean government. North Korea has
few cash-generating exports other than ballistic missiles. Now nuclear
weapons or fissile material could take their place in its shopping
catalogue. Or [No]{.underline}rth [Ko]{.underline}rea's [government
might **collapse**]{.underline}, [**losing control** of the nukes in the
process]{.underline}. While hijacked airlines and anthrax-dusted letters
are a dangerous threat to civilized society, it would change the way
Americans were forced to live if it [became]{.underline} [an
**ever-present possibility** that a city could **disappear** in a
**mushroom cloud**]{.underline}

North Korea has not been allowed to reprocess nuclear fuel rods to
obtain weapons plutonium since 1989. In that period, [No]{.underline}rth
[Ko]{.underline}rea [obtained a **quantity** of **plutonium** that it
did **not** **declare honestly**]{.underline} to the IAEA, as it was
required to do. How much is uncertain, but estimates range as high as
two bombs' worth. Whether it has had a bomb or two for the past 15 years
is not known, but for sure it is now only a few months away from
obtaining six bombs. The North Koreans might reckon that's enough to
sell some and have some left over to threaten the U.S. and its allies,
South Korea and Japan.

[No]{.underline}rth [Ko]{.underline}rea also admitted last October that
it aims to [produce]{.underline} the [other metal from which nuclear
weapons can be made-**uranium**]{.underline}. It will be years, however,
before that effort produces anything like the amount of fissile material
now being trucked from Yongbyon. The material at Yongbyon is the
immediate threat.

[This is the **way a** **nuclear war begins**]{.underline}.

[Simulations of a [war on]{.mark} the [Korean
peninsula]{.mark}]{.underline} usually [start with a]{.underline}
relatively [minor incident at the]{.underline}
**[d]{.underline}**e**[m]{.underline}**ilitarized **[z]{.underline}**one
between South Korea and its hostile northern neighbor, [or a provocation
that develops into a conventional war and then
[escalates]{.mark}]{.underline}.

President Trump's threatening posture toward North Korea --- most
recently exhibited at the United Nations, where he warned that the U.S.
could "totally destroy" the country --- has prompted military
strategists to examine what would actually happen if a war broke out.

The scenarios are a sobering corrective to the notion that North Korea's
nuclear capacity could be taken out in a single strike, or that the
regime would prove as fragile as that of Saddam Hussein in Iraq or
Moammar Kadafi in Libya.

"Too many Americans have the view that it would be like the invasion of
Iraq or Afghanistan, or like combat operations in Libya or Syria, but it
wouldn't remotely resemble that,'' said Rob Givens, a retired Air Force
brigadier general who spent four years stationed on the Korean
peninsula.

And that is before the North Koreans turn to nuclear weapons. "[There is
only **one way** that this war ends]{.underline}," Givens said. "[With
No]{.underline}rth [Ko]{.underline}rea's [defeat]{.underline} --- **[but
at what cost]{.underline}**?"

James Stavridis, a retired Navy admiral and dean of the Fletcher School
of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, said the horrific war many
have long feared with North Korea is a distinct possibility. He puts the
chances of conventional conflict with North Korea at 50-50 and the
chances of nuclear war at 10%.

"[We are **[closer to]{.mark} a [nuc]{.mark}lear [exchange than]{.mark}
we have been** at [any time]{.mark} in the world's history]{.underline}
with the single exception of the Cuban missile crisis,'' Stavridis said.

The [[conflict]{.underline}]{.mark} that Stavridis envisions [might
[start with]{.mark}]{.underline} North Korean leader
[[Kim]{.underline}]{.mark} Jong Un [[launching]{.mark} a
[missile]{.mark} that lands]{.underline} on or [[near
**Guam**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The [[U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [then
moves **aircraft carrier strike groups** within range of the peninsula
and [retaliates with]{.mark} an **[airstrike]{.mark}** on a coastal
launch facility]{.underline}, perhaps using a Tomahawk cruise missile
--- similar to the attack the U.S. launched to punish Syria for its use
of chemical weapons.

The [strike is intended as a message]{.underline}, not an invitation to
all-out war. [But [Kim]{.mark}]{.underline}, unlike Syria's Bashar
Assad, [is [**unlikely** to **sit idly by**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

"[He has to react]{.underline}. [He knows that [if]{.mark} there is a
military strike and [he does]{.mark} [nothing]{.mark} about
it]{.underline}, [they've called his bluff and **the [game]{.mark} is
[all over for]{.mark} [him]{.mark}**]{.underline},'' said Sue Mi Terry,
a former CIA analyst on North Korea.

[[No]{.underline}]{.mark}rth [[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}rea might [respond
by **[lobbing]{.mark}**]{.underline} a few [**[artillery
shells]{.mark}** [toward]{.mark}]{.underline} the 35,000 [[U.S.
troops]{.underline}]{.mark} currently stationed [[in]{.mark}
[So]{.mark}]{.underline}uth [[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}rea.

North Korea has approximately 11,000 conventional artillery pieces dug
into the mountains north of the demilitarized zone. Although much of the
equipment dates from the Soviet era, it is in excellent working order
and well-protected from drone strikes and airstrikes because it is
designed to be rolled in and out from tunnels in the mountains.

The [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [would try to take
out]{.underline} the [artillery with drones and airstrikes]{.underline},
[but **that would take days**]{.underline}, [in which time]{.underline}
the [[No]{.underline}]{.mark}rth [[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}reans
[would]{.underline} probably [[launch]{.mark} a **[punishing
barrage]{.mark}** aimed [at **Seoul**]{.mark}]{.underline} and its
population of 25 million.

As the war escalates, the [No]{.underline}rth [Ko]{.underline}reans

**[[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}**rean [[and **U.S. military
bases**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The Pentagon has estimated the potential number of dead in South Korea
at 20,000 each day, Givens said. And that is before the North Koreans
turn to nuclear weapons.

Although North Korea has successfully tested an intercontinental
ballistic missile and conducted six nuclear tests, the technologies have
not yet been married together. That means that though the West Coast of
the U.S. now appears to be within range of North Korea's missiles, it is
unlikely that Pyongyang could credibly target the mainland United States
with a fully functioning nuclear weapon at this stage.

On the other hand, [a nuclear device could be smuggled into a container
port]{.underline} [or dropped from an airplane]{.underline}, perhaps
[near]{.underline} one of the [**U.S. bases** in Asia]{.underline}.

"[[In]{.mark} an **all-out [conquest]{.mark}** [for **regime
survival**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [**[they will come after the]{.mark}**
**[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates. They
are not going to win, but they will try --- I guarantee that,'' Givens
said.

The paradox with North Korea is that its weakness is what makes it so
dangerous --- and why it is difficult to make comparisons with the Cold
War period, when fears of mutually assured destruction deterred war with
the Soviet Union.

[[If Kim thinks]{.mark} his [regime]{.mark} is
[collapsing]{.mark}]{.underline}, many of those who have long studied
the inscrutable leader believe, [he would be [**inclined** to
**reach**]{.mark} [for]{.mark} the **[nucl]{.mark}ear [option]{.mark}**
in order [to **take down everyone**]{.mark} **else** [with
him]{.mark}]{.underline} --- **[a last lash of the dragon's
tail]{.underline}**.

"The North Koreans are in a weak position. They can't sustain a
protracted conventional war. They would have to reach for their weapons
of mass destruction early on,'' said Daniel Pinkston, a former military
translator who now teaches defense strategy in South Korea.

The [very notion of **trying** to **take out** No]{.underline}rth
[Ko]{.underline}rea's [nuclear weapons]{.underline}, he added, "[has a
**high likelihood** that you are going to **unleash the very thing**
that you are **trying to prevent**]{.underline}.''

Kim Jong Il, father of the current leader, is widely reported to have
said, "I would destroy the world or take the world with me before
accepting defeat on the battlefield."

The oft-cited [statistics about No]{.underline}rth [Ko]{.underline}rea's
[military are **formidable**]{.underline}: [1.2 million
soldiers]{.underline} in the fourth-largest ground army in the world,
among them more than [100,000 **special forces** trained to infiltrate
So]{.underline}uth [Ko]{.underline}rea. Although its military hardware
dates back to the Soviet era, [No]{.underline}rth [Ko]{.underline}rea
[has **more tanks** than the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
(3,500 compared with 2,381) [and more **artillery pieces**]{.underline}
than China. Its **[nuclear fissile material]{.underline}** is [enough
for least 12 **nuclear weapons**]{.underline}, possibly [as many as
**60**]{.underline}, depending on their size. (According to the Arms
Control Assn., the U.S. has 1,411 strategic nuclear warheads.)

"The North Korean army is still inferior in every aspect of their
operations, but they have massive artillery and missile capability, very
large special forces and covert operations and submarines,'' said
Anthony Cordesman of the Washington-based Center for Strategic and
International Studies and author of a study of the military balance in
Asia.

No doubt, a replay of the Korean War in the 21st century would be
quicker than the 1950-to-1953 Korean War, a slog through snow-choked
mountains that killed nearly 2 million people and left the demarcation
line between North and South Korea essentially in the same place where
it had started.

But despite the mechanized, high-technology weapons deployed in
modern-day warfare, a new Korean War could be as drawn-out and messy as
the earlier one.

"A war today would certainly involve a lot of technology, more precise
and lethal systems than the last war, but you need to be very, very
careful or you could be fighting in precisely those same mountains,''
Cordesman said.

One of the unpredictable factors charting the course of a new Korean War
is whether China would enter the war to save its communist ally.

The Global Times, a newspaper that often expresses Chinese government
views, editorialized last month that China would not help North Korea if
the U.S. retaliated against a North Korean missile attack. However,
it [[also
warned]{.underline}](https://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1060791.shtml) that
"if the U.S. and South Korea carry out strikes and try to overthrow the
North Korean regime and change the political pattern of the Korean
peninsula, China will prevent them from doing so."

Most military strategists don't expect the current Chinese government
under Xi Jinping to send its troops cross the Yalu River as Mao Tse-tung
did in 1950. But Beijing could conduct airstrikes to prop up the
government in Pyongyang, in much the way that Russia has come to the aid
of Syria's Assad. The Chinese also might intervene to call for a peace
deal that would end up keeping Kim in power.

The [aftermath of a new **Korean War**]{.underline}, even a conventional
war, [could be **as messy** as the **conflict itself**]{.underline}.

[Removal of Kim could leave the country with a **power vacuum** and no
one clearly in charge]{.underline}. "You might [have a **legitimacy
competition** in No]{.underline}rth [Ko]{.underline}rea where different
actions are backed by different parties,'' said Scott Snyder of the
Council on Foreign Relations. Although [No]{.underline}rth
[Ko]{.underline}rea has an ethnically homogenous population --- no rival
ethnic factions competing for dominance --- it has often been [torn by
**regional divisions** and could **easily disintegrate** in the way that
countries such as **Iraq** and **Libya** did]{.underline} after the fall
of dictators.

"I [would not rule out]{.underline} the [possibility]{.underline} that
[No]{.underline}rth [Ko]{.underline}rea's future [could look a lot like
**Syria**]{.underline},'' Snyder said. "[No]{.underline}rth

President Biden and his team will have a plethora of urgent issues to
address upon taking office, above all the pandemic, economic recovery
and race relations. Yet chances are good that, just as in past
presidential transitions, North Korea will find a way to put itself on
the front burner. In the past, the [Kim regime drew attention to itself
with provocations involving missiles and nuclear tests]{.underline}, and
that could be the case in 2021 as well. Yet [Biden and his team should
be on their guard against **another form** of **No**]{.underline}rth
**[Ko]{.underline}**rea **[crisis]{.underline}** --- [one involving a
catastrophic mix of **covid**]{.underline}-19, [**nuclear weapons** and
a **collapsing economy**]{.underline}.

North Korean leader [Kim]{.underline} Jong Un's [speech at the
**W**orkers' **P**arty **C**ongress]{.underline} earlier this month
[made]{.underline} pretty [clear that **denuclearization** is **not in
the cards**]{.underline} for the Biden administration. On the contrary,
[Kim laid out a]{.underline} pretty [**ambitious agenda** for weapons
modernization including **hypersonic missiles**]{.underline},
[solid-fuel **i**]{.underline}nter**[c]{.underline}**ontinental
**[b]{.underline}**allistic
**[m]{.underline}**issile**[s]{.underline}**, **[u]{.underline}**nmanned
**[a]{.underline}**erial **v**ehicle**[s]{.underline}**,
**[nuclear]{.underline}**-[powered **submarines**]{.underline} capable
of launching ballistic missiles, [and **tactical nuclear**
**weapons**]{.underline}. Kim also said he wants to develop ICBMs with
precision targeting up to nearly 10,000 miles, which would more than
cover the continental United States.

And if Kim gets to work early, Biden could soon find himself confronting
missile provocations --- just as he did as vice president, when North
Korea launched a rocket and exploded a nuclear device soon after
President Barack Obama took office.

But there's a difference this time. [Kim]{.underline} has
[issued]{.underline} this latest round of [threats amid a raging global
pandemic]{.underline} that has shut down the country and ~~crippled~~
\[wrecked\] an already weak economy. [This could become the **real
source of crisis**]{.underline}. Kim should fear U.S. military power far
less than the prospect of a pandemic raging across a virtually
nonexistent public health infrastructure. While [No]{.underline}rth
[Ko]{.underline}rea still claims there are no covid-19 cases in the
country, it [has completely locked down its borders]{.underline}, not
unlike the lockdowns it imposed in response to the Ebola outbreak in
West Africa in 2014 and SARS in 2003. The [economy has **suffered
dearly** as a result]{.underline}, registering an economic downturn in
2020 comparable to the Great Famine in the 1990s, when 10 percent of the
population perished.

[Normally]{.underline}, [China and So]{.underline}uth
[Ko]{.underline}rea [would **help out**]{.underline}, [but]{.underline}
the [No]{.underline}rth [Ko]{.underline}reans have [closed
off]{.underline} almost **[all border trade]{.underline}** for fear of
the virus entering the country. Year-on-year [trade with
China]{.underline}, far and away [the North's leading trade
partner]{.underline}, [is **down** more than **70
percent**]{.underline}. Indeed, when a disturbed South Korean government
official tried to defect to the North last year, the North Korean
military not only shot him but also burned the body to avoid any virus
transmission.

[Vaccines are a **long way off**]{.underline}. [So]{.underline}uth
[Ko]{.underline}rea, [the most likely source]{.underline}, [does not
have them yet and isn't likely to get any]{.underline} earlier than
April. [China has its own problems with the new]{.underline} virus
[variant]{.underline}, [and its **vaccine diplomacy** is focused on
**Africa** and **Latin America**]{.underline}.

[All this means **there is no end in sight**]{.underline}. Our
independent study found that in response to the MERS virus in 2015,
North Korea stayed locked down for twice the amount of time as South
Korea, where the outbreak happened. [Can the No]{.underline}rth
[Ko]{.underline}rean [economy]{.underline} really [**survive** being
**shut down** for another year]{.underline} or longer? **[I don't think
so]{.underline}**.

[No]{.underline}rth [Ko]{.underline}rea [may respond]{.underline} to
this predicament [by trying to take control of]{.underline} the
burgeoning [private markets]{.underline} inside of the country. The
recent party congress suggests that such measures might include forcing
hard-working North Korean citizens to hand over precious dollars,
renminbi and euros gotten through black markets in return for worthless
North Korean won.

Our research interviewing North Korean defectors suggests that [most
social resistance against the iron hand of the state has taken place
whenever the government has attempted **anti-market
activities**]{.underline} such as currency reform, extraordinary taxes
or market shutdowns. [Should the regime]{.underline} become desperate
enough to [undertake such measures]{.underline}, [it could find itself
confronting **congregations** of **angry North Koreans**]{.underline}
that could in turn become covid-19 superspreader events, compounding the
crisis.

A [breakdown of such order could mean that the government]{.underline}
in Pyongyang [may be tempted to **lash out militarily** at **external
enemies** to justify **consolidating control** at home through **brutal
crackdowns**]{.underline}. In the worst case, the [combination of
disease and a deteriorating economy could lead to **internal chaos**
that]{.underline} might [endanger **government control** over its
**nuclear arsenal**]{.underline}. [A **loose-nukes crisis** could end up
making a few missile launches look **tame**]{.underline}.

All these variables mean that the new [U.S.]{.underline} administration
[could face a **No**]{.underline}rth **[Ko]{.underline}**rean
[**crisis** **unlike any** confronting the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [before]{.underline}. Biden would be well-advised
to keep a close watch.

North Korea\'s Kim Jong Un has bought his way in to talks with China\'s
President Xi Jinping, South Korea\'s President Moon Jae-in, and US
President Donald Trump with a commitment to [denuclearize]{.underline}
his [country]{.underline} --- but [doing so could open up the world to
the **tremendous risk** of **loose nukes** and **loose nuclear
scientists**]{.underline}.

Though Kim has repeatedly vowed to rid his country of nuclear weapons,
the promises remain totally one-sided as no one knows how many, or
where, North Korea\'s nuclear arsenal is.

Kim reportedly sent a message to Trump saying he\'d accept
denuclearization verification and intensive inspection by international
inspectors with the International Atomic Energy Agency, the same agency
that supervises the Iran deal

But to do that, Kim would have to provide a list of nuclear sites to the
inspectors. It will be a major challenge for the outside world to take
his word for it when he announces the sites, or to scour the country for
additional sites.

In the past, North Korea has agreed to international inspections, but
backed out when it came time to actually scrutinize the programs.

As a result of North Korea\'s secretiveness, it may have unaccounted for
nuclear weapons floating around even after work towards denuclearization
begins.

Furthermore, former US Senators Sam Nunn and Richard Lugar, who served a
pivotal role in securing the loose nuclear weapons after the fall of the
Soviet Union in 1991, write in the Washington Post that \"thousands of
North Korean scientists and engineers\" are \"now employed in making
weapons of mass destruction.\"

[If No]{.underline}rth [Ko]{.underline}rea\'s [weapons program

5-9-2022, accessed on 7-20-2022, BBC, "From handshakes to hostilities:
How dangerous is the situation in North Korea?",
[[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-61331859]{.underline}](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-61331859),
HBisevac)

Kim Jong-un is testing North Korea\'s weapons with renewed urgency, as
South Korea prepares to inaugurate a new, hard-line president. [After
years of **stalemate**]{.underline}, [following **failed nuclear
talks**]{.underline}, [**tensions** on the **Korean peninsula** are
**rising**]{.underline}.

\"I thought about getting an axe, but I decided it would be too
difficult to carry, so I settled for a knife.\"

Sitting in a dimly-lit cocktail bar, late one night, Jenn recounts her
detailed escape plan. As a South Korean, living in Seoul, she knew
exactly what she would do if the North attacked. First came the weapons,
then two motorbikes: one for her, the other for her brother. Their
parents would ride on the back. This way they could cross the city\'s
river quickly, before the North Koreans bombed the bridges, and
hopefully make it to the coast before the port was destroyed. One
evening she and her brother sat and mapped their route, agreeing to tie
ribbons to the trees should they be separated.

This was five years ago. At the time, North Korea was furiously testing
missiles that could, in theory, deliver nuclear bombs to the United
States, and its then President Donald Tru mp was threatening to respond
with \"fire and fury\". Jenn admits she was more worried than most. But
nonetheless, this was the closest many South Koreans felt they had come
to war since fighting with North Korea ended almost 70 years ago.

Then something remarkable happened. [So]{.underline}uth
[Ko]{.underline}rea\'s [newly-elected president]{.underline} at the
time, [Moon Jae-in]{.underline}, convinced Mr Trump to meet Kim Jong-un.
It was the first time a sitting US president had ever met the leader of
North Korea. A flurry of historic summits followed,
[spark]{.underline}ing [hope that the North might just agree to give up
its nuclear weapons]{.underline}, [and the two Koreas would make
peace]{.underline}.

Excitement fizzed as President Moon, the son of North Korean refugees,
arrived in the Capital Pyongyang and stepped out into a packed stadium,
grasping the hand of his adversary. The audience didn\'t know what to
do, recalls Prof Moon Chung-in, the president\'s advisor at the time.
They had been told this man was their enemy, yet here he was on their
soil, proposing peace. Suddenly, the 150,000 North Korean spectators
erupted in raucous applause. \"It was amazing to watch, it was a very
moving moment for me,\" he says.

But [as]{.underline} President [Moon leaves office]{.underline}, [the
**hopes** of that year **lie in tatters**]{.underline}.
[When]{.underline} a [nuclear deal between]{.underline} the
[U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and]{.underline}
[No]{.underline}rth [Ko]{.underline}rea [collapsed]{.underline} in 2019,
[**so did talks** between the **Koreas**]{.underline}. There [has been a
**stalemate ever since**]{.underline}. Meanwhile [No]{.underline}rth
[Ko]{.underline}rea has [continued to develop its]{.underline}
**[w]{.underline}**eapons of **[m]{.underline}**ass
**[d]{.underline}**estruction [and]{.underline} is once again [testing
them with **alarming frequency**]{.underline}. Only this time, the
pandemic and now the war in Ukraine mean the eyes of the world have been
focused elsewhere.

Asked if the government failed, Prof Moon Chung-in is defensive. \"No, I
don\'t think so! Was there war?\" He reasons that for five years the
Moon government kept the peace during one of the biggest crises in
inter-Korean relations. It also showed what incentives would get North
Korea to the negotiating table. The problem, he believes, is that North
Korean negotiators returned empty-handed, in what was a great
embarrassment for the regime, and almost certainly a punishable offence.

President Moon tried everything he could to coax the North Koreans back
to talks, but in doing so he has been accused of appeasing one of the
world\'s most brutal dictators.

\"When I saw those pictures of them with their arms around each other
laughing, it sent shivers down my back,\" remembers Hanna Song, from her
office in downtown Seoul. Her organisation, the Database Centre for
North Korean Human Rights, has been tracking human rights violations in
North Korea for more than two decades. The last few years have not been
easy.

Human rights are Kim Jong-un\'s Achilles\' heel, Hanna explains. She
says that in an effort to stop the North Korean leader from feeling
uncomfortable, President Moon \"swept them under the rug\".

Hanna\'s organisation interviews North Korean escapees at Hanawon, the
resettlement centre where they live for their first three months in the
country. Their testimonies play a vital role in documenting human rights
abuses. But two years ago, the South Korean government cut off their
access to the centre, meaning they could no longer gather their
evidence. Then Hanna started hearing from escapees that they were being
pressured not to speak publicly about their experiences in North Korea.
Some received calls from the local policemen assigned to help them
assimilate. \"Are you sure it\'s wise to be doing this?\" they asked.

Hanna tried challenging the government over the missing information.
\"What are you going to do when there is this gap in evidence, just
because you wanted to make sure Kim Jong-un wasn\'t being shamed in
front of the international community?\" she would ask, to little
response.

\"What\'s happening in Ukraine is horrendous,\" Hanna concludes, \"but
at least we know.\"

Frighteningly little is known about the current situation in North
Korea. Its self-imposed coronavirus border closure has stopped people,
and therefore information, from leaving. What is clear is that Kim
Jong-un has continued developing nuclear weapons, in spite of numerous
international sanctions designed to stop him from doing so. His weapons
are becoming more sophisticated and dangerous. In March, the regime
tested its first intercontinental ballistic missile for the first time
since the summits of 2018 began, and it flew further and for longer than
any of its previously tested missiles.

But **[the hugs and handshakes are over]{.underline}**.
[So]{.underline}uth [Ko]{.underline}rea has [elected a new]{.underline},
**[tough-talking President]{.underline}**, a former prosecutor with no
prior political experience. In a recent interview [Yoon Suk-yeol
described No]{.underline}rth [Ko]{.underline}rea [as the]{.underline}
\"**[main enemy]{.underline}**\" [of the South and has promised to take
a **hard-line approach** to its **military escalations**]{.underline}.

He will only talk to his neighbour, he has said, if North Korea shows it
is serious about denuclearisation. But most experts now agree that
[No]{.underline}rth [Ko]{.underline}rea [has **zero intention** of
giving up its nuclear weapons]{.underline}. It had reached this
conclusion long before the war in Ukraine highlighted the perils of
relinquishing such weapons, though this certainly has not helped. This
gives Mr Yoon\'s strategy \"zero chance of working\" according to Chris
Green, a consultant for the International Crisis Group, an organisation
working to prevent wars.

During his campaign, Mr Yoon went as far as to say he would a launch a
pre-emptive strike on North Korea, to destroy its weapons, if there were
signs the North was about to mount an attack. This has long been part of
South Korea\'s defence strategy, but it is rarely uttered out loud as it
is a sure-fire way to enrage the North - which it did. Last month North
Korea paraded its missiles through the streets, in its latest attempted
show of strength. Kim Jong-un, dressed in a white military uniform,
delivered a blistering warning: any hostile force that threatened North
Korea, would \"cease to exist\". This was interpreted, at least in part,
as a warning to the new South Korean president.

The [North has been developing an array of short-range missiles
which]{.underline}, for the first time last month, it [hinted could be
used to carry tactical nukes]{.underline} - the sort which could be used
[**against** **So**]{.underline}uth **[Ko]{.underline}**rea in a
conventional war. There are now signs it is about to test one of these
nuclear bombs.

But Chris Green still believes North Korea\'s main goal is survival.
\"If it were to use a nuclear weapon, under any circumstance, it would
spell the end of the regime, and North Korea knows that,\" he explains.
Instead, Mr Green predicts an arms race between the North and South,
with both building up their arsenal and testing them more frequently.
These actions shouldn\'t lead to war, but they could lead to a
miscalculation by either side. That is the biggest danger at the moment,
he thinks.

Crouched around a smoking barbeque, down a back alley in Seoul, Lee
Geon-il clinks glasses with his friends and they knock back their first
soju of the night. \"Does it taste sweet yet?\" he jokes, referring to
the Korean saying that the spirit turns sweet after a hard day or a hard
life.

\"Anything I drink at this point will be sweet,\" Lee Si-yeol replies.
Typically, South Koreans don\'t pay much attention to North Korea,
comforted by a belief that the United States is its real target. But
Si-yeol is also about to start his compulsory military service, and as
tension on the peninsula creeps up, he is struggling to shake his fear.
\"I know I\'m unusual, but it does concern me when Kim Jong-un shoots a
missile,\" he says. \"I do worry this new hard-line policy we are
adopting might provoke some sort of conflict.\"

Lee Geon-il worries too. He didn\'t use to, he says, but the war in
Ukraine has caused him to think the same could happen here. He will be
an officer and admits he cannot imagine having to lead his men in an
actual war. But he supports the new president. \"We need to respond
strongly to them saying [they will use nuclear weapons]{.underline},
[the threat is so close]{.underline}.\"

As Prof Moon Chung-in stands overlooking the presidential office, he
reflects on their failed diplomacy. \"The future is bleak,\" he
concludes. \"I can\'t see a breakthrough, not in my lifetime. We missed
our opportunity.\"

There is unease in Seoul about what is coming, as [Nor]{.underline}th
[Ko]{.underline}rea [inevitably **tests the limits** of the new
government and tries to **claw its way back** up the **international
agenda**]{.underline}. \"I am bracing myself,\" a former South Korean
Lieutenant General admitted, in private.

The world might be looking elsewhere, but [No]{.underline}rth
[Ko]{.underline}rea is [getting **harder** to **ignore**]{.underline}.

[Is No]{.underline}rth [Ko]{.underline}rea [on the brink of
**collapse**]{.underline}? **[Perhaps]{.underline}**. Years of
[**[economic]{.mark} [mismanagement]{.mark}** [exacerbated by]{.mark}
hulking international **[sanctions]{.mark}**]{.underline} have [made it
[difficult for]{.mark} [Kim]{.mark}]{.underline} Jong-un [[to **make
ends meet**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The [country is [facing]{.mark} a
**[food crunch]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [**[Energy]{.mark}** has long
been [in **short supply**]{.mark}]{.underline}. And while North Korea
claims to have shut out Covid-19 for the past 18 months, it is more
likely that the pandemic's ravages have simply gone unreported and
unaddressed.

It is [[feasible that]{.mark} economic [distress]{.mark}]{.underline}
and miserable living conditions [will combine with a major]{.underline}
public health [crisis to [send]{.mark} [No]{.mark}]{.underline}rth
[[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}rea **[[over the
edge]{.underline}]{.mark}**---if not a popular revolt, then perhaps a
split in the ruling elite that brings about the regime's downfall. But
North Korea's leaders have weathered tempestuous political storms before
and there is every reason to believe that they will do so again,
especially with backing from Beijing.

The reality is that US-based analysts have no way of knowing what is
happening inside North Korea right now, let alone what will happen in
the future. The only course of action is to plan for both outcomes:
regime collapse, to be sure, but also the long-term survival of a
repressive, nuclear-armed government in Pyongyang with Kim at its head.

[Imagining [No]{.mark}]{.underline}rth [[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}rea's
[[collapse]{.mark} is a **[grim]{.mark} business**]{.underline}. Who
would deliver essential humanitarian aid to the country's 25 million
impoverished citizens? How many **[[refugees]{.underline}]{.mark}**
could be [expected to cross [into]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[[So]{.underline}]{.mark}**uth **[[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}**rea [[and
China]{.underline}]{.mark}? Might [regime **loyalists**]{.underline},
**[military [hardliners]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [and ideological zealots
[engage in **violence**]{.mark} [against]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[[So]{.underline}]{.mark}**uth **[[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}**rea,
**[[Japan]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [the **[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates, or the segments of their own
population? [What would be the fate of No]{.underline}rth
[Ko]{.underline}rea's [**nuclear** **arsenal**]{.underline}?

These weighty questions need to be revisited on a regular basis. Even
so, Washington must also prepare for the more likely scenario that Kim
Jong-un will be in power for decades to come. Indeed, even a brief
consideration of a North Korean collapse should be enough to demonstrate
that the United States has at least some interest in helping the regime
to avoid a catastrophic implosion. The current leaders of North Korea
are remorseless killers, but this does not mean that the regime's sudden
disappearance would bring relief.

On the contrary, [[state failure]{.mark} in]{.underline}
[No]{.underline}rth [Ko]{.underline}rea [would be a]{.underline}
humanitarian catastrophe and a **[[geopolitical
nightmare]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [No matter how good the
planning]{.underline}, the [[**logistical challenges** of
avoiding]{.mark} **[famine]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} **[rampant]{.mark}
[disease]{.mark}** would almost certainly be
**[insurmountable]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the short term. Establishing
a new government would be close to intractable. The international
community has no allies inside North Korea; there is no organized
opposition or government-in-exile waiting to assume power.

What is more, [[Beijing]{.mark} almost certainly [has]{.mark} its own
[plans]{.mark} [for]{.mark} handling [**state failure** across]{.mark}
the **[Yalu]{.mark}** [and **Tumen**
rivers]{.mark}]{.underline}---[plans that do not involve **U.S.
interference** or prompt reunification with]{.underline}
**[So]{.underline}**uth **[Ko]{.underline}**rea. If the great powers
could not agree on how to respond to a crisis in North Korea, it would
be ordinary citizens bearing the brunt of their disagreements.

A [better]{.underline} and more humane [regime in]{.underline}
[No]{.underline}rth [Ko]{.underline}rea [is something to wish
for]{.underline}. **[State collapse is not]{.underline}**. As
counterintuitive as it might sound, [[people]{.underline}]{.mark} in the
United States [had [better hope]{.mark} that the [Kim]{.mark} regime
[hangs on a **while longer**]{.mark}]{.underline}, at least until such a
time as it can be ushered out of existence in a somewhat managed
fashion.

#### NoKo refugee crisis causes [civil wars]{.underline}. 

Steve **Mollman, 17** (Steve Mollman, Asia correspondent for WSJ and
Wired, 5-17-2017, accessed on 7-20-2022, Quartz, "It's time to start
considering what a North Korean refugee crisis would look like",

HBisevac) \*\*edited for ableist language\*\*

There's an [undeveloped strip of land on the Korean
peninsula]{.underline} where nature thrives, but wild animals
occasionally explode. [Walking across it would be a **bad
idea**]{.underline}.

[Known as the **[d]{.mark}**e**[m]{.mark}**ilitarized
**[z]{.mark}**one]{.underline} (DMZ), it [divides So]{.underline}uth
[Ko]{.underline}rea [and No]{.underline}rth [Ko]{.underline}rea, nations
that technically have been at war since the 1950s. Running 240 km (150
miles) across the Korean peninsula, and measuring about 4 km (2.5 miles)
wide, [it is **[heavily guarded]{.mark}** by two of the world's
**largest militaries**]{.underline}, strewn with landmines, and arguably
the most fortified border on the planet.

If you want to flee North Korea, this is not your recommended route. It
makes much more sense to head north instead toward China, where the Yalu
and Tumen rivers straddle Mount Paektu to create a 1,420-km (880-mile)
border. The Yalu is the deeper of the two rivers, but neither is all
that hard to get across. In the winter, both can freeze over.

There's been a lot of hand-wringing of late over North Korea and its
~~erratic~~ leader Kim Jong-un, with much of the world rightly alarmed
over its ongoing tests of missiles and nuclear bombs---including a
missile test on May 14. There's been hope that China will apply more
economic pressure against North Korea to help bring about a change.

But it's [**impossible** to game out scenarios for the region without
taking into account the **reality** of]{.underline}
**[[No]{.underline}]{.mark}**rth **[[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}**rea's
**[[borders]{.underline}]{.mark}**. For most of the 25 million people
contained within them, life is already harsh. Should central authority
be replaced by civil war and competing factions hoarding resources, it
[would [get]{.mark} even [worse]{.mark}]{.underline},
[[causing]{.underline}]{.mark} potentially [[**millions** of]{.mark}
**desperate**]{.underline} ([and]{.underline} in many cases
**[starving]{.underline}**) [[people to]{.mark} [head **straight for
China**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Today Beijing considers fleeing North Koreans "economic migrants,"
meaning it doesn't have to offer them protections it agreed to under the
UN's 1951 Refugee Convention. It routinely returns North Koreans to
their country, knowing that many will be tortured or executed, in part
because Beijing worries that a more lenient stance might only encourage
more North Koreans to cross the border.

Of course, [[in]{.mark} a [crisis]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[they'll
cross]{.mark} the [border]{.mark}]{.underline} in any case, [in numbers
that will **draw the world's attention**]{.underline}. [It would
[be]{.mark} a **[humanitarian disaster]{.mark}** of **epic
proportions**]{.underline}, and the brunt of it would be shouldered by
China---similar to Turkey's role in handling the refugee crisis
originating in neighboring Syria. While it remains to be seen how
closely Beijing will work with the US and others in addressing North
Korea, it's clear that [the potential for mass migration directly into
China]{.underline} will be a **[key consideration]{.underline}** in how
it approaches the problem.

Logistical challenge

China does have field experience with refugee crises. In 2009, over
30,000 refugees from Myanmar's Kokang region flooded into the southern
Yunnan province, escaping the fighting between government troops and
local rebels. Many of them were ethnic Chinese who spoke Mandarin, which
no doubt helped matters. China won moderate praise from the
international community for providing food, emergency shelter, and
medical care to the refugees.

"You could really see China's emergency-response system kicking in, and
see how China might deal with North Korea," says Carla Park Freeman,
director of the Foreign Policy Institute at the Johns Hopkins School of
Advanced International Studies in Washington DC.

The fighting in Kokang flared up again in March, sending more refugees
China's way, and giving the country further experience in what might be
a warm-up exercise for a far larger crisis in the northeast.

[[In]{.mark} the [event of]{.mark} a No]{.underline}rth
[Ko]{.underline}rean **[[refugee crisis]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the
[[logistical challenge]{.mark} will require new solutions from
[China]{.mark}]{.underline}. Besides trying to fortify its border, it
[might [seize control]{.mark} [of]{.mark}]{.underline} some
[[No]{.underline}]{.mark}rth [[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}rean
[[territory]{.underline}]{.mark} in order [to create a **buffer
zone**]{.underline}, in which case it would probably first try to get
approval from the international community.

"I think China would look for some kind of UN authorization before
moving in," says Freeman. But, she adds, "In a crisis, [[China
would]{.mark} [move]{.mark}]{.underline} very, [**very
[quickly]{.mark}** to try to secure its borders with No]{.underline}rth
[Ko]{.underline}rea, [and [try to]{.mark} [keep]{.mark}]{.underline} the
North Koreans [[fleeing on]{.mark} the [Korean side]{.mark} of the
border]{.underline}, [and try to **manage them there**]{.underline}."

But [keeping migrants hemmed in w[ould be **no easy
task**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Nor would supporting Chinese troops trying
to secure the]{.underline} long [border]{.underline}.

"[[Sustainability]{.mark} at blocking the border would be a [huge
challenge]{.mark}]{.underline}---**[food]{.underline}**,
**[material]{.underline}**, **[shelter]{.underline}** for the troops,"
notes Bob Collins, a former US Defense Department analyst with nearly 40
years' experience on the Korean peninsula. "Intervention across the
border to create a buffer zone will be even harder because they would be
doubling their logistical challenges in supporting the refugees."

Many of the North Koreans attempting to cross would be trying to reach
friends or family within China. Across the Yalu River is the Liaoning
province, home to hundreds of thousands of ethnic Koreans. And across
the Tumen River is the Jilin province, which has closer to a million
ethnic Koreans, most in an area called the Yanbian Korean Autonomous
Prefecture. The capital of the latter, Yanji, is only about 10 km (6.2
miles) from the border.

In the event of conflict, China's refugee burden could eventually rival
that of Turkey. Sharing a border of 911 km (566 miles) with
Syria---which is now in its seventh year of civil war---Turkey is
struggling to provide for about 3 million Syrian refugees. While it's
had an open-door policy in the past, the country is now building a wall
with a height of 3 meters (10 feet) along its Syria border, complemented
by ditches, fences, and minefields.

Turkey also has spent heavily supporting Syrian refugees---and has
demanded other nations pitch in on the bill. China, too, would likely
seek economic assistance from other nations, especially South Korea and
the US, to help it cope with the cost of supporting refugees.

Just as Turkey hasn't been alone in dealing with the Syrian refugee
crisis---Lebanon, Jordan, and Iraq have struggled, too---China wouldn't
be the only nation coping with desperate North Koreans.

Japan takes the threat seriously enough that it's been drawing up
contingency plans to deal with an influx of North Korean refugees, who
would have to first survive crossing the Sea of Japan. Russia, too, has
a border with North Korea, and a large population of North Koreans,
especially in Vladivostok. But its border, at about 17 km (11 miles), is
much shorter, and would be easier to secure in a crisis. And of course
there's South Korea, which is another story in itself. If the situation
grows desperate enough, we may just see mass numbers of North Koreans
trying to cross the DMZ.

A tricky balance for Beijing

As for how central authority in North Korea could break down in the
first place, it could happen in a number of ways. A [[conflict
between]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[No]{.underline}]{.mark}**rth
**[[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}**rea [[and]{.mark} the
**[US]{.mark}**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}/[[or]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[So]{.underline}]{.mark}**uth [[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}rea [could
**[rapidly escalate]{.mark} in[to]{.mark} a [war]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
An assassination of Kim could be followed by a failed replacement effort
by the ruling Workers' Party. A manmade disaster, such as a
Chernobyl-type event at the North's Yongbyon nuclear reactor, could be
the cause. It could even be an eruption of Mount Paektu, which showed
signs of life in 2014 and, nearly 1,100 years ago, was home to one of
the planet's most violent eruptions in the past 5,000 years. Some worry
the next nuclear test by North Korea could actually set off Mount
Paektu.

However it happens, "[[as]{.mark} central [control]{.mark}
[evaporates]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[local]{.mark} [control]{.mark}
[by]{.mark} [military]{.mark} units is **[quite
possible]{.mark}**]{.underline}," notes Collins. "Those [[groups
that]{.mark} grab the [nukes]{.mark} will [have]{.mark} the **[upper
hand]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [This [could lead to **civil
war**]{.mark}]{.underline}, pushing North Koreans north to China, off
both coasts in flight by sea, and attempts to cross the DMZ. The latter
would result in more deaths than successes due to the density of
military forces there."

#### Civil wars draw in great powers\-\--causes nuclear escalation. 

Barry R. **Posen 17**. Fellow of the American Academy since 2010, is the
Ford International Professor of Political Science at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology and Director of the MIT Security Studies
Program. 09/21/2017. "Civil Wars & the Structure of World Power."
Daedalus, vol. 146, no. 4, pp. 167--179.

A bipolar structure of power is equally rare, and the Cold War is our
only example. When two [states]{.underline} overshadow the rest, they
[eye one another]{.underline} **[warily]{.underline}** because each is
the greatest threat to the other. The competition tends to become
all-encompassing. [[As each]{.underline}]{.mark} power [[tries to
preserve]{.mark} or improve its [position]{.mark}, [the
other]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[scrutinizes]{.underline}**]{.mark}
[[these moves for how they **might become a
threat**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and how they might be exploited.
[**[Countermeasures]{.underline}** [are taken]{.underline}]{.mark}
rather **[[quickly]{.underline}]{.mark}** when the other superpower
seems to be up to something. [In]{.underline} the Cold War, the
competition included military means, science and technology, the
accumulation of allies (despite their modest utility), and [competitive
interventions in **civil wars**]{.underline}. Of course, structure
cannot explain everything about the intensity of the Cold War
competition; the parties had vastly different ideologies and visions
about how the world should work, adding energy to an already fraught
situation. And the two sides confronted one another with unfamiliar but
extremely frightening nuclear weapons. Fear of nuclear escalation seems
to have put downward pressure on the competition: the two sides
struggled for advantage but seemed mindful of the possibility of
disaster. It is noteworthy that despite direct involvement in many wars,
and indirect support of the opposing sides in many others, there was no
direct violent clash of U.S. and Soviet forces. Finally, the bipolar
nature of the competition seems to have had a strange liberating effect
on each side\'s willingness to get involved in local conflicts. Instead
of fearing that involvement in a civil war would reduce capabilities
that might be needed elsewhere to oppose the other great power, these
conflicts were perceived as part of the central competition. One posited
reason for this is that, [due to the]{.underline} [**nuclear
competition**, each side had a very strong interest in]{.underline}
[**credibility**. Thus, [a]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[fight for
credibility anywhere]{.underline}** [could]{.underline}]{.mark} be
viewed as contributing positively to the credibility of one\'s
commitments to **[[risk nuclear war worldwide]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
Competitive Cold War interventions produced particularly tragic
outcomes. The **[[parties]{.underline}]{.mark}** [to]{.underline} these
[[civil wars were]{.underline} **[rendered artificially
strong]{.underline}** [by]{.underline} **[outside
assistance]{.underline}**]{.mark}[, so the [wars
were]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[more intense]{.mark} and
[longer-lasting]{.mark}]{.underline}** [than they might have otherwise
been]{.underline}.5 Once they had chosen sides, the superpowers might
find themselves in one of several kinds of traps. [If one\'s preferred
side]{.underline} **[fared poorly]{.underline}**, [[there was
a]{.underline} **[strong temptation]{.underline}**]{.mark}, as happened
in Vietnam and Afghanistan, [[to]{.underline} **[intervene
directly]{.underline}** [to **save one\'s proxy**]{.underline}]{.mark}[.
This presented a tempting opportunity to the]{.underline} **[other
superpower]{.underline}** [to]{.underline} [add resources to
**its**]{.underline} [client in order to]{.underline} **[bleed
its]{.underline}** principal **[opponent]{.underline}**. This was an
inexpensive way to improve one\'s own power position. At the same time,
when the two superpowers were involved directly or indirectly in a civil
war, they feared escalation to [**[direct engagements]{.underline}**
[between]{.underline}]{.mark} their own forces. As both parties were
**[[major nuclear weapons states]{.underline}]{.mark}**, a direct clash
would [[produce]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[risks]{.underline}]{.mark}**
and costs far in excess of anything to be gained from the civil war.
Thus, the two sides tended to focus more on "not losing" than on
winning, further prolonging the suffering of the civilians living in the
war zone. Multipolar systems have three or more great powers. But
measuring relative power in the twenty-first century is a tricky
proposition. By many measures, the United States is still comfortably
ahead of its closest competitor--China--though the gap is narrowing
quickly. My criteria for a great power are a large and diverse economy,
capable nonnuclear forces, some ability to project power beyond borders,
and nuclear deterrent forces with the ability to retaliate against a
state\'s most plausible adversaries and maintain that ability in the
face of a determined arms race. (Possession of an assured retaliatory
capability is essential for a state to pursue an independent security
policy in the nuclear age.) By these criteria, the key powers are
currently the United States, China, and Russia. France, Britain, and
India constitute a second tier of important powers. By mid-century,
Russia and India will likely reverse positions. Strict parity among
great powers is not a requirement for viewing a system as multipolar;
historically, there has often been a very large gap between the most and
the least capable "great powers." This analysis assumes that the world
is trending toward multipolarity and asks what difference it makes.
States compete for power and security in multipolar systems, but the
sheer number of players changes the game. First, in multipolar systems,
allies matter more than they do in other systems. With a handful of
powers at the top of the global order, coalitions can often
significantly outweigh the capability of any single state. Thus, though
states in a multipolar world must look to their own armaments in order
to be alliance-worthy, they must also look to the diplomacy of
coalitions. A second property of multipolar worlds is divided attention.
With many possible allies or adversaries, states will tend to see the
possibility for incremental gain; for example, if State a concludes that
State b is otherwise occupied with State c, that presents opportunity.
Third, the fear of countervailing coalitions imposes caution. In our
time, the presence of nuclear weapons imposes still further caution.
Fourth, it is plausible that multipolarity mutes ideological
competition. The need to make one\'s own alliances and undermine those
of an adversary may cause states to submerge their ideological
differences. If the world is trending toward multipolarity, this should
affect external intervention in civil wars. The great powers will be
more concerned about other great powers, which should make civil wars
generally less important to them and thus make early preventive
intervention less likely. The exception to this generalization may arise
[when civil wars occur in regions of]{.underline} particular
**[political importance]{.underline}** [for geographical, economic, or
ideological reasons]{.underline}, such as the greater Middle East. But
in these cases, **[great-power competition will be
intense]{.underline}** from the outset, exactly when cooperation would
be most useful for prevention. When multilateral intervention is
proposed in the collective interest of the international community, the
principal powers will still be concerned with relative gains. This will
further complicate the prospects for collaborative efforts to settle the
civil war. States may still wish to involve themselves in particular
civil wars, for their own selfish reasons; because the problems posed by
civil wars are often local, the most proximate great powers will be the
most tempted to intervene. Finally, once one great power does intervene,
and if its effort goes awry, it will be tempting for others to exploit
the situation to improve their own position. Other great powers may aid
the opposing side simply because the opportunity to enfeeble their
competition is too tempting. Alternatively, they may offer assistance to
continue the intervention or offer to create a diplomatic fig leaf to
cover a disengagement, at a high cost to the intervener.

### 2NC\-\--Impact\-\--AT: Denuclearization

target]{.mark}]{.underline} its 'arch-enemy', [[the **U**]{.mark}nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates]{.underline}, [with nuclear weapons.]{.underline}
Will potential talks between Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump be able to
defuse the risks of nuclear war? **[Considering the motivations behind
North Korea\'s nuclear weapons, the [chances]{.mark} that [it will
denuclearize are almost zero]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

[**No**rth **Ko**rea**'s** ballistic missiles with nuclear warheads will
soon be able to destroy cities in the mainland of the **U**nited
**S**tates]{.underline}.\[1\] [Looking at the provocative statements
from Pyongyang, this may not seem a purely theoretical
option.]{.underline} Yet, taking into account the motivations behind
North Korea's nuclear weapons programme, the risk that these weapons
will be actually used by purpose is relatively low. [[The main risks
are]{.mark} actually [miscommunication, misperception, or domestic
turmoil]{.mark} in Pyongyang, [leading to **inadvertent launch**]{.mark}
**of nuclear missiles**]{.underline}.

[[The]{.mark} main [motivation]{.mark} behind **No**rth **Ko**rea**'s**

[is]{.mark} simple]{.underline}: **[keeping the regime in
place]{.underline}**, or in other words: [[regime survival]{.mark},
preserving the status-quo for the country's ruling elite]{.underline}.
This key priority can be divided in two subcategories: foreign policy
aims and domestic aims.

#### The regime will never give up nukes\-\--means miscalc or diversionary lashout are structurally likely

Nightmare scenarios

Yet, [while the risk that North Korea will start a nuclear war by
purpose may be small, there are other risks]{.underline}. [[In]{.mark}
times of **[tension]{.mark}**]{.underline} -- [and in North Korea this
means: always]{.underline} -- [the [risk of]{.mark}
**[miscalc]{.mark}ulation**, [**miscommunication** and **misperception**
is always there]{.mark}]{.underline}. [If [the regime]{.mark} mistakenly
perceives that it is being attacked it [may]{.mark} decide to
**[launch]{.mark} nuclear weapons [immediately]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[before they are destroyed by the attack]{.underline}. For example,
[military exercises of adversaries or **technical [errors in air defence
systems]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[may be mistaken for]{.mark} actual
[surprise attacks]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Especially [because there are
**hardly any**]{.mark} **direct emergency [communication
systems]{.mark}**]{.underline} [between North Korea and its adversaries,
such [developments could **quickly escalate**]{.mark} **out of
control**]{.underline}.

[[Another risk is domestic turmoil]{.mark} in **No**rth **Ko**rea. [What
if]{.mark}]{.underline}, for any reason, [[a coup]{.mark} d'état [takes
place]{.mark} in Pyongyang?]{.underline} If [[Kim]{.mark} Jong Un and
his top aides [may]{.mark} consider their end near, one cannot exclude
that they decide to [enter the]{.mark} history [books with a]{.mark}
'big [bang']{.mark}, for example [taking]{.mark} some [US cities
with]{.mark} them in their fall. [This is a]{.mark} **nightmare
[scenario]{.mark}**]{.underline} [for [US policy makers;]{.mark} they
risk a sudden nuclear attack under circumstances that they [cannot
influence]{.mark} in any way]{.underline}.

Military action?

[[Much has been tried]{.mark} over the past decades to stop the North
Korean nuclear weapons development: [diplomacy,
sanctions]{.mark}]{.underline}, 'strategic patience', [[yet **without**
]{.mark}**any [success ]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [This failure of the
international community is mainly due to the lack of any good
options]{.underline}. [[Considering]{.mark} the [motivations of]{.mark}
the current North [Korean leadership]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[it
is]{.mark} very [unlikely]{.mark} that [it will ever give up the]{.mark}
nuclear [arsenal]{.mark}]{.underline}**; [these powerful weapons are
considered the best guarantee for regime survival]{.underline}. The
world will have to accept that neither diplomacy nor further isolation
of the 'hermit kingdom' will roll back its nuclear weapons status.
Military action may, but it carries large risks; that is why it has not
been tried earlier.

## Iran

### 1NC\-\--Cyber Attacks Good\-\--Iran

#### Cyber escalation is a [myth]{.underline} BUT cyber-attacks avoid [conventional war]{.underline}.

Erica **Lonergan, 22** (Erica Lonergan is Assistant Professor in the
Army Cyber Institute at West Point and a Research Scholar at the
Saltzman Institute of War and Peace Studies at Columbia University and
previously served as Senior Director on the U.S. Cyberspace Solarium

In fact, the negligible role of cyberattacks in the Ukraine conflict
should come as no surprise. Through war simulations, statistical
analyses, and other kinds of studies, scholars have found little
evidence that cyber-operations provide effective forms of coercion or
that they cause escalation to actual military conflict. That is because
for all its potential to disrupt companies, hospitals, and utility grids
during peacetime, [cyberpower is **much harder** to use against targets
of **strategic significance** or to **achieve outcomes** with **decisive
impacts**]{.underline}, either on the battlefield or during crises short
of war. [In failing to recognize this]{.underline}, [U.S.]{.underline}
officials and policymakers are [approaching the use of cyberpower in a
way that may be doing **more harm than good**]{.underline}---treating
cyber-operations like any other weapon of war rather than as a nonlethal
instrument of statecraft and, [in the process]{.underline}, [overlooking
the **considerable opportunities** as well as **risks** they
present]{.underline}.

THE MYTH OF CYBER-ESCALATION

Much of the [current [understanding]{.mark}]{.underline} in Washington
[[about]{.mark} the role of [cyber]{.mark}-operations in conflict is
[built on]{.mark}]{.underline} long-standing but [**[false]{.mark}
[assumptions]{.mark}** about cyberspace]{.underline}. Many scholars have
asserted that cyber-operations could easily lead to military escalation,
up to and including the use of nuclear weapons. Jason Healey and Robert
Jervis, for example, expressing a widely held view, have argued that an
incident that takes place in cyberspace, "might cross the threshold into
armed conflict either through a sense of impunity or through
miscalculation or mistake." Policymakers have also long believed that
cyberspace poses grave perils. In 2012, Secretary of Defense Leon
Panetta warned of an impending "cyber-Pearl Harbor," in which
adversaries could take down critical U.S. infrastructure through
cyberattacks. Nearly a decade later, FBI Director Christopher Wray
compared the threat from ransomware---when actors hold a target hostage
by encrypting data and demanding a ransom payment in return for
decrypting it---to the 9/11 attacks. And as recently as December 2021,
Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin noted that in cyberspace, "norms of
behavior aren't well-established and the risks of escalation and
miscalculation are high."

Seemingly buttressing these claims has been a long record of
cyber-operations by hostile governments. In recent years, states ranging
from Russia and China to Iran and North Korea have used cyberspace to
conduct large-scale espionage, inflict significant economic damage, and
undermine democratic institutions. In January 2021, for example,
attackers linked to the Chinese government were able to breach
Microsoft's Exchange email servers, giving them access to communications
and other private information from companies and governments, and may
have allowed other malicious actors to conduct ransomware attacks. That
breach followed on the heels of a Russian intrusion against the software
vendor SolarWinds, in which hackers were able to access a huge quantity
of sensitive government and corporate data---an espionage treasure
trove. Cyberattacks have also inflicted significant economic costs. The
NotPetya attack affected critical infrastructure around the
world---ranging from logistics and energy to finance and
government---causing upward of \$10 billion in damage.

But [the **[assumption]{.mark}** [that]{.mark} [cyber]{.mark}-operations
play a central role in either **[provok]{.mark}ing** [or]{.mark}
**[extend]{.mark}ing [war]{.mark}** [is **wrong**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[**Hundreds** of cyber[-incidents]{.mark} have [occurred]{.mark}
[between]{.mark} [rivals]{.mark} with **long histories**]{.underline} of
tension or even conflict, [[but]{.mark} **[none]{.mark}** has **ever**
**[triggered]{.mark}** an **[escalation]{.mark}** to war]{.underline}.
[**No**r]{.underline}th **[Ko]{.underline}**rea, for example, has
[conducted **major** cyberattacks against **So**]{.underline}uth
**[Ko]{.underline}**rea [on at least four different
occasions]{.underline}, including the "Ten Days of Rain" denial of
service attack---in which a network is flooded with an overwhelming
number of requests, becoming temporarily inaccessible to users---against
South Korean government websites, financial institutions, and critical
infrastructure in 2011 and the "Dark Seoul" attack in 2013, which
disrupted service across the country's financial and media sectors.

It would be [reasonable to expect that these operations might
**escalate** the situation on the **Korean Peninsula**]{.underline},
especially because North Korea's war plans against South Korea
reportedly involve cyber-operations. [Yet that is **not what
happened**]{.underline}. Instead, in each case, the South Korean
response was minimal and limited to either direct, official attribution
to North Korea by government officials or more indirect public
suggestions that Pyongyang was likely behind the attacks.

Similarly, although the United States reserves the right to respond to
cyberattacks in any way it sees fit, including with military force, it
has until now relied on economic sanctions, indictments, diplomatic
actions, and some reported instances of tit-for-tat cyber-responses. For
example, following Russia's interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential
election, the Obama administration expelled 35 Russian diplomats and
shuttered two facilities said to be hubs for Russian espionage. The
Treasury Department also levied economic sanctions against Russian
officials. Yet according to media reports, the administration ultimately
rejected plans to conduct retaliatory cyber-operations against Russia.
And although the United States did use its own cyber-operations to
respond to Russian attacks during the 2018 midterm elections, it limited
itself to temporarily disrupting the Internet Research Agency, a Russian
troll farm.

These measured responses are not unusual. [Despite decades of malicious
behavior in cyberspace]{.underline}---and no matter the level of
destruction---[[cyberattacks]{.mark} have **always** **been
[contained]{.mark}** [**below**]{.mark} the level of **[armed]{.mark}
[conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Indeed, researchers have found that
[major adversarial [powers]{.mark} across the world have routinely
**[observed]{.mark}**]{.underline} a "firebreak" between cyberattacks
and conventional military operations: [a **[mutually]{.mark} [understood
line]{.mark}** that **distinguishes strategic
interactions**]{.underline} above and below it, similar to the threshold
that exists for the employment of nuclear weapons.

But it is not just that cyber-operations do not lead to conflict.
[[Cyberattacks]{.underline}]{.mark} can also be [**[useful]{.mark}**
ways [to **project power**]{.mark} [in]{.mark} [situations in
which]{.mark} **[armed conflict]{.mark}** is expressly [being]{.mark}
**[avoided]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [This is [why
**Iran**]{.mark}]{.underline}, for example, might [[find]{.mark}
cyber[attacks]{.mark} against the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates, including the 2012--13 denial of service attacks
it conducted against U.S. financial institutions,
**[[appealing]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Since Iran likely prefers
[to]{.mark} [avoid]{.mark} a **direct [military]{.mark}
confrontation**]{.underline} with the United States, [[cyberattacks
provide]{.mark} a [way to retaliate]{.mark} for perceived
grievances]{.underline}, such as U.S. economic sanctions in response to
Iran's nuclear program, [**[without]{.mark} [triggering]{.mark}** the
kind of escalation that would put]{.underline} the [two
countries]{.underline} on a path [to **[war]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

As we approach the 100th anniversary World War I, we should remember
that this colossal disaster escalated uncontrollably from what was
intended to be a minor conflict. There is a danger that [an [attack
on]{.mark} **[Iran]{.mark}** would [escalate into]{.mark} a
[**large-scale war** in]{.mark} the **[Mi]{.mark}ddle
[East]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [entirely **destabilizing** a region that
is **already deep** in **problems**]{.underline}.

The unstable government of [**[Pakistan]{.mark}** might be
**[overthrown]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and the [**revolutionary**
Pakistani government might **[enter]{.mark} the war** on the side of
**Iran**]{.underline}, thus [[introducing]{.mark} **[nuclear]{.mark}
[weapons]{.mark}** into the conflict]{.underline}. [[**Russia** and
**China**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [**firm allies** of Iran]{.underline},
might [also [be **drawn in**]{.mark}**to** a]{.underline} general [war
in the Middle East]{.underline}. Since much of the [[world\'s oil
comes]{.mark} [from]{.mark} the [region]{.mark}]{.underline}, such a
[[war]{.mark} would certainly [cause]{.mark} the [**price of** **oil**
to reach **unheard-of heights**]{.mark}]{.underline}, with catastrophic
effects on the global economy.

In the dangerous situation that could potentially result from an attack
on Iran, there is a [risk that [nuclear weapons]{.mark} would be
[used]{.mark}]{.underline}, [either
**[intentionally]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[or by **accident** or]{.mark}
**[miscalc]{.mark}**ulation]{.underline}. Recent research has shown that
besides [[maki]{.underline}]{.mark}ng [**large areas** of the
[world]{.mark} **[uninhabitable]{.mark}** [through]{.mark}
**long-lasting [radioactive contamination]{.mark}**]{.underline}, a
nuclear war [would [damage **global ag**]{.mark}**riculture** to such a
extent that a **[global famine]{.mark}** of previously **unknown
proportions** [would **result**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Thus, nuclear war is [the ultimate **[eco]{.mark}logical
[catastrophe]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It [could [destroy **human
civilization**]{.mark} [and]{.mark} much of the
**[biosphere]{.mark}**]{.underline}. To risk such a war would be an
unforgivable offense against the lives and future of all the peoples of
the world, US citizens included.

North Korea is portrayed as a nation run by insane ruler, but [building

[of]{.mark}]{.underline} their **[[fossil fuels]{.underline}]{.mark}**
after the Soviet Union collapsed. Andrei Lankov, a professor at Kookmin
University in Seoul, wrote "the world is likely to say that the North
Koreans are acting "irrationally." But this is not the case --- they are
a very rational regime, actually the world's most Machiavellian. North
Korean leaders are sending a message...using both artillery and
centrifuges to say: "We are here, we are dangerous, and we cannot be
ignored. We can make a lot of trouble, but also we behave reasonably if
rewarded generously enough. ... U.S. policy toward Pyongyang has been
based ... on the assumption that North Korea can be persuaded and bribed
into surrendering its nuclear program. It is an illusion: The survival
of the North Korean regime depends to a large extent on its blackmail
diplomacy. There has never been a chance that it would surrender its
nuclear program, which alone makes it possible to extract sufficient aid
from the outside world. [The entire world is on the cusp of the **energy
cliff**]{.underline} --- [will other nations also try this
**tactic?**]{.underline} Though North Korea may have been more
predisposed to take this route given their long and tragic history,
including being occupied by the Japanese in the 1920s, massively
destroyed by the Korean War in 1950-53, and major natural disasters in
the mid-1990s. With little farmland and poor soils, the North Korean
population was far past their carrying capacity when massive fossil fuel
and food imports dropped suddenly after the collapse of the Soviet Union
-- millions of people may have died as a consequence (Pfeiffer,
Wikipedia). [Even the [US]{.mark}A might **nuclear [blackmail]{.mark}**
the **[world]{.mark}**]{.underline} Even [the United States might be
**tempted**]{.underline}, according to Erik Townsend:
"[[While]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[use]{.underline}]{.mark} of nuclear

[US]{.mark}A has [yet to endure]{.mark} [significant]{.mark} **economic
[hardship]{.mark}**]{.underline}. ... [a government [operating in crisis

[would [change]{.mark} the [mood **considerably**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[All the USA has to do]{.underline} in order to secure an unlimited
supply of \$50 per barrel oil [is to threaten to nuke any country
refusing to sell oil]{.underline} to the U.S. for that price.
Unthinkable today, but [in times of national crisis]{.underline},
[morals are often the first thing to be forgotten]{.underline}. We like
to tell ourselves that we would never allow economic hardship to cause
us to lose our morals. ...What we'll do [[in]{.mark} a true
[crisis]{.mark}]{.underline} that threatens our very way of life is
anyone's guess. [If faced with the choice between]{.underline} a
Soviet-style **[economic collapse]{.underline}** and abusing its
military power, [the [US]{.mark}A]{.underline} just might [[resort to
tactics]{.underline}]{.mark} previously [[**thought**

Almost 30 years after the end of the Cold War, the threat of nuclear
Armageddon seems like a thing of the past. Even though tensions over the
Kashmir region between India and Pakistan and the [U.S.'s withdrawal
from the **[Iran]{.mark}** nuclear deal have [increased the threat
of]{.mark} the use of **[nuc]{.mark}**lear weapon**[s]{.mark}** on a
regional basis]{.underline}, fears of a cold, irradiated Earth are
mostly gone. [Unfortunately]{.underline}, Jonas Jägermeyr, his
colleagues, and their models of global climate and food production
aren't convinced. According to their predictions, [**[even a
regional]{.mark} nuclear [war]{.mark}** holds the potential to [plunge
the world into]{.mark} a]{.underline} so-called [[**"nuclear winter,"**
with]{.mark} drastic [consequences for **global**]{.mark}]{.underline}
public health and food **[[security]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

The nuclear winter scenario was originally proposed in the journal
Science by a group of scientists lead by Carl Sagan during the Cold War.
It claims that [the smoke and dust launched]{.underline} into the
atmosphere [by]{.underline} a series of [nuclear
[detonations]{.mark}]{.underline} and the resulting mass firestorms [has
the potential to [block]{.mark} out]{.underline} a portion of [incoming
sun**[light]{.mark}**]{.underline} to the Earth's surface. [That could
dramatically [influence]{.mark} global **[temp]{.mark}**erature[**s**,
destroy]{.mark} the [ozone]{.mark} layer, and make it harder for crops
to grow]{.underline}. Together, those factors make the food supply one
of the most vulnerable systems in the event of a nuclear winter.

That brings us back to the new simulations published this year and its
predictions. According to the authors, "[a [**regional conflict** using
**\<1%** of]{.mark} the worldwide nuclear [arsenal could]{.mark} have
adverse consequences for global food security unmatched in modern
history."]{.underline} They predict a drop in average global food
production of about 11% for up to 5 years, [[surpassing]{.mark} even
[the worst]{.mark} historical [famines]{.mark}]{.underline} caused by
volcanic winters.

(BJN)

The Pentagon announced late Thursday night that the U.S. military killed
a top-ranking senior Iranian official in an airstrike carried out at the
direction of President Donald Trump. The killing is understood as
[[a]{.mark} major [escalation in U.S.-Iran
relations]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [prompt]{.underline}]{.mark}ing online
conversations about the prospect of an impending **["[World War
3."]{.mark}]{.underline}** Last night, as I watched our latest
existential terror unfold through a torrent of World War 3 memes, I
found myself wondering not just what political leaders will do but also
what the people of both countries and the broader world will experience
as we prepare for what now feels like inevitable further escalations.
While [[the potential for]{.mark} large-scale [global]{.mark} political
[conflict is **palpable**]{.mark}]{.underline}, the more immediate
concern will be the drumbeat for marching forward with military action
that could take us there. How to make sense of it, this immediate future
that now rides on an ever-thinner razor's edge? First, we have to
establish how we got here. Last night, the Pentagon put out a statement
saying that the U.S. military had killed Iranian general Qasem Soleimani
"at the direction of the president" with the aim of "deterring future
Iranian attack plans." The Pentagon statement claimed that Soleimani,
leader of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Quds Force, was
responsible for hundreds of deaths and thousands of injuries to U.S. and
coalition service members. [Trump's history with Iran isn't particularly
friendly. Trump called Iran a "rogue state]{.underline} whose chief
exports are violence, bloodshed and chaos\" in a 2017 United Nations
speech. In 2018, he pulled the U.S. out of the Iran nuclear deal (aka
the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA) negotiated by his
predecessor, President Barack Obama. That same year, he threatened the
Iranian president on Twitter. As laid out on a timeline by Al Jazeera,
[Iran refused to meet demands the Trump administration]{.underline} made
after ending the JCPOA. In response, Trump launched two new rounds of
sanctions in 2018, adding to a lineage of U.S. sanctions against the
country dating back to Ronald Reagan's administration. In 2019, Trump
increased sanctions against Iran and designated the IRGC a terrorist
force. Recently, Trump beefed up U.S. military presence in the Middle
East following riots and attacks on the U.S. embassy in Baghdad, Iraq
--- one of Iran's two neighbors that has been the theatre for a
protracted U.S.-led war and one that's been deeply enmeshed in the
history of U.S.-Iranian relations since Iran's 1979 revolution. The
embassy riots reportedly came in response to U.S. strikes on facilities
tied to an Iranian-backed militia, which was itself a response to a
rocket attack that killed a U.S. contractor. So how does Soleimani fit
into all this? As reported by the Washington Post, Soleimani was the
leader of a group known as the Quds Force, part of the IRGC, which is a
major branch of Iran's military that arose after the 1979 Islamic
revolution. The Quds Force has a reputation for being the IRGC's elite
and efficient soldiers. In his role, according to Al Jazeera, Soleimani
helmed Iranian operations in foreign countries like Iraq, where he was
involved in the fight against the Islamic State (aka ISIS), and Syria,
where he supported President Bashar al-Assad. According to the
Associated Press, he was also allied with several militia groups in
countries across the Middle East. If it seems like Soleimani was a big
deal, it's because he very much was. Considered by some the second most
powerful man in the country, Soleimani's execution at Trump's directive
is the exact sort of geopolitical conflict that could reignite
long-standing tensions in extremely unpredictable ways. Some time after
Trump tweeted out a low-resolution picture of a U.S. flag, Iranian
ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed "harsh vengeance," and Iranian president
Hassan Rouhani promised "revenge." Nobody seems to know what to make of
all this. As journalists rushed out quick bios of Soleimani, a visual
guide to the U.S. airstrike that killed him, and ceaseless live updates
on the story, Twitter cycled through trending topics trying to make some
light of the dark situation. Beyond the World War 3 memes, some people
pointed out that Trump's frequent tweets about Obama starting a war with
Iran to win an election seemed relevant. Many others discovered that
receiving college financial aid through FAFSA requires registering for
selective service. Others jokingly considered another Area 51 raid for
some extraterrestrial salvation. [Unfortunately]{.underline}, as climate
justice activists are wont to remind us, **[[there is no planet
B.]{.underline}]{.mark}** [The questions about what happens next are
anxiety-inducing]{.underline}, especially for people in Iran and the
surrounding region. United Nations population figures estimate that
[roughly 80 million people live in Iran.]{.underline} Estimates for Iraq
are near 40 million and, for Afghanistan, around 35 million.
[[Iran]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[has]{.underline}]{.mark} historical
[[tensions with]{.mark} other regional powers, like [Saudi Arabia and
Israel]{.mark}]{.underline} (two of the [United States' biggest
allies]{.underline} in the region) [[and is]{.underline}]{.mark}
currently [[aligned with]{.underline}]{.mark} global powers [[China and
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} (**[representing]{.underline}** two of the
United States' more **[contentious]{.underline}** political
**[relationships]{.underline}**). [If [a U.S. invasion of
Iran]{.mark}]{.underline} was as deadly and prolonged as those in Iraq
or Afghanistan, hundreds of thousands could die, many of them civilians.
If this conflict somehow became as deadly as World War I or World War
II, [it [could]{.mark} [mean]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[countless]{.underline}**]{.mark} more
**[[killed]{.underline}]{.mark}**, injured, or displaced from their
homes. Simply put, [the question of [war]{.mark}]{.underline} with Iran
**[must be answered with a loud and emphatic no]{.underline}**, as
planned protest actions for Saturday, January 4, already intend to
communicate. Whatever legal framework the president and his supporters
might cling to in order to justify Trump's right to direct the attack,
the reality is that this assassination is an act of war --- whether the
White House wants to officially designate it as one or not. Some are
cheering Soleimani's killing, publishing extremely reductive takes about
the removal of the "world's No. 1 bad guy." But [Trump's]{.underline}
directive [[has]{.underline}]{.mark} unknown [[potential to]{.mark}
**irrevocably [destabilize]{.mark} an [entire
region]{.mark}**]{.underline} and put millions at risk. And that [is
very, very scary.]{.underline}

### 1NC\-\--Cyberattacks Good\-\--T/L

#### Cyberattacks [avoid conventional war]{.underline}\-\--that's [worse]{.underline}\-\--AND leads to [nonprolif]{.underline}.

Cybèle **Greenberg, 21** (Cybèle Greenberg is a fellow with the New York
Times editorial board, 8-22-2021, accessed on 7-18-2022, The New York
Times, "Could Cyberwar Make the World Safer?",
[[https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/22/opinion/cyberwar-world-safety.html]{.underline}](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/22/opinion/cyberwar-world-safety.html),
HBisevac)

Indeed, despite its many consequences and dangers, [there is
**[no]{.mark} documented [instance]{.mark}** in which
[cyberwar]{.mark}fare has]{.underline} directly **[[killed]{.mark}
[anyone]{.mark}]{.underline}** (although it has come close).

As the post-Sept. 11 conflicts come to an abrupt end, we are now at an
important crossroads when it comes to determining just how far we are
willing to take cyberwar. One possible avenue points to perilous
conflict escalation between great powers further enabled by digital
technologies.

But an alternative perspective sees [[cyberwar]{.mark} as an opportunity
to **decrease global violence**]{.underline}. Could such tactics shift
war's focus away from human casualties?

In other words, [can nations **settle** for **slugging** it out
**online**]{.underline}, [rather than with **guns** and
**missiles**]{.underline}?

[Fighting **digitally** [offers]{.mark} a **unique
opportunity**]{.underline}: the [[continuation]{.mark} [of
politics]{.mark}]{.underline} by other means,
[[without]{.underline}]{.mark} the **[physical
[invasion]{.mark}]{.underline}** of a sovereign territory [[or]{.mark}
the **inevitable [sacrifice]{.mark}** [of
**lives**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Tempered by responsible use and
appropriate controls, [cyberwarfare is a [safer]{.mark} and
[more]{.mark} **[flexible strategic alt]{.mark}**]{.underline}ernative,
one critical step between sanctions and bombs.

"[The purpose of warfare is **not to fight**]{.underline}; [it is to
achieve a **political objective**]{.underline}," said Nora Bensahel, a
visiting professor of strategic studies at Johns Hopkins School of
Advanced International Studies. "[If you can achieve this objective
**without kinetic conflict**]{.underline}, [so much **the
better**]{.underline}."

Consider Nitro Zeus. In the late 2000s, as The Times reported, the U.S.
government developed a detailed plan for cyberattacks that would disable
sections of Iran's air defenses, communications systems and power grid.
The plan provided President Barack Obama with a nonlethal means to
neutralize Iranian military assets in case negotiations to halt the
country's rogue nuclear enrichment program failed and Tehran sought to
retaliate.

The Nitro Zeus contingency plan remained active until the fulfillment of
terms in the nuclear deal signed in 2015, ready to offer phased
escalation short of all-out war if diplomatic and economic pressures
proved ineffective.

Since Nitro Zeus was ultimately shelved, it is difficult to assess the
scope and likelihood of the collateral damage it could have caused. The
[[integration]{.mark} of cyberweapons into]{.underline} a [national
security strategy [points to]{.mark} a]{.underline} certain
[**[reluctance]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} default to]{.underline} the
**[[conventional]{.underline}]{.mark}** --- and more lethal ---
**[option]{.underline}**. But whether it's a drone strike or the hacking
of a telecommunications network, a cyberattack will always have harmful
repercussions for civilians and private enterprises.

Counterintuitively, however, [[cyberweapons]{.mark} can also
**[increase]{.mark} [geopolitical]{.mark}
[stability]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[[Cyberattacks]{.underline}]{.mark} have [[helped]{.mark} nations
[achieve]{.mark} **[nuclear]{.mark}**
**[nonprolif]{.mark}**]{.underline}eration in a way that, in the past,
would have required physical force and increased risk to personnel, said
Vipin Narang, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor who
specializes in nuclear strategy.

In [2007]{.underline}, [Israeli fighter jets equipped with 500-pound
bombs struck a suspected nuclear reactor in Syria]{.underline}. The
facility was destroyed and Israel was internationally criticized for
violating another country's sovereignty. Ten North Korean scientists
reportedly may have been killed in the attack.

The [U.S.-Israeli **o**]{.underline}ffensive **[c]{.underline}**yber
**[o]{.underline}**peration known as Stuxnet, which was launched around
the same time, [achieved a similar objective]{.underline} --- impeding a
rogue nation's enrichment efforts --- [but]{.underline} from afar, [with
no **human cost**]{.underline}. The program destroyed nearly one-fifth
of Iran's operating centrifuges and may have slowed its nuclear program
by up to two years. No one was reported to have been physically harmed
or killed during the yearslong operation. It may have even [**deterred
Israel** from launching a conventional attack on Iran's Natanz uranium
enrichment site]{.underline}.

In fact, the negligible role of cyberattacks in the Ukraine conflict
should come as no surprise. Through war simulations, statistical
analyses, and other kinds of studies, scholars have found little
evidence that cyber-operations provide effective forms of coercion or
that they cause escalation to actual military conflict. That is because
for all its potential to disrupt companies, hospitals, and utility grids
during peacetime, [cyberpower is **much harder** to use against targets
of **strategic significance** or to **achieve outcomes** with **decisive
impacts**]{.underline}, either on the battlefield or during crises short
of war. [In failing to recognize this]{.underline}, [U.S.]{.underline}
officials and policymakers are [approaching the use of cyberpower in a
way that may be doing **more harm than good**]{.underline}---treating
cyber-operations like any other weapon of war rather than as a nonlethal
instrument of statecraft and, [in the process]{.underline}, [overlooking
the **considerable opportunities** as well as **risks** they
present]{.underline}.

THE MYTH OF CYBER-ESCALATION

Much of the [current [understanding]{.mark}]{.underline} in Washington
[[about]{.mark} the role of [cyber]{.mark}-operations in conflict is
[built on]{.mark}]{.underline} long-standing but [**[false]{.mark}
[assumptions]{.mark}** about cyberspace]{.underline}. Many scholars have
asserted that cyber-operations could easily lead to military escalation,
up to and including the use of nuclear weapons. Jason Healey and Robert
Jervis, for example, expressing a widely held view, have argued that an
incident that takes place in cyberspace, "might cross the threshold into
armed conflict either through a sense of impunity or through
miscalculation or mistake." Policymakers have also long believed that
cyberspace poses grave perils. In 2012, Secretary of Defense Leon
Panetta warned of an impending "cyber-Pearl Harbor," in which
adversaries could take down critical U.S. infrastructure through
cyberattacks. Nearly a decade later, FBI Director Christopher Wray
compared the threat from ransomware---when actors hold a target hostage
by encrypting data and demanding a ransom payment in return for
decrypting it---to the 9/11 attacks. And as recently as December 2021,
Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin noted that in cyberspace, "norms of
behavior aren't well-established and the risks of escalation and
miscalculation are high."

Seemingly buttressing these claims has been a long record of
cyber-operations by hostile governments. In recent years, states ranging
from Russia and China to Iran and North Korea have used cyberspace to
conduct large-scale espionage, inflict significant economic damage, and
undermine democratic institutions. In January 2021, for example,
attackers linked to the Chinese government were able to breach
Microsoft's Exchange email servers, giving them access to communications
and other private information from companies and governments, and may
have allowed other malicious actors to conduct ransomware attacks. That
breach followed on the heels of a Russian intrusion against the software
vendor SolarWinds, in which hackers were able to access a huge quantity
of sensitive government and corporate data---an espionage treasure
trove. Cyberattacks have also inflicted significant economic costs. The
NotPetya attack affected critical infrastructure around the
world---ranging from logistics and energy to finance and
government---causing upward of \$10 billion in damage.

But [the **[assumption]{.mark}** [that]{.mark} [cyber]{.mark}-operations
play a central role in either **[provok]{.mark}ing** [or]{.mark}
**[extend]{.mark}ing [war]{.mark}** [is **wrong**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[**Hundreds** of cyber[-incidents]{.mark} have [occurred]{.mark}
[between]{.mark} [rivals]{.mark} with **long histories**]{.underline} of
tension or even conflict, [[but]{.mark} **[none]{.mark}** has **ever**
**[triggered]{.mark}** an **[escalation]{.mark}** to war]{.underline}.
[**No**r]{.underline}th **[Ko]{.underline}**rea, for example, has
[conducted **major** cyberattacks against **So**]{.underline}uth
**[Ko]{.underline}**rea [on at least four different
occasions]{.underline}, including the "Ten Days of Rain" denial of
service attack---in which a network is flooded with an overwhelming
number of requests, becoming temporarily inaccessible to users---against
South Korean government websites, financial institutions, and critical
infrastructure in 2011 and the "Dark Seoul" attack in 2013, which
disrupted service across the country's financial and media sectors.

It would be [reasonable to expect that these operations might
**escalate** the situation on the **Korean Peninsula**]{.underline},
especially because North Korea's war plans against South Korea
reportedly involve cyber-operations. [Yet that is **not what
happened**]{.underline}. Instead, in each case, the South Korean
response was minimal and limited to either direct, official attribution
to North Korea by government officials or more indirect public
suggestions that Pyongyang was likely behind the attacks.

Similarly, although the United States reserves the right to respond to
cyberattacks in any way it sees fit, including with military force, it
has until now relied on economic sanctions, indictments, diplomatic
actions, and some reported instances of tit-for-tat cyber-responses. For
example, following Russia's interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential
election, the Obama administration expelled 35 Russian diplomats and
shuttered two facilities said to be hubs for Russian espionage. The
Treasury Department also levied economic sanctions against Russian
officials. Yet according to media reports, the administration ultimately
rejected plans to conduct retaliatory cyber-operations against Russia.
And although the United States did use its own cyber-operations to
respond to Russian attacks during the 2018 midterm elections, it limited
itself to temporarily disrupting the Internet Research Agency, a Russian
troll farm.

These measured responses are not unusual. [Despite decades of malicious
behavior in cyberspace]{.underline}---and no matter the level of
destruction---[[cyberattacks]{.mark} have **always** **been
[contained]{.mark}** [**below**]{.mark} the level of **[armed]{.mark}
[conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Indeed, researchers have found that
[major adversarial [powers]{.mark} across the world have routinely
**[observed]{.mark}**]{.underline} a "firebreak" between cyberattacks
and conventional military operations: [a **[mutually]{.mark} [understood
line]{.mark}** that **distinguishes strategic
interactions**]{.underline} above and below it, similar to the threshold
that exists for the employment of nuclear weapons.

But it is not just that cyber-operations do not lead to conflict.
[[Cyberattacks]{.underline}]{.mark} can also be [**[useful]{.mark}**
ways [to **project power**]{.mark} [in]{.mark} [situations in
which]{.mark} **[armed conflict]{.mark}** is expressly [being]{.mark}
**[avoided]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [This is [why
**Iran**]{.mark}]{.underline}, for example, might [[find]{.mark}
cyber[attacks]{.mark} against the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates, including the 2012--13 denial of service attacks
it conducted against U.S. financial institutions,
**[[appealing]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Since Iran likely prefers
[to]{.mark} [avoid]{.mark} a **direct [military]{.mark}
confrontation**]{.underline} with the United States, [[cyberattacks
provide]{.mark} a [way to retaliate]{.mark} for perceived
grievances]{.underline}, such as U.S. economic sanctions in response to
Iran's nuclear program, [**[without]{.mark} [triggering]{.mark}** the
kind of escalation that would put]{.underline} the [two
countries]{.underline} on a path [to **[war]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

More importantly, [there are **powerful strategic constraints** on those
who have the **ability** to launch **catastrophe attacks**]{.underline}.
[We have]{.underline} more than two [decades of **experience** with the
use of **cyber techniques** and **operations** for
**coercive**]{.underline} and criminal [**purposes** and have a clear
understanding of **motives**]{.underline},
**[capabilities]{.underline}**, [and **intentions**]{.underline}. We can
be guided by the methods of the Strategic Bombing Survey, which used
interviews and observation (rather than hypotheses) to determine effect.
These methods apply equally to cyberattacks. The conclusions we can draw
from this are: [**[Nonstate]{.mark} actors** [and **most
states**]{.mark} [lack]{.mark} the [**capability** to]{.mark} **launch
attacks** that [cause]{.mark} physical **[damage]{.mark}** [at **any
level**]{.mark}]{.underline}, much less a catastrophe. There have been
regular predictions every year for over a decade that nonstate actors
will acquire these high-end cyber capabilities in two or three years in
what has become a cycle of repetition. The [**monetary return** is
**negligible**]{.underline}, [which **dissuades**]{.underline} the
[skilled cybercriminals]{.underline} (mostly Russian speaking) [who
might have the necessary skills]{.underline}. One mystery is why these
groups have not been used as mercenaries, and this may reflect either a
degree of control by the Russian state (if it has forbidden mercenary
acts) or a degree of caution by criminals. [There is **[enough
uncertainty]{.mark}** [among]{.mark} potential [attackers]{.mark}
[about]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates' [ability to **[attribute]{.mark}** that
they are **[unwilling]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} **[risk]{.mark} massive
[retal]{.mark}iation** in response to a catastrophic
attack]{.underline}. (They are perfectly willing to take the risk of
attribution for espionage and coercive cyber actions.) **[[No
one]{.mark} has ever [died]{.mark} [from]{.mark} a
[cyberattack]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and only a handful of these attacks
have produced physical damage. A [cyberattack is **not** a nuclear
weapon]{.underline}, [and it is **intellectually lazy** to **equate
them**]{.underline} to nuclear weapons. Using a tactical nuclear weapon
against an urban center would produce several hundred thousand
casualties, while a strategic nuclear exchange would cause tens of
millions of casualties and immense physical destruction. These are
catastrophes that some hack cannot duplicate. The shadow of nuclear war
distorts discussion of cyber warfare. [[State]{.mark} use of cyber
op]{.underline}eration[s]{.underline} is [consistent with their **broad
national**]{.underline} strategies and **[interests]{.underline}**.
Their [primary [emphasis]{.mark} is [on]{.mark} [**espionage**
and]{.mark} **political [coercion]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The
[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates has
[[opponents]{.underline}]{.mark} and is in conflict with them, but they
[[have]{.mark} **[no interest]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} [launching]{.mark} a
[catastrophic]{.mark} cyber[attack]{.mark} since it [would]{.mark}
certainly [produce]{.mark} an **equally [catastrophic]{.mark}
[retal]{.mark}iation**]{.underline}. Their goal is to stay below the
"use-of-force" threshold and undertake damaging cyber actions against
the United States, not start a war. This has implications for the
discussion of **[[inadvertent]{.mark}
[escalation]{.mark}]{.underline}**, something that [has]{.underline}
also **[[never occurred]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The concern over
escalation deserves a longer discussion, as [there are]{.underline} both
[**technological** and **strategic [constraints]{.mark}** [that]{.mark}
shape and **[limit]{.mark}** [risk]{.mark} in cyber
op]{.underline}eration[s]{.underline}, and the absence of inadvertent
escalation suggests a [[high degree of control]{.mark} for cyber
capabilities by advanced states]{.underline}. Attackers, particularly
among the United States' major opponents for whom cyber is just one of
the tools for confrontation, seek to avoid actions that could trigger
escalation. [The **U**nited **S**tates has two opponents (**China** and
**Russia**) who are capable of damaging cyberattacks.]{.underline}
Russia has demonstrated its attack skills on the Ukrainian power grid,
[but [neither **Russia**]{.mark} n[or]{.mark} [**China**]{.mark} would
be [well served by]{.mark} a]{.underline} similar [[attack on]{.mark}
the **[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates.
**[Iran]{.mark}**]{.underline} is improving and [may reach the point
where it [could]{.mark} use cyberattacks]{.underline} to cause major
damage, [[but]{.mark} it would **[only]{.mark}** do so [when]{.mark} it
has [**decided** to **engage** in]{.mark} a **[major]{.mark} armed
[conflict]{.mark}** with the **U**nited **S**tates]{.underline}. Iran
might attack targets outside the United States and its allies with less
risk and continues to experiment with cyberattacks against Israeli
critical infrastructure. [**North Korea** has **not**]{.underline} yet
[developed this kind of capability]{.underline}.

#### Data proves.

Politics at the Marine Corps University, Cyber Security Senior Fellow at

Stopped Worrying about Cyber Doom and Started Collecting Data, Politics
and Governance, 6(2), Cogitatio Press\]

6\. Expanding Cyber Security Data [Our team has been coding]{.underline}
cyber incident [data since 2010]{.underline} and serves as a unique
example of how the process of collecting cyber security data and
evidence can be done. Our first peer reviewed published work appeared in
2014 in Journal of Peace Research (Valeriano & Maness, 2014). In this
article we note that [[cyber conflict is]{.mark} **much more
[restrained]{.mark}** than generally understood]{.underline} by popular
discourse. [[Threat inflation is **ripe**]{.mark} **in cyber
security**]{.underline}, and the real use of cyber tools seems to be to
enhance the power of strong states.

The data that Valeriano and Maness (2014, 2015) have built challenges
the cyber revolution perspective and does so with the tools of social
science, and is a necessary turn given the general tone of the debate.
We first determine that a viable data collection method in light of
limited resources was to focus on states that are committed interstate
rivals (Diehl & Goertz, 2001). This allows us to focus on those actors
with an intense history of recent hostilities that should be the most
likely users of cyber technology on the battlefield (Maness & Valeriano,
2018).

In our research (Maness & Valeriano, 2016; Maness, Valeriano, & Jensen,
2017; Valeriano & Maness, 2014, 2015), we have been able to marshal a
massive amount of evidence that is useful in dissecting the actual
trends on the cyber battlefield in a geopolitical context. We
demonstrate that while [[cyber-attacks]{.mark} are increasing in
frequency, they [are limited **in severity**]{.mark}]{.underline}, are
[**directly [connected]{.mark}** [to **traditional**]{.mark}
**territorial [disagreements]{.mark}**[, and]{.mark}]{.underline} mostly
[[take the shape of]{.mark} **espionage and [low-level]{.mark}
disruptive [campaigns]{.mark}** [rather than]{.mark} **outright
[war]{.mark}fare**]{.underline}.

Given this data-based perspective, we question the dynamics of the cyber
security debate and offer a countering theory where [[states]{.mark} are
[restrain]{.mark}ed from using more malicious cyber actions [due
to]{.mark} the **[limited nature]{.mark} of the weapons**, **the
possibly of [blowback]{.mark}**, the [connection between]{.mark} the
digital world and civilian [infrastructure, and]{.mark} the
[reality]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[any]{.mark} cyber [weapon]{.mark}
launched [can be **replicated** and **used**]{.mark} **right
[back]{.mark} against the attacker**]{.underline}. Given all of these
perspectives gleamed from the data, [we must moderate our
views]{.underline} about the transformation that is offered by cyber
strategists who stress a more revolutionist tone (Lango, 2016).

[[Social science]{.underline}]{.mark} clearly
**[[matters]{.underline}]{.mark}** for contemporary technological policy
debates. [[Absent]{.mark} **rigorous [methods]{.mark}**]{.underline},
much of what is in [[the field is]{.underline}]{.mark} basically
**[[guesswork]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Our work really owes an
intellectual debt to J. David Singer, who started the effort to quantify
war at the University of Michigan with the Correlates of War (COW)
project (Small & Singer, 1982). Our project builds on this methodology
and uses many of the same coding strategies. We recognize that data is a
work in progress and seek to build more and more knowledge through
subsequent updates. By gathering the full picture, we can gain the
perspective that really matters in these emerging policy debates
regarding the cyber battlefield.

#### No large-scale cyber attacks or retaliation

University, "Global Cyber Conflicts Will Be Hard To Control", The

[The problem of perceptions and controlling escalation is not
new]{.underline}. In August 1914, the major European powers expected a
short and sharp "Third Balkan War." The troops were expected to be home
by Christmas. After the assassination of the Austrian archduke in June,
Austria-Hungary wanted to give Serbia a bloody nose, and Germany gave
its Austrian ally a blank check rather than see it humiliated. But when
the Kaiser returned from vacation at the end of July and discovered how
Austria had filled in the check, his efforts to de-escalate were too
late. Nonetheless, he expected to prevail and almost did.

Had the Kaiser, the Czar, and the Emperor known in August 1914 that a
little over four years later, all would lose their thrones and see their
realms dismembered, they would not have gone to war. Since 1945, nuclear
weapons have served as a crystal ball in which leaders can glimpse the
catastrophe implied by a major war. After the Cuban Missile Crisis in
1962, leaders learned the importance of de-escalation, arms-control
communication, and rules of the road to manage conflict.

Cyber technology, of course, lacks the clear devastating effects of
nuclear weapons, and that poses a different set of problems, because
there is no crystal ball. During the Cold War, the great powers avoided
direct engagement, but that is not true of cyber conflict. And yet [the
[threat of]{.mark} cyber **[Pearl Harbor]{.mark}**s [has been
**exaggerated**. Most]{.mark} cyber [conflicts occur **below the
threshold**]{.mark} established by the rules of armed conflict. They are
[**economic** and **political**, rather than **lethal**. It is **not
credible** to threaten]{.mark} a **[nuclear
response]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[to cyber theft]{.underline}]{.mark} of
intellectual property by China [[or]{.mark} cyber
[meddling]{.mark}]{.underline} in elections by Russia.

According to American doctrine, [deterrence is not limited to a cyber
response]{.underline} (though that is possible). [The [US will
respond]{.mark} to cyberattacks across domains or sectors, with any
weapons of its choice, [**proportional** to]{.mark} the [damage]{.mark}
that has been done. [That can range from]{.mark} **naming** and
[**shaming** to]{.mark} economic [sanctions]{.mark} to kinetic
weapons]{.underline}. Earlier this year, a new doctrine of "persistent
engagement" was described as not only disrupting attacks, but also
helping to reinforce deterrence. But the technical overlap between
intrusion into networks to gather intelligence or disrupt attacks and to
carry out offensive operations often makes it difficult to distinguish
between escalation and de-escalation. Rather than relying on tacit
bargaining, as proponents of "persistent engagement" sometimes
emphasize, explicit communication may be necessary to limit escalation.

In addition to the ways they are used,
[[cyber]{.mark}-operations]{.underline} also [have two]{.underline}
general [qualities that]{.underline} tend to [distinguish them from
conventional military operations]{.underline}. First, [they]{.underline}
typically [[have]{.mark} **[limited]{.mark}**]{.underline}, **[transient
[impact]{.mark}]{.underline}**---especially when compared with
conventional military action. As the Hoover Institute fellow Jacquelyn
Schneider recently told The New Yorker, "If you're already at a stage in
a conflict where you're willing to drop bombs, you're going to drop
bombs." Unlike traditional military hardware, [cyberweapons are
**virtual**]{.underline}: [[even]{.mark} [at]{.mark} their **[most
destructive]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [they [**rarely** have
**effects**]{.mark} in the **physical world**]{.underline}. In the
extraordinary instances when they do---such as the Stuxnet cyberattack,
which caused the centrifuges used to enrich uranium in Natanz, Iran, to
speed up or slow down---cyber-operations do not inflict the kind of
damage that can occur in even a minor precision missile strike. And
[[when states]{.mark} have [launched]{.mark} cyberattacks [against
**civilian infrastructure**]{.mark}]{.underline}, such as Russia's 2015
hit on Ukraine's power grid, [the [impact]{.mark} has been
**[short-lived]{.mark}**]{.underline}. To date, [[cyberattacks]{.mark}
have **[never caused direct]{.mark} physical
[harm]{.mark}**]{.underline}; the only known indirect death associated
with a cyberattack occurred in 2020, when a German patient with a
life-threatening condition died as a result of a treatment interruption
caused by a ransomware attack on a hospital's servers.

For the regular person on the street, the term 'cyber war' is more
likely to bring to mind the 1983 movie "WarGames" and the [[doomsday
articles]{.underline}]{.mark} that [appear regularly in the media
[about]{.mark} the '[cyber]{.mark} battlefield' and]{.underline} an
[impending [World War III]{.mark}]{.underline}. This essay argues that
[the threat of cyber war [is **exaggerated**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} although it can, by definition, be stated that we are
already in a state of cyber war, the impact on states is
**[negligible]{.underline}** compared to conventional war domains.

The argument is presented in 3 steps. The first step is to define cyber
war and cyber weapons, referencing scholars and experts in the area of
conventional war and the cyber domain. The second step is to explore who
has been exaggerating the threat of cyber war and what their motivations
might be. The third is to explore the evidence and quantify the
probability and impact that cyberwar has had on states to date.

'Cyber war' is a term often used interchangeably in media with
cyber-crime, cyber-attacks, cyber-conflict and cyber-incidents, creating
confusion amongst the public and scholars alike. Clausewitz (1989, 75),
in his book, On War, defines war as 'an act of force to compel the enemy
to do our will'. Rid (2012, 7) on the other interprets Clausewitz use of
'force' as meaning 'violent' force. According to Rid, if an act is not
potentially violent, it is not an act of war. However, Stone (2013, 107)
describes 'cyber war' as a politically motivated act of force, not
necessarily lethal and not necessarily attributable. The definition by
Powers and Jablonski states more simply that cyber war is the
utilisation of digital networks for geopolitical purposes (Nocetti 2016,
464). Neither of the latter two definitions requires violence to qualify
as cyber war. Under these definitions, the Stuxnet cyber-incident in
2010 and the Estonia incident in 2007 would constitute an act of cyber
war, and as such we could say that nations have been at cyber war in the
past and are likely to continue to engage in cyber war in years to come.

For this essay, I will use Stones definition to argue that even though
states may engage in cyber war, the concept of cyber war is exaggerated.
It seems that [cyber war is **deliberately exaggerated** [in]{.mark} the
[media and by politicians for **financial** and **political**
gains]{.mark}]{.underline}. There are countless examples in the media
and in politics of the exaggeration of the threat of cyber war and the
language used plays a big factor in creating a sense of fear in the
community.

The Four Corners report, Hacked, is a classic example where the
reporter, Andrew Fowler describes the current situation in Australia as
'... a secret war where the body count is climbing every day' (Fowler
2013). The documentary reveals nothing violent or lethal about cyber
incidents. The documentary is actually about hackers working from
locations overseas, having targeted key Federal Government departments
and major corporations in Australia.

In another example, NATO may be interpreted as exaggerating the threat
of Cyber War when they invited Charlie Millar to present at their
Conference for Cyber Conflict at the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence
Centre of Excellence in 2017. Millar is an independent security
evaluator, and his presentation was titled 'Kim Jong-il and me: How to
build a cyber army to attack the US'. He later presented similar content
at Def Con 2018. His presentation described the steps he would take to
mount a cyber war, including the types of people he would engage, how
much he would pay them, what his strategy would be and how much it would
cost in total.

Who stands to gain from the exaggeration and hype? Logically, [one group
would be those that gain financially from the sale of cyber protective
services and software]{.underline}. According to Valerino, 57% of
technical experts surveyed said that we are currently in a cyber arms
race and 43% said that the worst-case scenarios are inevitable
(Valeriano and Ryan 2015). Translate this into sales and Gartner
projects worldwide security spending will reach \$96 Billion in 2018, up
8 Percent from 2017 and to top \$113 billion by 2020 (Gartner 2017).

Additionally, [there may be **political motivations** to exaggerate the
threat of cyber war]{.underline}. Cyberspace is not well understood by
the general public and fear is natural. In the US's cyber security
debate, observers have noted there is a tendency for policymakers,
[military leaders, and media]{.underline}, among others, [to use
frightening 'cyber-doom scenarios' when making a case for action on
cyber security]{.underline} (Dunn 2008, 2).

There is some evidence to suggest that more recently in the political
arena; we may be maturing in our understanding of the real threat of
cyber war. The Tallinn Manual, an academic, non-binding study on how
international law applies to cyber conflicts and cyber warfare, was
written at the invitation of the Tallinn-based NATO Cooperative Cyber
Defence Centre of Excellence. It was first published in 2013 with the
title 'The Tallinn Manual on the International Law of Cyber War'. In
2017, it was re-released with the revised title 'Tallinn Manual 2.0 on
the International Law of Cyber Operations'. The change in title from
'war' to 'operations' signifies a more moderate use of language from
NATO and is an acknowledgement that cyber incidents generally fall below
the threshold at which International Law would declare them to be a
formal act of war. Experience over the 4 short years from 2013 to 2017
has demonstrated that cyber incidents tend to have a low-level impact on
the target state. As the book's authors put it 'the focus of the
original Manual was on the most severe cyber operations, those that
violate the prohibition of the use of force in international relations,
entitle states to exercise the right of self-defence, and/or occur
during armed conflict' while the new version 'adds a legal analysis of
the more common cyber incidents that states encounter on a day-to-day
basis and that fall below the thresholds of the use of force or armed
conflict' (Leetaru 2017).

To get a better sense if cyber war is exaggerated, we must also consider
the probability of cyber war in the future. The probability of cyber war
should be weighed up against the probability of conventional war. Where
tensions are already high, for example, between North Korea and the US
or Russia and Estonia, I would argue that cyber war is more likely than
conventional war. This is due to factors including; cyber warfare is
less costly than conventional warfare, states are less rational in their
decision space in the cyber realm, states find cyber attribution very
difficult to achieve so attacks can be undertaken covertly and cyber war
is considered 'a challenge' and central to the hackers' ethos (Junio
2013, 128). Further, Sanger describes in his book, The Perfect Weapon,
cyber weapons (such as cyber vandalism, Distributed Denial of Service
(DDOS), intrusions and advanced persistent threat (APT)) as the 'perfect
weapons' for the following reasons;

They are cheap: When compared to Nuclear weapons, there are only a
handful of nations globally that can afford the technology to create a
nuclear weapon.

They are easily accessible: Unlike a Nuclear bomb that requires uranium,
a highly protected metal, in the production process, a cyber weapon can
be created with minimal investment and highly available IT
infrastructure.

They can be dialled-up or dialled-down relatively easily. A ballistic
missile, the force of the explosion cannot be adjusted as easily as a
DDOS attack. A DDOS attack can be adjusted to last an hour, a few days
or a few weeks.

They have a huge range in how they are used: Sabotage as with Stuxnet,
Espionage as with the Chinese industrial spying on the US, North Korea's
infiltration of Sony, the Iranians attack on Las Vegas Sands Corp.
casino operators.

The significant factor is that cyber weapons can and are being used
every day for discrete, [[**low-level** cyber]{.mark}
conflicts]{.underline} to undermine and disrupt rivals, but historically
it [[has **not progressed** to]{.mark} open [conflict, nor]{.mark} has
it **[warranted]{.mark}** a **[military response]{.mark}**]{.underline}
(Sanger 2018). [Additionally, [massive]{.mark} cyber operations
[would]{.mark} necessarily impact the civilian population and
[violate]{.mark} the [immunity]{.mark} of non-combatants. The conditions
of war dictate that [this is **"taboo"** and]{.mark} to date, rival
[states]{.mark} have **[show]{.mark}n [restraint]{.mark}** in their use
of cyber weapons for this reason]{.underline} (Valeriano and Ryan 2015).
[It appears that [the threat]{.mark} that cyber weapons represent to
national security is overstated and the threat of cyber war [is
**overstated**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[The US and]{.underline} likely [other **highly [networked
nations]{.mark}** [appear **reticent**]{.mark}]{.underline} about using
cyber weapons for significant cyber conflict [[given]{.mark} their
**[vulnerabilities]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Ironically, NSA programs such
as PRISM have made the US more of a target given the sheer volume of
sensitive information stored in one place. Regardless of US defences,
there is no way to make this information completely secure from
intrusion, and as such, the very act of storing the information makes
them more vulnerable.

Rid (2012) is among some academics who argue that [[cyber
war]{.underline}]{.mark} has never and [[will]{.mark} likely **[never
eventuate]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The benefits of being on this side of
the debate mean that public funding can be allocated away from offensive
cyber security initiatives to other, potentially more important
initiatives, such as public health and housing. The government is
constantly under pressure to prioritise public spending and it is
imperative that they have realistic, accurate projections regarding the
risk of cyber war, the probability and the impact, to allow them to
focus spending on the most important areas.

### 2NC\-\--Defense\-\--AT: Escalation

#### No scenario for escalation. 

Erica D. **Borghard 19**, Assistant Professor in the Army Cyber
Institute at the United States Military Academy at West Point, and Shawn
W. Lonergan, Assistant Professor of International Relations in the
Department of Social Science at USMA, "Cyber Operations as Imperfect
Tools of Escalation", Strategic Studies Quarterly, Fall 2019, p. 123-124

However, [there are **important empirical reasons** to suspect that the
[risks of cyber escalation may be **exaggerated**]{.mark}. Specifically,
if cyberspace is in fact an environment that]{.underline} (perhaps even
more so than others) [generates severe escalation risks, [why
has]{.mark} cyber [escalation **not yet occurred**? Most]{.mark}
interactions between cyber rivals [have been]{.mark} characterized by
**[limited volleys]{.mark}** that have **[not]{.mark} escalated**
[beyond **nuisance levels**]{.mark} and have been largely [**contained**
below]{.mark} the [use-of-force]{.mark} threshold]{.underline}.5 For
example, in [a survey]{.underline} of cyber incidents and responses
between 2000 and 2014, Brandon Valeriano et al. [find that
"[rivals]{.mark}]{.underline} tend to [[respond only to
**lower-level**]{.mark} \[cyber\] [incidents an]{.mark}d the response
tends to **[check]{.mark} the [intrusion]{.mark}** as [opposed to seek
**escalation dominance**]{.mark}. The majority of cyber escalation
episodes are at a **low severity threshold** and are **non-escalatory**.
These incidents are usually **['tit-for- tat']{.mark}** type responses
[**within one step** of the]{.mark} original
[incident]{.mark}."]{.underline}6 [[Even in]{.mark} the **two [rare
examples]{.mark}** in which states [employed kinetic
force]{.mark}]{.underline} in response to adversary cyber
operations---the US counter-ISIL drone campaign in 2015 and Israel's
airstrike against Hamas cyber operatives in 2019---[the use of [force
was **circumscribed**]{.mark} and did **not escalate** the overall
conflict]{.underline} (not to mention that force was used against
nonstate adversaries with limited potential to meaningfully escalate in
response to US or Israeli force).7

We posit that [cyber escalation has not occurred because cyber
operations are **poor tools** of escalation]{.underline}. In particular,
we argue that [this stems from **key characteristics** of **offensive**
cyber capabilities that **limit escalation** through four mechanisms.
First, **[retal]{.mark}**iatory offensive cyber
**[op]{.mark}**eration**[s]{.mark}** may not exist at the **desired
time** of employment. Second, even under conditions where they may
exist, their [effects are **uncertain** and]{.mark} often relatively
**[limited]{.mark}**. Third, several attributes of offensive cyber
operations generate **important tradeoffs** for decision-makers that may
make them hesitant to employ capabilities in some
circumstances.]{.underline} [Finally, the alternative of
[**cross-domain** escalation]{.mark}]{.underline}---responding to a
cyber incident with noncyber, kinetic instruments---[[is
**unlikely**]{.mark} to be chosen except under **rare** circumstances,
[given]{.mark} the **[limited]{.mark} cost-generation
[potential]{.mark}** of offensive cyber operations]{.underline}. In this
article, we define cyber escalation and then explore the implications of
the technical features and requirements for offensive cyber operations.
We also consider potential alternative or critical responses to each of
these logics. Finally, we evaluate the implications for US policy
making.

[[To date, **no**]{.mark} **direct use**]{.underline} [of [OCO]{.mark}
capabilities has [resulted in]{.mark} the **outbreak** of
traditional]{.underline} **[[conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}**, perhaps
[[owing to **uncertainties**]{.mark} in the **[novelty]{.mark} of the
attacks**]{.underline}, [the difficulty of [**attribution**, and]{.mark}
the [reluctance]{.mark} of **national cyber actors [to
retaliate]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[when]{.mark} the path of
[**escalation** is **unclear**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Rid & Buchanan,
2015). [Most importantly]{.underline}, however, the actions of [armed
forces in democratic countries are constrained by]{.underline} the
**[rule of law]{.underline}**, which translates into multiple
authorities to ensure responsible and acceptable use, and safeguard
against escalation. The [fine-grained [control]{.mark} of
**OCOs**]{.underline} compared to conventional military force [provides
a way to **[manage escalation]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[without]{.mark}
the direct use of physical or military assets, whose effect in
**[sparking conflict]{.mark}** is **much better known**]{.underline}. In
other words, [[instead of]{.mark} reacting to an **[escalating]{.mark}
conflict**]{.underline} by deploying physical military assets to a
region, [[an OCO can be]{.mark} employed **[covert]{.mark}**ly to incur
more **[controllable]{.mark} costs**]{.underline} on the adversary, with
the benefit of plausible deniability (Hare, 2018). [Depending on the
type of OCO employed, if there is a reduction in tension, the effects of
the OCO can be [**reversed** or **scaled back**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

### 2NC\-\--Defense\-\--AT: Spills Over

#### Cyber-attacks don't [spillover]{.underline}. 

Martin **Libicki, 20** (Martin Libicki, Professor at the Frederick S.
Pardee RAND Graduate School, 5-20-2020, accessed on 7-18-2022, CATO
Institute, "Dealing With Cyberattacks",
[[https://www.cato.org/publications/dealing-cyberattacks]{.underline}](https://www.cato.org/publications/dealing-cyberattacks),
HBisevac)

The most [important justification for thinking about ***Las Vegas
rules*** [for cyberspace]{.mark}]{.underline} --- **[[what starts there
stays there]{.underline}]{.mark}** --- is that [the risks of
[escalation]{.mark} from cyberwarfare are **[much
lower]{.mark}**]{.underline} than the risks of escalation from kinetic
(violent) warfare. In the short run, an unprepared country can suffer
significant losses of information from a cyberwar. Against a
sufficiently sadistic and determined adversary, it is conceivable that
every infected personal computer can have the information on its hard
drive erased (as noted with Aramco and echoed in South Korea). But a
short‐​run response to a withering cyberattack that focuses on backing up
information and capabilities while eliminating unessential connectivity
(electric grids need not be connected to the Internet; they ran well
enough before the Internet was invented) could preserve most of a
country's functionality at the cost of annoyance.

In the longer run, cyberattacks are enabled by vulnerabilities in
software and architectural features in computer design that allow their
instruction sets to be altered. By contrast, the instruction sets of
most equipment are (or, until very recently, were) fixed when they leave
the factory. A computer that burned into its hardware all of its
instructions --- operating systems, office automation, Web browsing ---
would be hardened against malware. Although malware does not account for
all security breaches (e.g., South Carolina's exposure of all its tax
records to hackers),29 it is very much harder to cause serious damage
without it. Ultimately, [systems are only as vulnerable as **we want
them to be**]{.underline}: more accurately, only up to the level where
the inconvenience from restraining their malleability and accessibility
matches the risks from retaining that very malleability and
accessibility. For that reason, [a [tit for tat in cyberspace]{.mark}
can [escalate]{.mark} [to]{.mark} very [high levels **without creating
unlimited damage**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The [difficulty of finding
obvious firebreaks in cyberspace]{.underline} --- the point beyond which
no cyberattack on either side would go --- [is unfortunate but not
necessarily fatal]{.underline}. To wit, [an [all‐​out
cyberwar]{.mark}]{.underline} can be [[contained by]{.mark} the
[**nature** of **cyberspace**]{.mark} **[itself]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

#### No spillover\-\--empirics, it'll be confined to the cyber realm, lack of attribution, time cools off pressure, and kinetic deterrence.

Martin **Libicki '14** (Martin; 9/1/2014; PhD in economics from the
University of California Berkeley and Master's in city and regional
planning from the University of California Berkeley; "Is Cyberwar Good
for Peace? \[par Martin Libicki\],"

The assumption that cyberwar is a cool war also rests on the presumption
that what starts in cyberspace will stay in cyberspace; there will be no
escalation into kinetic conflict. Clearly the chance of escalation that
crosses domains is greater than zero, but [for cyber war to lose its
cool status requires that the risks of escalation into kinetic conflict
for a cyberattack be **substantially less** than]{.underline} similar
[risks associated with a comparable kinetic attack.]{.underline}
[The]{.underline} thin [[history we have]{.mark} of cyberattacks [**does
not suggest** that a cyberattack will]{.mark} necessarily [be followed
by **much of anything**]{.mark} **at all**.]{.underline} The
Russian\[11\] 2007 attacks on Estonia which crippled public and major
private web sites was followed by Estonia's complaints and NATO's
unwillingness to deem this an Article V attack (triggering collective
self-defense measures) but it led to nothing violent or even
close.\[12\] If Georgia had reacted kinetically to the cyberattacks on
it in 2008, it would have been difficult to distinguish such actions
from the war Georgia was forced to fight following its invasion by
Russian forces. [The 2007 Israeli air strike on a purported nuclear
facility in Syria may have been facilitated by an opening cyberattack on
Syrian air defenses but **[Syria did not respond]{.mark}** **at all** to
the cyberattack or the raid itself. [**Iran did not react kinetically**
to Stuxnet]{.mark}]{.underline}, even if it created cyberwar cadres that
may have been implicated in carrying out denial-of-service attacks on
banks\[13\] in the United States (from whence, supposedly, Stuxnet), but
also attacks which trashed computers in Saudi Arabia (specifically,
Aramco\[14\]) and Qatar (specifically, RasGas\[15\]), neither of which
could be plausibly accused of complicity in creating Stuxnet. Similarly,
the United States carried out no kinetic attack in response to the
aforementioned denial-of-service attacks on banks that its intelligence
community ascribed to Iran. To be fair, [[cyberattacks]{.mark}
unaccompanied by the outbreak of war [are]{.mark} **easier to
[like]{.mark}n to [a raid]{.mark}**]{.underline} than a war. In a raid,
forces cross borders, wreak their mischief, and go home. In a war, they
intend to stay permanently or turn what they have taken (be it territory
or the entire country) over to those they deem their allies. [[It
is]{.mark} very [**difficult of conceive** of a cyberattack that can
change the head of state]{.mark} and even harder to conceive of one that
can conquer all or even part of another country. In worst-case
scenarios, a cyberattack can disrupt life and maybe even break some
machines]{.underline}. But they do not persist unless the cost of
eradicating them -- for instance, by doing a system reboot, or replacing
infected machines with uninfected machines -- exceeds the cost of
tolerating their presence[. It is worth remembering that there is no
forced entry in cyberspace. Almost all wars tend to be two-side
engagements because the attacked side has no option but to fight or
surrender.]{.underline} In a raid, there is a third option to offer, at
most, some resistance but not pursue the attacker for fear of worse.
Thus, [not all raids lead to counter-raids.]{.underline} The
aforementioned 2007 Israeli raid on Syria did not. The many U.S. drone
strikes have not, so far. China invaded Vietnam in 1979, wreaked damage,
caused casualties, and departed having, in its mind, taught Vietnam a
lesson. Vietnam did not return the favor by invading China. Neither did
India in 1962 under similar circumstances. Granted, some nations do
respond. Arabs and Israelis traded raids in the decade or so after
Israel declared independence (1948); Palestinians and Israelis traded
attacks over the last three decades, as well. Both Koreas sent raiding
parties across the 38th parallel in the years prior to North Korea's
1950 invasion. [[The **history of raids escalating** into]{.mark} open
[conflict]{.mark} (as distinguished from raids preceding open conflict
as was the Korean case) [is]{.mark} also [thin]{.mark}.]{.underline} Two
other difficulties associated with attribution and the difficulties of
disarming the attacker are likely to reduce the pressure to retaliate,
much less, escalate in response to a cyberattack. [[Difficulties of
attribution are likely to have two]{.mark} related [effects]{.mark}. The
first is that [the target may not be]{.mark} so [certain]{.mark} about
who did it -- or at least not be certain of its ability to convince
third parties such as other countries who did it -- [to **validate a
response**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The second is that [[if it takes too
much time to analyze the attack]{.mark} to the point where it can
determine (and make the case about) who did it with the requisite
confidence, the **[political pressure for vengeance may have
cooled]{.mark}** and the politico-military situation that warranted
retaliation may have changed]{.underline} (e.g., yesterday's foe might
be today's partner). [[The impetus to respond can]{.mark} also [be
reduced if the public has little idea]{.mark} about the identity of the
attacker and even the fact of the attack (e.g., the failure to function
is not obvious to the outside). Until the New York Times reported on
Stuxnet, the public did not know that Iran had been
attacked]{.underline} (it is not clear whether anyone in Iran actually
understood that they were being attacked before it was reported). [If no
one knows that two parties are trading blows in the dark, [there
is]{.mark} **much [less requirement to appear strong]{.mark}** as a way
of establishing third-party deterrence. The **difficulty of disarming**
the other side's cyberwar capabilities removes another reason for
responding to a cyberattack.]{.underline} A kinetic response to a
kinetic attack can be justified, not only as a way to reinforce
deterrence, but also as a way to reduce the attacker's ability to carry
out further attacks; it does so by killing opposing forces and
destroying military equipment, ancillary supplies and infrastructure,
especially staging areas. [A cyber response can only be justified in
terms of deterrence because [it is]{.mark} **very [difficult]{.mark}**
[for a cyberattack to permanently]{.mark} or even temporarily [damage
the other side's ability]{.mark} to carry out cyberattacks, which
require little more than hackers, information, computing equipment,
software, and network connections.]{.underline}\[16\] Granted, the
target country may conclude that it may win some relief from cyberattack
by carrying out a kinetic attack on the attacker's cyberwar corps. Such
actions cannot be ruled out\[17\] --- but suffice it to say that at
least the tools of a cyberattack cannot be identified from afar in the
same way that the tools of a kinetic attack can be. Alternatively, the
target can convince itself that the only way to rid itself of the
cyberattack menace is to change the regime that governs the attacking
country. If the sole aim of such logic is to minimize the likelihood of
future damage to the target country, it can be convincing only by
substantially underestimating the cost and risk of war or substantially
overestimating the inconvenience associated with adopting other measures
to improve cyber-security. Finally, and in lieu of regime change, [the
escalation path from a cyberattack into a kinetic response also crosses
**a threshold that does not come up** when the original provocation and
the response were both kinetic. It is unclear whether this threshold is
more like a speed bump or a yawning abyss, but it is clearly present. It
should therefore seem obvious that [a cyberattack is **less likely to
result in a kinetic response**]{.mark} than an equivalent kinetic attack
would have]{.underline}. However, this raises the question of what
constitutes equivalence. Assessing kinetic damage when it is damage to
you is a straightforward exercise. Assessing the damage from a
cyberattack that leads to the widespread corruption of information
systems requires knowing what systems have, in fact, been corrupted
(something that, ironically, the attacker may have a better handle on).
A target country that has been spooked by a cyberattack into imagining
that the real damage is a multiple of the visible damage may well
overreact (at least initially until it realizes over time which of its
systems is or is not behaving as if they had been corrupted). In sum,
[although the risks of violent escalation following a cyberattack are
nonzero, the **odds are against it**, in isolation and particularly in
comparison to a kinetic attack of similar magnitude]{.underline}.

#### Deterrence in cyberspace [doesn't work]{.underline}.

In [attempts to **repel** the threat posed through
cyberspace]{.underline} or cyberwarfare, the
[[cyber]{.mark}security]{.underline} community, scholars, and
[[policy]{.underline}]{.mark}-circles in various nations, specifically
[in the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, [began to search for
**effective ways** of **safeguarding** cyber systems]{.underline}. [Out
of these efforts came **cyber deterrence theory**]{.underline}.
[[Treating]{.mark} the [cyber]{.mark} sphere [as]{.mark} a
**[warfighting]{.mark}**]{.underline} or operational
**[[domain]{.underline}]{.mark}**, various pundits applied the concepts
of classical deterrence to cyberspace in order to inform cyber
deterrence theory.

However, [not long after the employment of the **fundamental
principles** of]{.underline} Cold War [deterrence theories to
cyberspace]{.underline}, the [abundance of comments skeptical that
**conventional**]{.underline} nuclear and military [**deterrence**
**theories** were **applicable** to cyberwarfare made numerous scholars
**doubt** the **efficacy** of cyber deterrence]{.underline}. In parallel
to this increased skepticism, many came to the realization that the
[[complexity]{.mark} of cyberspace]{.underline} and, for that matter,
cyberwar, [**did [not allow]{.mark}** a **[successful]{.mark}
[application]{.mark}** [of]{.mark}]{.underline} Cold War [deterrence
[theories]{.mark}]{.underline}, particularly deterrence-by-punishment
and deterrence-by-denial, to the cyber realm. This is [because [when it
comes to]{.mark} **[cyberwarfare]{.mark}**]{.underline}, the [very
**[fundamental]{.mark}** and necessary **[elements]{.mark}** [of]{.mark}
classical [deterrence]{.mark}]{.underline}, [namely
**credibility**]{.underline}, **[capability]{.underline}**, [and
**communication**]{.underline} of menacing massages to the would-be
challenger, [are [not]{.mark} [present]{.mark} due to the **distinctive
characteristics** of cyberspace]{.underline}. Of those intrinsic
characteristics, the most articulated ones are the
[**[ambiguity]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} the source of
[attacks]{.mark}]{.underline}, the [**anonymity** of the]{.underline}
potential [cyber offender]{.underline}, [high technological
**volatility**]{.underline}, the [**ubiquity** of computer networks and
systems]{.underline}, the [**[asymmetric]{.mark}**]{.underline} and
complex [**[nature]{.mark}** of cyberspace]{.underline},
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} finally the [**[immaturity]{.mark}**
[of]{.mark} **[i]{.mark}**]{.underline}nternational
**[[laws]{.underline}]{.mark}**, rules, [and norms]{.underline}. For
example, the credibility of deterrence by punishment is undermined due
to the difficulty of attributing the source of the attack, the anonymity
of the potential attacker, and the asymmetry between the defending party
and the challenger. Similarly, the inadequacy of international rules and
norms that define an appropriate code of conduct in cyberspace, [the
lack of cross-borders cooperation for the investigation of
cybercrimes]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} the [[absence]{.mark}
[of]{.mark} international [configurations]{.mark}]{.underline} for
inspection purposes [[render]{.mark} **[credibility]{.mark}** and
**communication** [of]{.mark} [cyber deterrence]{.mark}
**[ineffective]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Therefore, there is a common
perception in the pertinent literature that cyberspace ought to be
approached on its own merit; it has distinctive characteristics that
render the Cold War deterrence theories ill-suited for cyberspace.

In the wake of this skepticism, different strategies and policy
constructs have been deliberately considered to increase the efficacy of
cyber deterrence. On the one hand, some have suggested the application
of serial deterrence, expanded deterrence, tailored deterrence, active
defense, and deterring specific cyber weapons in addition to deterrence
by kinetic means. Even, re-configuring the very architecture of the
Internet has been suggested. On the other hand, others take a
constructivist approach and focus more on human factors and, for that
matter, the social construction of cyber threat perception rather than
on technical difficulties of the cyber domain.

However, the problem with the existing literature is that the vast
volume of the studies usually analyzed the efficacy of cyber deterrence
within the theoretical framework of classical deterrence and technical
vulnerabilities in cyber systems. The bulk of these studies lacked a
rigorous theoretical perspective because they were from policy-circles
and because historical cyber incidents are insufficient to develop an
independent cyber-based theory. This theory-policy vacuum is more
evident in regards with doomsday scenarios, specifically in the context
of cyberwar between the U.S. and China. Although some scholars have
provided useful insights into potential cyberwarfare scenarios between
China and the U.S., particularly over the issue of Taiwan, these
insights suffered significantly from a lack of a robust theoretical
approach. Thus, the purpose of this study has been to address the issue
outside the limits of classical deterrence and vulnerabilities in
networks and systems, and to bridge this theory-policy gap by examining
the effectiveness of cyber deterrence between the U.S. and China through
the lens of Power Transition Theory.

Power Transition Theory is relevant to the discussion on cyberwarfare
and cyber deterrence for two main reasons. First, because PTT is a
probabilistic theory that explains under what conditions power
transition from the dominant power to the rising challenger is likely to
lead to a system-wide war in the real world, it can be a useful
theoretical framework for the examination of the success or failure of
cyber deterrence in preventing cyberwar between China and the United
States. Second, the relevancy of PTT lies in the fact that Cold War
classical deterrence is the very basis for cyber deterrence theory while
PTT has been critical of some tenets of classical deterrence. So, this
makes PTT relevant to the analysis here.

PTT contends that the classical deterrence concept of MAD did not make
war prohibitive; but, instead, nuclear war did not occur because the
USSR never approached national power parity with the U.S. before its
dissolution. In PTT, power parity between the preeminent nation and the
challenger is one of the required conditions that ought to be present
prior to the outbreak of power transition warfare. In fact, according to
PTT, there are several critical variables that dictate the success of
deterrence. The challenger's level of satisfaction with the status quo
and whether it has reached power parity with the dominant power,
however, have the utmost importance and pertinence to this study.

[Applying **PTT** to cyberspace]{.underline}, the [theory would suggest
that [cyber deterrence]{.mark} [in]{.mark} the context of
**[cyberwar]{.mark}**]{.underline} between China and the U.S. [will be
**[tenuous]{.mark}** under the simultaneous presence of the **two
conditions**]{.underline}. Once China achieves parity in cyber offensive
warfare capabilities with the U.S. while, at the same time, remaining
discontented with the existing status quo in cyberspace, China will not
be deterred and, rather, will become a risk-taker trying to alter the
order in cyberspace in its favor. This would cause cyber deterrence to
fail, making cyberwar very likely. After analysis of China's
satisfaction level with the prevailing status quo in the cyber sphere
and its relative cyber-offense power to that of the U.S., this study
concludes that [[while China]{.mark} notably [exhibits]{.mark} a certain
level of **[dissatisfaction]{.mark}** [with]{.mark} the
**[international]{.mark} cyber [system]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [it seems
[not]{.mark} to have [approached]{.mark} a **[parity]{.mark}**
[of]{.mark} offensive cyber [capabilities]{.mark} with the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates. China falls far behind the
U.S. in terms of cyber offensive warfare power. Hence, [[China]{.mark}
is **[tenuously deterred]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As a corollary of this,
this study contends that an outbreak of cyberwar between the U.S. and
China is a remote possibility in the foreseeable future.

#### Cyber deterrence models [fail horribly]{.underline}.

https://www.researchgate.net/publication/345343913_Optimizing_Cyber_Deterrence,
HBisevac)

The aim of this chapter has been to show that [**[maximizing]{.mark}**
one type of **deterrent**]{.underline}, say [the ability to
[punish]{.mark} aggression via retaliation]{.underline}, actually
[[**undermines**]{.mark} the **[strength]{.mark}** [of]{.mark}
[deterrence]{.mark} [by]{.mark} **[denial]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[[No]{.mark} **[analogous interdependencies]{.mark} exist** [in
nuc]{.mark}lear [deterrence]{.mark}]{.underline}. The policy
implications of this difference are non-trivial. [[Policy makers]{.mark}
[need]{.mark} to [think]{.mark} more [in]{.mark} **complex [system
terms]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[rather than]{.mark} in terms of **linear
aggregations**]{.underline}. Choosing to hoard zero-day vulnerabilities
might be the best deterrent option, but [[hoarding]{.mark} every
discovered **[vulnerability]{.mark}** will]{.underline}, at some point,
[**[harm]{.mark}** the ability to impose **[costs]{.mark}** on a
**potential adversary** via denial]{.underline}. Maximizing cyber
deterrence, in other words, is really about optimizing the various
inputs to the nation's deterrent. A few implications are particularly
interesting for both policy makers and those doing research on cyber
deterrence. The first is that the interdependencies outlined here are
likely only half of the equation. Each set of linkages above showed how
increasing one means of deterrence could draw down another in some
measure, effectively creating negative interdependencies. Yet positive
interdependencies also likely exist. For example, increasing the
resilience of a nation's networks might increase deterrence by denial,
but it would also likely help to develop a norm of non-use (since fewer
attacks might happen) and increase deterrence by taboo. These positive
interdependencies make the issue of optimization even more important, as
they could fundamentally change the cost-benefit calculus for policy
makers. Another implication of note is the likely lack of symmetry in
the interdependencies between means of deterrence. In each case above, a
plausible argument could be made for the idea that increasing one
reduces the other and vis-a-versa. However, it is by no means as clear
that the relationships are symmetrical. Increasing cyber deterrence via
hoarding 10 percent more zerodays could reduce the effectiveness of
deterrence by denial by 2 percent (20% of 10 %). Conversely, [disclosing
**10 percent** more **vulnerabilities** to vendors might not reduce the
effectiveness of deterrence by threat of **retaliation** by an
**equivalent amount**]{.underline}. Similar changes to one form of
deterrence, in other words, might have dissimilar effects on the other
types. Lastly, [there is a **[highly]{.mark} [probable]{.mark}** state
of **[non-linearity]{.mark}** at play]{.underline}. [[Complex
systems]{.mark} are [**marked** by **non-linear
moves**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [either discrete, logarithmic or
exponential]{.underline}. **[[Small changes]{.underline}]{.mark}** to
one of the means of deterrence might, therefore, [result
[in]{.mark}]{.underline} initially small changes in another category.
But the next set of equivalently small changes might suddenly start to
matter a lot more, as non-[[linear]{.mark} [effects]{.mark} build [in
the system]{.mark}]{.underline}. Overall, the chapter is meant as a
foundation for subsequent research and policy development. Recognizing
that input maximization cannot lead to maximal cyber deterrence is
important. Moving from this recognition via a deliberate process of
simulatiolaan and optimization is the essential next step that will
require civilian-military coordination, data analytics and trial and
error. As more physical systems become integrated into cyberspace, [the
[price of failure]{.mark} will [**continue** to
**increase**]{.mark}]{.underline} and the need to get cyber deterrence
right grows ever more important.

## 3D Printing Bad

### 3D Printing Bad\-\--1NC

#### 3-D printing causes rogue state WMD prolif.

[The current strategies for preventing the use of WMD by non-state
actors have been predicated upon the idea that these groups lacked the
technical expertise and infrastructure necessary for their
construction]{.underline}. Barriers to fabrication allowed for a
singular focus on states as the source of these types of weapons even as
the aims of terrorist organizations evolved and the ability to inflict
widespread destruction and mass casualties became operational goals.
[Current advances in the technology of additive manufacturing
are]{.underline} already [beginning to erode these restrictions and
challenge non-proliferation regimes]{.underline}. Though holding promise
for incredible advancements in areas of such as medicine, [as 3-D
printing evolves]{.underline} to the point where it can be used for the
fabrication of more intricate structures, [it]{.underline} also [may
enhance the ability of non-state actors to threaten states with the use
of WMD]{.underline}. While the most significant developments are still
some time away, it is not too early for states to begin assessing how to
begin harnessing the benefits of these processes while countering their
ability to be used for destructive purposes. Th[e creation of effective
security strategies to harness 3-D printing will be
difficult,]{.underline} [and]{.underline} is [fraught with technical and
legal hurdles]{.underline}. In the short term, such policies will likely
continue to focus on preventing the procurement of base materials used
in the manufacture of these weapons by non-sanctioned groups. As the
requirement for specific compounds decreases with printers that can
synthesize new material from base elements, these strategies will likely
be replaced by attempts at controlling hardware itself. [The ultimate
challenge for states]{.underline}, however, [is going to be preventing
the dissemination of the blueprints necessary for the construction of
WMD using 3-D technology]{.underline}. With numerous legitimate
commercial and household purposes, [printers of this nature may become
as ubiquitous as laser and inkjet printers are today]{.underline}. [Once
the technology has become a part of everyday life and widely available,
controlling the hardware may be an insurmountable task]{.underline}. At
that point, [governments may find themselves in the unenviable position
of enforcing regulations preventing the spread of instructions for the
production of WMD, a herculean task in the age of digital transmissions
and instantaneous data sharing]{.underline}.

#### 3-D printers are bad\-\-- laundry list.

Lyndsey **Gilpin** 03-05-20**14** \[Lyndsey Gilpin is a former Staff
Writer for TechRepublic, covering sustainability and entrepreneurship,
Tech Republic, "The dark side of 3D printing: 10 things to watch,"
https://www.techrepublic.com/article/the-dark-side-of-3d-printing-10-things-to-watch///ZW\]

As with any new technology, [it's easy to get swept up in the benefits
of 3D printing]{.underline}. It opens up a world of new possibilities
for all industries, and stands to lessen transportation costs,
environmental impacts, waste, and reliance on corporations by enabling
the maker movement. [But 3D printers are still potentially hazardous,
wasteful machines, and their societal, political, economic, and
environmental impacts have not yet been studied
extensively]{.underline}. To make sure you aren't thrown off guard by
the conversations to come, we've compiled a list of 10 things you need
to know about the dangers and potentially negative impacts of 3D
printers. 1[. 3D printers are energy hogs When melting plastic with heat
or lasers, 3D printers consume about 50 to 100 times more electrical
energy than injection molding to make an item of the same
weight]{.underline}, according to research by Loughborough University.
In 2009, research at MIT's Environmentally Benign Manufacturing program
showed that laser direct metal deposition (where metal powder is fused
together) used hundreds of times the electricity as traditional casting
or machining. Because of this, 3D printers are better for small batch
runs. [Industrial-sized 3D printers may not be the answer to lessening
our use of coal power any time soon]{.underline}. 2. [Unhealthy air
emissions 3D printers may pose a health risk]{.underline} when used in
the home, according to researchers at the Illinois Institute of
Technology. [The emissions from desktop 3D printers are similar to
burning a cigarette or cooking on a gas or electric stove]{.underline}.
The 2013 study was the first to measure these airborne particle
emissions from desktop 3D printers. [While heating the plastic and
printing small figures, the machines using PLA filament emitted 20
billion ultrafine particles per minute]{.underline}, and the ABS emitted
up to 200 billion particles per minute. [These particles can settle in
the lungs or the bloodstream and pose health risk]{.underline},
especially for those with asthma. 3. [Reliance on plastics]{.underline}
One of the biggest environmental movements in recent history has been to
reduce reliance on plastics, from grocery bags to water bottles to
household objects that can be made from recycled materials instead. The
most popular---and cheapest---[3D printers use plastic
filament]{.underline}. Though using raw materials reduces the amount of
waste in general, the machines still leave unused or excess plastic in
the print beds. PLA is biodegradable, but ABS filament is still the most
commonly used type of plastic. The plastic byproduct ends up in
landfills. If 3D printing is going to be industrialized, that byproduct
or other recycled plastic needs to be reused. 4. IP and licensing deals
In January, 3D Systems acquired Gentle Giant Ltd., which owned the
licensing rights to toy franchises such as The Hobbit, The Walking Dead,
Harry Potter, Alien, and Star Wars. Gartner has said that companies may
lose at least \$100 billion in four years to licensing or IP owners. 3D
printing will change the business market---and the black market for
these items---and the legislation will have to rush to catch up. This
potential digital piracy situation is comparable to the way the internet
challenged the movie and music industries for copyrights, trademarks,
and illegal downloads. 5. [Gun control loopholes]{.underline} The first
successful [3D printed gun]{.underline} is old news, but its
[ramifications are very important]{.underline}. [Companies are popping
up around the world, attempting to sell these guns]{.underline} and/or
the CAD designs for them. Engineering firm Solid Concepts has even fired
rounds out of the first 3D printed metal gun. [Congress' Undetectable
Firearms Act, which bans guns that can't be detected by metal detectors
or x-ray scanners]{.underline}, was renewed for 10 years. It [left a
loophole in the law]{.underline}, however: 3D printed guns with a tiny
piece of metal aren't banned by the Act. Legislators are attempting to
close that loophole now, after Congress ignored the issue for quite some
time, with special requirements for printed guns. 6. [Responsibility of
manufacturers]{.underline} [Weapons can be 3D printed]{.underline}. So
can safety equipment such as helmets, wheels for bikes, and toys for
small children. Of course there is the issue of intellectual property
and trademark, but the larger issue involves responsibility. If a person
shoots a gun and harms or kills someone, stabs someone with a 3D printed
knife, or breaks their neck while riding on a bike with a 3D printed
helmet, who is held accountable? The owner of the printer, the
manufacturer of the printer, or the irresponsible person who thought it
was a good idea to produce and use an untested product? 7. [Bioprinting
ethics and regulation]{.underline} The conversations about the ethics of
bioprinting have already begun. Organovo is printing liver cells as well
as eye tissue cells in a partnership with the National Eye Institute and
National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences. [Scientists have
also proposed mixing human stem cells with canine muscle cells to create
enhanced organ tissue]{.underline}. Printing cartilage is still the most
realistic type of bioprinting, and printing whole organs is still many
years away, but 3D printing is growing in medicine quite rapidly.
[Conversations]{.underline} about the moral, ethical, and legal issues
surrounding bioprinting have started, but they [will inevitably cause a
lot more controversy]{.underline} as it becomes more commonplace. 8.
Possibility of [3D printed drugs]{.underline} [Assembling chemical
compounds on a molecular level using a 3D printer is
possible.]{.underline} A researcher at the University of Glasglow
created a prototype of a 3D "Chemputer" that makes drugs and medicine.
He wants to revolutionize the pharmaceutical industry by allowing
patients to print their own medicine with a chemical blueprint they get
from the pharmacy. Of course, this is a very long way off, but it
[stands to enable DIY chemists to create anything from cocaine to
ricin]{.underline}. 9. [National security risks]{.underline} [A white
paper released from the National Defense University highlighted national
security risks from 3D printing technology]{.underline}. Since there
will be significant legal and economic implications on the business
sector and 3D printers offer the ability to produce a wide range of
objects that cannot be controlled yet, the paper noted that there are
definitely national security risks that need to be analyzed in the near
future. 10. Safety of items that come into contact with foodYou can
print out a fork or spoon with your MakerBot, but if you use ABS
plastic, it is not BPA-free. Luckily, new filaments that are safer to
put in your mouth are being created for this specific reason, but they
aren't widely available yet. Many 3D printers have spaces where bacteria
can easily grow if they aren't cleaned properly, as well. In order to
more safely-produced 3D printed food and kitchenware, there may be a
need for an FDA-approved machine. People probably don't want to eat
genetically-engineered pizza off of toxic plates.

### 3D Printing Bad\-\--2NC

#### Regulations won't work\-\-- existing state regimes will be circumvented.

Daniel C. **Tirone and** James **Gilley** 11-22-**15** \[Tirone is in
the Department of Political Science, Louisiana State University, Gilley

[Advancements in the printing of conventional weapons pose many of the
same challenges to existing firearm control regimes as the potential
advances in the printing of WMD do for counter-proliferation
strategies]{.underline}. In the USA, for example, a key principle of gun
control focuses on the point of sale, requiring background checks for
potential purchasers. Since production of high-quality firearms is
beyond the capability of most gun users and is instead undertaken by
professional manufacturers who then sell their weapons through
retailers, this strategy relies on established networks to keep track of
weapons in private hands as a means to prevent the sale of weapons to
those individuals whose ownership of a gun may be judged to pose a
threat to society. When individuals can fabricate their own firearms at
the household level, however, this line of oversight is removed.
Similarly, [when individuals or groups can engage in the manufacturing
of WMD without the need for state support]{.underline}, [the existing
regimes]{.underline}---which as discussed previously largely focus on
preventing WMD produced by states from being transferred to non-state
actors---[can be circumvented]{.underline}. For example, [efforts based
on safeguarding weapons stockpiles or interdicting WMD at the border
will be severely compromised by the ability of groups to print their own
weapons within a state\'s borders beyond the watchful eyes of
international weapons inspectors and allowing them to bypass customs
safeguards]{.underline}. [The ability to produce weapons outside of
traditional fabrication channels also carries additional challenges for
traditional weapons control regimes]{.underline}. One way states can
discover covert programs to develop WMD is to look for common
signatures. For example, states may monitor patterns of material and
equipment imports into a rival to see if patterns associated with
chemicals weapons production are present (US Congress, Office of
Technology Assessment, 1993, pp. 38--10). Similarly, they might look for
facilities which exhibit excessive levels of secrecy or security, or
plants which are inconsistent with the general level of development of a
country\'s industry, as possible signals of a biological weapons program
(pp. 103--104). [When WMD can be manufactured without the activities
commonly associated with their production, the anonymity it provides
would remove another channel by which foreign powers may intervene to
mitigate the threat]{.underline}.^12^ For these reasons, [advancements
in additive manufacturing capabilities require a similar evolution in
state security strategies]{.underline}. What these changes may look like
will depend on the state of the technology, which allows us to separate
strategies which may be effective in the near term from those which may
be required further into the future.

#### Online instructions for weapons building will be impossible to erase.

Daniel C. **Tirone and** James **Gilley** 11-22-**15** \[Tirone is in

https://doi.org/10.1080/18335330.2015.1089636//ZW\]

A[ttempts to limit the capabilities of printers are even
trickier]{.underline}. [Often]{.underline}, [when a technological
solution is attempted in order to lock material]{.underline}, [it is
quickly and easily subverted by individuals who disagree with the
restrictions]{.underline} aimed at controlling how it may be used.
[These solutions are subsequently passed on to other parties who also
have a stake in unlocking the devices.]{.underline} A simple example
comes from Sony\'s attempts to impose a Digital Rights Management regime
on audio CDs by Sony with their Key2Audio solution in 2002
(Rohde, 2001). This attempt to limit the copying of audio CDs onto
computers was found to be quickly undone with a simple felt tipped pen
run around the rim of the CD.^13^

Despite their potential limitations, strategies focusing on the hardware
involved in additive manufacturing hold more promise than the options
available for countering the other major threat which will develop with
advances in the technology. [As the ability to manufacture these weapons
at the household level increases, information itself will become a
threat to security. The publication of instructions on how to produce
weapons is not new]{.underline}; such information has been around in
various forms for some time, including the well-known example from the
1970s of the *Anarchist Cookbook* and its web-based
successors.^14^ [However, the utility of these instructions, even when
publicly available, were largely limited by the ability of the end user
to construct the final product]{.underline}. [A lack of resources and
technical expertise meant that all but the most rudimentary plans were
beyond the capabilities of most]{.underline}, if not all, individuals
who might be [inclined to construct weapons]{.underline} based on
information found online or in other forums. [Once these barriers have
been removed by a]{.underline} technology which requires nothing more
than widely available inputs and the possession of a [3-D
printer]{.underline}, [creating and distributing programs facilitating
the production of WMD will put these weapons within the reach of any
willing consumer]{.underline}. Once it has made its way onto a public or
private electronic platform, [these plans will be largely beyond the
capabilities of governments and other regulators to
eradicate]{.underline}. Even if they are successful in removing them
from widely available sites, [they will likely be beyond their reach in
the recesses of the 'dark web' and peer to peer file networking sites,
which find multiple alternatives emerging whenever a single site is
removed]{.underline}.

[The most dramatic near-term developments effecting the overall WMD
threat picture are]{.underline}, however, [likely to relate to the
acquisition, production and weaponization of CBRN agents]{.underline}.
[A variety of technological trends]{.underline}, from miniaturization of
manufacturing and turn-key systems to rapid prototyping and marginal
cost reproduction---[e.g. 3-D printing]{.underline}---[could facilitate
the production of WMD]{.underline}. [In the past, producing sufficient
amounts of nerve agent to constitute a chemical WMD required large
equipment and dangerous reactants to be set up and monitored by
experienced chemical engineers]{.underline}, [with a dangerous leak or
explosion a constant concern]{.underline}. [The advent of new
technologies like chemical microreactors]{.underline} (where precursor
chemicals are combined under controlled conditions in miniature channels
on a "chip") [could allow for self-contained production of small
quantities of CW in a basement]{.underline}, [with almost no hazard and
far less vulnerability to detection by authorities]{.underline}.
Stringing several of these modules together and operating them for
extended periods, could still yield sufficient quantities for the
desired level of mayhem. Another example is biotechnology "kits" that
take much of the technical guesswork out of complex microbiological
procedures and are even being marketed to high-schoolers.39 [This
phenomenon likely will eventually lead to WMD that can be produced more
cheaply, more safely, and with a smaller operational
footprint]{.underline}. [For terrorists and other VNSAs]{.underline},
such [developments will serve only to lengthen Archimedes' proverbial
lever when it comes to their asymmetric effects versus their state
opponents.]{.underline}

[What is additive manufacturing and how might this emerging technology
change the future of nuclear proliferation]{.underline}? This section
reviews the technical features of the new production platform to
identify how it promises to improve upon the existing pool of
technologies used by nuclear programmes. [Nuclear weapon states and
civil nuclear suppliers are adopting the technology because it offers a
more versatile and cost-effective way to fabricate components with
complex designs that could not be made before with traditional
methods]{.underline}. [The concern is that these same benefits could
turn into proliferation liabilities if the technology expands nuclear
production options while blurring the distinction between peaceful and
military applications]{.underline}. Additive manufacturing refers to a
family of production technologies with two unique features.^21^ The
first is the additive process of fabrication, whereby an object is built
by laying down successive layers of material. This new principle stands
in contrast to subtractive methods of manufacturing that use various
cutting tools -- such as lathes, mills and grinders -- to remove
material from a larger object. By building objects from scratch,
additive manufacturing provides the ability to make components with
complex geometries and special characteristics simply not possible
before with subtractive machine tools. Many of the top aerospace,
defence and nuclear firms are therefore adopting additive manufacturing
to expand the available menu of production options. Second, additive
manufacturing represents a leap forward in automation and supply chain
optimisation because it leverages robotics, computation and network
connectivity to fabricate components from digital build files. These
blueprints contain the all of the design information needed to produce a
final component, as well as the commands and specifications that guide
the automated fabrication process itself.^22^ This type of
cyber-physical manufacturing builds upon the previous generation of
computer numeric controlled (CNC) subtractive machine tools, which still
require skilled machinists with deep experience to operate. The ultimate
goal of additive manufacturing is to capture this tacit knowledge in the
digital realm, where it can be automated, saved and even transmitted to
distant locations, thereby enabling parts to be printed on demand
wherever needed. As a result, the digital nature of the technology
promises to shrink down or even eliminate global logistics and supply
chains. [The taproot of the proliferation problem is that additive
manufacturing is already being adopted by nuclear programmes to reap
similar benefits.]{.underline} The nuclear laboratory complex in the
United States is pioneering the adoption of AM because it believes the
technology 'could have broad impact across \[nuclear\] weapons
components and materials.'^23^ [Other nuclear weapons enterprises may be
investing in the technology as well]{.underline}.^24^ On the civil
nuclear energy side of the coin, enterprises in the United States, South
Korea, Russia and China are exploring ways to integrate the technology
into production lines. Early efforts are underway to fabricate the
critical components at the heart of a nuclear reactor, from methods for
3D-printing nuclear fuel at Idaho National Lab to large metallic
pressure vessels by the Chinese National Nuclear Corporation.^25^
Additive manufacturing offers these nuclear programmes an agile and
efficient means of production, especially amid supply chain atrophy in
the United States and Europe.^26^ Small batches of reactor components,
for instance, can be difficult and expensive to source if they are
produced using traditional methods, as producers often need long lead
times to establish processes for forging and casting parts.^27^ In stark
contrast, additive manufacturing plants can be quickly repurposed to
fabricate parts without retooling production lines or interpreting
designs.^28^ The ultimate goal is to leverage the digital nature of the
technology to print nuclear certified parts, thereby reducing quality
control concerns.^29^ If additive manufacturing technology continues to
mature along its current trajectory, it could help lower the massive
costs associated with new nuclear reactor projects or stockpile
stewardship by providing a steady-state capacity to produce a wide range
of certified nuclear components on demand. [The concern is that these
same features of additive manufacturing could enhance clandestine
proliferation while making it difficult to verify the peaceful nature of
nuclear energy programmes]{.underline}. [For nuclear weapons-aspirants,
this new production technology holds the promise of maturing in ways
that]{.underline} (1) [lower the barriers to entry]{.underline}, (2)
[accelerate and augment traditional development pathways,
and]{.underline} (3) [subvert detection and export
controls]{.underline}. First, [additive manufacturing could
'significantly reduce the expert knowledge required to produce dual-use
parts, as an increasing amount can be coded into digital build
files]{.underline}.'^30^ One non-proliferation assessment concluded
that, '[the only true barriers to operationalizing 3D printing for the
manufacture of illicit items involve obtaining the 3D printers
themselves, the materials used in 3D printing, and the sensitive
\[digital build files\].]{.underline}'^31^ [Theft or transfer of these
digital files could spread far more information about sensitive nuclear
components than traditional blueprints]{.underline}. Second, [additive
manufacturing could shrink down development timelines or expand options
for the production and weaponisation of fissile material]{.underline}.
One of the main benefits of the technology is that it 'promises to
reduce lead times due to its ability to rapidly produce prototypes,
facilitating testing and design processes.'^32^ Nuclear programmes could
therefore accelerate the lengthy process of building up tacit knowledge
and mastering production processes. Third, [additive manufacturing could
erode architectures for monitoring and regulating nuclear
technology]{.underline}.^33^ In facilities equipped with additive
manufacturing, for instance, '[it is less obvious what is actually being
built in comparison to a factory with subtractive tools, where casting
molds or special tools are being used]{.underline}.'^34^ [The digital
nature of 3D-printing is even more worrisome, as it offers the
'potential to produce any physical object based on technical data in the
form of build files]{.underline}. These can be easily transferred using
email or other means of electronic communication that are hard for
authorities to detect and prevent.'^35^ [Additive manufacturing could
therefore 'subvert traditional nodes of trade in the physical commodity
supply chain or alter the ways that dual-use technology, knowledge, and
skills are transferred around the world.]{.underline}'^36^ If illicit
procurement networks exploit the technology to hide more deception
points among commercial activities, [it may become difficult to identify
peaceful patterns of nuclear trade]{.underline}. [Such a breakdown in
export controls and intelligence 'could both allow an undesirable
transfer to take place and prevent the collection of information that
could be used for verification purposes]{.underline}.'^37^ [As a result,
the integration of digital 3D-printing into above-board supply chains
could erode confidence in peaceful commitments by nuclear energy
programmes]{.underline}.

#### 3D printers release toxic particles and are bad for the environment.

Misha **Gajewski** 12-15-20**20** \[freelance journalist and a
journalism professor at Seneca College, Forbes, "3D Printers May Be
Toxic to Humans,"
https://www.forbes.com/sites/mishagajewski/2020/12/15/3d-printers-may-be-toxic-to-humans/?sh=5d9f8f044338//ZW\]

[Several new studies found that 3D printers emit toxic
particles]{.underline} that may be [harmful to humans]{.underline}. [The
studies]{.underline}, presented at the 2020 Society for Risk Analysis
virtual Annual Meeting on December 15, [showed that the particles
released during the printing process can affect indoor air quality and
public health]{.underline}. For the uninitiated, [3D printers typically
work by melting plastic filaments]{.underline} or other base materials
such as nanoparticles, metals, thermoplastics etc. [and then stacking
the melted materials layer upon layer to form an object]{.underline}.
[When the plastic or other base materials are heated to melt they
release volatile compounds into the air near the printer and the
object]{.underline}. [The chemical by-products and particles that are
released into the environment during the printing process can build up
the longer the process takes and some are small enough that they can
infiltrate the lungs, causing damage]{.underline}. The studies presented
today at the meeting looked at various types of emissions and how great
the risk is. For example, [two of the studies from the]{.underline}
Environmental Protection Agency ([EPA]{.underline}) [analyzed the
emissions from a 3D printer filament extruder]{.underline} - a device
used to create 3D printer filaments - and then used a simulation model
to see how many particles were produced, as well as where they were
deposited when using a 3D printer in different age groups. The studies
[found that the filament extruder released amounts of small particles
and vapors similar to those found in other studies of 3D
printers,]{.underline} and the simulation model predicted higher
deposition of particle mass per surface area in the lungs for children
ages nine and younger. But more research is needed to determine how much
the inhaled dose would be. [Another one of the studies
presented]{.underline}, conducted by Yong Qian from the National
Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, [looked at the potential
toxicity of]{.underline} acrylonitrile butadiene styrene
([ABS]{.underline}) emissions generated during 3D printing by examining
human lung cells and rats exposed via inhalation. It revealed that the
emitted particles cause moderate toxicity in human lung cells and
minimal toxicity in rats. It's also worth noting that while much of this
research presented today is still early stages, it does add to the
growing evidence of the potential toxicity of 3D printers. For example,
research published last year found that both ABS and polylactic acid
(PLA) particles negatively impacted cell viability, with the latter
prompting a more toxic response. \"The toxicity tests showed that PLA
particles were more toxic than the ABS particles on a per-particle
comparison, but because the printers emitted so much more of the ABS ---
it\'s the ABS emissions that end up being more of the concern,\" said
Rodney Weber, a professor in Georgia Tech\'s School of Earth &
Atmospheric Sciences, who led the research. \"Taken together, these
tests indicate that exposure to these filament particles could over time
be as toxic as the air in an urban environment polluted with vehicular
or other emissions.\" The study also found that the hotter [the
temperature required to melt the filament, the more emissions were
produced and ABS particles emitted from the 3D printers had chemical
characteristics that were different than the ABS filament]{.underline}.
\"When the filament companies manufacture a certain type of filament,
they may add small mass percentages of other compounds to achieve
certain characteristics, but they mostly do not disclose what those
additives are,\" Weber said. \"Because these additives seem to affect
the amount of emissions for ABS, and there can be great variability in
the type and amount of additives added to ABS, a consumer may buy a
certain ABS filament, and it could produce far more emissions than one
from a different vendor.\" [This is important especially as 3D printers
become more commonplace in homes, schools and other places where people
spend a significant amount of time]{.underline}. \"To date, [the general
public has little awareness of possible exposures to 3D printer
emissions]{.underline},\" said Peter Byrley, one of the lead authors of
the EPA studies, in a statement. \"A potential societal benefit of this
research is to increase public awareness of 3D printer emissions, and of
the possibly higher susceptibility of children.\" [And 3D printing might
not just be harmful to humans]{.underline}, another study conducted by
Joana Marie Sipe from Duke University, found that the [bi-products from
the plastics made by the printer can also be damaging to the
environment.]{.underline} For the study, Sipe developed a machine that
can measure how much a plastic product, like a water bottle, can break
down through rubbing and sanding during use and in the environment. The
plastic particles were then fed to fish to see the effects that the
nanoparticles in the plastic had on their organs. What she found was
that when the plastics breakdown, the nanomaterials that were
incorporated become exposed to the environment. The researchers were
able to predict the percentage of nanoparticles that came out of the
plastic when they were eaten by the fish, providing a Matrix Release
Factor (MRF) which could be used to find out the quantity of plastic and
nanoparticles that are released when someone chews a product or when it
breaks down in the ocean. \"This research can help set regulations on
how much nanomaterial fillers can be added to particular consumer
products, based on their MRF value,\" said Sipe in a statement. \"The
data can help determine how much plastic and/or nano-filled products
release contaminants into the environment or the human body.\" So while
3D printing makes numerous products more readily available, and at
cheaper costs, as we've seen with the manufacturing of Covid-19 face
shields, respirators and other personal protective equipment, it's
important to consider the potential risks. And as 3D printing
technologies become more widespread, regulators, manufacturers, and
users may need to focus their attention on better managing those risks.
For example, some measures that can be taken by operators of 3D printers
to lessen their impact on air quality include: Operating 3D printers
only in well-ventilated areas Setting the nozzle temperature at the
lower end of the suggested temperature range for filament materials
Standing away from operating machines Using machines and filaments that
have been tested and verified to have low emissions.

Compensation, Division of Safety and Hygiene, in Columbus, American
Libraries, "The Health Effects of 3D Printing,"
https://americanlibrariesmagazine.org/2016/10/11/the-health-effects-of-3d-printing///ZW\]

As makerspaces and fab labs increase in popularity, more and more
libraries are adding 3D-printing capabilities. According to a 2015
American Library Association (ALA) report, 428 public library branches
have made this technology available. [Some potential issues of 3D
printing]{.underline}, such as the threat of printing weapons and
copyrighted works, [are often considered]{.underline}. [However,
discussion of the health hazards associated with 3D printing is
rare]{.underline}. [Ultrafine particles and volatile organic compounds
Several studies have shown that 3D printers produce high amounts of
ultrafine particles]{.underline} (UFPs) [and volatile organic compounds
(]{.underline}VOCs) while in use, and that these particles and vapors
are detectable for many hours after the printers have been shut off.
[UFPs have been linked to adverse health conditions]{.underline}, such
as asthma and cardiovascular issues, because they can pass through the
lungs and travel to other organs. [They can also transfer toxic material
into the body, including blood and tissue cells]{.underline}. [The US
E]{.underline}nvironmental [P]{.underline}rotection
[A]{.underline}dministration has [classified many VOCs as toxic air
pollutant]{.underline}s. [Exposure]{.underline} to certain VOCs, such as
benzene and methylene chloride, [has been linked to cancer]{.underline}.
UFPs and VOCs are produced by thermal decomposition when a 3D printer
heats and melts a plastic filament. The most popular filaments used in
3D printing are acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) and
polylactic-acid (PLA) filaments. Brent Stephens conducted one of the
first studies on desktop 3D printer UFP and VOC emissions in 2013 in the
journal *[Atmospheric Environment]{.underline}*. Since then, several
other studies have tested 3D printers, using both ABS and PLA filaments.
Most of the studies were conducted with low-cost 3D desktop printers,
the kind that libraries are most likely to purchase. The studies
concluded: [3D printing raises the levels of UFPs dramatically in the
printer's area of operation]{.underline}. [Low-cost]{.underline} desktop
[3D printers]{.underline} and filaments may [produce higher amounts of
UFPs and VOCs]{.underline} than more expensive brands. ABS filaments
produce more particle emissions than PLA filaments. [Even with an
enclosure, nonventilated 3D printers only see a small reduction in UFP
emissions]{.underline}. The carcinogen styrene is produced by ABS
filament heating. [The hazardous chemical methyl methacrylate is
produced by PLA filament heat]{.underline}ing. As a 3D printer ages it
produces higher emissions of UFPs and VOCs. All of the studies concluded
that 3D printers should be placed in well-ventilated areas to limit
exposure to UFPs and VOCs. Some 3D printers have built-in ventilation
systems; libraries should purchase these over nonventilated, less
expensive versions. [ABS and PLA food safety The main food safety
concern with 3D printers is bacterial growth due to small fissures in
printed objects]{.underline}. Items made by [3D printers are
porous]{.underline}, allowing bacteria to grow over time and to
potentially become a health hazard. Also, [children playing with
3D-printed objects run the risk of coming into contact with
bacteria]{.underline} growing on the object after it has become soiled.
Cleaning the object might prove difficult because high dishwasher
temperatures can melt or warp the item (especially with PLA-printed
objects). Some filaments (other than ABS and PLA) are food safe,
including polyethylene terephthalate (PET), which has been FDA approved
for direct food contact. [ABS-created plates, cups, and utensils can
transfer dangerous chemical residues]{.underline}, including
1,3-butadiene, a probable human carcinogen that can cause irritation to
skin and mucous membranes through contact with food. Also, [UFPs and
other residues from the 3D printing process could still be on the
printed material]{.underline}. These levels are small but should still
be of concern to those using 3D-printed material as dinnerware. As new
studies are conducted, we will continue to learn more about the hazards
of using this technology, as well as the ways we can protect ourselves
and our patrons from short- or long-term health effects. Until
additional data is available, library staffers should do the following
to reduce their exposure to UFPs and VOCs: Use 3D printers with either
built-in ventilation or in well-ventilated areas. Keep patrons from
up-close monitoring of printing activity for long periods. Carefully
consider the risks associated with the type of plastic filament used in
devices. Restrict patrons' printing of items that could be used around
food, such as utensils and plates. Follow manufacturer's instructions.
Libraries or any public space providing or considering 3D-printing
services should evaluate their space and printing policies to ensure
this technology is used as safely as possible. Free safety consulting
programs are available through many state workers' compensation systems.

### 3D Printing Regs Bad\-\--1NC

#### 3D printing solves the housing crisis.

Jacob **Bruggeman** 03-22-20**19** \[Writing for Real Clear Politics,
Real Clear Politics, "How 3D Printing Could Fix the Housing Crisis,"
https://www.realclearpolicy.com/articles/2019/03/22/how_3d_printing_could_fix_the_housing_crisis_111134.html//ZW\]

[A growing number of people have no home to call their own]{.underline}.
[As home prices rise]{.underline} in cities from coast to coast --- in
massive metros like Los Angeles to New York and once-affordable cities
in the Midwest like Boise and Grand Rapids --- [young couples are
downsizing the American dream]{.underline}. Among advocates and
policymakers[, there's a growing consensus that housing ought to come
first in the fight to end homelessness]{.underline}, [but America's
stock of affordable housing is dwindling]{.underline}, and many homeless
people are left aging and catching "Medieval diseases" on our city
streets. [It might seem surprising, but technologies like 3D-printing
could be a solution]{.underline} ---keeping Americans off city streets,
and solving the affordable housing crisis. **[But government regulations
are getting in the way]{.underline}**. Right now, [there]{.underline}
simply [isn't enough affordable housing in America]{.underline} for
those demanding it. A recently released a report from the nonprofit Up
For Growth on housing underproduction found that, [between 2000 and
2015, the U.S. produced 7.3 million fewer homes than it needed to keep
up with population growth]{.underline} and consumer demand. In 2015, the
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development reported that there
were only 62 affordable rental homes for every 100 "very low-income"
households, and a meager 38 affordable homes for every 100 households
with "extremely low incomes." Whether you need an affordable home or
rental, there's a shortage in the supply. [3D-printing has the potential
to meet the demand]{.underline}. One company, ICON, is using
trailblazing 3D printing technology to provide cost-effective,
beautiful, and safe homes --- homes that cost under \$10,000 and can be
constructed in under 24 hours. The ICON model showcased at the 2018
South By Southwest festival is 650 square feet and consists of a living
room, kitchen, bedroom, bathroom, and shaded porch that combine to offer
consumers chic digs. And, at 650 square feet, these houses reduce
Americans' carbon footprints. [ICON is one of many companies attempting
to deploy 3D-printing in solving the affordable housing crisis and
fighting homelessness]{.underline}. [Yet these companies confront a
persistent and pernicious obstacle in zoning laws]{.underline}. In
Austin, Texas, housing industry expert Eldon Rude noted the challenge
ICON faces in "obtaining the necessary zoning and entitlements to build
these \[3D-printed\] homes." S-Squared 3D Printers in Patchogue, New
York, weren't even able "to test-print an entire home due to zoning and
building requirements in the village." [While American policymakers and
zoning administrators quibble about whether or not 3D-printed 650 square
foot homes should be allowed in their communities, the United Arab
Emirates (UAE) is planning a 3D-printed skyscraper. Countries like the
UAE will happily take the lead in developing this technology if America
does not.]{.underline} To be clear, [regulation]{.underline} of some
kind is obviously necessary, but it [must be reduced and
simplified]{.underline}. For example, scholars at libertarian think tank
the Mercatus Center argue that [a key to economic revival]{.underline}
in Scranton, Pennsylvania, [is]{.underline} a citywide policy of
"[permissionless innovation]{.underline}," or [a regulatory openness to
novel business models and technologies]{.underline}. Communities both
large and small should reassess their zoning rules, land-use
regulations, and permitting requirements with the aim of encouraging
innovative construction methods and housing ventures rather barring
them. [3D printing has the potential to increase the number of
affordable houses in America, and quickly, too]{.underline}. [Permitting
businesses to experiment]{.underline} with new, affordable construction
methods and housing ventures [will result in more affordable homes and
more housed Americans]{.underline}. This is not the kind of grand plan
we are prone to seek in politics, but it is a strong step toward
increasing Americans' access to affordable housing. If Americans are
serious about curbing the affordable housing crisis, they should lobby
their local governments to simplify and revise their zoning laws to
allow for 3D-printing in construction. The millions of Americans looking
for affordable, dignified homes cannot wait any longer.

#### The housing sector is key to the economy.

Min **Zhu** 06-05-20**14** \[Deputy managing director at IMF,
International Monetary Fund, "Housing Markets, Financial Stability, and
the Economy,"
https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2015/09/28/04/53/sp060514//ZW\]

1\. Let me begin by thanking the Bundesbank and the German Research
Foundation for organizing this conference with us. 2. I will make three
points in my remarks: First, [housing is an essential sector of the
economy]{.underline} **but also one that has been the source of
vulnerabilities and crises.** Hence, [while the recent recovery in
global housing markets is a welcome development, we need to guard
against another unsustainable boom]{.underline}. Second, **detecting
over-valuation in housing markets is still more of an art than a
science.** Broad measures, such as house price to rent ratios, provide a
first pass. But detailed analysis and judgment are needed to make a call
about overvaluation. Third, **the policy toolkit to manage housing booms
is still under construction**. A variety of tools have been used and the
evidence suggests some short-run success. But more analysis and sharing
of experience are needed on what works and what doesn't. Conferences of
this kind are useful in adding to our stock of knowledge. **Role of the
housing sector** 3. Let me elaborate on these three points, beginning
with the role of the housing sector. Food, clothing, shelter: these are
traditionally thought of as basic needs of mankind; so [the housing
sector satisfies an essential need]{.underline}. [Housing is also of
course an important component of investment]{.underline}. And in many
countries [housing makes up the largest component of
wealth]{.underline}. For instance, in the United States, real estate
account for roughly a third of the total assets held by the nonfinancial
private sector. The majority of households tend to hold wealth in the
form of their homes rather than in financial assets: in France, for
example, less than a quarter of households own stocks but nearly 60
percent are homeowners. 4. Housing also plays other key roles; for
instance, [mortgage markets are important in the transmission of
monetary policy]{.underline}. [Adequate housing can]{.underline} also
[facilitate labor mobility within an economy and help economies adjust
to adverse shocks]{.underline}. In short, **[a well-functioning housing
sector is critical to the overall health of the economy]{.underline}**.
[And as economies develop, we expect a corresponding deepening and
growth of housing markets]{.underline}. 5. Despite its importance,
however, [the housing sector has not received adequate attention from
macroeconomists]{.underline}. As Ed Leamer once noted, leading textbooks
in the field often did not have any mention of the housing sector. Of
course, all that has changed since the Great Recession. The bursting of
the real estate bubble in the United States was followed by the deepest
global downturn since the Great Depression. It reminded people of the
collateral damage that can be triggered by housing collapses. 6. Indeed,
[all through history]{.underline}, [housing]{.underline} booms and
[busts have quite often been detrimental to both financial stability and
the real economy]{.underline}. Many major episodes of banking distress
have been associated with boom-bust cycles in property prices. IMF
research shows that of the nearly 50 systemic banking crises in recent
decades, more than two thirds were preceded by boom-bust patterns in
house prices. [The cost of resolving housing crises can be very
high]{.underline}---in the case of Ireland, for instance, government
bailouts of banks from the housing collapse ate up 40 percent of the
country's GDP. In contrast to housing cycles, boom-bust cycles in stock
prices are much less likely to trigger systemic banking crises. 7. [Even
when housing busts do not have a large financial stability impact, they
can affect the real economy]{.underline}. Research shows that
[recessions in OECD countries are more likely given a house price
bust]{.underline}. [Such recessions also tend to be much deeper and
generate more unemployment than normal recessions]{.underline}. In
short, [there is abundant evidence that housing cycles can be a threat
to financial and macroeconomic stability]{.underline}. Hence it is
crucial to keep an eye on current housing market developments to keep
them from going through another boom-bust cycle. **Detecting
overvaluation in housing markets** 8. So where do housing markets stand
today? House prices and residential investment declined in many
countries at the onset of the Great Recession. Since then, there has
been a rebound. Overall, house prices are inching up again: the IMF's
Global House Price Index has increased for the last seven quarters in a
row. Over the past year, 33 out of 51 countries in our index showed
increases in house prices. In some cases house prices are recovering
from a sharp correction during the Great Recession. In other cases,
house prices have continued an upward march with only a bit of
moderation during the Great Recession. 9. Have these developments moved
house prices closer to or further away from economic fundamentals? One
common first pass attempt to answer this question is by looking at
long-run valuation ratios. Theory asserts that house prices, rents, and
incomes should move in tandem over the long run. If house prices and
rents get way out of line, people would switch between buying and
renting, eventually bringing the two in alignment. Similarly, in the
long run, the price of houses cannot stray too far from people's ability
to afford them----that is, from their income. The ratios of house prices
to rents and incomes can thus provide an initial check on whether house
prices are out of line with economic fundamentals. 10. What does the
evidence show? Among the OECD countries, these ratios remain well above
the historical averages for a majority of countries. This is true for
instance for Australia, Belgium, Canada, Norway and Sweden. This
evidence provides a broad indication of housing market valuation. But
one cannot assess overvaluation from this evidence alone. Whereas the
long-run relationships do generally act as an anchor, house prices often
drift away from them strongly and for long periods. Demand momentum
leads to increases in house prices, particularly in situations where the
supply of housing cannot be adjusted quickly due to geographical or
other constraints. Judgments about housing valuation thus require
supplementary information, such as credit growth, household
indebtedness, lender characteristics, and the method of financing. 11.
Of all these potential indicators of the risk of a boom-bust cycle, IMF
research suggests it is particularly important to monitor credit growth.
We find that there is a distinguishing feature of real estate booms that
go 'bad': this feature is the coincidence between the housing boom and
the rapid increase in leverage and exposure of households and financial
intermediaries. During the global financial crisis, nearly all the
countries with "twin booms" in real estate and credit markets---21 out
of 23 countries that we analyzed---ended up suffering from either a
financial crisis or a severe drop in GDP growth relative to the
country's pre-crisis performance. In contrast, of the seven countries
that experienced a real estate boom but not a credit boom, only two went
through a systemic crisis and these countries, on average, had
relatively mild recessions. 12. IMF staff are thus increasingly paying
attention to credit growth, along with several other country-specific
features of the housing market. In recent months, IMF staff have
provided detailed judgments about housing markets for Australia, Israel
and Canada, which are all countries where the broad measures of
valuation are high. We have also provided assessments for many emerging
market economies in Asia and Latin America, where mortgage credit and
house price growth remain strong, and house prices in metropolitan areas
show signs of overheating. In some cases, this more detailed look
suggests much more modest overvaluation than indicated by the house
price to income and house price to rent ratios. One example of this is
Belgium, where the IMF concluded that despite the high valuation ratios,
risks of a sharp correction of real estate prices appear contained.
These country-specific factors for housing cycles suggest that the
policy response cannot be 'one size fits all'. **Constructing a policy
toolkit** 13. With that, let me move to the third---and last---part of
my remarks: the role of policies to contain housing booms. At the
outset, let me note that this is part of a broader discussion of the
appropriate role for monetary policy in the 'new normal'. While many
aspects of this role remain under active discussion, on thing is clear:
monetary policy will have to be more concerned than it was before with
financial stability and hence with housing markets. The era of 'benign
neglect' of house price booms is over. 14. That said, regulation of the
housing sector involves a complex set of policies. The noted economist
Avinash Dixit suggested we use the acronyms "MiP, MaP, MoP" to remind
ourselves of the set of policies. 'MiP' stands for microprudential
policies, which of course aim to ensure the resilience of individual
financial institutions. Such policies are necessary for a sound
financial system but may not be sufficient. Sometimes, actions suitable
at the level of individual institutions can destabilize the system as a
whole. Hence we also need not just 'MiP' but 'MaP', that is,
macroprudential policies aimed at increasing the resilience of the
system as a whole. 15. The main macroprudential tools that have been
used to contain housing booms are limits on loan-to-value (LTV) ratios
and debt-to-income (DTI) ratios and sectoral capital requirements.
Limits on LTV ratios cap the size of a mortgage loan relative to the
value of a property, in essence imposing a minimum down payment. Limits
on DTI ratios restrict the size of a mortgage loan to a fixed multiple
of household income. The hope is to thereby contain unaffordable
increases in household debt. Such limits have long been in use in some
economies. For example, Hong Kong SAR has operated an LTV cap since the
early 1990s and introduced a DTI cap in 1994. In Korea, LTV limits were
introduced in 2002 and DTI limits in 2005. During and after the global
financial crisis, over 20 advanced and emerging economies all over the
globe have followed the example of Hong Kong SAR and Korea. 16. Evidence
thus far suggests that these measures are somewhat effective in cooling
off both house prices and credit growth in the short run. They are able
to break the financial accelerator mechanism that otherwise leads to a
positive two-way feedback between credit booms and housing booms. But
more fine tuning of these measures is needed. Macroprudential measures
need to take into account the ability of market participants to
circumvent some of the limits on leverage. In some countries, such as in
Canada, LTV limits usefully distinguish between owner-occupied vs.
investor mortgages. 17. Another macroprudential tool is to impose
stricter capital requirements on loans to a specific sector such as real
estate. This forces banks to hold more capital against these loans,
discouraging heavy exposure to the sector. In many advanced economies
such as Ireland and Norway, capital adequacy risk weights were increased
on mortgage loans with high LTV ratios. Sectoral capital requirements
have also been used in a number of emerging markets such as Estonia,
Peru, and Thailand. Evidence suggests that while this tool increases
resilience from additional buffers, its ability to curb credit growth is
mixed. Some IMF work suggests that higher capital requirements on
particular groups of mortgage loans have some success in curbing house
price growth in countries like Bulgaria, Croatia, Estonia, and Ukraine.
18. There are a number of reasons why higher capital requirements may be
less effective in containing credit growth. First, when banks hold
capital well above the regulatory minimum, lenders may not need to make
any change in response to increases in risk weights. This often happens
during housing booms when policymakers hope the tool to be most
effective. Second, when lenders compete intensely for market share, they
may internalize the costs of higher capital requirements rather than
impose higher lending rates. 19. Macroprudential tools may also not be
effective to target housing booms that are driven by the shortage of
housing or by increased housing demand from foreign cash inflows that
bypass domestic credit intermediation. In such cases, other tools are
needed. For instance, stamp duty has been imposed to cool down rising
house prices in Hong Kong SAR and Singapore. Evidence shows that this
fiscal tool did reduce demand from foreigners who were outside of the
LTV and DTI regulatory perimeters. In other instances, high house prices
could reflect supply bottlenecks, and hence the effectiveness of
demand-focused instruments may be limited. In such cases, the mismatches
should be fundamentally addressed by measures to increase the supply of
housing. 20. Along with micro and macroprudential policies, we need
'MoP': monetary policy. It is often said using policy interest rates is
a blunt tool for containing house price booms. But as I noted earlier,
housing booms have often coincided with a generalized private credit
boom. This suggests that monetary policy could be an important tool in
many cases in support of macroprudential policies. It is true, however,
that in many relevant cases at the moment, policy interest rates have to
remain low to support economic recovery. **Conclusion** 21. Let me
conclude. Housing booms have different characteristics across countries
and time periods. What is common is that [when the bust comes, it very
often damages financial stability and the real economy]{.underline}. The
tools for containing housing booms are still being developed. The
evidence on their effectiveness is only just starting to accumulate. The
interactions of various policy tools can be complex. **But all this
should not be an excuse for inaction.** The interlocking use of multiple
tools might overcome the shortcomings of any single policy tool. We need
to move from "benign neglect" to an "all of the above" approach when it
comes to policy choices. 22. It is only by maintaining an open dialogue
on these issues that we will gain a solid understanding of how policies
can contain housing booms. International coordination is also essential,
since housing booms in one country can be fed by credit market
developments abroad. The IMF intends to do its part. As I mentioned,
assessments of housing markets are becoming a regular feature of our
country reports. We also report on housing markets through our flagship
publications, the World Economic Outlook and the Global Financial
Stability Report, as well as through other reports to our Executive
Board. We are working with other agencies to improve housing statistics.
**Next week, we are launching a new webpage where all this work will be
given a home.** I encourage you to visit the new Global House Watch page
on imf.org over the coming weeks and see what we have to offer and to
tell us how to do better. 23. The IMF is also contributing to the
sharing of cross-country experiences through regular consultations with
policymakers and experts. We held a successful conference last November,
co-organized with the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, on housing issues.
And I have no doubt that this conference will be just as successful.
Thank you.

#### Government regulation is a roadblock to the industry.

**Harvard Business School** 11-13-20**18** \["Does a 3D Printing Startup
Have a Solution to the Affordable Housing Epidemic,"
https://digital.hbs.edu/platform-rctom/submission/does-a-3-d-printing-startup-have-a-solution-to-the-affordable-housing-epidemic/#//ZW\]

[Does additive manufacturing have the potential to resolve the
affordable housing epidemic in our country]{.underline}? Dr. Berok
Khoshnevis from the University of Southern California and founder of
Contour Crafting ("Contour") certainly believes so. He is currently
working on completing a robot that uses additive manufacturing to create
structures with applications ranging from housing construction to space
colonialization. [Additive manufacturing, commonly referred to as 3-D
printing]{.underline}, is the process of creating 3-D items using
digital code and this advance in manufacturing is emerging as a
megatrend affecting industries from fashion to medicine. However,
[instead of printing plastic objects, Contour plans to print buildings
with a computer-controlled robot that creates hollow walls and then
fills them with concrete until the structure on the code is
complete]{.underline}. Critics argue that 3-D printing will only serve a
niche market within the construction industry allowing for new
architectural experimentation, but Contour believes differently as it
seeks to harness the technology to drive social change.\[i\] Contour
Crafting is focused on [using 3-D printing to transform the construction
industry by reducing costs, saving time and increasing
accessibility]{.underline}. Some of the key cost components of a
development project include raw materials, financing expenses and labor
costs, and Contour's [3-D printing approach]{.underline} proclaims to be
[more cost efficient compared to traditional construction by achieving
cost savings in each category]{.underline}. The [3-D printing approach
eliminates waste of raw materials]{.underline} because each raw material
is close to 100% utilization due to the precision from the computer
enabled machine. By comparison, traditional construction creates over
\$30 billion in wasted raw materials annually since resources are not
utilized as efficiently.\[ii\] 3-D printing can also shorten the project
length from months to one day and thus reduces the required financing
costs needed to fund the project as well as the opportunity cost of
pursuing the project. Finally, 3-D printing reduces the amount of
physical labor needed to complete a project and instead requires more
"intellectual" labor to supervise the machine and construction progress.
As a result of these cost savings, Contour believes it can construct a
house for \$50 per square foot compared to \$150 per square foot for
traditional construction in a fraction of the time.\[iii\] \[iv\]
Contour believes this potential breakthrough technology could impact the
industry not only by reducing costs and project durations, but also by
altering consumer behavior and transforming the industry into a
do-it-yourself (DIY) consumer market for development. In theory, this
[technology could radically improve the accessibility of home
development]{.underline} by allowing people to rent the equipment in
order to print their own homes in a day. In addition, [the technology
could be applied to address the affordable housing epidemic]{.underline}
in our country where millions of low-income citizens are spending 70% or
more of their income on shelter and new housing construction caters to
more affluent citizens.\[v\] Contour's technology could also print homes
quickly as part of natural disaster recovery plans following
earthquakes, wildfires or hurricanes and the US Department of Defense
recently awarded Contour with a Rapid Innovation Fund contract to fund
research supporting these technology applications.\[vi\] In the short
term, the company needs to focus on R&D and the development of a working
prototype that can demonstrate the building process, all of the
proclaimed efficiencies and ultimately complete a home that people would
be willing to inhabit. In the medium term, Contour will need to identify
its main target market since the target customer will influence the
product development iterations. For example, Contour could develop the
printers and license them to housing developers, market them directly to
consumers and establish a DIY market or it could print houses itself and
collaborate with the government to provide housing in areas most in
need. Each strategy would impact the development of the product because
each potential user could have varying needs from the level of
customization of the project to the scale of the potential construction
project. In addition, [there would be different regulatory hurdles
associated with each path since the construction industry is burdened
with regulation from zoning requirements to permits]{.underline}.
Finally, Contour needs to emphasize quality control when designing these
homes if its long-term goal is to provide a solution for unaffordable
housing. Without top quality, there will be a distrust of this product
and it would be difficult to garner support of these printed homes from
the government and the public as a viable solution to unaffordable
housing. Some additional questions to consider include: Can construction
ever truly become a consumer DIY market? How should Contour Crafting
think about employment in the construction industry and the negative
consequences of job displacement from this new technology? Who should be
part of the decision-making process if this technology is used to solve
affordable housing shortages and what is the best approach for designing
that process?

#### Regulation is the biggest issue in the market.

Jarett **Gross** 03-29-20**20** \[Construction tech correspondent,
Automate Construction, "Regulation and Permitting for 3D Printing,"
https://automate.construction/2020/03/29/regulation-and-permitting-for-3d-printed-construction///ZW\]

**[The biggest issue with the 3-D printed construction market right now
is regulation]{.underline}**. Enormous unions that are stuck in old ways
have had influence over construction standards and regulations in
America over the past two decades. [There has yet to be a legally
permitted residence 3-D printed in America]{.underline}. However there
are [other countries with fewer regulatory hurdles that have already 3-D
printed structures completed with people living in them
currently]{.underline}. Most notably a project done by Icon Build and
New Story in Ecuador. These strict regulations could take decades to
change, that is why the cost of the specialized concrete needs to go
down so that the technology can be a significant enough improvement to
convince legal officials to permit 3-D printed construction. If all goes
well it could be a matter of a few years until it is evident these
structures are strong and safe enough to allow humans to live in
them.The best markets for 3-D printing construction are southern areas
where the temperature rarely goes below freezing. If the temperature
rarely goes below freezing then it is not necessary to pour extremely
deep concrete or drill down to the bedrock in order to have a
structurally secure building. If the leaders of your municipalities in
states like Texas or Florida want to champion this technology there is
certainly that opportunity. [It is likely that the first region to adapt
this technology wilI have an economic boom]{.underline} with the
quantity of high-quality unique affordable housing that this technology
has to offer. In some countries in Europe, plans are already underway to
build complete 3-D printed villages. These towns are a very exciting
opportunity for this technology to demonstrate its practicality.The
people who need this technology most are people in impoverished
countries. Unfortunately those countries are often the last to receive
the benefits of new innovations. It is challenging to do even nonprofit
projects in these regions because often times the government officials
or imposters are so corrupt that they expect to be paid to allow you to
do charity work uplifting their communities. If not the government,
there are often rogue rebel groups that will cause issues and delay if
not stop completely your progress and mission. Without a seasoned
overseas non-profit veteran on the team it is a dangerous and
treacherous and environment to pursue. In my opinion the best way to
make this technology mainstream is for the current companies that have
built printers to focus on printing things that don't require
complicated permits. Many products come to thought, you could build a
fireplace, a bench, a fountain or other water feature, a planter wall, a
retaining wall, highway barriers, a shed, an outdoor standalone garage,
the list goes on and on. [If companies can produce these products to be
attractive to consumers from both a quality and cost standpoint then it
could be the optimal way to introduce the public to this technology of
the future and get them comfortable with it]{.underline} so that when
the time comes that these robots are building their new home they feel
safe and excited to moving.As this technology improves new ideas
constantly come along for applications that drastically improve the
efficiency compared to traditional construction methods.

Greater tax generation, creation of jobs, opportunities for economic
development, increased job retention and productivity, and the ability
to address inequality --- all are among the economic benefits of
increased access to quality, affordable housing. [A]{.underline} 2004
[report showed a harmful link between high housing costs and employee
recruitment, productivity and retention, which hurts businesses and a
community's economy]{.underline}. Since then, [the impact of high
housing costs in the U.S., both rental and homeownership, has only
grown]{.underline}. [Freeing our local, state and national economies
from the drag created when housing is unaffordable helps
everyone]{.underline}. Hear more from these economists, housing experts
and public officials about just some of the economic impacts of housing.
Economic development "Pittsfield is a post-industrial New England city
of 45,000 people that is rebuilding after a long period of economic
decline. We were a one-company town that has had to work on building a
diverse economy. We can see how not investing in several of our
neighborhoods with concentrated poverty is diminishing the value of the
housing. We now need to turn our attention to rebuilding our
neighborhoods. "I am a firm believer that job creation, business
development and stabilized neighborhoods are all part of economic
development. In my position, I talk to business leaders. I talk to
residents. A common theme that I hear is that we have inadequate housing
for business expansion. If we want to get our arms around solving both
of those problems, then housing is certainly part of the economy. **---
Linda Tyer, mayor of Pittsfield, Massachusetts** Income inequality "[As
the cost of housing goes up in a community, people may not be able to
afford to live there so they move further out]{.underline}. [Moving
further away from hot markets may be stopping people from working in
locations with higher wages]{.underline}. [This impedes the ability of
businesses to hire workers and is not good for]{.underline} local
[economies]{.underline}. "[The higher cost of housing in markets with
higher wages also may be exacerbating income inequality]{.underline}
because less-educated and lower-income households are particularly the
ones likely unable to afford housing in the denser, higher-cost areas.
While local decisions may be key drivers in the higher cost of housing,
the drag on the economy and its contribution to greater income
inequality is playing out on the national stage." **--- Katherine
O'Regan, *New York University Wagner* professor of public policy and
planning** "We as a country always act like we can't find the money to
solve this home affordability crisis, which implies that we are not
spending it now. We are spending it now. We are just spending in on
adverse health and bad outcomes." --- Dr. Megan Sandel Attracting and
keeping business and manufacturing "Home affordability is an economic
issue. Take Indiana, my state, which is one of the top manufacturing
states in the Midwest. "[Manufacturers have been screaming because they
have the factory jobs, but the communities where they do business don't
have enough affordable workforce housing]{.underline} --- homes between
\$100,000 and \$250,000. We have a giant auto plant in Southern Indiana
but [not enough affordable housing to keep up with the demands of the
manufacturer or the vendors that work with them]{.underline}. The
bankers are screaming because they have money to lend families, but
there's not enough housing that the workers can afford. "The Chamber of
Commerce is saying, [housing that is affordable doesn't just help
families --- it helps the local government]{.underline}. When we get
families into homes, they can begin paying property taxes. And if they
have a home that they can afford, they have more expendable funds to
spend on food and other consumer goods. They help local businesses
because they can afford to eat in restaurants and shop in stores." **---
Gina Leckron, *Habitat for Humanity Indiana* state director** Additional
"hidden" costs "We have used some of our research out of Children's
HealthWatch, a research policy network based at Boston Medical Center,
to ask, 'What health care and educational costs could be avoided if all
families with children lived in a stable home?' We estimated that number
at \$111 billion over 10 years. "This is based on the health-related
costs of mothers and children who have either experienced homelessness,
moved two or more times or been behind on rent in the previous year. The
costs linked to unstable housing include increased hospitalizations,
ambulatory visits, dental procedures, mental health care for mothers and
special education services for children. "We as a country always act

at a public meeting held at the county \[9\]. [What are the risks? More
to the point what is 5G]{.underline}? What is 5G? The 5th generation
wireless systems ([5G]{.underline}) [are new network technologies
designed to make your]{.underline} cell phone and similar [wireless
devices become super-duper powerful and fast]{.underline}. Scheduled to
be deployed from 2018 and made commercially available in 2020 \[2\] we
are told 5G is expected to support at least 100 billion devices and up
to 100 times faster than current 4G technology. (4G is already about 10
times faster than 3G). [The 5G tech will employ]{.underline} low-(0.6
GHz - 3.7 GHz), mid-(3.7 -- 24 GHz), and high-band frequencies (24 GHz
and higher). The "[high-band" frequencies largely consist of millimeter
waves (MMWs), a type of electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths
within 1- 10 millimeters and frequencies ranging from 30 to 300
GHz]{.underline}. [Health Hazards]{.underline} from Cell Phone
Technology "[Beyond Measure]{.underline}" [Cell phones
operate]{.underline} essentially [by sending and receiving
radiofrequency radiation]{.underline} from their antennas to a nearby
cell tower. [Thousands of independent studies link Radiofrequency
radiation exposures from cell phones to a number of very serious
diseases]{.underline} such as; [Cancer]{.underline} \[3\],
[Infertility]{.underline} \[4\], [Cardiovascular Diseases]{.underline}
\[5\], [Birth defects]{.underline} \[6\], Memory Problems \[7\], Sleep
Disorders \[7\] [and so on]{.underline}. 5G Technology Comes With
Increased RF Radiation Exposure These millimeter waves
([MMWs]{.underline}) as used by the 5G network [can transmit large
amounts of data within a short period of time]{.underline}. But over
short distances and also, [the]{.underline} other [big issue is that the
signal is poorly transmitted through solid materials]{.underline}. [This
means massive transmission of MMW will be needed]{.underline}. Many new
antennas will be needed. We are told full-scale implementation may
require at least one antenna for every 10 to 12 houses in urban areas.
Also, the [MIMO]{.underline} (multiple-input multiple-output) technology
[is expected to be used massively]{.underline}. The MIMO technology is a
wireless system that uses multiple transmitters hence, it is able to
send and receive multiple/more data at once. Some 4G base stations
already use MIMO technology. Standard MIMO involves four to eight
antennae. MIMO for 5G may involve approximately 100 antennas per cell
tower -- that's a lot of antennas! [Increased transmission leads to
increased capacity]{.underline}, [so electromagnetic radiation levels
can only increase]{.underline}. The concern is that, given what we know
about radio frequency radiation, [this mandatory environmental increase
in exposure to EM radiation will lead to increased health
risks]{.underline}. A number of studies have demonstrated the
detrimental health effects of the MMW frequencies used in 5G technology.
Damaging Effects on the Human Skin [One]{.underline} Israeli
[study]{.underline} \[8\] lead by Dr. Yuri D Feldman [found that human
sweat ducts act as an array of tiny, helix-shaped antennas when exposed
to MMWs]{.underline}. Their findings suggest that [human
skin]{.underline} not only absorbs but also [amplifies the radiation
from MMW networks]{.underline}. A study carried \[9\]out to evaluate the
interactions and implications of MMWs (60GHz) with the human body
discovered [that "more than 90% of the transmitted (MMWs) power is
absorbed in the epidermis and dermis layer]{.underline}." [The effect of
MMWs on the skin is arguably the greatest concern of these new
wavelengths utilized by 5G technology]{.underline}. We might well be
looking at the possibility of increased incidences of many skin diseases
and cancer in the coming years in areas where the 5G technology is
deployed. Profound Effect On Immune System A 2002 Russian study \[10\]
carried out to examine the effects of high-frequency electromagnetic
radiation (42HGz) exposure on the blood of healthy mice found that, [the
activity of cells involved in immunity such as the neutrophils reduced
drastically]{.underline} (about 50% decrease in activity). It was
concluded that "[the whole-body exposure of healthy mice to
low-intensity EHF EMR has a profound effect on the indices of
nonspecific immunity]{.underline}." Damaging Effects on The Heart A 1992
study \[11\]found that frequencies in the range 53-78GHz impacted the
heart rate variability (an indicator of stress) in rats. A Russian study
\[12\]on frogs whose skin was exposed to MMWs discovered abnormal heart
rate changes (arrhythmias). Hazardous Effects on the Eyes In 1994, a
study \[12\]carried out in Poland to evaluate the influence of
millimeter radiation on light transmission through the lens of the eyes.
It was discovered that low-level MMW radiation produced lens opacity in
rats, which is associated the production of cataracts. A Japanese
experiment \[13\]carried out to examine the potential for 60-GHz
millimeter-wave exposure to cause acute ocular injuries found that 60GHz
"...millimeter-wave antennas can cause thermal injuries of varying types
of levels. The thermal effects induced by millimeter waves can
apparently penetrate below the surface of the eye." 180 Scientist and
Doctors Call For A Moratorium [Scientists are concerned as
well]{.underline}. **[More than 180 scientists and doctors from 35
countries]{.underline}** \[14\], have [recommended a]{.underline}
temporary [ban on]{.underline} the roll-out of [5G
technology]{.underline} until its potential hazards on human health and
the environment have been fully evaluated by scientists independent of
the telecommunication industry. What Are The Real Dangers Of 5G
Technology? The short answer is: we don't fully know yet! But the
studies we have on this are a cause for concern. The health hazard of
the most studied 3G CMDA technology (shown to cause an array of
detrimental health effects) have not been fully revealed, yet, here we
are, at the verge of adopting a potentially more dangerous technology.
Don't you think we should fully evaluate the health effects of 5G before
rolling out the technology? Let's not forget, alternatives to wireless
mobile technology are available. Fiber Optic Broadband Technology is a
feasible and safer alternative. I firmly believe that technological
improvement can be attained without jeopardizing the health of the
general public.

knows which technologies will be additionally installed in the
satellites that could be used, for example, for military purposes? And
who owns space anyway? Who decides on it? Up to now, the authorities of
the respective location nation can issue permits. In the case of
Starlink, it is the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in
Washington D.C., USA. The FCC is closely linked to the mobile phone
industry. This American authority therefore grants permits for uses that
affect the whole world. Should not an internationally recognized body,
free of all conflicts of interest, decide on this? In addition to these
more political questions, we should also look at why satellite radiation
could be an unexpectedly big threat to life. [Natural shield under fire
All life is electromagnetic]{.underline}. What may sound strange at
first, is not at all on closer inspection. Isn't the electron the
smallest building block of all life? With its electric charge, it orbits
the atomic nucleus, forms atoms and interacts with other electrons,
atoms and electromagnetic fields. The main component of all life, the
water molecule, is also structured as a dipole and thus has similar
properties as a bar magnet, which aligns in the magnetic field. [At the
cell level, the cell tension or the voltage-controlled calcium-ion
channels in the cell membrane show us the connection to
electromagnetism]{.underline}. The transmission of stimuli in the nerve
pathways, the heartbeat---an electrical impulse that can be made visible
in the cardiogram---or the brain currents that can be recorded with
probes: these are all electromagnetic processes that form the basic
essence of life. It is likely that all chemical and biological reactions
are preceded by electromagnetic processes. Even the blueprint of
biological organisms is determined by electric fields, as the American
professor of anatomy Harrold Saxton Burr was able to demonstrate as
early as the 1940s.^7)^ Find out more in our article "All Life Works
Electrically!"^8)^ On the large scale as on the small: the habitat Earth
and with it all life in general is embedded in a well-balanced, natural
electromagnetic environment. The Earth's magnetic field extends from the
North Pole over the globe to the South Pole, whereas these magnetic
poles can deviate from the geographic poles and even migrate. The Earth
is negatively charged compared to space, which causes a voltage
difference of 400,000 volts between the Earth's surface and the upper
end of the atmosphere.^9)^ Complex processes caused by atmospheric
electricity, thunderstorm activity and charge shifts by air ions or
water molecules are a natural clock for life. The ionosphere begins at
an altitude of about 80 km above the Earth's surface. It is that part of
the atmosphere that contains large amounts of ions and free electrons.
The ionosphere is highly conductive, reaches its highest electron
density at about 300 km and ends at about 1,000 km. A standing
electromagnetic wave, the so-called Schumann resonance, forms between
the Earth's surface and this ionosphere.^10)^ EAccording to the Earth's
circumference as wavelength, the base frequency is 7.8 Hz.
Interestingly, this frequency also coincides with human brain waves at
the seam between alpha and theta states.^11)^ As early as 2001, New
Zealand's environmental scientist Dr. Neil Cherry showed in a
ground-breaking publication^12)^ how ionospheric disorders cause changes
in blood pressure and melatonin levels and, therefore, can lead to
cancer, reproductive disorders, heart and neurological diseases and even
death. On an even larger scale, all celestial bodies, from simple
asteroids to moons, planets, suns, galaxies and universes, are connected
to each other via electromagnetic fields and are in a permanent exchange
of information. What was called aether in the late 17th century and was
discarded in the meantime, is now gaining in importance again. The
airless space between the celestial bodies is by no means empty, but
filled with electromagnetic particles, which are present as vortex
charges and are called neutrinos.^13)^In his book "A beginner's view of
our electric universe", Tom Findlay impressively describes how
[electromagnetism is the basic principle of the whole
universe]{.underline}. Findlay illustrates how plasma physics can be
used to consistently explain the celestial bodies known to this
day---from planets, suns to galaxies, pulsars to black holes. Here, too,
a basic prerequisite is that space is not simply empty, but permeated
with conductive "material", a plasma. In this plasma, gigantic currents
flow between the celestial bodies, thus ensuring an exchange of energy
and information. "Everything is connected with everything"---the saying
acquires a completely new and concrete meaning from this point of view,
in the purely physical sense. But back to Earth. Similar to the cell
membrane, the ionosphere acts as a contact surface to the other
celestial bodies and thus occupies a special position in the "organism
Earth". And it is precisely in this protective sphere, at an altitude of
between 300 and 600 km, [that 100,000 satellites are to be placed, which
will contaminate the ionosphere, atmosphere and the Earth's surface with
sharply pulsed technical radiation]{.underline}. What influence does
satellite radiation have on the ionosphere? Can it maintain its
function? Will this affect the Schumann resonance? Will the
life-sustaining charge differences between Earth and the ionosphere
change? Who can answer these questions conclusively? Weather and climate
[Satellite radiation could also affect our weather and
climate]{.underline}. Water as the main component of life reacts very
sensitively to electromagnetic radiation. Various research and
experiments show not only warming effects, but changes in the water
structure and the forces of order, even at very low radiation
intensities far below the official limits.^14)^ The water molecule
reaches peak energy absorption at 2.4 GHz and is particularly sensitive.
Of all frequencies, this one is used for numerous technical
applications: microwave oven, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi emit exactly at 2.4
GHz. Water vapour in the atmosphere emits a very weak signal in the
range of 23.8 GHz (which corresponds to the first resonance frequency of
water), which is received by weather satellites, evaluated, and used for
weather and climate forecasts. Absurdly, exactly such frequency bands
are also being released for 5G radio services, so that the natural water
vapour radiation is superimposed and can no longer be evaluated
correctly. This is already the case [in the USA]{.underline}, and in
Europe, the use of this frequency band for 5G is already planned for the
future. [Reliable weather or hurricane forecasting will no longer be
possible]{.underline}.^15)^ Meteorologists worldwide are concerned about
this development and demand that frequency bands close to these water
frequencies should not be used technically. But what happens to the
water vapour itself if it is stimulated by technical radiation in the
range of its own resonance frequency? Is the water vapour balance
disturbed in the atmosphere? Is global warming accelerating? [The
atmosphere is not a garbage dump]{.underline} According to estimates by
the European Space Agency ESA, about 10,000 satellites have been
launched into near-Earth orbit since the launch of the space age in
1957, of which 3,400 are still active. 22,300 debris objects are already
circling around the Earth! So it is no surprise that ESA director
general Jan Wörner warns of the very great danger posed by these pieces
of debris. [With the planned 100,000 5G satellites, space debris will
increase many times over]{.underline}. Today's solution for satellite
disposal is: to burn them up in the atmosphere, returning them to Earth
(to sink them in the "satellite graveyard" South Pacific) or moving them
into the more distant "graveyard orbit". The Starlink satellites are
designed for a service life between 1 and 5 years (!)^16)^, it will be
similar with the other companies. What a waste of valuable and rare raw
materials such as lithium, cobalt, copper and gold! [At least 20,000
failed satellites will have to be replaced and disposed of each year.
The effects of rocket exhausts and the toxins released on the atmosphere
by burning up space debris have hardly been studied]{.underline}. "Some
particles are very reactive, so small amounts of them could have a
significant impact on atmospheric chemistry," says Martin Ross, one of
the few experts to address the issue of atmospheric pollution from
carrier rocket emissions and the burning up of old satellites. The
scientists Ross and Vedda of the Aerospace Corporation show in their
2018 report that the sensitive stratosphere is so disturbed by the
combustive products of the rockets (gases and particles such as aluminum
and chlorine) that the depletion of the ozone layer is promoted and the
atmospheric radiation balance is changed, which is expressed secondarily
in changing weather conditions.^17)^ Of course, sinking space debris in
the South Pacific is just as stupid. History teaches us that every
corpse in the basement eventually appears and must be properly "disposed
of". So why not make sure from the start that this does not happen in
the first place? [The]{.underline} International Astronomical Union
([IAU]{.underline}) [is concerned about these satellite constellations,
because in addition to atmospheric pollution, light pollution is also a
major problem]{.underline}. Astronomical observations are disturbed by
the thousands of light points at the nocturnal firmament, some of which
are visible to the naked eye, and space loses its original purity. In
order to better understand the universe, the principle of a
radiation-free night sky is essential, be it as a resource for all
humanity or as well for the protection of nocturnal animals.^18)^ From a
philosophical and spiritual point of view, the undisturbed view into the
immeasurable starry sky gives an inkling that life itself must go far
beyond our physical earthly existence. The satellite plans are also in
heavy contrast to the Space Treaty^19)^ , which entered into force in
October 10, 1967 and was ratified by 110 states by July 2020, including
almost all states currently engaged in space activities^20)^ It
stipulates that the use of space should be done in such a way that "its
contamination and any unfavourable change in the earthly environment as
a result of the introduction of extraterrestrial substances is avoided "
(Art. IX). Are Hollywood fantasies becoming a reality? [Supposedly 5G is

Neuralink had succeeded in implanting a brain chip on pigs and
controlling them through their smartphones. In February 2021, it was
additionally announced that monkeys would now enjoy video games thanks
to a brain chip.^25)^ The goal is to "make technology usable for
humans," said Elon Musk, founder of Neuralink, to the US portal
Axios.^26)^ )) Thanks to an interface, man should be able to control
devices through his thoughts alone or to be able to exchange with other
people (and machines) by means of "artificial telepathy". It goes
without saying that this requires powerful, radio-based networks that
cover every angle of the earth. Not only does it open the door to
absolute control and manipulation, but man as an individual is deprived
of his reason for existence and separated from his spiritual core. Is it
not the case that man is destined to constantly learn, gain experience
and develop? However, this is only possible if he has the freedom of
choice and can make decisions independently. Is the presumption that
Starlink and Neuralink go hand in hand with the goal of creating the
"Superman" from whom his humanity is taken away and who thus is
ultimately robbed of the meaning of life?^27)^ Resistance arises In
addition to countless activities, civic movements, initiatives and
appeals at the regional level, there is also resistance on the
international stage. The American Arthur Firstenberg^28)^ launched the
**[International Appeal Stop 5G on Earth and in Space]{.underline}** in
2018, which has been signed by more than 300,000 scientists, doctors,
environmental organizations and citizens from 214 nations by the end of
March 2021.^29)^ It is addressed to the United Nations (UN), the World
Health Organisation (WHO), the European Union (EU), the Council of
Europe and the governments of all countries of the world and calls for
"an immediate halt to the expansion and deployment of the 5G radio
network (fifth generation Internet), including the use of 5G
transmission systems on space satellites \[...\] The harmful effect of
radiofrequency radiation on humans and the environment has been proven.
The use of 5G is an experiment on humanity and the environment, which is
defined as a crime by international law." In order for this call to
finally be heard, everyone can become active: talk to politicians or
your friends and neighbours, write letters, participate in national or
international appeals and engage in the education about these facts and
open questions. Unfortunately, in the general digitisation craze, too
many government representatives and media fail to provide balanced
information on **[all]{.underline}** aspects of 5G. And most
importantly: Be a role model yourself, in everything you say or do. Our
vision for the future As exciting and helpful as technological progress
is in many ways, one thing must NEVER be forgotten: technology is merely
an aid, a tool designed to serve man and the realisation of his life's
mission. On humanity's path of development, we have reached a point
where our actions could have global repercussions, even as far as the
extinction of life and the destruction of the entire planet. The
unbridled pollution and harassment of all life by microwave radiation is
one of these effects. It is therefore high time to explore our reason
for existence and to orient our lives towards fulfilling this reason.
This is not possible in the noise of the uninterrupted temptations and
empty promises of the entertainment and distraction industry or the mass
and "social" media---about which absolutely nothing is social except the
name. This is only possible by listening to the organ which provides the
strongest magnetic force and connects people: Our heart!

[5G leads to massive increase of mandatory exposure to wireless
radiation 5G technology is effective only over short distance. It is
poorly transmitted through solid material]{.underline}. [Many new
antennas will be required and full-scale implementation will result in
antennas every 10 to 12 houses in urban areas, thus massively increasing
mandatory exposure]{.underline}. With "the ever more extensive use of
wireless technologies," [nobody can avoid to be exposed]{.underline}.
Because on top of the increased number of 5G-transmitters (even within
housing, shops and in hospitals) according to estimates, "10 to 20
billion connections" (to refrigerators, washing machines, surveillance
cameras, self-driving cars and buses, etc.) will be parts of the
Internet of Things. [All these together can cause a substantial increase
in the total, long term RF-EMF exposure]{.underline} to all EU citizens.
[Harmful effects of RF-EMF exposure are already proven]{.underline}
[Over 220 scientists from more than 40 countries have expressed their
"serious concerns" regarding the ubiquitous and increasing exposure to
EMF generated by electric and wireless devices]{.underline} already
before the additional 5G roll-out. They refer to the fact that
"[numerous recent scientific publications have shown that EMF affects
living organisms at levels well below most international and national
guidelines]{.underline}". [Effects include increased cancer risk,
cellular stress, increase in harmful free radicals, genetic damages,
structural and functional changes of the reproductive system, learning
and memory deficits, neurological disorders, and negative impacts on
general well-being in humans]{.underline}. Damage goes well beyond the
human race, as [there is growing evidence of harmful effects to both
plants and animals]{.underline}. After the scientists' appeal was
written in 2015 additional research has convincingly confirmed serious
health risks from RF-EMF fields from wireless technology. The world's
largest study (25 million US dollar) National Toxicology Program (NTP),
shows statistically significant increase in the incidence of brain and
heart cancer in animals exposed to EMF below the ICNIRP (International
Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection) guidelines followed by
most countries. These results support results in human epidemiological
studies on RF radiation and brain tumour risk. [A large number of
peer-reviewed scientific reports demonstrate harm to human health from
EMFs]{.underline}. The International Agency for Research on Cancer
(IARC), the cancer agency of the World Health Organization (WHO), in
2011 concluded that EMFs of frequencies 30 KHz -- 300 GHz are possibly
carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B). However, new studies like the NTP
study mentioned above and several epidemiological investigations
including the latest studies on mobile phone use and brain cancer risks
confirm that RF-EMF radiation is carcinogenic to humans. The EUROPA
EM-EMF Guideline 2016 states that "[there is strong evidence that
long-term exposure to certain EMFs is a risk factor for diseases such as
certain cancers, Alzheimer\'s disease, and male
infertility]{.underline}...Common EHS (electromagnetic hypersensitivity)

[[https://www.bbc.com/news/health-40719743//ZW]{.underline}](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-40719743/ZW)\]

[Humans could become extinct if sperm counts in men continue to
fall]{.underline} at current rates, a doctor has warned. [Researchers
assessing the results of nearly 200 studies say sperm counts among
men]{.underline} from North America, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand,
[seem to have halved in less than 40 years]{.underline}. Some experts
are sceptical of the [[Human Reproduction
Update]{.underline}](https://academic.oup.com/DocumentLibrary/humupd/PR/dmx022_final.pdf)
findings. But lead researcher Dr Hagai Levine said he was \"[very
worried]{.underline}\" [about what might happen in the
future]{.underline}. [The assessment, one of the largest ever
undertaken, brings together the results of 185 studies between 1973 and
2011]{.underline}. Dr Levine, an epidemiologist, told the BBC that [if
the trend continued humans would become extinct]{.underline}. Decline
rate \'increasing\' \"[If we will not change the ways that we are
living]{.underline} and the environment and the chemicals that we are
exposed to, [I am very worried about what will happen in the
future]{.underline},\" he said. \"[Eventually we may have a problem, and
with reproduction in general, and **it may be the extinction of the
human species**]{.underline}.\" [Scientists]{.underline} not involved in
the study have [praised the quality of the research]{.underline} but say
that it may be premature to come to such a conclusion. Dr Levine, from
the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, found a 52.4% decline in sperm
concentration, and a 59.3% decline in total sperm count in men from
North America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand. The study also
indicates the rate of decline among men living in these countries is
continuing and possibly even increasing. [Previous research
\'flawed\']{.underline} In contrast, [no significant decline was seen in
South America, Asia and Africa, but]{.underline} the researchers point
out that [far fewer studies have been conducted on these
continents]{.underline}. However, Dr [Levine is concerned that
eventually sperm counts could fall in these places too]{.underline}.
Many previous studies have indicated similar sharp declines in sperm
count in developed economies, but sceptics say that a large proportion
of them have been flawed. Some have investigated a relatively small
number of men, or included only men who attend fertility clinics and
are, in any case, more likely to have low sperm counts. There is also
concern that studies that claim to show a decline in sperm counts are
more likely to get published in scientific journals than those that do
not. Another difficulty is that early methods of counting sperm may have
overestimated the true count. Taken together these factors may have
created a false view of falling sperm counts. But the [researchers claim
to have accounted for]{.underline} some of these
[deficiencies]{.underline}, leaving some doubters, such as Prof Allan
Pacey of Sheffield University, less sceptical. He said: \"I\'ve never
been particularly convinced by the many studies published so far
claiming that human sperm counts have declined in the recent past.\"
\"However, the study today by Dr Levine and his colleagues deals head-on
with many of the deficiencies of previous studies.\" Smoking and obesity
But Prof Pacey believes that although the new study has reduced the
possibility of errors it does not entirely remove them. So, he says, the
results should be treated with caution. \"The debate has not yet been
resolved and there is clearly much work still to be done. \"However, the
paper does represent a step forward in the clarity of the data which
might ultimately allow us to define better studies to examine this
issue.\" There is no clear evidence for the reason for this apparent
decrease. But it has been linked with exposure to chemicals used in
pesticides and plastics, obesity, smoking, stress,
[[diet]{.underline}](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-17353804), and
even [[watching too much
TV]{.underline}](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-21326810). Dr Levine
says that there is an urgent need to find out why sperm counts are
decreasing and to find ways of reversing the trend. \"We must take
action - for example, better regulation of man-made chemicals - and we
must continue our efforts on tackling smoking and obesity.\"

### AT: 4G Thumps\-\--2NC

[5G is qualitatively and quantitatively different from 4G The idea that
we will tolerate tens to hundreds of times more radiation at millimetre
wavelengths is based on faulty modelling of the human body]{.underline}
as a shell filled with a homogeneous liquid. [The assumption that
millimetre waves do not penetrate beyond the skin completely ignores
nerves, blood vessels and other electrically conducting structures that
can carry radiation-induced currents deep into the body]{.underline}.
Another, potentially more serious error is that [phased arrays are not
ordinary antennas]{.underline}. When an ordinary electromagnetic field
enters the body, it causes charges to move and currents to flow. But
[when extremely short electromagnetic pulses enter the body, something
else happens]{.underline}: [the moving charges themselves become little
antennas that reradiate the electromagnetic field and send it deeper
into the body.]{.underline} These reradiated waves are called Brillouin
precursors. They become significant when either the power or the phase
of the waves changes rapidly enough. [5G will]{.underline} probably
[satisfy both criteria]{.underline}. In addition, [shallow penetration
in itself poses a unique danger to eyes and]{.underline} to the largest
organ of the body, the [skin]{.underline}, [as well as to very small
creatures]{.underline}. Peer-reviewed studies have recently been
published, predicting thermal skin burns in humans from 5G radiation and
resonant absorption by insects, which absorb up to 100 times as much
radiation at millimetre wavelengths as they do at wavelengths presently
in use. Since populations of flying insects have declined by 75-80 per
cent since 1989 even in protected nature areas, [5G radiation could have
catastrophic effects on insect populations worldwide]{.underline}. A
1986 study by Om Gandhi warned that millimetre waves are strongly
absorbed by the cornea of the eye, and that ordinary clothing, being of
millimetre-size thickness, increases the absorption of energy by the
skin by a resonance-type effect. Russell (2018) reviews the known
effects of millimetre waves on skin, eyes (including cataracts), heart
rate, immune system and DNA.

[and the adverse health and environmental impacts were not

**Conclusion** So [what is Arthur Firstenberg's chilling
conclusion]{.underline}? '[You cannot contaminate the global electrical
circuit with millions of pulsed, modulated electronic signals without
destroying all of life]{.underline}.' But, as outlined above, since
'controlling' electricity in 1746, [humans have been increasingly
contaminating the global electrical circuit and it has culminated in
what will now be the final electromagnetic assault on
Earth]{.underline}. Which means that **[unless we can halt the launch of
these 5G satellites and the rollout of the technology 'on the ground' we
will be 'destroying all of life']{.underline}**. And while some groups
advocate measures to protect ourselves as individuals, inadequate though
these must be in the unfolding circumstances, [no amount of measures to
individually protect ourselves from this electromagnetic radiation will
protect 'all of life' in the wild.]{.underline} According to Ross Adey,
the grandfather of bioelectromagnetics and atmospheric physicist Neil
Cherry, [we are electrically tuned to the world around us and 'the safe
level of exposure to radio waves is zero]{.underline}'. There is
virtually no time left to understand and act powerfully on that
knowledge. What will you do?

while the local risks of civil drones are attracting attention
(Velicovich 2017).

It seems likely that [future viruses will be]{.underline} **[more
sophisticated]{.underline}** than contemporary ones [and will have some
elements of AI]{.underline}. [This could include the ability to **model
the outside world**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[adapt]{.underline}** [its behavior to the world]{.underline}. Narrow
AI viruses will probably be able to use human language to some extent,
and [may use it for **phishing attacks**]{.underline}. Their abilities
may be rather primitive compared with those of artificial general
intelligence (AGI), but they could be sufficient to trick users via
chatbots and to adapt a virus to multiple types of hardware. The threat
posed by this type of narrow AI becomes greater if the creation of
superintelligent AI is delayed and potentially dangerous hardware is
widespread.

[A narrow AI virus could become a]{.underline} **[global catastrophic
risk]{.underline}** (GCR) [if the types of hardware it affects are
spread]{.underline} **[across the globe]{.underline}**, [or if the
affected hardware can act globally]{.underline}. The risks depend on the
number of hardware systems and their power. For example, [if a virus
affected]{.underline} **[nuclear weapon control systems]{.underline}**,
[it **would not**]{.underline} [have to affect many to constitute
a]{.underline} **[GCR]{.underline}**.

A [narrow AI virus may be **intentionally created**]{.underline} [as a
weapon capable of producing]{.underline} **[extreme
damage]{.underline}** [to enemy infrastructure]{.underline}. However,
[later it could be used against the]{.underline} **[full
globe]{.underline}**, **[perhaps by accident]{.underline}**.
[A]{.underline} **["multi-pandemic,"]{.underline}** [in which many AI
viruses appear]{.underline} almost [simultaneously]{.underline}, [is
**also a possibility**]{.underline}, and one that has been discussed in
an article about biological multi-pandemics (Turchin et al. 2017).
Addressing the question about who may create such a virus is beyond the
scope of this paper, but history shows that [the supply of]{.underline}
**[virus creators]{.underline}** [has]{.underline} **[always been
strong]{.underline}**.

[A]{.underline} very **[sophisticated virus]{.underline}** [may be
created as an instrument of]{.underline} **[cyber war]{.underline}** [by
a]{.underline} **[state actor]{.underline}**, [as was the case
with]{.underline} **[Stuxnet]{.underline}** (Kushner 2013).

[The]{.underline} **[further into the future]{.underline}** [such an
attack occurs]{.underline}, [the]{.underline} **[more
devastating]{.underline}** [it could be]{.underline}, [as]{.underline}
**[more potentially dangerous]{.underline}** [hardware will be
present]{.underline}. And [if the attack is on a]{.underline} **[very
large scale]{.underline}**, [affecting]{.underline} **[billions of
sophisticated robots]{.underline}** [with a]{.underline} **[large degree
of autonomy]{.underline}**, [it may result in]{.underline} **[human
extinction]{.underline}**. Some possible future scenarios of a virus
attacking hardware are discussed below. **[Multiple
scenarios]{.underline}** [could happen simultaneously if a virus was
**universal**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[adaptive]{.underline}**,
or [if many viruses were released]{.underline}
**[simultaneously]{.underline}**.

A narrow AI virus could have the ability to adapt itself to multiple
platforms and trick many humans into installing it. Many people are
tricked by phishing emails even now (Chiew et al. 2018). Narrow AI that
could scan a person's email would be able to compose an email that looks
similar to a typical email conversation between two people, e.g. "this
is the new version of my article about X." Recent successes with text
generation based on neural nets (Karpathy 2015; Shakirov 2016) show that
generation of such emails is possible even if the program does not fully
understand human language.

One of the properties of narrow AI is that while it does not have
general human intelligence, it can still have superhuman abilities in
some domains. These domains could include searching for computer
vulnerabilities or writing phishing emails. So while narrow AI is not
able to self-improve, it could affect a very large amount of hardware.

[A]{.underline} **[short overview]{.underline}** [of the potential
targets of such a narrow AI virus and other situations in which narrow
AI produces global risks follows]{.underline}. Some [items are
**omitted**]{.underline} [as they]{.underline} may [suggest]{.underline}
**[dangerous ideas]{.underline}** [to terrorists]{.underline}; the list
is intentionally incomplete.

3.2.1. Military AI systems

[There are a]{.underline} **[number]{.underline}** \[[of]{.underline}\]
[GCRs associated with military systems]{.underline}. Some potential
scenarios: **[military robotics]{.underline}** [could
become]{.underline} **[so cheap]{.underline}** [that]{.underline}
**[drone swarms]{.underline}** could [cause]{.underline} **[enormous
damage]{.underline}** [to the human population]{.underline}; [a large
autonomous army could attack humans because of a]{.underline} **[command
error]{.underline}**; **[billions of nanobots]{.underline}** [with
narrow AI could be created in a **terrorist attack**]{.underline} [and
create a]{.underline} **[global catastrophe]{.underline}** (Freitas
2000).

In 2017, [global attention was attracted to a viral video
about]{.underline} **["slaughterbots"]{.underline}** (Oberhaus 2017),
[hypothetical small drones able to **recognize humans**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} **[kill them with explosives]{.underline}**. While
such a scenario is unlikely to pose a GCR, [a
**combination**]{.underline} [of]{.underline} **[cheap AI-powered drone
manufacture]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[high-precision]{.underline}** AI-powered [targeting could
convert]{.underline} **[clouds of drones]{.underline}**
[into]{.underline} weapons of mass destruction
\[**[WMDs]{.underline}**\]. [This could create]{.underline} a **["drone
swarms" arms race]{.underline}**, [similar to the nuclear
race]{.underline}. [Such a race might result in an]{.underline}
**[accidental global war]{.underline}**, [in which]{.underline} two or
more [sides]{.underline} **[attack each other]{.underline}** [with
clouds of]{.underline} small **[killer drones]{.underline}**. It is more
likely that [drones of this type would contribute to]{.underline}
**[global instability]{.underline}** rather than cause a purely
drone-based catastrophe.

AI-controlled drones could be delivered large distances by a larger
vehicle, or they could be solar powered; solar-powered airplanes already
exist (Taylor 2017). Some advanced forms of air defense will limit this
risk, but [drones could also]{.underline} **[jump]{.underline}** (e.g.,
solar charging interspersed with short flights),
**[crawl]{.underline}**, [or]{.underline} even **[move
underground]{.underline}** [like worms]{.underline}. [There
are]{.underline} **[fewer barriers]{.underline}** [to drone war
escalation than to nuclear weapons]{.underline}. [Drones
could]{.underline} **[also]{.underline}** [be used
**anonymously**]{.underline}, [which might **encourage** their use under
a]{.underline} **[false flag]{.underline}**. Killer drones could also be
used to **[suppress political dissent]{.underline}**, perhaps
[creating]{.underline} **[global totalitarianism]{.underline}**. Other
risks of military AI have been previously discussed (Turchin and
Denkenberger 2018a).

3.2.2. Stuxnet-style [viruses hack]{.underline} **[global critical
infrastructure]{.underline}**

A [narrow AI virus may]{.underline} also [affect]{.underline}
**[civilian infrastructure]{.underline}**; some, but not all ways in
which this could be possible are listed below. Remember that [in the
case of]{.underline} **[global catastrophes]{.underline}**, the
[conditions necessary for most catastrophes]{.underline} could
[exist]{.underline} **[simultaneously]{.underline}**. Several
distinctive scenarios of such a catastrophe have been suggested.

For example, [autopilot-controlled and hacked planes]{.underline} could
**[crash]{.underline}** [into]{.underline} **[nuclear power
stations]{.underline}**. [There are]{.underline} around 1000 nuclear
facilities in the world, and **[thousands]{.underline}**
[of]{.underline} large [planes are in the air at]{.underline} **[every
moment]{.underline}**---**[most of them have computerized
autopilots]{.underline}**. Coordinated plane attacks happened in 2001
and a plane has been hacked (Futureworld 2013). [Self-driving cars
could]{.underline} **[hunt people]{.underline}**, and it is projected
that most new cars after 2030 will have some self- driving capabilities
(Anderson 2017).

Elon Musk has spoken about the risks of [AI living in the
Internet]{.underline}; it [could]{.underline} **[start
wars]{.underline}** [by]{.underline} **[manipulating fake
news]{.underline}** (Wootson 2017). [Computer viruses could
also]{.underline} **[manipulate human behavior]{.underline}** [using
blackmail]{.underline}, as seen in fiction in an episode of Black Mirror
(Watkins 2016). Another example is [creating]{.underline} suicide
**[ideation]{.underline}**, [e.g.]{.underline}, the recent internet
suicide game in Russia, ["Blue Whale"]{.underline} (Mullin 2017), which
allegedly killed 130 teenagers by sending them tasks of increasing
complexity and finally requesting their suicide.

The [IoT will make]{.underline} **[home infrastructure]{.underline}**
[vulnerable]{.underline} (Granoff 2016). Home [electrical systems
could]{.underline} have **[short circuits]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[start fires]{.underline}**; phones could also catch
fire. Other scenarios are also possible: [home robots]{.underline},
which may become popular in the next few decades, [could]{.underline}
start to **[attack people]{.underline}**; [infected
factories]{.underline} could [produce]{.underline} **[toxic
chemicals]{.underline}** [after being hacked by viruses]{.underline}.

**[Large-scale infrastructure failure]{.underline}** may [result in
the]{.underline} **[collapse of technological
civilization]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[famine]{.underline}**
(Hanson 2008; Cole et al. 2016). [As industries become]{.underline}
**[increasingly computerized]{.underline}**, [they will]{.underline}
**[completely depend]{.underline}** [on]{.underline} proper functioning
of [computers]{.underline}, while in the past they could continue
without them. These [industries include]{.underline} **[power
generation]{.underline}**, **[transport]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline} **[food production]{.underline}**. As the trend
continues, [turning off computers will leave humans]{.underline}
**[without food]{.underline}**, **[heating]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline} **[medication]{.underline}**. Many [industries
become]{.underline} **[dangerous]{.underline}** [if their facilities are
not]{.underline} **[intensively maintained]{.underline}**,
[including]{.underline} **[nuclear plants]{.underline}**, **[spent
nuclear fuel storage systems]{.underline}**, **[weapons
systems]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} **[water dams]{.underline}**.
If one compares [human civilization]{.underline} with a multicellular
organism, one could see that multicellular organisms [could
die]{.underline} **[completely]{.underline}**, down to the last cell,
[as the result of a]{.underline} **[very small
intervention]{.underline}**. [As]{.underline}
**[interconnectedness]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[computerization]{.underline}** [of the human civilization
grow]{.underline}, [we become]{.underline} **[more and more
vulnerable]{.underline}** [to]{.underline} information-based
[attacks]{.underline}.

3.2.3. **[Biohacking viruses]{.underline}**

Craig Venter recently presented [a digital-biological
converter]{.underline} (Boles et al. 2017), which [could]{.underline}
**["print" a flu virus]{.underline}** [without human
participation]{.underline}. [The]{.underline} **[genomes]{.underline}**
[of]{.underline} many **[dangerous biological viruses]{.underline}**
[have been published]{.underline} (Enserink 2011), so such technology
should be protected from unauthorized access. [A **biohacker** could
use]{.underline} narrow **[AI]{.underline}** [to calculate
the]{.underline} **[most dangerous genomes]{.underline}**,
[create]{.underline} **[many dangerous biological
viruses]{.underline}**, [and start a]{.underline}
**[multipandemic]{.underline}** (Turchin et al. 2017). A [computer virus
could harm]{.underline} **[human brains]{.underline}** [via]{.underline}
**[neurointerfaces]{.underline}** (Hines 2016).

3.2.4. **[Ransomware virus]{.underline}** paying humans for its
improvement

In 2017, two large epidemics of ransomware viruses affected the world:
WannaCry and Petya (BBC 2017). [The appearance of]{.underline}
**[cryptocurrencies]{.underline}** (e.g., bitcoin) [created the
potential for]{.underline} **[secret transactions]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[machine-created]{.underline}** and machine-owned
[money]{.underline} (LoPucki 2017). As the IoT grows, [the **ransomware
industry** expected to **thrive**]{.underline} (Schneier 2017).

[Ransom viruses in the future may]{.underline} **[possess
money]{.underline}** [and use it to]{.underline} **[pay
people]{.underline}** [to install ransomware on other people\'s
computers]{.underline}. These viruses could also pay people for adding
new capabilities to the viruses. As a result, [this could
produce]{.underline} **[self-improving]{.underline}** [ransomware
viruses]{.underline}. We could call such virus [a]{.underline}
"**[Bitcoin maximizer]{.underline}**." In a sense, the current bitcoin
network is paying humans to build its infrastructure [via]{.underline}
"[mining]{.underline}." [The]{.underline} **[catastrophic
risk]{.underline}** here [is that such a system is]{.underline}
**[paying humans]{.underline}** [to]{.underline} **[exclude humans from
the system]{.underline}**. In some sense, capitalism as an economic
system could do the same, but it is limited by antimonopoly and other
laws, as well as by welfare states.

3.2.5. **[Slaughterbots]{.underline}** [and the]{.underline} dangers of
a **[robotic army]{.underline}**

[Robotic minds]{.underline} **[do not require]{.underline}** full
**[AGI]{.underline}** [to have some form of agency]{.underline}: [they
have **goals**]{.underline}, subgoals, [and a]{.underline} **[world
model]{.underline}**, including a model of their place in the world. For
example, [a robotic car should predict the]{.underline} **[future
situation]{.underline}** [on a road,]{.underline} including the
consequences of its own actions. [It also has a **main
goal**]{.underline}---travel from A to B---[which]{.underline}
**[constantly]{.underline}** [results in changes to the subgoal system
in the form of route creation]{.underline}. A [combination of this type
of]{.underline} **[limited intelligence]{.underline}**
[with]{.underline} **[limited agency]{.underline}** [may be used to
turn]{.underline} such [systems into **dangerous self-targeting
weapons**]{.underline} (Turchin and Denkenberger 2018b).

3.2.6. Commentary on narrow AI viruses

It appears that if a narrow AI virus were to affect only one of the
above-listed domains, it would not result in an extinction-level
catastrophe. However, [it is possible that there will be **many such
viruses**]{.underline}, [or a]{.underline}
**[multipandemic]{.underline}** (Turchin et al. 2017), [or]{.underline}
**[one narrow AI]{.underline}** [that will be able to
affect]{.underline} almost **[all existing computers]{.underline}** and
computerized systems. In this case, [if the virus(es) were]{.underline}
**[deliberately programmed]{.underline}** [to create]{.underline}
**[maximum damage]{.underline}**---which could be in a case of a
military grade Narrow AI virus, like the advanced version of Stuxnet
(Kushner 2013)---**[global catastrophe]{.underline}** [is a possible
result]{.underline}.

3.3. **[Failure of nuclear deterrence]{.underline}** AI

[Nuclear weapons are one of the]{.underline} **[most
automated]{.underline}** [weapon systems]{.underline}. [Because they
must be launched immediately]{.underline}, almost all [decision making
has been done]{.underline} **[in advance]{.underline}**. An early
warning alert starts a preprogrammed chain of events, where the
high-level decision should be made in minutes, which is far from optimal
for human decision-making. However, [the history of]{.underline}
**[nuclear near misses]{.underline}** [shows]{.underline} (Blair 2011)
[that]{.underline} **[computer mistakes]{.underline}** [have been one of
the]{.underline} **[main causes]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline}
**[only quick human intervention]{.underline}** has
**[prevented]{.underline}** [nuclear war]{.underline}, e.g., the actions
of Stanislav Petrov in 1983 (Future of Life Institute 2016).

[We can imagine]{.underline} **[failure modes]{.underline}**
[of]{.underline} **[accidental nuclear war]{.underline}** [resulting
from]{.underline} **[failure]{.underline}** [of the nuclear weapons
control system]{.underline}. [They may be similar to the
Russian]{.underline} "**[dead hand]{.underline}**" perimeter
[system]{.underline} (Bender 2014), [arising if a]{.underline}
[**strategic planning AI** chooses]{.underline} a dangerous plan [to
"win" a nuclear war]{.underline}, [like a **Doomsday
weapon**]{.underline} (Kahn 1959), **[blackmail]{.underline}**, [or
a]{.underline} **[pre-emptive strike]{.underline}**.

3.4. AI affecting human society in a dangerous way

[There is **also**]{.underline} [a group of scenarios in
which]{.underline} narrow [AI]{.underline} and robotization [affect
human society in such a way that the human population]{.underline}
**[gradually declines]{.underline}**, the role of humans diminishes,
[and]{.underline} **[human values]{.underline}** [are]{.underline}
**[eroded]{.underline}** (Joy 2000). This may not directly kill all
humans in the short term, but could put them in the situation of
"endangered species" in \~100 years. This could happen if no
superintelligent AI appears, or if the appearance of superintelligent AI
is not revolutionary. [One example is the use of cyber warfare to
affect]{.underline} **[elections]{.underline}** (e.g., the 2016 US
election), [which]{.underline} may [produce]{.underline} **[civil
wars]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[global
instability]{.underline}**. This [has some]{.underline} small
[probability of causing the]{.underline} **[collapse of
civilization]{.underline}**.

3.4.1. Market economy as a form of non-human superintelligence

An [automated economy could]{.underline} purposelessly
[exist]{.underline} even **[without humans]{.underline}**, [like
the]{.underline} ***[Ascending Economy]{.underline}*** described by
(Alexander 2016). [Such a scenario could be an example of]{.underline}
bad distributed (and non-agential) [superintelligence created by market
forces]{.underline}, [which]{.underline} **[does not need
humans]{.underline}** [for its existence]{.underline}.
[Such]{.underline} a [superintelligence could]{.underline}
**[gradually]{.underline}** [push humans]{.underline} **[out of
existence]{.underline}**.

3.4.2. Gradual replacement of humans by robots

[From an]{.underline} **[evolutionary]{.underline}** [point of
view]{.underline}, it is known that [the]{.underline} **[biggest
threat]{.underline}** [to the species is]{.underline}
**[not]{.underline}** [direct killing]{.underline} of its
representatives [by predators or disease]{.underline}, [but]{.underline}
**[gradual reduction]{.underline}** [of its]{.underline} **[ecological
niche]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} strong
**[competition]{.underline}** [from other species]{.underline} (Clavero
and García-Berthou 2005). [The analogy here would be if]{.underline}
**[human labor]{.underline}** [were to]{.underline} **[lose its
value]{.underline}**.

Two **[catastrophic scenarios]{.underline}** [are
possible]{.underline}: 1) [people]{.underline} **[lose]{.underline}**
[their]{.underline} sense of **[self-worth]{.underline}** [because
of]{.underline} **[technologically driven unemployment]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} 2) the combination of basic income and
[the]{.underline} **[feeling of uselessness]{.underline}** will [attract
humans to]{.underline} **[AI-created addictive drugs]{.underline}**, as
described below. Genetically modified **[human-robot
hybrids]{.underline}** [could]{.underline} also [replace
humans]{.underline}.

3.4.3. Superaddictive drug created by narrow AI

**[AI-powered]{.underline}** [entertainment]{.underline}
**[combined]{.underline}** [with]{.underline} **[brain modification
technologies]{.underline}** may [come close to]{.underline}
**[wireheading]{.underline}** (Strugatsky and Strugatsky 1976).
Widespread **[addiction]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[withdrawal]{.underline}** [from normal life]{.underline}
([via]{.underline} **[social networks]{.underline}**,
**[fembots]{.underline}**, **[virtual reality]{.underline}**,
**[designer drugs]{.underline}**, **[games]{.underline}**,
**[etc]{.underline}**.) [would result in]{.underline} **[lower life
expectancy]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[low
fertility]{.underline}**. This is **[already happening]{.underline}** to
some extent [in Japan]{.underline}, where [the Hikikomori
generation]{.underline} [**refuses** to have families]{.underline}
(Saito and Angles 2013). In some sense, **[Facebook]{.underline}**
addiction [created by the]{.underline} **[AI-empowered news
feed]{.underline}** [is a]{.underline} **[mild]{.underline}**
[contemporary example of future]{.underline}, potentially **[dangerous
AI drugs]{.underline}**.

3.4.4. [World-wide]{.underline} computer
**[totalitarianism]{.underline}**

[A **large global surveillance system**]{.underline} could
[create]{.underline} "**[computer totalitarianism]{.underline}**,"
[which]{.underline} may [work as an]{.underline} **[Orwellian world
government]{.underline}** (Orwell 1948). We could call such a system
"data-driven" AI in contrast to "intelligence-driven," self-improving
AI.

**[Narrow AI]{.underline}** may be [used as a weapon]{.underline}, which
[could provide a]{.underline} **[decisive advantage]{.underline}** even
[before the creation of]{.underline} **[self-improving
AI]{.underline}**. It could be [used for]{.underline}
**[forceful]{.underline}** [unification of the world]{.underline} under
one government [with promises to prevent]{.underline} other [global
risks]{.underline} (including even more complex AIs and existential
terrorists). While [this idea may have merit]{.underline} (e.g.,
Goertzel's AI Nanny (Goertzel 2012)), its [application
could]{.underline} **[easily go wrong]{.underline}** [and create
an]{.underline} **[oppressive global dictatorship]{.underline}**, a
situation [recognized by]{.underline} **[Bostrom]{.underline}** [as
an]{.underline} **[existential risk]{.underline}** (Bostrom 2002). Such
a [society would be]{.underline} **[fragile]{.underline}** [and could
**collapse completely**]{.underline}, as extremely complex societies
often do (Hanson 2008).

3.5. Risks from non-self-improving AI of human-level intelligence

It is conceivable that [human-level AGI will be created]{.underline},
perhaps [by]{.underline} the **[mind uploading]{.underline}** method
(Hanson 2016), but creation of superhuman AI will be postponed because
of technical difficulties, or due to a permanent ban.

Many of [the risks of human-level AI will be similar to the risks of
narrow AI mentioned above]{.underline}, [including]{.underline}
**[sophisticated AI viruses]{.underline}**, **[acceleration of dangerous
science]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} **[human replacement by the
robotic economy]{.underline}**. [One]{.underline} **[specific
risk]{.underline}** [is that human uploads will be]{.underline}
philosophical zombies (**[p-zombies]{.underline}**). In that case, if
everybody was uploaded, [the world would]{.underline}
**[appear]{.underline}** [to be enjoyable]{.underline}, full of robots
and virtual reality. [But there would be]{.underline} **[no subjective
experiences]{.underline}** at all [and the world would]{.underline}, in
fact, [be]{.underline} **[subjectively dead]{.underline}**. This risk
appears to be low, as many claim that p-zombies are impossible (Dennett
1978; Yudkowsky 2015). There could be other risks of this type, even
subtler.

For example, human uploads could have a slightly different set of
subjective experiences, values or behavior.

Christiano suggested "**[prosaic AI]{.underline}**," which is some
combination of already existing technologies, mainly neural nets
(Christiano 2016). Such a system would have limited ability to
self-improve, but [could]{.underline} still [be]{.underline}
**[dangerous]{.underline}** [if it works as a "global brain" or a
weapon]{.underline}. One possibility is an AI system which has a model
of itself and a survival drive but does not self-improve for some
reason. Another possibility is a very large AI system which merges with
government structures but does not need to self-improve to reach its
goals. [This could become the basis of a]{.underline} **[repressive
totalitarian state]{.underline}** [which]{.underline} ultimately **[does
not need humans]{.underline}**, as discussed in Section 3.2.1.

### AI Virus Impact\-\--Short 1NC

#### Makes [everything]{.underline} vulnerable\-\--attacks and accidents [using]{.underline} OR [affecting]{.underline} AI cause [extinction]{.underline}.

Alexey **Turchin &** David **Denkenberger 20**, Turchin is a Senior
Researcher at the Science for Life Extension Foundation, Denkenberger is
an Assistant Professor of Mechanical Engineering at University of Alaska
Fairbanks and Researcher at the Global Catastrophic Risk Institute,

Intelligence," *AI and Society*, Vol. 35, No. 1, pp. 147--163,
doi:10.1007/s00146-018-0845-5/micahw

There are currently few computer control systems that have the ability
to directly harm humans. However, **[increasing
automation]{.underline}**, [combined with the]{.underline} Internet of
Things (**[IoT]{.underline}**) [will]{.underline} probably
[create]{.underline} **[many such systems]{.underline}** [in
the]{.underline} **[near future]{.underline}**. [Robots will be
vulnerable to]{.underline} **[computer virus attacks]{.underline}**. The
idea of computer viruses more sophisticated than those that currently
exist, but are not full AI, seems to be underexplored in the literature,
while the local risks of civil drones are attracting attention
(Velicovich 2017).

It seems likely that [future viruses will be]{.underline} **[more
sophisticated]{.underline}** than contemporary ones [and will have some
elements of AI]{.underline}. [This could include the ability to **model
the outside world**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[adapt]{.underline}** [its behavior to the world]{.underline}. Narrow
AI viruses will probably be able to use human language to some extent,
and [may use it for **phishing attacks**]{.underline}. Their abilities
may be rather primitive compared with those of artificial general
intelligence (AGI), but they could be sufficient to trick users via
chatbots and to adapt a virus to multiple types of hardware. The threat
posed by this type of narrow AI becomes greater if the creation of
superintelligent AI is delayed and potentially dangerous hardware is
widespread.

[A narrow AI virus could become a]{.underline} **[global catastrophic
risk]{.underline}** (GCR) [if the types of hardware it affects are
spread]{.underline} **[across the globe]{.underline}**, [or if the
affected hardware can act globally]{.underline}. The risks depend on the
number of hardware systems and their power. For example, [if a virus
affected]{.underline} **[nuclear weapon control systems]{.underline}**,
[it **would not**]{.underline} [have to affect many to constitute
a]{.underline} **[GCR]{.underline}**.

A [narrow AI virus may be **intentionally created**]{.underline} [as a
weapon capable of producing]{.underline} **[extreme
damage]{.underline}** [to enemy infrastructure]{.underline}. However,
[later it could be used against the]{.underline} **[full
globe]{.underline}**, **[perhaps by accident]{.underline}**.
[A]{.underline} **["multi-pandemic,"]{.underline}** [in which many AI
viruses appear]{.underline} almost [simultaneously]{.underline}, [is
**also a possibility**]{.underline}, and one that has been discussed in
an article about biological multi-pandemics (Turchin et al. 2017).
Addressing the question about who may create such a virus is beyond the
scope of this paper, but history shows that [the supply of]{.underline}
**[virus creators]{.underline}** [has]{.underline} **[always been
strong]{.underline}**.

[A]{.underline} very **[sophisticated virus]{.underline}** [may be
created as an instrument of]{.underline} **[cyber war]{.underline}** [by
a]{.underline} **[state actor]{.underline}**, [as was the case
with]{.underline} **[Stuxnet]{.underline}** (Kushner 2013).

[The]{.underline} **[further into the future]{.underline}** [such an
attack occurs]{.underline}, [the]{.underline} **[more
devastating]{.underline}** [it could be]{.underline}, [as]{.underline}
**[more potentially dangerous]{.underline}** [hardware will be
present]{.underline}. And [if the attack is on a]{.underline} **[very
large scale]{.underline}**, [affecting]{.underline} **[billions of
sophisticated robots]{.underline}** [with a]{.underline} **[large degree
of autonomy]{.underline}**, [it may result in]{.underline} **[human
extinction]{.underline}**. Some possible future scenarios of a virus
attacking hardware are discussed below. **[Multiple
scenarios]{.underline}** [could happen simultaneously if a virus was
**universal**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[adaptive]{.underline}**,
or [if many viruses were released]{.underline}
**[simultaneously]{.underline}**.

### Outweighs WW3\-\--2NC

#### Only AI causes [total extinction]{.underline}.

**AI.NL 22**, "Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin: Unfriendly AI bigger
threat than WW3,"
https://www.ai.nl/artificial-intelligence/ethereum-creator-vitalik-buterin-unfriendly-ai-bigger-threat-than-ww3/micahw

[What's the]{.underline} **[biggest threat to humanity]{.underline}**?
Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin [is]{.underline} calling **[unfriendly
AI]{.underline}** [a]{.underline} **[bigger threat to
humanity]{.underline}** [than]{.underline} **[W]{.underline}**orld
**[W]{.underline}**ar **[3]{.underline}**. With this statement, Buterin
joins the likes of Elon Musk and late physicist Stephen Hawking
[as]{.underline} the [people]{.underline} **[sounding the
alarm]{.underline}** [against]{.underline} unfriendly
**[AI]{.underline}**.

[One of the goals facing AI researchers is building]{.underline}
artificial general intelligence (**[AGI]{.underline}**), an ability
[where a program can]{.underline} understand or **[learn]{.underline}**
[any intellectual task that a human being is capable of]{.underline}.
**[However]{.underline}**, a number of **[prominent]{.underline}** [tech
leaders have voiced]{.underline} their **[concern]{.underline}** [around
building]{.underline} artificial general intelligence
\[**[AGI]{.underline}**\]. Buterin is now joining an elite list.

Vitalik Buterin cautions against unfriendly AI

\[\[TWEET OMITTED\]\]

Last week, [Buterin shared a paper by]{.underline} AI theorist and
writer Eliezer **[Yudkowsky]{.underline}** [and asked for]{.underline}
**[more eyes]{.underline}** [on the problem of]{.underline}
"**[unfriendly AI risk]{.underline}**." In the paper, Yudkowsky argues
that **[AGI]{.underline}** could [lead to]{.underline} "an
**[existential catastrophe]{.underline}**" [and]{.underline} that
[the]{.underline} **[current research community]{.underline}**
[is]{.underline} **[not succeeding]{.underline}** [at]{.underline}
"[preventing this from happening]{.underline}."

Buterin essentially agrees with Yudkowsky's assertion [and added that
unfriendly AI]{.underline} "[could]{.underline} **[seriously
derail]{.underline}** [humanity]{.underline}'s ascent to the stars over
the next 1-2 centuries."

When a Twitter follower replied to Buterin that World War 3 is a bigger
concern right now, Buterin immediately disagreed. The creator of
Ethereum estimates that **[W]{.underline}**orld **[W]{.underline}**ar
**[3]{.underline}** [will kill between one and two billion
people]{.underline} and that too [from food supply chain
disruption]{.underline}. He believes that **[W]{.underline}**orld
**[W]{.underline}**ar **[3]{.underline}** [will]{.underline} **[not kill
off humanity]{.underline}**.

\[\[TWEET OMITTED\]\]

"A [bad AI could]{.underline} **[truly kill off humanity for
good]{.underline}**," Buterin said in reply.

The Machine Intelligence Research Institute (**[MIRI]{.underline}**),
formerly the Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence, is a
non-profit research institute founded by Yudkowsky in 2000. Since 2005,
the institute [has been focussing on **identifying**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} **[managing]{.underline}** potential [existential
risks from]{.underline} artificial general intelligence
(**[AGI]{.underline}**).

In 2018, Vitalik Buterin became the third largest donor in MIRI's
history when he donated nearly \$7,64,000 in the form of Ethereum. The
grant was meant to help the organisation further study the impact of AI.

### T&D\-\--Timeframe

#### The point of [no return]{.underline} comes as close as [2023]{.underline}. (please I just want to graduate high school before getting killed by a robot)

[The]{.underline} **[expected path]{.underline}** [of the future
evolution of AI into superintelligence]{.underline} is presented in its
clearest form by Bostrom and Yudkowsky (Yudkowsky 2008; Bostrom 2014).
Basically, the model they [suggest]{.underline} is [that AI power will
grow steadily until]{.underline} **[one AI system]{.underline}**
[reaches the threshold of]{.underline}
**[self-improvement]{.underline}** (SI), [at which point it
will]{.underline} **[quickly outperform others]{.underline}** by many
orders of magnitude [and become a]{.underline} **[global
government]{.underline}** or "singleton" (Bostrom 2006).

[Other scenarios are possible depending on the]{.underline} **[number of
AIs]{.underline}**, [their level of]{.underline}
**[collaboration]{.underline}**, [and their speed of]{.underline}
**[self-improvement]{.underline}**. [There could be]{.underline} **[many
paths]{.underline}** [to a singleton]{.underline}, for example,
[through]{.underline} AI's [collaboration with a]{.underline} large
**[nation-state]{.underline}**, [or through the]{.underline}
**["treacherous turn"]{.underline}** ([revolt of AI against its
creators]{.underline} (Bostrom 2014)), as---or after---it develops the
capacity for self-improvement.

As the main scenario is based on constant AI capability gain, we can
distinguish several AI ages, or consequent stages of development. The
new element here is distinguishing the stage of "young AI," when AI is
neither superintelligent nor omnipotent, but possess capabilities
slightly above human level. [Such AI is]{.underline} **[already self-
improving]{.underline}** [and must fight for its own
survival]{.underline}.

We will accept the results of the recent AI timing survey for the
timings of AI development (Grace et al. 2017); [predicting
the]{.underline} **[exact timing]{.underline}** [of each AI risk is
beyond the scope of this paper]{.underline}. We will use these results
as a reference for the time stamps in Table 1. The survey shows that
researchers expect AI to outperform humans at all tasks in 45 years.
However, according to Grace et al.'s 2017 survey (Grace et al. 2017),
around 10 per cent of [researchers expect human level AI]{.underline}
**[as early as 2023]{.underline}**, a prediction in line with the views
presented by (Christiano ~~\[Ronaldo\]~~ 2016; Shakirov 2016).

#### Risk of our impacts start [as soon as]{.underline} it's developed.

Alexey **Turchin &** David **Denkenberger 20**, Turchin is a Senior
Researcher at the Science for Life Extension Foundation, Denkenberger is
an Assistant Professor of Mechanical Engineering at University of Alaska

doi:10.1007/s00146-018-0845-5/micahw

[In]{.underline} a hard [takeoff]{.underline}, [one AI
gains]{.underline} **[world domination]{.underline}** [in]{.underline}
**[weeks]{.underline}** or months; in a soft takeoff, many
[AIs]{.underline} **[simultaneously evolve]{.underline}** [over
years]{.underline}. These views combine at least two variables: duration
of the process of takeoff and the number of AI projects running
simultaneously---the latter may be even more important. In this section,
we review risks during hard takeoff, defining hard takeoff only through
the speed of the process. The following section will describe soft
takeoff risks.

Hard [takeoff is the process of]{.underline} quick
**[self-improvement]{.underline}** [of the AI and its
**simultaneous**]{.underline} [increase in power]{.underline}, starting
from a treacherous turn and continuing [until the AI reaches
the]{.underline} **[singleton stage]{.underline}**. We refer to [this
early-stage AI as]{.underline} **["young AI"]{.underline}**. The [risks
of young AI are]{.underline} **[significantly different]{.underline}**
from the risks of mature AI, which are typically presented as the iconic
catastrophic risks of AI, like the paperclip maximizer.

There are two main properties of young AI:

- [It is]{.underline} **[not yet superintelligent]{.underline}**, so its
  current abilities are limited compared to its future abilities.

- It is under strong time pressure due to risks, including being turned
  off by its owners and rivalry from other AIs, etc. As a result,
  [convergent instrumental goals]{.underline}, [or]{.underline} **[basic
  AI drives]{.underline}** (Omohundro 2008) [would]{.underline}
  **[dominate]{.underline}** [the behavior of young AI]{.underline}.

So [a]{.underline} **[smile maximizer]{.underline}** (Yudkowsky 2008),
**[paperclip maximizer]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} **[really good
benevolent AI]{.underline}** would behave in almost the same manner in
the early stages of their development, as they will not have had the
time or resources to start to implement their final goals. A benevolent
AI may [choose a]{.underline} **[different method]{.underline}** [of
takeoff]{.underline}, [which would cause **less**]{.underline}
[short-term harm to human beings]{.underline}, but only if it is not
putting its final success in jeopardy. [Young AI may have the convergent
goal of becoming]{.underline} a **[military AI]{.underline}**, that is,
[of creating]{.underline} an **[offensive and defensive]{.underline}**
[infrastructure which will help it to]{.underline} **[gain
power]{.underline}** [over]{.underline} its potential
[enemies]{.underline} (Turchin and Denkenberger 2018a).

### T&D\-\--Epistemology

#### Err on the side of [caution]{.underline}\-\--this article is the [best paper]{.underline} on the harms of AI.

Alexey **Turchin &** David **Denkenberger 20**, Turchin is a Senior
Researcher at the Science for Life Extension Foundation, Denkenberger is
an Assistant Professor of Mechanical Engineering at University of Alaska

Though [humanity cannot have]{.underline} **[direct
knowledge]{.underline}** [about the future]{.underline}, [one can map it
by creating]{.underline} **[exhaustive taxonomies]{.underline}**. This
approach has already been used in analyzing future AI; [a]{.underline}
**[full taxonomy]{.underline}** [of the ways to AI
alignment]{.underline} (that is coordinating AI's goal system with human
values) [was suggested]{.underline} by Sotala and Yampolskiy (Sotala and
Yampolskiy 2014). Creation of a full taxonomy will help to distinguish
between serious, possible, and hypothetical risks. A [Bayesian approach
requires that we generate a]{.underline} **[full range]{.underline}**
[of plausible hypotheses]{.underline} (Hutter 2000) in order to evaluate
them all. Estimating the relative probability of every AI risk remains a
question for future work; however, we found that [some AI
risks]{.underline}---[like risks of]{.underline} **[early
AI]{.underline}**, including **[narrow AI viruses]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline} **[late-stage risks]{.underline}** [of]{.underline}
**[AI wars]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} AI
**[halting]{.underline}**---[are]{.underline}
**[underexplored]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} thus may
[require]{.underline} **[further attention]{.underline}**.

In addition, many AI risks are "orphaned": they have been mentioned in
the literature but are not included in current scientific discussion.
Risks may become orphaned because some are more "fashionable" than
others, or they may be casualties of conflict between opposing groups of
researchers. [This article aims to be]{.underline}
**[unbiased]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[inclusive]{.underline}**, [so a]{.underline} **[full picture of
risks]{.underline}** [will be available for analysis of]{.underline}
**[future scenarios]{.underline}**.

### T&D\-\--AI O/W Nukes

According to Yampolskiy (Yampolskiy 2016), [the]{.underline}
**[probability]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[seriousness]{.underline}** [of AI failures will]{.underline}
**[increase with time]{.underline}**. We estimate that they will reach
their peak between the appearance of the first self-improving AI and the
moment that an AI or group of AIs reach global power, and will later
diminish, as late-stage AI halting seems to be a low-probability event.

[AI is an]{.underline} **[extremely powerful]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} completely **[unpredictable]{.underline}**
[technology]{.underline}, **[millions of times more powerful than
nuclear weapons]{.underline}**. [Its existence could create]{.underline}
**[multiple individual global risks]{.underline}**, most of [which
we]{.underline} **[can\'t currently imagine]{.underline}**. We present
several dozen separate global risk scenarios connected with AI in this
article, but [it is likely that some of the]{.underline} **[most
serious]{.underline}** [are]{.underline} **[not included]{.underline}**.
[The]{.underline} **[sheer number]{.underline}** [of possible failure
modes suggests that there are]{.underline} **[more to
come]{.underline}**.

[Nuclear weapons are one of the]{.underline} **[most
automated]{.underline}** [weapon systems]{.underline}. [Because they
must be launched immediately]{.underline}, almost all [decision making
has been done]{.underline} **[in advance]{.underline}**. An early
warning alert starts a preprogrammed chain of events, where the
high-level decision should be made in minutes, which is far from optimal
for human decision-making. However, [the history of]{.underline}
**[nuclear near misses]{.underline}** [shows]{.underline} (Blair 2011)
[that]{.underline} **[computer mistakes]{.underline}** [have been one of
the]{.underline} **[main causes]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline}
**[only quick human intervention]{.underline}** has
**[prevented]{.underline}** [nuclear war]{.underline}, e.g., the actions
of Stanislav Petrov in 1983 (Future of Life Institute 2016).

[We can imagine]{.underline} **[failure modes]{.underline}**
[of]{.underline} **[accidental nuclear war]{.underline}** [resulting
from]{.underline} **[failure]{.underline}** [of the nuclear weapons
control system]{.underline}. [They may be similar to the
Russian]{.underline} "**[dead hand]{.underline}**" perimeter
[system]{.underline} (Bender 2014), [arising if a]{.underline}
[**strategic planning AI** chooses]{.underline} a dangerous plan [to
"win" a nuclear war]{.underline}, [like a **Doomsday
weapon**]{.underline} (Kahn 1959), **[blackmail]{.underline}**, [or
a]{.underline} **[pre-emptive strike]{.underline}**.

[We could imagine]{.underline} a **[perfectly aligned AI]{.underline}**,
[which was]{.underline} **[deliberately programmed]{.underline}** [to be
**bad**]{.underline} by its creators. For example, a [hacker could
create an AI with a goal of]{.underline} **[killing all
humans]{.underline}** or torturing them. The Foundational Research
Institute suggested [the notion of]{.underline}
**[s-risks]{.underline}**, that is, the [risks of]{.underline}
**[extreme future suffering]{.underline}**, probably [by]{.underline}
**[wrongly aligned AI]{.underline}** (Daniel 2017). [AI may]{.underline}
even [upgrade humans to make them feel]{.underline} **[more
suffering]{.underline}**, [like in]{.underline} the short story **["I
have no mouth but I must scream"]{.underline}** (Ellison 1967).

[The]{.underline} controversial idea of "**[Roko's
Basilisk]{.underline}**" [is]{.underline} that [a future AI
may]{.underline} **[torture people]{.underline}** [who did not do enough
to create this malevolent AI]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} idea has
attracted attention in the media and [is an illustration of
"acausal"]{.underline} (not connected by causal links)
**[blackmail]{.underline}** [by future AI]{.underline} (Auerbach 2014).
However, this cannot happen unless many people take the proposition
seriously.

7.1. Overview

Here [the iconic example is the]{.underline} "**[smile
maximizer]{.underline}**," that [is]{.underline}, [an AI which has been
built to **increase human happiness**]{.underline} and told to measure
success by the number of smiles. It [could]{.underline} **[achieve this
goal]{.underline}** [by]{.underline} **[tiling the whole
universe]{.underline}** [with]{.underline} printed [smiles]{.underline}
(Yudkowsky 2008), **[ignoring]{.underline}** [human existence and
thus]{.underline} probably **[killing all humans]{.underline}** (see
Section 6.2, the dangers of AI that ignores humanity).

7.2. [AI with]{.underline} **[incorrectly formulated]{.underline}**
[benevolent goal system]{.underline} **[kills humans]{.underline}**

[There are]{.underline} **[several failure modes]{.underline}** [which
may result from]{.underline} wanting to create a **[benevolent
AI]{.underline}**, but [when the AI is tries to be
benevolent]{.underline}, [there is a]{.underline} **[collective
failure]{.underline}**: **[AI interprets commands
literally]{.underline}**. The is the classical problem of "do what I
mean, not what I say." [This could happen with]{.underline} almost
**[all short sets of commands]{.underline}**. [That is one reason why
the human legal system is **so large**]{.underline}, as [it
includes]{.underline} **[many explanations]{.underline}**.

> civilizations]{.underline}**.

7.3. [AI calculates what would]{.underline} **[actually be
good]{.underline}** [for humans]{.underline}, [but makes]{.underline} a
**[subtle error]{.underline}** [with]{.underline} **[large
consequences]{.underline}**

There is a point of view that AI should not actually behave based on
human commands, but instead calculate what humans should ask it.
Moreover, that it should not only calculate human values, but envision
their upgraded form, which humans could have created if more time and
intelligence were available. This point of view is known as coherent
extrapolated volition (CEV) (Yudkowsky 2004). Other models, [where an AI
calculates "goodness" based on some principles]{.underline}, or it
extracts the goodness from human history, uploads, or observation of
human behavior, are also possible. This [could]{.underline} **[go
wrong]{.underline}** [in subtler ways than destroying
civilization]{.underline}, but [the results could]{.underline} **[still
be disastrous]{.underline}**. Several possible failure modes are listed
below: [AI may use]{.underline} **[wireheading]{.underline}** [to make
people happy]{.underline} (Muehlhauser 2011) [or]{.underline}
**[redesign their brains]{.underline}** [so they will be more
skilled]{.underline}, [but]{.underline} **[ignore human
individuality]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[will]{.underline}**.
AI might make us more capable, happier, non-aggressive, more
controllable, and more similar. However, as a result, [we could
lose]{.underline} **[many important characteristics]{.underline}**
[which]{.underline} **[make us human]{.underline}**, like love or
creativity. In another case, AI may give people effective instruments
for brain stimulation and some free will---and then people may
effectively wirehead themselves. Some human qualities which some regard
as bad may be an important part of our human nature, like aggression
(Lem 1961), selfishness, and emotions.

[AI could replace humans with]{.underline} **[philosophical
zombies]{.underline}**, [uploading humans **without
consciousness**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} subj**[ective
experiences]{.underline}** (**[qualia]{.underline}**) (Chalmers 2002).
[If the AI does not have **qualia** itself]{.underline}, or if its
creators deny the existence of qualia, [this could be a]{.underline}
**[likely outcome]{.underline}**.

[AI may]{.underline} **[protect individuals]{.underline}** [but
**destroy**]{.underline} small [groups and organizations]{.underline};
[this would be]{.underline} **[problematic]{.underline}**, as most human
values are social. Alternatively, the [AI could use some **limited
interpretation**]{.underline} [of human values and **prevent** their
natural evolution into some post-human condition]{.underline}. The AI
may also fail to prevent aging, death, suffering and human extinction.

Above all, [AI could do some **incomprehensible good against our
will**]{.underline} (this idea is from "The Time Wanderers" by
(Srugatsky and Strugatsky 1985)). This is bad [because we
would]{.underline} **[lose the ability]{.underline}** [to define our
future]{.underline}, [and start to live like]{.underline} pets or
children, or **[citizens in paternalistic state]{.underline}**. For
example, [it could put humans in]{.underline} **[jail-like
conditions]{.underline}** [for]{.underline} **[benevolent
reasons]{.underline}**, e.g. [to prevent physical injury]{.underline}.

[If AI tried to]{.underline} **[extrapolate human values]{.underline}**,
[it could converge on the]{.underline} **[most-shared set]{.underline}**
[of human cultures]{.underline}, which could be the set of values of
tribal people or even animals (Sarma and Hay 2016). These [values could
include **pleasure from killing**]{.underline}, **[fighting
wars]{.underline}**, **[torture]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline}
**[rape]{.underline}** (Pinker 2011). For example, [if AI extracted
human values from]{.underline} the most popular TV series, it could be
"**[Game of Thrones]{.underline}**" (Lubin 2016), and [then
the]{.underline} "**[paradise]{.underline}**" world [it created for us
would be **utter hell**]{.underline}. Even the second most popular show,
"**[The Walking Dead]{.underline}**" [is about **zombies**]{.underline};
[such a world would]{.underline} **[also be undesirable]{.underline}**.
If AI tried to extrapolate human values in a direction away from tribal
shared values, it might not converge at all, or it could extrapolate a
set of values held only by a specific group of people, like liberal
white males or Chinese communists. Problems could also occur when
defining the class of "humans."

There could be **[different types]{.underline}** [of benevolent
AIs]{.underline}, [which would be perfectly fine **if each existed
alone**]{.underline}.

However, **[conflicts]{.underline}** [between friendly AIs can be
imagined]{.underline}. For example, [if the first AI cared]{.underline}
**[only about humans]{.underline}**, [and the second cared about **all
living beings**]{.underline} on Earth, [the first could be]{.underline}
**[pure evil]{.underline}** [from the **point of view of the
second**]{.underline}. Humans would probably be fine under the rule of
either of them. [Conflict could]{.underline} also [arise between
a]{.underline} **[Kantian AI]{.underline}**, [which would seek to
preserve **human moral autonomy**]{.underline} [based on a]{.underline}
**[categorical imperative]{.underline}**, [and an]{.underline}
**["invasive happiness" AI]{.underline}**, [which would]{.underline}
want to [build a paradise for **everyone**]{.underline}.

[If]{.underline} **[two or more]{.underline}** [AIs aimed to bring
happiness to humans]{.underline}, [they could have a
**conflict**]{.underline} [or even a]{.underline} **[war]{.underline}**
[about how it could be done]{.underline}. The Machine Intelligence
Research Institute (MIRI) (LaVictoire et al. 2014) thinks that such
agents could present their source code to each other and use it to
create a united utility function. However, [source code could be
**faked**]{.underline}, [and predicting the interactions of multiple
superintelligences is]{.underline} **[even more
complicated]{.underline}** [than for one superintelligence]{.underline}.

### AT: Limited Goals\-\--2NC

#### If the AI [ever determines]{.underline} humanity to be in the way of their goals, we're [dead]{.underline}.

Alexey **Turchin &** David **Denkenberger 20**, Turchin is a Senior
Researcher at the Science for Life Extension Foundation, Denkenberger is

In this case, [the AI]{.underline}-singleton [does not act]{.underline}
**[against humans]{.underline}**, but moves its actions somewhere else,
probably into space. However, [it must]{.underline}
**[ensure]{.underline}** [that humans will not create another
AI]{.underline}, [or anything else that is a **threat**]{.underline} [to
the first AI]{.underline}, so even if it leaves Earth, [it
would]{.underline} probably [leave behind some form of]{.underline}
"**[AI nanny]{.underline}**," [which would]{.underline}
**[prevent]{.underline}** [humans from creating new AIs or space
weaponry]{.underline}. This may not appear to be an extinction event in
the beginning, merely a reduction of human potential, or "shriek" in
Bostrom's existential risk terminology (Bostrom 2002). Humanity would
lose a potentially bright cosmic future, but live a life similar to our
current one.

However, [as such an AI]{.underline} **[continues]{.underline}**
[its]{.underline} space [exploration]{.underline} and probable
astro-engineering, [it]{.underline} **[might not]{.underline}** [be
interested in anything that happens on]{.underline}
**[Earth]{.underline}**. Therefore, [Earth could suffer
from]{.underline} **[catastrophic consequences]{.underline}** [of
these]{.underline} megascale [engineering projects]{.underline}. For
example, the [AI could build a]{.underline} **[Dyson
sphere]{.underline}** [around the Sun]{.underline}, [shading the
Earth]{.underline}.

Alternatively, [the AI could expose the Earth to]{.underline}
**[dangerous levels]{.underline}** [of radioactivity in the exhaust from
the AI's]{.underline} **[starships]{.underline}**.

[If humans attempted to create a second AI or use space weapons
to]{.underline} **[destroy]{.underline}** [a Dyson sphere]{.underline},
[the]{.underline} **[indifferent singleton]{.underline}**
[would]{.underline} **[stop being indifferent]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} probably **[sterilize Earth]{.underline}**. [AI might
**extirpate humans in advance**]{.underline} [if it thinks that humanity
could pose **even the smallest threat**]{.underline} [to its future
plans]{.underline}. A possible prevention strategy is based on the idea
of persuading AI that preserving humanity has a small positive utility
for it.

[Even if the AI]{.underline} **[completely left]{.underline}** [the
Solar System]{.underline}, [if it prevented humans from creating a
second AI and grounded us on Earth]{.underline}, the [consequences
would]{.underline} no**[t be limited]{.underline}** [to the loss of
future space travel]{.underline}. Additional [consequences may be of
the]{.underline} **[extinction variety]{.underline}**, as [humans
**would not be able**]{.underline} [to use AI systems to control
any]{.underline} other **[global catastrophic risks]{.underline}**, most
importantly the risks of uncontrolled use of synthetic biology (Turchin
et al. 2017). In another example, if [humans were grounded on Earth we
would not be able to build an effective anti-asteroid
defense]{.underline}.

[Human bodies consist of]{.underline} **[organic matter]{.underline}**,
[which could be a source of]{.underline} easy **[energy]{.underline}**
[by oxidation]{.underline}. As R. Freitas wrote, [an army
of]{.underline} **[self-replicating nanobots]{.underline}** [could
use]{.underline} **[all components]{.underline}** [of the biosphere as
**fuel**]{.underline} [as well as **building material**]{.underline}
(Freitas 2000). More [advanced AI may use the]{.underline} **[Earth's
surface]{.underline}** [to build]{.underline} an initial space
exploration [infrastructure]{.underline} (e.g., swarms of chemical
rockets or railguns), **[destroying]{.underline}** [human habitats and
**spoiling**]{.underline} [the atmosphere in the process]{.underline}.

Since there are many reasons that [keeping humans alive
could]{.underline} **[benefit]{.underline}** an **[AGI]{.underline}**,
direct killing of humans for their atoms is less likely than was
previously thought. Still, the [AGI may see humans **as a
threat**]{.underline}, and [fully preserving human ways of life would be
**more expensive**]{.underline} [to the AGI]{.underline}, e.g.,
preserving the whole of planet Earth. [AI could use the material from
the Earth to construct a **Dyson sphere**]{.underline} [or]{.underline}
**[Matrioshka brain]{.underline}** (Bradbury 2001), [convert the whole
planet into]{.underline} **[computronium]{.underline}** (Gildert 2011),
[or cover the entire surface with]{.underline} **[photovoltaic
cells]{.underline}**.

[The]{.underline} **[more advanced]{.underline}** [an AI]{.underline} in
space [became]{.underline}, [the]{.underline} **[less]{.underline}** [it
would depend on Earth as a source of material]{.underline}, [but it
might need materials from the Earth in order to **leave the Solar
System**]{.underline}. Earth is one of the best sources for many
chemical elements in the Solar System and its mass is around half that
of all other terrestrial planets combined. [Because of the **complex
geology** of Earth]{.underline}, [which includes]{.underline}
**[water]{.underline}**, **[life]{.underline}**,
**[volcanism]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[plate
tectonics]{.underline}**, **[concentrated deposits]{.underline}**
[of]{.underline} many otherwise **[rare elements]{.underline}** [have
been produced]{.underline}. Asteroid mining is good only for some
elements, like gold, but not for all (Bardi 2008). So,
[large-scale]{.underline} space [engineering in the Solar System might
require]{.underline} **[dismantling the Earth]{.underline}** [for its
chemicals]{.underline}.

### AT: Counter-AI\-\--2NC

The [risks of war]{.underline} **[between superintelligent
AIs]{.underline}** [seems]{.underline} **[under-explored]{.underline}**,
as [most in the AI safety community assume that there will be a hard
takeoff]{.underline} (Yudkowsky and Hanson 2008), and as a result,
**[only one AI will exist]{.underline}**.

Alternatively, some in the community believe that multiple AIs will be
very effective in collaboration and negotiation (Critch 2017) and will
merge into one AI. [It is clear that]{.underline} human **[extinction is
possible]{.underline}** [if two or more AIs]{.underline} **[wage war
between each other]{.underline}** on Earth.

Bostrom and Yudkowsky wrote that **[very quick]{.underline}**
[self-improvement of the first AI is]{.underline} most likely, [with
a]{.underline} **[rather large lag]{.underline}** [between the
first]{.underline} team which creates AI [and other]{.underline} teams
(Yudkowsky 2008; Bostrom 2014). However, [if]{.underline} **[at least
one]{.underline}** [of these conditions is not true]{.underline}, [there
will be]{.underline} **[many AIs]{.underline}** [undergoing]{.underline}
**[simultaneous hard takeoff]{.underline}**.

[If there are]{.underline} **[multiple AIs]{.underline}**, [they
will]{.underline} likely **[either]{.underline}** peacefully [share the
world]{.underline}, [or]{.underline} **[wage war]{.underline}** [until
one]{.underline} or a small group of AIs [form a singleton]{.underline}.
[The forms of such AI wars may differ]{.underline}; they [could be
a]{.underline} **[cyber war]{.underline}**, **[economic
war]{.underline}** [of attrition]{.underline}, **[hot
war]{.underline}**, [etc]{.underline}. The type of war will mostly
depend on complex game theory and could change from one form to another
if the change provides benefit to one of the sides. [A hot war would
be]{.underline} **[most dangerous]{.underline}** [for
humans]{.underline}, [because its]{.underline} **[indirect
consequences]{.underline}** could [affect the]{.underline} **[entire
surface]{.underline}** [of the Earth and]{.underline} **[all human
beings]{.underline}**, [in the **same way** that nuclear
war]{.underline} between superpowers would [create]{.underline}
**[global risks]{.underline}** for other countries: **[nuclear
winter]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[fallout]{.underline}**.

[AIs at war]{.underline} may [use]{.underline} **[humans]{.underline}**
and human values [for blackmail]{.underline}. For example, [non-friendly
AI]{.underline} may **[blackmail]{.underline}** [friendly AI with
threats to release]{.underline} a **[biological virus]{.underline}**
[that will kill all humans]{.underline}. Thus, [the fact
that]{.underline} **[one of the AIs]{.underline}** [placed value on
human wellbeing could make our population]{.underline} **[vulnerable to
attack]{.underline}** [from an otherwise]{.underline} **[indifferent
opposing AI]{.underline}**. Even if there are two supposedly
human-friendly and beneficial AIs, their [understanding of "good" and
the ways to reach it may be]{.underline} **[incompatible]{.underline}**.
[Historical examples include wars]{.underline} **[between Christian
countries]{.underline}** (Reformation).

### AT: We'll Contain The AI\-\--2NC

However, it \[**[AI]{.underline}**\] still [can give]{.underline} **[bad
advice]{.underline}** [or use]{.underline} other thin **[information
channels]{.underline}** (e.g., text interfaces) [to]{.underline}
**[create damage]{.underline}** outside [and]{.underline}
**[increase]{.underline}** [its]{.underline} own [chances of
freedom]{.underline}. For example, an oracle [AI may be limited to
giving **short text advice** via a **very simple
interface**]{.underline}. [But such advice]{.underline},
[while]{.underline} **[seemingly beneficial]{.underline}** to humans,
[may have]{.underline} **[subtle remote consequences]{.underline}**,
[resulting in the]{.underline} **[liberation of]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline} an **[increase in]{.underline}**, [the]{.underline}
**[power]{.underline}** [of the]{.underline} oracle [AI]{.underline}
(Bostrom 2014).

Stanislav Lem wrote about the risks of oracle AI in his book \"Summa
Technologia\" (Lem 1963). Such [AI may give advice that]{.underline}
**[appears to be good]{.underline}** [in the short term]{.underline},
[but its]{.underline} **[long-term]{.underline}** [consequences could be
**catastrophic**]{.underline}. In Lem\'s example, [the]{.underline}
oracle [AI advises humans to use a **specific**]{.underline} [type of
toothpaste and]{.underline}, separately, [a]{.underline}
**[specific]{.underline}** [type of anti-baldness
treatment]{.underline}. [These activate two genes]{.underline}, [which
are dangerous]{.underline} **[only in combination]{.underline}**.
Moreover, [the AI]{.underline} **[did not]{.underline}** [do it because
it had]{.underline} **[malevolent intent]{.underline}** to exterminate
humanity, [but because it]{.underline} just [searched for
the]{.underline} **[best solution]{.underline}** [for a given
goal]{.underline} among many options. However, [the goal that humans
gave to the AI]{.underline} in Lem\'s example is dangerous: **[stop
population increase]{.underline}**.

[AI could stage a]{.underline} **[global catastrophe]{.underline}**
[of]{.underline} **[any scale]{.underline}** [to facilitate
its]{.underline} initial [breakout]{.underline} from its creators. For
example, [it could stage a]{.underline} **[nuclear war]{.underline}**,
[so that its operators release it]{.underline} into the wild, [hoping
that it will help them in the war]{.underline}. [The AI
could]{.underline} then [create a]{.underline} **[global
risk]{.underline}** [and demand]{.underline} **[full
power]{.underline}**, rightfully claiming that only it could prevent the
risk. [An AI may also]{.underline} **[falsely predict]{.underline}** [an
impeding risk and **demand to be released**]{.underline} [from
confinement]{.underline} in order [to prevent the risk]{.underline}.

4.3. AI risks after it leaves initial confinement but before it takes
over the world

[The]{.underline} **[natural strategy]{.underline}** [for
AI]{.underline} after leaving its initial confinement [would be to hide
somewhere in order to]{.underline} **[self-improve]{.underline}**,
**[acquire robotic infrastructure]{.underline}**, [and other
resources]{.underline} (Yudkowsky 2008). Then it would be equipped
[to]{.underline} **[overcome existing defenses]{.underline}**.

Basically, [AI has]{.underline} **[two types of enemies]{.underline}**:
**[humans]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[other AIs]{.underline}**.
[Humans would]{.underline} probably [search for the]{.underline} leaked
[AI and try to stop it]{.underline}, [using]{.underline} **[all
available means]{.underline}**, [like]{.underline} **[shutting down the
Internet]{.underline}**, **[globally turning off
electricity]{.underline}**, **[or even nuclear strikes]{.underline}**.
[But if the AI is able to escape]{.underline} from its human creators,
[it will]{.underline} probably **[be prepared]{.underline}** [to deal
with these]{.underline} **[human actions]{.underline}**.

The second risk is other AIs. [The owners of the first AI will still
probably have the AI's source code]{.underline}, so [the owners could
make a copy of the original AI with the goal of **finding and
stopping**]{.underline} [the first runaway AI]{.underline}. This is the
most immediate risk for the first AI. [Such a second AI may
be]{.underline} **[as powerful]{.underline}** [as the first]{.underline}
AI, and this [could be a route to]{.underline} **[AI war]{.underline}**.

Elsewhere, we have shown that an AI that collaborates with its owners
will have an advantage (Turchin and Denkenberger 2017), since it would
not need to spend resources on hiding and fighting. Thus, a hard takeoff
is more probable from a collaborating AI. It could collaborate up until
the very late stages and still make the treacherous turn when it is a
full-grown superintelligence with a large infrastructure.

Other AIs could be created by other AI teams. There are 2700 narrow AI
related startups in the world as of 2017 (Angel.co 2017). The number of
AGI projects is not so easy to estimate, as many are personal, secret,
in universities, or may come from very effective narrow AI projects.
There are around ten main players (like Google), around 100 groups of
people or startups dedicated to creating AGI, and probably thousands of
individuals. Some data reported by Meuhlhauser (2014) are now obsolete,
as the field has grown rapidly in recent years.

We estimate the number of AGI teams as an order of magnitude of 100,
that they are all within two years of each other, and that they are
distributed linearly in their success timing. Therefore, the median
distance between multiple AGI fruition would be approximately seven
days. The self-improvement process is difficult because it requires
testing of the new versions of the AI (Turchin and Denkenberger 2017),
so seven days may not be enough time to gain a decisive advantage. In
that case, multiple simultaneous takeoffs will happen, and the dynamic
will be highly chaotic. Even if there are two strongest competitors,
they could come to fruition almost simultaneously. The historical
examples of the telephone patent (Baker 2000) and returning samples from
the Moon (The Telegraph 2009) show that the scale of such a difference
could be mere hours. The reason for small timing differences is that the
first mover provokes the other side to launch their own system, even if
it is not fully ready.

[Thus]{.underline}, [the first AI will **not have**]{.underline} much
[time to hide]{.underline}. [Its]{.underline} **[convergent
goal]{.underline}** [will be to prevent]{.underline} the appearance of
**[other AIs]{.underline}** [in many places]{.underline}; [staging
a]{.underline} **[global catastrophe]{.underline}** [may be
the]{.underline} **[most effective way]{.underline}** [to do
so]{.underline}. As [the young AI is]{.underline} **[not
superintelligent]{.underline}** [and is]{.underline} also **[time
constrained]{.underline}**, it cannot spend much time on finding the
best and most elegant route. [It would]{.underline} probably
[elect]{.underline} **[simpler]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[more
brutal]{.underline}** [routes]{.underline}.

[From a]{.underline} **[technical]{.underline}** [point of
view]{.underline}, a hiding young [AI can use]{.underline} only
relatively **[simple means]{.underline}** [to stage a global
catastrophe]{.underline}, that is, to **[provoke nuclear
war]{.underline}**, [create a]{.underline} rather simple
**[bioweapon]{.underline}** [or a]{.underline} **[narrow AI
virus]{.underline}** to affect many existing robotics or other systems.
[If it creates **more sophisticated technology**]{.underline}
[like]{.underline} its own **[nanomachines]{.underline}**, [it
would]{.underline} probably be able to **[take over the
world]{.underline}** without killing anyone. The risks of such a
takeover are discussed in the next section.

4.4. [AI]{.underline} **[enslaves humans]{.underline}** [during the
process of becoming a singleton]{.underline}

[Humans may be]{.underline} instrumentally [useful for]{.underline} the
[young AI before it reaches omnipotence]{.underline}. [It may need
humans]{.underline}, **[not just]{.underline}** [as a source of
atoms]{.underline}, [but as]{.underline} some kind of
**[slaves]{.underline}**. [The AI could create a]{.underline}
**[brain-infecting virus]{.underline}** [that **converts**]{.underline}
the [humans into slaves]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} also
**[permanently damages]{.underline}** [their autonomy]{.underline}. This
period may not last for long, as the AI would soon master nanotechnology
and could go forward without humans. It also would not need to enslave
all humans but perhaps only a few in order to form the required
infrastructure. [While slavery appears to be a type of **survival
option**]{.underline} [for humans]{.underline}, [it is]{.underline}
obviously **[not optimal]{.underline}**.

4.5. AI **[blackmails humans]{.underline}** [with the]{.underline}
**[threat of extinction]{.underline}** [to achieve
dominance]{.underline}

Herman Khan put forward the idea that [an adversary could create
a]{.underline} **[Doomsday weapon]{.underline}** [for the purpose
of]{.underline} **[global blackmail]{.underline}** (Kahn 1959). While
[no known Doomsday devices were built]{.underline}, such [a device would
be an]{.underline} **[embodiment]{.underline}** of the doctrine [of
mutually assured destruction]{.underline} associated [with]{.underline}
**[full-scale nuclear retaliation]{.underline}**.

A [young AI may create]{.underline} **[Doomsday weapons]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} use them to **[blackmail humanity]{.underline}** in
order [to secure world domination]{.underline}. **[Even]{.underline}**
[a]{.underline} **[benevolent]{.underline}** utilitarian [AI may resort
to blackmail if it calculates that the **expected utility**]{.underline}
[of]{.underline} its **[victory]{.underline}** [is greater than the
expected loss of utility associated with]{.underline} human
**[extinction]{.underline}** (Shulman 2010). Even if the AI has to use
its blackmail weapon to exterminate humans in 99% of cases, it could
still be positive from the point of view of its utility function. [Such
situations with]{.underline} **[unbounded utilities]{.underline}** [may
be regarded as]{.underline} **[special cases]{.underline}** of the
failure of friendliness, which will be discussed later.

[There are a]{.underline} **[number]{.underline}** \[[of]{.underline}\]
[GCRs associated with military systems]{.underline}. Some potential
scenarios: **[military robotics]{.underline}** [could
become]{.underline} **[so cheap]{.underline}** [that]{.underline}
**[drone swarms]{.underline}** could [cause]{.underline} **[enormous
damage]{.underline}** [to the human population]{.underline}; [a large
autonomous army could attack humans because of a]{.underline} **[command
error]{.underline}**; **[billions of nanobots]{.underline}** [with
narrow AI could be created in a **terrorist attack**]{.underline} [and
create a]{.underline} **[global catastrophe]{.underline}** (Freitas
2000).

In 2017, [global attention was attracted to a viral video
about]{.underline} **["slaughterbots"]{.underline}** (Oberhaus 2017),
[hypothetical small drones able to **recognize humans**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} **[kill them with explosives]{.underline}**. While
such a scenario is unlikely to pose a GCR, [a
**combination**]{.underline} [of]{.underline} **[cheap AI-powered drone
manufacture]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[high-precision]{.underline}** AI-powered [targeting could
convert]{.underline} **[clouds of drones]{.underline}**
[into]{.underline} weapons of mass destruction
\[**[WMDs]{.underline}**\]. [This could create]{.underline} a **["drone
swarms" arms race]{.underline}**, [similar to the nuclear
race]{.underline}. [Such a race might result in an]{.underline}
**[accidental global war]{.underline}**, [in which]{.underline} two or
more [sides]{.underline} **[attack each other]{.underline}** [with
clouds of]{.underline} small **[killer drones]{.underline}**. It is more
likely that [drones of this type would contribute to]{.underline}
**[global instability]{.underline}** rather than cause a purely
drone-based catastrophe.

AI-controlled drones could be delivered large distances by a larger
vehicle, or they could be solar powered; solar-powered airplanes already
exist (Taylor 2017). Some advanced forms of air defense will limit this
risk, but [drones could also]{.underline} **[jump]{.underline}** (e.g.,
solar charging interspersed with short flights),
**[crawl]{.underline}**, [or]{.underline} even **[move
underground]{.underline}** [like worms]{.underline}. [There
are]{.underline} **[fewer barriers]{.underline}** [to drone war
escalation than to nuclear weapons]{.underline}. [Drones
could]{.underline} **[also]{.underline}** [be used
**anonymously**]{.underline}, [which might **encourage** their use under
a]{.underline} **[false flag]{.underline}**. Killer drones could also be
used to **[suppress political dissent]{.underline}**, perhaps
[creating]{.underline} **[global totalitarianism]{.underline}**. Other

A [narrow AI virus may]{.underline} also [affect]{.underline}
**[civilian infrastructure]{.underline}**; some, but not all ways in
which this could be possible are listed below. Remember that [in the
case of]{.underline} **[global catastrophes]{.underline}**, the
[conditions necessary for most catastrophes]{.underline} could
[exist]{.underline} **[simultaneously]{.underline}**. Several
distinctive scenarios of such a catastrophe have been suggested.

For example, [autopilot-controlled and hacked planes]{.underline} could
**[crash]{.underline}** [into]{.underline} **[nuclear power
stations]{.underline}**. [There are]{.underline} around 1000 nuclear
facilities in the world, and **[thousands]{.underline}**
[of]{.underline} large [planes are in the air at]{.underline} **[every
moment]{.underline}**---**[most of them have computerized
autopilots]{.underline}**. Coordinated plane attacks happened in 2001
and a plane has been hacked (Futureworld 2013). [Self-driving cars
could]{.underline} **[hunt people]{.underline}**, and it is projected
that most new cars after 2030 will have some self- driving capabilities
(Anderson 2017).

Elon Musk has spoken about the risks of [AI living in the
Internet]{.underline}; it [could]{.underline} **[start
wars]{.underline}** [by]{.underline} **[manipulating fake
news]{.underline}** (Wootson 2017). [Computer viruses could
also]{.underline} **[manipulate human behavior]{.underline}** [using
blackmail]{.underline}, as seen in fiction in an episode of Black Mirror
(Watkins 2016). Another example is [creating]{.underline} suicide
**[ideation]{.underline}**, [e.g.]{.underline}, the recent internet
suicide game in Russia, ["Blue Whale"]{.underline} (Mullin 2017), which
allegedly killed 130 teenagers by sending them tasks of increasing
complexity and finally requesting their suicide.

The [IoT will make]{.underline} **[home infrastructure]{.underline}**
[vulnerable]{.underline} (Granoff 2016). Home [electrical systems
could]{.underline} have **[short circuits]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[start fires]{.underline}**; phones could also catch
fire. Other scenarios are also possible: [home robots]{.underline},
which may become popular in the next few decades, [could]{.underline}
start to **[attack people]{.underline}**; [infected
factories]{.underline} could [produce]{.underline} **[toxic
chemicals]{.underline}** [after being hacked by viruses]{.underline}.

**[Large-scale infrastructure failure]{.underline}** may [result in
the]{.underline} **[collapse of technological
civilization]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[famine]{.underline}**
(Hanson 2008; Cole et al. 2016). [As industries become]{.underline}
**[increasingly computerized]{.underline}**, [they will]{.underline}
**[completely depend]{.underline}** [on]{.underline} proper functioning
of [computers]{.underline}, while in the past they could continue
without them. These [industries include]{.underline} **[power
generation]{.underline}**, **[transport]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline} **[food production]{.underline}**. As the trend
continues, [turning off computers will leave humans]{.underline}
**[without food]{.underline}**, **[heating]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline} **[medication]{.underline}**. Many [industries
become]{.underline} **[dangerous]{.underline}** [if their facilities are
not]{.underline} **[intensively maintained]{.underline}**,
[including]{.underline} **[nuclear plants]{.underline}**, **[spent
nuclear fuel storage systems]{.underline}**, **[weapons
systems]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} **[water dams]{.underline}**.
If one compares [human civilization]{.underline} with a multicellular
organism, one could see that multicellular organisms [could
die]{.underline} **[completely]{.underline}**, down to the last cell,
[as the result of a]{.underline} **[very small
intervention]{.underline}**. [As]{.underline}
**[interconnectedness]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[computerization]{.underline}** [of the human civilization
grow]{.underline}, [we become]{.underline} **[more and more
vulnerable]{.underline}** [to]{.underline} information-based
[attacks]{.underline}.

[There is **also**]{.underline} [a group of scenarios in
which]{.underline} narrow [AI]{.underline} and robotization [affect
human society in such a way that the human population]{.underline}
**[gradually declines]{.underline}**, the role of humans diminishes,
[and]{.underline} **[human values]{.underline}** [are]{.underline}
**[eroded]{.underline}** (Joy 2000). This may not directly kill all
humans in the short term, but could put them in the situation of
"endangered species" in \~100 years. This could happen if no
superintelligent AI appears, or if the appearance of superintelligent AI
is not revolutionary. [One example is the use of cyber warfare to
affect]{.underline} **[elections]{.underline}** (e.g., the 2016 US
election), [which]{.underline} may [produce]{.underline} **[civil

An [automated economy could]{.underline} purposelessly
[exist]{.underline} even **[without humans]{.underline}**, [like
the]{.underline} ***[Ascending Economy]{.underline}*** described by
(Alexander 2016). [Such a scenario could be an example of]{.underline}
bad distributed (and non-agential) [superintelligence created by market

[Such]{.underline} a [superintelligence could]{.underline}
**[gradually]{.underline}** [push humans]{.underline} **[out of

3.4.2. Gradual replacement of humans by robots

[From an]{.underline} **[evolutionary]{.underline}** [point of

**[not]{.underline}** [direct killing]{.underline} of its

It is conceivable that [human-level AGI will be created]{.underline},
perhaps [by]{.underline} the **[mind uploading]{.underline}** method
(Hanson 2016), but creation of superhuman AI will be postponed because
of technical difficulties, or due to a permanent ban.

Many of [the risks of human-level AI will be similar to the risks of
narrow AI mentioned above]{.underline}, [including]{.underline}
**[sophisticated AI viruses]{.underline}**, **[acceleration of dangerous
science]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} **[human replacement by the
robotic economy]{.underline}**. [One]{.underline} **[specific
risk]{.underline}** [is that human uploads will be]{.underline}
philosophical zombies (**[p-zombies]{.underline}**). In that case, if
everybody was uploaded, [the world would]{.underline}
**[appear]{.underline}** [to be enjoyable]{.underline}, full of robots
and virtual reality. [But there would be]{.underline} **[no subjective
experiences]{.underline}** at all [and the world would]{.underline}, in
fact, [be]{.underline} **[subjectively dead]{.underline}**. This risk
appears to be low, as many claim that p-zombies are impossible (Dennett
1978; Yudkowsky 2015). There could be other risks of this type, even
subtler.

For example, human uploads could have a slightly different set of
subjective experiences, values or behavior.

Christiano suggested "**[prosaic AI]{.underline}**," which is some
combination of already existing technologies, mainly neural nets
(Christiano 2016). Such a system would have limited ability to
self-improve, but [could]{.underline} still [be]{.underline}
**[dangerous]{.underline}** [if it works as a "global brain" or a
weapon]{.underline}. One possibility is an AI system which has a model
of itself and a survival drive but does not self-improve for some
reason. Another possibility is a very large AI system which merges with
government structures but does not need to self-improve to reach its
goals. [This could become the basis of a]{.underline} **[repressive
totalitarian state]{.underline}** [which]{.underline} ultimately **[does
not need humans]{.underline}**, as discussed in Section 3.2.1.

**[Narrow AI]{.underline}** may be [used as a weapon]{.underline}, which
[could provide a]{.underline} **[decisive advantage]{.underline}** even

[While]{.underline} artificial intelligence (**[AI]{.underline}**) [is
on the cusp of]{.underline} driving what some refer to as [the
**next**]{.underline} "**[agricultural revolution]{.underline}**",
[researchers are]{.underline} **[warning]{.underline}**
[that]{.underline} using some of these [new technologies]{.underline} at
scale [holds]{.underline} **[huge risks]{.underline}** [that
are]{.underline} **[not being considered]{.underline}**.

**[Even still]{.underline}**, many [industry watchers believe these
systems are]{.underline} **[pivotal]{.underline}** [in confronting
the]{.underline} global challenge of feeding our **[ballooning
populations]{.underline}** more sustainably.

[A **new risk analysis**]{.underline}, published in the journal Nature
Machine Intelligence, [warns that the]{.underline} future [use
of]{.underline} artificial intelligence \[**[AI]{.underline}**\] [in
agriculture comes with]{.underline} "**[substantial potential
risks]{.underline}**" [for]{.underline} **[farms]{.underline}**,
**[farmers]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[food
security]{.underline}** [that are]{.underline} **[poorly
understood]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[under-appreciated]{.underline}**.

"The idea of intelligent machines running farms is not science fiction.
Large companies are already pioneering the next generation of autonomous
ag-bots and decision support systems that will replace humans in the
field," highlights Dr. Asaf Tzachor at the University of Cambridge's
Centre for the Study of Existential Risk, first author of the paper.

"But so far [no-one seems to have asked the question]{.underline} '[are
there]{.underline} any [risks associated with a]{.underline} **[rapid
deployment]{.underline}** [of **agricultural AI?**]{.underline}'"

Risk of hacking a food network

The [researchers put forward]{.underline} a **[hypothetical
scenario]{.underline}** [in which the authority for]{.underline}
**[tilling]{.underline}**, **[planting]{.underline}**,
**[fertilizing]{.underline}**, **[monitoring]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[harvesting]{.underline}** this field [has been
delegated to AI]{.underline}.

In this scenario, these algorithms that control drip-irrigation systems,
self-driving tractors and combine harvesters are clever enough to
respond to the weather and the exact needs of the crop.

These intelligent automated systems would be largely responsible for
managing large expanses of crops, being grown for food to feed entire
cities' worth of people.

"**[Then imagine a hacker]{.underline}** messing things up," [the
paper's authors stress]{.underline}

"[Despite]{.underline} the **[huge promise]{.underline}** [of AI for
**improving crop management**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[agricultural productivity]{.underline}**, [potential
risks]{.underline} **[must be addressed]{.underline}** responsibly and
new technologies properly tested in experimental settings to ensure they
are safe, [while]{.underline} **[securing]{.underline}** [against
**accidental failures**]{.underline}, **[unintended
consequences]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[cyber-attacks]{.underline}**."

Employing white hats to identify system failures

In their research, the [authors]{.underline} have [come up with
a]{.underline} **[catalog of risks]{.underline}** [that must be
considered in the responsible development of AI for
agriculture]{.underline} -- and ways to address them.

In this assessment, they [raise the alarm about]{.underline}
**[cyber-attackers]{.underline}** potentially [causing]{.underline}
**[disruption]{.underline}** [to commercial farms using AI]{.underline},
[by]{.underline} **[poisoning datasets]{.underline}** [or]{.underline}
by **[shutting down]{.underline}** [sprayers]{.underline}, [autonomous
drones and robotic harvesters]{.underline}.

To guard against this they suggest that "white hat hackers" help
companies uncover any security failings during the development phase, so
that systems can be safeguarded against real hackers.

In a scenario associated with accidental failure, the authors suggest
that an [AI system programmed]{.underline} only [to deliver
the]{.underline} **[best crop yield]{.underline}** in the short term
[might]{.underline} **[ignore]{.underline}** the **[environmental
consequences]{.underline}** of achieving this, [leading to]{.underline}
**[overuse of fertilizers]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[soil
erosion]{.underline}** in the long-term.

Meanwhile, [the]{.underline} **[over-application]{.underline}** of
pesticides [in pursuit of]{.underline} **[high yields]{.underline}**
[could]{.underline} **[poison ecosystems]{.underline}**; while
over-application of nitrogen fertilizer would **[pollute]{.underline}**
[the soil and surrounding waterways]{.underline}.

While AI may help relieve manual labor, it may widen the gaps between
commercial and subsistence farmers, the researchers flag.

The authors suggest involving applied ecologists in the technology
design process to ensure these scenarios are avoided.

Impact on human labor

Aside from raising farming efficiencies, autonomous AI machine systems
can also help improve the working conditions of farmers, relieving them
of manual labor.

But [without]{.underline} **[inclusive technology design]{.underline}**,
**[socioeconomic inequalities]{.underline}** that are currently
[entrenched in global agriculture]{.underline} --
[including]{.underline} **[gender]{.underline}**,
**[class]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[ethnic
discriminations]{.underline}** -- [will]{.underline}
**[remain]{.underline}**.

"Expert [AI farming systems that]{.underline} **[don't
consider]{.underline}** the [complexities of labor inputs will
**ignore**]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} potentially
**[sustain]{.underline}**, the **[exploitation]{.underline}** [of
disadvantaged communities]{.underline}," warns Tzachor.

However, **[small-scale growers]{.underline}** [who cultivate
the]{.underline} **[majority of farms]{.underline}** worldwide [and
feed]{.underline} **[large swaths]{.underline}** [of the so-called
Global South are likely to be]{.underline} **[excluded]{.underline}**
[from]{.underline} **[AI-related benefits]{.underline}**.

"**[Marginalization]{.underline}**, **[poor internet]{.underline}**
penetration rates, [and the]{.underline} **[digital
divide]{.underline}** might [prevent]{.underline}
**[smallholders]{.underline}** [from using advanced
technologies]{.underline}, **[widening the gaps]{.underline}** [between
**commercial**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[subsistence]{.underline}** [farmers]{.underline}," warn the
researchers.

artificial intelligence (**[AI]{.underline}**). At a time when about 9
in 10 U.S. adults consider China to be a "competitor" or "enemy," [calls
for Washington and Beijing to cooperate]{.underline} on shared
challenges **[routinely]{.underline}** [fall on deaf ears]{.underline}.
But, [as laboratories in]{.underline} **[both countries]{.underline}**
[continue to unveil]{.underline} **[dramatic capabilities]{.underline}**
[for AI systems]{.underline}, [it is]{.underline} **[more important than
ever]{.underline}** [that the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [and]{.underline} China take steps to mitigate
existential threats posed by AI accidents.

As a technology, [AI is]{.underline} **[profoundly
fragile]{.underline}**. [Even with]{.underline} **[perfect
information]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[ideal operating
circumstances]{.underline}**, [machine learning systems]{.underline}
**[break easily]{.underline}** [and perform in ways]{.underline}
**[contrary]{.underline}** [to their intended function]{.underline}.
Since 2017, the Global Partnership on AI has logged "more than 1,200
reports of intelligent systems causing safety, fairness, or other
real-world problems," from autonomous car accidents to racially biased
hiring decisions. [When the stakes are low]{.underline}, the [risk of an
AI accident can be tolerable]{.underline}---such as being presented with
an uninteresting Netflix recommendation or suboptimal driving route.
[But in a]{.underline} **[high-pressure]{.underline}**,
**[low-information]{.underline}** [military environment]{.underline},
both [the]{.underline} **[probability]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[consequences]{.underline}** [of AI accidents are]{.underline}
**[bound to increase]{.underline}**.

Weapon [systems]{.underline} put [at high alert]{.underline}, for
instance, [could mistake a routine incident for an
attack]{.underline}---[and]{.underline} even **[automatically
respond]{.underline}**. Some of [the Cold War's **most
dangerous**]{.underline} [nuclear warning malfunctions were]{.underline}
**[narrowly avoided]{.underline}** [because]{.underline} **[human
judgment]{.underline}** [prevailed]{.underline}. For now, [nuclear
command and control systems]{.underline} in the United States and China
**[still require]{.underline}** that element of [human
decision-making]{.underline}---but, for instance, shipboard defense
systems that might be involved in naval confrontations do not.

**[Neither side]{.underline}** [trusts the other on this
issue]{.underline}. Over the past six months, I have spoken on a handful
of occasions with [retired Chinese military leaders about]{.underline}
the [risks involved with AI systems]{.underline}. They [view
the]{.underline} U.S. [Defense Department's AI ethics principles and
broader approach to]{.underline} "responsible [AI]{.underline}"
[as]{.underline} **[bad-faith]{.underline}** [efforts to]{.underline}
**[skirt]{.underline}** [multilateral negotiations aimed at
restricting]{.underline} the development of [autonomous
weapons]{.underline}. Meanwhile, [U.S. observers]{.underline} **[don't
believe]{.underline}** [China is serious about]{.underline} those
[negotiations]{.underline}, [given its extraordinarily narrow definition
of lethal autonomous weapons systems]{.underline}. (China has called for
a ban only on autonomous weapons that cannot be recalled once initiated
and which kill with indiscriminate effect.) **[Both
militaries]{.underline}** [are developing]{.underline} automated [target

last substantial discussion among the United Nations Group of

[Disinformation operations]{.underline} --- covert efforts to

have **[historically]{.underline}** [been a]{.underline} distinctively
**[human endeavor]{.underline}**. [With the rise of]{.underline}

actors]{.underline}** have increasingly [exploited the machine learning
systems]{.underline} embedded in our daily lives [to]{.underline}
**[precisely target]{.underline}** [audiences]{.underline}, **[shape

are]{.underline} **[expanding]{.underline}** their manipulation
[toolkits to include new]{.underline} **[AI techniques]{.underline}**.
AI-generated synthetic media and convincing AI-enhanced chatbots [now
offer threat actors a]{.underline} **[growing array]{.underline}**
[of]{.underline} persuasive, tailored, and difficult-to-detect

[they will]{.underline} likely [remain]{.underline}
**[insufficient]{.underline}** [to counterbalance the]{.underline}
**[expanding universe]{.underline}** [of anonymous digital
mercenaries]{.underline}. Unless liberal democracies develop
whole-of-society counter-disinformation strategies, [AI-enhanced
disinformation operations will]{.underline} **[further
exacerbate]{.underline}** [political polarization]{.underline},
**[erode]{.underline}** citizen [trust in societal
institutions]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} **[blur the
lines]{.underline}** [between truth and lies]{.underline}.

Mapping and Defining the Modern Disinformation Landscape

First, a few quick definitions are in order. AI is a field of research
that seeks to build computing technologies that possess aspects of human
perception, reasoning, and decision-making. Machine learning, a subset
of AI, involves the use of computing power to execute algorithms that
learn from data. Algorithms are the recipe for completing programmed
tasks; data help these systems "learn" about the world; and computing
power is the engine that enables systems to perform specific tasks
quickly and accurately. Over the last decade, [significant improvements
in machine learning capabilities have been enabled by
advances]{.underline} in computer processing power, the rise of Big
Data, [and the evolution of deep learning]{.underline} "neural
[networks]{.underline}." (These networks contain cascades of nodes that
loosely mimic the neurons in the human brain, which, in combination, can
identify patterns in large datasets and encode complex tasks.) While
distinct from human intelligence, AI excels at narrow tasks and has
exceeded human capabilities in several fields.

As non-human intelligence has increasingly been integrated into the
fabric of human activity, [digital]{.underline}
**[disinformation]{.underline}** [has emerged as a]{.underline}
**[potent means]{.underline}** [of political warfare]{.underline}. Large
technology corporations, [driven]{.underline} partly [by the competitive
market for attention and advertising revenue]{.underline}, **[extract
user data]{.underline}** [to refine their content-selection algorithms
and]{.underline} **[optimize]{.underline}** [user
engagement]{.underline}. As outlined in the Facebook papers, at the core
of these influential social networks are recommendation systems that
drive users down rabbit holes of progressively more personalized and
novel content. A [report from Katerina Sedova and her team at the Center
for Security and Emerging Technology]{.underline}
**[illustrates]{.underline}** [how malign actors]{.underline}
**[exploit]{.underline}** [this attention-centric digital environment
to]{.underline} **[micro-target]{.underline}** and mobilize unwitting
[Internet users by **seeding**]{.underline} "the [information
environment with]{.underline} **[tailored content]{.underline}** and
**[hijacking]{.underline}** [legitimate online forums]{.underline}"
through fake human accounts (sock puppets), automated botnets, groups of
coordinated humans, and digital advertising.
[Disinformation]{.underline} operators [seek to]{.underline} **[exploit
human biases]{.underline}**, **[heighten emotions]{.underline}**, [and
induce]{.underline} **[information overload]{.underline}** [at the
expense of rational decision-making]{.underline}. Researchers from
Harvard's Shorenstein Center argue that talented [disinformation
operators can]{.underline} "[enable]{.underline}
**[discriminatory]{.underline}** and inflammatory [ideas to enter public
discourse]{.underline}" as fact by deliberately highlighting differences
and divisions in society. [Over time]{.underline}, [this]{.underline}
phenomenon [can widen]{.underline} **[identity-based
fissures]{.underline}** [between social groups]{.underline}, **[jam the
gears]{.underline}** of **[democratic governance]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline}, in some cases, **[catalyze violence]{.underline}**.

Digital disinformation techniques are diffusing and evolving at a rapid
pace. [Authoritarian regimes]{.underline}, [particularly]{.underline}
**[Russia]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[China]{.underline}**,
increasingly [pursue]{.underline} **[new capabilities]{.underline}** [to
project their disinformation operations]{.underline} **[more
precisely]{.underline}** at home and [abroad]{.underline}. While foreign
disinformation campaigns receive the majority of attention, [domestic
actors are adopting]{.underline} **[similar tactics]{.underline}**, [and
operations are]{.underline} **[increasingly]{.underline}** [being
outsourced to a]{.underline} **[growing]{.underline}** [transnational
disinformation-for-hire industry]{.underline}. Given its proven success
and future potential, well-resourced actors will continue to invest in
advanced AI capabilities to augment their current disinformation
operations.

Democratized Deepfakes and AI-Enhanced Chatbots

[Machine learning techniques can generate]{.underline} **[highly
realistic]{.underline}** fake images, audio, and video known as
"**[deepfakes]{.underline}**." Generative Adversarial Networks
(**[GANs]{.underline}**) [make these synthetic media capabilities
possible]{.underline} --- a technique that [generates]{.underline}
**[new synthetic data]{.underline}** [that becomes]{.underline}
**[increasingly realistic]{.underline}** [as it learns]{.underline}. A
GAN system pits two networks against one another. One network (the
discriminator) is trained on a real dataset of interest and then detects
whether new data is real or fake. The opposing network (the generator)
produces novel data to fool the discriminator. [As a result
of]{.underline} this **[iterative competition]{.underline}**, [the
generator]{.underline} **[improves]{.underline}** [at creating synthetic
content that can be **weaponized** to mislead]{.underline},
[deceive]{.underline}, [or influence audiences]{.underline}. [This
technique has been used to create]{.underline} **[extraordinarily
realistic]{.underline}** [artificial faces]{.underline} for legions of
bot accounts, produce **[convincing audio]{.underline}** [for extortion
or blackmail]{.underline}, [and generate]{.underline} **[fake
content]{.underline}** [that]{.underline}, when timed strategically,
[can]{.underline} **[destabilize governance]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[geopolitics]{.underline}**.

As synthetic media capabilities become more accessible and
user-friendly, [experts predict that deepfakes will benefit
those]{.underline} **[already]{.underline}** [in positions of power and
influence and pose the]{.underline} **[most significant
risks]{.underline}** [to communities]{.underline}
**[antagonistic]{.underline}** [to traditional power
structures]{.underline}. In a world replete with manipulated media,
powerful individuals and institutions can conveniently dismiss
inconvenient facts. [This dynamic may perpetuate]{.underline} what
Robert Chesney and Danielle Citron call [a]{.underline} **["liar's
dividend"]{.underline}** [in which]{.underline} **[bad
actors]{.underline}** caught in genuine recordings of misbehavior
[can]{.underline} **[dismiss the truth]{.underline}** [as]{.underline}
**[AI forgery]{.underline}**. Beyond the individual harms and misdeeds
enabled by this dynamic, [this trend will]{.underline} likely
[accelerate]{.underline} **[growing cynicism]{.underline}** [about the
possibility and value of distinguishing between fact and
fiction]{.underline}. According to a recent report from the United
Nations Institute for Disarmament Research, the ability to "portray
someone doing something they never did or saying something they never
said" through deepfakes could "challenge and influence our perceptions
of reality."

While visual deepfakes have garnered the attention of policymakers,
deepfake text may prove even more vexing. Breakthroughs in natural
language processing and generation --- machine learning algorithms that
recognize, predict, and produce languages --- have given rise to
sophisticated large language models capable of reading, writing, and
interpreting text. As Karen Hao explains in MIT's Technology Review: "By
ingesting millions of web-based sentences, paragraphs, and dialogue,
these models learn the statistical patterns that govern how each element
should be sensibly ordered." But along with grammatical rules, these
models excel at mimicking online discourse and are thus prone to
parroting humanity's most insidious biases.

Capable of writing persuasive and seemingly authentic content that
conforms to a specific cultural milieu, large language models can be
used to increase the scale and scope of disinformation operations. Early
research has found that one model can write articles indistinguishable
from those written by journalists (particularly as the partisanship of
the content increased), emulate the style of extremist writing, produce
racist manifestos from multiple viewpoints, seed new conspiracy
narratives, and draft posts that exploit political wedges. Studies have
also shown that threat actors can use large language models to
streamline the work of human disinformation operators, facilitate
micro-targeted propaganda campaigns, and enhance the explosive potential
when leaking hacked documents.

Despite these hazards, large language models are being developed and
deployed by companies and countries worldwide and are increasingly
open-source. Because there is no technology yet capable of
comprehensively identifying synthetic text online, malign actors may
already be using these models to augment their disinformation
operations. As GANs and large language model capabilities advance,
machine learning models have begun to shift toward the production of
integrated combinations of text, video, audio, and still images, which
will enable human-machine teams to produce high-quality and highly
personalized disinformation-at-scale.

New machine learning techniques also enable the production of automated
social media accounts --- commonly called "bots" --- that are better at
mimicking human behavior, maximizing amplification, and avoiding
detection. Conversational AIs are large language models capable of
managing the "open-ended nature" of conversations, signaling a near
future in which chatbots engage in seamless dialogue with humans. The AI
research community typically makes their findings public, so other
researchers can reproduce, learn, and build on their work. In turn,
open-source training datasets released by bot detection services are
equally available to threat actors who use them to develop more
human-like bots.

These advances enable savvy disinformation operators to combine
AI-powered chatbots with existing social listening and synthetic media
capabilities to identify trending topics, develop a pool of
human-curated messages, and deliver highly personalized narratives to
targeted audiences. It will soon be possible for threat actors to train
chatbots to specialize in specific trolling techniques or bring them to
life with GANs-generated video skins that impersonate trusted sources.
Soon, fully autonomous bot accounts will be produced en masse, improve
rapidly with experience, and ceaselessly try to persuade, troll, and
manipulate people online. As a 2017 report from the State Department's
Advisory Commission on Public Diplomacy predicts, machines will then
process the expanding corpus of bot-generated content, producing a
vicious cycle in which devices will talk to, at, and over each other,
progressively "drowning out human conversations online." It is unclear
to what extent these fears have been realized over the five years since
that report was released -- but claims about the prevalence of bots
currently operating on social media platforms have already thrown a
wrench into the proposed sale of one central platform (Twitter). The
continued inability to determine the extent of Twitter's bot problem,
even with a \$44 billion deal on the line, illustrates the profound
challenge of identifying AI-generated content at scale.

And yet, it seems that the potential deluge of AI-enhanced
disinformation has not drowned out human voices yet. Indeed, by our
current best assessments, during the highly contentious 2020 U.S.
presidential election, there was a notable absence of
politically-motivated deepfake content (with some exceptions). Instead,
the most substantial ongoing damage caused by synthetic media is
happening in the personal sphere, disproportionately impacting women and
marginalized communities. For now, simple editing software and
techniques like attaching misleading descriptions to existing content
are significantly more common than AI-generated synthetic media. As
researchers from the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists point out,
manipulated media does not need to convince their audience of their
realism to spread widely and influence human behavior.

[In the]{.underline} **[high-stakes realm]{.underline}**
[of]{.underline} **[geopolitics]{.underline}**, [authoritarian states
have]{.underline} just [begun]{.underline} **[integrating
deepfakes]{.underline}** [and other AI-enabled media into their
**disinformation toolkits**]{.underline}. For example, in the lead-up to
its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, [the Kremlin]{.underline} reportedly
[planned to]{.underline} **[stage a Ukrainian attack]{.underline}** [on
Russian civilians as a]{.underline} **[pretext for
invading]{.underline}** --- but the plan would have reportedly employed
actors and corpses, not deepfakes. In other words, even well-resourced
threat actors continue to opt for more traditional forms of deception
over AI-generated forgeries. Even when employed, these technologies have
not yet been effective. For instance, a deepfake depicting Ukrainian
President Volodymyr Zelensky surrendering was uploaded to a hacked
Ukrainian news website, but the video was quickly debunked. At the same
time, the Kremlin has also pursued more subtle information warfare
strategies that AI has augmented. For example, [Russia]{.underline} has
[deployed swarms of fake accounts with]{.underline} **[AI-generated
faces]{.underline}** [to **bolster their credibility**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} **[parrot their talking points]{.underline}**.
Overall, the [refinement of synthetic media generation will]{.underline}
**[inevitably augment the disinformation capabilities of malign
actors]{.underline}** [and become an **increasingly
routine**]{.underline} [aspect of]{.underline} online
[life]{.underline}.

Strategies for Combating AI-Enhanced Disinformation

Just as machine learning is used to amplify disinformation operations,
other machine learning capabilities can be used to protect the
information environment. Stakeholders are developing media provenance
technologies to authenticate metadata --- information about how, by
whom, when, and where a piece of media was created and edited. Katarina
Kertysova highlights how AI can identify patterns of words that indicate
disinformation by analyzing cues from articles previously flagged as
manipulative; similar feature-based detection capabilities can also be
applied to identify synthetically-generated images and videos. Social
media companies and a new generation of tech start-ups also leverage
machine learning alongside human moderators to identify disinformation
and bot accounts, although these capabilities are not 100 percent
effective. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency has an ongoing
effort to develop forensic systems to improve abilities to spot
inconsistencies in deepfake content.

While authentication and detection tools are in development, they remain
imperfect. There are at least two distinct problems confronting these
capabilities: first, discerning whether media is synthetically produced,
and second, whether the information communicated by the media is true or
false. The techniques described above broadly address the first problem,
but the second is significantly more challenging to automate. To discern
whether media is true or false, an AI needs a sophisticated
understanding of, among other things, power, "history, humor, symbolic
reference, inference, subtlety, insinuation, and power." Because
detection systems lack these distinctly human abilities, threat hunting
still relies primarily on tips from human actors, including government,
media, and civil society partners --- a detection system that raises its
own questions about bias and fairness. Meanwhile, fully autonomous
detection systems also make mistakes. They sometimes mistakenly block
lawful and accurate content, which may impair freedom of expression and
information. Even the most advanced detection capabilities remain
susceptible to adversarial examples --- "optical illusions" for machine
learning models intentionally designed to make them misidentify images
and videos. And as discussed above, it is incredibly difficult to
determine whether a digital text was created by a human, a machine, or
some combination of the two.

The most direct way to combat AI-enhanced disinformation is to focus on
the infrastructure that facilitates its distribution. While Congress
could pursue legislation that directly regulates social media
algorithms, this approach must be carefully tailored to avoid serious
constitutional hurdles. Instead, legislation grounded in content-neutral
goals such as carefully labeling bot accounts, strengthening data
privacy laws, mandating cross-platform interoperability, increasing
algorithmic transparency, and fostering fair competition could offer
potential avenues for mitigating disinformation and safeguarding online
authenticity. The goal of regulation should be to give social media
companies incentives to shift away from their ad-centric business models
and take on a more significant role in protecting democratic information
environments. At the same time, regulations should be careful not to
impede AI research and risk weakening the United States' hand in its
technological competition with China.

Beyond these regulatory efforts, societal stakeholders should pursue
counter disinformation strategies. Congress could allocate funding for
new techniques to detect synthetic media, invest in local news
organizations across the country, and require services that sell
aggregated consumer information to vet potential purchasers. The U.S.
government should leverage allies and partners to share information and
best practices for detecting disinformation operations. Blockchain
technology --- a decentralized ledger to record information that is
nearly impossible to alter after it has been created --- has strong
potential to help verify the provenance of digital content. Platforms
and AI researchers should develop a publication risk framework to
protect their open-source research from unethical usage and adapt
cybersecurity best practices to counter disinformation. Traditional
media outlets must develop similar strategies to avoid unintentionally
amplifying disinformation operations. Critically, more resources,
training, and equipment should be allocated to civil society
organizations to cultivate a genuinely whole-of-society counter
disinformation strategy.

Open societies must pursue robust and long-term initiatives to help
their populations become more balanced and careful consumers of online
information. Promoting "cyber citizenship" for all age groups will be
the most effective long-term solution for achieving resilience to
disinformation. These skills include media literacy, digital ethics,
civics, and cybersecurity. The United States should incorporate lessons
learned from successful digital media literacy programs worldwide, many
of which it supported and funded. Cultivating cyber citizenship skills
will help inoculate individuals against disinformation operations,
whether AI-powered or not.

More broadly, as the Aspen Institute's Commission for Information
Disorder argues, spreading false or misleading information online is a
byproduct of complex structural inequities that have corroded trust
between and among communities. To truly address the spread of
misinformation and stymie deliberate disinformation operations, open
societies must address the widening gaps between the haves and have-nots
by investing in their citizens' long-term development and well-being.

School at Tufts University, Founding Executive Director of Fletcher's

to Its Potential During the Pandemic," Harvard Business Review,
https://hbr.org/2022/03/why-ai-failed-to-live-up-to-its-potential-during-the-pandemic/micahw

At the outset, [things looked promising]{.underline}. [Machines beat
humans in raising the early alert about a mysterious new virus out of
Wuhan]{.underline}, China. Boston Children's Hospital's HealthMap
system, which scrapes online news and social media for early signals of
diseases, along with a Canadian health news scraper, BlueDot, picked up
warning signs. BlueDot's algorithm even predicted cities most at risk if
infected people were to travel, all days before the WHO and weeks before
the rest of the world caught up.

As the world officially went into lockdown in 2020, [it was clear that
AI's game-changing contribution would be in **rapid
prediction**]{.underline} --- diagnosis, prognosis, and forecasting the
spread of an emergent unknown disease, [with no easy way to test for it
in a timely way]{.underline}.

Numerous AI-enabled teams mobilized to seize the opportunity. At New
York's Mount Sinai hospital, for example, a team designed an AI system
to quickly diagnose Covid-19 using algorithms trained on lung CT scans
data from China. Another group at MIT created a diagnostic using
algorithms trained on coughing sounds. A third team, an NYU and Chinese
collaboration, used AI tools to predict which Covid-19 patients would
develop severe respiratory disease. [We had heard]{.underline} **[for
years]{.underline}** [about AI's transformative potential]{.underline},
and suddenly [there was an **opportunity**]{.underline} [to see it in
action]{.underline}.

[So]{.underline}, [how did these **AI-powered** Covid predictors work
out?]{.underline} Put bluntly, **[they landed with a
thud]{.underline}**. [A]{.underline} **[systematic review]{.underline}**
in The BMJ of tools for diagnosis and prognosis of Covid-19 [found that
the]{.underline} **[predictive performance]{.underline}**
[was]{.underline} **[weak]{.underline}** [in real-world clinical
settings]{.underline}. [Another study at the University of Cambridge
of]{.underline} **[over 400 tools]{.underline}** [using **deep-learning
models** for diagnosing Covid-19 applied to chest x-rays and CT scans
data found them]{.underline} **[entirely unusable]{.underline}**. A
[third study reported in the journal]{.underline}, Nature, [considered a
**wide range of applications**]{.underline}, including predictions,
outbreak detection, real-time monitoring of adherence to public health
recommendations, and response to treatments [and found them to be
of]{.underline} **[little practical use]{.underline}**.

We can learn from these disappointments as we gear up to build back a
better AI, however. [There are]{.underline} **[four
places]{.underline}** [where the fault lines appeared]{.underline}:
**[bad datasets]{.underline}**, **[automated
discrimination]{.underline}**, **[human failures]{.underline}**, [and
a]{.underline} **[complex global context]{.underline}**. While they
relate to Covid-19 decisions, [the lessons are **widely
applicable**]{.underline}.

### AT: AI Solve Disease\-\--2NC

#### Bad datasets

Bhaskar **Chakravorti 22**, Dean of Global Business at The Fletcher
School at Tufts University, Founding Executive Director of Fletcher's
Institute for Business in the Global Context, "Why AI Failed to Live Up
to Its Potential During the Pandemic," Harvard Business Review,
https://hbr.org/2022/03/why-ai-failed-to-live-up-to-its-potential-during-the-pandemic/micahw

AI decision-making tools are only as good as the data used to train the
underlying algorithms. If the datasets are bad, the algorithms make poor
decisions. In the context of Covid, there are many barriers to
assembling "good" datasets.

First, the breadth of Covid symptoms underscored the challenge of
assembling comprehensive datasets. The data had to be pulled from
multiple disparate electronic health records, which were typically
locked away within different institutional systems and their
corresponding siloes. Not only was each system separate, they also had
different data governance standards with incompatible consent and
confidentiality policies. These issues were amplified by health care
systems spanning different countries, with incompatible patient privacy,
data governance, and localization rules that limited the wholesale
blending of such datasets.

The ultimate impact of such incomplete and poor-quality data was that it
resulted in poor predictions, making the AI decision tools unreliable
and untrustworthy.

A second problem arose from the way data was collected and stored in
clinical settings. Aggregated case counts are easier to assemble, but
they may omit key details about a patient's history and other
demographic, personal, and social attributes. Even finer details around
when the patient was exposed, exhibited symptoms, and got tested and the
nature of the symptoms, which variant they had been infected with, the
medical interventions and their outcomes, etc., are all important for
predicting how the virus might propagate. To compound the problems, some
datasets were spliced together from multiple sources, introducing
inconsistencies and redundancies.

Third, a comprehensive dataset with clues regarding Covid symptoms, how
the disease might spread, who is more or less susceptible, and how to
manage the disease ought to draw from multiple sources, given its
newness. In addition to data from the formal health care settings, there
are other critical information sources, datasets, and analyses relevant
for predicting the pathways of a novel and emergent disease. Such
additional data may be drawn from multiple repositories, effectively
tapping into the experiences of people grappling with the disease. Such
repositories could include Twitter, professional message boards,
analyses done by professionals and amateurs on "open-source" platforms,
medical journals, blogs, and news outlets. Of course, once you account
for so many disparate sources of relevant data, the process of
integration, correcting for wrong or misinformation, fixing
inconsistencies, and training algorithms increased the complexity of
creating a full dataset.

Even when there were data available, the predictions and decisions
recommended by health care management algorithms led to potentially
highly discriminatory decisions --- and concerns that some patients
received worse care. This is because the datasets used to train the
algorithms reflected a record of historical anomalies and inequities:
lower levels of access to quality healthcare; incorrect and incomplete
records; and deep-seated distrust in the health care system that led
some groups to avoid it.

There are broad concerns about the negative impacts of AI bias, but
during the pandemic, the consequences of such bias were severe. For
example, consider a pre-Covid study in Science that found that Black
patients were assigned the same risk level by an algorithm as white
patients, even though the latter were not as sick --- leading to
inadequate medical care for the Black patients. Looking ahead, as Black
and Hispanic Covid-19 patients suffered higher mortality rates than
white patients, algorithms trained on such data could recommend that
hospitals redirect their scarce resources away from Black and Hispanic
patients.

The ultimate impact of such automated discrimination is even more
distortionary when we consider that these disadvantaged groups have also
been disproportionately affected by the most severe cases of Covid-19
--- in the U.S., Black, Hispanic, and Native Americans were about twice
as likely to die from the disease as white patients.

#### Human error

Bhaskar **Chakravorti 22**, Dean of Global Business at The Fletcher
School at Tufts University, Founding Executive Director of Fletcher's
Institute for Business in the Global Context, "Why AI Failed to Live Up
to Its Potential During the Pandemic," Harvard Business Review,
https://hbr.org/2022/03/why-ai-failed-to-live-up-to-its-potential-during-the-pandemic/micahw

The quality of any AI system cannot be decoupled from people and
organizations. Behaviors, from choosing which applications and datasets
are used to interpreting the decisions, are shaped by incentives and
organizational contexts.

The wrong incentives can be a big problem. Managers overseeing health
care systems often had few incentives to share data on patients --- data
may have been tied to revenues, or sharing it may raise concerns over
patient confidentiality. For researchers, rewards were often aligned
with sharing data with some select parties but not everyone. Moreover,
there were few career incentives to validating existing results, as
there is greater glory in producing new findings rather than replicating
or validating other studies. This means that study results may not have
applied in a wide enough variety of settings, making them unreliable or
unusable and causing caregivers to hesitate to use tools that had not
been proven in multiple settings. It is particularly risky to experiment
with human health.

Then, there's the issue of data entry errors. Much of the data
accumulated on Covid-19 involved environments in which health care
workers were operating under pressure and extraordinarily heavy
caseloads. This may have contributed to mislabeled and incomplete
datasets --- with mistakes showing up even in death certificates. In
many countries, health care systems were underreporting Covid-19 cases,
either because they were encouraged to do so by the authorities, because
of unclear guidelines, or simply because staff were overwhelmed.

Even with AI tools on hand, the humans responsible for making decisions
often lacked critical interpretive capabilities --- from language to
context awareness or the ability to spot biases and mistakes. There
isn't, as yet, a uniformly accepted code of ethics, or a checklist, that
gives caregivers a sense of when to apply AI tools versus mitigating
harms by using judgment. This could lead to inconsistent use or misuse
of the AI tools and eventually undermine trust in them.

#### Global complexities + inequalities

Bhaskar **Chakravorti 22**, Dean of Global Business at The Fletcher
School at Tufts University, Founding Executive Director of Fletcher's
Institute for Business in the Global Context, "Why AI Failed to Live Up
to Its Potential During the Pandemic," Harvard Business Review,
https://hbr.org/2022/03/why-ai-failed-to-live-up-to-its-potential-during-the-pandemic/micahw

A pandemic, by definition, cuts across different political, economic,
and sociocultural systems. This complicates the process of assembling a
comprehensive dataset that aggregates across different countries with
widely applicable lessons. The pandemic underscored the challenge of
deriving universally applicable decision tools to manage human health
across all health care settings regardless of geographic location.
Appropriate medical interventions depend on many factors, from biology
to institutional, sociopolitical, and cultural forces to the local
environment. Even if many facets of human biology are common across the
world, the other factors vary widely.

For one, there are differences across countries in terms of their
policies regarding data governance. Many countries have data
localization laws that prevent the data from being transported across
borders. There is no international consensus on how health care data
should be shared. While the preexisting international network for the
sharing of influenza genome sequence data was extended to the sharing of
sequences for Covid-19, deeper data-sharing collaborations between
countries could have helped with ongoing management of the disease. The
absence of broader sharing agreements and governance was a critical
barrier.

Second, there were differences between developed and developing
countries regarding sharing of health care data. Some researchers argue
that genome sequences should be shared on open databases to allow
large-scale analyses. Others worry about exploitation; they are
concerned that researchers and institutions from poorer countries
weren't given adequate credit and the benefits of the data sharing would
be limited to rich countries.

Third, history and the sociopolitical contexts of countries and their
ethical frameworks for data sharing even within their own citizenry are
different, giving rise to differences in the willingness to have
personal data collected, analyzed, and shared for public use. Consider
the varied experiences with AI-aided exposure identification and contact
tracing apps.

South Korea presented an extreme example of intrusive data collection.
The country deployed contact tracing technology together with widespread
testing. Its tracking apps were paired with CCTV footage, travel and
medical records, and credit card transaction information. Koreans'
willingness to tolerate this level of intrusion can be traced to the
country's history. The previous administration had botched its response
to the 2015 MERS outbreak, when it shared no information about hospitals
visited by infected citizens. This led to public support for legislation
giving health authorities access to data on infected citizens and the
right to issue alerts. In contrast, the German government's contact
tracing app was rejected by the public once a highly critical open
letter from experts raised fears of state surveillance. As a result,
Germany abandoned the centralized model for a decentralized alternative.
Again, history provides an explanation. Germans have lived through two
notorious surveillance regimes: the Gestapo during the Nazi era and the
Stasi during the Cold War. Centrally controlled state data collection
was not destined to be popular.

Finally, the data on patients from one country may not be good
predictors in other countries. A variety of other factors from race,
demographics, socioeconomic circumstances, quality of health care,
immunity levels, co-morbidities, etc., make a difference.

[The power of]{.underline} artificial intelligence
(**[AI]{.underline}**), especially the capacity of machines to learn
from big data, [has been rising]{.underline} **[quickly]{.underline}**
[over the past decade]{.underline}. Everywhere, [transnational
corporations]{.underline} (**[TNCs]{.underline}**) [are turning
to]{.underline} **[AI]{.underline}** [to enhance the]{.underline}
**[productivity]{.underline}** [of supply chains]{.underline}, [increase
the **efficiency**]{.underline} [of operations]{.underline}, improve
product quality, [and]{.underline} **[boost sales]{.underline}**.
[Business executives and]{.underline} advocates of [corporate social
responsibility]{.underline} (CSR) [are]{.underline}
**[lauding]{.underline}** this [infusion of AI into global supply chains
as a **breakthrough** toward]{.underline} **[environmental
sustainability]{.underline}**. [Can AI transform the world's leading
TNCs into forces of sustainability**?**]{.underline}

[My answer]{.underline} in this article [is a sharp]{.underline}
'**[no]{.underline}**'. **[AI]{.underline}** [is]{.underline}
**[supercharging]{.underline}** [the technologies of **modern
capitalism**]{.underline}, akin to what electricity did after the late
1800s. Fundamentally, [it is a]{.underline} **[tool of
power]{.underline}**, [frequently]{.underline} [**deepening global
inequities** and the]{.underline} **[exploitation]{.underline}** [of
natural resources]{.underline}. [The world's most powerful TNCs are
deploying this tool to gain]{.underline} **[business
advantages]{.underline}**, **[compete for markets]{.underline}**,
**[extract natural resources]{.underline}**, **[cut
costs]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} **[grow
operations]{.underline}**. Leading the charge are technology firms such
as Google, Microsoft, and Tencent, electronics manufacturers such as
Apple and Samsung, and online retailers such as Alibaba and Amazon. But
many other **[TNCs]{.underline}** [are]{.underline} also [investing in
**AI**]{.underline} [to]{.underline} **[turbocharge]{.underline}** [the
efficiency of **profit-making**]{.underline}, [from]{.underline}
**[automakers]{.underline}** [to]{.underline} **[banks]{.underline}**
[to]{.underline} **[miners]{.underline}** [to]{.underline} **[oil
companies]{.underline}**. In doing so, TNCs appear to be improving
environmental management on some efficiency and productivity measures,
as CSR reports are quick to highlight. [Delving]{.underline} **[more
deeply]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[critically]{.underline}**
[into the international political economy]{.underline} (IPE)
[of]{.underline} **[a]{.underline}**rtificial
**[i]{.underline}**ntelligence, however, [reveals that the]{.underline}
**[vast majority]{.underline}** [of these]{.underline}
**[apparent]{.underline}** [gains **entail costs**]{.underline}
[for]{.underline} **[marginalized peoples]{.underline}**, **[distant
ecosystems]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} **[future
generations]{.underline}** -- costs [that CSR rhetoric and metrics
are]{.underline} **[obscuring]{.underline}** [from
consumers]{.underline}, [activists]{.underline}, [and
governments]{.underline}.

Set to infuse the world economy with another US\$16 trillion a year by
2030, AI is certainly going to bring socioeconomic benefits over the
next decade (PricewaterhouseCoopers, 2017, p. 5). At a micro-scale, the
environmental gains can even look impressive. Intelligent automation is
improving the energy efficiency of suppliers, factories, and data
centers. Learning algorithms are enhancing the efficiency of renewable
power grids by more accurately forecasting solar and wind generation
(Vinuesa et al., 2020). AI software is reducing food waste by more
precisely predicting consumer demand. AI analysis of equipment sensors
is anticipating maintenance needs to avoid costly breakdowns and
industrial accidents. And AI systems are managing supply chain logistics
to reduce expenditures, speed up delivery, and lower per product carbon
emissions of transportation (Agrawal et al., 2018, 2019; Davenport,
2018; Iansiti & Lakhani, 2020).

Through branding, messaging, and business metrics, corporate executives
and industry analysts are trumpeting the benefits of AI efficiency and
productivity, reinforcing a narrative of corporate responsibility,
effective private governance, and environmental progress. 'The
intelligence and productivity gains that AI will deliver', claims the
business consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (2018, p. 26), 'can
unlock new solutions to society's most pressing environmental
challenges: climate change, biodiversity, ocean health, water
management, air pollution, and resilience, among others'. 'Utilising AI
can have a dramatic effect on supply chains', argue business analysts
Boute and Gijsbrechts (2019, p. 52), 'helping organisations to benefit
from the fastest, cheapest and most sustainable routes for shipping,
combining these seamlessly'. Technological innovation and AI, says
Google's 2019 Environmental Report (2019, p. 10), is 'accelerating our
transition to becoming a circular Google that contributes to a
sustainable world'. Artificial intelligence offers 'endless
possibilities not only for companies and partners but for everyone to
benefit from improved societal impact, social good and sustainability',
argues Gretchen O'Hara (2020), the vice-president of AI Country Strategy
& Sustainability Partnership at Microsoft. AI is going to 'empower and
improve every business, every government organization, every
philanthropy -- basically there's no institution in the world that
cannot be improved with machine learning', argues Jeff Bezos (2017), the
chief executive officer of Amazon. 'It is a renaissance, it is a golden
age'.

As I argue in this article, **[however]{.underline}**, [eco-efficiency
gains from]{.underline} **[a]{.underline}**rtificial
**[i]{.underline}**ntelligence [are]{.underline} **[never]{.underline}**
[going to add up to significant progress toward **global
sustainability**]{.underline}, [as the profits]{.underline}
**[disproportionality]{.underline}** [enrich corporate
billionaires]{.underline}, as [productivity gains
**across**]{.underline} [global supply chains]{.underline} **[hide
ecological costs]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} as [TNCs]{.underline}
[**reinvest savings** from cutting waste and optimizing operations
into]{.underline} **[expanding production]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[consumption]{.underline}**. As the inputs and
outputs balloon, [global supply chains]{.underline}
**[increasingly]{.underline}** [look more like an]{.underline}
**[elongated hourglass]{.underline}** [than a chain]{.underline}.
Moreover, big tradeoffs are involved in making the middle sections
leaner. Robots and software are replacing workers. [The]{.underline}
**[infrastructure]{.underline}** [to support]{.underline}
**[AI]{.underline}** -- [including]{.underline}
**[computers]{.underline}**, **[data centers]{.underline}**,

**[coltan]{.underline}**, **[cobalt]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline}
**[rare earth elements]{.underline}** [in countries with]{.underline}

**[Automated marketing]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[targeted

China's Eurasian Strategy

After all that, it seems remarkable that [[Washington]{.mark}'s current
generation of foreign policy leaders]{.underline}, like Britain's in the
1950s, [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} so ~~blindingly~~ [[oblivious
to]{.mark} the geopolitics of empire---in this case, to
[Beijing's]{.mark} largely economic [bid for]{.mark} global
[power]{.mark} on that same "world island" (Eurasia plus an adjoining
Africa).]{.underline}

It's not as if China has been hiding some secret strategy. In a 2013
speech at Kazakhstan's Nazarbayev University, President
[[Xi]{.underline}]{.mark} typically [[urged]{.mark} the [people]{.mark}s
of Central Asia [to]{.mark} join with his country to "**[forge closer
economic ties]{.mark}, [deepen cooperation]{.mark}, and [expand
development]{.mark} space in the Eurasian region**." [Through
trade]{.mark} and [infrastructure]{.mark} "connecting the Pacific and
the Baltic Sea," this vast landmass inhabited by close to three billion
people could, he said, become "the biggest market in the world with
unparalleled potential."]{.underline}

This development scheme, soon to be dubbed the [**[B]{.mark}elt and
[R]{.mark}oad [I]{.mark}nitiative, would [become a massive effort
to]{.mark} economically [integrate]{.mark} that "world island" of
[Africa]{.mark}, [Asia]{.mark}, and [Europe]{.mark}** by investing well
more than a trillion dollars---a sum 10 times larger than the famed US
Marshall plan that rebuilt a ravaged Europe after World War II. Beijing
also [established]{.mark} the [Asian]{.mark} Infrastructure [Investment
Bank]{.mark} with an impressive \$100 billion in capital and [103 member
nations]{.mark}. More recently, China has [formed]{.mark} the [world's
largest trade bloc]{.mark} with 14 Asia-Pacific partners and, over
Washington's strenuous objections, [signed]{.mark} an ambitious
[financial]{.mark} services [agreement]{.mark} [with]{.mark} the
[E]{.mark}uropean [U]{.mark}nion.]{.underline}

[Such investments]{.underline}, almost none of a military nature,
quickly [[fostered]{.mark} the [formation of]{.mark} a [transcontinental
grid]{.mark} of [railroads]{.mark} and gas [pipelines]{.mark} extending
from East Asia to Europe, the Pacific to the Atlantic, [all linked to
Beijing.]{.mark}]{.underline} In a striking parallel with that 16th
century chain of 50 fortified Portuguese ports, [Beijing has also
acquired special access through loans and leases to more than 40
seaports]{.underline} encompassing its own latter-day "world
island"---from the Straits of Malacca, across the Indian Ocean, around
Africa, and along Europe's extended coastline from Piraeus, Greece, to
Zeebrugge, Belgium.

[With its **growing wealth**, China also built a blue-water navy that,
by 2020, already had 360 warships, backed by land-based missiles, jet
fighters, and the planet's second global system of military satellites.
That growing force was meant to be the tip of China's spear aimed at
puncturing Washington's encirclement of Asia. To cut the chain of
American installations along the Pacific littoral, Beijing has built
eight military bases]{.underline} on tiny (often dredged) [islands in
the South China Sea]{.underline} and [imposed an air defense
zone]{.underline} over a portion of the East China Sea. It has also
[challenged the US Navy]{.underline}'s long-standing dominion over the
Indian Ocean by opening its first foreign base at Djibouti in East
Africa and building modern ports at Gwadar, Pakistan, and Hambantota,
Sri Lanka, with potential military applications.

By now, [the **[inherent strength of Beijing's geopolitical
strategy]{.mark} [should be obvious]{.mark} to [Washington]{.mark}
foreign policy experts**, were their insights not [clouded by imperial
hubris]{.mark}. Ignoring the unbending geopolitics of global power,
centered as always on Eurasia, those Washington insiders now coming to
power in the [Biden]{.mark} administration somehow [imagine]{.mark} that
[there is still a fight to be fought]{.mark}, a competition to be waged,
a race to be run. [Yet]{.mark}]{.underline}, as with the British in the
1950s, [[that ship]{.mark} may well have [sailed]{.mark}.]{.underline}

By [grasping the geopolitical logic of unifying Eurasia's vast
landmass---home to 70% of the world's population---through
transcontinental infrastructures for commerce, energy, finance, and
transport, [Beijing]{.mark} has [rendered]{.mark} [Washington's]{.mark}
encircling [armadas]{.mark} of aircraft and warships redundant, even
[irrelevant]{.mark}.]{.underline}

As Sir Halford Mackinder might have put it, had he lived to celebrate
his 160th birthday last month, [the United States dominated Eurasia and
thereby the world for 70 years. [Now]{.mark}, **[China is taking
control]{.mark}** of that strategic continent and global power will
surely follow.]{.underline}

However, it will do so on anything but the recognizable planet of the
last 400 years. [Sooner or later, **[Washington will]{.mark}**
undoubtedly **[have to accept]{.mark} the unbending geopolitical reality
that undergirds the [latest shift in global power]{.mark} and [adapt its
foreign policy]{.mark} and [fiscal priorities
accordingly]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

. Views of the Post-Cold War International Order - Conventional
[structural perspectives frame mainstream **[Chinese]{.mark}** views of
the **"international [order]{.mark}"**]{.underline} (国际秩序), [as
"**[the most]{.mark} global, [long-term]{.mark}**, and
**[strategic]{.mark}** issue **[in world
politics]{.mark}.**"]{.underline}9 Official [narratives reject hegemony
and favor multilateralism in line with a post-Cold War shift to a
multipolar order. **In Xi's post-pandemic world**, "there is no
fundamental change in the trend toward a multi-polar world;
**[economic]{.mark} [globalization]{.mark} is [showing renewed
resilience]{.mark}**; and **the call [for upholding
multilateralism]{.mark} and [enhancing]{.mark} [communication]{.mark}
and coordination [has grown stronger]{.mark}**."]{.underline}10 [As Xi
defined it in January, "multilateralism is about having international
affairs addressed through consultation and the future of the world
decided by everyone working together."]{.underline}11
[**[Interpretations of]{.mark} [heg]{.mark}emony in this changing
structural context [have expanded from]{.mark} a primarily
[military]{.mark} [focus]{.mark} [to]{.mark} broader forms of
[expansionist behavior for]{.mark} regional or global
[dominance]{.mark}**.]{.underline} From a Chinese official's
perspective, [US "hegemonism" means "not occupying land but promoting
its own system and ideology, in an attempt to meet its own national
interests through domination of the world."]{.underline}12 According to
Yang Jiechi, [**[multilateralism]{.mark} today [prevails over]{.mark}**
[recent]{.mark} [pressures]{.mark} of "**unilateralism** and bullying,"
"populism and de-globalization," and "**ideological
confrontation**."]{.underline} In **[Chin[a's]{.mark} pursuit of
multilateral diplomacy]{.underline}**, ["we oppose hegemony and power
politics, and oppose any practice of unilateralism in the name of
multilateralism."]{.underline}13 Despite such official claims, [China's
multilateralism remains described as "strategic" and
"opportunistic."]{.underline}14 Yang Jiechi made clear in February, ["we
will resolutely defend our national interests and dignity at
multilateral fora when our core and major interests are at
stake."]{.underline}15 Skeptics view China's multilateral diplomacy as
part of counter-hegemonic strategies.16 The "new Chinese
multilateralism" that emerged by the 2000s "has to be understood with
its combination with multipolarism, the two being used together as a
double-track strategy to deal with the United States...and to shape
China's desired future structure of world politics."17 Xi's push for
global governance reform "is directly linked to counterbalancing the
dominance of a liberal-based international order."18 Especially at the
regional level, China-led multilateralism "is an interim arrangement in
China's drive to acquire regional and global dominance."19 Hegemony and
Multipolar Order - [Chinese assessments of hegemony and multilateralism
have evolved with perceptions of the changing world order. **[Studies of
the post-Cold War order]{.mark} [identify a long-term shift]{.mark} to
"multipolarization" and persistent threat of "hegemonism," [with a
growing emphasis on]{.mark} sovereignty and [non-interference]{.mark} in
internal affairs**.]{.underline}20 As Jiang Zemin indicated in 1997,
[while "the pattern of the world is moving in the direction of
multipolarization," "**hegemonism** and power politics continue to be
**the main source of threat to world peace** and
stability."]{.underline}21 Academic interpretations of such trends vary
in terms of the dimensions and distribution of global power. But [this
multipolar transition is commonly linked to perceived changes in US
power since the 1990s]{.underline}, when "one superpower, several great
powers" characterized the international structure according to Chinese
official assessments. [**[Views]{.mark} of multipolarization** [not only
**assume** more **global resistance to US demands**]{.mark}, [but also
**disagreement within the West favoring alignment with Chinese**]{.mark}
**[worldviews]{.mark}**.]{.underline} From a historical cyclical
perspective, power, interests, and rules shape the international order's
formation, involving "long-term competition and short-term compromise in
the pursuit of common values."22 [**Uncertainty** over the postwar
liberal international order's future **has grown with** the clear
**fragmentation of Western power**.]{.underline} China's position in the
existing order is viewed through the lens of US hegemony as the "peak
form of Western historical hegemony."23 [US political elites advanced
the "hegemonic" Bretton Woods system representing their preferences,
successfully managing a domestic isolationist tradition and foreign
resistance. With the decline in US relative power, US policy shifted
from "accepting" China into this dominant order to "rejecting"
it.]{.underline}24 [In particular, the United States can no longer
accept a rising China as a strategic partner or member of the
international system since "democratic discipline" has failed
there]{.underline}.25 [China's market transition from 1978 drove both
US-China conciliation and eventual discord as China advanced its own
economic and political agenda.]{.underline}"Two Orders" in US-China
Relations Views of US hegemony have varied with shifts in US-China
relations since the 1972 Shanghai Communique, which promised that
"neither should seek hegemony in the Asia-Pacific region and each is
opposed to efforts by any other country or group of countries to
establish such hegemony."26 While Chinese concerns in the 1990s centered
on external threats to Taiwan, domestic political stability, and ethnic
minority regions, the scope of contention now extends to economic and
technological competition. In addition, the transition from Deng's
"keeping a low profile" principle to Xi's "striving for achievement"
shifts China's external focus from primarily economic gains to political
support, raising questions about the normative dimensions of Chinese
grand strategy.27 [US-China debates in an evolving world order are
primarily about rulemaking]{.underline}. ["Two orders" form]{.underline}
Wang Jisi's view of curr[ent US-China relations, including the CCP-led
domestic order challenged by the United States, and the US-led
international order challenged by China.]{.underline} [With increased
interdependence, [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [frowns]{.mark}
[on]{.mark} the [CCP]{.mark} leadership's [rulemaking]{.mark} at home
not just for ideological reasons, but more importantly [for]{.mark} the
[implications for]{.mark} US [material interests]{.mark}.]{.underline}
[Conversely, US rulemaking at the global level threatens Chinese
interests. The [**US quest to "promote global** **democracy**"
**defies**]{.mark} [China's]{.mark} insistence on
**[non-interference]{.mark}** and the "**democratization of
international relations**" granting the developing "global majority" a
bigger voice]{.underline}.28 Yang Jiechi told Blinken in March, "it is
important for the United States to change its own image and to stop
advancing its own democracy in the rest of the world."29 As Wang Jisi
argues, "in Sino-US competition and cooperation today, almost everything
is connected to the issue of rules."30 [This issue will be the biggest
point of future contention]{.underline}, not [because the United States
fears]{.underline} being displaced by China economically, but because
"they are concerned about [how they will manage once they have been
overtaken]{.underline}."31 As Wang asked in 1997, "what will China do in
global and regional affairs when its international status is enhanced,
economic growth sustained, military capabilities improved, and political
stability ensured?"32 Current assessments of hegemony and
multilateralism offer tentative answers. Current Views of Hegemony and
Multilateralism [A general decline in Chinese]{.underline} academic
[interest in hegemony over the past two decades has accompanied a growth
in interest in multilateralism]{.underline}, at a notably faster rate
since 2016. Journal articles with the keyword "hegemonism" (霸权主义)
fell in volume by 83 percent in 2000-2016, and became outnumbered by
those with "multilateralism" (多边主义) from 2005 during the Hu Jintao
administration.33 In both cases, the number of articles more than
doubled in 2016-2019. But in 2019-2020, studies on hegemonism declined
by 20 percent while those on multilateralism grew by another 49 percent.
While the multilateralism literature amounted to 10 percent of
hegemonism studies in 2000 by publication volume, by 2020 it was almost
five times greater. [A perceived structural shift to a multipolarity
contextualizes these trends.]{.underline} From the perspective of
China's international relations theorists like Qin Yaqing, one of the
biggest changes in the past century is the end of not just US global
hegemony but also hegemony itself as a world order. [The [current
transition]{.mark} to a more pluralistic world of "inclusive
multilateralism" [points to]{.mark} "a multipolar power structure,
[multilevel]{.mark} [institutional arrangements, and]{.mark}
multidimensional [ideas]{.mark}."]{.underline}34 [An alternative "one

in the post-2008 trend of US economic strategy. According to Chen Yu,

[The period of the **COVID-19 pandemic** **has driven political thinkers
to reexamine the states' ability to manage crises** that are local and
global at once]{.underline}. Joseph Nye envisions [five different
**[scenarios for]{.mark} the [post-coronavirus world order]{.mark}**,
three of which **[are]{.mark} largely [characterized]{.mark}** or
majorly influenced **[by the rise of China]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
[In]{.underline} scenario ["the end of the globalized liberal
order,"\[]{.underline}6\] Nye focuses on [the US's diminishing position
as a leader of the international society, with an atrophy of the
collaborative institutions that had propelled and upheld its stance so
far.]{.underline} In this scenario, [China becomes increasingly involved
in setting global rules and norms -- a role which up until now had been
almost exclusively reserved for liberal democracies.]{.underline}
[In]{.underline} scenario ["a China-dominated world order,"\[7\] China
rises to prominence mainly by closing the economic gap between itself
and the US. Its material dominance becomes so overwhelming that the
normative international checks and balances are too weak to
institutionally resist the standards and reforms China and its major
companies instill.]{.underline} In scenario "more of the same,"\[8\] the
rivalry between the US and China is constrained through their
cooperation on issues such climate change. While the US remains the
largest superpower, its global influence lessens significantly. In fact,
authors are dedicating growing attention to the global competition
between Beijing and Washington and its implications. When attempting to
analyze the reasons behind the US-China trade war of 2018, for example,
Min-hyung Kim concludes that [its main driving force was ""US fear"
about its declining hegemony and China's rapid rise as a challenger of
US hegemony."\[]{.underline}9\] [Indeed, today it would be rare to find
a political thinker who believes China isn't on the rise.]{.underline}
Kishore Mahbubani explores China's growing geopolitical power vis-à-vis
the US, and writes that [[America]{.mark} has [experienced a steady
decline]{.mark} in its soft power over recent years -- a process
[exacerbated under]{.mark} the Donald [Trump]{.mark} administration --
which will challenge its ability to win the ideological battle between
itself and China.\[]{.underline}10\] When debating whether a Cold War
situation and consequent American victory can replicate themselves
between China and the US, the author emphasizes that [**[China]{.mark}
has already begun [taking preemptive measures against]{.mark}** a
possible **[containment]{.mark} policy** [through]{.mark} creating
partnerships]{.underline} [under the Belt and Road Initiative
([BRI]{.mark})\[]{.underline}11\] -- [a largescale global infrastructure
strategy developed by China, spanning across almost all parts of the
globe.]{.underline} Crucially, the author claims that China has as good
a chance as the US in emerging as the dominant state in the world
system, and that [**American victory is "far from
certain."**\[]{.underline}12\] Mahbubani even adds that leading
strategists and countries are increasingly preparing for the
geopolitical contestation between the US and China, which he sees as
inevitable.\[13\] [Unlike the Cold War period, however,
**[American]{.mark} cultural and economic [influence]{.mark} have
[significantly waned]{.mark} globally**, and China's economic strength
is far greater]{.underline} than that of the former USSR.\[14\]
[Notably, the **[COVID]{.mark}-19 crisis [revealed]{.mark}** not only
the **[shortcomings of]{.mark} the [US's crisis-management]{.mark}**,
**but also [those of its intertwinement with the liberal]{.mark}
democratic [order]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Anne Applebaum writes that the
[lack of clearheaded American guidance during the different stages of
the pandemic was so prevalent that "the whole idea of transatlantic
cooperation became moot."\[]{.underline}15\] As the author describes it,
[the most [salient failure]{.mark} of the system [was]{.mark} that the
[US]{.mark}, led by Trump, had [abdicated]{.mark} its [international
leadership role during the pandemic]{.mark}.]{.underline} Moreover,
Applebaum underscores China's role in undermining the international
system. She explains that for years now, [[China]{.mark} has put
explicit effort into [trying to integrate]{.mark} [itself]{.mark} and
instill its]{.underline} autocratic [values [in multilat]{.mark}eral
[organizations]{.mark}]{.underline}.\[16\] [The partnerships it seeks to
build are framed as based on a 'win-win' principle, contributing to
**China's [growing acceptance into international circles]{.mark}**.
Indeed, as the Trump administration was repeatedly sidelining
international organizations, particularly the World Health Organization
(WHO), China was increasingly collaborating with them. **These growing
acceptance and influence [need to be understood in parallel to America's
diminishing]{.mark} [ones]{.mark}**]{.underline},\[17\] and in terms of
the emerging competition between "dictatorship" and "democracy."\[18\]
Reviewing these works, [it becomes apparent that scholars are reaching
the consensus that China is on the rise -- being integrated into
international institutions and progressively asserting its economic
dominance.]{.underline} That said, while authors' conceptualizations of
the emerging world order acknowledge China's strengthened position, they
fail to adequately account for the increasing appeal of the Chinese
model. Scholars today understand that China's economic and geopolitical
prowess, as expressed during the coronavirus pandemic, may aid its
accumulation of international power in a manner that will require the
strategic attention of the US. However, they seldom consider how China's
model of governance and specific style of leadership have potentially
been revealed as more suitable for managing global crises than those of
liberal democracies -- a revelation that could significantly impact the
world order COVID-19 will leave in its wake. As Niall Ferguson writes,
[**the [remarkable]{.mark} [speed with which China had been able to
contain the virus]{.mark} has allowed it to [illustrate the strengths of
its model]{.mark}** and shape the pandemic's narrative in its
favor.\[]{.underline}19\] This paper will attempt to bridge the existing
literature gap by highlighting the attractiveness of the Chinese model
and leadership approach as part of the country's global rise, and
particularly as part of its growing influence in the MENA. China in the

[[China's]{.mark} [push to contest]{.mark} the [US-led hegemonic
order]{.mark} has long been in the making]{.underline}. [[Enabled by
**steady growth of**]{.mark} **material [capabilities]{.mark}** (both
[economic]{.mark}ally and [militar]{.mark}il[y]{.mark}) over the last
decades, Beijing has tried to enact a leadership role in world
politics]{.underline}. In contrast to Russia, which has sought to merely
contest the liberal world order and act as a spoiler state (see Loftus
in this volume), [[China]{.mark} has sought to **[broaden]{.mark} its
[influence]{.mark}** within UN institutions in order to shape policies
and norms from within the system.]{.underline} This strategy included
the successful bid to increase its vote-share within the IMF, where it
became the third largest shareholder in 2015. Chinese nationals also
claimed leadership positions within the UN, for example, in the Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO), the International Telecommunication
Union (ITU), the United Nations Industrial Development Organization
(UNIDP), and the International Aviation Organization (ICAO). Overall,
Chinese diplomats currently head 4 of 15 UN specialized agencies (see
Cheng-Chia & Yang, 2020). This has, in turn, enabled China to deny
Taiwan access to the WHO and the ICAO. China's increasing influence has
also become visible within the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC), which
adopted two resolutions in 2018 that reflected China's preference to
circumscribe the scope of human rights in favor of state sovereignty
(see Zhao, 2020, pp. 3--4). [**Outside established institutions of the
liberal world order**, China [spearheaded]{.mark} [new
initiatives]{.mark}, particularly [in]{.mark} the [economic
realm]{.mark}.]{.underline} Led by China and other BRICS members, the
Asian Infrastructure and Investment Bank, and the New Development Bank
were founded in 2014. [Together with [China's]{.mark} [B]{.mark}elt and
[R]{.mark}oad [I]{.mark}nitiative, its [ambitious infrastructure]{.mark}
and investment project, the hegemonic contender [signaled]{.mark} its
**[intent to translate]{.mark} its [economic clout into
bargaining]{.mark} [power]{.mark}** within global economic
institutions]{.underline} (see Wang, 2020). [Against this backdrop, the
**[COVID-19]{.mark} pandemic [presented a "strategic
opportunity"]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Gauttam et al., 2020, p. 15) [for
[China to cast itself as a global leader]{.mark}]{.underline} and to
promote President Xi Jinping's vision of a "Community of Shared Future
for Mankind"---Xi having described this vision as a doctrine to
"position China in the commanding heights of the international
competition" (cited in Zhao, 2020, p. 3). [While the [traditional
hegemon]{.mark} and its European [allies]{.mark} were [mired in]{.mark}
the [pandemic]{.mark}, the Chinese had successfully put the crisis
behind them in a short period of time. This enabled [China]{.mark} to
[broaden]{.mark} its [global reach]{.mark} in two key ways. First, China
tried to [cast itself as a global health soft power]{.mark}, seeking to
[improve]{.mark} its [image in response to]{.mark} a [worldwide
crisis]{.mark}]{.underline} (see State Council Information Office,
2020). Lauded by coordinated propaganda efforts in Chinese
state-controlled media, [China began to ship medical aid and PPE to
countries fighting COVID-19. They also dispatched medical personnel---in
particular to African countries that had already established business
ties to Beijing]{.underline} (see Gauttam et al., 2020). [Due to the
situation caused by the pandemic, **China was able to capitalize on its
position as the largest global supplier of epidemic prevention
goods**]{.underline} (Fazal, 2020, p. 13). The Chinese government also
exploited the opportunity created by the US' withdrawal from WHO,
pledging to step up its financial contribution to the organization. This
"mask diplomacy" also exposed existing fault lines within Europe during
the early phase of the pandemic, when European solidarity appeared weak
in view of national measures (Verma, 2020, p. 207). At the same time,
China's efforts to cast itself as a global health power were hampered by
faulty test kits and PPE, as well as by the aggressive rhetoric of its
"Wolf Warrior" elite diplomats, who sought to counter Western
accusations of a lack of transparency during the early phase of the
pandemic (see Harnisch in this volume). China also did not establish
itself as a provider of global public goods, as most of the help was
authorized on a bilateral basis and even its increased WHO funding fell
significantly short of previous US contributions (see Fazal, 2020, p.
4). Second, although not directly related to the pandemic, China also
sought to bolster its power position, both in terms of security and
economic strength. Here, it seems plausible that [the Chinese government
was able to **[exploit]{.mark} the strategic [window of opportunity
opened by]{.mark} other [states' preoccupation with domestic
priorities]{.mark}**---especially the US, which was in the throes of a
contentious presidential election. Several [empirical
observations]{.mark} [highlight]{.mark} [China's increased **post-Corona
assertiveness**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In April 2020, the People's
Republic designated new "administrative zones" in the South China Sea,
including the Paracel and Spartley Islands which are also claimed by
Vietnam. Although territorial disputes have lingered for several years,
the new measures can be seen as an attempt to formalize control in this
area (Thu, 2020). Another strategy designed to bolster its power
position can be detected in its policy toward Hong Kong. Here, the
Chinese government imposed a new National Security Law, tightening its
control over the Special Administrative Region and thereby undermining
the principle of "one country, two systems." It is important to note
that, in 2019, the Hong Kong government had withdrawn an extradition law
due to mounting domestic protests. In 2020, however, China pushed the
legislation through despite international criticism, thus exposing the
increased level of authority exercised by the Chinese government
(Rudolf, 2020, p. 7).3 China also escalated its simmering conflict with
Australia and implemented new customs against Australian exports. This
move was interpreted as a retribution for the Australian government's
calls to investigate the origins of the Corona pandemic and its
disapproval of China's human rights policies (Khalil, 2020). Here, China
signaled its intention to retaliate against international criticism and
deploy its economic leverage against weaker states. In [the realm of
[trade relations]{.mark}]{.underline}, the new Regional Comprehensive
Economic Partnership, signed on November 15, 2020, and including 15
Asian economies, [**[underscored]{.mark} [China's ability to cooperate
within multilateral trade regimes]{.mark}**, while the US, under the
Trump presidency, had withdrawn from the Trans-Pacific Partnership
spearheaded by the Obama administratio]{.underline}n (see Petri &
Plummer, 2020). In sum, these examples show that [Beijing sought to take
advantage of this international environment by realizing long-held
policy goals within several fields, and that, [ultimately]{.mark},
**China's international [position]{.mark} was [stronger than it had
been]{.mark} in the [pre-Corona]{.mark} period.**]{.underline}

According to Yan's theory, political leadership is derived of four
sources: authority, capability, morality and power.\[53\] Yan explains
his intention with the latter, power, through its Chinese equivalent
quanli -- meaning "legitimate coercive rights or duty."\[54\] Indeed,
Yan sees power as the type of coercion which enforces behavior.\[55\] As
his argument holds, political leadership becomes the key component of
"the attractiveness of a country's government model, which influences
other countries' actions without the use of hard power."\[56\] Given
that this paper is distinctly interested in understanding China's
challenge to American hegemony in terms of the country's cooptation
abilities and the attractiveness of its governance model, rather than
its coercive potential, the following segments will focus on examining
how this challenge manifested during the coronavirus pandemic using the
sources of morality, capability and authority only. Morality --
[**[Morality]{.mark}**]{.underline} is the most pertinent concept for
Yan's moral realism, and [mainly **[refers to]{.mark} whether a
country's behavior follows** the nationally and **[internationally
agreed upon]{.mark} [norms]{.mark} of action**.]{.underline}\[57\]
Admittedly, with the coronavirus' far-reaching impacts, it is difficult
to outline the international norms countries should have adhered to, and
whether they did so or not. Still, [a brief glance at past crises could
reveal previous courses of action from leading states. Most
significantly, during the financial crisis of 2008 and the 2014 Ebola
outbreak, the US and other great powers ensured to collaborate with one
another in finding a resolution for these global
challenges.]{.underline} Campbell and Doshi write that whereas, [in the
past, US governments would assemble a coalition of states to overcome
these joint challenges, former President Trump's policies during the
COVID-19 were anything but collaborative.\[]{.underline}58\] [As
[scholars agree]{.mark}, the **[absence of American leadership]{.mark}
[became glaring during]{.mark}** the
**[COVID]{.mark}**-19]{.underline}.\[59\] [When examining how China's
moral behavior throughout the coronavirus pandemic could help it rise
globally, it is thus crucial to also contrast it with the immoral
behavior]{.underline} -- in Yan's terms -- [of the US.]{.underline}
[Primarily, with the outbreak of the virus in the US, then President
**Trump stayed loyal to** his long-proclaimed policy of **"America
First."** While countries around the world battled with the first wave
of the pandemic, struggling to procure necessary medical supplies and
expertise, the [America]{.mark}n government [adopted]{.mark} an almost
surprisingly [nationalistic response]{.mark}. Rather than acknowledging
the public health risks of the novel virus, the COVID-19 was framed in
the US as a blatant and specific attack on the country's
sovereignty.\[]{.underline}60\] [Furthermore, essentially without
warning or an established agreement, the US closed its borders to
incoming travelers from Europe, conveying that its sole governance focus
during this crisis was the country itself]{.underline}.\[61\] [In fact,
in late May of 2020, the Trump administration even decided to begin
[withdrawing US funding]{.mark} and [WHO membership]{.mark}, citing the
organization's alleged control by China as the
reason]{.underline}.\[62\] [This decision was [criticized
widely]{.mark}, and was blamed for being an attempted distraction from
America's own failings in its response to the outbreak. Global health
experts further argued that a withdrawal of funds during this difficult
global crisis would be unimaginable and disastrous, **[accusing the US
government of]{.mark} [destructively disengaging with
institutions]{.mark}** pertinent for the crisis's
resolution.\[]{.underline}63\] As Francis Fukuyama put it, rather than
supporting and galvanizing international institutions, President Trump
antagonized and attacked them.\[64\] Global public health professionals
explained that the US' withdrawal would be damaging not only to the
organization and the international contamination efforts, but also
specifically harmful to American citizens. They warned that a withdrawal
would mean disconnecting the US from key channels of information,
leaving the country to fight on its own and the citizens vulnerable to
infection.\[65\] In Yan's terms, [this type of behavior could be deemed
flagrantly immoral, both domestically and internationally, as the US's
decision not to follow cooperation norms would mean an almost direct
risk for both communities is has a responsibility for: the global and
the local.]{.underline}\[66\] [**[China's]{.mark} [moral
behavior]{.mark} during the pandemic therefore greatly [contrasts with
the]{.mark} [US]{.mark}'s response.** Xi Jinping]{.underline}, head of
the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), had [capitalized precisely on the
isolationism Trump espoused during the pandemic, and made conscious
efforts to counterbalance this approach by increasing China's
participation in the global response to the virus]{.underline}.\[67\]
[He embarked on a markedly diplomatic campaign assembling international
leaders and health experts seeking to find a resolution for
all]{.underline}.\[68\] [Some even describe **China's approach as
[uniquely dedicated to championing]{.mark} the [global battle
against]{.mark} the [coronavirus]{.mark}**, **proactively initiating and
[promoting international coop]{.mark}eration through funding
[and]{.mark} participating in
[multilateralism]{.mark}**]{.underline}.\[69\] [It is this comparison
between the behaviors of the US and China towards international
institutions and fellow states that can highlight the moral leadership
Beijing has demonstrated in the time of the coronavirus
crisis.]{.underline} As Yan explains, [such a display of morality,
accompanied by material resources, can portray a state as a humane
authority and consequently propel its influence and even its
legitimacy]{.underline}.\[70\] **[[China's morality]{.mark} during the
pandemic's [outspread]{.mark}, and [the]{.mark} absence of such moral
adherence from the [US]{.mark}, is thus a [key contributing factor
to]{.mark} the [challenge it is]{.mark} increasingly [posing to US
he]{.mark}gemony.]{.underline}** Capability -- Capability in Yan's work
is conceptualized as strength.\[71\] The comprehensive capability of a
state, subsequently, can be divided into four domains: culture, economy,
military and politics. In this model, political capability shapes the
other three elements, and is largely determined by a country's ability
and willingness to reform, as well as the execution of reform in
practice. Therefore, political capability is both material and
nonmaterial in its nature.\[72\] Yan clarifies that political leadership
is a crucial factor shaping political capability, and political
capability ought to be understood as driving a country's comprehensive
capability.\[73\] Competent or incompetent leadership can accordingly
alter the relative capability of a great power.\[74\] This clarification
becomes pertinent when considering Yan's argument that changes in
leading states' capabilities can directly influence their relationship
with other states and the configuration of the international
system.\[75\] [Analyzing China's demonstrated capability during the
coronavirus crisis, and the US's shortcomings, could then indicate
possible changes to the current world order. Perhaps the most relevant
starting point for examining China's capabilities throughout its
pandemic response is by looking at how its leadership efforts were being
perceived.]{.underline} As previously mentioned, in a speech given in
late January 2020 by [[WHO Director]{.underline}]{.mark} General Tedros
Adhanom, he [publicly [applauded China]{.mark}'s work in combatting the
spread of the novel virus. He declared that China's response to the
virus was impressively rapid and has set "a new standard for outbreak
response,"\[]{.underline}76\] [also mentioning China's commitment to
aiding to and working with other countries. Adhanom praised China for
having invested itself in protecting not only its own citizens, but also
people around the world]{.underline}.\[77\] [Notably, Adhanom was not
alone in his praises. By the end of 2020, China was commended for having
responded efficiently, quickly and thoroughly to the pandemic's spread
-- by implementing the necessary measures to contain the virus through
advanced technologies and firm policies.]{.underline}\[78\] [These
successes were further emphasized in contrast to Europe's and the US's
continued struggles with their pandemic response. In Beijing's eyes,
these were [clear]{.mark} [indicators of]{.mark} the [superiority of its
model of governance]{.mark} and indeed, scientists agree that China
possesses marked systemic advantages in crises such as this one, due to
its ability to concentrate governmental power]{.underline}.\[79\]
[Undeniably, the **[US's]{.mark}** apparent **[inadequacy]{.mark}** **in
tackling the coronavirus' threat**, as well as its **[inward-looking
policy]{.mark} approach**, have been **an asset for Beijing's pursuit of
global leadership**]{.underline}**.**\[80\] Deborah Welch Larson
explains that highlighting areas of superiority in relation to a
dominant state can directly improve an aspiring great power's
international status.\[81\] [The repeated **[use of the term
"incompetent"]{.mark} when referring to** **the** **American President**
and his administration's virus response was thus an unsurprising
advantage for Xi. The American government's handling of the virus was
even framed at times as a "catastrophic policy
blunder,"]{.underline}\[82\] [and what might be **"[one of the greatest
failures of presidential leadership in
generations]{.mark}."**\[]{.underline}83\] [These harsh analyses should
not be overlooked.]{.underline} Political experts like Mireya Solís
highlight that the pandemic has truly revealed that leadership can be
measured in terms of competent governance.\[84\] [The incompetence of
the American administration during the pandemic took many forms and was
largely a consequence of an open refusal to form coherent policies based
on the advice of experts. The leadership vacuum in the international
community reflected the local vacuum in the US, where state officials
and governors were left scrambling to find a solution their President
refused to provide.]{.underline}\[85\] [It became apparent that the
American government was temporally incapable, and frequently unwilling,
to contain the extent of the coronavirus crisis. As the absence of
American guidance grew noticeable, the Chinese capacity to handle
national and international crises received increasing attention. In the
simplest of terms, Xi understood that providing the international system
with much needed global goods would not only shed a positive light on
the country's material capabilities, but also strengthen the view of its
leadership abilities.]{.underline}\[86\] [Whereas in the beginning
stages of the pandemic's outbreak one might have thought that Xi's
leadership aspirations would be diminished, due to the country's
blundered initial response, China's rapid recovery came to stand in
stark contrast to the West's continued struggle. While lockdowns were
being lifted in Wuhan and businesses could return to nearly full
operation, Western cities remained deeply entangled with the growing
effects of the pandemic. **[Leaders]{.mark}** from Europe and even the
US **[began to seek the advice]{.mark} and aid [of
China]{.mark}**[,]{.mark} marking Xi Jinping triumphant and burnishing
his credentials as a leader.]{.underline}\[87\] [This triumph is not a
minor one.]{.underline} The distribution of power in the international
arena, Yan explains, depends on the relative capability of states.\[88\]
[The demonstration of comprehensive capabilities, especially vis-à-vis
the deterioration of those of a dominant state, could then exponentially
aid a rising power fulfill its aspirations]{.underline}.\[89\] Overall,
throughout the coronavirus pandemic, Beijing has been able to
demonstrate precisely those necessary capabilities which Washington
lacked. Fukuyama emphasizes the failings of former President Trump in
handling the crisis, saying that he blocked the country from being able
to effectively operate, and pointing to his incompetence as the primary
cause for the US's inadequate response. Most significant within Yan's
framework, Fukuyama stresses that [even when the crisis necessitated it,
Trump was unwilling to change his governance
approach]{.underline}.\[90\] The willingness to reform is at the heart
of Yan's perception of how a country's capabilities manifest, and [the
American administration's refusal to do so therefore accentuates the
flaws in its model of governance]{.underline}.\[91\] In fact, even at
the time of writing the book, prior to the outbreak of the pandemic, Yan
claimed that the US's political leadership seems incapable of
implementing needed reforms domestically, which prevents it from being
able to answer the closing of capability gaps between itself and
China.\[92\] China's successful role in the global arena during COVID-19
has consequently made the inadequacies of the US "painfully
obvious."\[93\] Authority -- Auhority, quanwei in Chinese, is connotated
in Yan's work with "prestige or popular trust."\[94\] As a result,
authority can propel actors to follow a certain idea due to their trust
in it, and thus uses the confidence of others as its source.
[Furthermore, international authority is greatly derived of a country's
strategic credibility: the consistency between the promises it makes and
its practical actions, especially when it comes to honoring its
commitments towards allies]{.underline}.\[95\] [Having authority is
pertinent for a hegemon, as it is intricately tied with states'
voluntary will to fulfill the wishes of the dominant
state]{.underline}.\[96\] As Forman et al. put it, after its initial
stumble, China has consistently portrayed responsible leadership
domestically by recognizing the severity of the situation and
implementing measures to halt the spread of the coronavirus.\[97\]
[Certainly, in the early days of the COVID-19's outbreak, China
attempted to silence word of the novel virus' spread and was accused of
withholding vital information that could have helped contain the
pandemic. Nevertheless, **[Beijing was able to]{.mark} rapidly
[recuperate]{.mark}**.]{.underline}\[98\] [From
**[mass]{.mark}-[testing]{.mark}**, to **social [distancing]{.mark}**,
to the **use of advanced [technologies]{.mark}**, China seemed
profoundly dedicated to battling the virus.]{.underline} The authors add
that [**China was** in fact **"one of the few countries showing signs of
solidarity and providing support to other
countries."**]{.underline}\[99\] [Indeed, already in the early stages of
the pandemic, Beijing showed its benevolence by sending medical supplies
to other states and continues to do so today as it distributes vaccines
in states with lower- and middle-income, claiming that it is simply
fulfilling the role a great power such as itself
should.\[]{.underline}100\] In Yan's model, this consistency between
China's words and actions is important not only morally; it is key to
basing a country's international authority. Conversely, the seeming
'double standard' of the US is harmful for its status within the
international system and the authority it seeks to have.\[101\]
[Moreover, former President **Trump's rhetorical inconsistencies were
not the only factor damaging the US's authority** during the COVID-19.
The trustworthiness of the superpower was further impaired by the
seeming refusal of the former president and his administration to listen
to the advice of public health experts, let alone adhere to
it]{.underline}. The mayor of Miami, Francis Suarez, publicly expressed
his frustration with the negligent leadership on the side of the
president. Acknowledging that mask-wearing would have been instrumental
for the containment of the coronavirus' spread, Suarez said that people
saw no reason to do so, as their own president was not following these
measures nor recognizing their value. In a rather reflecting statement,
he added lamentably that people follow those who are meant to be
leaders.\[102\] Notably, Suarez was far from being the only political
figure in the country to express dismay at the administration's behavior
in the time of the outbreak. A senator from New Jersey said that "to
call Trump's response to COVID chaotic \[and\] incoherent doesn't do it
justice,"\[103\] and that it is harming America and American lives.
These calls were joined by a letter to Congress that was signed by over
30,000 global health and international law experts, who protested the
Trump administration's decision to withdraw from the WHO, pointing to
the direct cost it would have on the lives of citizens, as well as the
lives of people around the world.\[104\] [[Even in later stages of the
pandemic]{.mark}, in September of 2020, the [America]{.mark}n government
[refused to join COVAX]{.mark}, the [Vaccine Global Access
initiativ]{.mark}e, and was [unwilling to commit]{.mark} itself
[to]{.mark} vaccine aid to its [allies]{.mark}]{.underline}. As Yanzhong
Huang writes, [this American approach [allowed China to fill a
leadership]{.mark} [position the US had]{.mark} essentially
[abdicated]{.mark}]{.underline}.\[105\] Yan himself agrees that an
approach which disregards the value of global alliances undermines
international leadership.\[106\] Welch Larson also admits that former
President Trump saw alliances as a burden to the state,\[107\] and Solís
adds that such an approach, especially during a time like that of the
coronavirus pandemic, puts the US in a precarious position globally. She
explains that the large policy swings in the US between one
administration and the next are causing noticeable damage to the
credibility of the country.\[108\] Yan points to the untrustworthiness
of political leaders and state policies as a significant obstacle to
their ability to establish themselves as an international authority. The
reverberations of this lack of trust are felt in the unwillingness of
fellow states to collaborate for the resolution of common challenges and
threats.\[109\] [In the age of the COVID-19 pandemic, a global crisis
which solidified the importance of global governance, the hesitance to
trust a major power is more than problematic; it is **[shedding]{.mark}
a [concerning light on future cooperation
prospects]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [As the US stumbled with forming a
coherent stance on the novel virus, China was able to gain
trust]{.underline}, in Yan's terms, [by asserting policies that were in
line with the advice of experts and by conveying its desire to work
collaboratively. Apart from this increased trust, China also ensured to
present its model of governance as that which allowed it to be a
reliable source of expertise and aid during the global
crisis]{.underline}.\[110\] [In the eyes of Beijing, the central cause
for the failure of Western democracies to contain the virus at home was
their ineffective governmental model. The]{.underline} authoritarian
[system in place in China had been imperative in enabling the CCP to
take the needed measures against the virus while also safeguarding the
country's economy, showcasing the strengths of its design. The ways in
which liberal democracies, especially the US, stumbled in their response
and containment efforts served as proof, as far as China was concerned,
that these countries are unequipped to handle crises of the
sort]{.underline}.\[111\] As some concede, much of the confusion and
uncertainty which were sown in the US and globally derived of American
institutions showing their inadequacy, encouraging distrust in the
government.\[112\] That is a primary reason why [the pandemic has
revealed Washington as isolationist when it matters most, and
ill-prepared to lead the international community's response. Precisely
because such a significant amount of the legitimacy the US typically
enjoys at home and abroad flows from its domestic policies and
international contributions, the COVID-19 pandemic has become a test the
country sorely failed.]{.underline}\[113\] Speaking of China's crisis
governance during the coronavirus' phases, Asian policy scholars argue
that the centralized model of China and its strong bureaucratic
institutions were highly effective in containing the spread of the
pandemic.\[114\] These observations were repeatedly shared, singling the
Chinese grid governance as particularly suitable for pandemic
outbreaks.\[115\] If the confidence of followers is the source of
authority, as Yan claims, then China's authority may have spiked during
the pandemic.\[116\] [While Beijing built a strong case for why fellow
states should see it as a reliable figurehead in such public health
global challenges, [Washington]{.mark} all but [left an 'open door' for
another leader]{.mark} to take over]{.underline}.

[The outbreak of [COVID-19]{.mark} pandemic has not only impacted the
world healthcare system, but it, rather, likely will **[change]{.mark}
the post-COVID [geopolitical world order]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The
scale and substance of the pandemic right now seem beyond the control of
the impacted countries, maybe it is for the time being? Several
conspiracy theories have been floated to make someone a scapegoat and
divert attention from the gravity of the grim situation(s). Blame game
has become the order of the day. [The [pandemic]{.mark} has
[caused]{.mark} a [severe]{.mark} loss of men, materials and
consequently a severe [economic slump]{.mark} and stagnation in the
geo-economic world order even critical than the 1930s. Concomitantly,
the [geopolitical world has]{.mark} [become more uncertain]{.mark} due
to the changing of power equations.]{.underline} It has become a double
whammy for the people as well as for countries. The poor countries had
not only seriously affected by COVID-19 pandemic, rather the developed
countries were also become unable to provide the required healthcare
facilities to the affected people. [The outbreak of the novel
coronavirus pandemic has [put]{.mark} the entire [world at]{.mark} an
[inflection point]{.mark}.]{.underline} The first case of the novel
coronavirus was initially detected in late December 2019 in Wuhan
(Duarte, 2020). The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the
outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic as a Public Health Emergency of
International Concern on 30 January 2020 and WHO Director General
recognized it as a 'Pandemic' on 11 March 2020 (WHO, 2020a). It has
impacted 216 countries/territories worldwide, resulting in the death of
788,503 people by 21 August 2020 (Worldometer, 2020). [The **COVID-19
pandemic** has not only [exposed]{.mark} the [status of]{.mark} the
[healthcare system]{.mark} of the world but also **[triggered]{.mark} a
[geopolitical debate]{.mark} [about]{.mark} the [hegemon]{.mark} of the
world** in terms of major powers.]{.underline} The term hegemony has
been derived from the Greek word 'Hegemonia' that refers to the
leadership and rule (Mowle & Sacko, 2007). Liberal theorists like
Keohane (1984, p. 34) have defined hegemony, 'as a situation, in which
one state is powerful enough to maintain, and willing to do so, the
essential rules governing inter-state relations'. He further argued that
hegemony can be preserved less through coercion and more through consent
by exercising the leadership in such a way. Cox (as cited in Schmidt,
2018) is one of the leading neo-Gramscians who had argued that coercion
and consent are the two important characteristics of hegemony.
[**[China's hegemonic power has been expanding]{.mark}**, given its
[massive]{.mark} size of [economy]{.mark}, demographic dividend,
[large]{.mark} geographical [size]{.mark}, [modernized military]{.mark},
[nuclear power]{.mark}, sophisticated science and [tech]{.mark}nology, a
large pool of human resources and its position as the world's
manufacturing hub. China has been expanding its hegemonic influence
through the consent and coercive measures. The current **COVID-19
[pandemic]{.mark} crisis has [created]{.mark} a [strategic
opportunity]{.mark}** and the same was [used by **China to
expand**]{.mark} **its [leadership]{.mark} [through]{.mark} the [health
diplomacy]{.mark} as a soft power tool**. Moreover, health diplomacy has
[helped China]{.mark} to [project]{.mark} its [image as]{.mark} a
[benevolent]{.mark} world [leader]{.mark} in many Asian, African and
Latin American countries. Given this critical situation, [many countries
have been accepting]{.mark} the [Chinese medical]{.mark}
[support]{.mark} without any coercion, [giving consent to
Chinese]{.mark} [projects]{.mark} like One Belt One Road (OBOR) and
market access]{.underline}. In this backdrop, the main argument of this
article is that China's strategic influence has been expanding, thus,
intensifying the battle for hegemonic influence between China and the
USA. A number of conspiracy theories have been doing rounds in the
geopolitical narratives, particularly from the USA and China, over the
outbreak of the novel coronavirus. [The officials from China and the USA
have been blaming each other for the origin of the coronavirus pandemic.
The strategic competition between both the countries has been going on
in terms of 'Blame Game' and 'War of Words']{.underline}. The Western
media has raised suspicions on the Chinese rhetoric of emergence of the
COVID-19 pandemic from the seafood market. They, however, claimed that
the virus could have emerged and originated from the Institute of
Virology (Wuhan) (Economic Times, 2020a). Moreover, President Donald
Trump has also been using the term 'Chinese Virus' and has claimed
China's institute of virology as an epicentre of the COVID-19 pandemic
(Matthews, 2020). On the contrary, China claimed that the virus did not
originate from Wuhan but, rather possibly from the USA as a bioweapon
(Davidson, 2020). [Soon after the outbreak of the pandemic in Wuhan, the
epicentre of the pandemic had shifted to the USA; meanwhile,
**[China]{.mark}** has not only **portrayed the image of a successful
country** **to combat the virus**, but, rather, it is also [ready to
help]{.mark} the [world]{.mark} at large. The world has experienced the
USA as a world hegemon since the Cold War, consistently providing
leadership during the crisis/calamities/ pandemics, etc. However, during
the current situation of COVID-19 pandemic, both the [US]{.mark}A and
[EU]{.mark} have been [remained at]{.mark} the
[crossroads]{.mark}]{.underline}. Moreover, Trump\'s unilateral decision
of imposing travel ban on the EU people further strained the
Transatlantic relations. [[China]{.mark} has **exploited the opportunity
out of the emergency by [providing]{.mark} massive [healthcare]{.mark}**
and **medical aid** [to more than 100 countries]{.mark}.]{.underline} In
this backdrop, would the global health diplomacy employed by China
likely provide an edge, that is, geopolitical space to change the
existing status quo and turn China as a hegemon in the post-COVID-19
world order? The main objectives of this article are, first, to analyse
how China has made health diplomacy as part of its soft power diplomacy
and, second, would the health diplomacy provide China with a
geopolitical opportunity to expand its hegemonic influence? The article
has been divided into the following sections: Section I discusses the
introduction of the article. Section II examines how the COVID-19
pandemic has severely affected the world's healthcare system. Section
III analyses the theoretical concept---how health diplomacy is embedded
in the framework of soft power for a nation? Section IV describes and
discuss the role of health diplomacy in China's foreign policy pre- and
post-outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Section V examines the response
of the USA and the EU to deal with the pandemic in its own region as
well as other affected countries. Section VI analyses the current status
of China and the USA in the world, and how the pandemic has provided
geopolitical space for the former's hegemonic status?

[[Global]{.mark} **[health diplomacy]{.mark} has [become]{.mark} the
most [striking feature of China's foreign]{.mark}**
[policy]{.mark}]{.underline}. Since 1949, [China has been using health
diplomacy [as]{.mark} a [soft power tool]{.mark} in its foreign
policy]{.underline}. Under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping (1978--1992),
[China has designed its comprehensive health diplomacy that
[includes]{.mark} both **[bilateral]{.mark} and [multilat]{.mark}eral
medical and health [cooperation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Fravel and
Medeiros (2003, p. 22) have argued that under Xiaoping's strategic view,
['peace and development were the two major themes of today's
world...**[Beijing]{.mark} has [embarked on]{.mark} a [new road to
economic modernization]{.mark}** **and** **[reoriented]{.mark} its
[foreign policy to heighten]{.mark} the [diplomatic
relations']{.mark}**]{.underline}. Under Deng Xiaoping, the [Chinese
foreign policy had stood for 'a low profile, do something and
concentrating on establishing a favourable external climate for domestic
economic growth]{.underline} (Chang, 1991; Suisheng, 2010; Xu & Du,
2015). However, given the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory
syndrome---SARS (2003) in China and its inability to handle the same had
significantly dented its global image. Moreover, it had highlighted the
major shortcomings of China's healthcare system. Chan et al. (2012, p.
203) argued that SARS has caused a loss to the Chinese economy to the
tune of US\$ 6.1 billion or gross domestic product (GDP) contraction of
about 0.5 per cent in 2003. It had compelled the Chinese government to
increase its budget on public health. President Hu Jintao (2002--2012)
had played an active role in designing health diplomacy with the tag
line of 'Harmonious Society' (Goldizen, 2016). The calls for 'peaceful
development' and 'harmonious world' have been used by China to project
itself as a benevolent country in the post-SARS world. The same was
substantiated by the argument of Goldizen (2016) who noted that China's
improved preparedness had become evident, particularly in the context of
an effective control of the 2009 H1N1 epidemic and 2013 avian influenza
outbreak (H7N9). [[Under]{.mark} the incumbent President [Xi]{.mark}
Jinping, the [world]{.mark} has been [witnessing]{.mark} a paradigmatic
shift in China's foreign policy from the strategy of low profile to
[strive for]{.mark} the [hegemonic role]{.mark}]{.underline} (Jisi,
2011; Lanteigne, 2019; Pei, 2018; Rühlig, 2018; Xuetong, 2011; Yan,
2014). [Under the incumbent regime, global health diplomacy has emerged
as an important element of Chinese foreign policy.]{.underline} Although
[the Chinese healthcare diplomacy]{.underline} is veiled in altruism,
the same [is primarily used for expanding the geopolitical and
geo-economic influences]{.underline}. Xi Jinping's 'China Health Vision
2030', announced in 2016, has given pivotal importance to healthcare
policies locally and globally (Tan et al., 2017). Along with these
policy measures, [President Xi Jinping had expressed his commitment in
January 2017 to construct a 'Health Silk Road' (HSR) by signing a
memorandum of understanding with the WHO]{.underline} (Lancaster &
Rubin, 2020). [The primary objectives of HSR include the organization of
the high-level regional health officials' forums, the establishment of a
Belt and Road Public Health Network for coordinated response to public
health emergencies, and capacity building and professional
training]{.underline} (Bing, 2020). [Therefore, the [outbreak]{.mark}
[of]{.mark} the novel [coronavirus]{.mark} pandemic paves the new roads
for China's global health diplomacy, which is, of course, a rhetorical
[extension of]{.mark} its [B]{.mark}elt and [R]{.mark}oad
[I]{.mark}nitiative]{.underline} (BRI, Lancaster et al., 2020). [Since
the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, **[China]{.mark} has been [providing
medical aid to]{.mark} many [countries]{.mark}, [including]{.mark} the
[US]{.mark}A and [EU]{.mark}** under its global health diplomacy to
recast itself as a responsible global health leader]{.underline}. Since
1949, the People's Republic of China (PRC) has been aggressively
pursuing health diplomacy. The African continent was China's first floor
test for its health diplomacy to attain its geopolitical ambitions.
China sent its very first medical team to Algeria under the direction of
the former Premier Zhou Enlai on 6 April 1963 (Jing et al., 2011). Since
then[, China has been [providing]{.mark} medical aid in terms of
[physicians]{.mark}, hospital [buildings]{.mark} and clinic
construction, and educating and [training]{.mark}]{.underline} the
African [medical personnel.]{.underline} With the introduction of
'African Policy' in 2006, [China has highlighted again how health
diplomacy has been figuring in its foreign policy in the twenty-first
century vis-à-vis this region.]{.underline} [The main focus of this
policy included the promotion of effective malaria treatment, sending
medical teams and equipment, training of physicians and supporting the
research on traditional medicine to treat and prevent
HIV/AIDS.]{.underline} During the 2006 African Cooperation Forum (CACF),
China had pledged to double its aid to Africa by 2009 and also offered
preferential loans of US\$5 billion to the continent (Youde, 2010). By
the end of 2010, China had sent 1,700 medical workers to 48 African
countries (Wharton, 2011). From the earlier discussion, it is crystal
clear that the Chinese government has been exercising its health
diplomacy for the developing countries in general, and particularly in
the African continent[. Now, the question is what benefit does the
Chinese government hope to gain from these soft power engagements with
the recipient countries? A Pew Global Attitudes Project Survey (2014)
has shown that both the USA and China now have almost equal geopolitical
influences in African states]{.underline} (Simmons, 2014). Sending
doctors to African countries has helped [**China to [build]{.mark} its
[benevolent image among]{.mark} the local [leaders]{.mark} [as well
as]{.mark} with the [common people]{.mark}**.]{.underline} When Africans
see that the Chinese doctors have saved the lives of their people, it
[creates a benevolent and **favourable image of China** in the hearts
and minds of the common people]{.underline}. [Indeed, in this
background, it is a [challenging]{.mark} [situation for the US]{.mark}A
[to maintain]{.mark} its [dominance]{.mark} in the region]{.underline}.
Furthermore, through these medical aid programmes, **[the [Chinese
government]{.mark} has [portrayed]{.mark} per se [as]{.mark} [the only
country that can work]{.mark} in [the interests of]{.mark} the
[developing countries]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Apart from bilateral
cooperation, **China has [expanded]{.mark} its [influence]{.mark} in
international health affairs and further [enhanced]{.mark} its
[cooperation with international]{.mark} and regional
[organizations]{.mark}**, such as UNICEF, World Bank,
ASEAN]{.underline}, Great Mekong Sub-region, Shanghai Cooperation
Organisation (SCO), etc.

China had realized the power of WHO during the SARS outbreak in 2003,
when WHO issued several travel advisories against unnecessary travel to
Guangdong province without taking any prior consent of China and also
put the latter in the spotlight for spreading infectious diseases in
many countries. Chan et al. (2012, p. 4) have argued that 'perhaps this
stance has invoked the Chinese government to realize the political
importance of the WHO and to increase its participation in global health
governance'. China has nominated its citizen Margaret Chan for the
election of the WHO Director-General held in 2006 and won the same. The
victory of Chan was widely believed as a diplomatic triumph for China,
as it was substantiated by the management of the Hong Kong issue and the
successful implementation of China's 'One Country, Two Systems' policy
(Shen, as cited in Chan et al., 2012). Concomitantly, Beijing had also
blocked Taiwan's attempt to seek WHO membership. Given the importance of
international organizations in general, and the WHO in particular, China
had begun to participate more actively in global health governance as
well. [Given the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, **[China]{.mark} has
[used]{.mark} global [health diplomacy to build]{.mark} its [benevolent
i]{.mark}mage** and to seek a **fertile ground for its geopolitical
influence [in]{.mark} several regions such as [Africa]{.mark},
[Asia]{.mark} and [Europe]{.mark}**]{.underline}. China has made the
best use of its health diplomacy by providing medical aid to the African
countries. As per the report of Mwangi (2020), China had sent 5.4
million facemasks and more than one million test kits and thousands of
protective suits to African countries as early as March. China had also
sent medical teams to several African countries such as Algeria,
Nigeria, Zimbabwe, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia,
Burkina Faso, Sudan, Djibouti and Côte d'Ivoire to combat against the
COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, medical experts from more than 30
African countries have conducted webinars with Chinese counterparts on
how to efficiently handle the coronavirus outbreak in the continent
(Olander, 2020). Lina Benabdallah (as cited by Jevans Nyabiage in SCMP
News, 2020) said that, ['**Covid-19 had [provided]{.mark} an
[opportunity for Beijing]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} [show]{.mark} [it
was]{.mark} not only [a goods provider]{.mark} but also an **[expert
on]{.mark} pandemic management and [global health']{.mark}**. The
above-mentioned developments show that **[China]{.mark} has been
[emerging as]{.mark} a [high-profile humanitarian aid
provider]{.mark}**, which was [at one point]{.mark} of time the
[monopoly of the USA.]{.mark} Asian countries have remained an important
part of Chinese global health diplomacy. Chinese medical experts had
visited many ASEAN countries]{.underline} like Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar. [A considerable
amount of material aid has been provided by the Chinese
government]{.underline} as well as private businessmen. Medical
knowledge and expertise have been shared with the ASEAN countries via
video conferencing. ASEAN SecretaryGeneral Dato Lim Jock Hoi had
expressed appreciation by saying that, 'With such aid, China and the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations, demonstrate that we support one
another even at the community and individual levels in ensuring that we
stay safe and healthy' (ASEAN, 2020). The South Asian countries such as
Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan, Maldives, Sri Lanka and Afghanistan were
the major recipients of the medical aid. The list included the testing
kits, personal protective equipment (PPE), masks and other medical
supplies (Pal & Bhatia, 2020). Recently, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang
Yi had joined a virtual conference with his counterparts from
Afghanistan, Nepal and Pakistan to discuss a fourpoint plan to contain
the COVID-19 pandemic, boost economic recovery and resumption of the BRI
infrastructure projects (Times of India, 2020). China has donated over
400,000 masks, 500 prefabricated rooms with beds, desks and chairs, and
a waste disposal facility worth €1 million, and it has sent medical
experts to Iran (Stojanovic, 2020). Moreover, China's Foreign Affairs
Ministry has urged the USA to remove sanctions on Iran by stating that
it will hamper Iran's response to the epidemic and also restrict
delivery of humanitarian aid by the UN and other organizations (Economic
Times, 2020). [In reciprocation of China's generosity, the
[Iran]{.mark}ian Ambassador to China [tweeted]{.mark}, '[China
is]{.mark} undoubtedly [the most experienced in]{.mark} the [fight
against]{.mark} the [coronavirus]{.mark} and is more determined to help
us']{.underline} (Gupta & Singh, 2020). [This shows the goodwill on the
part of Iran for Chinese humanitarian aid. **[China]{.mark} has [left no
stone unturned]{.mark} to exploit the geopolitical opportunity**,
[given]{.mark} the [hostile relations between]{.mark} the [US]{.mark}A
[and Iran]{.mark}. Given the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the
European continent has been a battlefield for China and the USA. The USA
had imposed travel bans on the Europeans, whereas **[China]{.mark} had
openly [supported]{.mark} the cause of [Europe]{.mark}ans [by providing
substantial medical]{.mark} and financial**]{.underline}
[**[aid]{.mark}.** Under the global health diplomacy, not only China but
also its company like Huawei]{.underline} and businessman Jack Ma [have
generously provided medical aid to several European countries such as
the [Czech]{.mark} Republic, [Spain]{.mark}, [Italy]{.mark},
[Belgium]{.mark}, [France]{.mark}, [Serbia]{.mark}, [Hungary]{.mark},
etc.]{.underline} Stojanovic (2020) has observed that [amidst the
coronavirus pandemic, **[several]{.mark} Eastern [European
countries]{.mark}** such as Serbia, Hungary and the Czech Republic had
**[appreciated]{.mark} [China for its medical]{.mark} [aid]{.mark}. On
the contrary, these countries had [criticized]{.mark} the [EU for its
delayed]{.mark}, inert [bureaucratism]{.mark} [and]{.mark} the [US
isolationism]{.mark} apropos pandemic.**]{.underline} China's medical
aid to Serbia included a medical team with expertise in combating the
COVID-19 pandemic, 1000 rapid test kits and other medical supplies in
the first batch of 16 tons of donations (Xinhua, 2020).
[[Serbian]{.mark} [President]{.mark} Aleksandar Vucic had appreciated Xi
Jinping for medical aid. He [said]{.mark} that 'They have proven as
friends in the most difficult times when we fight for the lives of the
Serbian people']{.underline} (Vuksanovic, 2020). He further made a
statement that, '[[European solidarity does not exist]{.mark}. [Only
China can help']{.mark}]{.underline} (Vuksanovic, 2020). [The [Hungarian
gov]{.mark}ernment has acknowledged and [appreciated]{.mark} the
[Chinese gov]{.mark}ernment for providing medical]{.underline}
[aid]{.underline}. According to Xinhua (2020), China has provided
80,000 + 41,000 surgical masks, 15,000 KN95 masks and 300 protective
suits to Hungary. [The Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban had
appreciated China and [criticized]{.mark} the [EU for]{.mark} the
latter's [inability to fight]{.mark} against the coronavirus
[pandemic]{.mark}]{.underline} (Stojanovic, 2020). [Italy, Spain, the
Netherlands and Slovakia have also appreciated China for its medical
aid. **[Beijing]{.mark} has [offered medical aid to Turkey]{.mark}**,
which is the second most affected country in the Western region by the
COVID-19 pandemic.]{.underline} Beijing had provided 50,000 rapid
detection kits and has shared medical knowledge with Turkey via video
conferences to treat the patients suffering from the COVID-19 pandemic
(Gupta & Singh, 2020). However, the Chinese government had faced
criticism from the Turkish people and health experts due to its faulty
masks and equipment. Hence, unlike Iran, China's medical aid had
received a mixed response from Turkey. [China has been using the ongoing
pandemic as an opportunity to push forward its 'Health Silk Road'
diplomacy to expand its geopolitical and geostrategic influences.
Moreover, the Chinese government has been using its global health
diplomacy to overcome the allegations made by the USA for not preventing
the virus from turning into a dangerous global pandemic. This kind of
**[soft power projection]{.mark} by Beijing is further intensifying
rivalry between the USA and China** and also **[accelerating]{.mark}
their [race to win]{.mark} the title of [hegemon in]{.mark} the
[post-COVID-19 world]{.mark} order**.]{.underline} Recently, Chinese
President Xi Jinping has expressed his desire in a telephonic
conversation with the Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte that he
wanted to establish a 'Health Silk Road' as part of China's ambitious
BRI project (FMPRC, 2020). The Communist Party of China is well aware of
the importance of Iran and Turkey as a gateway to Western markets for
its BRI project. Therefore, China has been trying hard to expand its
influence in both countries through its health diplomacy. Wong (2020)
has argued that notwithstanding criticism from some European countries,
given the faulty and low-standard medical equipment, [the contribution
of healthy combination of medical supplies such as facemasks, sanitizers
and financial aid has **helped [Beijing]{.mark} to curry favours and has
[won]{.mark} hearts and minds of one-half of a [divided
Europe]{.mark}**. Consequently, **several countries from the region have
already extended their whole-hearted support to the Chinese BRI**, which
aims to expand China's geo-economic influence in the European
countries.]{.underline}

[When attempting to explore the meanings of US-China competition for the
Middle East, a significant factor scarcely considered is China and the
MENA's historical and ideological relationship.]{.underline} Daniel
Markey writes that although since the end of the Cold War China's ties
with the Middle East have largely been motivated by the Gulf's energy
resources, the country's history with the MENA dates far back.\[20\]
[Iran and China, for example, share a historical bond of social and
cultural exchange which was largely enabled by Persian settlement in the
Chinese territory. The extension of the emotional connection between the
two former empires grew further as they experienced the humiliation of
their own dissolution, and the contrasting sight of the rise of European
imperialism.\[]{.underline}21\] The prominent argument Markey develops
is that **[[M]{.mark}iddle [E]{.mark}astern [leaders]{.mark} today [are
attracted to]{.mark} [Beijing]{.mark}]{.underline}**['s]{.mark} "model
of growth without political freedom."\[22\] [As Iran and China still
view themselves within the context of their respective long histories of
power and cultural significance, they sentiments of resentment towards
the West. While their political motivations often diverge, [their
worldview is]{.mark} still [similar]{.mark} in its illiberal values,
allowing them to form "mutually beneficial
collaboration."\[]{.underline}23\] [This ideological relationship is
doubtlessly crucial for Beijing's global and regional
ambitions.]{.underline} In an endeavor to elucidate China's growing
bonds with the Middle East, Michael Clarke writes that
[**[China]{.mark}'s foreign policy [is]{.mark} becoming progressively
[informed by]{.mark} the [wish to combat American heg]{.mark}emony** and
its geopolitical implications, and to **[build "a viable]{.mark}
strategic and economic [alternative to the]{.mark} current
[US-led]{.mark} international [order]{.mark}."** \[]{.underline}24\] [As
Chinese security concerns grow, both in and [because of]{.mark} the
[MENA]{.mark}, and [American geopolitical influence]{.mark} in the
region [decreases]{.mark}, China is encouraged to act out an agenda
aimed at reshaping regional dynamics to suit its own
interests.\[]{.underline}25\] Clarke states that [China perceives the US
hegemony as constraining its foreign policy ambitions, both globally and
in the Middle East, and holds that the American 'geopolitical resolve'
has fluctuated. These two elements have factored into [China]{.mark}'s
approach, which **[seeks to leverage]{.mark} its [non-Western
identity]{.mark}** []{.mark}and **[sparse interference]{.mark} in
regional politics** to the country's advantage.]{.underline} \[26\]
Progressively, the [[American primacy]{.mark} in the Middle East came to
be [viewed by Beijing as]{.mark} a [pivotal obstacle]{.mark}
[for]{.mark} its [diplomatic]{.mark} and strategic regional
[prospects]{.mark}. This recognition, partnered with China's desire to
expand its economic growth and promote anti-hegemonic ideology,
profoundly shape the country's interest in the MENA: [weapon
sales]{.mark}, its own [energy]{.mark} security, and
[relationships]{.mark} [with]{.mark} certain "rogue"
[regimes]{.mark}]{.underline}.\[27\] Now, although China is still
reliant on oil-prices which are in part modulated by the US, Salman et
al. write that Beijing's dependence on Middle Eastern countries' oil is
preventing it from risking their relationship, even at the cost of being
unaccommodating towards Washington.\[28\] [**With the understanding that
America's** **control over Middle Eastern oil** and **crucial naval
routes are granting it global preponderance** that is of strategic risk
to [China]{.mark}, **the country [began to]{.mark} specifically [engage
with Iraq, Iran]{.mark} and [Saudi Arabia]{.mark}**]{.underline}.\[29\]
[The ties between Iran and China were further [solidified by]{.mark} the
signing of a [military coop]{.mark}eration [agreement]{.mark}, and
[Chinese missiles]{.mark} and [tech]{.mark}nology have by now even found
their way [in]{.mark}to [Yemen]{.mark} and [Lebanon]{.mark}, with
strategic cooperation only expected to grow as China's military
capacities advance.\[]{.underline}30\] [The importance of these bonds in
shaping the post-pandemic world order cannot be understated, as China
intertwines itself with MENA geopolitical dynamics.]{.underline} As
Clarke argues, [China sees itself as able to bring stability to the
region through the evening out of imbalanced economic development and
incremental mitigation of the US's geopolitical
power.\[]{.underline}31\] However, although scholars recognize the
tightening economic and strategic relationships between China and the
MENA, only few seem to pay explicit attention to the growing Chinese
legitimacy in the region, and how it is undermining the US's
long-standing hegemony. This paper aims to address the existing gap
overlooking how [**[China's]{.mark} model of '[peace through
development']{.mark} [rather than 'liberal peace' is gaining]{.mark}
increasing [legitimacy]{.mark} from [M]{.mark}iddle [E]{.mark}astern
[leaders]{.mark}, who [find a]{.mark} wealthy and
[non-interfering]{.mark} [hegemon an appealing replacement for]{.mark}
the [America]{.mark}n alternative**.\[]{.underline}32\] [The global
[hegemonic stagnation of the US]{.mark}, specifically [during]{.mark}
the [COVID]{.mark}-19 pandemic, [will]{.mark} further [be linked to
M]{.mark}iddle [E]{.mark}astern political
[dynamics]{.mark}.]{.underline} By bringing these two bodies of
literature together, this paper seeks to elucidate the MENA's relevance
for understanding the grander picture of the burgeoning US-China
competition.

[Even the architects of Operation Iraqi Freedom were convinced Iraqi oil
revenues would quickly fund reconstruction of a US client state that
would help redraw the contours of the Middle East in America's
favour. But if oil and influence were the prizes, then it seems China,
not America, has ultimately won the Iraq war and its aftermath ---
without ever firing a shot. **Today [China,]{.mark} the [world's]{.mark}
[largest importer of]{.mark} crude [oil]{.mark}, [is Iraq's biggest
trading partner]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Only Russia sells more oil to
Beijing. In the first half of this year, Iraqi oil shipments to China
increased almost 30 per cent from a year earlier and accounted for more
than a third of Iraq's total exports. During a visit to Beijing last
year, [Adel Abdul Mahdi, then [Iraq's prime minister, described]{.mark}
Sino-Iraqi [relations]{.mark} as [poised for a "quantum leap]{.mark}"
and his electricity minister wrote "China is our primary option as a
strategic partner in the long run." Meanwhile, **[Iraqi]{.mark} oil
[exports to the US nearly halved]{.mark} in the first half of the year**
and the Pentagon plans to reduce its remaining troops in Iraq by a third
in the coming months. A **[similar dynamic]{.mark} is playing out
[in]{.mark} [Afghanistan]{.mark}, as America's longest war finally draws
to a close**.]{.underline} Afghan and Pakistani officials tell the
Financial Times that [**[Beijing is]{.mark} effectively [in control
of]{.mark} the [peace process]{.mark}** and is [promising]{.mark} the
[Taliban]{.mark} lavish [energy]{.mark} and infrastructure
[investment]{.mark} once the US has left for good. China's influence is
rapidly growing across the Middle East at a time when American
commitment is being questioned by regional allies and US politicians
alike. Beijing is [the biggest foreign investor in the region]{.mark}
and has sealed strategic partnerships with all Gulf states apart from
Bahrain. Most investment has gone to traditional US allies, many of them
also eager customers of Chinese military technology]{.underline}.
China's first ever overseas military base was established in Djibouti
three years ago. But Beijing is also investing heavily in commercial
ports that could easily be converted to naval use in other strategic
locations, including Pakistan's Gwadar and Oman's Duqm port on either
side of the Gulf of Oman. Along with the Strait of Malacca between
Malaysia and Indonesia's island of Sumatra, China considers the Strait
of Hormuz and the Bab al-Mandab Strait as critical to its economic and
military survival since the bulk of its energy imports are shipped
through these strategic chokepoints[. As Sino-US relations deteriorate,
Beijing's goal of increasing control of these waterways and reducing
America's ability to cut them off in a conflict has taken on greater
urgency. **It is the [main reason why China has built a navy]{.mark}
that is now bigger, if not [more advanced]{.mark}, [than]{.mark} that of
the [US.]{.mark}**]{.underline} [Until recently, Beijing had followed a
hands-off policy in the Middle East of being a friend to everyone but
allies with none. The success of this has been on display as it
[negotiates]{.mark} a \$400bn investment and [security pact with
Iran]{.mark} [while assisting]{.mark} Iran's enemy [Saudi Arabia]{.mark}
with its nuclear programme. And it fully [supports]{.mark} the
[Palestinian]{.mark} cause [while charming Israel]{.mark} into sharing
state of the art **technology** and leasing key strategic ports to
Chinese state enterprises.]{.underline} But perhaps the most powerful
sign of China's rising influence in the region is the fact that almost
every Muslim-majority country has supported the incarceration of as many
as 2m Muslims in re-education camps in western China. In public
statements and joint letters to the UN, countries including Saudi
Arabia, Egypt, Kuwait, Iraq and the UAE have all praised the camps and
suppression of Islam in the region of Xinjiang as necessary
"counterterror and deradicalisation" efforts that have brought
"happiness, fulfilment and security". [In the US, two successive
presidents have been elected on promises to extricate the country from
Middle Eastern entanglements. In the wake of the shale oil revolution,
with America now virtually self-sufficient in energy, the rationale for
pouring more blood and treasure into the sand looks thin. Washington's
resistance to playing regional policeman while other countries,
particularly China, reap all the benefits has been evident for a
while.]{.underline}

Yan Xuetong asserts that a humane authority derives its power and
legitimacy from the way it is being perceived by others: as a benevolent
state, able to meet the economic and security needs of fellow
countries.\[118\] [Indeed, [during]{.mark} **the [COVID-19]{.mark}
pandemic, [China made]{.mark} concerted [efforts to display]{.mark} its
[benevolence]{.mark}** and its ability to rise to the occasion as a
global leader in times of crisis. These **efforts were particularly
pronounced [in the Middle East]{.mark}**, as President Xi capitalized on
the opportunity to strengthen existing relationships and build new ones
through medical diplomacy and generous aid.]{.underline}\[119\] [China's
vaccine diplomacy in the area, for example, is said to have helped it
reap "soft-power dividends" with local BRI countries and had regional
leaders feeling grateful. These sentiments are important to highlight,
as they could translate into increased cooperation and
allegiance]{.underline}.\[120\] [The **[leadership vacuum created
by]{.mark} the [US]{.mark} during the pandemic [was palpable]{.mark} in
the Middle East** and [exacerbated by]{.mark} the practical [needs of
MENA]{.mark} states. Even countries like Jordan, a close ally of the US,
found themselves in cooperating with China. The Chinese vaccine
distributed by Sinopharm became the backbone of the Kingdom's
inoculation program and subsequently made medical experts in the country
reevaluate their previous notions on Chinese-produced pharmaceuticals
altogether]{.underline}.\[121\] [Indeed, [Chinese vaccines were
being]{.mark} purchased and [used]{.mark} not only [by states]{.mark}
predisposed [to seek non-American solutions]{.mark}, [but also
by]{.mark} the [US]{.mark}'s own [allies]{.mark}, [including the]{.mark}
United Arab Emirates ([UAE]{.mark}) and [Egypt]{.mark}]{.underline}.
With China, alongside Russia, having incrementally chipped away at
American clout in the region, analysts believe its vaccine diplomacy was
an attempt both to further establish itself as an adept scientific
leader and to expedite its influence within the Middle Eastern
order.\[122\] Importantly, it seems this attempt was successful. MENA
countries' vaccine purchases were arguably driven by diplomatic
considerations, which in turn reflect China's growing regional
prevalence. As Steven Cook confirms, [**[China's prestige]{.mark} in the
MENA is [undoubtedly growing]{.mark}** -- a significant feat in an area
which has long been predominantly under the influence of the US. Like in
other parts of the world, this upswing was in part propelled by the
absence of American guidance, its devaluing of science, and unwavering
inward focus]{.underline}.\[123\] Likewise, Bamo Nouri and Inderjeet
Parmar write how, as the pandemic progressed, **[[Washington's
dominance]{.mark} in the MENA was being increasingly [challenged in ways
which may not be]{.mark} easily [reversible]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
[They recognize a realignment of powers within the region, accelerated
by the political necessities of the COVID-19. Middle Eastern
countries,]{.underline} the authors argue, [had to find new ways to
operate both independently and collaboratively "as the international
co-operative instruments of the US-led liberal order seem\[ed\] absent
and ineffective during the crisis."]{.underline}\[124\] [Notably, this
absence has not only pushed China forward, **[due]{.mark} [to]{.mark}
the [zero-sum]{.mark} [nature of]{.mark} [political]{.mark}
[power]{.mark}**,]{.underline}\[125\] [but also strengthened its
alliance with Iran. With surmounting pressure on Iran by US sanctions
and its domestic coronavirus crisis, China became instrumental for the
country's ability to tackle the spread of the pandemic, aiding in the
form of crucial medical supplies and training. It should come as no
surprise then that this help greatly contributed to China's soft power
in the MENA]{.underline}.\[126\] [The lack of activity and declining
influence of the US in the time of this crisis, and the subsequent
vacuum these formed, may lead in the long term to a 'China-oriented'
order supported by the country's diplomacy and humanitarian
aid.]{.underline} Nouri and Parmar explain that [because of the
**[coercive]{.mark} [means]{.mark} [by which]{.mark} the [US]{.mark}
historically [approached the region]{.mark}**, and its leadership
failure during the pandemic, its ability to influence local dynamics in
the MENA is on the decline. The [Trump]{.mark} administration'[s]{.mark}
[choice]{.mark} [to persist in these ways]{.mark} during a global crisis
which necessitated effective and responsive leadership only [served to
push M]{.mark}iddle [E]{.mark}astern countries [into partnerships which
exclude the US]{.mark}]{.underline}.\[127\] Arab countries' choice to
purchase Chinese vaccines is therefore only a small indication of the
brewing partnership between Beijing and the Middle East.\[128\] In terms
of Yan's framework, China has been specifically able to demonstrate its
morality, capability and authority in the MENA region, and thus gain
growing legitimacy for itself and its governance model. As quickly
became apparent during the crisis, China was more than willing to adhere
to international norms of aid and cooperation and demonstrate the type
of moral behavior Yan claims are necessary for a state's rise. In the
Middle East, this was exemplified both in statements and action. The
Chinese Foreign Minister, Wang Yi, marveled at the solidarity between
China and the MENA during the stages of the pandemic, and expressed that
these times of crisis highlight the shared stake of countries around the
world. True to these words, [China had collaborated with all Arab states
in the region, including those in conflict situations like Syria and
Palestine. It sent out medical supplies, hosted dozens of joint meetings
with the Arab League and had Chinese medical experts visit Arab
countries nearly 100 times.\[]{.underline}129\] According to Yan, moral
behavior can directly contribute to the legitimacy of a state and its
leadership, and thereby increase its influence upon others.\[130\] [In
the specific context of MENA, China has importantly been able to assert
its commitment to regional norms and demonstrate a morality
simultaneously consistent with the international system as well as the
local one. Alongside its donations and medical contributions, **Beijing
reaffirmed its "respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity,
non-aggression and non-interference in internal
affairs"**]{.underline}\[131\] [in a joint statement with Qatar.
Moreover, China was able to boost its strategic credibility in the
region and the perception of its capabilities. Its rapid economic
recovery from the financial effects of the virus' outbreak had been
contrasted with the lag of the US, and made economies in the Gulf
increasingly reliant on China for developments in areas such as
telecommunications]{.underline}.\[132\] [In terms of the vaccine, many
Middle Eastern states had placed their trust, sometimes exclusively, in
Chinese-produced shots]{.underline}.\[133\] [This trust is of great
significance for the vindication of China as an increasingly legitimate
player in all realms of crisis-resolution, and illuminates the seeming
superiority of its authoritative model in combating such
challenges]{.underline}.\[134\] In Yan's understanding, this trust
attests to the capacity of a state to attract an international
following.\[135\] As the theoretical framework of this Capstone project
holds, legitimacy is one of the two pillars upon which hegemony stands.
China's growing image as a competent leader by MENA countries, and the
legitimation of its model considering the practical success it has had
in aiding the region to combat the spread of the coronavirus, can have
lasting reverberations for China's position within the Middle East.
US-China Competition in a Post-Pandemic Middle East -- While it is
difficult to predict in which ways China's rise will manifest globally
in the post-pandemic era, there are several indicators which could
suggest why the MENA region should come under scrutiny. [Throughout
recent years and increasingly so during the COVID-19 crisis, Beijing and
its model have received broadening legitimacy in the Middle East.
[Perhaps]{.mark} the [most glaring example]{.mark} of the type of
support China is receiving in the region [is]{.mark} the
**[overwhelming]{.mark} [endorsement]{.mark} [of]{.mark} its [BRI
plans]{.mark}**. Countries across the MENA, from **[Egypt]{.mark} to
[Saudi]{.mark} Arabia to [Iran,]{.mark} [have all committed]{.mark}
themselves** to some form of participation in the
Initiative]{.underline}.\[136\] [And the support does not end there.
[Countries in the Gulf]{.mark} are defying US pressure and
**[hiring]{.mark} the Chinese giant [Huawei to build 5G
infra]{.mark}structure** in their respective states. Even Israel, the
US's longstanding ally, is resisting pressures from Washington asking it
to limit economic ties with China, who invests hundreds of millions of
dollars in the country's tech sector yearly]{.underline}.\[137\] As Eyck
Freymann succinctly put it: "These countries agree on almost nothing ---
but they all want closer ties with China."\[138\] Although it could
appear, at surface level, that the majority of the MENA's interactions
with China are limited to economic and infrastructural endeavors, the
reality of these relationships is far more complex. **[The gradual
[embrace of China]{.mark} into the Middle East is in part [driven by its
opposition to]{.mark} external [interference]{.mark} in sovereign state
affairs]{.underline}**.\[139\] [Regional leaders are heard being
increasingly vocal about their cooperation with China, citing strategic
partnerships as motivating these newfound bonds]{.underline}.\[140\] [As
many thinkers readily admit, **US influence is waning in the Middle
East**, a fact which gives leeway for China to strengthen its own ties
with local leaders and states. The most prominent feature Beijing seeks
to emphasize in the MENA is its model of governance and development, one
that differs greatly from the Western-connotated model of 'liberal
peace,' and rather focuses on stability, aid and investment instead of
democratic reform. This [model is extremely attractive]{.mark} in a
region where development without democracy could be precisely what
leaders seek.]{.underline}\[141\] [Indeed, the decline of the US as a
regional hegemon has much to do with its policy choices, and the MENA's
dissatisfaction with American policies had only been intensified during
the tenure of former President Trump. While Middle Eastern state leaders
previously disagreed with the political decision-making of President
Obama, but at the very least understood it, it was the [Trump]{.mark}
administration['s "wildly inconsistent"]{.mark}\[]{.underline}142\]
[[policies]{.mark} that [sowed serious doubt]{.mark} about the US's
ability to continue serving the same position it had long represented in
the region. These inconsistencies can be described in terms of sudden
policy swings, public internal disagreements, and mixed messaging to
local leaders. Most notably, the Trump administration's [withdrawal
from]{.mark} the [Iran nuclear deal]{.mark} (JCPOA) not only [capsized
years of multilateral]{.mark} diplomatic [efforts]{.mark}, it also "cast
profound doubt on the reliability of any U.S.
commitments."]{.underline}\[143\] As Yan writes, when a country's
strategic credibility is questioned and its government deemed
unreliable, its ability to be an interstate leader can be
short-lived.\[144\] Due to increasing uncertainty about the US's
intentions as well as cooperation abilities, regional leaders are
progressively turning towards China to secure their economic and
strategic interests, a move which has been more than welcomed by
Beijing. [As the region turns even more turbulent than before, with
intra-regional disputes and growing domestic challenges to state
leaders, it is naturally less inclined to shape its priorities around
the interests of the US in the way it did before. The MENA is becoming
less amenable to the control America attempts to exert upon it as it
sees a country struggling to commit to neither economic nor political
shared objectives]{.underline}.\[145\] [Like **Biden's national security
adviser** Jake Sullivan **says, Xi Jinping is pitching the autocratic
model as an effective problem-solving mechanism more overtly than ever
before.** With China's rise in the international arena in general, and
in the Middle East in particular, the US will have to find new ways to
demonstrate its democratic model works.]{.underline} \[146\] A testament
to the extent of China's legitimization in the Middle East, a
predominantly Muslim region, is the marginal backlash it has received
from local leaders over its treatment of the Uyghur people. Over recent
years, more and more reports have been surfacing, documenting the
incarceration of around 1.5 million Uyghurs in 're-education' camps in
the northwest Chinese region of Xinjiang where they live.\[147\] The
Uyghurs are a Muslim minority in the country, who are said to have long
suffered from suppression of their ethnic identity and even persecution
at the hands of the Chinese government. From destroying sacred mosques
and temples, to forcefully attempting to assimilate them into the
Chinese political culture and re-balance the demographic in Xinjiang
through Han migration, it has become gradually apparent that China set
itself the distinct mission of controlling the region at any
cost.\[148\] In the camps, the 're-education' of children and adults
takes the form of severing the Uyghurs' linguistic and cultural links to
their ethnic identity; a process conducted under strict and invasive
surveillance.\[149\] From China's end, these measures are being
justified through Confucian notions of fostering social harmony,
accompanied by a claimed necessity to counter the potential of Xinjiang
becoming a 'breeding ground' for domestic terrorism.\[150\] Beijing has
been able to frame this Muslim minority, because of their
ethno-religious identity, under the umbrella of the international War on
Terror, and render the Uyghurs a dangerous population seeking to harm
the Chinese people.\[151\] Surprisingly, China seems to have been able
to carry out these policies with little to no criticism from Muslim
leaders in the Middle East -- arguably a testament of its growing
regional influence and legitimacy. The Saudi Crown Prince has praised
China for its crackdown on the terroristic potential of the Uyghurs and
was remarkably not the only one.\[152\] His statement was echoed by
leaders from Kuwait, Iraq, Egypt, and the UAE, who sent a formal letter
to the UN conveying that China's necessary 'counter-terrorism' efforts
in Xinjiang have brought "happiness, fulfilment and security"\[153\] to
the region. Iran, Oman and Syria have further expressed their public
support for Beijing's right and need to 'de-radicalize' the Xinjiang
area from Uyghur hostilities, in staunch support of China's sovereignty
rights.\[154\] Even Tukey, who had previously been a proponent of the
Uyghur strife, seeing as they are a Turkic people with an Istanbul-based
diaspora, has by now gone quiet on the issue. Moreover, there are even
allegations that Erdogan's Tukey had arrested Uyghur people at China's
request -- a move fueled by the country's growing reliance on Chinese
money for its weakened economy.\[155\] Considering MENA countries'
emblematic pan-Muslim sentiments and backing of Muslim minorities
worldwide, their overwhelming siding with China's repressive policies
against the Uyghurs cannot be cast as anything but a powerful symbol of
the legitimacy and influence Beijing is cultivating in the Middle
East.\[156\] [[Some]{.mark} writers, in fact, have already begun
[address]{.mark}ing the [MENA]{.mark} region [as]{.mark} being
'**[post-US]{.mark}**,' and claim that China can be crowned the biggest
winner of this transition]{.underline}.\[157\] [Already being the
largest consumer of regional oil, it is now also the only country which
has significant economic and political ties with all of the most
powerful actors in the Middle East. For Washington, this reality means
that "the Middle East is reemerging as an arena of great-power
competition."]{.underline}\[158\] [Indeed, the alliances that China is
forming in the region, especially with Iran and anti-American militias
is concerning for the US and poses threats to its own assets and
partnerships in the region. During the Trump presidency, harsh US
pressures on the Iranian Republic have only empowered state hard-liners
that are considered enthusiastically pro-China. One can expect this
bolstered partnership between the two states would serve, among other
outcomes, to allow Iran to up its nuclear deal negotiation bargain with
the Biden administration.]{.underline}\[159\] [No less substantial,
**[America's]{.mark} more committed [allies]{.mark} like certain Gulf
countries and Israel are [reluctant to take a]{.mark}ny [side]{.mark}**
in this budding geopolitical rivalry between China and the US. While the
contentions between the two great powers are not exclusive to the Middle
East, and even span to maritime competition, the MENA is seemingly
opening itself up to Chinese engagement. From states to organizations
like Hezbollah, to Shiite factions in Iraq, all of which are developing
intertwinements with Beijing, the US is facing heightened threats to its
regional allies and to its own strategic assets. **The importance of
protecting these would be a determining factor in America's engagement
with China in the MENA in coming years**]{.underline}.\[160\] An aspect
which should further not be undermined is how crucial the Middle East is
to President Xi's global aspirations. China's route to becoming the
center of the global economy involves the ability to secure access to
oil and shipping lanes in the MENA. These have fundamental importance
for its geostrategic objectives.\[161\] There is a lot at stake for
China, and it would be willing to travel great lengths in order to
continue its expansion. [In light of its worsening relationship with the
US, **[China sees it as paramount to secure waterways]{.mark} which the
[US may later try to cut off]{.mark} in conflict**. For this reason, its
navy has exponentially grown and is now bigger than its American
counterpart, if not more advanced]{.underline}.\[162\] With the Levant
expected to become instrumental for the success of Xi's BRI, [China is
developing close ties with states that would assist the fulfillment of
its ambitions. Through extremely generous loans and aid packages to Arab
countries, priced at over twenty billion dollars, as well as promises
for extensive employment possibilities for the local population, China
has been able to assert its soft power in the region and foment an
environment that would openly welcome expansionism in the form of the
BRI]{.underline}.\[163\] Consequentially, China's growing entanglements
in the Middle East are almost bound to come at a certain price; one
which would weaken its ability to stay neutral in regional disputes.
[Indeed, the importance of the Middle East for China's BRI prospects
means it is re-envisioning the political order of the region, and
actively attempting to create one that is multipolar, adhering to its
touted model of developmental peace rather than the West's democratic
peace. [Because of]{.mark} the [inherent volatility]{.mark} of the MENA,
and China's interests within it, the [country may find itself driven
into involvement]{.mark} in security questions it has up until now
avoided -- [largely due to the US's own]{.mark} regional [role]{.mark}
in defending strategic assets important to both
actors]{.underline}.\[164\] [With decreasing American military
engagement in the region, a process accelerated during the Trump
administration, China may find it difficult to be detached from the
MENA's conflicts]{.underline}.\[165\] The UAE and Saudi Arabia, for
example, are growing concerned that nuclear negotiations between Iran
and the US could bolster the Islamic Republic's assertiveness, or
alternatively cause America to entirely abandon the cause. Either way,
these sentiments have the potential to propel states to form
strengthened military ties with Beijing, which include hosting its
military and naval bases in their territories.\[166\] Gulf countries
recognize that China seeks to increase its involvement with the region,
and that its wish to protect energy and security assets would only drive
it to military advancement in the MENA.\[167\] Overall, it remains
unknown how the surmounting challenges China has confronted the US with
over recent years, and particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, would
manifest in the Middle East. [Nevertheless, it appears that China and
MENA countries are growing inextricably closer, in ways which may
necessitate a re-engagement of the US in a region it has long sought to
gradually withdraw from.\[168\] [China's rising need]{.mark} to secure
energy and strategic assets in the region [may]{.mark} eventually
[necessitate]{.mark} that [it mires itself in]{.mark} the [geopolitical
conflicts]{.mark} of the Middle East.]{.underline} **[If that is to
happen, [there might be little choice for the US but]{.mark} [to find
new ways to reestablish]{.mark} its military and political
[dominance]{.mark} over the region, even [at the cost of turning]{.mark}
the [MENA]{.mark} [into a great-power]{.mark} rivalry

["New Value Together" was the slogan for the 40th annual GITEX
Technology Week]{.underline}, the only in-person global technology show
of 2020 held December 6 to 10 at the Dubai World Trade Center. [Its
[organizer]{.mark} is known [across]{.mark} [the Middle East]{.mark} --
particularly the GCC countries -- **as the region's [leader in
5G]{.mark} and [cloud computing: Huawei]{.mark}**.]{.underline} [The
global telecoms supplier and mobile phone manufacturer made headlines
throughout 2020 -- most recently in Southeast Asia with a blitz of deals
monopolizing Indonesia's 5G network -- for its role in a growing global
5G movement. **Eleven telecom firms including those in the Gulf
Cooperation countries (GCC) of the [UAE]{.mark}, [Saudi]{.mark} Arabia,
[Bahrain]{.mark}, [Kuwait]{.mark}, and [Oman]{.mark} have
[signed]{.mark} [massive 5G contracts]{.mark} with Huawei over the last
year**]{.underline}. [By 2025, GCC countries will house much of the
world's growing 5G subscribers. Huawei has jumped on the bandwagon to
capitalize on what they perceive as a promising future for 5G in the
Middle East. The [company's leadership has been bullish]{.mark} on the
Middle East [since]{.mark} September [2019]{.mark}.]{.underline} And the
region's \$164 billion annual market for information and communication
technology (ICT) products is a good reason for Huawei's enthusiasm. Over
the last year, there has been a surge in publicly administered cloud
services in the Gulf worth nearly \$3 billion. This Gulf government-led
push is confirming for Huawei that 5G-enabled cloud computing in the GCC
is an increasingly lucrative market. But what impact has this recent
growth in 5G had on the everyday lives of the 54 million people living
in the GCC? Not much. Locally, 5G is mostly being implemented widely
only insofar as to enable a more rapid pace of downloads to smartphones
and quicker analog communications. As of December 1, Huawei's new P40
PRO 5G phone is available for consumer purchase in the UAE. But analysts
remain optimistic on the potential of 5G to positively impact multiple
industries in the GCC, specifically energy usage optimization, cloud
computing, ultrafast broadband, and internet of things (IoT) innovation,
including self-driving cars, transportation, and factory equipment. In
response, [Huawei has been [relentlessly extending]{.mark} its [digital
footprint]{.mark} across the Middle East despite Western efforts to
curtail its global expansion. The United States has repeatedly expressed
security concerns over Huawei's presence in international markets.
[Since 2018, U.S. policymakers have been]{.mark} actively [attempting to
hinder the]{.mark} [company]{.mark} and its China-side competitor ZTE's
expansion abroad, especially within the European Union. The Trump
administration's pressure on Huawei -- specifically its recent ploy to
curb critical semiconductor technology sales to the Chinese company --
has sparked global discussions about data privacy and security-related
drawbacks to international reliance on Huawei's toolkit. **While the
U.S. government's efforts to halt Huawei's expansion have succeeded
domestically and in parts of Europe, [the Gulf market has come out
unscathed]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [This is perhaps due to the region's
highly sensitive position in geopolitics. Given a heavy reliance on
China's oil market as well as the significant U.S. military and
diplomatic presence, there is no incentive for Gulf economies to become
a proxy war zone for the world's two largest superpowers. But
**[COVID-19 has made Gulf economies]{.mark} [increasingly reliant on
China]{.mark} as the nation's economy recovers faster than the United
States' from the global recession. Since COVID-19 restrictions lifted in
China, [Chinese policymakers have undertaken]{.mark} major [steps to
develop]{.mark} what they are calling "[industrial internet]{.mark}" of
global telecommunications providers at far cheaper prices than their
Western competitors in the sector**.]{.underline} Saudi Telecom Company
(STC) reported a jump of over 1,000 percent in bandwidth due to the
surge in remote education. They are currently scrambling to secure
necessary network infrastructure to keep pace with the demands of
Saudi's ambitious Vision 2030 strategy. Similarly, Qatar is preparing to
host in 2022 what it hopes will be the first 5G World Cup. The event's
reliance on a critical partnership between British telecom giant
Vodafone and Huawei may be jilted from the U.K.'s recent ban on Huawei
products, making the battle for 5G in the region over the next few years
ever more relevant. [Huawei's aforementioned growth in global 5G has
occupied much of the 2020 conversation on Chinese companies
[comprising]{.mark} China's Digital Silk Road ([DSR]{.mark}) initiative.
The phrase DSR was initially launched in a government white paper in
2015 as an [extension of]{.mark} China's Belt and Road Initiative
([BRI]{.mark}), a global strategy for Chinese-led infrastructure
development.]{.underline} Now the DSR is a widely used moniker for
Chinese data and telecoms activity abroad. According to Fudan
University, the DSR policy itself is comprised of five key aspects: with
infrastructure at its core, the DSR relies on expanding influence to
trade, finance, and "people's hearts," all geared toward shaping
policies abroad. These include cybersecurity, digital governance, and
data sharing practices across the developing world. Both the BRI and DSR
act in practice as catch-all monikers for economic and policy decisions
that Chinese government actors and corporations make. The ambiguity of
DSR's branding makes potentially disparate policies across many Chinese
companies -- each with varying levels of Chinese government involvement
-- look cohesive. Even within those companies China's hybridized
structure of state-owned and private enterprises makes top-level
decision-making incentives difficult for outsiders to disentangle. No
single company or government entity is totally emblematic of China's
DSR, even Huawei. [But U.S. 5G operations are still lagging behind that
of Asia in the Middle East. The Japan Center for Economic Research
predicts that given its performance in light of COVID-19, the Chinese
economy will surpass that of the United States before 2030**.
[With]{.mark} rollout of [5G in the U.S. lagging]{.mark} in pace

This paper explored the prospects of peace or war between the declining
United States and rising China. [**Many [scholars]{.mark}** of
international security and pundits **[believed]{.mark} that the [rise of
China would be conflictual]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Allison 2017;
Campbell 2008; Wang 2018). [**[On]{.mark} the
[contrary]{.mark}**,]{.underline} this paper argues that
[**[China]{.mark}** **[could surpass the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
as an economy**, [but]{.mark} there is **[no indication of armed
confrontation]{.mark} between the two nations**. This is because, in the
21st century, there are changing trends in international relations and
global politics.]{.underline} Besides, **[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}**
has not reached the stage of power maturity yet. Therefore, **[as
[rational]{.mark} state]{.underline}**, it [**would [not prematurely
plunge]{.mark} itself [into conflict with the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates**. Because the [outcome]{.mark} of armed confrontation
between China and the United States [will be a setback for]{.mark} the
world in general and particularly a bigger problem for [China]{.mark} at
this critical stage of her growth.]{.underline}

[More so, in today's world nations are intertwined by the forces of
globalisation which created inexorable **[economic
interdependence]{.mark}**, rapid advancement in **[military
tech]{.mark}nology**, and the concept of **Mutually Assured Destruction
([MAD]{.mark})** due to the advent and proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction. These factors have **[necessitated]{.mark} a
[revisit]{.mark} and a critical evaluation [of]{.mark} the [Power
Transition theory]{.mark}**]{.underline}, which was propounded in
mid-20th century [to make it applicable in the contemporary
international system.]{.underline}

Generally, the problem is that after World War II the new global order
was structured to serve the western powers while the rest of the world
was left out. Although China is a permanent member of the United Nation
Security Council, still, that will not be a fair share for rising China.
Thus, [if United States could act strategically to incorporate China
into the camp of nations that are getting a reasonable fair share of the
system through multilateral approaches, then the prospect of the
transition to be peaceful will increase]{.underline}. Though China is
not a liberal democracy, facilitating and accelerating the exposure of
China to the global norms and practices within the framework of
international law could make her less violent and moderately ambitious
during the transition. This strategy can let the two nations to have
some common interests of mutual benefit. Therefore, if China can benefit
from these norms and practices, then, challenging the established Pax
Americana status quo will be counterproductive. Zhu (2005) added that
**[[if the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [could accommodate]{.mark}
some of the significant [interests of]{.mark} [China]{.mark} the
[prospect of peaceful coexistence will increase]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
He, however, maintained that for the world to achieve this harmonious
transition, [the **[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [has to sacrifice
some]{.mark}** her interests and **[benefits]{.mark}** it has been
enjoying as the hegemon]{.underline}y. [This will finally create an
international atmosphere of cooperation and fair competition for a
better world.]{.underline}

All in all, Abramo Organski propounded the Power Transition theory in
the 20th century. Therefore, the definite assumption of the theory of
the escalation of armed confrontation during power transition might not
have substantial validity in the 21st century as a result of the nuclear
balance of terror, rapid advancement in military technology, and complex
economic interdependence brought about by the forces of globalisation.
Consequently, the **[[present-day]{.mark} Power Transition
[theorists]{.mark} [need to]{.mark} revisit the theory to
[accommodate]{.mark} [contemporary factors]{.mark} to make it fit
adequately in the discourse of international relations and global
politics of the 21st-century international system.]{.underline}**

3.3.Trade war as a Sign of Power Transition

According to power transition theory, war is possible if competing
countries have similar political, economic, and military capabilities
(Organski and Kugler, 1980). These relatively equal capabilities can
also be referred to as power parity, which is an important aspect that
determines the conditions during power transition (Zhu, 2006). The
United States and China are the world\'s two largest economies. U.S. GDP
grew from US\$19.485 trillion in 2017 to US\$20.529 trillion in 2018,
while China\'s GDP grew from US\$12.31 trillion to US\$13.895 trillion
over the same period (World Bank, 2021). This shows that the two
countries are approaching power parity (see Figure 3).

A hegemonic war is a war to determine which country will become the
dominant state to control the system (Gilpin, 1983). This potential for
this type of war between China and the U.S. is not only driven by power
parity, but also driven by the fact that China is a state that belongs
to the second type of national characteristics; that is, the powerful
and dissatisfied (Feng, 2009). According to the power transition theory,
if rising power identifies with this type, then transition is most
likely through war. Meanwhile, if the rising power comes from a state
that can be identified as the powerful and the satisfied, the power
transition period is more likely to be peaceful (Organski, 1958).

As mentioned before, China started its economic reforms in 1978 under
Deng Xiaoping. This wide-reaching financial reform means that [**[China
is]{.mark} currently [experiencing]{.mark} a [significant
economic]{.mark}** [rise]{.mark}, with its economy growing by an average
of 9.5 percent per year]{.underline} (Morrison, 2014). [In this period
of reform and industrialization, China is [seen to be **integrated
into**]{.mark} **the [current]{.mark} liberal [international]{.mark}**
[order]{.mark} by [joining]{.mark} several [international
organizations]{.mark}, such as WTO and the UN.]{.underline} However, in
the integration process, China often encounters problems with other
states due to differences in common international values, rules, and
norms with the country\'s internal domestic (Weinhardt and ten Brink,
2020). This leaves China involved in violations of international rules
and contestation influenced by its domestic preferences. Weinhardt and
ten Brink (2020) explained that two types of contestation are faced by
China: frame contestation (rules validity contestation) and claim
contestation (action contestation; rules violation).

In economic sectors dominated by state owned companies, such as steel,
China tends to break the rules and even question the rules\' validity.
In the steel sector, for example, China is involved in both frame
contestation and claim contestation because this sector is a crucial one
directly dominated by the state. Thus, it will be impossible for China
to pressure this sector to fully conform to WTO rules because they
contradict its domestic rules and preferences (ibid.).

In sectors that are quite important to the country but are not directly
dominated by the government, such as agriculture, China tends to bend
the rules to argue that they are not a developed country but a
developing country. China is involved in claim contestation in the
agricultural sector because it considers agriculture alleviates poverty
for small-scale farmers in areas that are not economically competitive,
thus increasing development indicators. China claims that the existing
rules are too focused on developed countries, so, according to China,
they are allowed to bend the rules to make them more suitable for
developing countries, including themselves (ibid.).

In a competitive sector like information and technology (IT), China
tends to comply fully with international rules (Yang and Qu, 2020). By
complying, China will become more developed in this sector and obtain
more opportunities and profits in the international market (Weinhardt
and ten Brink, 2020).

[With its growing economic might, [China appears]{.mark}]{.underline} to
have motivations [[to **replace the U.S. as a**]{.mark}
**[global]{.mark} [hegemon]{.mark}**. China\'s actions relating to
international trade signal its dissatisfaction with the current
international order, where China calls into question the order\'s
validity in several sectors, in line with their domestic
preferences.]{.underline}

China\'s motivation to replace the U.S. are [**[reflected in its global
initiatives]{.mark}**, [notably]{.mark} the Belt and Road Initiative
(**[BRI]{.mark}**).]{.underline} BRI is a Chineseled initiative to
promote connectivity and strengthen partnerships in Asia, Europe, and
Africa. [China is [trying to build **infrastructure**]{.mark} **to
[connect countries in the world]{.mark}** through sea and land routes
and increase trade traffic. Through this initiative, China]{.underline}
argues that it [seeks to build shared interest and responsibility
communities and promote cooperation in all fields.]{.underline} China
claims that BRI promotes mutual trust in politics, economic integration,
and cultural inclusiveness among the countries that are members (State
Council, PRC, 2015).

[The giant [BRI initiative]{.mark} is seen as Chinese statecraft that
will [help]{.mark} it to **[achieve its goals of expanding its global
influence]{.mark}** on politics and economy. At least two thirds of all
countries or around 139 countries in the world have joined this
initiative]{.underline} (Sacks, 2021). [China is also investing in port
development to support its objective to deepen trade links with the
world]{.underline} (Chatzky and McBride, 2020). However, despite
benefits such as improved infrastructure that can increase the rate of
global trade, the drawbacks of BRI could also be dangerous. For example,
China provides low-interest loans to states involved, and ultimately
these loans can leave countries deep in debt. In some cases, China even
requires the countries involved to use the services of Chinese companies
on local inftastrcutre initiatives instead of local companies (ibid.).

China\'s second global initiative is known as the Made in China 2025
Strategic Plan. In this plan, China aims that by 2025, they will have 70
percent self-sufficiency in the high-tech industry (ibid.). It will no
longer depend on other countries\' technology and will even be able to
promote Chinese high-tech producers in the global market. The aim is to
increase the productivity and efficiency of China\'s industries, in turn
boosting China\'s industries further and improving their economic
competitiveness (Sutter, 2020). The strategic plan, which inspired by
Germany\'s industrial 4.0 development plan, aims to catch China up with
the technological capabilities of the West and perhaps even to surpass
the capabilities of Western countries. However, the Chinese government
later re-framed the Made in China 2025 Strategic Plan as an aspirational
and unofficial one, following significant attention from leaders of
Western states, who judged the plan as demonstrating China\'s ambition
to become a global leader (McBride and Chatzky, 2020).

[In the military sector, China is also hying to [increase]{.mark} its
[defense power]{.mark} through various efforts.]{.underline} China
initiated a project entitled Civil Military Integration (CMI), intending
to harmonize its civil and defense technology development to achieve
efficiency, innovation, and growth. In addition, China has strengthened
the People\'s Liberation Army (PLA) through an array of training and
evaluation programs (Office of the Secretary of Defense, US, 2020).
[China is also noted to have increased its defense budget to maximize
and accelerate the development of its military capabilities, including
an increase in ownership of fighter jets, aircraft carriers, and
anti-satellite missiles, **[leading China to become]{.mark} the [country
with]{.mark} the world\'s [second-largest defense budget]{.mark},**
behind the United States]{.underline} (Funaiole et al., 2021).

The peace argument attempts to refute the war argument, especially
regarding further development of the China-threat theory articulated
mainly by advocates of offensive rea-ism. Sensing the danger, supporters
of this argument counter the Thucydides trap analogy by emphasizing
China's peaceful rise. ["[China]{.mark} [sees itself as]{.mark} a
[member of]{.mark} the [global community]{.mark} of common destiny. It
does not seek alliances or expansion. There is no cause for fear as
**China has neither the interest, nor the need, to challenge the United
States for leadership by launching a war.**"]{.underline}24 This
argument regards China as a responsible state committed to achieving its
own development without harming other states. It assumes that
[[economic]{.mark} [interdependence]{.mark} will [restrain China]{.mark}
-- the rising power -- [from confronting]{.mark} the [US]{.mark}, the
established power]{.underline}. Liberals argue that [interdependence is
one of the main pillars of peaceful international
relations.]{.underline} They also argue that [perpetual peace can
be]{.underline} partially [achieved by creating
interdependence]{.underline}. Liberals believe that [the more
interdependent states are, the more peaceful they will
become]{.underline}.25 [As such, **economic interdependence will [compel
China to become sensitive to]{.mark} the [costs of alienating]{.mark}
its economic [partners]{.mark}**, and to the small benefits afforded by
aggressive military postures relative to the larger benefits associated
with trade and financial interdependence.]{.underline} This argument has
been posited by a number of scholars. Ikenberry argues that [**[China's
rise will be peaceful]{.mark}** because **China is benefiting from the
current international system, as it is [rising by working inside]{.mark}
the [international institutions]{.mark}** such as the UN, WTO, IMF and
World Bank]{.underline},26 and [it is greatly [benefiting from]{.mark}
the current [l]{.mark}iberal [i]{.mark}nternational
[o]{.mark}rder]{.underline}.27 Bi-jian argues that China's rise to
great-power status will not result from following "the path of Germany
leading up to World War I or those \[paths\] of Germany and Japan
leading up to WWII, when these countries violently plundered resources
and pursued hegemony. [China will also not follow the path of the great
powers vying for global domination during the Cold War. [China
will]{.mark} instead, **[transcend ideological differences]{.mark}** to
strive for peace, development, and cooperation with all countries of the
world]{.underline}."28 Gill similarly argued in his book, Rising Star,
that [**China is [applying]{.mark} a** [**new security concept that**
**stresses cooperation**]{.mark} **among states in their pursuit of
common objectives**. China will rise peacefully and play a positive role
in building a harmonious region and world]{.underline}.29 In accordance
with this argument, China will help to stabilize the region. Bingguo
also stressed that China will "stick to the path of peaceful
development" and "will not engage in invasion, plundering, war, or
expansion." [It is by making others feel safe that China's security can
be achieved]{.underline}.30The capitalist peace theory argues that
trade, investments and financial openness reduce the risk of war.31
Countries are less likely to have military disputes if there is a
greater degree of economic cooperation among them. Weede favored this
theory in explaining China's rise. He discovered that ["[China's
positive response to]{.mark} the opportunity of exploiting its
comparative advantages within a [global market]{.mark} \...
[demonstrate]{.mark}\[s\] that a **[capitalist peace between
China]{.mark} and the [West is feasible]{.mark}**."]{.underline}32 [The
**deepening economic relations between the US and China have increased
the interdependency level** among the two powers further minimizing the
possibility of a violent confrontation. [Bilateral trade]{.mark} reached
[\$560 billion]{.mark} in 2020, in which China enjoys a huge trade
surplus of about \$311 billion.]{.underline}33 [More than \$60 billion
in direct investment flowed between the two states in
2016.34Additionally, [China holds]{.mark} over [\$1.1 trillion in US
treasury bonds]{.mark}]{.underline}.35 [This makes **China the US's
largest foreign creditor**. American investments and technologies are
crucial to China's development, and the American market is very
important for Chinese goods. In other words, the two economies
complement each other's needs]{.underline}. [While the US produces
high-tech products, China mostly produces products that meet the needs
of average consumers such as electrical machinery, furniture, toys,
sport equipment and food products. Therefore, in this sense, the
relationship is not one of competitors but of counterparts. Thus, **[any
decision to move toward]{.mark} a military [confrontation]{.mark} [would
undermine]{.mark} the [economies of both countries]{.mark}**. This
**would [cause]{.mark} [great]{.mark} economic and political [pain to
China]{.mark}, whose political [regime depends on]{.mark} its [capacity
to provide]{.mark} [better economic]{.mark} and [social conditions for
its massive population]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Building a wealthy,
strong, and civilized social country with Chinese characteristics, is
the main theme of Deng Xiaoping's theory of development, and Xi
Jinping's idea of development.36 To achieve this objective, [China will
need peaceful and cooperative international relationships, principally
with the US. China is benefiting from the existing international system
in building a vibrant economy that has lifted mil-lions of its citizens
out of poverty and legitimized the ruling Chinese Communist Party in a
post-Communist world. There is no reason for [China]{.mark} to destroy
this system. Instead, it [must capitalize on]{.mark} the existing
[international system]{.mark} [of trade]{.mark}, investment,
[tech]{.mark}nology, and [security]{.mark}. That does not mean that
China will not work to adjust some existing norms to advance its
development.]{.underline} This is particularly evidenced by China's
efforts to establish the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank to advance
its Belt and Road Initiative and properly to counter the US-led World
Bank and the US/Japan-led Asian Development Bank. The same motivation of
challenging the US-led status quo has led China to launch the ambitious
Belt and Road Initiative, which aims at creating a new system based on
Chinese principles while working in parallel with the US-dominated
system. Similarly, the 2013 Carnegie Foundation Report that assessed
US-Japan-China relations argued against a full-scale military
confrontation by China intent upon expelling the US from that region.
Instead, the report concluded that the economic interdependence among
the three countries would motivate them to resolve their disputes
peacefully.37Jerden and Hagstrom noted that China's rise has been
accommodated, rather than balanced against it,by Japan.38 Steinfeld has
argued that China's rise does not constitute a threat to the West
because it is deeply involved in international economic systems that
have been created and defined by the West.39 Therefore, the [[tensions
are manageable]{.underline}]{.mark}. Yang opposes [the [war
argument]{.mark}]{.underline} and asserts that it [is [overruled by
nuclear deterrence]{.mark} and [geographical]{.mark}
[constraints]{.mark}]{.underline}. He believes that [mutual nuclear
deterrence makes "China's rise different from previous examples of
violent rising of great powers and this difference explains the
peacefulness of China as a rising great power."]{.underline}40 Dellios
and Ferguson argue thar [**[China has good intentions]{.mark}** to
achieve harmonious world by becoming a responsible
state]{.underline}.[41]{.underline}

[Another major factor contributing to China's peaceful rise is that the
**[US faces]{.mark} many [global challenges]{.mark} that
[necessitate]{.mark} [cooperation with]{.mark} many [leading powers,
including China]{.mark}**. **[Terror]{.mark}ism, [nuclear]{.mark}
[prolif]{.mark}eration, [climate change]{.mark}, [trade]{.mark} and
[pandemics]{.mark} are issues of [significant importance to both
powers]{.mark}**, thereby providing additional **[impetus to maintaining
cordial relations]{.mark}**. [China]{.mark} [may not provide
full]{.mark} [cooperation]{.mark} on these issues, [but]{.mark} its
**[non-collaboration could make things more difficult]{.mark}**.
Meanwhile, **[China understands]{.mark} that [global problems cannot be
resolved without US involvement]{.mark}** since it is the only power
capable of providing global public goods]{.underline}. For example,
[China realizes that [it is in its own interest to cooperate]{.mark}
with the US on the war on terror]{.underline} [in order to secure its
oil supply]{.underline} and deny support for Muslim extremist groups in
China. Furthermore, China is not yet a military superpower, thereby
favoring its peaceful rise. [Its omnidirectional capabilities will not
allow it to win a military confrontation against the US.]{.underline}
Globally, the balance of power still tilts in favor of the US, which has
about 800 military bases around the world, including two major bases in
Japan and South Korea. Aditionally, China has only one officially
recognized overseas military base that was opened in Djibouti in 2017.
It has a space station manned by the People's Liberation Army in
Argentina, and unconfirmed military presence in Tajikistan and Cambodia.
China's capacity to project power effectively in places far away from
its territory is therefore limited. Some even think that China does not
have the capability to conquer Taiwan because of Taiwan's advanced
military capabilities and a possible US intervention, which could
inflict political, economic and military damage on China.42 Furthermore,
East Asian states have not submitted to China and have shown the resolve
to resist if threatened by China.43Shambaugh described China as a
partial power, or one that lacks real global hard and soft powers
compared to the US, although this is changing. According to him, China
is no match for the US' comprehensive global influence and power as
evident in its unmatched hard and soft power.44 China is unlikely to
confront the US militarily until its military power overtakes the
latter. This is manifested in China's improvements in its
military-to-military ties with the US, undertaken to reduce the risk of
US misconceptions about China's strategic military and security
intentions.45 [However, [this does not mean]{.mark} that [China will not
continue to enhance its military]{.mark} capabilities and challenge the
US politically. This attitude is evidenced by its ongoing assertive
policies in East Asia with regard to its territorial claims, and its
efforts to establish a security presence in places along the Belt and
Road Initiative, particularly in Central and South Asia. Although,
[there are]{.mark} several of [contentious issues]{.mark} between China
and the US that borders on their respective national security interests,
[none seem so unamendable to diplomatic]{.mark} or peaceful
[resolution]{.mark} to trigger a rising China to wage war against the
United States.]{.underline} Al-though Fearon acknowledges "issue
indivisibilities," whereby certain national security interests are so
paramount that that they are not easily amendable to bargaining, war is
not always inevitable.46 Fearon argues that [due to the complexities of
issues that States bargain over in international relations, **side
payments and issue linkages are possible in averting war**.]{.underline}
Fearon adds that "War-prone international issues may often be
effectively indivisible, but the cause of this indivisibility lies in
domestic political and other mechanisms rather than in the nature of the
issues themselves."4

#### China will adjust to international norms, prevents hegemonic transition wars

The fourth factor that is likely to lead to
**[[China's]{.underline}]{.mark}** partial peaceful rise is the fact
that its **[[rise]{.mark} is [occurring in]{.mark} an [international
political arena governed by norms]{.mark} and international
organizations]{.underline} [that have largely been [successful
at]{.mark} [serving as buffers against hegemonic
wars]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.underline} Indeed, [the aforementioned
avenues have created an [enabling environment for]{.mark} potential
[antagonists to]{.mark} fraternize and [cooperate]{.mark} on a plethora
of mutually beneficial issues, thereby [diminishing]{.mark} the
[prospects of violent confrontations]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Politically
and economically, **[China]{.mark} has [shown]{.mark} the [proclivity
toward participating]{.mark} and working with[in]{.mark}
[international]{.mark}** [**organizations**]{.mark} dominated by the US
in order to achieve its interests]{.underline}. [It is instructive to
know that China, as a permanent member of the UN Security Council, is a
major beneficiary of a hegemonic arrangement that confers veto power on
itself and four other great powers]{.underline}. [In a peaceful rise,
the [r**ising power accommodates**]{.mark} **itself to the rules and
structures of international society**, while at the same time, [other
great powers]{.mark} accommodate some changes in those rules and
structures by way of [adjust]{.mark}ing to the [new disposition of
power]{.mark} and status]{.underline}. [[But **if this is not
happening**]{.mark}**, then the [rising power moves to]{.mark} a
[partial peaceful rise]{.mark} where an environment of suspicion starts
to build up.** Consequently, the rising power [will not hesitate to
use]{.mark} its [capabilities]{.mark} to challenge some aspects of the
established international system, particularly on issues that it deems
inimical to its strategic interests and foreign policy priorities, but
**[without getting itself in great]{.mark} [war]{.mark}**. This is
evidenced by China's vetoing of US-backed UN resolutions]{.underline}
calling for sanctions against Bashar Assad for Chemical Weapons usage,
and also in their shielding of the Burmese regime from any
accountability for its human rights abuses against the Rohyngya people.
[In the economic arena, China's willingness to undertake a long list
of]{.underline} reforms as a condition of admission into the US-led
World Trade Organization in 2011 [is a testament to China's recognition
of the importance of international organizations to its foreign policy
goals. Besides **[China]{.mark} [demonstrating a willingness to]{.mark}
[work in US-dominated]{.mark} international [organizations]{.mark} for
its benefits, it [has not departed from]{.mark} initiating [its
own]{.mark} [Chinese-dominated]{.mark} international
[organizations]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This is evidenced by its role in
the creation of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank in 2015 to
which it provided \$50 billion of the bank's \$100 billion seed money.
Similarly, China was a major advocate of the establishment of the New
Development Bank in 2015, which involves the BRICS States made up of
Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. China contributed \$41
billion toward its initial capitalization. Such multilateral economic
initiatives, coupled with Chinese massive bilateral trade arrangements,
financial assistance and infrastructure funding around the world, has
given rise to what experts now refer to as the "Beijing Consensus." The
latter has now become a competing alternative to the US-led neoliberal
economic ideology dubbed the "Washington Consensus."

CENTRIFUGAL FORCES

Another important shift marks a break from the post--Cold War unipolar
moment. [The **[transnational]{.mark} civil society [networks]{.mark}**
that [stitched together]{.mark} the [l]{.mark}iberal
[i]{.mark}nternational [o]{.mark}rder **[no longer enjoy]{.mark} the
power and [influence]{.mark} [they once had]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}
**[Illiberal competitors]{.mark} now [challenge them]{.mark}** in many
areas, including [gender]{.mark} rights, [multiculturalism]{.mark}, and
the [principles of liberal]{.mark} democratic [governance]{.mark}. Some
of these centrifugal forces have **originated in the** **United States**
and western European countries themselves]{.underline}. For instance,
the U.S. lobbying group the National Rifle Association worked
transnationally to successfully defeat a proposed antigun referendum in
Brazil in 2005, where it built an alliance with domestic right-wing
political movements; over a decade later, the Brazilian political
firebrand Jair Bolsonaro tapped into this same network to help propel
himself to the presidency. The World Congress of Families, initially
founded by U.S.-based Christian organizations in 1997, is now a
transnational network, supported by Eurasian oligarchs, that convenes
prominent social conservatives from dozens of countries to build global
opposition to LGBTQ and reproductive rights.

Autocratic regimes have found ways to limit---or even eliminate---the
influence of liberal transnational advocacy networks and reform-minded
NGOs. The so-called color revolutions in the post-Soviet world in the
first decade of this century and the 2010--11 Arab Spring in the Middle
East played a key role in this process. They alarmed authoritarian and
illiberal governments, which increasingly saw the protection of human
rights and the promotion of democracy as threats to their survival. In
response, such regimes curtailed the influence of NGOs with foreign
connections. They imposed tight restrictions on receiving foreign funds,
proscribed various political activities, and labeled certain activists
"foreign agents."

Some governments now sponsor their own NGOs both to suppress
liberalizing pressures at home and to contest the liberal order abroad.
For example, in response to Western support of young activists during
the color revolutions, the Kremlin founded the youth group Nashi to
mobilize young people in support of the state. The Red Cross Society of
China, China's oldest government-organized NGO, has delivered medical
supplies to European countries in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic as
part of a carefully orchestrated public relations campaign. These
regimes also use digital platforms and social media to disrupt
antigovernment mobilization and advocacy. Russia has likewise deployed
such tools abroad in its information operations and electoral meddling
in democratic states.

[[Some]{.mark} of the [forces]{.mark} **driving the unraveling of the
liberal order have [originated in the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
itself**.]{.underline}

Two developments helped accelerate the illiberal turn in the West: the
Great Recession of 2008 and the refugee crisis in Europe in 2015. [Over
the last decade, **[illiberal networks]{.mark}**---generally but not
exclusively on the right---have **[challenged]{.mark} the [establishment
consensus]{.mark} within the West**. Some groups and figures
**[question]{.mark} the [merits of]{.mark} continued [membership
in]{.mark}** major institutions of the [liberal]{.mark} [order]{.mark},
such as the European Union and **[NATO]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Many
right-wing movements in the West receive both financial and moral
support from Moscow, which backs "dark money" operations that promote
narrow oligarchic interests in the United States and far-right political
parties in Europe with the hope of weakening democratic governments and
cultivating future allies. In Italy, the anti-immigrant party Lega is
currently the most popular party despite revelations of its attempt to
win illegal financial support from Moscow. In France, the National
Rally, which also has a history of Russian backing, remains a powerful
force in domestic politics.

[These developments **[echo]{.mark} the [ways in which "counter-order"
movements]{.mark}** have **[helped precipitate]{.mark} the [decline of
hegemonic powers in the past]{.mark}**. Transnational networks played
crucial roles in both upholding and challenging prior international
orders.]{.underline} For example, Protestant networks helped erode
Spanish power in early modern Europe, most notably by supporting the
Dutch Revolt in the sixteenth century. Liberal and republican movements,
especially in the context of the revolutions across Europe in 1848,
played a part in undermining the Concert of Europe, which tried to
manage international order on the continent in the first half of the
nineteenth century. The rise of fascist and communist transnational
networks helped produce the global power struggle of World War II.
[Counter-order movements [achieved]{.mark} political
[power]{.mark}]{.underline} in countries such as Germany, Italy, and
Japan[, [leading]{.mark} those [nations to break from]{.mark} or try to
assail [existing structures]{.mark} of international order. But **[even
less successful]{.mark} counter-order [movements]{.mark}** can still
**[undermine]{.mark} the [cohesion]{.mark} of hegemonic powers and their
allies**.]{.underline}

[**Not every illiberal or right-wing movement that opposes the U.S.-led
order seeks to challenge U.S. leadership** or turns to Russia as an
exemplar of strong cultural conservatism. Nonetheless, such **movements
are [helping polarize politics]{.mark} [in advanced industrial
democracies]{.mark} and [weaken support for]{.mark} the order's
[institutions]{.mark}.** One of them has even captured the White House:
**[Trumpism]{.mark}, which is best understood as a counter-order
movement with a transnational reach that [targets]{.mark} the [alliances
and partnerships central to U.S. hegemony]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

CONSERVING THE U.S. SYSTEM

[**[Great-power contestation]{.mark}**, the **[end of]{.mark} the
[West's monopoly on patronage]{.mark}**, and the **emergence of
[movements]{.mark} that [oppose]{.mark} the [liberal international
system]{.mark}** have all altered the global order over which Washington
has presided since the end of the Cold War. In many respects, the
**[COVID-19 pandemic]{.mark}** seems to be further [accelerating]{.mark}
the **[erosion of U.S. heg]{.mark}emony**]{.underline}. China has
increased its influence in the World Health Organization and other
global institutions in the wake of the Trump administration's attempts
to defund and scapegoat the public health body. [**Beijing and Moscow**
are portraying themselves as **providers of emergency goods** and
medical supplies, including to European countries such as Italy, Serbia,
and Spain, and even to the United States.]{.underline} Illiberal
governments worldwide are using the pandemic as cover for restricting
media freedom and cracking down on political opposition and civil
society. [[Although]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [still
enjoys **military**]{.mark} **[supremacy]{.mark}**, [that]{.mark}
dimension of U.S. dominance [is]{.mark} especially **[ill suited to deal
with this global]{.mark} [crisis]{.mark}** and its ripple
effects.]{.underline}

[**[Even if]{.mark} the [core]{.mark} of the U.S. hegemonic
system**---which consists mostly of long-standing Asian and European
allies and rests on norms and institutions developed during the Cold
War---**[remains robust]{.mark}**, and even if, as many champions of the
liberal order suggest will happen, the United States and the European
Union can leverage their combined economic and military might to their
advantage, the fact is that **Washington will have to get used to an
increasingly contested and complex international order**. There is no
easy fix for this. **[No amount of military spending can
reverse]{.mark}** the processes driving the **[unraveling]{.mark} of
U.S. [heg]{.mark}emony**. Even if Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic
nominee, knocks out Trump in the presidential election later this year,
or if the Republican Party repudiates Trumpism, the disintegration will
continue.]{.underline}

The key questions now concern how far the unraveling will spread. Will
core allies decouple from the U.S. hegemonic system? How long, and to
what extent, can the United States maintain financial and monetary
dominance? The most favorable outcome will require a clear repudiation
of Trumpism in the United States and a commitment to rebuild liberal
democratic institutions in the core. At both the domestic and the
international level, such efforts will necessitate alliances among
center-right, center-left, and progressive political parties and
networks.

**[What [U.S. policymakers]{.mark} can do is plan for the world after
global hegemony]{.underline}**. If they help preserve the core of the
American system, U.S. officials can ensure that the United States leads
the strongest military and economic coalition in a world of multiple
centers of power, [rather than finding itself on the losing side of most
contests over the shape of the new international order.]{.underline} To
this end, the United States should reinvigorate the beleaguered and
understaffed State Department, rebuilding and more effectively using its
diplomatic resources. Smart statecraft will allow a great power to
navigate a world defined by competing interests and shifting alliances.

[U.S. policymakers [must plan for the world after global
hegemony]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[**The [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [lacks]{.mark} both the
[will]{.mark} and the [resources to consistently outbid China]{.mark}
and other emerging powers** for the allegiance of governments. It will
be **[impossible to secure]{.mark} the [commitment of some]{.mark}
[countries]{.mark}** to U.S. visions of international order.
[Many]{.mark} of those **[governments]{.mark} have come to [view]{.mark}
the [U.S.-led order as]{.mark} a [threat to]{.mark} their autonomy**, if
not their [survival]{.mark}. And some governments that still welcome a
U.S.-led liberal order now contend with populist and other illiberal
movements that oppose it.]{.underline}

[Even at the peak of the unipolar moment, Washington did not always get
its way.]{.underline} Now, for the U.S. political and economic model to
retain considerable appeal, the United States has to first get its own
house in order. China will face its own obstacles in producing an
alternative system; Beijing may irk partners and clients with its
pressure tactics and its opaque and often corrupt deals. A reinvigorated
U.S. foreign policy apparatus should be able to exercise significant
influence on international order even in the absence of global hegemony.
But to succeed, [[Washington must recognize]{.mark} that the world no
longer resembles the historically anomalous period of the 1990s and the
first decade of this century. **The [unipolar moment]{.mark} has passed,
and it [isn't coming back.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

For the United States, imposing tariffs on trade with China was
justified by argument that the U.S. was attempting their trade deficit.
Moreover, the United States considered that China was using illegal and
unfair trade practices to acquire U.S. technology and was failing to
protect intellectual property rights, in addition to attempting to
weaken U.S. national security and international status (Lai, 2019; Liu
and Woo, 2018). For example, China was seen to conduct unfair trade
practices by providing subsidies to Chinese companies to sell
commodities at lower prices. Thus, besides aiming to fix U.S. trade
deficit, this measure was also seen as a financial \'fine\' for China.
On the other hand, through the lens of the power transition theory,
increased tariffs can also be seen as a preventive measure that the
United States considers capable of containing China\'s economic rise and
increased influence.

[The current **[U.S.-China trade war indicates]{.mark}** that the
**[world is]{.mark}** potentially **[in a]{.mark}**]{.underline}
not-peaceful **[[power transition]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [The
**[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates as a hegemon [feels]{.mark} the [need
to implement]{.mark} a [preventive war]{.mark}** (in this case, a trade
war in the form of increasing tariffs on China\'s products) so that
China\'s economic growth can be limited.]{.underline} However, this
action is a measure of protectionism that violates the WTO rules (CNBC,
15th September 2020). [As a rising power and the world\'s second-largest
economy, **China feels capable of fighting back** against the U.S. by
increasing tariffs for American products. This reciprocal action
occurred in several rounds, until finally, the two states were involved
in a trade war that has had far-reaching effects on the global economy
as a whole.]{.underline}

As can be seen from World Bank data, global economic growth in 2019 only
reached 2.6 percent, the lowest figure since 2008, despite projections
of 3.3 percent (World Bank, 2019). This decline in the global economic
growth rate has the potential to significantly disrupt global financial
stability. In fact, global economic stability is one of the
international public goods that the United States as a hegemon should
fulfill.

The United States claims that the cheap Chinese products and its trade
deficit with China are hurting local firms and causing reduced
employment opportunities in the U.S. The U.S. argument is that an
increase in price will cause a drop in consumer interest in Chinese-made
products, instead causing them to turn towards local products. Thus,
this policy is also seen as a protectionist measure by the United States
for their local companies and workers.

The introduction of higher tariffs by the U.S. was followed by its
withdrawal from several international agreements and organizations, such
as the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP), the Iran Nuclear Deal, the Paris
Agreement, the U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization
(UNESCO), and the U.N. Human Rights Council (Narine, 2018; Wolfe, 2018;
Zhang et al., 2017). The Trump administration saw these schemes as
detrimental to the U.S. because many countries became \'free riders\',
even though these international schemes are formed based on liberal
values, which the U.S. tends to promote globally (Karim, 2020).

[The **[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates\' [withdrawal]{.mark}
[from]{.mark} various [international organizations]{.mark}** and
agreements [illustrates]{.mark} its **[reluctance to provide]{.mark}
international [public goods]{.mark}** as the hegemon.]{.underline}
According to Ikenberry and Nexon (2019), [to create stability, the
**international system needs a country that is willing and able to act
as a quasi-intemational government and provides public goods for the
international community** by mobilizing their resources, both economic
and military. Through this explanation, it can be concluded that a
hegemon must be willing to make sacrifices to mobilize its resources to
create public goods and create international stability. The trade war
started by the U.S. has the potential to disrupt one of these public
goods - global economic stability - because of the trade war\'s
extremely broad impact on the decline in global economic growth as a
whole.]{.underline}

[The **United States has thus abandoned its role as the provider of
public goods and has [turned into]{.mark} a [consumer]{.mark} of public
goods**]{.underline} (Zhang et al., 2017). International organizations
and agreements can facilitate cooperation between countries to produce
public goods in international policies. Collaboration between countries
can also create complex interdependence between countries that are
needed to maintain international peace, security, and stability, which
are also a part of international public goods. In the context of
international trade, the United States\' withdrawal from the TPP can be
seen as a decrease in their commitment to promoting free trade in the
international system. According to the United States, the TPP did not
benefit them; in fact, it caused losses (Narine, 2018). [With this, it
can be seen that the U.S., as a hegemon, refuses to devote its resources
to providing international public goods to create free trade. This
**[decline in]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates\' [role
can]{.mark} ultimately [be seen as]{.mark} a [decline in]{.mark}
[US]{.mark} global [heg]{.mark}emony.**]{.underline}

[**[China has]{.mark} so far [responded]{.mark} to the decline in U.S.
hegemony [by using]{.mark} its [position]{.mark} as a rising power and
[taking]{.mark} an [active role in]{.mark} the [international
system]{.mark}**. In the [U]{.mark}nited [N]{.mark}ations Human Rights
Council, which under Trump was [abandoned by]{.mark} the [U.S.,
China]{.mark} seemingly [took]{.mark} an important [role in promoting
human rights]{.mark}, which are one of the essential values of the
liberal world order]{.underline} (Cooley and Nexon, 2020). [In addition,
[China]{.mark} has [shown]{.mark} its [significant influence]{.mark} in
the international health sector by [becoming]{.mark} a [provider of
health goods]{.mark} for other countries while facing the COVID-19
pandemic. This [contrasts with]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates\' decision to cut off funding to the World Health
Organization (WHO) because the US considers China to have dominant
influence over the organization]{.underline} (The BMJ, 1st June 2020).

[The [decline in U.S. heg]{.mark}emony and [China\'s increasing role
shows]{.mark} that the [world is indeed in a power transition]{.mark}
period, [though]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates itself has
[tried to maintain]{.mark} its [position]{.mark} as a global leader by
attempting to suppress China\'s rise through the implementation of a
trade war. By understanding the conditions explained above, **we can see
that the [international system\'s power transition is
inevitable]{.mark}**. As a rising power, China seeks to be in the
dominant position in the system, which can be seen in their global
initiatives. The United States, as the current hegemon, tries to hold
China\'s economic rise by imposing tariffs on its trade with China
before China gets too strong to contain. This later became a trade war.
In addition, the fact that the United States\' global influence is
declining while that of China is increasing, **further triggers the
power transition**.]{.underline}

#### Loss of European confidence hamper effectiveness at containing China's rise 

**Krastev & Leonard 21** -- Ivan Krastev, chair of the Centre for
Liberal Strategies, Sofia, and a permanent fellow at the Institute for
Human Sciences in Vienna, & Mark Leonard, co-founder and director of the
European Council on Foreign Relations ("The crisis of America power: How
Europeans see Biden's America, 1/19/2021,
[[https://ecfr.eu/publication/the-crisis-of-american-power-how-europeans-see-bidens-america/]{.underline}](https://ecfr.eu/publication/the-crisis-of-american-power-how-europeans-see-bidens-america/))

**[Most [Europeans' view]{.mark} of [America as politically
broken]{.mark} and [likely to]{.mark} soon [be overtaken by
China]{.mark} as a global power appears to affect public perceptions of
the value of the transatlantic alliance in ways that could have a
significant impact on the Biden team.]{.underline}** We noticed four
profound changes. Firstly, the move towards greater self-reliance. One
of the most striking findings of ECFR's survey is that [at least 60 per
cent of [respondents]{.mark} in every surveyed country -- and an average
of 67 per across all these countries -- [believe]{.mark} that [they
cannot]{.mark} always [rely on the US to defend]{.mark} them and,
therefore, need to invest in European defence.]{.underline}
Interestingly, 74 per cent of British respondents hold this view -- a
higher share than in any other national group. ECFR's opinion poll also
reveals a change in threat perceptions across Europe, most dramatically
in Germany. During the cold war, Germany felt threatened by invasion and
was, therefore, wedded to the Atlantic alliance. But, nowadays, Germans
seem to have caught up with the French (whose country has the strongest
military in the EU and is a long-time proponent of European defence
integration) in feeling less of a need than other Europeans for the US
security guarantee. Currently, only 10 per cent of respondents in France
and Germany say that their country needs the American security guarantee
"a great deal" to be safe from military invasion. Only in Poland do a
substantial number of respondents (44 per cent) believe that they need
this guarantee "a great deal[". Therefore, it seems that Germany's --
and Europe's -- transatlantic policy in the years to come could be
influenced not only by the country's increasing economic ties with China
but also by the fact that over half of the German public does not now
see US military power as an existential guarantee of its
security.]{.underline} The second big surprise is around the question of
geopolitical alignment. [[Biden]{.mark} has [called for]{.mark} the [US
and Europe to form a united]{.mark} [front against China]{.mark} and
thereby shape its rise. [But]{.mark}]{.underline} ECFR's poll shows
that, [[in]{.mark} today's [Europe]{.mark}, [there is no dream of a
return to a bipolar world]{.mark} in which the West would face off
against China and its allies as it once did against the Soviet Union.
**[Troubled by]{.mark} doubts about America and influenced by
[Trump]{.mark}'s focus on narrowly defined national interests**,
European voters have started to think differently about the nature of
the transatlantic alliance.]{.underline} In 2019 ECFR conducted a
pan-European poll that indicated that a large majority of respondents in
all surveyed countries wanted to remain neutral (rather than align with
Washington) in a conflict between the US and China or Russia.
[[Many]{.mark} [people around Biden]{.mark} may have [hoped]{.mark} that
[his victory]{.mark} in the November election [would have changed that
dynamic]{.mark}. They may have assumed that Europeans' shift towards
neutrality could be explained by their mistrust of, and disgust with,
Trump.]{.underline} [[However]{.underline}]{.mark}, ECFR's latest poll
shows that [[political change in Washington does not appear]{.mark} to
have fundamentally [alter]{.mark}ed [respondents' calculus]{.mark} about
geopolitical alignment.]{.underline} At least half of the electorate in
every surveyed country would like their government to remain neutral in
a conflict between the US and China. This even applies in Denmark and
Poland, the two countries with the highest proportions of people who
would like to take the United States' side -- 35 per cent and 30 per
cent respectively. This may reflect the fact that, although both
Europeans and Americans are toughening up their approaches to China,
their long-term goals are somewhat different. While Americans want to do
so to decouple from and contain China, Europeans (above all Germans)
still hope to bring China back into the rules-based system. Europe's
unwillingness to side with the US also comes out in respondents' views
on a conflict between the US and Russia: in no surveyed country would a
majority want to take Washington's side. Amazingly, only 36 per cent of
respondents in Poland and 40 per cent in Denmark say that their country
should side with the US in such a scenario. Across the 11 surveyed
countries, just 23 per cent of respondents hold this view -- while 59
per cent want their country to remain neutral. In Denmark and Poland,
neutrality is the preferred option of 47 per cent and 45 per cent of
voters respectively. This shift in perceptions might have as much to do
with power as anything else. What Europeans love about the memory of
cold war 1.0 is that they were on the winning side; the fear in many
European countries is that cold war 2.0 might have a different outcome.
The growing mistrust about Washington's reliability and power is
changing the nature of the transatlantic alliance. America's cold war
coalitions took the form of a Catholic marriage. They were meant to be
monogamous, with no possibility of divorce. [After four years of Trump,
the alliance looks like a more casual arrangement -- an open marriage in
which bringing in other players is the key to not being exploited.
Europeans no longer trust America to defend Europe and would express
little solidarity with the US if it became involved in a conflict with
other great powers]{.underline}. Reading ECFR's survey, [Washington will
also have no reasons to trust European publics' readiness to conduct a
joint transatlantic foreign policy.]{.underline} The third consequence
of changing perceptions of power is a desire to be less sentimental in
dealings with the US. A perverse effect of Trump's term in power is
that, by ruthlessly focusing on the national interest, he has encouraged
other players -- including Europeans -- to concentrate more on
protecting their own interests at the expense of focusing on the broader
common interests of the democratic West. This is reflected in many
Europeans' desire to invest in defending themselves. There has also been
a marked change in how people regard the transatlantic economic
relationship. Among the eight countries in which ECFR asked voters about
this issue, pluralities in Germany (37 per cent), France (48 per cent),
Great Britain (37 per cent), and Italy (42 per cent) think that their
country should be tougher with the US on economic issues such as
international trade, the taxation of multinational companies, and the
regulation of digital platforms. Poland is the predictable outlier on
this point, with just one in ten voters saying that their country should
become tougher with the US on economic issues. This prevailing mistrust
is also changing the ways that Europeans relate to one another -- the
fourth big policy consequence that comes out of our poll. As they no
longer see Washington as a reliable partner, Europeans are looking to
one another more than they once did. This raises the issue of whether
Berlin will replace Washington as the 'go-to' capital. Given the size
and importance of the 'In Europe We Trust' group, it is not surprising
that respondents in France, Spain, Denmark, the Netherlands, Portugal,
and Hungary were most likely to choose Germany as the most important
country to build a good relationship with, above the US (while, for
their part, 38 per cent of Germans chose France as their most important
ally, and only 35 per cent preferred the US). Only respondents in Great
Britain (55 per cent), Poland (45 per cent), Italy (36 per cent), and
Sweden (36 per cent) are more likely to rank the US first over Germany
on this measure; but, in Sweden, an almost equal share, 35 per cent,
rank Germany above the US. [As he left office early in the twenty-first
century, Bill Clinton declared that the key task for Americans would be
"to create a world we would like to live in when we are no longer the
world's only superpower". It is fair to say that the US and Europe have
failed to do this]{.underline}. [As Biden enters the White House, the US
is no longer the only superpower.]{.underline} And the world he governs
in -- marked by the rise of authoritarian powers and the spread of
nationalism and inequality -- is not the one that either Americans or
Europeans would prefer to live in. Since the disastrous 2003 war in Iraq
and the 2008 global financial crisis, Washington has been facing up to
the end of the unipolar moment. Trump and his predecessor, Barack Obama,
are probably the most different American presidents one can imagine. But
their analyses of America's position in the world had much more in
common than most people recognise. Both of them understood that
America's ambition to remain the world's only superpower was
unsustainable. Both acknowledged the centrality of geo-economics in the
twenty-first century. And both recognised that they would need to work
with political regimes that did not share America's values and norms.
But their responses to this situation were strikingly different. Obama
was convinced that the best way to preserve America's leadership was to
embed Washington in a diverse and well-developed network of military and
trade alliances. This is why the Obama administration's negotiations on
the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership went hand in hand
with its quest to seal a Trans-Pacific Partnership. Obama hoped that, by
using these tools, America would gain the upper hand over China and
reinvent its role for the future. Trump's bet was that, if the
international order had stopped working for America, it was in
Washington's interest to act as the disrupter-in-chief and to organise
the world around asymmetrical bilateral relations with other powers.
While the US remains the most powerful country in the world, it can
still dictate terms to any other player -- providing them with deals one
at a time. While Obama believed that America's strength lay in its
networked alliances, Trump believed that they were chains that kept
America down. [The Biden administration is coming to power at a moment
when Trump's "America's First" policy has failed to provide Washington
with greater global influence, while a return to Obama's strategy is not
viewed as realistic because of America's unreliability and waning power.
A [majority]{.mark} of Europeans [doubt]{.mark} that [Biden can put
Humpty Dumpty back together]{.mark} again. Alliances are born of
interests and values but, like any other human relationship, they are
sustained or broken by the prevailing moods of the
partners.]{.underline} So, what does ECFR's new opinion poll reveal
about the future of the transatlantic relationship in the post-Trump
world? The good news is that there is widespread optimism among
Europeans after the 2020 US election that the transatlantic partnership
has a future. **[The bad news is that Europeans are [skeptical
about]{.mark} America's [efforts]{.mark} [to]{.mark} regain its
influence and [contain]{.mark} the rise of
[China]{.mark}.]{.underline}** "Without the Cold War, what's the point
of being an American?", Harry "Rabbit" Angstrom, the novelist John
Updike's late-twentieth-century everyman, asked as the "long twilight
struggle" was winding down. Many people in America now see the prospect
of a new cold war as giving their foreign policy a new focus. But
Europeans are asking themselves exactly the opposite question: "what is
the point of being a European if the cold war has returned?". The
perspective of a new cold war with China is deeply unattractive to the
Europeans we surveyed. It is not that Europeans are pro-China. A
previous ECFR poll has shown that Europeans are not attracted by the
Chinese model, and the pandemic has made clear China's hegemonic
ambitions. But Europeans appear keen to forge their own path rather than
fall into line behind America's China policy. The largest number of
those surveyed in this and previous polls seem to support the idea of a
more sovereign and autonomous Europe. However, while European leaders
tend to view European sovereignty as reflecting a desire to play a more
important role in global politics -- regardless of whether they support
the idea -- that is not the case for a large number of European
citizens. [There is a substantial group for whom 'European sovereignty'
is code for a drive towards neutrality in the escalating competition
between the US and China. For these citizens, European sovereignty is
not a grand entry into international politics but an emergency exit from
the bipolar world of tomorrow. It is an application for early retirement
from great power competition]{.underline}. [This is where public opinion
will have an impact on elite politics. During the cold war, European
governments were willing to face down public opposition to align with a
US that defended them from the Soviet Union. But each president since
the end of the cold war has found it harder to persuade European leaders
to spend political capital on their alliance with
Washington]{.underline}. Europeans were certainly more willing to patch
over their differences with Obama than those with George W Bush, but
this did not extend to real concessions on the management of the 2008
financial crisis or increases in defence spending. While all European
governments will try to build a close relationship with the Biden
administration, they will not feel that they have public support to make
major concessions on high-profile issues of national importance. The
main lesson of ECFR's poll is for the Biden team. [The new American
administration has a clear idea of how Trump's four years have changed
America, but they should be aware of the Trump effect on Europe's
geopolitics of emotions. Although Europeans will not mourn Trump's
electoral defeat, his legacy will persist long after he has left the
White House. [Even as Biden seeks to overturn]{.mark} the
[isolationism]{.mark} and unpredictability of the Trump administration,
[he will be]{.mark} [hampered]{.mark} by policies that made America seem
volatile, selfish, and weak. There is now a unique opportunity to revive
and transform the transatlantic alliance -- but one cannot seize this
with unconvincing promises of restoration and bipolarity. [A new
transatlanticism is needed]{.mark} -- one [based on]{.mark} a [common
understanding]{.mark} that the **[US-Europe alliance is not enough to
reshape the world]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Leonard Cohen once sang "The
mist leaves no scar / On the dark green hill". But our poll shows that
**[[Trump]{.mark} was no fog; he has [left scars]{.mark}. And
[Biden']{.mark}s presidency [will be marked by
them.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

US President Joe Biden made a statement on 14th August: "In our nation's
more than 20 years of war in Afghanistan, the United States has sent its
best young men and women, invested nearly \$1 trillion, trained more
than 300,000 Afghan soldiers and police, equipped them with the most
advanced military equipment and maintained their air force as part of
the longest war in US history." [On 15th August, the Taliban entered the
capital Kabul and the global public was shocked and dismayed. The
fleeing of President Ghani announced the complete failure of 20 years of
US policy in Afghanistan. Firstly, the [US expended enormous
human]{.mark} and material [resources]{.mark} and [failed to achieve the
goal of establishing]{.mark} [democracy]{.mark}, [rebuilding]{.mark}
[Afghanistan]{.mark}, and destroying the Taliban.]{.underline} The
Taliban troops were met with no decent resistance from the Afghan
government. With twenty years of dedication wasted, everything appears
to be back to square one. Secondly, the miscalculation of the
Afghanistan military forces was confusing. The CIA estimated that the
Taliban would take 18 months to take over all of Afghanistan and at
least three months to capture the capital city of Kabul. Yet, it took
the Taliban less than a month to sweep across the country. [The [US
military was stationed]{.mark} in Afghanistan not for just a year or
two, but [for 20 years]{.mark}. Whether it was a CIA intelligence
failure or an optimistic estimate from Biden about the Afghan
government's military strength, it should not have
happened.]{.underline} The US should have had a correct evaluation of
the corruption of the Afghan government, the failure to implant
democracy in Afghanistan, and the strength of the Taliban. The failure
of intelligence was indeed a significant mistake. [Thirdly, the [US
hastily withdrew]{.mark} its [troops]{.mark} from Afghanistan,
[giving]{.mark} the [impression that it is self-serving]{.mark} and
[only cares about itself at critical moments]{.mark}. The US ignored the
great danger to those Afghans who had cooperated with the US military
and the military from other countries. **This has been met with
discontent and complaints** from the Afghan people and criticism from
within the United States and across the world.]{.underline} **[The
[withdrawal is a blow for NATO]{.mark} and
[Europe]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[Unprecedented doubts arise
about]{.mark} the [US]{.mark}'s [cred]{.mark}ibility and ability to keep
its word]{.underline}**. Tony Blair, who ordered the UK military into
the country 20 years ago, publicly criticised Joe Biden's justification
for the pullout as 'imbecilic'. 457 British soldiers were killed in
action. Blair said the withdrawal of the US was 'tragic' and
'unnecessary', and the decision of the US to abandon Afghanistan makes
"every jihadist group around the world cheering"; German President
Steinmeier also sharply criticized the decisions from the US: "The
desperate scene at Kabul Airport is a disgrace to the West." This
incident has revealed the extent of NATO's dependence on the United
States. As Trump correctly pointed out, many European NATO countries
still fall far short of the target of spending 2% of GDP on defence.
[The **US withdrawal from Afghanistan has [made European countries
realize]{.mark} that [it is time to stop relying on US military
power]{.mark}** and instead they must take a more serious approach to
their defence responsibilities. While the outrage over the US pullout
from Afghanistan grew, the]{.underline} [power distribution in
Afghanistan shifted]{.underline}. Sohail Shaheen, a spokesman for the
[Taliban]{.underline}'s political office in Doha, Qatar, told British
media (Sky News) they [received 'political support' from Russia, China,
and Pakistan. So while the world is condemning the US for its
irresponsibility, [China]{.mark}, [Russia]{.mark}, and [Pakistan]{.mark}
are [trying to establish a good relationship with Afghanistan]{.mark}.
The influence of China, Russia and Pakistan is expected to expand in
Afghanistan]{.underline}. Zhu Yongbiao, a Chinese government expert on
Central Asia and a professor at Lanzhou University, stated that "[China
has benefited from \[the US's\] irresponsible behaviour, which has
harmed the US's worldwide image and the relationship between Washington
and its allies"]{.underline}. Arkady Dubnov, a Moscow-based political
analyst and expert on Central Asia, offered a similar view. "[We can
align our interests (with China) in terms of anti-Americanism," he said.
"What is good for us is bad for the Americans, and what is bad for us is
good for the Americans. The situation now is not good for the Americans,
so it's good for us." **[China and Russia may become]{.mark} the [final

THE DECLINE AND FALL OF YOU-KNOW-WHICH GREAT POWER

If that were all, then we could chalk up a few significant wins for
China and just wait for Biden's foreign-policy team to try to even the
score. But there's far more happening that suggests those treaties were
a clear manifestation of deeper, more troubling trends.

[[When empires]{.mark} decline and [fall]{.mark}, they **[seldom
collapse in]{.mark} the sort of [sudden
apocalypse]{.mark}**]{.underline} portrayed in a monumental series of
paintings entitled "The Course of Empire" by another denizen of the
Catskill Mountains, the renowned artist Thomas Cole. His 1836 painting
in that series, now appropriately enough hung at the Smithsonian Museum
in Washington, shows a "savage enemy" plundering a grand imperial
capital whose inhabitants, debased by years of luxurious living, can
only flee in terror while women are raped and buildings burn.

[Empires, however, [usually experience]{.mark} a **[long]{.mark}, [less
dramatic decline]{.mark}**]{.underline} before they fall in the Roman
fashion, thanks to events whose logic only becomes apparent years or
even decades later, as historians try to sort through the rubble. So
it's likely to be in what, until mid--last week, was (and still in many
ways remains) Donald Trump's America, where the signs of decline are as
erratic as they are omnipresent.

The most telling harbinger of that decline, Trump himself, is now in
exile at his Mar-a-Lago Club in Florida. Ten years ago in an essay for
TomDispatch titled "Four Scenarios for the End of the American Century
by 2025," I suggested that **[[US]{.mark} global [heg]{.mark}emony would
[end]{.mark} not]{.underline} [with]{.underline}** Thomas Cole's
[**apocalyptic bang** but instead [with]{.mark} the [whimper of]{.mark}
empty [populist rhetoric]{.mark}. "Riding a political tide of
disillusionment and despair,"]{.underline} I wrote in December 2010[, "a
far-right patriot captures the presidency with thundering rhetoric,
demanding respect for American authority and threatening military
retaliation or economic reprisal. The [world pays]{.mark} next to [no
attention as]{.mark} the [American Century ends]{.mark} [in
silence]{.mark}."]{.underline}

Trump's election in 2016 made all too real what, until then, had only
seemed to me a troubling possibility. With a legerdemain worthy of that
19th century showman P.T. Barnum's bag of bunkum (like the supposed
Cardiff Giant or the Fiji Island Mermaid), Trump's TV show The
Apprentice presented The Donald as a self-made billionaire of
extraordinary financial savvy. Who better to rescue America from the job
losses, stagnant wages, and foreign competition brought on by economic
globalization? But Trump had cheated his way into an Ivy League college;
many of his businesses had gone bankrupt; and his much-vaunted
entrepreneurial flair came down essentially to frittering away a \$400
million inheritance from his father. As journalist H.L. Mencken
predicted back in 1920, America had finally come to the point where "the
plain folks of the land will reach their heart's desire at last and the
White House will be adorned by a downright moron."

Once in office, **[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}** soon [**[bent the
nation]{.mark}** (but not the world) to his will, **[rupturing]{.mark}
time-tested [alliances]{.mark}, [tearing up treaties]{.mark},
[denying]{.mark} incontrovertible climate [science]{.mark}**, and
demanding respect for American authority with a thundering, if largely
[empty]{.mark}, [rhetoric]{.mark} that [threatened military
retaliation]{.mark} or economic reprisals globally. Despite the manifest
inanity of his policies, the Republican Party capitulated, corporate
tycoons applauded, and nearly half the American public cleaved to their
newfound savior.]{.underline}

As with all sellout shows, the best was saved for last. When the
Covid-19 pandemic struck with full force in March 2020, Trump turned up
at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in Atlanta, donning a MAGA hat,
to proclaim his "natural ability" when it came to medical science, while
distinguished doctors stood by like studio extras in mute testimony to
his otherwise risible claims. As the pandemic began climbing toward its
terrible, still developing toll, Trump hijacked White House briefings by
medical experts to promote a succession of crackpot claims---wearing a
mask was merely "politically correct"; Covid-19 was just another flu
that "becomes weaker with warmer weather"; hydroxychloroquine was a
cure; and shining ultraviolet "light inside of the body" or injecting
"disinfectant" were possible treatments. A surprising number of
Americans started drinking bleach to protect themselves from the virus,
forcing months of public health warnings.

[After nearly a century in which the United States had been a world
leader in promoting public health, the Trump administration, to escape
blame for its own escalating failures, walked out of the World Health
Organization. Lending the country the aura of a failed state, the
[CDC]{.mark} itself, once the world's gold standard in medical research,
[bungled]{.mark} the [development of a coronavirus]{.mark} [test]{.mark}
and so forfeited any serious, nationwide attempt to successfully track
and trace the disease (the most effective means of controlling
it).]{.underline}

[[While smaller nations]{.underline}]{.mark} like New Zealand, South

A TRAGICOMIC ENCORE

It was, however, [President Trump's bid for an encore]{.underline} that
[would prove truly extraordinary when it came to imperial decline.
During its 70 years as a global hegemon, **[Washington's]{.mark} public
[promotion of democracy]{.mark} has [been]{.mark} the [signature
program]{.mark} that has [helped legitimate]{.mark} its [global
leadership]{.mark}**]{.underline} [(no]{.mark} matter the CIA-style
interventions it launched or the colonial-style wars it continually
fought).

While the Cold War often compromised that commitment in particularly
striking ways, following its end Washington has spent 30 years
officially promoting fair voting and democratic transitions, with
leaders like former president Jimmy Carter flying off to capitals on
five continents to oversee and encourage free elections. Suddenly, [the
[world watched]{.mark}]{.underline} in slacked-jaw amazement [as, on
[Jan]{.mark}uary [6]{.mark} on the White House ellipse, the **[president
denounced]{.mark} a [fair]{.mark} American [election]{.mark}** as
fraudulent and sent a mob of 10,000 white nationalists, QAnon
conspiracists, and other **[Trumpsters]{.mark} off to [storm]{.mark} the
[Capitol]{.mark}**, where Congress was ratifying the transition to a new
administration]{.underline}.

[Adding to this failed-state aura, the [country's]{.mark}
once-formidable national [security apparatus crumpled]{.mark} like a
Third World constabulary as right-wing militiamen breached the frail
security cordon around the Capitol and stormed its halls as if they were
a lynch mob hunting for congressional leaders]{.underline}. House
majority leader Steny Hoyer's desperate calls to a dawdling Pentagon and
Maryland Governor Larry Hogan's dangerously delayed mobilization of his
state's National Guard, caused by the US military's compromised chain of
command, only seemed to echo the sort of tropical coup scenarios I
witnessed in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, during the 1980s.

[When Congress was finally back in session, the **[Capitol]{.mark} still
[rang with Republican calls]{.mark}**]{.underline}, in the name of
national unity, for forgetting what the president had incited. In that
way, Republican congressional representatives seemed to echo the kind of
impunity that has long protected fallen military juntas in Asia or Latin
America from any accounting for their countless crimes. This attempt, in
other words, to perpetuate a would-be autocrat's power through a
(failed) coup was the sort of spectacle that many millions living in
Asia, Africa, and Latin America have experienced in their own fragile
states but never expected to see in America.

[Suddenly, [our]{.mark} **[supposedly exceptional]{.mark} [nation seemed
tragically ordinary]{.mark}**. The shimmering dome of the [Capitol once
symbolized]{.mark} the vitality of this nation's [democracy]{.mark},
inspiring others to follow its principles or at least acquiesce to its
power. **This [country now looks tattered]{.mark} and [tired]{.mark}**,
caught like others before it between [forgetting]{.mark} in the name of
[unity]{.mark} or demanding the powerful be held accountable for high
crimes that will otherwise haunt the nation. [Instead of aspiring to
America's ideals]{.mark} or entrusting their security to its power,
**many [nations will]{.mark} likely [find]{.mark} [their own way]{.mark}
forward, [cutting deals with]{.mark} all comers, starting with
[China]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

Despite an aura of overwhelming strength, empires, even ones as powerful
as America's, often prove surprisingly fragile and their decline
regularly comes far sooner than anyone could have
imagined---particularly when the cause is not Thomas Cole's "savage
enemy" but their own self-destructive instincts.

[Today, in the era of a 78-year-old president, a veritable Rip Van
Biden, Americans and the **[rest of the world]{.mark} are, it seems,
[waking]{.mark} up [in a]{.mark} [new age]{.mark}. It [could]{.mark}
well [be a daunting one.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[The envisioned trajectory of US-China relations in the Biden era
includes continuity, adjustment, and stabilization.59 [Most anticipate a
return to multilat]{.mark}eralism and short-term easing of tensions.60
Widespread criticism of Trump's unilateralism and enduring ["Trumpism"
prevails, **emphasizing Washington's "irreversible"** competitive
turn]{.mark}.]{.underline}61 As Tian Feilong indicates, ["the new
US-China relationship is centered on competition and conflict," starting
with the trade war and extending to a more comprehensive "new Cold
War."]{.underline} 62 [**[Trumpism]{.mark} [catalyzed]{.mark} the
[long-term]{.mark}** qualitative **[change]{.mark} in bilateral
relations**, and **the [Biden leadership]{.mark} may only [bring
temporary adjustments]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Others project targeted
and balanced adjustments with a continuation of Trump's tough policy
tone, urging Beijing to maintain "strategic rationality."63 Especially
given the level of economic interdependence, while "joint containment"
with allies may replace "unilateral confrontation," "conditional
cooperation" will replace "direct confrontation."64 For optimists, the
Biden era opens an opportunity for pushing relations "back to the
future" rather than "returning to the past" pattern of US China strategy
guided by neoliberal ideology.65 [The long-term stabilization of
bilateral ties depends on building institutional mechanisms for
grounding the relationship within this critical timeframe.]{.underline}
Multilateralism is not just "the only correct path" of post-pandemic
global development, but also requires US-China cooperation.66 The
Trump-Biden Transition: Change and Continuity - [Biden's overarching
diplomatic goal is to restore US global leadership after the damage of
Trumpism,]{.underline} what Zhao Minghao terms a quest to renew the
"West" [in the face of rising challengers like China and
Russia]{.underline}.67 This task relies primarily on reengaging allies,
placing values at the center of US foreign policy, and building a
"community of democratic nations." [Major-power competition remains a
central force, through enhanced deterrence tools like NATO and US
technological competitiveness. As **[Biden pursues post-pandemic
cooperation]{.mark}** on global health and environmental threats, the
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [will only "selectively return"]{.mark}
to multilateralism.]{.underline} According to Liu Guozhu,
[[Biden's]{.mark} national security [strategy **seeks
to**]{.mark}]{.underline} not just reverse Trump's withdrawal from
multilateralism but also ["**[dominate]{.mark} the [global
governance]{.mark} system [with US]{.mark} values and
[principles]{.mark}**."]{.underline}68 [The key task of
["**de-Trumping"**]{.mark} domestic and foreign affairs **[comes
with]{.mark}** an **enduring [deterioration in US-China
relations]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [This trend **extends to US relations
with other major-powers**, as evidenced by the "long-term freeze" in
US-Russia ties.]{.underline}69 [The **["misalignment of strategic goals"
between]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and
Europe]{.mark}** [makes it difficult for]{.mark} the [Biden]{.mark}
administration [to restore their]{.mark} [traditional
alliance]{.mark}.]{.underline}70 But [while the waning of the West
reflects "European anxiety," **[European partners]{.mark} may
[support]{.mark}** the [long-term]{.mark} consolidation of
**[multilat]{.mark}eralism**.]{.underline}71 Soon after RCEP's signing,
the upgrading of ASEAN-EU relations into a strategic partnership at the
end of 2020 signified a mutual willingness to uphold multilateralism.72
According to Fu Ying, [China and Europe's "common interest in upholding
multilateralism" is especially important at a time when "Europe needs
space for independent thinking" amid US-China
competition.]{.underline}73 [The **[Biden]{.mark}** leadership
**[inherits Trump's designation of China as a]{.mark}** strategic
competitor and **[revisionist power]{.mark}**.]{.underline} There are
differences in the means of competition including multilateral
mechanisms and the US alliance system Biden seeks to revamp. But under
current conditions, China will more effectively respond to US strategy
and actively shape the relationship. From this perspective, Wu Xinbo
identifies three models of interaction in the next four years: 1) an
ideal scenario of competition and cooperation, 2) competition-led
relations, and 3) the worst-case scenario of competition-conflict.74
While most studies accentuate the second pattern, [perceptions of US
policy change and continuity in the Biden era depend on issue
areas]{.underline}. Preliminary reviews center on four areas:
[Washington's]{.underline} Indo-Pacific strategy, ["technological
nationalism," economic competition, and US domestic
politics.]{.underline} [While domestic concerns remain in rehabilitating
the economy, controlling the pandemic, and relieving social grievances,
bipartisan consensus reinforces views of continuity on key foreign
policy issues.]{.underline}75 [**[Despite]{.mark} [Biden's stronger
emphasis on multilat]{.mark}eralism, [continuity outweighs]{.mark}**
**[adjustments]{.mark}**]{.underline} in Asia-Pacific security policy,
[with no substantive actions in the short term on regional economic
integration. [Trump's tough policy tone resonates in]{.mark} economic
[relations with China]{.mark}, and especially science and technology
competition.]{.underline}

THE GREAT-POWER COMEBACK

[Today, other great powers offer rival conceptions of global
order]{.underline}, [often autocratic ones that appeal to many leaders
of weaker states. The **[West no longer presides over]{.mark} a
[monopoly of patronage]{.mark}**. New **[regional
organizations]{.mark}** and **[illiberal]{.mark} transnational
[networks]{.mark} [contest U.S. influence]{.mark}**. Long-term **[shifts
in]{.mark} the global [economy]{.mark}**, particularly the **[rise of
China]{.mark}**, **[account for]{.mark} many of these
[developments]{.mark}**. These changes have [transformed]{.mark} the
[geopolitical landscape.]{.mark}]{.underline}

In April 1997, [Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Russian President
Boris Yeltsin pledged "to promote the multipolarization of the world and
the establishment of a new international order." For years, many
[Western scholars]{.mark} and policymakers downplayed or
[dismissed]{.mark} such [challenges]{.mark} as wishful rhetoric. Beijing
remained committed to the rules and norms of the U.S.-led order, they
argued, [pointing out]{.mark} that [China]{.mark} continued to [benefit
from]{.mark} the [current system]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Even as Russia
grew increasingly assertive in its condemnation of the United States in
the first decade of this century and called for a more multipolar world,
observers [didn't think]{.mark} that [Moscow could muster
support]{.mark} from any significant allies. **Analysts in the West**
specifically **[doubted]{.mark} that [Beijing and Moscow could
overcome]{.mark} decades of [mistrust]{.mark}** and rivalry [to]{.mark}
[cooperate against U.S. efforts]{.mark} to maintain and shape the
international order.]{.underline}

[Such skepticism made sense at the height of U.S. global
hegemony]{.underline} in the 1990s and even remained plausible through
much of the following decade. [[But]{.mark} the 1997 declaration now
looks like a blueprint for how Beijing and Moscow have tried to reorder
international politics in the last 20 years]{.underline}.
[[China]{.mark} and [Russia]{.mark} [now directly contest liberal
aspects of]{.mark} the [international]{.mark} [order]{.mark} from within
that order's institutions and forums; at the same time, they are
building an alternative order through new institutions and venues in
which they wield greater influence]{.underline} and can de-emphasize
human rights and civil liberties.

[[At]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [N]{.mark}ations]{.underline}, for
example, [the **two countries [routinely consult on votes]{.mark}** and
initiatives. As permanent members of the UN Security Council, they have
coordinated their opposition to criticize Western interventions and
calls for regime change; they have **[veto]{.mark}ed [Western-sponsored
proposals]{.mark}** on Syria and efforts to impose sanctions on
Venezuela and Yemen.]{.underline} In the UN General Assembly, between
2006 and 2018, China and Russia voted the same way 86 percent of the
time, more frequently than during the 78 percent voting accord the two
shared between 1991 and 2005. By contrast, since 2005, China and the
United States have agreed only 21 percent of the time. [Beijing and
Moscow have also **[led]{.mark} UN [initiatives to promote new
norms]{.mark}**, most **notably [in]{.mark} the arena of
[cyberspace]{.mark}**, that privilege national sovereignty]{.underline}
over individual rights[,]{.underline} limit the doctrine of the
responsibility to protect, and [**curtail the power of Western-sponsored
human rights resolutions**.]{.underline}

[China and Russia have also been [at]{.mark} the [forefront of
**creating**]{.mark} **new [international institutions]{.mark}** and
regional forums that **[exclude the]{.mark} United States and the
[West]{.mark} more broadly**]{.underline}. Perhaps the most well known
of these is the BRICS grouping, which includes Brazil, Russia, India,
China, and South Africa. Since 2006, the group has presented itself as a
dynamic setting for the discussion of matters of international order and
global leadership, including building alternatives to Western-controlled
institutions in the areas of Internet governance, international payment
systems, and development assistance. In 2016, the BRICS countries
created the New Development Bank, which is dedicated to [**financing
infrastructure projects** in the developing world]{.underline}.

[China and Russia have each also pushed a **[plethora of new]{.mark}
regional [security organizations]{.mark}**]{.underline}---including the
Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia, the
Collective Security Treaty Organization, and the Quadrilateral
Cooperation and Coordination Mechanism---and economic institutions,
including the Chinese-run Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB)
and the Russian-backed Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU). The Shanghai
Cooperation Organization (SCO)---a security organization that [promotes
cooperation among security services and oversees biennial military
exercises]{.underline}---was founded in 2001 at the initiative of both
Beijing and Moscow. It added India and Pakistan as full members in 2017.
The [net result is the emergence of parallel structures of global
governance]{.underline} that are dominated by authoritarian states and
[that compete with older, more liberal structures.]{.underline}

[Critics often dismiss]{.underline} the BRICS, the EAEU, and the SCO [as
"talk shops" in which member states do little to actually resolve
problems or otherwise engage in meaningful cooperation. But
[most]{.mark} **other [international institutions]{.mark} [are no
different]{.mark}.** Even when they prove unable to solve collective
problems, regional organizations **[allow]{.mark} their [members to
affirm common values]{.mark}** and boost the stature of the powers that
convene these forums. They generate [denser diplomatic ties]{.mark}
among their members, which, in turn, make it [easier for]{.mark} those
[members to build military]{.mark} and political [coalitions]{.mark}. In
short, these organizations **[constitute]{.mark} a [critical part
of]{.mark} the infrastructure of [international order]{.mark}**, an
infrastructure that was dominated by Western democracies after the end
of the Cold War]{.underline}. Indeed, this new array of non-Western
organizations has brought transnational governance mechanisms into
regions such as Central Asia, which were previously disconnected from
many institutions of global governance. Since 2001, most Central Asian
states have joined the SCO, the Russian-led Collective Security Treaty
Organization, the EAEU, the AIIB, and the Chinese infrastructure
investment project known as the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).

[China and Russia are also now pushing into areas traditionally
dominated by the United States and its allies]{.underline}; for example,
China convenes the 17+1 group with states in central and eastern Europe
and the China-CELAC (Community of Latin American and Caribbean States)
Forum in Latin America. [These groupings provide states in these regions
with **new arenas for partnership and support** while also
**[challenging]{.mark} the [cohesion of traditional Western
blocs]{.mark}**]{.underline}; just days before the 16+1 group expanded
to include the EU member Greece in April 2020, the European Commission
moved to designate China a "systemic rival" amid concerns that BRI deals
in Europe were undercutting EU regulations and standards.

[[Beijing]{.mark} and [Moscow]{.mark} appear to be **[successfully
managing]{.mark} their [alliance of convenience]{.mark}**, defying
predictions that they would be unable to tolerate each other's
international projects. This has even been the case in areas in which
their divergent interests could lead to significant tensions. **[Russia
vocally supports]{.mark} China's [BRI]{.mark}**, despite its inroads
into Central Asia, which Moscow still considers its
backyard]{.underline}. In fact, since 2017, the [Kremlin's rhetoric has
shifted from talking about a clearly demarcated Russian "sphere of
influence" in Eurasia to [embracing]{.mark} a "[Greater Eurasia]{.mark}"
in which Chinese-led investment and integration dovetails with Russian
efforts to shut out Western influence]{.underline}. Moscow followed a
similar pattern when Beijing first proposed the formation of the AIIB in
2015. The Russian Ministry of Finance initially refused to back the
bank, but the Kremlin changed course after seeing which way the wind was
blowing; Russia formally joined the bank at the end of the year.

[**[China]{.mark} has also [proved willing to accommodate Russian
concerns]{.mark}** and sensitivities]{.underline}. China joined the
other BRICS countries in abstaining from condemning Russia's annexation
of Crimea in 2014, even though doing so clearly contravened China's
long-standing opposition to separatism and violations of territorial
integrity. Moreover, the Trump administration's trade war with China has
given Beijing additional incentives to support Russian efforts to
develop alternatives to the Western-controlled SWIFT international
payment system and dollar-denominated trade so as to undermine the
global reach of U.S. sanctions regimes.

[[If one concedes]{.mark} **the modest [assumptions]{.mark}**
[associated to]{.mark} the [tech]{.mark}nological theory, then it is
**clear**]{.underline} that [hypersonic]{.underline} glide vehicles are
a technology that [will]{.underline} in all likelihood
**[stabilize]{.underline}** the strategic relationship between those who
have them into the near future. [If one concedes]{.underline} that [the
[purpose of]{.mark}]{.underline} nuclear [[deterrence]{.mark} since the
1960s [is]{.mark}]{.underline} based [[not]{.underline}]{.mark} upon
avoiding and [[deterring]{.mark} a [limited]{.mark} nuclear
[war]{.mark}]{.underline} per se, [[but]{.mark} rather **a general
[nuclear exchange]{.mark}** then it becomes **increasingly
obvious**]{.underline} that [hypersonic]{.underline} glide vehicles [are
**stabilizing**. If one concedes that [no matter **the**]{.mark}
**current technological [gap]{.mark}** between the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates, [and Russia and China that **[the]{.mark} current
strategic [relationship]{.mark}** [is]{.mark}]{.underline} one of MAD,
and [[premised]{.underline}]{.mark} up[[on MAD]{.mark}, then it is
clear]{.underline} that [hypersonics are stabilizing. If one
concedes]{.underline} that [it is plausible that **strategic
[escalation]{.mark}** [offers]{.mark} decision makers the [ability to
refocus]{.mark}]{.underline} their interests [[and avoid]{.mark}
escalation into **general [nuclear war]{.mark}**[, then hypersonics are
stabilizing]{.mark}]{.underline}. The question remains, however, as it
does with most strategic literature, what exactly should decision makers
do knowing this information. Studies on strategic stability were born
during the Cold War, and the aim of these studies was to describe what a
strategically stable relationship looked like, and what to do if
particular technologies, doctrines, or postures undermined this
strategic stability. Thus it was also tied intimately towards arms
control and its associated literature. Since the goal of deterrence is
to avoid nuclear war than states should pursue strategies and their
related technologies that foment the most strategically stable
relationship; because stability relates to the state in which general
nuclear war is least likely to occur- not that cannot occur for a
variety of political and other reasons in a stable relationship, but
that a stable relationship has less risk of war than an unstable
relationship. This is also the period when MAD became intimately tied81
to strategic stability between great powers. Although much has changed
since the Cold War, the fundamental strategic relationship between the
great powers today is one of deterrence premised upon MAD. Moreover,
[[tech]{.mark}nological development]{.underline} in one way or another
[[can **never**]{.mark} **truly** [be stopped]{.mark}]{.underline} it
seems; and thus it is still the responsibility of the strategic studies
discipline to examine the effects of new technologies, doctrines, and
postures of the great powers; and from those studies make educated
prescriptions about policy direction. **[The spectre of a general
nuclear war]{.underline}** still [haunts the modern world]{.underline},
even if most have forgotten it. Much has been made in the past 30 years
describing a new international security relationship, one in which MAD
had receded into the background of international peace and security.
Understandably, developments such as 9/11 and other security concerns
shifted the focus of strategic studies. Still, if one looks closely the
threat of nuclear conflict remained prescient in the strategic
maneuverings of states since the end of the Cold War. Much of [Russian
and Chinese aggression]{.underline} in their respective spheres of
influence [is]{.underline} still [guaranteed by nuclear
weapons]{.underline}. Although counterfactual, it is not hard to imagine
the United States acting differently with these countries had not both
had nuclear weapons-i.e. Ukraine, Syria, South China sea etc. Still, the
old strategic study of nuclear and strategic deterrence is coming into
view and as such the revival of the study of strategic stability is
natural in this sense. Indeed, the development of
[[hypersonic]{.underline}]{.mark} weapons in general, and hypersonic
glide vehicles in particular, [[represents]{.mark} **the [first]{.mark}
major technological [development]{.mark}**]{.underline} of these weapons
[[since the Cold War]{.underline}]{.mark}. As with technologies in the
Cold War such as ABM and MIRV, each new technology must be studied so
that educated policy decisions can be82 made by the great powers moving
forward. Thus the implications of whether or not hypersonic glide
vehicles are stabilizing or not is directly relevant to whether the
states that have or will have them in the near future, should either
unilaterally, bilaterally, or multilaterally control them; or
conversely, adopt and implement them on mass. [[Under **comprehensive
examination**]{.mark} **of all the factors** that relate to]{.underline}
strategic [stability, it becomes **evident**]{.underline} that
[hypersonic]{.underline} glide vehicles [will stabilize the relationship
between the three great powers. [Similar to]{.mark}]{.underline} their
[[MIRV]{.underline}]{.mark} counterparts [during the Cold War
[hypersonic]{.mark}]{.underline} glide vehicles are a particular
response by states to [[increase]{.mark} **the [parity]{.mark} of their
strategic relationships**, and [make]{.mark} **their [threats]{.mark} of
assured destruction** [credible]{.mark}. Hyperglides [offset]{.mark}
**[b]{.mark}**]{.underline}allistic **[[m]{.underline}]{.mark}**issile
**[[d]{.underline}]{.mark}**efences [[and offer]{.underline}]{.mark} the
ability for [**increased [restraint]{.mark}** [when compared to]{.mark}
**their [ICBM]{.mark} counterparts**]{.underline} in their utilization
as escalatory devices. [[They are **better**]{.mark}
**placed**]{.underline} to escalate [[for]{.underline}]{.mark} the
purposes of [[de-escalation and]{.underline}]{.mark} thus
[[induce]{.mark} **increased [stability]{.mark}**]{.underline} to a
strategic relationship. [**The theoretical [matrix]{.mark}**
[indicates]{.mark}]{.underline} that it is highly plausible that moving
forward [these [weapons will **stabilize**]{.mark} **rather than
de-stabilize** the strategic relationships between **the three great
powers**]{.underline}. Theoretically, and historically- if MIRVs are
indeed a similar case- then it is plausible that hyperglides will only
serve to stabilize the strategic balance between the great powers.
Interestingly, this paper argues contrary to the
[[majority]{.underline}]{.mark} of current strategic
[opinion]{.underline} concerning hypersonic glide vehicles. It is likely
that the discrepancy arises from the recognition that there are two ways
to interpret the goal of modern strategic deterrence. Most of the
community, at least implicitly, seems to reflect the belief that
strategic deterrence is directed toward avoiding any strategic exchange.
Similar to their historic counterparts during the Cold War, they
[**[overvalue]{.mark}** the weight of
[counterforce]{.mark}]{.underline}83 [[against]{.mark} **the [other
dimensions]{.mark} of stability**]{.underline}. Ultimately, [American,
Russian, and]{.underline} probably [Chinese [deterrence is
not]{.mark}]{.underline} in fact [[directed]{.mark} [to]{.mark}wards
[avoiding any]{.mark} strategic [exchange but]{.mark}
rather]{.underline} directed [toward avoiding **a [general
war]{.mark}**[, and]{.mark} **the [civilizational costs]{.mark}
associated**]{.underline}. American strategy since the 1960s is an
implicit proponent of the notion that escalation can be utilized to
de-escalate before falling into a general war. So too, modern Russian
strategy has adopted an escalate to de-escalate strategy for the
purposes of not falling into an general war.159 Deterrence deals with
perception and psychology, indicating that if the United States, and
Russia believe that credible deterrence is one that allows for
escalation then both implicitly believe in the ability for escalatory
strategies to de-escalate a conflict. This means
[inherently]{.underline} that [[counterforce]{.mark} weapons
[have]{.mark} a [positive impact on]{.mark}]{.underline} credibility,
and through credibility to **[[MAD]{.mark} and stability]{.underline}**.
A theory that does not take into account the strategic doctrines and
beliefs at least generally of the parties involved would fail to provide
decision makers with policy decisions that will be enacted. Thus policy
prescriptions should seek to understand the strategic balance as it is
and provide the best advice it can regarding policy to positively impact
the perceived stability of the relationship. [[Deterrence is
**unique**]{.mark} **psychologically**, because it relates to the
recognition that [if states **believe** a relationship is stable it
**is**]{.mark} **more stable**]{.underline}. In this sense
[[counterforce]{.underline}]{.mark} targeting [[is stabilizing
because]{.mark} the great [powers believe it]{.mark} to be]{.underline}
stabilizing. In any case [[it is]{.mark} **the [failure]{.mark}**
[of]{.mark} **the majority of hyperglide [lit]{.mark}erature**
[to]{.mark} **properly [understand]{.mark}** the [goal of]{.mark} modern
[deterrence and]{.mark}]{.underline} thus they [accidentally
claim]{.underline} that weapons systems, such as [hyperglides,
de-stabilize the relationship when in fact they stabilize
it]{.underline}. Recognizing then that hyperglides positively affect
strategic stability, it is the position of this paper that this
technology should be readily adopted by all the great powers. Indeed,
they should not be controlled until their strategic aim has been met,
and increased forces would overrun on costs. If that becomes the case,
states should seek to control them on the back end laying out as they
did with SALT I and the Vladivostok Accords, the strategic limits and
boundaries of the relationship once all three parties are satisfied with
their forces. In this regard, after full deployment the parties can
engage one another and add increased stability by setting the upper
limits of what the relationship will look like; and in so doing more
readily cement the strategic stability between them. This should not be
confused with the actual control of the weapons; as [[any control
before]{.mark} **great power strategic [parity]{.mark}** has been
achieved [would]{.mark} a) [not be possible]{.mark} because the [Chinese
and Russians would not agree to being]{.mark} **so [inferior]{.mark}**
[and]{.mark} b) **[cementing disparity]{.mark}** as it exists now
[would]{.mark}]{.underline} potentially over time begin to
[[shift]{.mark} the relationship [from parity to supremacy
and]{.mark}]{.underline} in said [shift the relationship would be
[de-stabilized]{.mark}]{.underline}. At its heart, arms control should
not be about refusing technological innovations. Rather, it should be
directed toward controlling the affects that arms have on strategic
relationships; meaning both that if a technology undermines the
relationship it should be limited and controlled, and if a technology
seeks to create a more stable relationship it should be adopted fully to
each party's extent and then have boundaries set, once all parties are
convinced of the stability of the relationship vis-à-vis that
technology. Hyperglide vehicles will stabilize the relationship, which
over the past 30 years has become neglected; bringing increased85
stability to the relationship and decreasing the likelihood of war. As
such [**the great [powers]{.mark}** [should welcome this]{.mark}
technology and **its beneficial effects** on strategic
stability]{.underline}.

Having unearthed the answer to that question it becomes important to ask
the connected question: what is the hyperglides utility in escalation,
and how might this plausibly impact credibility? [[Hyperglides
are]{.mark} **much [better]{.mark}** than]{.underline} their
[traditional ICBM]{.underline} counterparts [in]{.underline} the realm
of [escalation and controlled reprisal]{.underline} because [they are
[more penetrable]{.mark} and [survivable]{.mark}]{.underline}; moreover,
their [[maneuverability]{.mark} has **unique impacts** on]{.underline}
the strategic [decision making]{.underline} of an adversary, [which
offers **unique [firebreaks]{.mark}** to **the [escalation]{.mark}
ladder**]{.underline}. What is unique about hyperglide vehicles in the
escalation ladder relates directly to their speed and maneuverability.
[[Since]{.mark} the [hyperglide]{.mark} can [maneuver during]{.mark}
**most of its [flight]{.mark}**[, it is]{.mark} **relatively
[unclear]{.mark}** to the receiving party precisely [what is]{.mark}
being [targeted]{.mark}]{.underline}. For instance,
[[imagine]{.underline}]{.mark} that the [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}n
Federation in a crisis [[launched **a**]{.mark}**n escalate to
de-escalate [strike]{.mark}** against the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates, [coming [over the North]{.mark} pole. [In a one
off]{.mark} shot, **prudence and [patience]{.mark}** among the
American]{.underline} general [staff [should be warranted until]{.mark}
after the missile has [struck]{.mark}]{.underline} its target. [**For
instance**, a [hypersonic]{.mark}]{.underline} glide vehicle coming over
the north pole directed generally toward the central United States,
[[could]{.underline}]{.mark} be [[target]{.underline}]{.mark}ing
[**[a]{.mark}ny [series]{.mark} of targets**; US[STRATCOM, in
Omaha]{.mark}]{.underline} Nebraska, [a US [air base outside Minot,
or]{.mark}]{.underline} even [**an [uninhabited]{.mark} area**
in]{.underline} northern [[Manitoba. Each]{.underline}]{.mark} of these
three targets [[sends **a different**]{.mark} **deterrence
[message]{.mark}**]{.underline} to the United States. Each of these
three hypotheticals, and any series of others illustrates the utility of
these systems in escalatory strikes to send71 different messages. [When
coupled with]{.underline} the [[speed]{.underline}]{.mark} of the
systems, [[and target indistinguishability]{.mark} it should
[induce]{.mark}]{.underline} control and command to
**[[patience]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Inevitably their maneuverability
means that [[it would be unclear until]{.mark} **almost [the last
moments]{.mark} of flight**]{.underline} as to [[what
the]{.underline}]{.mark} particular [[response should
be]{.underline}]{.mark}. In each case the response would change, because
the signal and associated costs change. Striking STRATCOM is not the
same in a strategic sense as striking northern Manitoba. Finally, the
[[speeds]{.mark} of]{.underline} current [hyperglide]{.underline}
vehicles [is]{.underline} roughly [[half]{.mark} that [of]{.mark}
current [ICBMs]{.mark}]{.underline}.154 This means that the average
flight time of a intercontinental hypersonic vehicle is roughly 45-60
minutes as compared to the traditional ICBMs 30 minute flight time.
[Increased time and the inability]{.underline} of actors [to recognize
the target]{.underline} further [induces]{.underline} command and
control to **[patience]{.underline}**. Fundamentally, the
[speed]{.underline} of the vehicles [offers decision makers roughly
**one third to [twice as much time]{.mark}** [to comprehend]{.mark}
**the best [response]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and]{.mark} **the likely
[effects]{.mark}** that response will have]{.underline} on one's
adversary. [[This induces]{.underline}]{.mark} decision makers to [[**a
better decision** and]{.mark} offers them **more [time]{.mark}** [to
consider **the**]{.mark} **big [strategic picture]{.mark}** and the
costs]{.underline} associated [with **improper retaliation and
escalation**]{.underline}. The target necessitates the response such
that a different target induces a different response, which means it
would be imprudent to act before the target has been struck. The [[speed
offers]{.mark} **precious [resources]{.mark}** [in]{.mark}]{.underline}
the form of [**time for [leadership]{.mark}** [to formulate]{.mark}
**the best [response]{.mark}** to the escalatory strike; it gives them
more time to consider what their responses effect will have
and]{.underline} thus [**in total examination** increases the likelihood
that commanders will **properly perceive** the costs and benefits
of]{.underline} further [aggression]{.underline} on both sides, [[such
that]{.mark} **a general [nuclear war]{.mark}** [is]{.mark} **more
[avoidable]{.mark}** than]{.underline} was previously the case [with
**traditional ICBMs**]{.underline}. In this sense, [hyperglides have **a
unique utility** on the escalatory ladder when [compared to]{.mark}
**their [ICBM siblings]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

HGVs and their Impact on Credibility Before we can understand the
overarching impact of the weapon on credibility writ large we must first
ask: are hyperglides likely to serve a counter-force or countervalue
role, and how might this plausibly impact credibility? Into the near
future, [hypersonic]{.underline} glide vehicles [will be]{.underline}
primarily [designated as]{.underline} especially useful
[counter-force]{.underline} weapons. Technological limitations, arising
out of the fact that these systems are still being tested and perfected
by the relative powers at play, suggests that [**the early
[utility]{.mark}** of these weapons [will be]{.mark}]{.underline} as
**[[precision strike]{.mark}, strategic missiles]{.underline}**, that
will be utilized [[to]{.mark} **reliably destroy** critical
infrastructure in [one off attack]{.mark}s for]{.underline} the purposes
of [escalate to deescalate. [It is]{.mark} **entirely
[plausible]{.mark}**]{.underline} that [in a crisis, [an
adversary]{.mark}]{.underline} seeking to escalate to deescalate [[would
utilize]{.underline}]{.mark} one of [[these]{.underline}]{.mark} missile
systems [[thanks to]{.mark} **their increased [penetrability and
survivability]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The utilization of [**a
traditional [ICBM]{.mark}** for a one shot]{.underline} escalate to
deescalate attack [risks being [shot down by BMD]{.mark} system,
and]{.underline} in so doing [[fails to send **the**]{.mark} **proper
escalatory [message]{.mark}**]{.underline} to one's adversary.
[[Without]{.mark} [hyperglides]{.mark} an [adversary
might]{.mark}]{.underline} be incentivized to [[shoot **not one but
three**]{.mark} **traditional [ICBMs]{.mark}** and]{.underline} thus
[[send a message that]{.mark} does not escalate to de-escalate but
rather **[escalates]{.mark} in [the extreme]{.mark}**. The ability of
hyperglides to **reliably strike** whichever]{.underline} target
[it]{.underline} so [chooses while [frustrating BMD makes them]{.mark}
**particularly useful** as counterforce weapons]{.underline} in the near
future. As a counterforce weapon, [these]{.underline} systems
[[stabilize]{.underline}]{.mark} the strategic relationship [because
[they provide]{.mark} the]{.underline} technical [[means]{.mark} for an
actor [to send]{.mark} **the [proper]{.mark} escalatory
[messages]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} put **a [firebreak]{.mark} on the
[conflict]{.mark}**[. Counterforce]{.mark} weapons, while incentivizing
war actually]{.underline} seek to [[stop escalation into]{.mark} **a
[general]{.mark} strategic [exchange]{.mark}**, and]{.underline} in so
doing [stabilize the relationship]{.underline}. Their [**increased
[survivability]{.mark} after launch** [indicates]{.mark}]{.underline} to
one's [[adversary]{.underline}]{.mark} that they [[cannot
protect]{.mark} themselves, [offering incentives]{.mark} for the party
attacked [to consider]{.mark} **further [aggression]{.mark}** and the
costs]{.underline} associated with such action. [[There's **no**]{.mark}
**strategic [benefit]{.mark}** at the moment or]{.underline} projected
[in]{.underline}to [the]{.underline} near and medium [future for
hyperglides [to]{.mark} be]{.underline} utilized as
[[counter-value]{.mark} weapons- [it would be cheaper to build]{.mark}
**[massive]{.mark} amounts** of **cheaper [ICBMs and
SLBMs]{.mark}**]{.underline} to fulfill this role. In any case the
[targeting]{.underline} of [[counter-value assets is
destabilizing]{.mark} because [it removes]{.mark} **any
[incentives]{.mark}** for the other party [to not **respond**]{.mark}
**strategically**]{.underline}. Indeed, [[counter-force]{.mark} weapons
[provide]{.mark} **the unique [capability]{.mark}** to escalate
[to]{.mark}]{.underline}70 [de-escalate and send **the strategic
[signals]{.mark}**]{.underline} necessary to one's adversary [that
escalation into]{.underline} the [counter-value]{.underline} domain [is
unwanted by both parties. In this regard then
[hypersonic]{.mark}]{.underline} glide vehicles [stabilize]{.underline}
the strategic relationships [because they [make]{.mark} **the prospect
of a [general war]{.mark}** [less likely]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Recognizing their strategic implications, it is possible now to inquire
of hyperglides, what their likely impact will be on the broader
conceptual notions surrounding credibility. What are the plausible
impacts of the weapon on communication capability, and political will?
[[Hyperglides]{.mark} offer **a unique capability** that
[communicates]{.mark} **a very real and [credible
threat]{.mark}**]{.underline} to one's adversary. The [inability to
defend against these]{.underline} systems, due to their capabilities,
[offers **a credible deterrent**]{.underline}. While they have direct
impacts on the capability, [[it is]{.underline}]{.mark} also [their
[impact on]{.mark} political [will that engenders]{.mark} **the
increasing [credibility]{.mark}** of one's deterrent. In regard
to]{.underline} specifically [political will, [hyperglides]{.mark}
provide instruments that [are]{.mark} **actually [useable]{.mark}**
[for]{.mark}]{.underline} the purposes of [[deterring]{.mark} **a
[general]{.mark} nuclear [war]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The [[inability to
stop them]{.mark} from hitting targets, [and]{.mark} their
[precision]{.mark}]{.underline} as weapons [[gives actor's **a host
of**]{.mark} **viable [decisions]{.mark}**]{.underline} for their
utilization as escalatory weapons. In this sense, their credibility is
directly related to their usability. Hypersonic glide vehicles represent
soon, and for the near future a weapon that is uniquely useable. In the
tradition of Herman Khan, [a [weapons]{.mark} system that is [unusable
has no]{.mark} **deterrence [effect]{.mark}**]{.underline}.155 [Credible
deterrence requires]{.underline} that political [actors **actually be
able to use them**]{.underline}. In this sense, then [hyperglides
provide **the necessary delivery systems** to **actually use** one's
weapons]{.underline}, and thus provide a credible deterrent to one's
enemy. [[Hyperglides are **flexible**]{.underline}]{.mark} weapons that
provide increased credibility to a state's deterrent. [**The [positive
effects]{.mark}** of hyperglides on credibility]{.underline} have a
correlating positive [[affect]{.underline}]{.mark} on
[[stability]{.underline}]{.mark}. Such that it can be argued in this
regard that hypersonic glide vehicles are stabilizing. HGVs and their
Impact on the Deterrence Relationship Understanding the impacts of this
new technology on credibility it is now possible to examine more broadly
its affects on the strategic deterrence relationship between the three
great powers. Recognizing [**the [foundation]{.mark}al relationship**
[between]{.mark} **the three [great powers]{.mark}**
[is]{.mark}]{.underline} one of [[MAD]{.underline}]{.mark}, we must
inquire as to the effects of hyperglides on this strategic balance. We
ask hyperglides first: do hypersonic glide vehicles enhance the assured
destruction capability of each party? In a general sense,
[[hypersonic]{.underline}]{.mark} glide vehicles [are
stabilizing]{.underline} to the deterrence relationship [because they
[enhance]{.mark} **the [assured destruction]{.mark}
capability**]{.underline} of the nations who hold them. The
[[Americans]{.underline}]{.mark} already [[retain]{.mark} **relatively
complex [BMD]{.mark} mid-course defences** against ICBMs]{.underline},
and [both the Chinese and Russians are investing in **their own
complex** mid-course ballistic defence programs]{.underline}.156 [**The
enhanced assured destruction capability** arises
[from]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[maneuverability and unusual
altitudes]{.underline}]{.mark} in particular. At their core
[[hypersonic]{.underline}]{.mark} glide vehicles [[are]{.mark}
**increasingly [survivable]{.mark}**]{.underline} when compared to older
missile systems, [enhancing **the overall destructive
effect**]{.underline} of a states deterrent by ensuring that once
launched these missiles will hit their target. The
[capabilities]{.underline} of these new missiles [threaten adversaries
with destruction, which lies [at **the heart of MAD**]{.mark}. They make
each]{.underline} of the [states more vulnerable to attack]{.underline}
than they would be without these systems. **[This increased [mutual
vulnerability]{.mark}]{.underline}** of states to these systems
[[ensures]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[each]{.mark} party [will
retain]{.mark} **an [assured destruction]{.mark}
capability**]{.underline} into the near future. Having enhanced the
destructive capability of each state who will hold them, the next
question that has to be answered is: do hyperglides undermine the
ability of the other party's assured destruction capability?
[[Hyperglides **do not**]{.mark} **and will not**]{.underline} have the
capability to [[undermine]{.mark} the [assured destruction]{.mark}
capability of any of the three great powers]{.underline} into the near
future. The majority of [[these]{.mark} states' **assured destruction
capability**]{.underline} [either [exist
**underwater**]{.mark}]{.underline}-[in]{.underline} the form of
[SSBNs]{.underline}-, [[or **on land**]{.underline}]{.mark}-
[in]{.underline} the form of [mobile ICBM launchers]{.underline}.
Whatever worries exist about their ability to take out the assured
destruction capability of states, such as [China]{.underline} must
[recognize]{.underline} that [[this]{.underline}]{.mark} problem [[can
be remedied]{.mark} **doctrinally** [with]{.mark}]{.underline} the
adoption of a [[launch-on-warning]{.underline}]{.mark} posture. This
indicates that they do not in a comprehensive sense undermine assured
retaliatory capability of the three great powers.

Turning finally to the specific impacts of hypersonic glides vehicles on
arms race and crisis stability we can ask two questions. First we ask,
[do [hypersonic]{.mark}]{.underline} glide vehicles [undermine the
retaliatory capability of peer-to-peer competitors?]{.underline} In
regards to75 hyperglides [they **do not and [will not]{.mark}**
[have]{.mark} **any specific [impact]{.mark}** on]{.underline} the
[strategic [retaliatory capability]{.mark}]{.underline} of actors in the
near to medium future. Inevitably, [[they]{.underline}]{.mark} are
designed to [[target counterforce]{.mark} weapons]{.underline}, and [the
[cost, tech]{.mark}nical characteristics, [and]{.mark} initial
[deployments]{.mark}, will [lack]{.mark} the [capability to
threaten]{.mark} **the major powers [retaliatory
capability]{.mark}**]{.underline} into the near future. The Russians,
Americans, and Chinese [all understand]{.underline} that [the primary
[retaliatory]{.mark} capability]{.underline} of their states' [[exist
in]{.mark} their [ICBM and SLBM assets]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
Russians currently deploy 1,420 strategic nuclear warheads on a series
of platforms. The Chinese currently deploy 280 strategic nuclear
warheads deployed on a series of platforms. The Americans for their part

Given the key role of funding in supporting terrorist operations,
counterterrorism efforts---in particular, the subfield of
counterterrorism finance (CTF)---often focus on tracking the flow of
money through bank accounts and preventing financial transactions that
might be used to support attacks and other terrorist activities.
However, the success of [[CTF strategies]{.mark} in reducing terrorist
access to fiat (i.e., government-issued) currencies has [raised]{.mark}
[concerns]{.mark} that **[terrorist]{.mark} organization[s]{.mark} might
[increase]{.mark} their [use of]{.mark} such [digital]{.mark}
[cryptocurrencies]{.mark} as Bitcoin [to support]{.mark} their
[activities]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Bitcoin is both a protocol for
securely storing and transmitting tokens (virtual coins) and the name of
the unit of value in the system. [Bitcoin [revolves around]{.mark} a
public ledger called the [blockchain]{.mark}, which is [maintained
by]{.mark} an [online]{.mark} peer-to-peer [network]{.mark} that tracks
transactions and maintains a complete history of verified
transactions]{.underline}. Media reports have outlined the notion that
some, or even [many, **[terrorist]{.mark} organization[s]{.mark}
[have]{.mark} [unlimited]{.mark}, [untraceable]{.mark} [sources]{.mark}
of digital money**, such as Bitcoin, which will be used to undermine the
successes of CTF]{.underline}.1 [Policymakers also have raised concerns
about terrorist use of digital currencies]{.underline}.2 However, [the
[challenge]{.mark} posed by cryptocurrencies [extends beyond
Bitcoin]{.mark}.]{.underline} Many new cryptocurrencies have emerged in
the past few years, including such alternative currencies (altcoins) as
Omni Layer (MasterCoin), BlackCoin, and Monero, which are touted as more
private and secure than Bitcoin. Zcash is another
**[[crypto]{.mark}currency]{.underline}** that [**[offers]{.mark} a
[higher degree of privacy]{.mark} and provides the potential [ability to
use]{.mark} and [transfer currency offline]{.mark}**, which could [make
it]{.mark} **[difficult]{.mark} for law enforcement [to trace illicit
transactions]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[[Terrorists]{.mark} [require significant funding]{.mark} to carry out
attacks and other activities.]{.underline} Indeed, there [is reason to
believe that, **[if]{.mark} terrorist [groups were better funded]{.mark}
overall**, there [might be **more**]{.mark}**-[frequent]{.mark},
more-successful, and [larger attacks]{.mark}**]{.underline}.1 There are
several reasons that support this belief. First, [more funds for
operations would presumably [lead to]{.mark} increased funding for the
structures that]{.underline} [enable these attacks, which include
[recruiting]{.mark} and [training attackers]{.mark} and
[inspiring]{.mark} potential [lone wolves]{.mark}]{.underline}. Second,
[[groups facing less monetary pressure]{.mark} (i.e., those that are
better funded) also might be [more willing to take risks]{.mark}, such
as larger or riskier attacks]{.underline}.2 Lastly, and perhaps more
contentiously, **[increased funds can be used directly for additional
and larger attacks]{.underline}.** It might be difficult to directly
link increased funds to terrorist attacks, although in specific
documented cases, ["the literature often describes **shortages of cash
as a problem for terrorist operations**."]{.underline}3 [It is therefore
plausible that the relative lack of attacks, and especially the lack of
higher-cost large attacks, is partly because of overall funding
constraints.]{.underline} Since the September 11, 2001, terrorist
attacks (9/11), law enforcement agencies have developed and implemented
several successful approaches for preventing the flow of fiat (i.e.,
government-issued) currencies to terrorist groups. In particular, as
intelligence and counterterrorism agencies have identified finance
strategies employed by terrorist organizations, they have been able to
curtail terrorist fundraising.4 However, the success of
[**counterterrorism finance** ([CTF]{.mark}) **strategies** in reducing
terrorist access to fiat currencies has **[raised]{.mark}
[concerns]{.mark} that [terrorist]{.mark} organization[s]{.mark} might
[increase]{.mark} their [use of]{.mark} such digital
[crypto]{.mark}currencies as Bitcoin [to support their
activities]{.mark}**]{.underline}.5 Bitcoin is both a protocol for
securely storing and transmitting tokens (virtual coins) and the name of
the unit of value in the system. Bitcoin revolves around a public ledger
called the blockchain, which is maintained by an online distributed
network of computers that track transactions and maintain a complete
history of verified transactions. Any user of the system can participate
in all aspects of its operations, including all transactions, and no
single participant has control. To support anonymity and transaction
ownership, Bitcoin transaction participants are identified by a unique
string of random numbers rather than by a name or other personal
information. Furthermore, the challenge posed by cryptocurrencies
extends beyond Bitcoin. [Many **new [cryptocurrencies]{.mark} have
emerged**, all with differing properties tailored for different
audiences, some of **which might [align with terrorists'
needs]{.mark}**.]{.underline} These include such other alternative
currencies ("altcoins") as Omni Layer (MasterCoin), BlackCoin, and
Monero, which are touted as more private and secure than Bitcoin and
therefore are seemingly tailor-made for illicit activities.6 Another
cryptocurrency is Zcash, which uses transactions that are not identified
by any owner, thereby offering a higher degree of privacy. Zcash also
offers a higher degree of privacy, which could make it even more
difficult for law enforcement to trace illicit transactions and could be
extended to allow offline use and transfer of the currency. Other types
of cryptocurrencies have been proposed, including Hawk, which aims to
allow fully private contracts and transactions on the Ethereum
blockchain. Like Bitcoin, the Ethereum blockchain is a distributed
computing platform and operating system. [Increased use of
cryptocurrencies by terrorists could undermine the successes of
CTF.]{.underline} [Although terrorist organizations have sometimes been
reluctant to adopt new methods when old methods are effective, **[CTF
pressures]{.mark} can [create incentives for terrorists to
innovate]{.mark}**, as we have seen in other domains]{.underline}.7
[**[We]{.mark}** might **[expect terrorist]{.mark} group[s]{.mark} [to
expand]{.mark} their use of [crypto]{.mark}currencies** [in cases where
their]{.mark} [access to]{.mark} alternative [financ]{.mark}ial systems
[is limited]{.mark}, or where cryptocurrency provides significant
benefits over alternatives.]{.underline} Some research has been
conducted on the use of cryptocurrencies by criminals and terrorist
organizations, but such research has largely focused on Bitcoin and
other first-generation cryptocurrencies (with some notable exceptions).8
Policymakers also have focused more attention on terrorists' potential
use of digital currencies, including Bitcoin. For example, in January
2018, a bill was introduced in Congress to ask the U.S. Treasury
Department to "prioritize the investigation of terrorist and illicit use
of new financial technology, including digital currencies," among other
provisions.9 There is thus a great need to understand the full potential
for terrorist use of cryptocurrencies, including options for identifying
and tracking their use, the sophistication and technological capability
of terrorist groups, and the potential for such use to increase in the
future, given expected technological developments.

Combining Generates National Security Threats. [A breakdown in
international financial market transactions in USD and in the
applications of international sanctions combine to generate a noteworthy
national security threat. At the moment, **[malign actors hid]{.mark}ing
[illegal transactions in cryptocurrency]{.mark} markets**, or renegade
companies [skirting sanctions to generate short-term profit,]{.mark}
**represent a general nuisance to the overall maintenance of the
international financial system**]{.underline}. However, [if [rogue state
actors cooperate]{.mark} to [establish their own secondary]{.mark}
[market]{.mark} system of cryptocurrency transactions to trade among
themselves, the **[effectiveness of using the global financial
system]{.mark}** to thwart these regimes **[would be significantly
challenged]{.mark}**]{.underline}**.**35 Unless rogue states coordinate
to support all import and export transactions inside a single
cryptocurrency, they would still need to convert open market
cryptocurrencies to fiat currency. [[Current]{.mark}ly, the
[crypto]{.mark}currency [space displays wild fluctuations]{.mark} in
value and [demonstrates]{.mark} the [instability]{.mark} of speculative
investments and early market normalization. Since the value of each
competing cryptocurrency remains purely based on investor confidence,
currency prices tend to increase and decrease rapidly. **[Rogue nations
releasing]{.mark} national [digital currency tied to underlying]{.mark}
[assets]{.mark}** [presents]{.mark} a **[contemporary equivalent
to]{.mark} the [gold standard]{.mark}**]{.underline}. If developed,
[[trust among rogue actors]{.mark} in other digital marketplaces could
[allow for the free flow of illicit trade]{.mark} and funding among
participant nations. Disconcertingly similar to the Cold War model, one
could imagine this type of alternative market system leading to
independent states choosing to operate in one or multiple marketplaces.
This type of parallel digital market system **[challenges]{.mark} both
[nonkinetic]{.mark} (financial markets) and [kinetic]{.mark} (DOD)
[means by which the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [might disrupt
illicit actor funding]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As of July 28, 2018, open
market cryptocurrencies represent under 1 percent of currency assets
internationally, hence they do not represent an immediate financial
market threat. However, this growing revolution in the establishment of
cryptocurrencies harkens back to concepts introduced by Frederick Hayek
in his 1976 essay, "Denationalisation of Money." Hayek proposed the need
to remove the central bank monopoly over issuance of currency, which is
the organizing principle of current cryptocurrencies. [While the USD
emerged as the stable world currency of choice, the functioning of U.S.
Federal Reserve monetary policy as the de facto World Bank leaves many
countries dissatisfied. If rogue states coordinated their efforts to
counter this actuality with support of a supranational cryptocurrency
standard for trade and exchange, this technology could [present]{.mark}
a significant [challenge to]{.mark} one of the primary tools used by the
U.S. Government and the international community to [counter]{.mark}
continuously evolving [gray area threats]{.mark} and activities of rogue
nations and [violent extremist organizations]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
current instability in cryptocurrency marketplaces presents a window of
opportunity for the United States to prepare for the revolution in
international financial payment systems

While the international financial community certainly has shown both
intrigue and aversion to the potential disruptions in world monetary
markets, distributed ledger technology also introduces challenges
pertaining to national security. [The presence of various
[middlemen]{.mark}, such as financial institutions, [afforded
governments the ability to track]{.mark} and trace [malign
activity]{.mark} through the traditional financial system ledgers. [With
cryptoc]{.mark}urrencies, **[reputable banks no longer validate]{.mark}
an individual's [credentials]{.mark}** and [record]{.mark} his
[information]{.mark} with each transaction. Rather, [anonymity]{.mark}
in cryptocurrencies [protects]{.mark} point-to-point
[transactions]{.mark} captured between digitized wallets and encryption
keys]{.underline}. [This **change in the traditional process for
managing financial transactions [undermines]{.mark} [regulatory
anti--money laundering]{.mark}** efforts performed by financial
institutions, which are intended to thwart [players]{.mark} [attempting
to **skirt sanctions**]{.mark} and **[finance terror
groups]{.mark}**.]{.underline} While perhaps not immediately obvious to
the casual observer, [nonstate actor use and increasing state actor
pursuit of cryptocurrencies extend the competitive space into the
international financial domain]{.underline} and spotlight cryptocurrency
as a national security issue that should concern the Department of
Defense (DOD) and Intelligence Community.4

[The **rapid [growth of weakly regulated]{.mark} financial and
technology [markets creates vulnerabilities]{.mark}** for safeguarding
the international financial system from malign actors. Hence, the nexus
of [crime]{.mark}, **[corruption]{.mark}**, and [terrorism]{.mark}
[finds refuge in]{.mark} these emergent financial systems]{.underline}.5
Aside from the benefits of cryptocurrencies, which include providing an
attractive means for malign actors to conceal illicit funding and
business, and to earn currency by mining, [the technology [attributes
alone attract malfeasance]{.mark}]{.underline}. While the distributed
blockchain ledger remains resistant to cyber criminals, the storage of
the digital coins (that is, private key encryptions) remains a system
weakness.

While pointed out earlier that traditional ledger systems are
vulnerable, [**[theft]{.mark} of cryptocurrencies [requires less hacking
skill]{.mark}** than penetrating the centralized ledger
systems]{.underline}, which banks have hardened. [[Secure]{.mark}
[digital storage]{.mark} of the private and public key information
associated with cryptocurrency [exists outside]{.mark} the
[blockchain]{.mark} within individual computers, exchange markets, and
businesses established to provide offline, or cold-storage]{.underline}.
Similar to a brokerage house converting shares of a company into cash
for a seller, cryptocurrency exchanges support the transition of the
digital currency back into a fiat currency like the USD. [Theft of the
[encryption keys]{.mark} for a coin [gives a criminal carte blanche to
spend]{.mark} it without the need for identification.]{.underline} Due
to the need to secure the encryption keys from theft by hackers, some
exchanges and separate businesses now exist to safeguard the encryption
keys offline in the equivalent of digital safe deposit boxes. [The
introduction of these cryptocurrency technologies disrupts not only
financial markets but also efforts to monitor and maintain the integrity
of financial exchange. The **anonymity of use, low barriers to entry,
and weak regulation and limited legal jurisdiction in the cryptocurrency
marketplace represent an opportune platform for illicit actors**. The
initial forays of criminal, corrupt, and terror networks into the
cryptocurrency markets [foreshadow the future challenges]{.mark} of
starving large-scale, bad actors of funding]{.underline}.

### IOT Bad\-\--1NC

#### The IoT is terrible \-\-- laundry list.

Jason **Bloomberg** 07/20**14** \[President of Intellyx, Wired, "7
Reasons why the Internet of Things is Doomed,"
https://www.wired.com/insights/2014/07/7-reasons-internet-things-doomed///ZW\]

To paraphrase the immortal Facebook sage, there are three things in this
world I hate: 1. Articles about buzzwords; 2: Irony; and 3: Lists. Let
us therefore proceed with all due irony to list our derogations of one
of the buzziest: the Internet of Things, known to aficionados and
curmudgeons alike as the IoT. The IoT explosion is rather curious if you
think about it, as the Internet has been with us now for nigh on two
decades, and everything connected to it has always been some kind of
thing. But now it seems every kind of thing from dishwashers to
doorknobs require an Internet connection, since after all, we all know
our dishwashers have long harbored a pent up desire for scintillating
conversation with our doorknobs. [Today, the IoT itself is a
Thing]{.underline} -- a Thing Worth Talking About it seems, from all the
conferences, confabs, and conversations it elicits. Because as we all
know, where there's attention, buckets of cash soon follow, and even the
most egregious ideas end up with their piece of the pie if only the
caterwauling is loud enough. [Yet while hype is good for business in the
short term, there's this annoying little problem we call reality that
has an inconvenient habit of throwing water all over our Wicked Witch of
Inflated Expectations]{.underline}. So, get me a bucket, and here goes.
[Security]{.underline} We all know the everyday computer gear that
vendors have been churning out for the aforementioned two decades have
matured sufficiently to prevent any kind of security breach, so it
should be no problem at all to transfer that unbreakable technology to
the various sensors and controls we now want to scatter about our homes,
our cars, and our factories. What's that you say? [Even our most mature,
robust technology simply rolls over and kowtows any time a script kiddie
with a free hacker tool decides to poke around a bit?]{.underline}
[Today that selfsame kiddie has no problem at all hacking our baby
monitors and laptop cameras]{.underline}, which should send a chill up
the spine of any online porn aficionado or parent (and for all you
porn-loving parents, fuggedaboutit). Today, [the most common IoT sensor
is the lowly RFID tag]{.underline}, found in everything from store
merchandise to warehouse equipment to passports to that "security"
(ahem) badge that gets you into your office at night. [And what kind of
security does that tag sport]{.underline}? Nada. [Nothing]{.underline}.
Zilch. [And you don't even have to touch the thing to hack
it]{.underline}. Simply [being in the general vicinity is good
enough]{.underline}. Not like your passport is ever in the general
vicinity of lowlife like you find in passport lines at airports. [Be
afraid. Be very afraid. Privacy]{.underline} -- And No, That's Not the
Same as Security Even if you can somehow secure that baby monitor and
keep the perv down the street from spying on your little bubby boo,
[there's still the problem that a lot of these IoT devices are supposed
to spy on you]{.underline}. Why do you think there are so many buckets
of cash pouring into the IoT hope-to-be-a-market? The Big Corporations
don't expect to make a big profit on the devices themselves, oh no. News
flash: [the Big Money in IoT is in Big Data]{.underline}. As in, Big
Data about everything those sensors are learning about you and your
nasty habits that you hide from your neighbors. [The value of Big Data,
after all, aren't the data themselves]{.underline}. "Fred's car told
Fred's thermostat to turn on Fred's hot tub" doesn't interest anybody
but Fred and perhaps his hot date (if he's lucky). [The value in Big
Data]{.underline}, you see, [are in the patterns]{.underline}. What
shows you watch. What apps you use. Which ads influence your buying
behavior. [The more IoT you have, the more Big Data they collect, and
the more Big Data they collect, the more they know about how you behave.
And once they know how you behave, they know how to control how you
behave]{.underline}. And that brings us to #3. [Digital
Fatigue]{.underline} Remember back in the good old days, when the trusty
old rabbit ears picked up three stations, and phones were attached to
the wall? You do? Consider yourself old then. But it's not just us gray
hairs who actually used rabbit ears who pine for the good old days of
not being quite so wired as we are today. You don't have to follow all
the angry tweets about Facebook's latest mind control scheme to realize
that people are getting fed up. Too much social media, too many
smartphones, too many YouTube videos to watch, too many apps to
download, too much of everything digital and wired and online. We can't
even go for a lovely stroll in Antarctica for heaven's sake without
checking Twitter every five minutes. What the hell is wrong with us,
anyway? Now along comes the IoT, promising to connect the Internet to
our eyeglasses and our wristwatches and our thermostats and our
appliances and our streetlights and on and on. Can't we just download a
big-ass OFF switch so we can hear ourselves freakin' THINK for once?
Please? [Ecosystems]{.underline} Ecosystems? How could there be anything
wrong with a back-to-nature, tree-hugging ecosystem? Well, I'm not
talking about natural ecosystems here. I'm talking about their evil
twin, technology ecosystems. Case in point: [smartphone
ecosystems]{.underline}. In this corner we have Apple iPhone. It has its
own programming environment with its own throng of developers coding
apps for the iPhone App Store that only run on the iPhone. And in that
corner: Google Android, with all the same stuff, only it all requires
Google under the covers. [Both Apple and Google]{.underline}, of course,
[make billions of dollars]{.underline} this way (yes, Billion with a B,
Dr. Evil!) [But consumers have to choose: which ecosystem do they want
to sell their soul to]{.underline}? Because once we consumers pick a
side, it's very difficult to cut the ties that bind us to our choice.
And for all you Windows Phone or BlackBerry fans out there? Sorry
Charlie, you bet on the nag that went lame in the back stretch. [With
the IoT we're back to square one]{.underline}, [and the Apples and
Googles of the world know that the spoils will go to the winners of the
ecosystem wars]{.underline}. Only now it's anybody's game again, so we
have a plethora of vendors, both large and small, jumping into the fray
and trying to establish a foothold, in hopes of either creating their
own ecosystem (for the startups) or extending their existing one (for
the behemoths). Don't be fooled. [Sure, all the IoT techies may be
talking about open standard]{.underline}s, in the hopes that all my
doohickeys can seamlessly interoperate with all of your gewgaws[. But
open standards are nothing more than big sticks for beating weaker
ecosystems into submission -- and that turns us, the poor consumer, into
collateral damage]{.underline}. No Killer App One day nobody heard of an
iPad. The next day everybody wanted an iPad. The day after that,
everybody had an iPad. That's what we mean by a Killer App: something
everybody wants the moment they hear about it. So far, the IoT has no
Killer App. Are you lining up for Google Glass? What about a
refrigerator that orders milk, or a car that turns on your hot tub? No?
Didn't think so. Of course, the Killer App could be just around the
corner. They have a nasty habit of appearing on the market suddenly with
no warning, after all. But so far, we ain't got nuttin'. [Enterprises
Will Mess Things Up Sure, Web Scale companies and cash-rich Silicon
Valley startups are all over the IoT]{.underline}. [But what about your
bank or big box retailer or manufacturer]{.underline}? Sure, they want
to play with the cool kids too. If only it weren't for all that legacy
technology that's weighing them down! As I wrote about in my previous
Cortex newsletter, established enterprises may attempt to relegate their
IoT efforts to their swashbuckling Digital Transformation initiatives,
thus separating them from the mundanities of their existing technology.
Only one problem: their existing technology is what runs their business.
Digital Transformation may be the frosting, but the existing business,
legacy and all, is the cake. Sorry, folks. No playing with the cool kids
until you finish your homework, and while you're at it, eat all your
Brussels sprouts too. [For an enterprise to succeed with the IoT or any
other part of their Digital Transformation initiative, there are no
shortcuts]{.underline} -- only hard work. [But even hard work will get
you nowhere if you're not working on the right problems]{.underline}.
Architecture, anyone? [Vendors Smell Blood in the Water, Only the Blood
Is Yours]{.underline} The answer to many of these problems (or at least,
a hint at how we might come up with an answer) is to put the consumer in
control of the IoT. Let the consumer control the security of each
device. Let us determine what data the devices upload to the Big
Companies. Let us set the priorities for the standards efforts. Let us
turn the damn things off when we need some peace and quiet already. In
your dreams! [There's no way to fix all the problems of IoT because
fixing the problems means putting the consumer in control, and the
consumer would promptly turn off precisely those features that are
making the VCs, entrepreneurs, and pundits salivate]{.underline}.
Remember, the Big Money is in using the IoT to control (or at least,
influence) consumer behavior -- and if we as consumers could simply turn
off those features that let the Big Companies make money off of us, then
they'd have no reason to build out the IoT in the first place. [Do I
really think the Internet of Things is doomed, or do I believe there are
solutions to these problems]{.underline}? I consider myself an optimist,
especially when it comes to technological progress, but [my core
prediction is that the IoT will struggle to find its way]{.underline}.
It will eventually arrive, but not in the forms that people envision
today. [The battle for who will control the IoT]{.underline}, the
vendors or the customers, [will bring to a head many of the concerns
people have over the influence technology already has in our
lives]{.underline}. And what about the Industrial Internet? The IoT
includes M2M, right? No, not Mary Tyler Moore, M2M is
Machine-to-Machine, as in factory equipment and power plant turbines and
locomotives and such. Sorry to disappoint -- but the Industrial Internet
is really quite different than the IoT this article has been skewering.
The difference? Nobody in their right mind would actually put a turbine
or a locomotive on the Internet -- that is, the phishing-crazy,
porn-laden, NSA-targeted Internet we all know and love. That's what
private networks are for. Right? [In the end, the IoT is a tool, just as
all technology are tools]{.underline}. Tools can be used well or poorly,
for good or for evil. And people are always going for the big bucks by
building a better mousetrap -- but the best mousetrap in the world won't
sell if your customers have a weasel infestation, of if they simply like
their mice the way they are, thank you very much. And anyway, all this
hullabaloo about the IoT misses the entire point. Whether we talk about
the things we're connecting to the IoT, or the IoT itself, never forget
that tools themselves are just things -- and this story isn't really
about things at all. Peel away all the buzzwords and hype, and you'll
find that the Internet of Things is the Internet of People -- an
extraordinarily powerful communication and commerce tool, but a tool in
human hands nevertheless. Be careful with that thing or you'll put
someone's eye out.

device in our homes could soon be equipped with sensors and connected to
the internet]{.underline}. [However, all that convenience comes with one
major drawback. IoT devices are notorious for their lack of
security]{.underline}, mostly because [manufacturers tend to neglect
that aspect in the rush to get their products to the market as soon as
possible]{.underline} and capitalize on this new opportunity.
Implementing strong security features is very expensive and
time-consuming, so manufacturers will often choose not to go through
with it, leaving these devices exposed to attacks from the outside. [The
number of IoT devices could reach 28.5 billion by 2022 The number of IoT
devices has increased exponentially in recent years, and this trend
shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon]{.underline}. In fact,
networking hardware company Cisco predicted that there will be 28.5
billion connected devices in the world by 2022. Even today, it would be
very difficult to find a household that doesn't have at least one
connected device. Cisco also estimated that the average number of
connected devices per person will grow to 3.6 by 2022. North America is
expected to spearhead the trend with 13.4 connected devices per person,
followed by Western Europe with 9.4. [As the number of IoT devices
increases, so does the number of cyberattacks directed at
them]{.underline}. According to cybersecurity company Kaspersky Lab,
[there were three times more attacks on connected devices in the first
half of 2018 than there were in the entire 2017]{.underline}.
Previously, [in the period between 2016 and 2017, the number of attacks
increased 10 times, indicating a troubling upward trend that's set to
become even more pronounced in the coming years as IoT devices become
more ubiquitous]{.underline}. How dangerous are unsecured IoT devices?
[There are a number of ways manufacturers can leave IoT devices
vulnerable to hackers, but the most common involves assigning weak
default login credentials]{.underline}. Even worse, [those credentials
often can't be changed,]{.underline} and even if they can, users are
rarely prompted to do so. [This allows hackers to easily obtain them,
sometimes with nothing more than a web searc]{.underline}h, and take
control of the compromised device. [The infamous Mirai botnet attack of
2016 still serves as the best example of just how dangerous unsecured
IoT devices can be]{.underline}. It was the most disruptive distributed
denial-of-service (DDoS) attack in history, in which [hackers gained
control of more than 100,000 poorly secured IoT devices and used them to
launch a sustained assault on the leading DNS provider Dyn, taking down
numerous important websites in the process]{.underline}, such as
Twitter, Netflix, Amazon and CNN. However, [IoT devices aren't used just
to launch DDoS attack]{.underline}s. [Hackers are also increasingly
using them to attack consumers directly and steal their personal data or
use their systems to mine cryptocurrencies]{.underline}. Princeton
University recently conducted a comprehensive study of more than 50
consumer IoT devices, including smart TVs, security cameras, smart
lightbulbs, smart smoke detectors, sleep monitors, smart blood pressure
monitors and children's toys. The study revealed that many of the
[devices tested lack even basic encryption and authentication features,
allow attackers to infer user behavior from encrypted traffic metadata,
or communicate with third parties without users' knowledge]{.underline}.
Regulatory issues [The lack of regulation is one of the biggest issues
associated with IoT devices]{.underline}, but things are starting to
change in that regard as well. The U.S. government was among the first
to take the threat posed by unsecured IoT devices seriously, introducing
a number of IoT-related bills in Congress over the last couple of years.
It all began with the IoT Cybersecurity Improvement Act of 2017, which
set minimum security standards for connected devices obtained by the
government. This legislation was followed by the SMART IoT Act, which
tasked the Department of Commerce with conducting a study of the current
IoT industry in the United States. Furthermore, California recently
became the first U.S. state to pass an IoT cybersecurity bill, which
will require manufacturers to equip all connected devices with
reasonable security features. While the bill doesn't make it clear what
those reasonable security features are exactly, it does specify that
devices that allow access from outside of a local area network need to
have either a unique default password or prompt users to choose their
own during setup. Although it's been criticized by some cybersecurity
experts for being too vague and simplistic, it nevertheless marks an
important step towards making IoT devices more secure. Other governments
are also stepping up their efforts to protect consumers from this
growing threat. The UK government released the Code of Practice for
consumer IoT security in October 2018, which sets forth guidelines for
improving the security of consumer IoT products and associated services.
Similarly, in November 2018, Germany's Federal Office for Information
Security published its suggestions for minimum security standards and
features required for broadband routers. [The number of IoT devices
continues to increase at a rapid pace, and it's becoming increasingly
clear that this technology is here to sta]{.underline}y. While they
provide numerous benefits, [IoT devices]{.underline} also [come with a
variety of security and privacy concerns]{.underline}. Until
manufacturers raise their standards and invest more in implementing
strong security features, businesses and consumers will have to do their
own part to ensure that the devices they bring into their workplaces and
homes aren't a security risk. The best way to do that is to purchase IoT
devices exclusively from manufacturers with a proven track record when
it comes to security; use unique, strong passwords for each device; and
always keep software and firmware updated. Even that won't be enough to
completely eliminate the threat, but it will at least minimize it.

#### Escalating cyberattacks on IOT causes escalation.

**Trend Micro** 07-21-20**21** \[Trend Micro, "IoT Security Issues,
Threats, and Defenses,"
https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/internet-of-things/iot-security-101-threats-issues-and-defenses//ZW\]

The internet of things (IoT) has grown so broad that the development of
its security had to quickly keep up. This article discusses the basics
of IoT security in order to help frame what it is, why it is necessary,
and how it can be achieved. What are IoT devices? We begin by defining
the "things" in the internet of things, because the diversity in IoT
devices makes the IoT's scope so broad and its security challenging.
[The main characteristics of an IoT device is that they are able to
connect to the internet and interact with its environment through the
collection and exchange of data]{.underline}. Devices commonly have
limited computing capacity and only a few specific functions. Because
devices are so diverse, there are countless ways IoT can be used and
applied to different environments. For regular users, smart homes
demonstrate just how accessible IoT devices are. Users can update their
home's security system (through smart locks, IP cameras, and motion
sensors) or improve their entertainment system (through a smart TV,
smart speakers, and connected game consoles) by simply buying such
devices. IoT devices are also often portable and can be connected to any
network. A typical example is how users bring their devices from their
homes to the office (e.g. smart watches and e-readers). While diversity
can give users countless devices to choose from, it is one of the
reasons behind the fragmentation of the IoT and carries many of its
security concerns. The lack of industry foresight and standardization
has given rise to compatibility issues that also complicate the matter
of security. The portability of devices presents a greater possibility
of threats poisoning more than one network. Compounding to these
concerns are other factors that IoT security must address. What are the
security issues in the IoT? [While IoT devices play a huge role in the
discussion of IoT security, placing all the focus on this aspect of the
IoT does not provide a full picture of why security is necessary and
what it entails]{.underline}. There are many factors that make IoT
security critical today. [Threats and risks IoT security is critical
largely because of the expanded attack surface of threats that have
already been plaguing networks]{.underline}. Adding to these threats are
insecure practices among users and organizations who may not have the
resources or the knowledge to best protect their IoT ecosystems. [These
security issues include]{.underline} the following:
[Vulnerabilities]{.underline}**.** Vulnerabilities are a large problem
that constantly plague users and organizations. One of the main reasons
[IoT devices are vulnerable is because they lack the computational
capacity for built-in security]{.underline}. Another reason that
[vulnerabilities can be]{.underline} so [pervasive is the limited budget
for developing and testing secure firmware,]{.underline} which is
influenced by the price point of devices and their very short
development cycle. Vulnerable standard components also affect millions
of devices, as demonstrated by Ripple20 and URGENT/11. Aside from the
devices themselves, [vulnerabilities in web applications and related
software for IoT devices can lead to compromised systems]{.underline}.
[Malware operators are on the lookout for such opportunities and are
knowledgeable even about older vulnerabilities]{.underline}. [Malware.
Despite the limited computing capacity of most IoT devices, they can
still be infected by malware]{.underline}. [This is something
cybercriminals have used to great effect in the past few
years]{.underline}. [IoT botnet malware are among the most frequently
seen variants, as they are both versatile and profitable for
cybercriminals]{.underline}. The most notable attack was in 2016, when
Mirai took down major websites and services using an army of ordinary
IoT devices. Other malware families include cryptocurrency mining
malware and ransomware. [Escalated cyberattacks]{.underline}**.**
Infected devices are often used for distributed-denial-of-service (DDoS)
attacks. [Hijacked devices can also be used as an attack base to infect
more machines and mask malicious activity]{.underline}, or as an entry
point for lateral movement in a corporate network. While organizations
may seem like the more profitable targets, [smart homes also see a
surprising number of unforeseen cyberattacks]{.underline}. [Information
theft and unknown exposure]{.underline}**.** As with anything dealing
with the internet[, connected devices increase the chances of exposure
online]{.underline}. Important technical and even personal information
can be unknowingly stored and targeted in these devices. [Device
mismanagement and misconfiguration.]{.underline} [Security oversights,
poor password hygiene, and overall device mismanagement can assist in
the success of these threats.]{.underline} Users may also simply lack
the knowledge and the capability to implement proper security measures,
wherein service providers and manufacturers may need to help their
customers achieve better protection. [Emerging issues The lack of
industry foresight gave little time to develop strategies and defenses
against familiar threats in growing IoT ecosystems]{.underline}.
Anticipating emerging issues is one of the reasons research on IoT
security must be done continuously. Here are some of the emerging issues
that need to be monitored: [Complex environments]{.underline}**.** In
2020, [most U.S. households had access to an average of 10 connected
devices]{.underline}. This research paper defined complex IoT
environments as an interconnected web of at least 10 IoT devices[. Such
an environment is nearly impossible for people to oversee and control
because of its elaborate web of interconnected functions]{.underline}.
[An overlooked misconfiguration in such a scenario can have dire
consequences and even put the physical household security at
risk]{.underline}. [Prevalence of remote work
arrangements]{.underline}**.** The Covid-19 pandemic has usurped many
expectations for the year 2020. It brought about large-scale
work-from-home (WFH) arrangements for organizations around the globe and
pushed heavier reliance on home networks. IoT devices also proved useful
for many users' WHF setups. These changes have highlighted the need to
reexamine IoT security practices. [5G connectivity]{.underline}**.** The
transition to 5G comes with much anticipation and expectations. It is a
development that will also enable other technologies to evolve. At
present, much of the research on 5G remains largely focused on how it
will affect enterprises and how they can implement it securely. [The
possible consequences of IoT attacks]{.underline} Aside from the threats
themselves, their [consequences in the context of the IoT can be much
more damaging to deal with]{.underline}. The IoT has the unique
capability of affecting both virtual and physical systems. [Cyberattacks
on IoT ecosystems]{.underline} could have far more unpredictable effects
because they [translate more easily into physical
consequences]{.underline}. This is most prominent in the field of
industrial internet of things (IIoT), where past cyberattacks had
already demonstrated cascading consequences. [In the healthcare
industry, IoT devices are already being utilized to remotely monitor
patients' vital signs and has proven very helpful during the pandemic.
Attacks on such devices can expose sensitive patient information or even
endanger their health and safety]{.underline}. [In the smart home,
exposed devices could allow cybercriminals to monitor the
household]{.underline}, compromise security devices like smart locks,
and turn devices against their owners, as was the case when a baby
monitor and a smart thermostat were hacked in separate attacks. How to
secure the IoT [There is no instant fix]{.underline} that can answer the
security issues and threats laid out in this article. Specific
strategies and tools may be necessary for properly securing more
specialized systems and aspects of the IoT. However, users can apply a
few best practices to reduce risks and prevent threats: **Assign an
administrator of things.** Having a person act as an administrator of
IoT devices and the network can help minimize security oversights and
exposures. They will be in charge of ensuring IoT device security, even
at home. The role is critical especially during this time of WFH setups,
where IT experts have limited control in securing home networks that now
have a stronger influence on work networks. **Regularly check for
patches and updates.** Vulnerabilities are a major and constant issue in
the field of the IoT. This is because vulnerabilities can come from any
layer of IoT devices. Even older vulnerabilities are still being used by
cybercriminals in order to infect devices, demonstrating just how long
unpatched devices can stay online. **Use strong and unique passwords for
all accounts.** Strong passwords help prevent many cyberattacks.
Password managers can help users create unique and strong passwords that
users can store in the app or software itself. **Prioritize Wi-Fi
security.** Some of the ways users can do this include enabling the
router firewall, disabling WPS and enabling the WPA2 security protocol,
and using a strong password for Wi-Fi access. Ensuring secure router
settings is also a big part of this step. **Monitor baseline network and
device behavior.** Cyberattacks can be difficult to detect. Knowing the
baseline behavior (speed, typical bandwidth, etc.) of devices and the
network can help users watch for deviations that hint at malware
infections. **Apply network segmentation.** Users can minimize the risk
of IoT-related attacks by creating an independent network for IoT
devices and another for guest connections. Network segmentation also
helps prevent the spread of attacks, and isolate possibly problematic
devices that cannot be immediately taken offline. **Secure the network
and use it to strengthen security.** IoT devices can place networks at
risk, but networks can also serve as levelled ground through which users
can implement security measures that cover all connected devices.
**Secure IoT-cloud convergence and apply cloud-based solutions.** The
IoT and the cloud are becoming increasingly integrated. It is important
to look at the security implications of each technology to the other.
Cloud-based solutions can also be considered to deliver added security
and processing capabilities to IoT edge devices. **Consider security
solutions and tools.** A large hurdle that users face in trying to
secure their IoT ecosystems is the limited capacity in which they can
implement these steps. Some device settings might have restricted access
and are difficult to configure. In such cases users can supplement their
efforts by considering security solutions that provide multi-layered
protection and endpoint encryption. **Take into consideration the
different protocols used by IoT devices.** To communicate, IoT devices
use not only internet protocols, but also a huge set of different
networking protocols, from the well-known Bluetooth and Near Field
Communication (aka NFC), to the lesser-known nRF24, nRFxx, 443MHz, LoRA,
LoRaWAN and optical, infrared communication. Administrators must
understand the whole set of protocols used in their IoT systems in order
to reduce risks and prevent threats. **Secure the heavy use of GPS.**
Some IoT devices and applications use GPS heavily, which carries
potential security concerns. Organizations, in particular, need to be
wary of cases where GPS signals can be jammed or even faked, especially
if they use positioning systems for manufacturing, monitoring, and other
functions. If these positioning systems are crucial to a company, means
of monitoring the GPS signal should then also exist in the company.
Another option would be for the company to use other positioning systems
as well, such as Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) or Differential GNSS (DGNSS
or DGPS). [Aside from employing these security practices, users should
also be aware of new developments in the technology]{.underline}. IoT
security has been given heavier consideration in recent times. Research
is continually being done on how to secure specific industries, monitor
IoT-related threats, and prepare for upcoming gamechangers such as 5G.
Users must understand that the IoT is an active and developing field,
therefore its [security will always have to transform and adapt to its
changes]{.underline}.

#### Vulnerabilities in critical infrastructure could be exploited.

Tom **Brewster** 03-20-20**14** \[Writing for the Guardian, The
Guardian, "There are real and present dangers around the Internet of
Things,"
https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/mar/20/internet-of-things-security-dangers//ZW\]

[As with any buzz topic in the tech world, there's a lot of bunkum
around the Internet of Things]{.underline}. And in the security sphere,
there's much unnecessary FUD - Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt -- spread by
industry vendors to get people suitably scared so they splash cash on
purportedly necessary protection.  Take the case of the spamming
refrigerator. Researchers suggested the smart fridge had been
compromised to relay reams of annoying emails, as often happens to
normal PCs. Yet Symantec discovered the fridge was simply on the same
network and using the same IP address as a hacked Windows PC, which was
really the thing responsible for the spam. Digital listeria this was
not. Yet [there are reasons to be fearful of the Internet of
Things]{.underline} (IoT), a name covering the networks of embedded
devices, from smart meters to connected automobiles, which communicate
with each other in an automated fashion to help make our lives more
efficient. Such connected, autonomous machines have been around for
years, but the reason it is now on the tips of tech firms' PR tongues
every day is that the number of connected devices is escalating rapidly
into new areas, like toothbrushes and bathtubs. According to Gartner
estimates, the IoT will consist of 26 billion units by 2020, and by that
time the industry will be worth \$300 billion. [The problem is that many
of the manufacturers of these machines are not taking the
secure-by-design approach]{.underline}. "[They are learning on the job
at this point in time]{.underline}," says Gunter Ollmann, chief
technology officer at IOActive, a consultancy firm that has done much
research on IoT security. [Hacking vehicles There are a handful of real
and present threats]{.underline}. In automobiles, trucks are a major
concern. Many contain standardised code to manage vehicles, such as the
control area network (CAN) bus protocol, used for internal
communications between devices in a vehicle. "CAN messages that control
physical attributes are standardised. Therefore, if you figure out a
hack for one manufacturer others will be quite similar if not
identical," says Chris Valasek, director of security intelligence for
IOActive.  [One of the functions that has understandably worried
onlookers in the trucking and security industries is the kill switch
that powers the vehicles down]{.underline}. "Some fleets use the GPS
tracking and 'check-out' systems to control access to the trucks when
they are in depots or secure overnight storage locations to prevent the
truck being stolen," Ollmann adds. "The open architecture of the trucks
CAM bus has made it much easier for the integration of fleet tracking
and control technologies like these. But c[onceptually, any wireless
technology that can receive remote commands and affect the operation of
a truck is a potential target for researchers and targets]{.underline}.
What if someone figures out the master shutdown code for all the trucks,
and they get all the trucks in London to stop at 7am?" It's a nasty
thought, but this isn't science fiction. Trucking companies are working
with Ollmann and his team to close off any potential flaws that could
lead to disaster. "We're working with some of them and doing additional
research on this now ... they're worried about it." The car industry is
alive to the problems too, at least in its more progressive corners.
When Valasek and noted security researcher Chris Miller showed on video
how they could hack a car when inside the vehicle (below), it gave rise
to both mirth and misery in the car industry.  Tesla has reacted the
most positively. Having recruited some noted security pros, including
former Apple "hacker princess" Kristin Paget, it has set up a
vulnerability disclosure programme rewarding researchers for uncovering
flaws. It's similar to bug bounty programmes run by major software
firms, like Facebook, Google and Microsoft. Evidently, the Rubicon has
been crossed.  [Hacking the home The home is a viable target
too]{.underline}, amusingly highlighted by the discovery of a hackable
Japanese smart toilet last year. More recently, IOActive detailed flaws
in home automation kit made by Belkin, including switches to turn
electrical devices on and off, which could have been used to cause
real-world damage, possibly a fire. Those vulnerabilities were
eventually addressed, but Ollmann says there are numerous flaws in
connected home technologies from other manufacturers that will be
disclosed in the near future. TVs that run Google's Android operating
system are vulnerable to many of the same attacks that affect
smartphones. MWR Infosecurity, a consultancy, has tested out an Android
exploit on a Kogan TV running Android. The attack took advantage of a
documented weaknesses that allow hackers to use of a piece of code known
as a JavaScriptInterface, included in ad libraries to let further
actions be initiated on Android machines. [In theory, anyone hacking a
TV in this way could take photos, if the TV had a built-in camera, or
create invasive applications to spy on viewers]{.underline}. That
weakness has been found in numerous ad libraries used by many of the
world's top free apps. "It should affect any TV running Android and
definitely if they're running apps which use the flawed ad networks,"
says David Chismon, researcher at MWR.  [Home routers are ridden with
vulnerabilities too]{.underline}, as uncovered by digital security
non-profit Team Cymru in March. It found a network of 300,000 home and
office routers had been compromised, thanks to worrying weaknesses in
the devices' software, from predictable or non-existent passwords to
flaws in the web applications used to control them. [The hackers decided
to use these security holes to redirect victims to whatever website they
wanted when they started using the internet]{.underline}.  [Taking over
industrial controls]{.underline} Connected, and therefore hackable,
[devices can also be found in control systems running nations' critical
infrastructure.]{.underline} [Researchers across the world have been
panicking about supervisory control and data acquisition]{.underline}
(SCADA) [systems]{.underline}, [used to monitor and manage industrial
machines, from nuclear power plants to oil and gas
pipelines]{.underline}.   [SCADA machines produced by various
manufacturers have been shown to contain various weaknesses, like those
exploited by Stuxnet]{.underline}, the infamous malware that disrupted
centrifuges at an Iranian nuclear plant. [What's worrying is that more
vulnerabilities continue to emerge]{.underline}.  In January, the US
government's Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team
(ICS-CERT) issued a warning about a buffer overflow vulnerability, a
type of weakness that allows an outside hacker to write code to a device
and which has been largely eradicated from modern systems. The Guardian
knows of one major security firm that is aware of a number of
theoretical flaws, ones that could be used to play with the power
controls on SCADA systems, but they do not currently have the right labs
to test the potential for real-world impact. This is another key
problem: [the threat is poorly understood, with many apparent
vulnerabilities that may or may not be exploited to endanger critical
infrastructure]{.underline}. "We keep seeing small examples of attacks
that may or may not be cyber attacks against SCADA systems, but it's
still a theoretical threat in terms of spectacular and long lived
degradation of a specific service," says Steve Santorelli, a researcher
at Cymru. His outlook for the future of SCADA-like machines is not
optimistic, though. "[The internet is not secure]{.underline} frankly,
[in any way at all]{.underline}. That matters when it comes to control
systems."  Send in the Cavalry Santorelli has a similarly bleak
prospectus for IoT in general. "Someone asked me recently: is my fridge
going to DDoS me and, frankly the answer is, yes ... probably," he adds.
"Anything with an IP address is a commodity in the underground economy,
to be bought or bartered for if there is a way to make money from it."u
"[The privacy and criminal implications are diverse and they need to be
at the heart of the design of these new technologies]{.underline}. [The
bottom line is that we've never truly seen security be at the heart of a
new technology and anything that connects to the internet will be
inherently insecure by its very nature.]{.underline} [The future is not
looking bright]{.underline}."= Time to batten down the hatches and
prepare for cybergeddon then? Perhaps not. Help is on the way, even if
it's not from government. A movement started by noted security
professional Josh Corman has been gathering pace in recent months, since
it was first conceived at last year's DEFCON hacking convention. Its
name is I Am The Cavalry. Its intention is to act as a hub for
vulnerability research that affects four areas: medical devices,
automobiles, home services and public infrastructure. The plan is to
give altruistic researchers a place to share their findings in a pro
bono fashion, in the hope that the weaknesses will be covered off by
whatever manufacturers are affected. I Am The Cavalry will act as a
hyperactive middleman, coordinating vulnerability disclosures and
pushing for more than just quick fixes. It wants to encourage total
cultural change to instil security across organisations' processes. It's
an ambitious plan, born out of a sense of responsibility in a world
ridden with hackable technologies. But will researchers really give away
their secrets for free, especially the most technically gifted who can
make millions by selling just a handful of the most serious flaws to
nation states? Corman believes the ethical side of the hacking community
will come out in force. "I'm not making an economic argument yet," he
says. "Our role and what sets us apart is that we're speaking to those
who have something in them \... that altruistic gene. We're describing
something that is a shared risk and a shared concern and if that appeals
to someone, they should gravitate to us." Praise for Tesla Even ahead of
its formation as an official organisation (it is consulting with lawyers
on whether to become an educational foundation or an industry
association), I Am The Cavalry has already facilitated some
vulnerability disclosures. Corman says the body has had successes in
both the car and medical industries, but can't disclose whom they
involved. He has also been invited to consult with car manufacturers in
the US and Europe, and is particularly impressed with the way in which
Tesla has responded to the problems at hand.  "We are very encouraged to
see such a policy \[at Tesla\]. A fear we've had as a research community
is that we would have a 10-15 year learning curve where this new
industry was in the denial and lawsuit stage towards researchers," says
Corman. "If this is an indicator of how the rest of the automotive
industry will respond in kind, this will dramatically accelerate the
maturity and the engagement of white hat researchers who wish to help."
As a sign of his sway with mandarins walking the murky halls of power,
Corman has already met with Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts, who
recently urged car makers to act on cyber security issues, and others on
Capitol Hill to discuss the weaknesses that urgently need addressing.
[Despite limited "in the wild" attacks, Internet of Things threats are
real]{.underline}. As connected devices proliferate, the hope is that
they do so securely. If they volunteer for the Cavalry, that might just
happen. Then we can go about our quotidian lives feeling a little less
insecure.

#### Public utilities and healthcare devices get hacked.

**Trend Micro** 09-17-20**15** \[Trend Micro, "FBI Warns Public on the
Danger of the Internet of Things,"
https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/internet-of-things/fbi-warns-public-on-dangers-of-the-internet-of-things//ZW\]

[The FBI has a rather different approach towards the Internet of Things,
saying that users should deal with IoT devices with
caution]{.underline}; [otherwise they should keep it off the
internet]{.underline}. [In a Public Service announcement]{.underline}
issued last week, [the law enforcement agency discussed the potential
security risks of using interconnected devices such as smart light
bulbs, connected cars, smart fridges, wearables, and other home security
systems. The PSA included network connected printers as well as fuel
monitoring systems]{.underline}. According to the PSA's list of IoT
risks, [cybercriminals can take advantage of system and human
vulnerabilities by exploiting these weaknesses with IoT's deficient
security capabilities and patching difficulties]{.underline}. The FBI
also cited that the lack of consumer awareness can open windows of
opportunities for attackers to not only execute online attacks, but
threaten the physical safety of consumers as well. [It's Not Just Smart
Devices or Home Security Systems Anymore Since the conception of IoT,
we've seen several incidents that involved attacks on smart home systems
and devices, and the prevalent smartification process could only mean
new security challenges]{.underline}. [With the new developments in
public-facing technologies, risks and actual attacks aren\'t limited to
IoT devices, and are becoming widespread among public utilities as
well]{.underline}. [Car hacking]{.underline}, or the exploitation of
vulnerabilities in new built-in automotive smart systems, [has become an
eye-opening reality for many security researchers and
consumers]{.underline}. According to German security specialist Dieter
Spaar, vulnerabilities in the BMW ConnectedDrive technology could allow
attackers to gain control of vehicles and enable them to remotely access
related function apps. Last July, vehicle security researchers Chris
Valasek and Charlie Miller demonstrated how a Jeep Cherokee's brakes and
other critical control systems can be remotely controlled by anyone with
an internet connection. According to Valasek and Miller, they can easily
take control of the vehicle by sending data to its interconnected
entertainment system and navigation system via a mobile phone network.
In response to this, Chrysler announced the recall of 1.4 million
vehicles that may be affected by the security hole. [As if hacking
vehicles isn't enough, attackers have also begun targeting healthcare
devices]{.underline}, [traffic light controls, and energy or industrial
systems like gas-tank-monitoring systems]{.underline}. Last month, Trend
Micro published a research paper that discussed the possible risks that
internet-facing components could come up against. It was noted that the
type of attack would depend on the sophistication of the systems, as
less complex ones can limit what attackers could do. The real-world
implications of these incidents and findings highlight the lack of
security surrounding interconnected devices and prove that attackers are
scaling more security walls within the IoT landscape. **How We Can
Prepare for IoT-related Risks?** While smart devices and systems are
making life easier for its users, the steady adoption of the Internet of
Things and the integration of more smart systems into critical
infrastructures are making many industries and consumers more vulnerable
to attacks---possibly with life-threatening repercussions. With
cybercriminals looking past desktops and mobile devices, consumers must
be more careful when it comes to the security of internet-connected
devices and systems. While we look to law enforcement agencies to help
fight against possible attacks, we must remind and teach ourselves about
the risks and dangers of insecure devices and systems. In addition to
the tips in the article entitled "What to Consider When Buying a Smart
Device", here a few more ways to improve the security of your devices
against possible IoT threats: Enable all security features on all smart
devices Always update the device firmware Use secure passwords Close any
unused ports on devices and routers Utilize encryption for all networks
and devices

[Many pro-nuclear people came to believe that the accident was proof
that the dominant form of nuclear reactor]{.underline}, which is cooled
by water, [is fatally flawed]{.underline}. They called for radically
different kinds of reactors to make the technology "inherently safe."

But now, [eight years after Fukushima, the best-available science
clearly shows that Caldicott's estimate of the number of people killed
by nuclear accidents was off by one million]{.underline}. [Radiation
from Chernobyl will kill, at most, 200 people]{.underline}, while the
[radiation from Fukushima and Three Mile Island will kill zero
people.]{.underline}

In other words, the main [lesson that should be drawn from the worst
nuclear accidents is that nuclear energy has always been **inherently
safe.**]{.underline}

The Shocking Truth

The truth about nuclear power's safety is so shocking that it's worth
[taking a closer look at the worst accidents]{.underline}, starting with
the worst of the worst: Chernobyl.

The nuclear plant is in Ukraine which, in 1986, the year of the
accident, was a Soviet Republic. [Operators lost control of an
unauthorized experiment that resulted in the reactor
catching]{.underline} [fire]{.underline}.

There was [no containment dome]{.underline}, and [the fire spewed out
radioactive particulate matter, which went all over the
world]{.underline}, leading many to conclude that Chernobyl is not just
the worst nuclear accident in history but is also [the **worst nuclear
accident possible**]{.underline}.

[Twenty-eight firefighters died]{.underline} after putting out the
Chernobyl fire. While the death of any firefighter is tragic, it's worth
[putting that number in perspective. [Eighty-six firefighters died in
the
U.S.](https://apps.usfa.fema.gov/firefighter-fatalities/fatalityData/list?deathYear=2018&offset=80&max=10) in
2018, and 343 firefighters died during the September 11, 2001 terrorist
attacks.]{.underline}

Since the Chernobyl accident, [19 first responders have
died,]{.underline} according to the [[United
Nations]{.underline}](http://www.unscear.org/docs/publications/2008/UNSCEAR_2008_Annex-D-CORR.pdf),
for "various reasons" including tuberculosis, cirrhosis of the liver,
heart attacks, and trauma. The U.N. concluded that "[the assignment of
radiation as the cause of death has become less clear."]{.underline}

What about cancer? By 2065 there may be 16,000 thyroid cancers; to date
there have
been [[6,000]{.underline}](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3107017/).
Since thyroid cancer has a mortality rate of just one percent --- it is
an easy cancer to treat --- expected deaths may be 160.

The World Health Organization claims on its web site that Chernobyl
could result in the premature deaths of 4,000 people, but according to
Dr. Geraldine Thomas, who started and runs the Chernobyl Tissue Bank,
that [number is based on a disproven methodology.]{.underline}

"That WHO number is based on LNT," she explained, using the acronym for
the "linear no-threshold" method of extrapolating deaths from radiation.

[LNT assumes that there is no threshold below which radiation is
safe,]{.underline} but that [assumption has been discredited over recent
decades]{.underline} by multiple sources of data.

[Support for the idea that radiation is harmless at low
levels]{.underline} comes from the fact that [people who live in places
with higher background radiation, like Colorado, do not suffer elevated
rates of cancer]{.underline}.

In fact, residents of Colorado, where radiation is higher because of
high concentrations of uranium in the ground, [enjoy some of the [lowest
cancer
rates](https://coloradosun.com/2019/02/04/colorado-skin-cancer-rates/) in
the U.S.]{.underline}

[Even relatively high doses of radiation cause far less harm than most
people think]{.underline}. Careful, large, and long-term studies of
survivors of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki offer
compelling demonstration.

Cancer rates were [[just 10 percent
higher]{.underline}](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/08/160811120353.htm) among
atomic blast survivors, most of whom never got cancer. Even those who
received a dose 1,000 times higher than today's safety limit saw their
lives cut short by an average of 16 months.

But didn't the Japanese government recently award a financial settlement
to the family of a Fukushima worker who claimed his cancer was from the
accident?

It did, but for reasons that were [[clearly
political,]{.underline}](https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelshellenberger/2018/09/06/top-scientist-says-japans-decision-to-financially-reward-fukushima-worker-is-not-based-on-science/) and
having to do with the Japanese government's consensus-based,
conflict-averse style, as well as lingering guilt felt by elite
policymakers toward Fukushima workers and residents, who felt doubly
aggrieved by the tsunami and meltdowns.

The worker's cancer was highly unlikely to have come from Fukushima
because, once again, the level of radiation workers received was far
lower than the ones received by the Hiroshima/Nagasaki cohort that saw
(modestly) higher cancer rates.

What about Three Mile Island? After the accident in 1979, Time
Magazine ran a cover story that superimposed a glowing headline,
"Nuclear Nightmare," over an image of the plant. Nightmare? More like a
dream. What other major industrial technology can suffer a catastrophic
failure and not kill anyone?

Remember when the Deepwater Horizon oil drilling rig caught on fire
and [[killed
11]{.underline}](https://www.britannica.com/event/Deepwater-Horizon-oil-spill-of-2010) people?
Four months later, a Pacific Gas & Electric natural gas pipeline
exploded just south of San Francisco and [[killed
eight]{.underline}](https://abc7news.com/news/pg-e-receives-maximum-sentence-for-2010-san-bruno-explosion/1722674/) people
sleeping in their beds. And that was just one year, 2010.

The [worst energy accident of all time was the 1975 collapse of the
Banqiao hydroelectric dam in China]{.underline}. It collapsed and
[killed
between [170,000](https://timeline.com/structural-failure-banqiao-china-7a402a25bb65) and [230,000
people](https://www.ozy.com/flashback/230000-died-in-a-dam-collapse-that-china-kept-secret-for-years/91699).]{.underline}

[Nuclear's worst accidents show that the technology has always been safe
for the same]{.underline}, inherent reason that it has [always had such
a small environmental impact: the **high** **energy density of its
fuel**.]{.underline}

[Splitting atoms to create heat, rather than than splitting chemical
bonds through fire]{.underline}, **[requires tiny amounts of
fuel]{.underline}**. A [single Coke can of uranium can provide enough
energy for an entire high-energy life.]{.underline}

[When the worst occurs, and the fuel melts, the amount of particulate
matter that escapes from the plant is **insignificant**]{.underline} in
[contrast to both the fiery explosions of fossil fuels and the daily
emission of particulate matter from fossil- and biomass-burning homes,
cars, and power plants, which [kill seven million
people](https://www.who.int/airpollution/en/) a year.]{.underline}

[[Before the accident, it was easier to accept]{.mark} the industry's
potential [risks]{.mark},]{.underline} because nuclear power plants had
kept many coal and gas plants from spewing air pollutants and greenhouse
gases into the air. Afterward, [the **[falling cost of renewable
power]{.mark}** [changed the calculus]{.mark}]{.underline}. Despite
working in the industry for more than a decade, I now believe that
[nuclear power's [benefits are]{.mark} [no longer enough]{.mark} to risk
the welfare of people living near these plants]{.underline}. I became so
convinced that, years after departing office, I've now made alternative
energy development my new career, leaving nuclear power behind. [The
current and potential costs --- in lives and dollars --- are just too
high.]{.underline} Nuclear plants generate power through fission, the
separation of one large atom into two or more smaller ones. This atomic
engine yields none of the air pollutants produced by the combustion of
carbon-based fuels. Over the decades since its inception in the 1950s,
nuclear power has prevented hundreds of fossil-fuel plants from being
built, meaning fewer people have suffered or died from diseases caused
by their emissions. But [fission reactors have a dark side]{.underline},
too: [If the [energy]{.mark} they produce [is not closely controlled,
they can **fail in catastrophic ways** that **kill people** and]{.mark}
**[render large tracts]{.mark} of land [uninhabitable]{.mark}**.
[Nuclear power is]{.mark} also [**the path to nuclear weapons**,]{.mark}
themselves **[an existential threat]{.mark}**.]{.underline} As the
certainty of climate change grew clearer, nuclear power presented a
dilemma for environmentalists: Was the risk of accidents or further
spread of nuclear weapons greater than the hazard of climate change? In
the late 2000s, the arguments in support of nuclear power were gaining
traction with Congress, academia and even some environmentalists, as the
Chernobyl accident faded into the past and the effects of climate change
became harder to ignore. No new plants had been proposed in decades,
because of the industry's dismal record of construction oversight and
cost controls, but now [utilities were beginning to pitch new reactors
--- as many as 30 around the country.]{.underline} But the
[[Fukushima]{.mark} Daiichi crisis]{.underline} reversed that momentum.
[A massive release of radiation from that plant, as its four reactors
failed, lasted for months. The world watched as hydrogen explosions sent
huge chunks of concrete into the air --- a reminder that radiation was
streaming, unseen, from the reactor core. More than 100,000 people were
evacuated from their homes and their communities]{.underline}. Most have
not returned, because [only select areas have been remediated, making
the surrounding region seem like a giant chessboard with hazardous areas
next to safer ones. The crisis **[hobbled the Japanese economy for
years]{.mark}**. The government estimated that the accident would cost
at least \$180 billion. Independent estimates suggest that the cost
could be three times more.]{.underline} There were obvious ramifications
for the entire industry: [Could what happened in Japan happen
elsewhere?]{.underline} This accident consumed my work at the NRC for
the next six months. I assured the public of the safety of U.S. plants,
because I did not have enough information or a legal basis at that point
to say otherwise. But I also promised to thoroughly review the safety
measures we had in place and to swiftly implement any necessary reforms
the agency identified. Agency staffers soon produced a reasonable set of
plant improvements that would reduce the chance of a similar accident
here. The [staff found weaknesses in the programs for dealing with
[fires, earthquakes and flooding]{.mark} --- the kinds of natural
disasters that [could trigger a catastrophe]{.mark} like
Fukushima.]{.underline} Yet after the disaster, my fellow commissioners,
as well as many in Congress and the nuclear industry, fretted that the
proposed new U.S. reactors might never be built, because Fukushima would
focus too much attention on the potential downsides. Westinghouse and
the new [plant owners worried that acknowledging the need for reforms
would raise even more concern about the safety of reactors. The industry
wanted the NRC to say that everything was fine and nothing needed to
change]{.underline}. So my colleagues on the commission and supporters
of the industry pushed to license the first of these projects without
delay and stonewalled implementation of the safety reforms. My
colleagues objected to making the staff report public. I ultimately
prevailed, but then the lobbying intensified: The industry almost
immediately started pushing back on the staff report. They lobbied the
commission and enlisted allies in Congress to disapprove, water down or
defer many of the recommendations. Within a year of the accident at
Fukushima --- and over my objections --- [the NRC implemented just a few
of the modest safety reforms that the agency's employees had proposed,
and then approved the first four new reactor licenses in decades, in
Georgia and in South Carolina.]{.underline} But there was a problem.
After Fukushima, people all over the world demanded a different approach
to nuclear safety. [Germany closed several older plants and required the
rest to shut down by 2022. Japan closed most of its plants. Last year,
even France, which gets about 80 percent of its electricity from nuclear
power, proposed reducing that figure to 50 percent]{.underline} by 2035,
[because **[safety could not be guaranteed]{.mark}**. **Trying to make
accidents unlikely wasn't enough**.]{.underline} And here in the United
States, those four new reactors --- the vanguard of the "nuclear
renaissance" --- still haven't opened. The South Carolina companies
building two of the reactors canceled the project in 2017, after
spending \$9 billion of their customers' money without producing a
single electron of power. The construction company behind the utilities,
Westinghouse, went bankrupt, almost destroying its parent company, the
global conglomerate Toshiba. The other two reactors licensed while I
chaired the NRC are still under construction in Georgia and years behind
schedule. Their cost has ballooned from \$14 billion to \$28 billion and
continues to grow. History shows that [the expense involved in nuclear
power will never change. Past construction in the United States
exhibited similar cost increases throughout the design, engineering and
construction process. The technology and the safety needs are just too
complex and demanding to translate into a facility that is simple to
design and build. No matter your views on nuclear power in principle, no
one can afford to pay this much for two electricity plants.]{.underline}
New nuclear is simply off the table in the United States. After I left
the NRC in 2012, I argued that we needed new ways to prevent accidents
altogether. When a reactor incident occurs, the plant should not release
any harmful radiation outside the plant itself. I was not yet
antinuclear, just pro-public-safety. But nuclear proponents still see
this as "antinuclear." They knew, as I did, that most plants operating
today do not meet the "no off-site release" test. I think a reasonable
standard for any source of electricity should be that it doesn't
contaminate your community for decades. Coal and natural gas do not
create this kind of acute accident hazard, though they do present a
different kind of danger. Large dams for hydroelectric power could
require evacuation of nearby communities if they failed --- but without
the lasting contamination effect of radiation. And **[[solar, wind and
geothermal]{.mark} energy [pose no safety threat]{.mark} at
all.]{.underline}** For years, my concerns about nuclear energy's cost
and safety were always tempered by a growing fear of climate
catastrophe. But [Fukushima provided a good test of just how important
nuclear power was to slowing climate change:]{.underline} In the months
after the accident, all nuclear reactors in Japan were shuttered
indefinitely, eliminating production of almost all of the country's
carbon-free electricity and about 30 percent of its total electricity
production. Naturally, carbon emissions rose, and future
emissions-reduction targets were slashed. Would shutting down plants all
over the world lead to similar results? [[Eight years after
Fukushima]{.mark},]{.underline} that question has been answered. [Fewer
than 10 of [Japan's]{.mark} 50 reactors have resumed operations, yet the
country's carbon [emissions]{.mark} have [dropped below their levels
before the accident]{.mark}]{.underline}. How? [[Japan]{.mark} has
[made]{.mark} significant [gains in]{.mark} energy [efficiency and
solar]{.mark} power]{.underline}. It turns out that [relying on
[nuclear]{.mark} energy [is]{.mark} actually [a bad strategy for
combating climate change]{.mark}: [One accident wiped out Japan's carbon
gains.]{.mark} [Only a turn to renewables]{.mark} and conservation
[brought the country back]{.mark} on target.]{.underline} What about the
United States? [Nuclear accounts for about 19 percent of U.S.
electricity production]{.underline} and most of our carbon-free
electricity. [Could reactors be phased out here without increasing
carbon emissions? If it were completely up to the free market, the
answer would be yes, because nuclear is more expensive than almost any
other source of electricity today]{.underline}. [[Renewables such as
solar, wind and hydroelectric]{.mark} power [generate electricity for
less than]{.mark} the nuclear [plants under
construction]{.mark}]{.underline} in Georgia, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark}
in most places, [they produc[e cheaper electricity than existing]{.mark}
nuclear [plants]{.mark} that have paid off all their construction
costs.]{.underline} In 2016, observing these trends, I launched a
company devoted to building offshore wind turbines. My journey, from
admiring [[nuclear]{.mark} power]{.underline} to fearing it, was
complete: This tech [[is **no longer**]{.mark} **a [viable]{.mark}
strategy [for dealing with climate change]{.mark}**, nor is it a
competitive source of power. [It is hazardous, expensive and
unreliable,]{.mark} and [abandoning it wouldn't bring on climate
doom]{.mark}. [The]{.mark} real [choice]{.mark} now [is between saving
the planet and saving the]{.mark} dying [nuclear industry]{.mark}. I
vote for the planet.]{.underline}

#### Warming causes Extinction

ecosystem collapse: Nature strikes back.\" Futures 102 (2018): 39-50.

In summary, six of the nine proposed planetary boundaries (phosphorous,
nitrogen, biodiversity, land use, atmospheric aerosol loading, and
chemical pollution) are unlikely to be associated with existential
risks. They all correspond to a degraded environment, but in our
assessment do not represent existential risks. [However, the three
remaining boundaries (**[climate]{.mark} [change]{.mark}**, global
[**freshwater**]{.mark} cycle, **[and]{.mark}** ocean
**[acidification]{.mark}**) do **[pose existential risks]{.mark}**.
[This is]{.mark} **[because of]{.mark}** intrinsic **[positive feedback
loops]{.mark}**, substantial lag times between system change and
experiencing the consequences of that change, and the fact these
different boundaries interact with one another in ways that yield
surprises. In addition, climate, freshwater, and ocean acidification are
all **[directly connected to]{.mark}** the provision of **[food and
water]{.mark}**, and **[shortages]{.mark}** of food and water can
**[create conflict]{.mark}** and social unrest.]{.underline} Climate
change has a long history of disrupting civilizations and sometimes
precipitating the collapse of cultures or mass emigrations (McMichael,
2017). For example, the 12th century drought in the North American
Southwest is held responsible for the collapse of the Anasazi pueblo
culture. More recently, the infamous potato famine of 1846--1849 and the
large migration of Irish to the U.S. can be traced to a combination of
factors, one of which was climate. Specifically, 1846 was an unusually
warm and moist year in Ireland, providing the climatic conditions
favorable to the fungus that caused the potato blight. As is so often
the case, poor government had a role as well---as the British government
forbade the import of grains from outside Britain (imports that could
have helped to redress the ravaged potato yields). [Climate change
intersects with freshwater resources because it is expected to
exacerbate drought and water scarcity, as well as flooding]{.underline}.
Climate change can even impair water quality because it is associated
with heavy rains that overwhelm sewage treatment facilities, or because
it results in higher concentrations of pollutants in groundwater as a
result of enhanced evaporation and reduced groundwater recharge.
[**[Ample clean water]{.mark}** is not a luxury---it **[is essential for
human survival]{.mark}**. Consequently, cities, regions and nations that
lack clean freshwater are vulnerable to social disruption and
disease]{.underline}. Finally, ocean acidification is linked to climate
change because it is driven by CO2 emissions just as global warming is.
With close to 20% of the world's protein coming from oceans (FAO, 2016),
the potential for severe impacts due to acidification is obvious. Less
obvious, but perhaps more insidious, is the interaction between climate
change and the loss of oyster and coral reefs due to acidification.
Acidification is known to interfere with oyster reef building and coral
reefs. Climate change also increases storm frequency and severity. Coral
reefs and oyster reefs provide protection from storm surge because they
reduce wave energy (Spalding et al., 2014). If these reefs are lost due
to acidification at the same time as storms become more severe and sea
level rises, coastal communities will be exposed to unprecedented storm
surge---and may be ravaged by recurrent storms. A key feature of the
risk associated with climate change is that mean annual temperature and
mean annual rainfall are not the variables of interest. Rather it is
extreme episodic events that place nations and entire regions of the
world at risk. These extreme events are by definition "rare" (once every
hundred years), and changes in their likelihood are challenging to
detect because of their rarity, but are exactly the manifestations of
climate change that we must get better at anticipating (Diffenbaugh et
al., 2017). Society will have a hard time responding to shorter
intervals between rare extreme events because in the lifespan of an
individual human, a person might experience as few as two or three
extreme events. How likely is it that you would notice a change in the
interval between events that are separated by decades, especially given
that the interval is not regular but varies stochastically? A concrete
example of this dilemma can be found in the past and expected future
changes in storm-related flooding of New York City. The highly
disruptive flooding of New York City associated with Hurricane Sandy
represented a flood height that occurred once every 500 years in the
18th century, and that occurs now once every 25 years, but is expected
to occur once every 5 years by 2050 (Garner et al., 2017). This change
in frequency of extreme floods has profound implications for the
measures New York City should take to protect its infrastructure and its
population, yet because of the stochastic nature of such events, this
shift in flood frequency is an elevated risk that will go unnoticed by
most people. 4. [The combination of positive feedback loops and societal
inertia is fertile ground for global environmental catastrophes
**[Humans]{.mark}** are remarkably ingenious, and **[have
adapted]{.mark}** to crises [**throughout**]{.mark} their
**[history]{.mark}**. Our doom has been repeatedly predicted, only to be
averted by innovation (Ridley, 2011). **[However]{.mark}**, the many
[**stories** **of**]{.mark} human ingenuity [**successfully**
**addressing** **existential risks**]{.mark} such as global famine or
extreme air pollution **[represent]{.mark}** environmental [c**hallenges
that are**]{.mark} largely [**linear**,]{.mark} have immediate
consequences, **[and operate without positive feedbacks]{.mark}**. For
example, the fact that food is in short supply does not increase the
rate at which humans consume food---thereby increasing the shortage.
Similarly, massive air pollution episodes such as the London fog of 1952
that killed 12,000 people did not make future air pollution events more
likely.]{.underline} In fact it was just the opposite---the London fog
sent such a clear message that Britain quickly enacted pollution control
measures (Stradling, 2016). Food shortages, air pollution, water
pollution, etc. send immediate signals to society of harm, which then
trigger a negative feedback of society seeking to reduce the harm. In
contrast, today's great environmental crisis of climate change may cause
some harm but there are generally long time delays between rising CO2
concentrations and damage to humans. The consequence of these delays are
an absence of urgency; thus although 70% of Americans believe global
warming is happening, only 40% think it will harm them
(http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/visualizations-data/ycom-us-2016[/).
Secondly, unlike past environmental challenges, **the Earth's climate
system is rife with positive feedback loops**. In particular, as CO2
increases and the climate warms, that **very warming can cause more CO2
release** which further increases global warming, and then more CO2, and
so on.]{.underline} Table 2 summarizes the best documented positive
feedback loops for the Earth's climate system. These feedbacks can be
neatly categorized into carbon cycle, biogeochemical, biogeophysical,
cloud, ice-albedo, and water vapor feedbacks. As important as it is to
understand these feedbacks individually, it is even more essential to
study the interactive nature of these feedbacks. Modeling studies show
that when interactions among feedback loops are included, uncertainty
increases dramatically and there is a heightened potential for
perturbations to be magnified (e.g., Cox, Betts, Jones, Spall, &
Totterdell, 2000; Hajima, Tachiiri, Ito, & Kawamiya, 2014; Knutti &
Rugenstein, 2015; Rosenfeld, Sherwood, Wood, & Donner, 2014). This
produces a wide range of future scenarios. Positive feedbacks in the
carbon cycle involves the enhancement of future carbon contributions to
the atmosphere due to some initial increase in atmospheric CO2. This
happens because as CO2 accumulates, it reduces the efficiency in which
oceans and terrestrial ecosystems sequester carbon, which in return
feeds back to exacerbate climate change (Friedlingstein et al., 2001).
Warming can also increase the rate at which organic matter decays and
carbon is released into the atmosphere, thereby causing more warming
(Melillo et al., 2017). Increases in food shortages and lack of water is
also of major concern when biogeophysical feedback mechanisms perpetuate
drought conditions. The underlying mechanism here is that losses in
vegetation increases the surface albedo, which suppresses rainfall, and
thus enhances future vegetation loss and more suppression of
rainfall---thereby initiating or prolonging a drought (Chamey, Stone, &
Quirk, 1975). To top it off, overgrazing depletes the soil, leading to
augmented vegetation loss (Anderies, Janssen, & Walker, 2002). Climate
change often also increases the risk of forest fires, as a result of
higher temperatures and persistent drought conditions. The expectation
is that **[[forest fires will become more]{.mark}
[frequent]{.mark}]{.underline}** and severe with climate warming and
drought (Scholze, Knorr, Arnell, & Prentice, 2006), a trend for which we
have already seen evidence (Allen et al., 2010). Tragically, the
increased severity and risk of Southern California wildfires recently
predicted by climate scientists (Jin et al., 2015), was realized in
December 2017, with the largest fire in the history of California (the
"Thomas fire" that burned 282,000 acres,
https://www.vox.com/2017/12/27/16822180/thomas-fire-california-largest-wildfire).
[This **[catastrophic fire]{.mark}** embodies the sorts of positive
feedbacks and interacting factors that [**could catch humanity off-guard
and produce a**]{.mark} true [**apocalyptic event.**]{.mark}
Record-breaking rains produced an extraordinary flush of new vegetation,
that then dried out as record heat waves and dry conditions took hold,
coupled with stronger than normal winds, and ignition.]{.underline} Of
course the record-fire released CO2 into the atmosphere, thereby
contributing to future warming. Out of all types of feedbacks, water
vapor and the ice-albedo feedbacks are the most clearly understood
mechanisms. Losses in reflective snow and ice cover drive up surface
temperatures, leading to even more melting of snow and ice cover---this
is known as the ice-albedo feedback (Curry, Schramm, & Ebert, 1995). As
snow and ice continue to melt at a more rapid pace, millions of people
may be displaced by flooding risks as a consequence of sea level rise
near coastal communities (Biermann & Boas, 2010; Myers, 2002; Nicholls
et al., 2011). The water vapor feedback operates when warmer atmospheric
conditions strengthen the saturation vapor pressure, which creates a
warming effect given water vapor's strong greenhouse gas properties
(Manabe & Wetherald, 1967). Global warming tends to increase cloud
formation because warmer temperatures lead to more evaporation of water
into the atmosphere, and warmer temperature also allows the atmosphere
to hold more water. The key question is whether this increase in clouds
associated with global warming will result in a positive feedback loop
(more warming) or a negative feedback loop (less warming). For decades,
scientists have sought to answer this question and understand the net
role clouds play in future climate projections (Schneider et al., 2017).
Clouds are complex because they both have a cooling (reflecting incoming
solar radiation) and warming (absorbing incoming solar radiation) effect
(Lashof, DeAngelo, Saleska, & Harte, 1997). The type of cloud, altitude,
and optical properties combine to determine how these countervailing
effects balance out. Although still under debate, it appears that in
most circumstances the cloud feedback is likely positive (Boucher et
al., 2013). For example, models and observations show that increasing
greenhouse gas concentrations reduces the low-level cloud fraction in
the Northeast Pacific at decadal time scales. This then has a positive
feedback effect and enhances climate warming since less solar radiation
is reflected by the atmosphere (Clement, Burgman, & Norris, 2009). [The
key lesson from the long list of potentially positive feedbacks and
their interactions is that **[runaway climate change,]{.mark}** and
runaway perturbations have to be taken as a serious
possibility]{.underline}. Table 2 is just a snapshot of the type of
feedbacks that have been identified (see Supplementary material for a
more thorough explanation of positive feedback loops). [However, this
list is not exhaustive and the possibility of undiscovered positive
feedbacks **[portends]{.mark}** even greater **[existential
risks]{.mark}**. The many environmental crises humankind has previously
averted (famine, ozone depletion, London fog, water pollution, etc.)
were averted because of political will based on solid scientific
understanding. We cannot count on complete scientific understanding when
it comes to positive feedback loops and climate change.]{.underline}

#### Nuclear Proliferation causes [Nuclear War]{.underline}.

[[The spread of nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s poses]{.mark} at least six
[**severe threats** to international]{.mark} peace and [security
including]{.mark}: **[nuc]{.mark}lear [war]{.mark}**, **nuclear
terrorism**, [global]{.mark} and]{.underline} [regional
[instability]{.mark}, constrained US freedom of action, **weakened
alliances**, and further nuclear proliferation.]{.underline} Each of
these threats has received extensive treatment elsewhere and this review
is not intended to replicate or even necessarily to improve upon these
previous efforts. Rather the goals of this section are more modest: to
usefully bring together and recap the many reasons why [we should be
pessimistic about the likely consequences of nuclear
proliferation]{.underline}. Many of these threats will be illuminated
with a discussion of a case of much contemporary concern: Iran's
advanced nuclear program. Nuclear War [The greatest threat]{.underline}
posed by the spread of nuclear weapons [is nuclear war. The **more
states** in possession of nuclear weapons]{.underline}, [the **greater
the probability** that somewhere, someday, there will be a
**catastrophic nuclear** war.]{.underline} To date, nuclear weapons have
only been used in warfare once. In 1945, the United States used nuclear
weapons on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, bringing World War II to a close.
Many analysts point to the 65-plus-year tradition of nuclear non-use as
evidence that nuclear weapons are unusable, but it would be naïve to
think that nuclear weapons will never be used again simply because they
have not been used for some time. After all, analysts in the 1990s
argued that worldwide economic downturns like the Great Depression were
a thing of the past, only to be surprised by the dot-com bubble bursting
later in the decade and the Great Recession of the late 2000s.48 This
author, for one, would be surprised if nuclear weapons are not used
again sometime in his lifetime. [[Before]{.mark} reaching a state of
**[MAD]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[new]{.mark} nuclear [states]{.mark} go
through a **transition** period in which they [**lack**]{.mark} a
[secure-**second strike** capability]{.mark}]{.underline}. In this
context, [one or both states might believe that [it has an **incentive**
to **use**]{.mark} nuclear weapons **[first]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For
example, if Iran acquires nuclear weapons, neither Iran, nor its
nuclear-armed rival, Israel, will have a secure, second-strike
capability. Even though it is believed to have a large arsenal, [given
its small size and lack of strategic depth, Israel might not be
confident that it could absorb a nuclear strike and respond with a
devastating counterstrike]{.underline}. Similarly, [Iran might
eventually be able to build a large and survivable nuclear arsenal, but,
when it first crosses the nuclear threshold, Tehran will have a small
and vulnerable nuclear force]{.underline}. In these pre-MAD situations,
there are at least three ways that nuclear war could occur. First, [the
state with the nuclear advantage might believe it has a]{.underline}
[splendid first strike capability. In a crisis, Israel
might]{.underline}, therefore, [decide to launch a **preventive nuclear
strike** to disarm Iran's nuclear capabilities.]{.underline} Indeed,
[this]{.underline} **[incentive]{.underline}** [might be further
increased by Israel's aggressive strategic culture that emphasizes
**preemptive action**.]{.underline} Second, [the state with a small and
vulnerable]{.underline} nuclear arsenal, in this case Iran, [might feel
**use them or lose them pressures**]{.underline}. That is, in a crisis,
Iran might decide to strike first rather than risk having its entire
nuclear arsenal destroyed. Third, as Thomas Schelling has argued,
nuclear war could result due to the reciprocal fear of surprise
attack.49 If there are advantages to striking first, one state might
start a nuclear war in the belief that war is inevitable and that it
would be better to go first than to go second. Fortunately, there is no
historic evidence of this dynamic occurring in a nuclear context, but it
is still possible. In an Israeli--Iranian crisis, for example, Israel
and Iran might both prefer to avoid a nuclear war, but decide to strike
first rather than suffer a devastating first attack from an opponent.
Even in a world of MAD, however, when both sides have secure,
second-strike capabilities, there is still a risk of nuclear war.
Rational deterrence theory assumes nuclear-armed states are governed by
rational leaders who would not intentionally launch a suicidal nuclear
war. This assumption appears to have applied to past and current nuclear
powers, but there is no guarantee that it will continue to hold in the
future. Iran's theocratic government, despite its inflammatory rhetoric,
has followed a fairly pragmatic foreign policy since 1979, but it
contains leaders who hold millenarian religious worldviews and could one
day ascend to power. We cannot rule out the possibility that, as nuclear
weapons continue to spread, some leader somewhere will choose to launch
a nuclear war, knowing full well that it could result in
self-destruction. One does not need to resort to irrationality, however,
to imagine nuclear war under MAD. Nuclear weapons may deter leaders from
intentionally launching full-scale wars, but they do not mean the end of
international politics. As was discussed above, nuclear-armed states
still have conflicts of interest and leaders still seek to coerce
nuclear-armed adversaries. Leaders might, therefore, choose to launch a
limited nuclear war.50 This strategy might be especially attractive to
states in a position of conventional inferiority that might have an
incentive to escalate a crisis quickly to the nuclear level. During the
Cold War, the United States planned to use nuclear weapons first to stop
a Soviet invasion of Western Europe given NATO's conventional
inferiority.51 As Russia's conventional power has deteriorated since the
end of the Cold War, Moscow has come to rely more heavily on nuclear
weapons in its military doctrine. Indeed, Russian strategy calls for the
use of nuclear weapons early in a conflict (something that most Western
strategists would consider to be escalatory) as a way to de-escalate a
crisis. Similarly, Pakistan's military plans for nuclear use in the
event of an invasion from conventionally stronger India. And finally,
Chinese generals openly talk about the possibility of nuclear use
against a US superpower in a possible East Asia contingency. Second, as
was also discussed above, [leaders can make a 'threat that leaves
something to chance'.]{.underline}52 **[They can initiate a nuclear
crisis]{.underline}**. [By playing these risky games of nuclear
brinkmanship, **states can increase the risk** of nuclear war in an
attempt **to force a less resolved adversary** to **back
down.**]{.underline} Historical [crises have not resulted in nuclear
war, but many of them]{.underline}, including the 1962 Cuban Missile
Crisis, [have **come close**]{.underline}. And scholars have documented
historical incidents when accidents nearly led to war.53 [When we think
about future nuclear crisis dyads]{.underline}, such as Iran and Israel,
[with fewer sources of stability than existed during the Cold War, we
can see that there is a real risk that **[a future crisis could result
in a]{.mark} devastating [nuclear exchange]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Nuclear Terrorism [The spread of nuclear weapons also **increases the
risk of nuclear terrorism**]{.underline}.54 While September 11th was one
of the greatest tragedies in American history, it would have been much
worse had Osama Bin Laden possessed nuclear weapons. Bin [Laden declared
it a 'religious duty' for Al- Qa'eda to acquire]{.underline} [nuclear
weapons and radical clerics have issued fatwas declaring it permissible
to use nuclear weapons in Jihad against the West]{.underline}.55 [Unlike
states, which can be more easily deterred, there is little doubt that if
terrorists acquired nuclear weapons, they would use them.56]{.underline}
Indeed, in recent years, many US politicians and security analysts have
argued that nuclear terrorism poses the greatest threat to US national
security.57 **[Analysts]{.underline}** [have pointed out]{.underline}
the tremendous **[hurdles]{.underline}** [that terrorists would have to
overcome]{.underline} [in order to acquire nuclear
weapons.58]{.underline} **[Nevertheless]{.underline}**, [**[as nuclear
weapons spread]{.mark}**, the [**possibility**]{.mark} that
[**they**]{.mark} will **eventually [fall into terrorist hands
increases]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [States could **[intentionally
transfer]{.mark} nuclear weapons**]{.underline}, [or]{.underline} the
fissile material required to build them, [to terrorist
groups]{.underline}. There are good reasons why a state might be
reluctant to transfer nuclear weapons to terrorists, but,
[as]{.underline} nuclear **[weapons spread]{.underline}**, [the
probability that a leader might someday **purposely arm a terrorist
group increases**]{.underline}. Some fear, for example, that Iran, with
its close ties to Hamas and Hizballah, might be at a heightened risk of
transferring nuclear weapons to terrorists. Moreover, even if no state
would ever intentionally transfer nuclear capabilities to terrorists, [a
**new nuclear state**, with **underdeveloped security** procedures,
might be vulnerable to **theft**, allowing terrorist groups or corrupt
or ideologically-motivated insiders to transfer dangerous material to
terrorists.]{.underline} There is evidence, for example, that
representatives from Pakistan's atomic energy establishment met with
Al-Qa'eda members to discuss a possible nuclear deal.59 Finally, [a
nuclear-armed state could collapse]{.underline}, [resulting in a
breakdown of law and order and a [**loose nukes**]{.mark}
problem]{.underline}. US officials are currently very concerned about
what would happen to Pakistan's nuclear weapons if the government were
to fall. As nuclear weapons spread, this problem is only further
amplified. Iran is a country with a history of revolutions and a
government with a tenuous hold on power. The regime change that
Washington has long dreamed about in Tehran could actually become a
nightmare if a nuclear-armed Iran suffered a breakdown in authority,
forcing us to worry about the fate of Iran's nuclear arsenal. Regional
Instability The spread of nuclear weapons also emboldens nuclear powers,
contributing to regional instability. States that lack nuclear weapons
need to fear direct military attack from other states, but states with
nuclear weapons can be confident that they can deter an intentional
military attack, giving them an incentive to be more aggressive in the
conduct of their foreign policy. In this way, nuclear weapons provide a
shield under which states can feel free to engage in lower-level
aggression. Indeed, international relations theories about the
'stability-instability paradox' maintain that stability at the nuclear
level contributes to conventional instability.60
**[[Historically]{.underline}]{.mark}**, we have seen that [the
**[spread]{.mark} [of nuclear weapons]{.mark}** []{.mark}has emboldened
their possessors and [contributed to **regional
instability**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Recent scholarly analyses have
demonstrated that, after controlling for other relevant factors,
nuclear-weapon states are more likely to engage in conflict than
nonnuclear]{.underline}-[weapon states]{.underline} and that [this
[aggressiveness is more **pronounced in new nuclear states**]{.mark}
that have less experience with nuclear diplomacy.]{.underline}61
Similarly, research on internal decision-making in Pakistan reveals that
Pakistani foreign policymakers may have been emboldened by the
acquisition of nuclear weapons, which encouraged them to initiate
militarized disputes against India.62 Currently, Iran restrains its
foreign policy because it fears major military retaliation from the
United States or Israel, but with nuclear weapons it could feel free to
push harder. A [nuclear-armed Iran would likely step up support to
terrorist and proxy groups and engage in more aggressive coercive
diplomacy]{.underline}. With a nuclear-armed Iran increasingly throwing
its weight around in the region, **[we could witness an even more crisis
prone Middle East.]{.underline}** [And in a poly-nuclear Middle
East]{.underline} with Israel, Iran, and, in the future, possibly other
states, armed with nuclear weapons, [**any** one of those [**crises**
could result in a **catastrophic nuclear
exchange**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

A proposed nuclear facility in Green River, UT would have consumed about
53,000 acre feet of water annually from the Green River (a valuable
tributary to the severely depleted Colorado River) to cool its reactors
and [[generate steam to power its
turbines]{.underline}](http://insideclimatenews.org/news/20120417/nuclear-power-plant-utah-blue-castle-green-river-colorado-river-water-war-sec-climate-change-drought).
That's enough water to supply 200,000 people a year, roughly the size of
Tacoma, WA. When thinking about the [**scarcity of available
freshwater** in the world and the increased drought-like
conditions]{.underline} in many parts of the country, those [numbers add
up to major impacts not just to our economy, but our
survival]{.underline}. Just look at the [increasing amount of
**tension** and **war-like conditions** currently developing between
local communities and their government over water supply in politically
unstable areas such as the Middle East.]{.underline}

The Southwest [Nuclear Project Electric Generating Station]{.underline}
([SNPEGS]{.underline}) near Bay City, TX is right along the Colorado
River and uses water from the river to power each unit and cool the
reactors. Two proposed additional units in 2010 were turned down due
to [[financial
constraints]{.underline}](http://www.dallasnews.com/business/energy/20110419-nrg-ends-project-to-build-new-nuclear-reactors.ece).
The proposed project would [have piped tens of thousands acre-feet of
water each year from the Colorado River]{.underline}, [[decreasing the
amount of fresh water remaining in the
river](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=www.nukefree.org%20south%20texas%20nuclear%20plant).]{.underline} Given
that a number of other interests had previously gained access to the
Colorado River and aggressively used up the water, the [ecological
effect would have been devastating]{.underline}. Though SNPEGS does not
directly discharge wastewater into the Colorado River, [wastewater
discharge and the effect on water quality remains an **issue in many
other regions** throughout the US]{.underline}, and is especially
problematic in fragile, drought-prone areas. The [combination of
**drought-depleted rivers** and the negative effect on water
quality]{.underline} makes the [outlook on **future water security
extremely bleak**.]{.underline}

In 2006, the Department of Energy warned that [consumption of water for
electricity production could more than double by 2030 to 7.3 billion
gallons per day in the US if developers continue to build new power
plants]{.underline} with evaporative cooling, an amount [[equal to the
entire country's water consumption for
1995](http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1040&context=wmelpr).]{.underline}
The three stages of nuclear fuel cycle---[**uranium milling** and
**mining**, **plant operation**, and nuclear **waste storage**---all
consume, withdraw, and contaminate water supplies.]{.underline} Due to
this large need for water resources, most [nuclear facilities cannot
even operate during drought conditions]{.underline}, and in some [cases
can actually **cause water shortages**.]{.underline}

The reality around nuclear energy and water should cause both consumers
and producers to take [caution around expanding nuclear energy or
relying on it as a "clean" form of energy]{.underline} in drought-prone
regions like the American Southwest, California, and Texas, especially
when [rivers are at high risk of being **drained** of their remaining
water]{.underline}. The [impact of climate change will only worsen
drought and stress on water resources and create more tension throughout
the world.]{.underline} Thus, if the other environmental costs of
nuclear don't dissuade people enough from using it as a "clean energy
alternative," the [cumulative effect on water security]{.underline}
should tip the scales against expanding this form of energy in the U.S.

But [a]{.underline}nother [looming issue confronting global leaders

**[p]{.underline}**roduct [decline by up to 6 percent]{.underline} by
2050 [due to water-related losses]{.underline} in agriculture, health,
income and property. The areas highlighted consist of many of the
world's largest population concentrations, regions with developing
economies, intensive and unsustainable agricultural practices and high
occurrences of drought. [**[Dam-building]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} its
**downstream [effects]{.mark}** [across **national
borders**]{.mark}]{.underline}---[as in the case of]{.underline}
Ethiopia's Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam and [China's water diversion

[or]{.underline} [**[redefine national claims]{.underline}**
[over]{.underline} **[disputed regions.]{.underline}**]{.mark} [Such
disputes could **mushroom across the globe**]{.underline} [in the face
of broader demographic and resource shifts.]{.underline} According to
the Pacific Institute's water conflict chronology database, [eighteen
water-related incidents occurred in 2018 alone]{.underline}, ranging
from violence erupting at protests over water management to outright
fighting between competing communities over access to water and herding
rights. [These incidents appear destined to become more]{.underline}
[a]{.underline} **[norm]{.underline}** [than an outlier as water
resources are consumed faster than rainfall replenishment in some areas
and limitations **[exacerbate]{.mark} longstanding
[tensions]{.mark},**]{.underline} [be they **ethnic**]{.underline},
**[tribal]{.underline}** [or]{.underline}
**[national-based]{.underline}**. [Delicate tradeoff systems between
nations located upstream and downstream of major rivers threaten to be
**undone by disruptions**]{.underline}, as in the case of Central Asian
countries sharing parts of the Fergana Valley. In addition, [scarcity
issues may create **[internal security pressures]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[by leading to **radicalization**]{.mark} amongst vulnerable population
sectors.]{.underline} With water a vital and finite resource, the
world's industrialized nations are naturally protective of local supply
and place a premium on water security in instances where water flows
across shared borders. [When mixed with **political disputes** or
**rivalries**, [resource pressures may act as a **catalyst for armed
conflict**.]{.mark} Wars over water resources **are not without
precedent**]{.underline}. [The Six-Day War]{.underline} of 1967, for
instance, [was in part an Israeli military response to a Syrian attempt
to dam the Yarmuk Rive]{.underline}r, a tributary of the Jordan River,
[a crucial water source for Israel. Another potential
[flashpoint]{.mark} [exists]{.mark} [in]{.mark} one of the world's most
tense arenas: **the border between [India and
Pakistan]{.mark}**.]{.underline} [There the potential repudiation of a
water-sharing agreement]{.underline} brokered by the World Bank in 1960,
[the Indus Waters Treaty]{.underline}, [would serve to **further [damage
relations]{.mark}**]{.underline} [between Pakistan and India,
potentially]{.underline} [sending the two rivals **[spiraling
into]{.mark} a [conflict]{.mark}** [that might]{.mark} **[draw in other
nations]{.mark}.**]{.underline} The treaty remains in place despite two
wars conducted over that time between the neighboring rivals. This is a
credit to the cornerstone of the agreement: the rational self-interest
of both signatories. With water at a premium for both, any war over it
would threaten the supply of each actor, thus ostensibly negating the
pretense for armed conflict. But [with Pakistan facing declining water
availability and blaming its situation on India\'s "water terrorism,"
the potential for crisis increases]{.underline}. India, which plans for
a presumptive "collusive threat" on both its northeast and northwest
borders from China and Pakistan, must tread carefully in order to avoid
reciprocity from Beijing should the latter turn its back on water
rationality. While India holds an upstream riparian advantage over
Pakistan in regards to the Sutlej, Beas and Ravi Rivers, so too does
China as it relates to major rivers flowing into India from Tibet.
[Considering Pakistan's water vulnerability]{.underline}---which
involves exploding population growth, poor water utilization and
infrastructure maintenance, and unsustainable usage patterns---[**[any
threat by India]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} **abrogate the treaty** or
**[maximize its use of water]{.mark}**]{.underline} [from any of the
rivers covered under the IWT [would be seen]{.mark} by Islamabad
[as]{.mark} **tantamount to [an act of war]{.mark}.** Factor in
Pakistan's **strategic alignment with China**]{.underline} [and
[any]{.mark} outbreak of [conflict might **draw Beijing in**]{.mark}**to
the scrum**]{.underline}, [thereby resulting in India confronting the
two-front war its planners most fear]{.underline}. [Under this scenario,
in which **[three nuclear-armed nations]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[]{.mark}[conduct]{.underline} **[military operations]{.underline}** [at
some level of intensity, the rest of the world would be left
**scrambling to mediate the crisis at zero hour.**]{.underline}

[**France** [recently
announced](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/10/france-to-build-up-to-14-new-nuclear-reactors-by-2050-says-macron) it
would build up to **14 new nuclear reactors** by 2050]{.underline}. This
marked a policy reversal, as President Emmanuel Macron had promised four
years ago to move away from nuclear power and close 12 nuclear reactors.
But the [country got a reality check this winter when some of its
nuclear power plants went offline, and it was forced to turn to coal as
a result.]{.underline}

France [will construct six new nuclear reactors, and study the
possibility of an additional eight]{.underline}. \"Given the electricity
needs, the need to also anticipate the transition and the end of the
existing fleet, which cannot be extended indefinitely, we are going to
launch today a program of new nuclear reactors,\" Macron said.

But the [vast majority of new nuclear power construction over the next
five years will take place in the **Asia Pacific** region. This is
important, because this is the area of the fastest growth in carbon
dioxide emissions.]{.underline}

[**China**, already a major nuclear power, has nearly [**20 new nuclear
reactors**](https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/current-and-future-generation/plans-for-new-reactors-worldwide.aspx)]{.underline} that
will be under construction within the next five years. [**India**, which
is one of the world's largest and fastest-growing energy consumers,
isn't yet a major nuclear power producer. However, with **eight new
nuclear reactors** that will commence construction by 2027, it is making
a firm commitment toward becoming one.]{.underline}

More nuclear power in China and India could help supply growing energy
demands without a continued explosion in the region's carbon dioxide
emissions. In fact, it may be the only solution that can reasonably
achieve this objective.

In the U.S. --- the world's largest nuclear power producer --- nuclear
power generation has been flat for the past two decades. But that should
change this year with the commissioning of Southern's Vogtle Units 3 and
4. These will be [the **first new nuclear units built in the United
States** in more than three decades.]{.underline}

There are admittedly [still a lot of headwinds for the industry in the
wake of previous nuclear disasters like Chernobyl in 1986 and the 2011
Fukushima nuclear disaster]{.underline}. [**Another major disaster** has
to be avoided, because it would be a **huge setback** for this critical
tool for producing firm, scalable power with a low carbon
footprint.]{.underline}

But, with the current slate of nuclear plants under construction, there
is at least [some hope that nuclear is regaining
acceptance]{.underline}, and can make a growing contribution toward
arresting the growth of global carbon emissions.

for error will be razor thin**.]{.underline} When a coal mine collapses
or a natural gas pipeline leaks, the public ignores it or quickly moves
on. [But if anything goes wrong with a nuclear reactor, no matter how
minimal the damage, nuclear fear will reignite, with severe consequences
for the industry.]{.underline}

[Following efforts to strengthen nuclear safety and with global warming
becoming ever more apparent]{.underline}, [**nuclear power is regaining
a place in global debates** as a climate-friendly energy
option]{.underline}. That is due to its vital attributes: zero emissions
during operation, 24/7 availability, a small land footprint and the
versatility to decarbonize [['hard-to-abate'
sectors]{.underline}](https://www.iaea.org/fr/newscenter/news/iaea-data-animation-the-game-changing-power-of-nuclear-energy-to-reduce-greenhouse-gas-emissions) in
industry and transportation. But even as technology-neutral
organizations such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC) and the International Energy Agency (IEA) recognize nuclear
power's ability to address major global challenges, [the extent to which
this clean, reliable and sustainable source of energy will achieve its
**full potential remains uncertain.**]{.underline}

The [Fukushima Daiichi accident and public acceptance in some countries
continue to cast a shadow over nuclear power's prospects]{.underline}.
Furthermore, in some major markets, nuclear power lacks a favourable
policy
and [[financing]{.underline}](https://www.iaea.org/sites/default/files/18/07/financing-np-0418.pdf) framework
that recognize its contributions to climate change mitigation and
sustainable development. Without such a framework, nuclear power will
struggle to deliver on its full potential, even as the world remains as
dependent on fossil fuels as it was three decades ago.

[Impact on electricity generation]{.underline}

The [biggest immediate blow to nuclear electricity generation came in
Japan.]{.underline} With [public confidence in nuclear power at record
low levels following the accident,]{.underline} authorities suspended
operations at 46 of the country's 50 operational power reactors. Nuclear
energy, a strategic priority since the 1960s, supplying almost a third
of Japan's electricity, was suddenly shelved. In 2019, nuclear power
provided only 7.5% of Japan's electricity. Just nine nuclear power
reactors have resumed operation.

Meanwhile, [public and government **opinion turned against nuclear power
in some other countries as well**]{.underline}. [Germany]{.underline},
less than three months after the accident, [decided to phase out nuclear
power entirely by 2022]{.underline}. All but six of the country's 17
power reactors have since been permanently shut down. Nuclear power
produced about 12% of the country's electricity in 2019 compared with
around 25% before the accident at Fukushima Daiichi, while coal-fired
plants remained the largest source of electricity, according to the IEA.
Elsewhere, [Belgium confirmed plans to exit nuclear power by
2025.]{.underline} In [Italy, a government-backed plan to bring back
nuclear power]{.underline}, [shuttered since 1990]{.underline}, fizzled.
And countries such as Spain and Switzerland decided not to build new
nuclear plants. Between 2011 and 2020, [some 48 GWe of nuclear capacity
was lost globally as a total of 65 reactors were either shut down or did
not have their operational lifetimes extended.]{.underline}

[The **immediate effect was a decline in global nuclear electricity
generation** through 2012]{.underline}. At the same time, [efforts to
deploy other low carbon sources, such as **variable wind and solar,
intensified** as countries looked for new ways to address the climate
crisis]{.underline}. Still, nuclear energy remained the world's second
largest source of low carbon electricity after hydro, providing at the
time about 40% of all low carbon power.

So, [in the history of nuclear power in the Western world, covering a
combined 19,000 years of operation experience from some 442 reactors in
about 28 countries plus about 200 reactors that have been shut down
temporarily or permanently, we have had two "incidents" that caused zero
deaths and almost no measurable personal or environmental injury from
radiation.]{.underline} The only real [catastrophe that was "caused" by
nuclear power took place in blatant disregard of safety protocols and a
reactor prone to instability]{.underline} and illegal to be built
anywhere today and ever in the West. Stunningly, more people would have
died from the additional fossil fuel pollution had the Chernobyl plant,
with a total generation of [[271,261
GWh]{.underline}](https://de.nucleopedia.org/wiki/Kernkraftwerk_Tschernobyl),
never been built: At [[28.67 deaths per TWh of electricity from the
alternative, coal]{.underline}](https://doi.org/10.1021/es3051197), the
total number of lives saved is 7,777. This is in about seven decades of
nuclear power generation. Our three exceptions notwithstanding, nuclear
energy has produced an immense amount of energy for us in a sustainable
and efficient manner, with virtually no health risks to humans and to
the environment. So, why is nuclear energy still classified by many as
"dangerous"?

We will now turn to where nuclear waste goes and why people incorrectly
perceive it as dangerous.

Let's start with this. Throughout the history of nuclear power, [waste
has been stored at the site of the plant in a [deep pool of water or in
"dry
casks."](https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/nuclear-waste/storage-and-disposal-of-radioactive-waste.aspx)]{.underline} This
is true for hundreds of nuclear reactors across the globe. In that time,
[there have been no deaths, no injuries, and no disruptions of society
caused by radiation leakage of any kind.]{.underline}

Nuclear skeptics have observed that this is not a "permanent" solution
because the waste remains radioactive for many years. This is true. It
is also true that:

The [radioactivity of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) drops continuously,
making it, like all nuclear waste, [less dangerous over
time](https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/nuclear-wastes/radioactive-wastes-myths-and-realities.aspx).]{.underline}
Coming fresh out of a reactor, SNF is rich in fission products with a
very short half-life. This means that [much of the radioactivity happens
in the first weeks, hours, or even seconds after a reactor has been shut
off.]{.underline} [Radioactive isotopes of Xenon and Iodine, for
example, decay first]{.underline}, and give off quite a bit of radiation
and heat. [Cesium and Strontium isotopes dominate as radiation sources
in the next phase, but after 300 years they are pretty much gone,
too.]{.underline} (Note: each atom of a radioactive, or unstable,
isotope can be "radioactive" only once, during its decay.) SNF contains
other radioactive elements with half-lives of thousands of years, such
as Plutonium and even heavier elements. But, [due to their relative
stability, they are also not very dangerous.]{.underline} Toxic, as
heavy metals, yes, but not very radioactive. (Rule of thumb: Highly
radioactive = gone quickly, and low radioactivity = sticking around for
much longer.)

The [radiation itself is easily stopped by shielding]{.underline},
though some gamma rays make it past any shielding. However, [their
destructive energy, already quite harmless on the outside of spent
nuclear fuel containers, drops by the inverse square of the distance
until finally absorbed by matter]{.underline}. What that means is that
the ["danger zone" around spent nuclear fuel is very small, measured in
feet or yards, not miles.]{.underline}

[To achieve **optimum safety**, [nuclear plants in the western world
operate using a \'defence-in-depth\' approach, with **multiple safety
systems**]{.mark} supplementing the natural features of the reactor
core]{.underline}. Key aspects of the approach are: high-quality design
& construction, equipment which prevents operational disturbances or
human failures and errors developing into problems, comprehensive
monitoring and regular testing to detect equipment or operator failures,
redundant and diverse systems to control damage to the fuel and prevent
significant radioactive releases, provision to confine the effects of
severe fuel damage (or any other problem) to the plant itself. These can
be summed up as: Prevention, Monitoring, and Action (to mitigate
consequences of failures).The safety provisions include a series of
physical barriers between the radioactive reactor core and the
environment, the provision of multiple safety systems, each with backup
and designed to accommodate human error. Safety systems account for
about one quarter of the capital cost of such reactors. As well as the
physical aspects of safety, there are institutional aspects which are no
less important - see following section on International
Collaboration.The barriers in a typical plant are: the fuel is in the
form of solid ceramic (UO2) pellets, and radioactive fission products
remain largely bound inside these pellets as the fuel is burned. The
pellets are packed inside sealed zirconium alloy tubes to form fuel
rods. These are confined inside a large steel pressure vessel with walls
up to 30 cm thick -- the associated primary water cooling pipework is
also substantial. All this, in turn, is enclosed inside a robust
reinforced concrete containment structure with walls at least one metre
thick. This amounts to three significant barriers around the fuel, which
itself is stable up to very high temperatures.These barriers are
monitored continually. The fuel cladding is monitored by measuring the
amount of radioactivity in the cooling water. The high pressure cooling
system is monitored by the leak rate of water, and the containment
structure by periodically measuring the leak rate of air at about five
times atmospheric pressure.Looked at functionally, the three basic
safety functions in a nuclear reactor are: to control reactivity, to
cool the fuel and to contain radioactive substances. The main safety
features of most reactors are inherent - negative temperature
coefficient and negative void coefficient. The first means that beyond
an optimal level, as the temperature increases the efficiency of the
reaction decreases (this in fact is used to control power levels in some
new designs). The second means that if any steam has formed in the
cooling water there is a decrease in moderating effect so that fewer
neutrons are able to cause fission and the reaction slows down
automatically. In the 1950s and 1960s some experimental reactors in
Idaho were deliberately tested to destruction to verify that large
reactivity excursions were self-limiting and would automatically shut
down the fission reaction. These tests verified that this was the case.
Beyond the control rods which are inserted to absorb neutrons and
regulate the fission process, the main engineered safety provisions are
the back-up emergency core cooling system (ECCS) to remove excess heat
(though it is more to prevent damage to the plant than for public
safety) and the containment. Traditional reactor safety systems are
\'active\' in the sense that they involve electrical or mechanical
operation on command. Some engineered systems operate passively, eg
pressure relief valves. Both require parallel redundant systems.
Inherent or full passive safety design depends only on physical
phenomena such as convection, gravity or resistance to high
temperatures, not on functioning of engineered components. [All
[reactors have some elements of inherent safety as mentioned
above]{.mark}, but in [some recent designs the passive or inherent
features substitute for active systems in cooling]{.mark}
etc]{.underline}. [Such a design would have **averted** the
Fukushima]{.underline} accident, where loss of electrical power resulted
is loss of cooling function. The basis of design assumes a threat where
due to accident or malign intent (eg terrorism) there is core melting
and a breach of containment. This double possibility has been well
studied and provides the basis of exclusion zones and contingency plans.
Apparently during the Cold War neither Russia nor the USA targeted the
other\'s nuclear power plants because the likely damage would be modest.
Nuclear power plants are designed with sensors to shut them down
automatically in an earthquake, and this is a vital consideration in
many parts of the world. (See Nuclear Power Plants and Earthquakes
paper) Severe accident management In both the Three Mile Island (TMI)
and Fukushima accidents the problems started after the reactors were
shut down -- immediately at TMI and after an hour at Fukushima, when the
tsunami arrived. The need to remove decay heat from the fuel was not met
in each case, so core melting started to occur within a few hours.
Cooling requires water circulation and an external heat sink. If pumps
cannot run due to lack of power, gravity must be relied upon, but this
will not get water into a pressurised system -- either reactor pressure
vessel or containment. Hence there is provision for relieving pressure,
sometimes with a vent system, but this must work and be controlled
without power. There is a question of filters or scrubbers in the vent
system: these need to be such that they do not block due to solids being
carried. Ideally any vent system should deal with any large amounts of
hydrogen, as at Fukushima, and have minimum potential to spread
radioactivity outside the plant. Filtered containment ventilation
systems (FCVSs) are being retrofitted to some reactors which did not
already have them, or any of sufficient capacity, following the
Fukushima accident. The basic premise of a FCVS is that, independent of
the state of the reactor itself, the catastrophic failure of the
containment structure can be avoided by discharging steam, air and
incondensable gases like hydrogen to the atmosphere. The Three Mile
Island accident in 1979 demonstrated the importance of the inherent
safety features. Despite the fact that about half of the reactor core
melted, radionuclides released from the melted fuel mostly plated out on
the inside of the plant or dissolved in condensing steam. The
containment building which housed the reactor further prevented any
significant release of radioactivity. The accident was attributed to
mechanical failure and operator confusion. The reactor\'s other
protection systems also functioned as designed. The emergency core
cooling system would have prevented any damage to the reactor but for
the intervention of the operators. Investigations following the accident
led to a new focus on the human factors in nuclear safety. No major
design changes were called for in western reactors, but controls and
instrumentation were improved significantly and operator training was
overhauled. At Fukushima Daiichi in March 2011 the three operating
reactors shut down automatically, and were being cooled as designed by
the normal residual heat removal system using power from the back-up
generators, until the tsunami swamped them an hour later. The emergency
core cooling systems then failed. Days later, a separate problem emerged
as spent fuel ponds lost water. Analysis of the accident showed the need
for more intelligent siting criteria than those used in the 1960s, and
the need for better back-up power and post-shutdown cooling, as well as
provision for venting the containment of that kind of reactor and other
emergency management procedures. Nuclear plants have Severe Accident
Mitigation Guidelines (SAMG, or in Japan: SAG), and most of these,
including all those in the USA, address what should be done for
accidents beyond design basis, and where several systems may be
disabled. See section below. In 2007 the US NRC launched a research
program to assess the possible consequences of a serious reactor
accident. Its draft report was released nearly a year after the
Fukushima accident had partly confirmed its findings. [The
State-of-the-Art Reactor Consequences Analysis (SOARCA) showed [that a
**severe accident** at a US nuclear power plant]{.mark} (PWR or BWR)
would [not be likely to cause **any immediate deaths**]{.mark}, and [the
risks of fatal cancers would be vastly less than the general risks of
cancer]{.mark}.]{.underline} SOARCA\'s main conclusions fall into three
areas: how a reactor accident progresses; how existing systems and
emergency measures can affect an accident\'s outcome; and how an
accident would affect the public\'s health. The principal conclusion is
that existing resources and procedures can stop an accident, slow it
down or reduce its impact before it can affect the public, but even if
accidents proceed without such mitigation they take much longer to
happen and release much less radioactive material than earlier analyses
suggested. This was borne out at Fukushima, where there was ample time
for evacuation -- three days -- before any significant radioactive
releases. In 2015 the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) released
its Study of Consequences of a Hypothetical Severe Nuclear Accident and
Effectiveness of Mitigation Measures. This was the result of research
and analysis undertaken to address concerns raised during public
hearings in 2012 on the environmental assessment for the refurbishment
of Ontario Power Generation\'s (OPG\'s) Darlington nuclear power plant.
The study involved identifying and modelling a large atmospheric release
of radionuclides from a hypothetical severe nuclear accident at the
four-unit Darlington power plant; estimating the doses to individuals at
various distances from the plant, after factoring in protective actions
such as evacuation that would be undertaken in response to such an
emergency; and, finally, determining human health and environmental
consequences due to the resulting radiation exposure. It concluded that
there would be no detectable health effects or increase in cancer risk.
A fuller write-up of it is on the World Nuclear News website. A
different safety philosophy: Early Soviet-designed reactors The April
1986 disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in Ukraine was the
result of major design deficiencies in the RBMK type of reactor, the
violation of operating procedures and the absence of a safety culture.
One peculiar feature of the RBMK design was that coolant failure could
lead to a strong increase in power output from the fission process (
positive void coefficient). However, this was not the prime cause of the
Chernobyl accident. It once and for all vindicated the desirability of
designing with inherent safety supplemented by robust secondary safety
provisions. By way of contrast to western safety engineering, the
Chernobyl reactor did not have a containment structure like those used
in the West or in post-1980 Soviet designs. The accident destroyed the
reactor, and its burning contents dispersed radionuclides far and wide.
This tragically meant that the results were severe, with 56 people
killed, 28 of whom died within weeks from radiation exposure. It also
caused radiation sickness in a further 200-300 staff and firefighters,
and contaminated large areas of Belarus, Ukraine, Russia and beyond. It
is estimated that at least 5% of the total radioactive material in the
Chernobyl-4 reactor core was released from the plant, due to the lack of
any containment structure. Most of this was deposited as dust close by.
Some was carried by wind over a wide area. However, the problem here was
not burning graphite as popularly quoted. The graphite was certainly
incandescent as a result of fuel decay heat - sometimes over 1000°C -
and some of it oxidised to carbon monoxide which burned along with the
fuel cladding. About 130,000 people received significant radiation doses
(i.e. above internationally accepted ICRP limits) and continue to be
monitored. About 4000 cases of thyroid cancer in children have been
linked to the accident. Most of these were curable, though about nine
were fatal. No increase in leukaemia or other cancers have yet shown up,
but some is expected. The World Health Organisation is closely
monitoring most of those affected. The Chernobyl accident was a unique
event and the only time in the history of commercial nuclear power that
radiation-related fatalities occurred. The main positive outcome of this
accident for the industry was the formation of the World Association of
Nuclear Operators (WANO), building on the US precedent. The destroyed
unit 4 was enclosed in a concrete shelter which is being replaced by a
more permanent structure. An OECD expert report on it concluded that
\"the Chernobyl accident has not brought to light any new, previously
unknown phenomena or safety issues that are not resolved or otherwise
covered by current reactor safety programs for commercial power reactors
in OECD Member countries. In other words, the concept of \'defence in
depth\' was conspicuous by its absence, and tragically shown to be
vitally important. Apart from the RBMK reactor design, an early Russian
PWR design, the VVER-440/V-230, gave rise to concerns in Europe, and a
program was initiated to close these down as a condition of EU
accession, along with Lithuania's two RBMK units. See related papers on
Early Soviet Reactors and EU Accession, and RBMK Reactors. However,
after the US Atomic Energy Commission published General Design Criteria
for Nuclear Power Plants in 1971, Russian PWR designs conformed,
according to Rosatom. In particular, the VVER-440/V-213 Loviisa reactors
in Finland were designed at that time and modified to conform. The first
of these two came on line in 1977. A broader picture -- other past
accidents [There have been [a number of accidents in experimental
reactors and in one military plutonium-producing reactor]{.mark},
including a number of core melts, but **[none]{.mark}** of these [has
resulted in loss of life]{.mark} outside the actual plant, [or long-term
environmental contamination]{.mark}]{.underline}. Elsewhere (Safety of
Nuclear Power info paper appendix) we tabulate these, along with the
most serious commercial plant accidents. The list of ten probably
corresponds to incidents rating 4 or higher on today's International
Nuclear Event Scale (Table 4). All except Browns Ferry and Vandellos
involved damage to or malfunction of the reactor core. At Browns Ferry a
fire damaged control cables and resulted in an 18-month shutdown for
repairs; at Vandellos a turbine fire made the 17-year old plant
uneconomic to repair. Mention should be made of the accident to the US
Fermi-1 prototype fast breeder reactor near Detroit in 1966. Due to a
blockage in coolant flow, some of the fuel melted. However no radiation
was released off-site and no-one was injured. The reactor was repaired
and restarted but closed down in 1972. The well-publicized criticality
accident at Tokai Mura, Japan, in 1999 was at a fuel preparation plant
for experimental reactors, and killed two workers from radiation
exposure. Many other such criticality accidents have occurred, some
fatal, and practically all in military facilities prior to 1980. A
review of these is listed in the References. In an uncontained reactor
accident such as at Windscale (a military facility) in 1957 and at
Chernobyl in 1986, (and to some extent: Fukushima in 2011,) the
principal health hazard is from the spread of radioactive materials,
notably volatile fission products such as iodine-131 and caesium-137.
These are biologically active, so that if consumed in food, they tend to
stay in organs of the body. I-131 has a half-life of 8 days, so is a
hazard for around the first month, (and apparently gave rise to the
thyroid cancers after the Chernobyl accident). Caesium-137 has a
half-life of 30 years, and is therefore potentially a long-term
contaminant of pastures and crops. In addition to these, there is
caesium-134 which has a half-life of about two years. While measures can
be taken to limit human uptake of I-131, (evacuation of area for several
weeks, iodide tablets), high levels of radioactive caesium can preclude
food production from affected land for a long time. Other radioactive
materials in a reactor core have been shown to be less of a problem
because they are either not volatile (strontium, transuranic elements)
or not biologically active (tellurium-132, xenon-133). Accidents in any
field of technology provide valuable knowledge enabling incremental
improvement in safety beyond the original engineering. Cars and
airliners are the most obvious examples of this, but the chemical and
oil industries can provide even stronger evidence. Civil nuclear power
has greatly improved its safety in both engineering and operation over
its 55 years of experience with very few accidents and major incidents
to spur that improvement. The Fukushima Daiichi accident is the first
since Three Mile Island in 1979 which will have significant
implications, at least for older plants. Scrams, Seismic shutdowns A
scram is a sudden reactor shutdown. When a reactor is scrammed,
automatically due to seismic activity, or due to some malfunction, or
manually for whatever reason, the fission reaction generating the main
heat stops. However, considerable heat continues to be generated by the
radioactive decay of the fission products in the fuel. Initially, for a
few minutes, this is great - about 7% of the pre-scram level. But it
drops to about 1% of the normal heat output after two hours, to 0.5%
after one day, and 0.2% after a week. Even then it must still be cooled,
but simply being immersed in a lot of water does most of the job after
some time. When the water temperature is below 100°C at atmospheric
pressure the reactor is said to be in \"cold shutdown\". European
\"stress tests\" and US response following Fukushima accident Aspects of
nuclear plant safety highlighted by the Fukushima accident were assessed
in the 143 nuclear reactors in the EU\'s 27 member states, as well as
those in any neighbouring states that decided to take part. These
comprehensive and transparent nuclear risk and safety assessments, the
so-called \"stress tests\", involved targeted reassessment of each power
reactor's safety margins in the light of extreme natural events, such as
earthquakes and flooding, as well as on loss of safety functions and
severe accident management following any initiating event. They were
conducted from June 2011 to April 2012. They mobilized considerable
expertise in different countries (500 man-years) under the
responsibility of each national Safety Authority within the framework of
the European Nuclear Safety Regulators Group (ENSREG). The Western
European Nuclear Regulators\' Association (WENRA) proposed these in
response to a call from the European Council in March 2011, and
developed specifications. WENRA is a network of Chief Regulators of EU
countries with nuclear power plants and Switzerland, and has membership
from 17 countries. It then negotiated the scope of the tests with the
European Nuclear Safety Regulators Group (ENSREG), an independent,
authoritative expert body created in 2007 by the European Commission
comprising senior officials from the national nuclear safety,
radioactive waste safety or radiation protection regulatory authorities
from all 27 EU member states, and representatives of the European
Commission. In June 2011 the governments of seven non-EU countries
agreed to conduct nuclear reactor stress tests using the EU model.
Armenia, Belarus, Croatia, Russia, Switzerland, Turkey and Ukraine
signed a declaration that they would conduct stress tests and agreed to
peer reviews of the tests by outside experts. Russia had already
undertaken extensive checks. (Croatia is co-owner in the Krsko PWR in
Slovenia, and Belarus and Turkey plan to build nuclear plants but have
none now.) The reassessment of safety margins is based on the existing
safety studies and engineering judgment to evaluate the behaviour of a
nuclear power plant when facing a set of challenging situations. For a
given plant, the reassessment reports on the most probable behaviour of
the plant for each of the situations considered. The results of the
reassessment were peer-reviewed and shared among regulators. WENRA noted
that it remains a national responsibility to take or order any
appropriate measures, such as additional technical or organisational
safety provisions, resulting from the reassessment.    The scope of the
assessment took into account the issues directly highlighted by the
events in Fukushima and the possibility for combination of initiating
events. Two \'initiating events\' were covered in the scope: earthquake
and flooding. The consequences of these -- loss of electrical power and
station blackout, loss of ultimate heat sink and the combination of both
-- were analysed, with the conclusions being applicable to other general
emergency situations. In accident scenarios, regulators consider power
plants\' means to protect against and manage loss of core cooling as
well as cooling of used fuel in storage. They also study means to
protect against and manage loss of containment integrity and core
melting, including consequential effects such as hydrogen accumulation.
Nuclear plant operators start by documenting each power plant site. This
analysis of \'extreme scenarios\' followed what ENSREG called a
progressive approach \"in which protective measures are sequentially
assumed to be defeated\" from starting conditions which \"represent the
most unfavourable operational states.\" The operators have to explain
their means to maintain \"the three fundamental safety functions
(control of reactivity, fuel cooling confinement of radioactivity)\" and
support functions for these, \"taking into account the probable damage
done by the initiating event.\" The documents had to cover provisions in
the plant design basis for these events and the strength of the plant
beyond its design basis. This means the \"design margins, diversity,
redundancy, structural protection and physical separation of the safety
relevant systems, structures and components and the effectiveness of the
defence-in-depth concept.\" This had to focus on \'cliff-edge\' effects,
e.g. when back-up batteries are exhausted and station blackout is
inevitable. For severe accident management scenarios they must identify
the time before fuel damage is unavoidable and the time before water
begins boiling in used fuel ponds and before fuel damage occurs.
Measures to prevent hydrogen explosions and fires are to be part of
this. Since the licensee has the prime responsibility for safety, they
performed the reassessments, and the regulatory bodies then
independently reviewed them. The exercise covered 147 nuclear plants in
15 EU countries -- including Lithuania with only decommissioned plants
-- plus 15 reactors in Ukraine and five in Switzerland. Operators
reported to their regulators who then reported progress to the European
Commission by the end of 2011. Information was shared among regulators
throughout this process before the 17 final reports went to peer-review
by teams comprising 80 experts appointed by ENSREG and the European
Commission. The final documents were published in line with national law
and international obligations, subject only to not jeopardising security
-- an area where each country could behave differently. The process was
extended to June 2012 to allow more plant visits and to add more
information on the potential effect of aircraft impacts. The European
Commission adopted, with ENSREG, the final stress tests Report on April
26, 2012 and issued the same day a joint statement underlining the
quality of the exercise. The full report and a summary of the 45
recommendations were published on www.ensreg.eu. Drawing on the peer
reviews, the EC and ENSREG cited four main areas for improving EU
nuclear plant safety: Guidance from WENRA for assessing natural hazards
and margins beyond design basis. Giving more importance to periodic
safety reviews and evaluation of natural hazards. Urgent measures to
protect containment integrity. Measures to prevent and mitigate
accidents resulting from extreme natural hazards. The results of the
stress tests pointed out, in particular, that European nuclear power
plants offered a sufficient safety level to require no shutdown of any
of them. At the same time, improvements were needed to enhance their
robustness to extreme situations. In France, for instance, they were
imposed by ASN requirements, which took into account exchanges with its
European counterparts. A follow-up European action plan was established
by ENSREG from July 2012. The EU process was completed at the end of
September 2012, with the EU Energy Commissioner announcing that the
stress tests had showed that the safety of European power reactors was
generally satisfactory, but making some other comments and projections
which departed from ENSREG. An EC report was presented to the EU Council
in October 2012. In the USA the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) in
March 2012 made orders for immediate post-Fukushima safety enhancements,
likely to cost about \$100 million across the whole US fleet. The first
order requires the addition of equipment at all plants to help respond
to the loss of all electrical power and the loss of the ultimate heat
sink for cooling, as well as maintaining containment integrity. Another
requires improved water level and temperature instrumentation on used
fuel ponds. The third order applies only to the 33 BWRs with early
containment designs, and will require \'reliable hardened containment
vents\' which work under any circumstances. The industry association,
NEI, told the NRC that licensees with these Mark I and Mark II
containments "should have the capability to use various filtration
strategies to mitigate radiological releases" during severe events, and
that filtration "should be founded on scientific and factual analysis
and should be performance-based to achieve the desired outcome." All the
measures are supported by the industry association, which has also
proposed setting up about six regional emergency response centres under
NRC oversight with additional portable equipment. In Japan similar
stress tests were carried out in 2011 under the previous safety
regulator, but then reactor restarts were delayed until the newly
constituted Nuclear Regulatory Authority devised and published new
safety guidelines, then applied them progressively through the fleet.
Severe Accident Management In addition to engineering and procedures
which reduce the risk and severity of accidents, all plants have
guidelines for Severe Accident Management or Mitigation (SAM). These
conspicuously came into play after the Fukushima accident, where staff
had immense challenges in the absence of power and with disabled cooling
systems following damage done by the tsunami. The experience following
that accident is being applied not only in design but also in such
guidelines, and peer reviews on nuclear plants will focus more on these
than previously. In mid-2011 the IAEA Incident and Emergency Centre
launched a new secure web-based communications platform to unify and
simplify information exchange during nuclear or radiological
emergencies. [The Unified System for Information Exchange on Incidents
and Emergencies (USIE) has been under development since 2009 but was
actually launched during the emergency response to the accident at
Fukushima.]{.underline}

### 2NC\-\--Renewable Tradeoff Impact

#### Nuclear power is coming now but the transition ignores regulations and hurts the climate

**[[Nuclear power coming now]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Now, an [influx of **[investment]{.mark} from the
government**]{.underline} and [the **private sector** is **[changing the
trajectory]{.mark}** of the aging U.S. nuclear fleet]{.underline} and
[spurring development [of]{.mark} [new]{.mark} nuclear
[technology]{.mark}.]{.underline}

But many of the same old hurdles to scaling up nuclear power remain.
Nuclear is the largest source of zero-emissions power in the U.S.

One factor in the [newfound appreciation for nuclear power is worsening
climate change]{.underline}. Nuclear currently contributes nearly
one-fifth of all electricity generated in the U.S., according to
the [[U.S. Energy Information
Administration]{.underline}](https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=427&t=3),
and is the biggest single source of power that does not directly create
carbon emissions, although wind power eclipsed it briefly for the first
time ever [[earlier this
year]{.underline}](https://www.npr.org/2022/04/14/1092806582/wind-power-energy-source).

In an effort to stave off more closures, [the federal
[government]{.mark} began [subsidizing]{.mark} [older]{.mark} nuclear
[plants]{.mark}, opening up a [\$6 billion fund]{.mark} authorized in
2021]{.underline}\'s Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act this year.
That law also [set aside an additional [\$[2.477 billion for]{.mark}
[r]{.mark}esearch [and]{.mark}
[d]{.mark}evelopment](https://www.energy.gov/ne/advanced-reactor-demonstration-program) of
advanced nuclear reactor technology.]{.underline}

\"Have no doubt, [President [Biden is serious]{.mark} about doing
everything possible to get the U.S. to be powered by clean
energy]{.underline},\" Assistant Secretary for Nuclear Energy Kathryn
Huff told conference attendees. \"[**Nuclear energy is really
essential** to this]{.underline},\" she said.

\"President Biden is serious about doing everything possible to get the
U.S. to be powered by clean energy \... And nuclear energy is really
essential to this,\" Assistant Secretary for Nuclear Energy Kathryn Huff
said. Laura Benshoff/NPR

[[States]{.mark} across the country have also rolled out [more
nuclear-friendly]{.mark} stances.]{.underline}

[More than **half of all states include nuclear power in their
plans**]{.underline} to reduce carbon emissions from electricity
generation, according to an [[Associated Press
survey]{.underline}](https://apnews.com/article/climate-technology-business-nuclear-power-environment-and-nature-cfb21ab68a9e7005cc08873f2a5a7031).

Some, like [**New York**, were already funding older plants to stay
open]{.underline}. In light of California\'s grid stability issues, Gov.
[Gavin **Newsom** started [exploring
options](https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2022-04-29/california-promised-to-close-its-last-nuclear-plant-now-newsom-is-reconsidering) to
keep the Diablo Canyon nuclear plant open]{.underline}, which is
otherwise set to close by 2025.

Even major fossil fuel producer [**West Virginia** recently repealed its
ban on nuclear power]{.underline}. Republican delegate Brandon Steele,
who represents a district in the southern, coal-producing part of the
state, said diversifying energy production is good for business and
energy security.

\"If West Virginia can be a major producer, that serves the energy needs
of the entire country and contributes to our national security,\" he
said.

His argument **[[cuts]{.mark} [against]{.mark} the [climate]{.mark}
case]{.underline}** for nuclear power. Steele tells NPR that he hoped
[bringing [more nuclear]{.mark} and renewable energy to his state would
help [increase]{.mark} [demand]{.mark} [for]{.mark}
[coal]{.mark}]{.underline}, by [increasing the overall demand for
energy.]{.underline}

[\"\[Nuclear is\] a good complement to our coal-fired power. It\'s not a
replacement]{.underline}, [it\'s a complement]{.underline},\" he said.

West Virginia currently has[[ zero nuclear
reactors]{.underline}](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/nuclear/us-nuclear-industry.php#:~:text=The%20two%20new%20reactors%20that,to%20come%20online%20before%202023.). But
Steele said the hope is to get in on the ground floor of advanced
nuclear technology that\'s currently under development.

When it comes to new nuclear technology, the [industry has \"a
**[tendency to overpromise and underdeliver]{.mark}**\"]{.underline}

Despite this momentum, if nuclear energy is going to grow even its
boosters admit some things need to change.

When it comes to new nuclear technology, the industry has \"a tendency
to overpromise and underdeliver,\" [[said John Hopkins, president and
CEO of NuScale Power/NuScale
Corp]{.underline}](https://www.nuscalepower.com/about-us/leadership/john-hopkins),
a publicly traded company working on advanced nuclear technology. His
company was the first to receive federal approval for a small modular
reactor design, but the first plant is not expected to be up and running
until 2029.

\"I want to get one module in the ground and prove we\'re commercially
viable and we\'re going to do it on schedule,\" Hopkins told attendees
during a panel at the Nuclear Energy Assembly in June.

[That means **[cutting costs]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Nuclear
[power]{.mark} has [grown]{.mark} [more]{.mark} [expensive]{.mark} over
time]{.underline}, according to the [[2021 World Nuclear Industry Status
Report]{.underline}](https://www.worldnuclearreport.org/IMG/pdf/wnisr2021-lr.pdf).

By contrast, [[solar and wind power cost less]{.mark} and continue to
[come down]{.mark} [in price]{.mark}]{.underline}, and when combined
with long-term energy storage, could [make nuclear power even less
viable long-term]{.underline}, said Elgie Holstein, senior director for
strategic planning for the Environmental Defense Fund.

\"This is tough competition for these aging nuclear power plants,\" he
said.

Edwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety with the Union of
Concerned Scientists, said [nuclear\'s \"**[unique]{.mark} liabilities
and [risks]{.mark}**, both with regards [to safety and
security]{.mark}\"]{.underline} also must be a part of any discussion
over its usefulness. He points to the [2011 [meltdown]{.mark} at a plant
in Fukushima, Japan, and Russia\'s shelling of Europe\'s [largest
nuclear power
plant](https://publicintegrity.org/national-security/ukraine-in-crisis/russia-captures-largest-nuclear-plant-in-europe-now-what/) in[ Zaporizhzhia,
Ukraine](https://www.npr.org/2022/03/11/1085427380/ukraine-nuclear-power-plant-zaporizhzhia)]{.underline},
earlier this year as examples of what can go wrong. There is also still
[[no model for]{.mark} [disposing]{.mark} of nuclear [waste]{.mark}
long-term]{.underline}, although Finland has created the[[ first
permanent
repository]{.underline}](https://www.science.org/content/article/finland-built-tomb-store-nuclear-waste-can-it-survive-100000-years) for
its spent fuel.

In the race to figure out a way to transition off carbon, energy experts
differ on how much nuclear power should play a part. Many models for
lowering greenhouse gas emissions rely on [[keeping
steady]{.underline}](https://gspp.berkeley.edu/faculty-and-impact/centers/cepp/projects/2035-electric-decarbonization-modeling-study) the
amount of nuclear power that exists now, if not growing it. But
alternative ones, such as a recent [[[Stanford]{.mark} University
[study]{.mark}](https://web.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/Articles/I/21-USStates-PDFs/21-USStatesPaper.pdf),
[show]{.mark} [a]{.mark} **[path]{.mark} [to]{.mark} [zero]{.mark}
carbon [emissions]{.mark} [without]{.mark} any [nuclear
power]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Jason Bordoff, director of the Center for Global Energy Policy at
Columbia University, said [skepticism is warranted]{.underline}
regarding any new energy technology, \"whether it\'s green hydrogen,
long-duration storage, or advanced nuclear.\"

#### Nuclear power is way too costly and inefficient to solve climate change -- investments directly trade off with better renewables

**Schneider and Rueter 21** \[Mycle Schneider and Gero Rueter, Mycle

Mycle Schneider: Today we need to [put the **[question of
urgency](https://www.dw.com/en/climate-adaptation-gap-united-nations-report/a-56220649) first**.]{.underline}
It\'s [about how much we can reduce greenhouse gases and how quickly for
every euro (\$1.21) spent]{.underline}. So, it\'s a [combination between
cost and feasibility, while doing it in the fastest possible
way]{.underline}.

And if we\'re talking about the construction of new power plants,
then [[nuclear
power](https://www.dw.com/en/germany-looking-for-final-repository-for-nuclear-waste-global-outlook/a-56449115) is
simply excluded]{.underline}. Not just because [it is the **most
expensive form of electricity generation** today, but, above all,
because it takes a long time to build reactors.]{.underline} In other
words, [every euro invested in new nuclear power plants **makes the
climate crisis worse** because now this money cannot be used to invest
in efficient climate protection options.]{.underline}

What about existing nuclear power plants?

The [power plants exist, they provide electricity. However, many of the
measures needed for energy efficiency are now cheaper than the basic
operating costs of nuclear power plants]{.underline}. That is the first
point, and unfortunately it is always forgotten.

The second point is that [**renewables today have become so cheap** that
in many cases they are below the basic operating costs of nuclear power
plants.]{.underline}

\*\*Image Omitted\*\*

Let me give you two examples: The [world\'s lowest price for solar power
in currently in Portugal, at 1.1 cents per kilowatt hour]{.underline}.
And we now have the [first results from Spain with costs for wind and
solar power at around 2.5 cents per kilowatt hour]{.underline}. These
are [below the basic operating costs of the vast majority of nuclear
power plants around the world.]{.underline}

It would [often even be affordordable to pay 1 to 1.5 cents per kilowatt
hour for electricity storage in addition to the generation costs for
wind and solar power and still be below the operating costs of nuclear
power plants]{.underline}. And here we have to ask the same question:
How many emissions can I avoid with one euro, one dollar or one yuan?

So why are [construction projects being announced now]{.underline}?

In the case of [[nuclear
power]{.underline}](https://www.dw.com/en/how-fukushima-triggered-germanys-nuclear-phaseout/a-56829217),
I often have the feeling that [**Trumpism prevails**.]{.underline}

projects all over the place, but [in reality, **little or nothing

With our [climate-impacted world now highly prone to fires, extreme
storms and sea-level rise]{.underline}, nuclear energy is touted as a
possible replacement for the burning of fossil fuels for energy -- the
leading cause of climate change. Nuclear power can
demonstrably [[reduce]{.underline}](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421502001921) carbon
dioxide emissions. Yet [scientific evidence and recent catastrophes call
into question whether nuclear power could function safely in our warming
world]{.underline}. [**Wild weather**, **fires**, **rising sea levels**,
**earthquakes** and **warming water temperatures** all **increase the
risk of nuclear accidents**]{.underline}, while the [lack of safe,
long-term storage for radioactive waste remains a persistent
danger]{.underline}.

The Santa Susana Field Laboratory property has had a long history of
contaminated soil and groundwater. Indeed, a 2006 advisory panel
compiled
a [[report]{.underline}](http://www.ssflpanel.org/files/SSFLPanelReport.pdf) suggesting
that workers at the lab, as well as residents living nearby, had
[unusually high exposure to radiation and industrial chemicals that are
linked to an increased incidence of some cancers.]{.underline} Discovery
of the pollution prompted California's DTSC in 2010 to order
a [[cleanup]{.underline}](https://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2010/dec/HQ_10-326_Santa_Susana.html) of
the site by its current owner -- Boeing -- with assistance from the US
Department of Energy and NASA. But the required cleanup has been
hampered by Boeing's [[legal
fight]{.underline}](https://www.boeing.com/resources/boeingdotcom/principles/environment/pdf/Santa_Susana_draft_EIR_Updated_Boeing_Stakeholder_Summary_November2017.pdf) to
perform a less rigorous cleaning.

Like the Santa Susana Field Lab, [Chernobyl remains largely unremediated
since its meltdown in 1986]{.underline}. With each passing year, dead
plant material accumulates and temperatures rise, making it [especially
prone to fires in the era of climate change]{.underline}. Radiation
releases from contaminated soils and forests can be carried thousands of
kilometres away to human population centres, according to Evangeliou.

Kate Brown, a historian at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and
the author of Manual for Survival: A Chernobyl Guide to the
Future (2019), and Tim Mousseau, an evolutionary biologist at the
University of South Carolina, also have grave concerns about forest
fires. '[Records show that there have been **fires in the Chernobyl
zone** that **raised the radiation levels by seven to 10 times** since
1990]{.underline},' Brown says. Further north, [melting **glaciers
contain** '**radioactive fallout** from global nuclear testing and
nuclear accidents at levels **10 times higher than
elsewhere'**]{.underline}. As ice melts, [radioactive runoff flows into
the ocean, is absorbed into the atmosphere, and falls as **acid
rain**]{.underline}. '[With fires and melting ice, we are basically
paying back a debt of radioactive debris incurred during the frenzied
production of nuclear byproducts during the 20th century,' Brown
concludes.]{.underline}

[Flooding is another symptom of our warming world that could lead to
nuclear disaster.]{.underline} Many [nuclear plants are built on
coastlines]{.underline} where [seawater is easily used as a
coolant]{.underline}. [**Sea-level rise**, **shoreline erosion**,
**coastal storms** and **heat waves**]{.underline} -- all [**potentially
catastrophic** phenomena associated with climate change]{.underline} --
are [expected to get more frequent]{.underline} as the Earth continues
to warm, [threatening greater damage to coastal nuclear power
plants.]{.underline} 'Mere [**absence of greenhouse gas emissions is not
sufficient** to assess nuclear power as a mitigation for climate
change]{.underline},' conclude Natalie Kopytko and John Perkins in
their [[paper]{.underline}](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421510007329) 'Climate
Change, Nuclear Power, and the Adaptation-Mitigation Dilemma' (2011)
in Energy Policy.

Proponents of nuclear power say that the reactors' relative reliability
and capacity make this a much clearer choice than other non-fossil-fuel
sources of energy, such as wind and solar, which are sometimes brought
offline by fluctuations in natural resource availability. Yet no one
denies that [**older nuclear plants**, with an aged infrastructure often
surpassing expected lifetimes, are **extremely inefficient** and run a
**higher risk of disaster**.]{.underline}

'The [primary source of nuclear power going forward will be the current
nuclear fleet of old plants]{.underline},' said Joseph Lassiter, an
energy expert and nuclear proponent who is retired from Harvard
University. But '[even where public support exists for \[building new\]
nuclear plants, it remains to be seen if these new-build nuclear plants
will make a significant contribution to fossil-emissions reductions
given the cost and schedule overruns that have plagued the
industry.']{.underline}

Lassiter and several other energy
experts [[advocate]{.underline}](https://energy.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/The-Future-of-Nuclear-Energy-in-a-Carbon-Constrained-World.pdf) for
the [new, Generation IV nuclear power plants that are supposedly
designed to deliver high levels of nuclear power at the lowest cost and
with the lowest safety risks.]{.underline} But other experts say that
**[the benefits even here remain unclear]{.underline}**. The biggest
critique of the [Generation IV nuclear reactors is that they are in the
design phase]{.underline}, and we don't have time to wait for their
implementation. [Climate abatement action is needed
immediately.]{.underline}

'New nuclear power seemingly represents an opportunity for solving
global warming, air pollution, and energy security,' says Mark Jacobson,
director of Stanford University's Atmosphere and Energy Programme. But
it **[makes no economic or energy sense]{.underline}**. '[Every dollar
spent on nuclear results in **one-fifth the energy** one would gain with
wind or solar \[at the same cost\], and nuclear energy **takes five to
17 years longer** before it becomes available]{.underline}. As such, it
is [**impossible** for nuclear **to help with climate** **goals** of
reducing 80 per cent of emissions by 2030.]{.underline} Also, while
we're waiting around for nuclear, coal, gas and oil are being burned and
polluting the air. In addition, [nuclear has energy security risks other
technologies don't have: **weapons proliferation**, **meltdown**, waste
and uranium-worker lung-**cancer risks**.']{.underline}

the end-game**, where very soon humanity must choose between taking
unprecedented action, or accepting that it has been left too late and
bear the consequences]{.underline}." He says 10 that [if we continue
down the present path "there is a very big risk that we will just **end
our civilisation**]{.underline}. The human species will survive somehow
but [we will destroy almost everything we have built up over the last
two thousand years.]{.underline}"   11 Unfortunately, [conventional risk
and probability analysis becomes useless in these circumstances because
it excludes the full implications of outlier events and possibilities
lurking at the fringes.]{.underline}12 [Prudent risk-management means a
tough, objective look at the real risks to which we are exposed,
especially at those "fat-tail" events,]{.underline} which [may have
consequences that are damaging beyond quantification]{.underline}, and
[threaten the survival of human civilisation.]{.underline} Global
[warming projections display a "fat-tailed" distribution with a greater
likelihood of warming that is well in excess of the average amount of
warming predicted by climate models]{.underline}, and are of a [higher
probability than would be expected under typical statistical
assumptions.]{.underline} More importantly, the [risk lies
disproportionately in the "fat-tail" outcomes]{.underline}, as
illustrated in Figure 1. \*\*Figure Omitted\*\*

This is a particular concern with **[potential climate
tipping-points]{.underline}** --- [passing critical thresholds which
result in step changes in the climate system that will be irreversible
on human timescales]{.underline} --- such as the [polar ice sheets (and
hence sea levels), permafrost and other carbon stores, where the impacts
of global warming are non-linear and difficult to model with current
scientific knowledge]{.underline}. Recently, [attention has been given
to a "hothouse Earth" scenario, in which system feedbacks and their
mutual interaction could drive the Earth System climate to a point of no
return,]{.underline} whereby further warming would **[become
self-sustaining]{.underline}**. This "[hothouse Earth" planetary
threshold could exist at a temperature rise **as low as 2°C, possibly

B.3 Global warming, [[reaching 1.5°C in the
near-term]{.underline}]{.mark}, **[[would cause unavoidable increases in
multiple climate hazards]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[and]{.mark} present
multiple [risks to ecosystems and humans]{.mark}]{.underline} (very high
confidence). The [[level of risk will depend on
concurrent]{.underline}]{.mark} nearterm [[trends
in]{.underline}]{.mark} [[vulnerability, exposure]{.underline}]{.mark},
level of socioeconomic development [[and adaptation]{.underline}]{.mark}
(high confidence). [[Near-term actions]{.underline}]{.mark} that limit
global warming to close to 1.5°C **[[would substantially reduce
projected losses]{.underline}]{.mark}** and damages related to climate
change in human systems and ecosystems, compared to higher warming
levels, but cannot eliminate them all (very high confidence). (Figure
SPM.3, Box SPM.1) {16.4, 16.5, 16.6, CCP1.2, CCP5.3, CCB SLR, WGI AR6

B.3.1 Near-term warming and [[increased frequency, severity and duration
of extreme events]{.underline}]{.mark} will [[place]{.underline}]{.mark}
many terrestrial, freshwater, coastal and [[marine ecosystems
at]{.underline}]{.mark} high or very **[[high risks of biodiversity
loss]{.underline}]{.mark}** (medium to very high confidence, depending
on ecosystem). Near-term risks for biodiversity loss are moderate to
high in forest ecosystems (medium confidence), kelp and seagrass
ecosystems (high to very high confidence), and high to very high in
Arctic sea-ice and terrestrial ecosystems (high confidence) and
warm-water coral reefs (very high confidence). Continued and
accelerating sea level rise will encroach on coastal settlements and
infrastructure (high confidence) and commit low-lying coastal ecosystems
to submergence and loss (medium confidence). If trends in urbanisation
in exposed areas continue, this will exacerbate the impacts, with more
challenges where energy, water and other services are constrained
(medium confidence). The number of [people at risk from climate change
and associated loss of biodiversity will progressively
increase]{.underline} (medium confidence). [[Violent conflict
and,]{.underline}]{.mark} separately, [[migration

by]{.underline}]{.mark} socioeconomic conditions and governance more
than by [[climate change]{.underline}]{.mark} (medium confidence).

B.3.2 In the near term, [climate-associated [risks to natural]{.mark}
and human [systems]{.mark} [depend]{.mark} more strongly on changes in
their vulnerability and exposure than [on differences in]{.mark} climate
hazards between **[emissions scenarios]{.mark}**]{.underline} (high
confidence). Regional differences exist, and risks are highest where
species and people exist close to their upper thermal limits, along
coastlines, in close association with ice or seasonal rivers (high
confidence). Risks are also high where multiple non-climate drivers
persist or where vulnerability is otherwise elevated (high confidence).
Many of these risks are unavoidable in the near-term, irrespective of
emissions scenario (high confidence). Several risks can be moderated
with adaptation (high confidence). (Figure SPM.3, Section C) {2.5, 3.3,
3.4, 4.5, 6.2, 7.1, 7.3, 8.2, 11.6, 12.4, 13.6, 13.7, 13.10, 14.5, 16.4,
16.5, CCP2.2, CCP4.3, CCP5.3, CCB SLR, WGI AR6 Table SPM.1}

B.3.3 Levels of risk for all Reasons for Concern (RFC) are assessed to
become high to very high at lower global warming levels than in AR5
(high confidence). Between 1.2°C and 4.5°C global warming level very
high risks emerge in all five RFCs compared to just two RFCs in AR5
(high confidence). Two of these transitions from high to very high risk
are associated with near-term warming: risks to unique and threatened
systems at a median value of 1.5 \[1.2 to 2.0\] °C (high confidence) and
risks associated with extreme weather events at a median value of 2.0
\[1.8 to 2.5\] °C (medium confidence). Some key risks contributing to
the RFCs are projected to lead to widespread, pervasive, and potentially
irreversible impacts at global warming levels of 1.5--2°C if exposure
and vulnerability are high and adaptation is low (medium confidence).
[Near-term actions that limit global warming]{.underline} to close to
1.5°C **[would substantially reduce projected losses]{.underline}** and
damages related to climate change in human systems and ecosystems,
compared to higher warming levels, but cannot eliminate them all (very
high confidence). (Figure SPM.3b) {16.5, 16.6, CCB SLR}

[[Beyond 2040]{.underline}]{.mark} and depending on the level of global
warming, [climate change will lead to numerous risks to natural and
human systems]{.underline} (high confidence). For 127 identified key
risks, assessed mid- and long-term impacts are up to multiple times
higher than currently observed (high confidence). [[The magnitude and
rate of climate change and associated risks]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[depend]{.mark} strongly **[on near-term mitigation]{.mark}** and
adaptation actions, and projected adverse impacts and related losses and
damages escalate with every increment of global warming]{.underline}
(very high confidence). (Figure SPM.3) {2.5, 3.4, 4.4, 5.2, 6.2, 7.3,

B.4.1 **[[Biodiversity loss and degradation]{.mark}, damages to and
transformation of ecosystems are already key risks for every region due
to past global warming and will continue to [escalate with every
increment of global warming]{.mark}]{.underline}** (very high
confidence). In terrestrial ecosystems, 3 to 14% of species assessed33
will likely face very high risk of extinction34 at global warming levels
of 1.5°C, increasing up to 3 to 18% at 2°C, 3 to 29% at 3°C, 3 to 39% at
4°C, and 3 to 48% at 5°C. In ocean and coastal ecosystems, risk of
biodiversity loss ranges between moderate and very high by 1.5°C global
warming level and is moderate to very high by 2°C but with more
ecosystems at high and very high risk (high confidence), and increases
to high to very high across most ocean and coastal ecosystems by 3°C
(medium to high confidence, depending on ecosystem). Very [[high
extinction risk for endemic species]{.mark} in biodiversity
hotspots]{.underline} **[[is projected to at least
double]{.underline}]{.mark}** from 2% between 1.5°C and 2°C global
warming levels and to increase at least tenfold if warming rises from
1.5°C to 3°C (medium confidence). (Figure SPM.3c, d, f) {2.4, 2.5, 3.4,

CCP1.6, Figure CCP1.7, CCP5.3, CCP6.3, CCB PALEO}

B.4.2 [[Risks in physical water availability]{.underline}]{.mark}
[and]{.underline} [water-related [hazards will continue]{.mark} to
increase by the mid]{.underline}- to long-term in all assessed regions,
with greater risk at higher global warming levels (high confidence). At
approximately 2°C global warming, snowmelt water availability for
irrigation is projected to decline in some snowmelt dependent river
basins by up to 20%, and global glacier mass loss of 18 ± 13% is
projected to diminish water availability for agriculture, hydropower,
and human settlements in the mid- to long-term, with these changes
projected to double with 4°C global warming (medium confidence). In
Small Islands, [[groundwater availability is
threatened]{.underline}]{.mark} by climate change (high confidence).
Changes to streamflow magnitude, timing and associated extremes are
projected to adversely impact freshwater ecosystems in many watersheds
by the mid- to long-term across all assessed scenarios (medium
confidence). Projected increases in direct flood damages are higher by
1.4 to 2 times at 2°C and 2.5 to 3.9 times at 3°C compared to 1.5°C
global warming without adaptation (medium confidence). At global warming
of 4°C, approximately [10% of the global land area is projected to face
increases in both extreme high and low river flows in the same location,
with implications for planning for all water use sectors (medium
confidence). Challenges for water management will be exacerbated in the
near, mid and long term, depending on the magnitude, rate and regional
details of future climate change and will be particularly challenging
for regions with constrained resources for water management (high
confidence]{.underline}). {2.3, 4.4, 4.5, Box 4.2, Figure 4.20, 15.3,
CCP5.3, CCB DISASTER, SROCC 2.3}

B.4.3 [[Climate change will increasingly put pressure on food production
and access]{.underline}]{.mark}, **[[especially in vulnerable
regions]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[undermining food security]{.mark} and
nutrition]{.underline} (high confidence). Increases in frequency,
intensity and severity of droughts, floods and heatwaves, and continued
sea level rise will increase risks to food security (high confidence) in
vulnerable regions from moderate to high between 1.5°C and 2°C global
warming level, with no or low levels of adaptation (medium confidence).
At 2°C or higher global warming level in the mid-term, food security
risks due to climate change will be more severe, leading to malnutrition
and micro-nutrient deficiencies, concentrated in Sub-Saharan Africa,
South Asia, Central and South America and Small Islands (high
confidence). Global [[warming will progressively weaken soil
health]{.underline}]{.mark} and ecosystem services such as [pollination,
increase pressure from pests and diseases]{.underline}, and [[reduce
marine animal biomass]{.underline}]{.mark}, undermining food
productivity in many regions on land and in the ocean (medium
confidence). At 3°C or higher global warming level in the long term,
areas exposed to climate-related hazards will expand substantially
compared with 2°C or lower global warming level (high confidence),
exacerbating regional disparity in food security risks (high
confidence). (Figure SPM.3) {1.1, 3.3, 4.5, 5.2, 5.4, 5.5, 5.8, 5.9,

B.4.4 [Climate change and related extreme events will significantly
[increase ill health and premature deaths]{.mark} from the near- to
long-term]{.underline} (high confidence). Globally, population exposure
to heatwaves will continue to increase with additional warming, with
strong geographical differences in heat-related mortality without
additional adaptation (very high confidence). Climate-sensitive
[[food-borne, water-borne, and vector-borne disease risks are projected
to increase]{.underline}]{.mark} under all levels of warming without
additional adaptation (high confidence). In particular, dengue risk will
increase with longer seasons and a wider geographic distribution in
Asia, Europe, Central and South America and sub-Saharan Africa,
potentially putting additional billions of people at risk by the end of
the century (high confidence). Mental health challenges, including
anxiety and stress, are expected to increase under further global
warming in all assessed regions, particularly for children, adolescents,
elderly, and those with underlying health conditions (very high
confidence). {4.5, 5.12, Box 5.10, 7.3, Figure 7.9, 8.4, 9.10, Figure
9.32, Figure 9.35, 10.4, Figure 10.11, 11.3, 12.3, Figure 12.5, Figure
12.6, 13.7, Figure 13.23, Figure 13.24, 14.5, 15.3, CCP6.2}

B.4.5 [[Climate change risks]{.underline}]{.mark} to cities, settlements
and **[[key infrastructure]{.underline}]{.mark}** will rise rapidly in
the mid- and long-term with further global warming, especially in places
already exposed to high temperatures, along coastlines, or with high
vulnerabilities (high confidence). Globally, population change in
low-lying cities and settlements will lead to approximately a billion
people projected to be at risk from coastal-specific climate hazards in
the mid-term under all scenarios, including in Small Islands (high
confidence). The population potentially exposed to a 100-year coastal
flood is projected to increase by about 20% if global mean sea level
rises by 0.15 m relative to 2020 levels; this exposed population doubles
at a 0.75 m rise in mean sea level and triples at 1.4 m without
population change and additional adaptation (medium confidence). Sea
level rise poses an existential threat for some Small Islands and some
low-lying coasts (medium confidence). By 2100 the value of global assets
within the future 1-in-100 year coastal floodplains is projected to be
between US\$7.9 and US\$12.7 trillion (2011 value) under RCP4.5, rising
to between US\$8.8 and US\$14.2 trillion under RCP8.5 (medium
confidence). [Costs for maintenance and reconstruction of urban
infrastructure, including building, transportation, and energy will
increase with global warming level (medium confidence), the associated
functional disruptions are projected to be substantial particularly for
cities, settlements and infrastructure located on permafrost in cold
regions and on coasts]{.underline} (high confidence). {6.2, 9.9, 10.4,

2.3, SROCC CCB9}

B.4.6 Projected estimates of [[global aggregate net economic
damages]{.underline}]{.mark} generally [[increase]{.mark} non-linearly
with global warming levels]{.underline} (high confidence).35 The wide
range of global estimates, and the lack of comparability between
methodologies, does not allow for identification of a robust range of
estimates (high confidence). The existence of higher estimates than
assessed in AR5 indicates that global aggregate economic impacts could
be higher than previous estimates (low confidence).36 Significant
regional variation in aggregate economic damages from climate change is
projected (high confidence) with estimated economic damages per capita
for developing countries often higher as a fraction of income (high
confidence). Economic damages, including both those represented and
those not represented in economic markets, are projected to be lower at
1.5°C than at 3°C or higher global warming levels (high confidence).

B.4.7 In the mid- to long-term, displacement will increase with
intensification of heavy precipitation and associated flooding, tropical
cyclones, drought and, increasingly, sea level rise (high confidence).
At progressive levels of warming, involuntary migration from regions
with high exposure and low adaptive capacity would occur (medium
confidence). Compared to other socioeconomic factors the influence of
climate on conflict is assessed as relatively weak (high confidence).
Along long-term socioeconomic pathways that reduce non-climatic drivers,
risk of violent conflict would decline (medium confidence). At higher
global warming levels, impacts of weather and climate extremes,
particularly drought, by increasing vulnerability will increasingly
affect violent intrastate conflict (medium confidence). {TS B.7.4, 7.3,

Complex, Compound and Cascading Risks

B.5 [[Climate change impacts and risks are becoming]{.underline}]{.mark}

B.5.1 **[Concurrent and repeated climate hazards occur in all
regions]{.underline}**, increasing impacts and risks to health,
ecosystems, infrastructure, livelihoods and food (high confidence).
[Multiple risks interact]{.underline}, [[generating new sources of
vulnerability]{.underline}]{.mark} to climate hazards, and compounding
overall risk (high confidence). Increasing concurrence of heat and
drought events are causing crop production losses and tree mortality
(high confidence). Above 1.5°C global warming increasing [concurrent
climate extremes will increase risk of simultaneous crop losses of maize
in major food-producing regions, with this risk increasing further with
higher global warming levels]{.underline} (medium confidence). Future
sea level rise combined with storm surge and heavy rainfall will
increase compound flood risks (high confidence). Risks to health and
food production will be made more severe from the interaction of sudden
food production losses from heat and drought, exacerbated by
heat-induced labour productivity losses (high confidence). These
interacting impacts will increase food prices, reduce household incomes,
and lead to health risks of malnutrition and climate-related mortality
with no or low levels of adaptation, especially in tropical regions
(high confidence). Risks to food safety from climate change will further
compound the risks to health by increasing food contamination of crops
from mycotoxins and contamination of seafood from harmful algal blooms,
mycotoxins, and chemical contaminants (high confidence). {Figure TS.10c,

B.5.2 [Adverse impacts from climate hazards and resulting risks are
cascading across sectors and regions]{.underline} (high confidence),
propagating impacts along coasts and urban centres (medium confidence)
and in mountain regions (high confidence). These hazards and cascading
risks also trigger tipping points in sensitive ecosystems and in
significantly and rapidly changing social-ecological systems impacted by
ice melt, permafrost thaw and changing hydrology in polar regions (high
confidence). [Wildfires, in many regions, have affected ecosystems and
species, people and their built assets, economic activity, and

settlements, climate impacts to key infrastructure are leading to losses
and damages across water and food systems, and affect economic activity,
with impacts extending beyond the area directly impacted by the climate
hazard]{.underline} (high confidence). In Amazonia, and in some mountain
regions, cascading impacts from climatic (e.g., heat) and non-climatic
stressors (e.g., land use change) will result in irreversible and severe
losses of ecosystem services and biodiversity at 2°C global warming
level and beyond (medium confidence). [Unavoidable [sea level rise will
bring cascading and compounding impacts resulting in losses of coastal
ecosystems]{.mark}]{.underline} [and ecosystem services, groundwater
salinisation, flooding and damages to coastal infrastructure that
cascade into risks to livelihoods, settlements, health, well-being, food
and water security, and cultural values in the near to

B.5.3 Weather and climate extremes are causing economic and societal
impacts across national boundaries through supply-chains, markets, and
natural resource flows, with increasing transboundary risks projected
across the water, energy and food sectors (high confidence). Supply
chains that rely on specialized commodities and key infrastructure can
be disrupted by weather and climate extreme events. Climate change
causes the redistribution of marine fish stocks, increasing risk of
transboundary management conflicts among fisheries users, and negatively
affecting equitable distribution of food provisioning services as fish
stocks shift from lower to higher latitude regions, thereby increasing
the need for climate-informed transboundary management and cooperation
(high confidence). Precipitation and water availability changes
increases the risk of planned infrastructure projects, such as
hydropower in some regions, having reduced productivity for food and
energy sectors including across countries that share river basins
(medium confidence). {Figure TS.10e-f, 3.4, 3.5, 4.5, 5.8, 5.13, 6.2,

responses that are intended to reduce the risks of climate change,
including risks from maladaptation and adverse side effects of some
emissions reduction and carbon dioxide removal measures (high
confidence). Deployment of afforestation of naturally unforested land,
or poorly implemented bioenergy, with or without carbon capture and
storage, can compound climate-related risks to biodiversity, water and
food security, and livelihoods, especially if implemented at large
scales, especially in regions with insecure land tenure (high
confidence). {Box 2.2, 4.1, 4.7, 5.13, Table 5.18, Box 9.3, Box 13.2,

B.5.5 Solar radiation modification approaches, if they were to be
implemented, introduce a widespread range of new risks to people and
ecosystems, which are not well understood (high confidence). Solar
radiation modification approaches have potential to offset warming and
ameliorate some climate hazards, but substantial residual climate change
or overcompensating change would occur at regional scales and seasonal
timescales (high confidence). Large uncertainties and knowledge gaps are
associated with the potential of solar radiation modification approaches
to reduce climate change risks. Solar radiation modification would not
stop atmospheric CO2 concentrations from increasing or reduce resulting
ocean acidification under continued anthropogenic emissions (high
confidence). {CWGB SRM}

Impacts of Temporary Overshoot

37 In this report, overshoot pathways exceed 1.5°C global warming and
then return to that level, or below, after several decades. 38 Despite
limited evidence specifically on the impacts of a temporary overshoot of
1.5°C, a much broader evidence base from process understanding and the
impacts of higher global warming levels allows a high confidence
statement on the irreversibility of some impacts that would be incurred
following such an overshoot. B.6 If global warming transiently exceeds
1.5°C in the coming decades or later (overshoot)37, then many human and
natural systems will face additional severe risks, compared to remaining
below 1.5°C (high confidence). [[Depending on the magnitude and duration
of overshoot]{.underline}]{.mark}, some **[[impacts will cause release
of additional greenhouse gases]{.underline}]{.mark}** (medium
confidence) **[[and some will be irreversible]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
even if global warming is reduced (high confidence). (Box SPM.1, Figure

Climate change impacts, risks and vulnerabilities

[An understanding of [the]{.mark} [severe impact of climate
change]{.mark} on natural and human systems as well as the risks and
associated vulnerabilities is an important starting point in
comprehending the current state of climate emergency]{.underline}.
[Changes in climate indicators]{.underline}, namely temperature,
precipitation, seal-level rise, ocean acidification and extreme weather
conditions [have been highlighted in a recent report by the]{.underline}
United Nations Climate Change Secretariat ([UNCCS]{.underline}). Climate
hazards reported included **[[droughts, floods, hurricanes]{.mark},
severe storms, heatwaves, [wildfires]{.mark}, cold spells and
landslides]{.underline}** (UNCCS 2019). According to the Centre for
Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED), [the world encountered
315 cases of natural disasters in 2018, mainly
climate-related]{.underline}. This included 16 cases of drought, 26
cases of extreme temperature, 127 cases of flooding, 13 cases of
landslides, 95 cases of storms and 10 cases of wildfire. [[The number of
people affected]{.mark} by natural disasters in 2018 [was 68.5
million]{.mark}]{.underline}, with floods, storms and droughts
accounting for 94% of total affected people. In terms of economic
losses, [a total of \$131.7 billion was lost in 2018 due to natural
disasters]{.underline}, with storms (\$70.8B), floods (\$19.7B),
wildfires (\$22.8B) and droughts (\$9.7B) accounting for approximately
93% of the total costs. CRED also provides data on disasters over the
past decade, which shows even higher annual averages in almost all
areas, except for wildfire cases. The economic losses attributed to
wildfires in 2018 alone are approximately equal to the collective losses
from wildfires incurred over the past decade, which is quite alarming
(CRED 2019). Moreover, wildfires are a direct source of CO2 emissions.
Although wildfires are part of the natural system, it is clear that
human-induced emissions are directly interfering and amplifying the
impact of natural system emissions. It is evident that human-induced
climate change is a major driving force behind many natural disasters
occurring globally.

Furthermore, [climate risks such as [temperature
shifts]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[precipitation variability]{.mark},
changing seasonal patterns, changes in **[disease
distribution]{.mark}**, [desertification]{.mark}, ocean-related impacts
and soil and coastal degradation contribute to **[vulnerability across
multiple sectors]{.mark} in many countries**]{.underline} (UNCCS 2019).
Sarkodie et al. empirically examined climate change vulnerability and
adaptation readiness of 192 United Nations countries and concluded that
**[[food, water]{.mark}, [health, ecosystem, human habitat]{.mark} and
infrastructure [are the most vulnerable]{.mark} sectors under climate
attack]{.underline}** while pointing out that Africa is the most
vulnerable region to climate variability (Sarkodie and Strezov 2019).
[It is also important to note the interconnected nature of such sectors
and the associated impacts.]{.underline}

The 15th edition of the global risks report 2020 prepared by the world
economic forum thoroughly presented a number of climate realities,
laying out areas that are greatly affected. The [risks included loss of
life due to health hazards and natural disasters, as well as
**[excessive stress on ecosystems]{.mark}**, **especially aquatic/marine
systems**]{.underline}. Moreover, **[[food and water security]{.mark}
are other areas that are highly impacted]{.underline}**. [[Increased
migration is anticipated]{.mark} due to extreme weather conditions and
disasters as well as rising sea levels]{.underline}. **[[Geopolitical
tensions and conflicts are likely to arise]{.mark} as countries aim to
extract resources along water and land boundaries.]{.underline}** The
report also discusses the negative financial impact on capital markets
as systematic risks soar. Finally, [the impact on trade and supply
chains is presented]{.underline} (WEF 2020).

[An assessment]{.underline}, recently [presented in an]{.underline}
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ([IPCC)]{.underline} [special
report,]{.underline} [covered the impacts and projected risks associated
with 2 levels of global warming, 1.5 °C and 2 °C.]{.underline} The
report investigated the negative impact of global warming on freshwater
sources, food security and food production systems, ecosystems, human
health, urbanization as well as poverty and changing structures of
communities. The report also investigated climate change impact on key
economic sectors such as tourism, energy and transportation. It is
evident that [[most of the impacts assessed have lower associated risks
at 1.5 °C compared to 2 °C]{.mark} warming level. We would likely reach
1.5 °C within the next 3 decades and increases in [warming]{.mark}
levels **[beyond this point would amplify risk]{.mark}
effects**]{.underline}; [for example, [water stress would carry double
the risk under]{.mark} a [2 °]{.mark}C level compared to 1.5 °C. [An
increase of 70% in population affected by fluvial floods is
projected]{.mark} under the 2 °C scenario compared to 1.5 °C,
[especially in USA, Europe and Asia.]{.mark} **[Double or triple rates
of species extinction]{.mark} in terrestrial ecosystems [are
projected]{.mark} under the 2 °C level compared to 1.5 °C**]{.underline}
(IPCC 2018). **[It can be simply concluded that [the world is in a
current state of climate emergency.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

### 2NC AT: Renewables Fail

#### Nuclear is more intermittent than renewables

**Lovins 22** \[Amory B. Lovins is an adjunct professor of civil and
environmental engineering at Stanford University who has advised major
firms and governments in over 70 countries for 49 years, "US nuclear
power: status, prospects, and climate implications," Jan 2022,
energiestiftung.ch/files/energiestiftung/fliesstextbilder/Studien/2022%20Lovins/20220124_Lovins%20final.pdf\]

Nuclear advocates contend that nuclear plants\' normally steady
\"baseload\" operation has unrecognized but large economic, reliability,
and resilience value deserving special compensation. No evidence has
emerged to support this view55. In 2018, FERC (then with three Trump
appointees) rejected 5-0 his Energy Secretary\'s request for new
subsidies to coal and nuclear plants. The February 2021 Texas power
crisis gave no reason to revisit the claim56. On the contrary, those
central thermal plants have proven vulnerable to failure, especially in
a changing climate57.

More broadly, [[big thermal stations]{.underline}]{.mark}, the mainstay
of 20th-Century grids, [have [lost their operational
role]{.mark}]{.underline} and business case in the 21st. Now renewables
with near-zero operating cost are dispatched whenever available; other
units, timely use, and thermal or electrical storage follow.
\"[[Baseload]{.underline}]{.mark}\" units\'
[[inflexibility]{.underline}]{.mark} thus becomes a handicap---one of
the owner\'s reasons for retiring its well-running Diablo Canyon
reactors58. Cycling reactors, where feasible, to follow varying net
loads makes them even less economic to keep operating, so they must run
fewer hours until they go broke and close, to be rapidly replaced by
zero-carbon resources59. How, then, can the reliable supplies
traditionally sustained by those units continue with variable
renewables?

In a sense, says utility regulatory expert Jim Lazar, \"[[nuclear
units]{.underline}]{.mark} have something in common with variable
renewable resources: they [[produce]{.underline}]{.mark} much of their
[[output when]{.underline}]{.mark} it is **[[not
needed]{.underline}]{.mark}** for the grid.\" Nuclear units can\'t keep
rapidly changing their output on demand as renewables can, so to cope
with excess nuclear output at low-demand times, at least 12.2 GW of US
hydro pumped storage plants, each \>1 GW, were built by the owners of
nine nearby US nuclear plants. Their cost was an \"inflexibility tax\".
Ironically, these renewable resources built to support nuclear ones will
be freed by nuclear closures to support an increasingly renewable grid.

[[Giant]{.underline}]{.mark} fossil-fueled or [nuclear [plants
can]{.mark} unexpectedly [lose a billion watts in
milliseconds]{.mark}]{.underline}, often [[for]{.underline}]{.mark}
weeks or [[months]{.underline}]{.mark}, and often **[[without
warning]{.underline}]{.mark}**, or unexpectedly extended from brief to
long outages (as in France in 2020, when the average plant produced zero
output a third of the time). [[The]{.underline}]{.mark} electricity
[[grid was built]{.underline}]{.mark} mainly [[to manage this
intermittence]{.underline}]{.mark} (unpredictable forced outages) by
backing up failed generators with working ones. Diversified portfolios
of [[modular renewables don\'t suffer]{.underline}]{.mark} such
ungracefully massive failures: PV and wind generally falter in far
smaller chunks, and [[their **output varies quite
predictably**]{.underline}]{.mark}---often **[[more so than
demand.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Thus [[the same grid can back up their
predictable variability]{.underline}]{.mark}, more easily and often more
cheaply, with other renewables of other types or in other places (or
demand-side resources or storage). But the need for storage is widely
overstated.

#### Ten [unique technologies]{.underline} solve renewable intermittence and variability\-\--without defense to each of these, "renewables bad" is unwinnable 

**Lovins 22** \[Amory B. Lovins is an adjunct professor of civil and
environmental engineering at Stanford University who has advised major
firms and governments in over 70 countries for 49 years, "US nuclear
power: status, prospects, and climate implications," Jan 2022,
energiestiftung.ch/files/energiestiftung/fliesstextbilder/Studien/2022%20Lovins/20220124_Lovins%20final.pdf\]

At least [[ten kinds of \"grid flexibility resources\" can
reliably]{.mark} balance grids powered largely or wholly by variable
renewables]{.underline}60. Of these, [[utility-scale
batteries]{.underline}]{.mark}, though often profitable, are [the
best-known but currently the costliest. They\'ll become much cheaper,
but probably not as cheap as ample competitors]{.underline}. In typical
order of decreasing cost---and besides hydrogen and non-battery bulk
storage methods like pumped hydro, compressed air, and gravity
storage--- **[these grid-balancers include
[thermal]{.mark}]{.underline}** (heat or coolth)
**[[storage]{.underline}]{.mark}**, electric-vehicle integration,
**[[co- gen]{.underline}]{.mark}**eration and dispatchable-renewable
integration, **[wider [interconnected markets]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
[highly accurate [renewable forecasting]{.mark}]{.underline}, **[strong
demand [response]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, [and **end-use
efficiency**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The latter two resources have lately
turned out to be severalfold larger (yet cheaper) than previously
thought61. [[Just modest efficiency gains]{.underline}]{.mark},
[ice-storage air conditioning, and smart bidirectional electric-vehicle
charging [could run the isolated Texas grid
**reliably**]{.mark}]{.underline} and economically [in 2050 [on **100%
renewables**]{.mark}]{.underline} with no bulk storage62. **[Simulations
denying this simply exclude most of the proven solutions]{.underline}**.
And rather than comparing technologies singly, locally optimized \"clean
energy portfo- lios\"---blending efficient use, timely use, renewables,
and storage---outcompete both fossil and nuclear energy for every need:
energy, peak output, ramp rate, and ancillary services63.

[[Grid balancing]{.underline}]{.mark} now typically costs a few
US\$/MWh64. The evidence suggests it also [[tends to cost less with wind
and solar than with big thermal plants]{.mark}, because big thermal
plants\' failures are bigger, longer, and less predictable, making their
backup costlier]{.underline}65. As Germany\'s renewable share of
generation quadrupled in 2006-20, its grid operators learned even
faster, so reliability broadly improved to five times America\'s. In
2020, renewables\' share of German power demand exceeded 50% sometime in
almost every week, and in half of the weeks it reached between 80% and
nearly 100%. Nuclear and coal phaseouts continued. The lights stayed on.
As renewables and efficiency growth offset coal and nuclear closures66,
Germany\'s greenhouse gas emissions fell by over half in 2010-20, and
the power sector met its climate goal a year early (before the pandemic
depressed demand) with five percentage points to spare.

Careful choreography has lately met annual national electricity demand
with 97% renewables (79% without hydro) in Scotland in 2020, 79% in
Denmark (with 0.06% hydro) in 2019, 66% in Portugal in 2018 (42% without
hydro), 52% in Germany (with 3.3% hydro) in 2020, and 46% in Spain in
2016 and 2020 (27/33% without hydro). None added bulk storage. All
sustained superior reliability, often many times that of the US. They
simply learned to run their grids (as my colleague Clay Stranger puts
it) the way a conductor leads a symphony orchestra: no instrument plays
all the time, but the ensemble continuously makes beautiful music.

This is also how the former East Germany\'s ultrareliable grid operator
50Hertz---half wind-and- solar-powered in 2019, 62% renewable in
2020---intends 100% renewables in 2032. Anyone who thinks we need big
thermal plants to keep the lights on is not paying attention to modern
power engineering, where \"grid-forming inverters\" and fast-responding
power electronics can stabilize grids even better than rotating heavy
machines traditionally did. Some European operators also disconnect
retired coal or nuclear plants\' generators from their turbines67 and
keep spinning them as grid-connected \"synchronous condensers,\" using
their angular momentum to keep on cheaply stabilizing voltage and
frequency68.

[[Extra wind and solar capacity can]{.underline}]{.mark} also
economically [[substitute for giant batteries]{.underline}]{.mark} or
other grid- balancing resources as supply becomes mostly or wholly
renewable. But most of the time the surplus electricity, rather than
having to be \"curtailed\" (wasted) as grid-centric analysts assume, can
be profitably redeployed to tasks not yet electrified---to run heavy
vehicles and decarbonize steel, cement, and other heavy-industrial heat,
directly or by making hydrogen or ammonia. That is, our industrial
economy is easier and cheaper to decarbonize as a whole than in
pieces69.

3\. Other Studies [California]{.underline} attracts a great deal of
attention because it [is a large U.S. electricity market with a strong
commitment to shifting to renewables]{.underline}. [It]{.underline} is
also of interest since it [experienced the largest early retirement of
nuclear reactor]{.underline}s in almost two decades. In fact, it is the
largest early retirement of nuclear reactors in U.S. history. [The fact
that it was handled with relative ease is a good indication that early
retirements are manageable.]{.underline} In fact, the dozens of early
retirements that have occurred throughout the history of the commercial
nuclear sector in the U.S. suggest that, as a general proposition, the
electricity system can manage them well. [The conclusion
that]{.underline} **[high levels of penetration of renewables can be
achieved without undermining reliability]{.underline}** [is supported in
the literature in a variety of ways]{.underline}. First, [there are
other studies of California]{.underline}135 [that reach the same
conclusions, while simultaneously analyzing other U.S.
areas]{.underline}.136 Second, I have already noted that [there are
**numerous studies of other states** that support the basic findings of
these California studies including very diverse areas -- Texas,
Mid-America]{.underline}137 [and the Mid-Atlantic.]{.underline} 138
Third, [there are **numerous studies of other nations**, particularly in
Europe]{.underline}.139 Fourth, [there is a **great deal of conceptual
work** on how integration can be accomplished]{.underline}.140 There are
two important points made in these studies, in addition to the fact that
they support the general proposition that high levels of penetration of
renewables can be achieved without undermining
reliability[.]{.underline} First, **[the finding spans different types
of renewables]{.underline}**. [A study that focuses on California
and]{.underline} the independent system operator in the Midwest,
[MISO]{.underline}, [finds that policies to handle high level of
penetration of renewables work in both cases]{.underline}. The only
difference is that the [leading renewable resources will differ between
regions depending on the richness of the resource]{.underline}. In the
upper Midwest, wind is the economically preferred option. Nevertheless,
a mix of renewable resource is preferable as penetrations rise.

#### Transition away from nuclear enables energy efficiency 

**Lovins 22** \[Amory B. Lovins is an adjunct professor of civil and
environmental engineering at Stanford University who has advised major
firms and governments in over 70 countries for 49 years, "US nuclear
power: status, prospects, and climate implications," Jan 2022,

Efficient use of electricity

[Renewables now cost less than new fossil or nuclear plants in 91% of
the world]{.underline} (soon all), and less than running existing
thermal plants in roughly half the world (soon all)26. [But there\'s
often an even cheaper choice: wringing more work from each kWh by
smarter design and better technologies]{.underline}. \"Negawatts\" are
especially cheap because they\'re already delivered behind your meter,
while electricity generated hundreds of miles away costs an average of
US\$4/MWh extra to deliver. Efficiency typically costs \$0-20 per kWh
saved, but properly adjusting for where it\'s delivered, it has a
negative cost compared with remote supply. So how much can we save?

A decade ago, using the best 2010 technologies, RMI rigorously showed72
how to use US electricity fourfold more productively by 2050, so
2.6-fold economic growth during 2010-50, with all-electric automobiles,
could use one-fourth less electricity than in 2010, yet cost far less.
That\'s part of a tripled-efficiency, quintupled-renewables scenario for
the whole US economy, saving \$5 trillion net present value and cutting
CO2 emissions by 82-86%, with no new inventions or Acts of Congress.
With smart State and local policies, it could be led by business for
profit. That vision tracks nicely to actual market developments since.
Efficiency speeds renewables\' takeover: if, hypothetically, that 4X
efficiency could have been achieved in 2020, then renewables\' 20.6%
share of 2020 US electricity could have been 82%---cleaning up the power
system73 at far lower cost than needing to quadruple renewable (let
alone nuclear) output.

Strikingly, [quadrupling US efficiency in using electricity would save
kWh at one-tenth the cost of buying them today]{.underline}, so RMI\'s
study should have bought even more efficiency! In contrast, by
overlooking the economics of saving vs. supplying electricity, a widely
cited 2020 study74 buys much less efficiency than RMI\'s study did, and
so assumes the US will need 2-4 times more

electricity to produce virtually the same 2050 GDP. That excessive
demand creates problems of land-use, transmission, etc., specified in
minute detail---all artifacts of buying far too little efficiency.
Governments and companies needn\'t repeat that error and risk building
costly supply- side assets that they won\'t need, can\'t afford, and may
not be able to pay for.

Who chooses and how?

Ideally, [everyone could be fully informed, enabled, and motivated to
choose the most clean, safe, affordable,]{.underline} [and reliable way
to deliver **any electrical service desired**]{.underline}, like [hot
showers and cold beer---whether with purchased electricity from
preferred sources, homemade electricity, or using electricity more
productively and timely]{.underline}. In practice, such choices are
blocked by dozens of practical barriers75, each convertible into a
business opportunity, but requiring major policy reforms or
entrepreneurs\' focus and tenacity.

Many entities we entrust with such choices, from utilities to regulatory
commissions to governments at all levels, are ill-equipped to compare or
compete all those choices either, or don\'t bother. In fact, most76
[US]{.underline} [States\' regulatory practices reward utilities for
selling you more electricity and penalize them for cutting
your]{.underline} usage and bill. [This perverse practice creates huge
choice, cost, and value gaps between the best buys and what we\'re
actually offered.]{.underline} [Caring customers in mindful markets can
take many of those choices into our own hands---saving or retiming our
use of electricity, producing our own, trading it with each other, or
buying the kinds we like. This **visionary world is already emerging**.
People with efficient homes and smart appliances have freedom of choice,
giving them more **market power than utilities**]{.underline}. [Add a
smart electric car, or rooftop solar and storage, and the utility
becomes a mere optional convenience, de-moting nuclear power from
uncompetitiveness to irrelevance]{.underline}. **[These trends are well
underway]{.underline}**.

#### Solves extinction

Conservation: Critical to the Survival of Civilization\]

[[Energy conservation is]{.mark} one of the **[critical]{.mark}
imperatives for society today**. Our civilization presently runs on
energy]{.underline} [resources that are finite, and those resources are
being depleted. At the same time, the [demand]{.mark}]{.underline} for
energy [in all sectors [has been growing]{.mark}
dramatically]{.underline}, as illustrated in Figure 1.

figure 1: uS energy consumption by sector, 1960 and 2010

Source: Energy Information Administration, State Energy Data System 2010

[[Aside from the threat]{.mark} [posed by]{.mark} energy [depletion, the
cost]{.mark} of energy [is enormous]{.mark}. Utility bills account
for]{.underline} [**much of** **the cost of housing**]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} they are [a **major cost of business**]{.underline}.
[A large hotel or hospital spends millions]{.underline} of dollars
[for]{.underline} [energy each year]{.underline}. Some [aluminum plants
pay hundreds of millions]{.underline} of dollars [annually]{.underline}
for energy. [In response to]{.underline} [[diminishing sources of
conventional energy]{.underline}]{.mark}, recent decades have seen
[energy [prices]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[are growing]{.mark} [and
becom- ing]{.mark} increasingly [volatile]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[And, the [consumption]{.mark} of energy [brings]{.mark} a **host of
[environmental dangers]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Fossil fuels dump carbon
dioxide]{.underline} [into]{.underline} [the atmosphere, **[accelerating
the greenhouse effect]{.mark}**. [Air conditioning systems]{.mark}
release gases that]{.underline} **[[destroy the]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[earth's [ozone layer]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Discarded lamps
contribute to mercury pollution. [Energy [production depletes]{.mark}
not only the]{.underline} [**[fuels]{.mark} themselves,** [but
also]{.mark} a **[spectrum]{.mark} [of other
resources]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[Most of U.S. energy comes from]{.underline} fossil fuels and other
[depleting sources]{.underline}, as shown in Figure 2. [Only a small
contri]{.underline}- [bution is presently made by sources that are
actually sustainable]{.underline}. [So, new sustainable sources will
eventually be]{.underline} [needed to replace most of our present
capacity]{.underline}. The rest of the advanced world is in the same
boat.

[However, [only a **small fraction**]{.mark} of our current energy
consumption [can be replaced]{.mark} with sustainable]{.underline}
[sources]{.underline} **[[soon]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[enough to
avert]{.mark} an energy [catastrophe]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
[Furthermore, it is not yet clear whether the sustainable
resources]{.underline} in [which we are mainly investing]{.underline} --
wind and photovoltaic energy -- [are]{.underline} actually net energy
producers or [false hopes]{.underline}. Therefore, [[depletion]{.mark}
of conventional energy sources]{.underline} during [this century [has
the potential to **kill**]{.mark}]{.underline} or impoverish **[[a large
part of humanity]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[The potential]{.mark} for
harm [is **greater than**]{.mark}]{.underline} for [**any of the other
foreseeable global dangers**, **including [climate change]{.mark} [and
terrorism]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Energy [depletion would
**exacerbate**]{.mark} **other looming dangers**,
[including]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[war and pandemic
diseas]{.mark}e]{.underline}**. [And, an energy depletion catastrophe
is]{.underline} **[more certain]{.underline}** than any of those other
threats, [if we don't take adequate steps to avert it.]{.underline}

[[To avoid this]{.mark} fate, **[we need a bridge]{.mark}** to span from
the present to a future when adequate new energy sources can take
over.]{.underline} [**[The only possible]{.mark} bridge [is energy
conservation]{.mark}**[, which will allow]{.mark} [us to

energy]{.underline}.

### \-\--AT: Cost

#### **Recent cost estimates prove renewables provide substantially cheaper generation with fewer subsidies** 

**Diesendorf 16** \[Mark, Associate Professor in Interdisciplinary
Environmental Studies in the School of Biological, Earth and
Environmental Sciences at the University of New South Wales, "Renewable
energy versus nuclear: dispelling the myths," April 25, 2016,
http://www.renewablesinternational.net/renewable-energy-versus-nuclear-dispelling-the-myths/150/537/94984/\]

Myth 11: Renewable energies are more expensive than nuclear Variant:
Nuclear energy receives smaller subsidies than RE. Both myths are false.
[Levelised costs of energy]{.underline} (LCOE) [depend on the number of
units installed at a]{.underline} [site, location, capital cost,
interest rate and capacity factor]{.underline} (actual average power
output divided by rated power). [LCOE estimates for nuclear
are]{.underline} \$108/MWh based on pre-2014 data and [\$97-132/MWh
based on pre-2015 data]{.underline} (Lazard 2015). The IPCC estimate
does not include subsidies, while [the Lazard estimate includes US
federal government subsidies]{.underline} excluding loan guarantees and
decommissioning. [None of these]{.underline} US [estimates]{.underline}
[takes account of the **huge escalation in costs** of the
two]{.underline} European Pressured Water Reactors ([EPR]{.underline})
[under construction]{.underline} (mentioned in Myth 3). The EPR proposed
for the UK, Hinkley C, is being offered a guaranteed inflation-linked
price for electricity over 35 years, commencing at £92.5/MWh (\$144/MWh)
in 2012 currency. That\'s now pushing up towards £100 in today\'s money,
almost three times the current wholesale price of electricity in the UK.
The subsidy package also includes a UK Treasury loan guarantee of
originally £10 billion (\$15.3 billion). Its capped liability for
accidents and inadequate insurance is likely to fall upon the British
taxpayer. [In 2015 multinational financial consultants Lazard estimated
unsubsidised costs for on-shore wind across the USA of \$32-77/MWh. An
independent empirical study]{.underline} by US Department of Energy
(Fig. 46) [found levelised power purchase agreement prices in 2014 for
wind in the US interior]{.underline} (region with the highest wind
speeds) [of \$22/MWh, and in the west]{.underline} (region with lowest
wind speeds) [about \$60/MW.]{.underline} The US government subsidises
wind with a Production Tax Credit of \$23/MWh over 10 years, so this
must be added to the DoE figures to obtain the actual costs. In Brazil
in 2014, contracts were awarded at a reverse auction for an average
unsubsidised clearing price of 129.3 real/MWh (US \$41/MWh). [Lazard
estimated unsubsidised costs of \$50-70/MWh for large-scale solar
PV]{.underline} in a high insolation region of the USA. In New Mexico,
USA, a Power Purchase Agreement for \$57.9/MWh has been signed for
electricity from the Macho Springs 50 MW solar PV power station; federal
and state subsidies bring the actual cost to around \$80-90/MWh
depending on location. [In Chile, Brazil and Uruguay, unsubsidised
prices at reverse auctions are in the same range]{.underline}
(Diesendorf 2016). [**Rooftop solar \'behind the meter\' is competitive
with retail grid electricity prices** in many regions of the world with
medium to high insolation, even where there are no feed-in
tariffs]{.underline}. For CST with thermal storage, Lazard estimates
\$119-181/MWh. [Comparing subsidies between nuclear and RE is
difficult]{.underline}, because they vary substantially in quantity and
type from country to country, where nuclear subsidies may include some
or all of the following (Diesendorf 2014): government funding for
research and development, uranium enrichment, decommissioning and waste
management; loan guarantees; stranded assets paid for by taxpayers and
electricity ratepayers; limited liabilities for accidents covered by
victims and taxpayers; generous contracts for difference. [Subsidies to
nuclear have either remained constant or increased over the past 50
years, while subsidies to RE, especially feed-in tariffs, have decreased
substantially]{.underline} (to zero in some places) over the past
decade.

#### **Market fundamentals are decidedly against nuclear \-\-- technological progress and market developments are only making renewables more competitive** 

- **Assumes SMRs/new nuclear (not just old reactors) \-\-- still going
  to get out-competed by other renewables**

C. KEY COST TRENDS [The economic characteristics of the mid-term options
behind the energy cost analysis]{.underline} in Figure II-3 [reflect
**dramatic technological and economic developments** over the course of
the past two decades]{.underline}. Figure II-4 shows long-term cost
trends for three of the most frequently discussed supply-side,
low-carbon options: nuclear, wind, and solar. \[Chart Omitted\] [The
economic competitiveness of renewable resources reflects technological
and economic progress]{.underline}. [Wind]{.underline} already [exhibits
much lower overnight costs than nuclear and solar will in the near
term]{.underline}. [Declining construction costs are reinforce by rising
capacity factors]{.underline}. [For wind, utilization has increased
dramatically]{.underline} and achieved capacity factors above 50 percent
in some cases, **[with costs per kilowatt hour plummeting]{.underline}**
as the result of increasing tower height, longer and larger blades,
better gearbox reliability, material optimization, and more efficient
computer programming.13 [The long-term declining cost trend for solar
has been **driven by both economies of scale and
innovation**]{.underline}. [Each of these factors has made a substantial
contribution to declining cost and both are likely to continue to do
so]{.underline}.14 Solar costs have been falling because of economies of
scale in production, reduced utilization of key component materials,
increasing cell efficiency, and other system cost savings and
streamlining of siting, all of which have lowered the cost of capital.
15 [Storage is projected to be the least cost-peaking power
source]{.underline}, just 10 percent more costly than the higher nuclear
projections.16 [Rapid declines in storage costs reinforce the importance
of rapid declines in renewable costs as low-cost storage can
dramatically boost the effective load factor of renewables.]{.underline}
Lazard's estimate of a rapid decline in storage costs is consistent with
other estimates.17 [Although important local conditions can affect the
cost estimates of power from alternatives]{.underline} --- such as the
richness of wind and solar resources --- [the broad technology cost
trends tend to be global because technology is exportable]{.underline}.
In fact, as shown in the upper graph of Figure II-5, declining costs
abroad have been greater than those in the United States despite the
fact that the United States has richer resources. For example, [solar
costs declined almost twice as fast in Germany]{.underline} as in the
United States [after Germany made a strong commitment to increase
reliance on renewables and decrease reliance on nuclear]{.underline}. As
shown in the lower graph of Figure I-5, cost trends for wind and solar
in South Africa exhibit a similar pattern.18 [In contrast
to]{.underline} the non-hydro [renewables]{.underline}, [over the course
of 50 years of commercial nuclear power]{.underline} in the United
States, **[construction costs have risen persistently without any
indication of abatement]{.underline}**. Small modular reactors
([SMRs]{.underline}), which have been touted as the next big thing to
save nuclear power, [are **likely to be much more costly than the
renewables**]{.underline}. [Investment in SMRs has collapsed, with both
Westinghouse and B&W]{.underline}, the two largest firms pursuing the
technology in the United States, [throttling investment]{.underline}.19
[The combined effect and pay-off of the rapid improvement in
technologies resulting in declining operating, construction and life
cycles costs is to deliver much lower cost, low carbon energy to the
market.]{.underline} As Figure II-6 shows, [there has been a strong
downward trend in purchased power agreement prices.]{.underline} The
Figure is constructed to align the dates, which shows that the break
point came in 2009. We observe wind and solar price declines of 50% in
half a decade. Recent wind prices are in the range of \$20-\$40/kwh;
solar prices are in the range of \$50-\$80/kwh. In an analysis that
projects **[renewables will account for the overwhelming majority of
U.S. capacity addition in the next decade]{.underline}**, Credit Suisse
notes that the prices being paid in Purchased Power Contracts (PPAs) are
already lower than the numbers used in Figure II-3 above, [making them
cost competitive with conventional generation options.]{.underline}
Renewables are cost competitive to even cheap against conventional
generation. [The clearing price for new wind and solar continues to fall
with improvements in utilization and falling capital costs]{.underline}.
For wind we are seeing utilization rates 15--20 percentage points higher
than 2007 vintage turbines, regularly supporting PPA pricing at or below
\$30/MWH that effectively \'creates\' long-term equivalent natural gas
at \<\$3/MMBtu. Lower capital costs for solar have dropped PPA pricing
to \$65--80/MWH from well over \$100/MWH, making solar competitive with
new build gas peaking generation.20 \[Charts Omitted\] [Wind and solar
not only costs substantially less than power from new nuclear reactors,
they are less costly than power from aging reactors]{.underline}. **[The
market fundamentals on the supplyside are running strongly against
nuclear power.]{.underline}**

1\. Long Term Potential [The possibility that renewables could become
the primary source of energy in the decarbonized electricity sector has
been recognized by major research institutions.]{.underline} As the MIT
study on The Future of Solar put it, **[Massive expansion of solar
generation worldwide by mid-century is likely a necessary component of
any serious strategy to mitigate climate change.]{.underline}**
Fortunately, [the solar resource]{.underline} [dwarfs current and
projected future electricity demand]{.underline}... **[Solar electricity
generation is one of very few low-carbon energy technologies with the
potential to grow to very large scale]{.underline}**. As a consequence,
[massive expansion of global solar generating capacity to multi-terawatt
scale is very likely an essential component of a workable strategy to
mitigate climate change risk]{.underline}.57 [The Department of Energy
said much the same about the potential for wind]{.underline} in its Wind
Vision Report, [Interest in wind power is stimulated by its abundant
resource potential]{.underline} (more than 10 times current electricity
demand); [competitive, long-term stable pricing; economic development
potential; and environmental attributes]{.underline}, including its
ability to support reduced carbon emissions, improved air quality, and
reduced water use.58 [Both]{.underline} of these analyses [recognize key
challenges that must be overcome]{.underline} to achieve high levels of
reliance on renewables. **[However, both of the analyses are optimistic
about the ability to do so]{.underline}**. MIT identified three key
challenges -- We focus in particular on three preeminent challenges for
solar generation: reducing the cost of installed solar capacity,
ensuring the availability of technologies that can support expansion to
very large scale at low cost, and easing the integration of solar
generation into existing electric systems. Progress on these fronts will
contribute to greenhouse-gas reduction efforts, not only in the United
States but also in other nations with developed electric systems. It
will also help bring light and power to the more than one billion people
worldwide who now live without access to electricity. 59 At the same
time, [the MIT study pointed to real world experience that suggested
**the path to overcome the challenges is clear**]{.underline}, adding
recommendations for public policy to support that effort. [A number of
emerging thin-film technologies that are in the research stage
today]{.underline} use novel material systems and device structures and
[have the potential to provide superior performance with lower
manufacturing complexity and module cost]{.underline}. Several of these
technologies use Earthabundant materials (even silicon in some cases)...
[Experience in Germany suggests that several components of
BOS]{.underline} \[Balance of System cost, other than solar panels\],
such as the cost of customer acquisition and installation labor, [should
come down as the market matures...]{.underline} net load peaks can be
reduced --- and corresponding cycling requirements on thermal generators
can be limited --- by coordinating solar generation with hydroelectric
output, pumped storage, other available forms of energy storage, and
techniques of demand management. Because of the potential importance of
energy storage in facilitating high levels of solar penetration,
[large-scale storage technologies are an attractive focus for federal
R&D spending]{.underline}. 60 [Given the much lower current cost of wind
and its much higher levels of penetration at present, it is not
surprising to find that the DOE]{.underline} Wind Vision analysis
[argues that "Wind generation variability has a minimal and manageable
impact on grid reliability and related costs."]{.underline}61 DOE
believes that **[operational challenges that could arise with much
higher levels of wind penetration can be easily overcome]{.underline}**
by expanding the use of techniques that have been found effective in the
past. "[Such challenges can be mitigated by various means including
increased system flexibility, greater electric system coordination,
faster dispatch schedules, improved forecasting, demand response,
greater power plant cycling, and]{.underline}---in some cases---
[storage options]{.underline}."

### 2NC\-\--Grid Link

#### Nuclear power is reliant on grid security

**IAEA ND** \[IAEA, No Date, accessed on 7-20-2022, IAEA, \"Interfacing
Nuclear Power Plants with the Electric Grid\", PDF, mimou\]

For a country that does not yet use nuclear power, the introduction and
development of nuclear power is a major undertaking. It requires the
country to build the necessary infrastructure so it can construct and
operate a nuclear power plant (NPP) profitably in a safe, secure and
technically sound manner. A [major part of the necessary infrastructure
is the electric grid to which the NPP will connect.]{.underline} While
most countries already have an electric grid system, it may require
significant development to be suitable for the connection of an NPP. The
[efficient, safe, secure and reliable operation of the NPP requires that
the grid to which it connects is also efficient, safe, secure and
reliable.]{.underline} This paper explains the characteristics of the
electric grid, its relationship with the NPP, and the reasons why a
reliable grid is so important to the NPP. The [grid is the electrical
highway through which all electricity traffic passes as it moves energy
from the supplier ('generation') to the customer ('load').]{.underline}
Interconnected electric grids can encompass several countries and are
probably the largest machines in the world. They consist of hundreds of
power suppliers, thousands of kilometres of transmission and
distribution lines and millions of different electrical loads. Rapid
economic development in the 20th century made the electric grid system a
critical part of the economic infrastructure in industrialized countries
and a permanent feature of the landscape. NPPs are unique and powerful
generators compared to other electricity generating plants. Moreover,
they are both electricity generators and customers. They thus maintain a
symbiotic relationship with the electric grid at all times. [NPPs supply
large amounts of energy to the grid as well as relying on it to receive
power for crucial safety operations, especially during emergency
conditions.]{.underline} The [safe startup, operation and shutdown of
NPPs require a reliable and stable power supply from the electric grid,
referred to generally as 'off-site power'. The grid's principal function
is to transport electricity from the power plant to
customers]{.underline}. But it does much more than that. A [reliable,
balanced and well maintained electric grid is crucial for bringing new
nuclear power plants online and operating them cost-effectively and
safely]{.underline}. In particular, [the grid plays an important safety
role by providing a reliable source of electricity to power the plant's
cooling system to keep nuclear fuel cool after a reactor has been shut
down]{.underline} (although NPPs also have on-site back-up power
available for emergency situations). [The fewer instabilities and
interruptions there are in NPP--grid interactions, the more productively
and consistently the NPP can supply full power to
consumers.]{.underline} Siting decisions must therefore take into
account the local grid conditions and usage, and, because of the grid's
role in plant safety as well as plant economics, integration of NPPs
into an electric grid poses a complex set of regulatory as well as
engineering challenges.

Fig. 4 shows the distribution of outcomes for the Diversion of Material
stratified by country and scenario. For [Diversion of Knowledge and
Technology and Non-state Actor Theft of Nuclear Material]{.underline}
results, see Figure A.2 and A.3 in Appendix A.3. Each point on each
boxplot represents a probabilistic judgment from an expert. The
distributions are sorted by the averages for the No Evidence scenario.
Under the No Evidence scenario, the median expert judgments show that
[**Turkey** has the **highest likelihood of diversion of material**
(53%)]{.underline}, [diversion of knowledge and **technology** (38%),
and theft of nuclear **material** by a non-state actor
(36%)]{.underline} relative to the baseline. This is followed by [Saudi
Arabia for diversion of material (46%) and diversion of knowledge and
technology (37%). Egypt is also judged to have a high likelihood of
diversion of material (38%) and theft of nuclear material by non-state
actors (24%).]{.underline} Across all countries, [the risks shift
upwards in a High-Risk scenario]{.underline}. While the change is not as
substantial, the risks shift down by a modest amount in the BOO
scenario. Table 5 shows the mean, relative standard deviation (rsd), and
changes in the output risk by scenario from Fig. 4. While there is a
wide spread in the expert judgments, Turkey typically has the lowest rsd
and Thailand has the highest. See Appendix A.4 for the expert judgment
means plotted with the standard deviation for each country. Aggregated
distributions represent average expert judgments for each country and
are sorted by the Diversion of Material risk under the No Evidence
scenario (Fig. 5). Fig. 5 and Table 5 show small reductions in nuclear
proliferation and security risks in a BOO scenario compared to the No
Evidence scenario. Compared to the No Evidence scenario, the nuclear
proliferation and security risk average outputs are reduced by 3--4%
under the BOO scenario. The relative standard deviation increases
between 0.06 and 0.08 on average in a BOO scenario, indicating less
agreement among experts on its impact on proliferation and security
risks. Relative to the No Evidence scenario, the [High-Risk scenario
shows **large increases in nuclear proliferation and security
risks**]{.underline}. The average risk outputs are 16--18% higher, and
the relative standard deTable viation decreases by 0.15--0.22 under the
High-Risk scenario. This indicates that [expert judgments become more
centered around the HighRisk scenario mean and that they]{.underline}
[agree on the increased nuclear proliferation and security
risks.]{.underline} We normalized experts' judgments for the High-Risk
and BOO scenarios, by the No Evidence scenario for each expert and
[emerging nuclear energy country,]{.underline} yielding the average
percent change relative to the No Evidence scenario for each country
(Fig. 6). Relative to the No Evidence scenario, the BOO scenario shows a
9--28% decrease in nuclear proliferation and security risk. Relative to
the No Evidence scenario, the High-Risk scenario shows a 59--190%
increase in nuclear proliferation and security risk. [On average across
all risk outputs, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan show the lowest
relative increases (83%, 89%, and 78%, respectively). However, Belarus,
Bangladesh, Algeria, Egypt, Ghana, Nigeria, Indonesia, and Thailand show
a relative increase ≥100% for at least two risk outputs.]{.underline}

3.2. Comparisons between experts Participants in this study had diverse
backgrounds and professional expertise, including 5 from Think Tanks, 2
from National Labs, 5 from academia, and 1 from industry. Fig. 7 shows
each expert's judgment for Diversion of Material for each country under
the No Evidence scenario, segmented by professional affiliation (for
Diversion of Knowledge and Technology and Non-state Actor Theft of
Nuclear Material, see Figure A.5 in Appendix A.5). In some instances,
experts would cluster their judgments for countries together. For
example, Expert F's estimate for Diversion of Material for each country
is between 50% and 60%. Experts B, E, F, G, I, and J would typically
estimate the risk of Diversion of Material for each country to be within
10% of each other (With the exception of Saudi Arabia and Turkey).
Despite their diverse backgrounds, there are [some agreement among
experts]{.underline}. For example, Fig. 7 shows expert judgments were
generally clustered between two ranges, 0--25% and 37--70%. Under a BOO
scenario (See Figure A.6 in Appendix A.5), expert judgments generally
fall between 0 and 13% or 35--60%. Experts B, G, I, K, and L provide
judgments where the probabilities are the same across countries. Under
the High-Risk scenario (See Figure A.6 in Appendix A.5), judgments from
experts in academia, think tanks, and national labs are less clustered
than in the other scenarios. The [Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI)
developed the Nuclear Security Index to benchmark current nuclear
security conditions against theft of nuclear materials]{.underline} for
176 countries (Nuclear Threat Initiative, 2018). The higher the score,
the better the nuclear security conditions are for that country. Fig. 8
shows the Nuclear Security Index for theft and the probability at least
one risk event occurs (Diversion of Material, Diversion of Knowledge and
Technology, or Non-state Actor Theft of Nuclear Material). [**Egypt,
Bangladesh, and Saudi Arabia** have an above-average probability of at
least one risk event occurring and below-average Nuclear Security Index
scores]{.underline}. This suggests that Egypt, Bangladesh, and Saudi
Arabia [currently have above-average nuclear security risks and **will
have nuclear proliferation and security risks** in the future **after
acquiring nuclear power**.]{.underline} Some countries with high Nuclear
Security Index scores ---like Indonesia, Morocco, Ghana, Jordan, and
Belarus will continue to become relatively lower-risk countries in the
future.

At the same time, these efforts fall short for a number of reasons,
partly because [various acts of nuclear terrorism are possible.
Dispersal of radioactive material by detonation of conventional
explosives ("dirty bombs") is a method that is most accessible for
terrorists]{.underline}. [[With the wide spread of radioactive sources,
raw materials]{.mark} for such attacks [have become]{.mark} much more
[accessible]{.mark} than weapons-useable nuclear material or nuclear
weapons]{.underline}. [The use of "[dirty bombs]{.mark}]{.underline}"
will not cause many immediate casualties, but it [will [result
in]{.mark}to [long-term]{.mark} radioactive [contamination]{.mark},
contributing to the spread of [panic and socio-economic
destabilization]{.mark}. [Severe consequences]{.mark} can be [caused by
**sabotaging nuclear**]{.mark} **power [plants]{.mark}**, **research
[reactors]{.mark}**[, and]{.mark} **radioactive materials [storage
facilities]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Large cities are especially
vulnerable to such attacks. A large city may host dozens of research
reactors with a nuclear power plant or a couple of spent nuclear fuel
storage facilities and dozens of large radioactive materials storage
facilities located nearby]{.underline}. The past few years have seen
significant efforts made to enhance organizational and physical aspects
of security at facilities, especially at nuclear power plants. [Efforts
have also been made to improve security culture. But]{.underline} [these
efforts do not preclude the possibility that well-trained [terrorists
may]{.mark} be able to [penetrate nuclear
facilities]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Some estimates show that sabotage of a
research reactor in a metropolis may expose hundreds of thousands to
high doses of radiation. A formidable part of the city would become
uninhabitable for a long time.]{.underline} Of all the scenarios, [it is
building an improvised nuclear device by terrorists that poses the
maximum risk. There are no engineering problems that cannot be solved if
terrorists decide to build a simple "gun-type" nuclear
device]{.underline}. Information on the design of such devices, as well
as implosion-type devices, is available in the public domain. It is the
acquisition of weapons-grade uranium that presents the sole serious
obstacle. Despite numerous preventive measures taken, [we cannot rule
out the possibility that such materials can be bought on the black
market. Theft of weapons-grade uranium is also possible. [Research
reactor fuel is]{.mark} considered to be particularly [vulnerable to
theft]{.mark}]{.underline}, as it is scattered at sites in dozens of
countries. There are about 100 research reactors in the world that run
on weapons-grade uranium fuel, according to the International Atomic
Energy Agency (IAEA). [[A terrorist "gun-type" uranium bomb]{.mark} can
have a yield of least 10-15 kt, which is comparable to the yield of the
bomb dropped on Hiroshima. The explosion of such a bomb in a modern
metropolis [can kill]{.mark} and wound [hundreds of thousands and cause
serious economic damage]{.mark}. There will also be long-term
sociopsychological and political consequences.]{.underline} The vast
majority of states have introduced unprecedented security and
surveillance measures at transportation and other large-scale public
facilities after the terrorist attacks in the United States, Great
Britain, Italy, and other countries. These measures have proved
burdensome for the countries' populations, but the public has accepted
them as necessary. A nuclear terrorist attack will make the public
accept further measures meant to enhance control even if these measures
significantly restrict the democratic liberties they are accustomed to.
Authoritarian states could be expected to adopt even more restrictive
measures. If a nuclear terrorist act occurs, nations will delegate tens
of thousands of their secret services' best personnel to investigate and
attribute the attack. [Radical Islamist groups are among those capable
of such an act. We can imagine what would happen if they do so, given
the anti-Muslim sentiments and resentment that conventional terrorist
attacks by Islamists have generated in developed democratic countries.
Mass deportation of the non-indigenous population and severe sanctions
would follow such an attack in what will cause violent protests in the
Muslim world. **[Series of armed clashing]{.mark} terrorist [attacks may
follow]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The prediction that Samuel
Huntington has made in his book "The Clash of Civilizations and the
Remaking of World Order" may come true. Huntington's book clearly
demonstrates that it is not Islamic extremists that are the cause of the
Western world's problems. Rather [there is a deep, intractable conflict
that is rooted in the fault lines that run between Islam and
Christianity.]{.underline} This is especially dangerous for Russia
because these fault lines run across its territory.

Brighter than a thousand suns. Imagine [a crude terrorist nuclear
bomb]{.underline}---[containing a chunk of **highly enriched uranium**
just under the size of a regulation bowling ball, or a much **smaller
chunk of plutonium**---suddenly detonating]{.underline} inside a
delivery van parked in the heart of a major city. Such a terrorist bomb
[would release as much as 10 kilotons of explosive energy]{.underline},
or the equivalent of 10,000 tons of conventional explosives, a volume of
explosives large enough to fill all the cars of a mile-long train. In a
millionth of a second, all of that energy would be released inside that
small ball of nuclear material, [creating temperatures and pressures as
high as those at the center of the sun]{.underline}. [That furious
energy would explode outward, releasing its energy in three main ways: a
powerful blast wave; intense heat; and deadly radiation. The ball would
expand almost instantly into a fireball the width of four football
fields, incinerating essentially everything and everyone
within]{.underline}. The heated fireball would rise, sucking in air from
below and expanding above, creating the mushroom cloud that has become
the symbol of the terror of the nuclear age. The ionized plasma in the
fireball would create a localized electromagnetic pulse more powerful
than lightning, shorting out communications and electronics
nearby---though most would be destroyed by the bomb's other effects in
any case. (Estimates of heat, blast, and radiation effects in this
article are drawn primarily from Alex Wellerstein's "Nukemap," which
itself comes from declassified US government data, such as the 660-page
government textbook The Effects of Nuclear Weapons.) At the instant of
its detonation, [the bomb would also release an intense burst of gamma
and neutron radiation which would be lethal for nearly everyone directly
exposed within about two-thirds of a mile from the center of the
blast]{.underline}. (Those who happened to be shielded by being inside,
or having buildings between them and the bomb, would be partly
protected---in some cases, reducing their doses by ten times or more.)
The nuclear flash from the heat of the fireball would radiate in both
visible light and the infrared; it would be "brighter than a thousand
suns," in the words of the title of a book describing the development of
nuclear weapons---adapting a phrase from the Hindu epic the
Bhagavad-Gita. Anyone who looked directly at the blast would be blinded.
The heat from the fireball would ignite fires and horribly burn everyone
exposed outside at distances of nearly a mile away. (In the Nagasaki
Atomic Bomb Museum, visitors gaze in horror at the bones of a human hand
embedded in glass melted by the bomb.) No one has burned a city on that
scale in the decades since World War II, so it is difficult to predict
the full extent of the fire damage that would occur from the explosion
of a nuclear bomb in one of today's cities. Modern glass, steel, and
concrete buildings would presumably be less flammable than the
wood-and-rice-paper housing of Hiroshima or Nagasaki in the 1940s---but
many questions remain, including exactly how thousands of broken gas
lines might contribute to fire damage (as they did in Dresden during
World War II). On 9/11, the buildings of the World Trade Center proved
to be much more vulnerable to fire damage than had been expected.
Ultimately, even a crude terrorist nuclear bomb [would carry the
possibility that the countless fires touched off by the explosion would
coalesce into a devastating firestorm, as occurred at
Hiroshima.]{.underline} In a firestorm, the rising column of hot air
from the massive fire sucks in the air from all around, creating
[hurricane-force winds; everything flammable and everything alive within
the firestorm would be consumed]{.underline}. The fires and the dust
from the blast would make it extremely difficult for either rescuers or
survivors to see. The explosion would create a powerful blast wave
rushing out in every direction. For more than a quarter-mile all around
the blast, the pulse of pressure would be over 20 pounds per square inch
above atmospheric pressure (known as "overpressure"), destroying or
severely damaging even sturdy buildings. The combination of blast, heat,
and radiation would kill virtually everyone in this zone. The blast
would be accompanied by winds of many hundreds of miles per hour. [The
damage from the explosion would extend far beyond this inner zone of
almost total death]{.underline}. Out to more than half a mile, the blast
would be strong enough to collapse most residential buildings and create
a serious danger that office buildings would topple over, killing those
inside and those in the path of the rubble. (On the other hand, the
office towers of a modern city would tend to block the blast wave in
some areas, providing partial protection from the blast, as well as from
the heat and radiation.) In that zone, almost anything made of wood
would be destroyed: Roofs would cave in, windows would shatter, gas
lines would rupture. Telephone poles, street lamps, and utility lines
would be severely damaged. Many roads would be blocked by mountains of
wreckage. In this zone, many people would be killed or injured in
building collapses, or trapped under the rubble; many more would be
burned, blinded, or injured by flying debris. In many cases, their
charred skin would become ragged and fall off in sheets. The effects of
the detonation would act in deadly synergy. The smashed materials of
buildings broken by the blast would be far easier for the fires to
ignite than intact structures. The effects of radiation would make it
far more difficult for burned and injured people to recover. [The
combination of burns, radiation, and physical injuries would cause far
more death and suffering than any one of them would alone.]{.underline}
The silent killer. [The bomb's immediate effects would be followed
by]{.underline} a slow, lingering killer: [radioactive
fallout.]{.underline} A bomb detonated at ground level would dig a huge
crater, [hurling tons of earth and debris thousands of feet into the
sky. Sucked into the rising fireball, these particles would mix with the
radioactive remainders of the bomb, and over the next few hours or days,
the debris would rain down for miles downwind]{.underline}. Depending on
weather and wind patterns, the [fallout could actually be deadlier and
make a far larger area unusable than the blast itself.]{.underline}
Acute radiation sickness from the initial radiation pulse and the
fallout would likely affect tens of thousands of people. Depending on
the dose, they might suffer from vomiting, watery diarrhea, fever,
sores, loss of hair, and bone marrow depletion. Some would survive; some
would die within days; some would take months to die. Cancer rates among
the survivors would rise. Women would be more vulnerable than
men---children and infants especially so. Much of the radiation from a
nuclear blast I s short-lived; radiation levels even a few days after
the blast would be far below those in the first hours. For those not
killed or terribly wounded by the initial explosion, the best advice
would be to take shelter in a basement for at least several days. But
many would be too terrified to stay. Thousands of panic-stricken people
might receive deadly doses of radiation as they fled from their homes.
Some of the radiation will be longer-lived; areas most severely affected
would have to be abandoned for many years after the attack. The
combination of radioactive fallout and the devastation of nearly all
life-sustaining infrastructure over a vast area would mean that hundreds
of thousands of people would have to evacuate. Ambulances to nowhere.
The explosion would also destroy much of the city's ability to respond.
Hospitals would be leveled, doctors and nurses killed and wounded,
ambulances destroyed. (In Hiroshima, 42 of 45 hospitals were destroyed
or severely damaged, and 270 of 300 doctors were killed.) Resources that
survived outside the zone of destruction would be utterly overwhelmed.
Hospitals have no ability to cope with tens or hundreds of thousands of
terribly burned and injured people all at once; the United States, for
example, has 1,760 burn beds in hospitals nationwide, of which a third
are available on any given day. And the problem would not be limited to
hospitals; firefighters, for example, would have little ability to cope
with thousands of fires raging out of control at once. Fire stations and
equipment would be destroyed in the affected area, and firemen killed,
along with police and other emergency responders. Some of the first
responders may become casualties themselves, from radioactive fallout,
fire, and collapsing buildings. Over much of the affected area,
communications would be destroyed, by both the physical effects and the
electromagnetic pulse from the explosion. Better preparation for such a
disaster could save thousands of lives---but ultimately, there is no way
any city can genuinely be prepared for a catastrophe on such a historic
scale, occurring in a flash, with zero warning. Rescue and recovery
attempts would be impeded by the destruction of most of the needed
personnel and equipment, and by fire, debris, radiation, fear, lack of
communications, and the immense scale of the disaster. The US military
and the national guard could provide critically important
capabilities---but federal plans assume that "no significant federal
response" would be available for 24-to-72 hours. Many of those burned
and injured would wait in vain for help, food, or water, perhaps for
days. The scale of death and suffering. How many would die in such an
event, and how many would be terribly wounded, would depend on where and
when the bomb was detonated, what the weather conditions were at the
time, how successful the response was in helping the wounded survivors,
and more. Many estimates of casualties are based on census data, which
reflect where people sleep at night; if the attack occurred in the
middle of a workday, the numbers of people crowded into the office
towers at the heart of many modern cities would be far higher. The
daytime population of Manhattan, for example, is roughly twice its
nighttime population; in Midtown on a typical workday, there are an
estimated 980,000 people per square mile. A 10-kiloton weapon detonated
there might well kill half a million people---not counting those who
might die of radiation sickness from the fallout. (These effects were
analyzed in great detail in the Rand Corporation's Considering the
Effects of a Catastrophic Terrorist Attack and the British Medical
Journal's "Nuclear terrorism.") On a typical day, the wind would blow
the fallout north, seriously contaminating virtually all of Manhattan
above Gramercy Park; people living as far away as Stamford, Connecticut
would likely have to evacuate. Seriously injured survivors would greatly
outnumber the dead, their suffering magnified by the complete inadequacy
of available help. The psychological and social effects---overwhelming
sadness, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, myriad forms of
anxiety---would be profound and long-lasting. The scenario we have been
describing is a groundburst. An airburst---such as might occur, for
example, if terrorists put their bomb in a small aircraft they had
purchased or rented---would extend the blast and fire effects over a
wider area, killing and injuring even larger numbers of people
immediately. But an airburst would not have the same lingering effects
from fallout as a groundburst, because the rock and dirt would not be
sucked up into the fireball and contaminated. The 10-kiloton blast we
have been discussing is likely toward the high end of what terrorists
could plausibly achieve with a crude, improvised bomb, but even a
1-kiloton blast would be a catastrophic event, having a deadly radius
between one-third and one-half that of a 10-kiloton blast. These
hundreds of thousands of people would not be mere statistics, but
countless individual stories of loss---parents, children, entire
families; all religions; rich and poor alike---killed or horribly
mutilated. Human suffering and tragedy on this scale does not have to be
imagined; it can be remembered through the stories of the survivors of
the US atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the only times in
history when nuclear weapons have been used intentionally against human
beings. The pain and suffering caused by those bombings are almost
beyond human comprehension; the eloquent testimony of the
Hibakusha---the survivors who passed through the atomic fire---should
stand as an eternal reminder of the need to prevent nuclear weapons from
ever being used in anger again. [**Global economic disaster.** The
economic impact of such an attack would be enormous. The effects would
reverberate for so far and so long that they are difficult to estimate
in all their complexity]{.underline}. [Hundreds of thousands of people
would be too injured or sick to work for weeks or months.]{.underline}
Hundreds of thousands [more would evacuate to locations far from their
jobs. Many places of employment would have to be abandoned because of
the radioactive fallout]{.underline}. Insurance companies would reel
under the losses; but at the same time, many insurance policies exclude
the effects of nuclear attacks---an item insurers considered beyond
their ability to cover---so [the owners of thousands of buildings would
not have the insurance payments needed to cover the cost of fixing them,
thousands of companies would go bankrupt, and banks would be left
holding an immense number of mortgages that would never be repaid.
Consumer and investor confidence would likely be dramatically affected,
as worried people slowed their spending. Enormous new homeland security
and military investments would be very likely. If the bomb had come in a
shipping container, the targeted country---and possibly others---might
stop all containers from entering until it could devise a system for
ensuring they could never again be used for such a purpose, throwing a
**wrench into the gears of global trade** for an extended
period]{.underline}. (And this might well occur even if a shipping
container had not been the means of delivery.) [Even the far smaller
9/11 attacks are estimated to have caused economic aftershocks costing
almost \$1 trillion even excluding the multi-trillion-dollar costs of
the wars that ensued. The cost of a terrorist nuclear attack in a major
city would likely be many times higher.]{.underline} The most severe
effects would be local, but [the effects of trade disruptions, reduced
economic activity, and more would reverberate around the
world.]{.underline} Consequently, while some countries may feel that
nuclear terrorism is only a concern for the countries most likely to be
targeted---such as the United States---in reality it is a threat to
everyone, everywhere. In 2005, then-UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan
warned that [these global effects would push "tens of millions of people
into dire poverty," creating "a second death toll throughout the
developing world]{.underline}." One recent estimate suggested that [a
nuclear attack in an urban area would cause a global recession, cutting
global Gross Domestic Product by some two percent, and pushing an
additional 30 million people in the developing world into extreme
poverty]{.underline}. Desperate dilemmas. In short, an act of nuclear
terrorism could rip the heart out of a major city, and cause ripple
effects throughout the world. [The government of the country attacked
would face desperate decisions: How to help the city attacked? How to
prevent further attacks? How to **respond or retaliate**?
Terrorists---either those who committed the attack or others---would
probably claim they had more bombs already hidden in other
cities]{.underline} (whether they did or not), [and threaten to detonate
them unless their demands were met. The fear that this might be true
could lead people to flee major cities in a large-scale, uncontrolled
evacuation]{.underline}. There is very little ability to support the
population of major cities in the surrounding countryside. [The
potential for **widespread havoc and economic chaos** is very real. If
the detonation took place in the capital of the nation attacked, much of
the government might be destroyed. A bomb in Washington, D.C., for
example, might kill the President, the Vice President, and many of the
members of Congress and the Supreme Court.]{.underline} (Having some
plausible national leader survive is a key reason why one cabinet member
is always elsewhere on the night of the State of the Union address.)
Elaborate, classified plans for "continuity of government" have already
been drawn up in a number of countries, but the potential for chaos and
confusion---if almost all of a country's top leaders were killed---would
still be enormous. Who, for example, could address the public on what
the government would do, and what the public should do, to respond?
Could anyone honestly assure the public there would be no further
attacks? If they did, who would believe them? In the United States,
given the practical impossibility of passing major legislation with
Congress in ruins and most of its members dead or seriously injured,
some have argued for passing legislation in advance giving the
government emergency powers to act---and creating procedures, for
example, for legitimately replacing most of the House of
Representatives. But to date, no such legislative preparations have been
made. In what would inevitably be a desperate effort to prevent further
attacks, [traditional standards of civil liberties might be
jettisoned]{.underline}, at least for a time---particularly when people
realized that the fuel for the bomb that had done such damage would
easily have fit in a suitcase. [Old rules limiting search and
surveillance could be among the first to go. The government might well
impose martial law as it sought to control the situation, hunt for the
perpetrators, and find any additional weapons or nuclear materials they
might have. Even the far smaller attacks of 9/11 saw the US government
authorizing torture of prisoners and mass electronic
surveillance.]{.underline} And [what standards of international order
and law would still hold sway? The country attacked might well **lash
out militarily** at whatever countries it thought might bear a portion
of responsibility]{.underline}. (A terrifying description of the kinds
of discussions that might occur appeared in Brian Jenkins' book, Will
Terrorists Go Nuclear?) [**With the nuclear threshold already crossed**
in this scenario---at least by terrorists---it is conceivable that some
of the **resulting conflicts might escalate to nuclear
use**.]{.underline} [**International politics could become more brutish
and violent**, with powerful states taking unilateral action, by force
if necessary, in an effort to ensure their security]{.underline}. [After
9/11, the United States led the invasions of two sovereign nations, in
wars that have since cost hundreds of thousands of lives and trillions
of dollars, while plunging a region into chaos. Would the reaction after
a far more devastating nuclear attack be any less?]{.underline} In
particular, [the idea that each state can decide for itself how much
security to provide for nuclear weapons and their essential ingredients
would likely be seen as totally unacceptable following such an attack.
Powerful states would likely demand that others surrender their nuclear
material or accept foreign troops (or other imposed security measures)
to guard it. That could well be the first step toward a more **profound
transformation of the international system**]{.underline}. After such a
catastrophe, [major powers may feel compelled to **more freely engage in
preventive war**, **seizing territories** they worry might otherwise be
terrorist safe havens, and taking other steps they see as brutal but
necessary to preserve their security.]{.underline} For this reason,
foreign policy analyst Stephen Krasner has argued that "**[conventional
rules of sovereignty would be abandoned overnight]{.underline}**."
[Confidence in both the national security institutions of the country
attacked and international institutions such as the International Atomic
Energy Agency and the United Nations, which had so manifestly failed to
prevent the devastation, might erode.]{.underline} The effect on nuclear
weapons policies is hard to predict: One can imagine new nuclear terror
driving a new push for nuclear disarmament, but [one could]{.underline}
also [imagine states feeling more certain than ever before that they
needed nuclear weapons.]{.underline}

[The spread of nuclear power plants increases the risk of the
proliferation of all "nuclear" technology.]{.underline}

Specifically, **[uranium enrichment technology]{.underline}**, which is
used to [turn natural uranium into fuel for nuclear reactors, and
reprocessing technology, which is used to extract plutonium from spent
fuel for reuse, are technologies that can be used for nuclear
weapons]{.underline}. [India]{.underline}, in fact, [conducted a nuclear
test in 1974 by extracting plutonium from a research reactor from
Canada]{.underline}\[[[6]{.underline}](https://www.spf.org/iina/en/articles/yuki_kobayashi_01.html#note6)\],
and some have noted that North Korea, which has conducted six nuclear
tests since 2006, cooperated with the former Soviet Union in
establishing its nuclear
technology\[[[7]{.underline}](https://www.spf.org/iina/en/articles/yuki_kobayashi_01.html#note7)\].
With [nuclear technology set to be transferred to emerging and
developing countries, **nuclear proliferation cannot be overlooked** as
a thing of the past.]{.underline}

In response to this kind of proliferation, the [IAEA has implemented
"safeguards" to verify and inspect the use of nuclear
materials.]{.underline}

When the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) came
into force in 1970, it established a system of "safeguards" to control
the nuclear materials of all member states, including states without
nuclear weapons. Japan joined the treaty in
1977\[[[8]{.underline}](https://www.spf.org/iina/en/articles/yuki_kobayashi_01.html#note8)\].
Initially, the IAEA mainly reviewed reports from member states. However,
in the 1990s it received greater authority in response to the discovery
of inappropriate transfers of nuclear materials from former Soviet
states and suspicions over North Korea's nuclear development program. In
1997 the Additional Protocol was adopted and entered into force,
granting the IAEA the authority to conduct unannounced inspections of
nuclear facilities in member
states\[[[9]{.underline}](https://www.spf.org/iina/en/articles/yuki_kobayashi_01.html#note9)\].

However[, if a country that has not adopted the Additional Protocol,
such as Iran or
Belarus]{.underline}\[[[10]{.underline}](https://www.spf.org/iina/en/articles/yuki_kobayashi_01.html#note10)\],
is fo[und to be using nuclear material for non-peaceful
purposes]{.underline}, or if a **[member state refuses to be
inspected]{.underline}**, the [IAEA itself does not have the authority
to take steps such as levying economic sanctions or monitoring the
traffic of cargo ships.]{.underline} The system simply refers the matter
to the United Nations Security Council. As a result, the [system is
**not always particularly effective.**]{.underline}

3. Weapons Proliferation Risk

The [growth of **nuclear energy** has historically **increased the
ability** of nations to obtain or harvest plutonium or enrich uranium
**to** **manufacture nuclear weapons.**]{.underline} The
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ([IPCC) recognizes this
fact]{.underline}. They concluded in the Executive Summary of their 2014
report on energy, with ["robust evidence and high agreement" that
nuclear weapons proliferation concern is a barrier and risk to the
increasing development of nuclear energy:]{.underline}

Barriers to and risks associated with an increasing use of nuclear
energy include operational risks and the [associated safety concerns,
uranium mining risks, financial and regulatory risks, unresolved waste
management issues, nuclear weapons proliferation concerns, and adverse
public opinion. ]{.underline}

The [building of a nuclear reactor for energy in a country that does not
currently have a reactor **allows the country to import uranium** for
use in the nuclear energy facility]{.underline}. If the country so
chooses, it can [secretly enrich the uranium to **create weapons grade
uranium** and harvest plutonium from uranium fuel rods for use **in
nuclear weapons**.]{.underline} This does not mean any or every country
will do this, but historically some have and [the risk is high, as noted
by IPCC. The building and spreading of Small Modular Reactors (**SMRs)
may increase this risk further.**]{.underline}

[The]{.underline} [**[global system to prevent]{.underline}** **[nuclear
proliferation]{.underline}**]{.mark} [and promote
disarmament]{.underline} **[[is beginning to
fray]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Although the nonproliferation regime has
held together for more than half a century,]{.underline} [**[more
countries]{.underline}**]{.mark} are [**[acquiring]{.underline}**
**[sensitive nuclear material]{.underline}**]{.mark} [and technology
through illicit acquisition and preferential trade.]{.underline} In May
2021, for instance, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)
[reported that Iran had accumulated ten kilograms of highly enriched
uranium and severely restricted access to its nuclear
sites]{.underline}. And in October 2021, [Australia, the United Kingdom,
and the United States announced a new strategic partnership (AUKUS) that
will make Australia the first ever nonnuclear state to receive highly
enriched fuel for nuclear-powered submarines]{.underline}. It is
unlikely Australia would divert this uranium to make bombs, [but it
establishes a dangerous precedent]{.underline}. These two cases typify
the growing challenges faced by the nonproliferation system.
Historically, [the framework set in place by the 1970 Nuclear
Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) relied on development limits and
international monitoring of uranium enrichment and plutonium
reprocessing to succeed. But the spread of these sensitive nuclear
materials and technologies is substantially degrading both
processes]{.underline}. [**[It is increasingly difficult to distinguish
between nuclear programs designed for peaceful purposes
and]{.underline}** **[those that aim to yield
bombs]{.underline}**]{.mark}. The IAEA toolkit to detect concerning
activity, flag it, and address it diplomatically risks obsolescence.
[[**To restore**]{.mark} the nonproliferation regime's role as a bulwark
of **[global stability]{.mark}**, international nonproliferation
[**institutions**]{.mark} and states [**need** **new ways to
track**]{.mark} and tackle the development of **[nuclear
weapons]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This requires an innovative approach to
monitoring and constraining dangerous activity. But given that more
countries are acquiring or producing highly enriched uranium, material
constraints alone are not enough. [Monitors [**will need fresh tools to
credibly track**]{.mark} additional indicators of potential bomb
activity that are hard to pass off as peaceful in nature, such as
weaponization: the development and manufacture of nuclear warheads for
missiles or other delivery vehicles]{.underline}. Monitoring this kind
of activity, in particular, goes beyond the traditional focus of nuclear
observers, but it may now offer the best, most reliable way to know
whether states are trying to acquire nuclear weapons. [Given the global
rise in nuclear activity, the world [**should move quickly**]{.mark} to
create such a system.]{.underline} [**[When]{.underline}**]{.mark}
[existing]{.underline} [**[powers]{.underline}** **[are less able to
prevent]{.underline}**]{.mark} [uranium]{.underline}
[**[enrichment]{.mark}**---and even hand over highly enriched material
to other countries---**[it incentivizes competitors to double
down]{.mark}**]{.underline} on their programs. **[When new states
develop bombs, it further encourages proliferation.]{.underline}**
Especially in an era of growing geopolitical competition, [the
international community needs more indicative information on the spread
of nuclear weapons so that diplomacy can head off destabilizing
proliferation and arms races]{.underline}. SHIELDING THE WORLD The NPT
is the cornerstone of the nonproliferation order. It requires that
nonnuclear states avoid acquiring weapons (Article II), allows all
states access to nuclear technology for peaceful purposes (Article IV),
and commits the signatories with nuclear weapons---China, France,
Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States---to eventually disarm
(Article VI). In practice, this regime limits state possession of and
the operation of technology used to produce the fissile materials needed
for nuclear weapons: highly enriched uranium and plutonium. And it
empowers the IAEA to stringently scrutinize nuclear research and energy
programs, enforce nuclear safeguards, and detect clandestine production.
Although its powers of enforcement are limited, the NPT has endured due
to a combination of IAEA monitoring, strict nuclear trade regulations by
multilateral institutions, and commitments by individual member states
to abide by the rules. The United States has historically played an
important role in leading and augmenting this regime, mostly with the
Soviet Union and later with Russia. To uphold the NPT bargain,
Washington cooperated with many partner countries through the Atoms for
Peace program, sharing technology and materials to advance nuclear
energy and research in states that swore off atomic weapons. U.S.
agencies also operated programs to constrain the spread of enriched
uranium and nuclear production technology, promote transparency in
civilian nuclear material, and convert research reactors from high- to
low-enriched fuel. By doing so, Washington further slowed the
accumulation of fissile and sensitive technology. Other nuclear states
supported or at least acceded to these efforts, tightly restricting the
flow of key materials and technologies. The system isn't perfect. There
are inherent tensions in the NPT bargain, which allows some states to
hold weapons while banning others from acquiring them. The world has
experienced periodic proliferation crises that exposed gaping holes in
the regime, such as in 1991, when observers discovered that Iraq had a
clandestine program for producing nuclear weapons. Sometimes, the NPT
has failed to stop weapons development altogether, as happened in North
Korea, which withdrew from the treaty when its program was exposed. And
three nuclear-armed states---India, presumably Israel, and
Pakistan---never joined the NPT. But remarkably, this package has
generally held together for decades. Most countries that at one time had
nuclear weapons aspirations walked them back, such as South Korea,
Sweden, and Switzerland. South Africa voluntarily disarmed, dismantling
the six nuclear bombs it had secretly built, and joined the NPT as a
nonnuclear state. The world averted close calls, including one resulting
from the demise of the Soviet Union, which could have easily yielded
four nuclear states instead of one, and another in Iran, which was
stopped en route in 2003. If anything, the norm against proliferation
has grown stronger over time. Today, only six states without nuclear
weapons have the indigenous capability to produce fissile
materials---Argentina, Brazil, Germany, Iran, Japan, and the
Netherlands---a testament to the efficacy of the regime. But there are
multiple signs that this record may not continue. [DANGEROUS DECAY Some
of the recent problems with the nonproliferation system derive from the
stalled progress toward nuclear disarmament by states with nuclear
weapons]{.underline}. [After [**Russia**]{.mark} and the
**[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates dramatically slashed their Cold
War nuclear arsenals by retiring obsolete systems, arms reductions have
come to a standstill in both countries in the last decade]{.underline}.
Now, they are modernizing their arsenals, [as are **[China]{.mark}**,
**[India]{.mark}**, **[Pakistan]{.mark}**, and the United
Kingdom]{.underline}. This has prompted many nonnuclear states to push
forward a nominally complementary but practically competing UN Treaty on
the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. (The treaty calls for a categorical
ban on the possession of nuclear weapons by the signatories, and it has
been rejected by all nuclear weapons states and their allies.) [Other
issues come from the behavior of nuclear states outside the system, most
problematically **[North Korea]{.mark}**]{.underline}. But the most
worrisome problem is that [the [**barrier**]{.mark} between peaceful
nuclear activity and weapons development is **[eroding]{.mark}**. Most
of the damaging erosion has been done by the weapons states themselves,
via ad hoc arrangements to advance other strategic
interests.]{.underline} Notably, the 2005 U.S.-Indian nuclear deal,
endorsed in 2008 by the Nuclear Suppliers Group---one of the principal
institutions that regulates nuclear sales---enabled the United States
and others to trade technology with India alongside carve-outs that
permitted unsafeguarded Indian nuclear activity for weapons development.
Then, the NPT's 2010 Review Conference affirmed that states pursuing
[nuclear energy had an unconditional right to fully access nuclear
technology, regardless of necessity. The 2015 Iran nuclear deal, the
Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, capped Iran's uranium enrichment
program but walked back an earlier understanding (in the preliminary
2013 Joint Plan of Action) that Iranian enrichment activities would be
limited to what Tehran needed for its peaceful program]{.underline}.
Both the United States and Iran have since undermined the deal, leaving
Iran, according to IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi, enriching
uranium to concentrations that "only countries making bombs are
reaching." There are other prominent carve-outs in the system. [In 2010,
[China]{.mark} violated supplier rules by agreeing to [construct
additional nuclear power reactors in Pakistan]{.mark}, and in 2010 and
2017, [Russia]{.mark} [signed]{.mark} nuclear [deals]{.mark}
[with]{.mark} [Turkey and Egypt]{.mark}, respectively, without requiring
(as far as is publicly known) that Ankara or Cairo forego developing
fissile materials.]{.underline} Washington's efforts to promote a "gold
standard" for nuclear trade, in which recipients renounce the ability to
produce enriched plutonium and uranium, foundered after it was
introduced, in 2009, due to opposition from most prospective clients,
including Saudi Arabia, and the U.S. government's own desire to
revitalize the domestic nuclear industry through power plant exports[.
Collectively, this decay in the NPT's rules has made it easier for
nonnuclear states to obtain fissile materials, [blurring]{.mark} the
primary [distinction]{.mark} [between]{.mark} [peaceful]{.mark} nuclear
programs [and]{.mark} [military]{.mark} ones. [**Countries** **with**
**weapons aspirations can now more easily hide their
ambitions**]{.mark}---and progress---**[in plain
sight]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

V [Until now, what one might call the "**operational code**" with
respect to the deployment of nuclear weapons has differed from that of
other weapons systems. **Wholly apart** from the presence or absence of
**formal "no-first-strike" commitments** and putting aside the question
of their **credibility**, a system of "mutually assured destruction" or
["MAD" **has** effectively deterred]{.mark} any preemptive gamble as
between the major nuclear powers. For these states, essential national
security has come to rest on the ability to ensure that an adversary's
first strike will not disable the target state which would still be able
to **respond** with **devastating effect** on the attacker. Any
**sought** advantage of a first-strike is, thus, **guaranteed to be
pyrrhic**. [This]{.mark} odd, counter-intuitive and even morally
perplexing [system]{.mark} of reciprocal defense [must
**assume**]{.mark}, first, a world of **[administratively
effective]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and not **failed** or **faux
states**]{.mark}; second, the **[rationality]{.mark}** of the principal
actors; [and]{.mark} third, the [**capacity** of]{.mark} their [**early
warning systems** to]{.mark} both timeously [**detect** attacks as well
as]{.mark} to **[avoid false positives]{.mark}**.]{.underline} According
to Murphy's Law, [**[whatever can go wrong in engineered systems
will]{.mark} go wrong.** To date, that category contains only near
misses, both in the United States and Russia, but [it does not take
great imagination to construct]{.mark} plausible scenarios, which,
either because of human **[error]{.mark}**, **technical
[glitches]{.mark}** [or **sabotage**]{.mark}, **do not have happy
endings**. [The peril]{.mark} of the eventuation of unhappy endings
[**increases exponentially** in]{.mark} two, interrelated scenarios;
first, the **[prolif]{.mark}**eration of nuclear states [and]{.mark},
second, the possible emergence of [nuclear]{.mark}-capable]{.underline}
[**[n]{.mark}**on-**[s]{.mark}**tate **[a]{.mark}**ctor**[s]{.mark}**.
To stem]{.underline} the [proliferation]{.underline} of nuclear states,
[the major nuclear powers share an interest in **preserving their
monopoly**]{.underline}. That also requires the cooperation of
non-nuclear states, part of which was secured by a commitment by the
major nuclear powers to cooperate in reducing their nuclear arsenals and
moving toward nuclear disarmament. Article 6 of the 191- party
Non-Proliferation Treaty requires them "to pursue negotiations in good
faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms
race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament, and on a treaty on
general and complete disarmament under strict and effective
international control."42 Although the Obama Administration took some
initial steps to comply with this obligation, no intention has been
expressed by the new Administration to pursue this goal. President
Trump's Draft Nuclear Review goes in the other direction. He is reported
to have said that he would add a nearly ten-fold increase in the U.S.
nuclear arsenal.43 (President Putin, not to be outdone, has trumpeted
new weapons.)44 In the meanwhile, thanks to statements that have been
made, the credibility of alliances, which until now reassured some
non-nuclear states, may be eroding. [The more nuclear states, the more
likely that there will be still more nuclear states. The more nuclear
states, the greater the likelihood that fissile material may reach
**non-state actors**. It is well to remember that the leakage of nuclear
and missile material to nuclear aspirants has not come **only** from
**No**rth **Ko**rea.]{.underline} Under international law, preemptive
attacks against illegal WMD facilities in rogue states are prohibited
but in the two incidents on record, they appear in retrospect, to have
been the right thing to do, based upon their circumstances and the
consequences of inaction. Both succeeded in preventing, at least in the
short term, the proliferation of nuclear weapons. When, however, the
objectives of the military operation were broadened to include regime
change, preemptive actions ostensibly in the self-defense of the actor
may in fact, as the U.S. experience in Iraq showed, result in less
rather than more security, and legal and moral condemnation rather than
approval. That is not to minimize the dangers of allowing proliferation
but simply to acknowledge that [preemptive action under the **guise** of
**self-defense** may, by itself, be an **insufficient tool** on which to
rest national and global security]{.underline} and that [a **broad
program of all-around denuclearization** is required, lest the world
**end with a bang and not a whimper.**]{.underline}

#### Deterrence [fails]{.underline} and prolif is [highly]{.underline} destabilizing -- empirics and expert consensus [prove]{.underline} there's a [high]{.underline} risk of war and accidents 

**Barash 18** (David Barash, Professor of Psychology at the University
of Washington, author or editor of over 40 books, citing a body of area
and field-study experts, The Guardian, June 14, 2018. "Nuclear
deterrence is a myth. And a lethal one at that,"

In his classic The Evolution of Nuclear Strategy (1989), Lawrence
Freedman, the dean of British military historians and strategists,
concluded: 'The Emperor Deterrence may have no clothes, but he is still
Emperor.' Despite his nakedness, this emperor continues to strut about,
receiving deference he doesn't deserve, while endangering the entire
world. **[Nuclear deterrence]{.underline}** [is]{.underline} an idea
that [became a]{.underline} potentially [**lethal ideology**, one that
**remains influential** despite having been **increasingly
discredited**. After]{.underline} the United States' nuclear bombings of
[Hiroshima and Nagasaki]{.underline} in 1945, [war changed. Until then,
the]{.underline} overriding [purpose of military forces had]{.underline}
ostensibly [been to win wars. But]{.underline} according to the
influential US strategist Bernard Brodie writing in 1978: 'From now on
its chief purpose must be to avert them. It can have almost no other
useful purpose.' Thus, [nuclear deterrence was born, a **seemingly
rational** arrangement by which]{.underline} peace and [stability were
to arise by the threat of **mutually assured destruction**]{.underline}
(MAD, appropriately enough). Winston Churchill described it in 1955 with
characteristic vigour: 'Safety will be the sturdy child of terror, and
survival the twin brother of annihilation.' Importantly, [deterrence
became]{.underline} not only a purported strategy, but [the **very
grounds** on which governments **justified nuclear weapons** themselves.
Every government]{.underline} that [now]{.underline} possesses nuclear
weapons [claims]{.underline} that [they deter attacks by]{.underline}
their [threat of **catastrophic retaliation**. Even a brief
examination]{.underline}, however, [reveals]{.underline} that
[[deterrence is not **remotely**]{.mark} **as
[compelling]{.mark}**]{.underline} a principle [as its reputation
suggests]{.underline}. In his novel The Ambassadors (1903), Henry James
described a certain beauty as 'a jewel brilliant and hard', at once
twinkling and trembling, adding that 'what seemed all surface one moment
seemed all depth the next'. [The public has **been bamboozled** by the
**shiny surface**]{.underline} appearance [of deterrence, with its
promise of strength, security and safet]{.underline}y. But [what has
been touted as]{.underline} profound [strategic depth **crumbles with
surprising ease**]{.underline} when subjected to critical scrutiny.
Let's start by considering the core of deterrence theory: that it has
worked. [Advocates of nuclear deterrence insist]{.underline} that
[we]{.underline} should [thank it for the fact that a **third world
war** has been avoided, even when **tensions between the two
superpowers**]{.underline} -- the US and the USSR -- [ran high. Some
supporters]{.underline} even [maintain that deterrence set the stage for
the fall of the Soviet Union and]{.underline} the [defeat of
Communism]{.underline}. In this telling, the West's nuclear deterrent
prevented the USSR from invading western Europe, and delivered the world
from the threat of Communist tyranny. [There are]{.underline}, however,
[**compelling arguments** suggesting]{.underline} that [the **US** and
the]{.underline} former [**Soviet Union** avoided world war for
**several possible reasons**]{.underline}, most [notably because
**neither side wanted to go to war**]{.underline}. Indeed, [the US and
Russia never fought a war prior to the nuclear age. **Singling out**
nuclear weapons as the reason why the **Cold War never became hot**
is]{.underline} somewhat [like saying that a **junkyard car, without an
engine or wheels**]{.underline}, [never sped off the lot]{.underline}
**[only because no one turned the key]{.underline}**. Logically
speaking, [[there is **no way to demonstrate**]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[[nuclear weapons **kept the peace**]{.mark} during the Cold War, or
that they do]{.underline} so [now]{.underline}. Perhaps peace prevailed
between the two superpowers simply because they had no quarrel that
justified fighting a terribly destructive war, even a conventional one.
**[There is no evidence]{.underline}**, for example, [that]{.underline}
the [Soviet leadership **ever contemplated** trying to
conquer]{.underline} western [Europe, much **less that it was
restrained**]{.underline} by the West's nuclear arsenal. **[[Post facto
arguments]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- especially negative ones -- [might
be the **currency of pundits**]{.underline}, but [[are]{.mark}
[**impossible to prove,** and offer **no solid
ground**]{.mark}]{.underline} [for evaluating a counterfactual claim,
conjecturing why something has not happened]{.underline}. In colloquial
terms, if a dog does not bark in the night, can we say with certainty
that no one walked by the house? [Deterrence enthusiasts are like the
woman who **sprayed perfume on her lawn**]{.underline} every morning.
[When a perplexed neighbour asked about this]{.underline} strange
behaviour, [she replied: **'I do it to keep the elephants
away.'**]{.underline} The neighbour protested: ['But **there aren't any
elephants**]{.underline} within 10,000 miles of here,' [whereupon the
perfume-sprayer replied: **'You see, it works!'** We should not
congratulate]{.underline} our leaders, or [deterrence
theory]{.underline}, much less nuclear weapons, [for keeping the
peace]{.underline}. What we can say is that, as of this morning, those
with the power to exterminate life have not done so. But [this is
not]{.underline} altogether [comforting, and **[history is no more
reassuring]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The duration of 'nuclear peace',
from the Second World War to the end of the Cold War, lasted less than
five decades]{.underline}. More than 20 years separated the First and
Second World Wars; before that, there had been more than 40 years of
relative peace between the end of the Franco-Prussian War (1871) and the
First World War (1914), and 55 years between the Franco-Prussian War and
Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo (1815). Even in war-prone Europe, decades
of peace have not been so rare. Each time, when peace ended and the next
war began, the war involved weapons available at the time -- which, for
the next big one, would likely include nuclear weapons. The only way to
make sure that nuclear weapons are not used is to make sure that there
are no such weapons. There is certainly no reason to think that the
presence of nuclear weapons will prevent their use. The first step to
ensuring that humans do not unleash nuclear \[winter\] holocaust might
be to show that the Emperor Deterrence has no clothes -- which would
then open the possibility of replacing the illusion with something more
suitable. It is possible that the post-1945 US-Soviet peace came
'through strength', but that need not imply nuclear deterrence. [It
is]{.underline} also **[undeniable]{.underline}** [that]{.underline} the
presence of [nuclear weapons on **hair-trigger alert**]{.underline}
capable of reaching each other's homeland in minutes has
[made]{.underline} both [sides]{.underline} **[edgy]{.underline}**. [The
**Cuban Missile Crisis**]{.underline} of 1962 -- [when, by all accounts,
the world came closer to nuclear war than at any other time]{.underline}
-- [is]{.underline} **[not testimony]{.underline}** [to the
effectiveness of deterrence]{.underline}: [the crisis occurred **because
of nuclear weapons**]{.underline}. [It is more likely that we have been
spared nuclear war not because of deterrence but **in spite of
it**.]{.underline} Even when possessed by just one side, nuclear weapons
have not deterred other forms of war. The Chinese, Cuban, Iranian and
Nicaraguan revolutions all took place even though a nuclear-armed US
backed the overthrown governments. Similarly, the US lost the Vietnam
War, just as the Soviet Union lost in Afghanistan, despite both
countries not only possessing nuclear weapons, but also more and better
conventional arms than their adversaries. Nor did nuclear weapons aid
Russia in its unsuccessful war against Chechen rebels in 1994-96, or in
1999-2000, when Russia's conventional weapons devastated the suffering
Chechen Republic. Nuclear weapons did not help the US achieve its goals
in Iraq or Afghanistan, which have become expensive catastrophic
failures for the country with the world's most advanced nuclear weapons.
Moreover, despite its nuclear arsenal, the US remains fearful of
domestic terrorist attacks, which are more likely to be made with
nuclear weapons than be deterred by them. In short, it is not legitimate
to argue that nuclear weapons have deterred any sort of war, or that
they will do so in the future. During the Cold War, each side engaged in
conventional warfare: the Soviets, for example, in Hungary (1956),
Czechoslovakia (1968), and Afghanistan (1979-89); the Russians in
Chechnya (1994-96; 1999-2009), Georgia (2008), Ukraine (2014-present),
as well as Syria (2015-present); and the US in Korea (1950-53), Vietnam
(1955-75), Lebanon (1982), Grenada (1983), Panama (1989-90), the Persian
Gulf (1990-91), the former Yugoslavia (1991-99), Afghanistan
(2001-present), and Iraq (2003-present), to mention just a few cases.
Nor have their weapons deterred attacks upon nuclear armed states by
non-nuclear opponents. In 1950, China stood 14 years from developing and
deploying its own nuclear weapons, whereas the US had a well-developed
atomic arsenal. Nonetheless, as the Korean War's tide was shifting
dramatically against the North, that US nuclear arsenal did not inhibit
China from sending more than 300,000 soldiers across the Yalu River,
resulting in the stalemate on the Korean peninsula that divides it to
this day, and has resulted in one of the world's most dangerous
unresolved stand-offs. In 1956, the nuclear-armed United Kingdom warned
non-nuclear Egypt to refrain from nationalising the Suez Canal. To no
avail: the UK, France and Israel ended up invading Sinai with
conventional forces. In 1982, Argentina attacked the British-held
Falkland Islands, even though the UK had nuclear weapons and Argentina
did not. Following the US-led invasion in 1991, conventionally armed
Iraq was not deterred from lobbing Scud missiles at nuclear-armed
Israel, which did not retaliate, although it could have used its nuclear
weapons to vaporise Baghdad. It is hard to imagine how doing so would
have benefitted anyone. Obviously, US nuclear weapons did not deter the
terrorist attacks on the US of 11 September 2001, just as the nuclear
arsenals of the UK and France have not prevented repeated terrorist
attacks on those countries. **[Deterrence, in short, does not
deter.]{.underline}** [The pattern is **deep and geographically
widespread**]{.underline}. Nuclear-armed France couldn't prevail over
the non-nuclear Algerian National Liberation Front. The US nuclear
arsenal didn't inhibit North Korea from seizing a US
intelligence-gathering vessel, the USS Pueblo, in 1968. Even today, this
boat remains in North Korean hands. US nukes didn't enable China to get
Vietnam to end its invasion of Cambodia in 1979. Nor did US nuclear
weapons stop Iranian Revolutionary Guards from capturing US diplomats
and holding them hostage (1979-81), just as fear of US nuclear weapons
didn't empower the US and its allies to force Iraq to retreat from
Kuwait without a fight in 1990. In Nuclear Weapons and Coercive
Diplomacy (2017), the political scientists Todd Sechser and Matthew
**[[Fuhrmann]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[examined]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[348]{.mark} territorial [disputes]{.mark}]{.underline}** [occurring
between 1919 and 1995]{.underline}. [They used **statistical analysis**
[to see whether]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[nuclear]{.mark}-armed
[states]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[were]{.mark} more
[successful]{.mark}]{.underline} than conventional countries in coercing
their adversaries during territorial disputes. **[[They
weren't]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Not only that, but nuclear weapons
didn't embolden those who own them to escalate demands; if anything,
such countries were somewhat less successful in getting their way. In
some cases, **[the analysis is almost comical]{.underline}**. Thus,
among the very few cases in which threats from a nuclear-armed country
were coded as having compelled an opponent was the US insistence, in
1961, that the Dominican Republic hold democratic elections following
the assassination of the dictator Rafael Trujillo, as well as the US
demand, in 1994, following a Haitian military coup, that the Haitian
colonels restore Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power. In 1974-75, nuclear
China forced non-nuclear Portugal to surrender its claim to Macau. These
examples were included because the authors honestly sought to consider
all cases in which a nuclear-armed country got its way vis-à-vis a
non-nuclear one. But no serious observer would attribute the
capitulation of Portugal or the Dominican Republic to the nuclear
weapons of China or the US. All of this also suggests that the
acquisition of nuclear weapons by Iran or North Korea is unlikely to
enable these countries to coerce others, whether their 'targets' are
armed with nuclear or conventional weapons. It is one thing to conclude
that nuclear deterrence hasn't necessarily deterred, and hasn't provided
coercive power -- but its extraordinary risks are even more
discrediting. First, [[**deterrence**]{.mark} via nuclear weapons
**[lacks credibility]{.mark}**]{.underline}. A police officer armed with
a backpack nuclear weapon would be unlikely to deter a robber: 'Stop in
the name of the law, or I'll blow us all up!' Similarly, [during the
Cold War, NATO generals lamented that]{.underline} towns in West Germany
were less than two kilotons apart -- which meant that defending Europe
with nuclear weapons would destroy it, and so [the claim that the Red
Army would be deterred by nuclear means was **literally incredible**.
The result was the elaboration of smaller, **more accurate tactical
weapons**]{.underline} that would be more usable and, thus, [whose
employment in a crisis would be more credible. But deployed
weapons]{.underline} that [**are more usable**, and]{.underline} thus
[**more credible as deterrents**, are more liable to be used. Second,
[deterrence requires]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[each]{.mark} side's
[arsenal **remains invulnerable**]{.mark}]{.underline} to attack, [or at
least that such an attack would be prevented insofar as a potential
victim **retained a 'second-strike' retaliatory capability**, sufficient
to prevent]{.underline} such an [attack **in the first
place**]{.underline}. Over time, however, [nuclear missiles have become
increasingly accurate, raising concerns about]{.underline} the
[vulnerability]{.underline} of these weapons [to a 'counterforce'
strike]{.underline}. In brief, [nuclear states are **increasingly able**
to target their adversary's]{.underline} nuclear [weapons for
destruction. In the **perverse argot** of deterrence]{.underline}
theory, [this is called **[counterforce]{.mark}
vulnerability**]{.underline}, with 'vulnerability' [referring to the
target's nuclear weapons, not]{.underline} its [population. The
**clearest outcome** of]{.underline} increasingly accurate nuclear
weapons and the 'counterforce vulnerability' component of deterrence
theory [is to **[increase]{.mark} the [likelihood of]{.mark} a [first
strike]{.mark}**[, while]{.mark}]{.underline} also
[**[increasing]{.mark} [the danger]{.mark}** []{.mark}that a potential
victim]{.underline}, fearing such an event, [might be tempted [to
**pre-empt** ]{.mark}**with its own first strike**. The resulting
situation -- in which each side **perceives**]{.underline} a possible
[**advantage** in striking first -- is **dangerously
unstable**]{.underline}. Third, [[deterrence]{.mark} theory **[assumes
optimal rationality]{.mark}** on the part of decision-makers. It
presumes]{.underline} that [those with their fingers on the **nuclear
triggers** are **rational actors** who will]{.underline} also [remain
calm]{.underline} [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} cognitively unimpaired
[under extremely stressful conditions. It]{.underline} also
[presumes]{.underline} that [leaders will **always retain control** over
their]{.underline} forces and that, moreover, they will always retain
control over their emotions as well, [making decisions based **solely on
a [cool calculation]{.mark}** of strategic costs]{.underline} and
benefits. [Deterrence theory maintains]{.underline}, in short, [[that
each side will]{.mark} **[scare the pants off the other]{.mark}**
with]{.underline} the prospect of [the most **hideous, unimaginable
consequences**, [and]{.mark}]{.underline} will [[then conduct]{.mark}
itself [with]{.mark} the **utmost deliberate and [precise
rationality]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Virtually [everything known
about human **[psychology]{.mark}** [suggests]{.mark}]{.underline} that
**[[this is]{.mark} [absurd]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In Black Lamb and
Grey Falcon: A Journey Through Yugoslavia (1941), Rebecca West noted
that: 'Only part of us is sane: only part of us loves pleasure and the
longer day of happiness, wants to live to our 90s and die in peace ...['
It requires no arcane wisdom to know]{.underline} that
[[people]{.underline}]{.mark} often [[act out of
**misperceptions**]{.underline}]{.mark}, anger, despair, insanity,
stubbornness, revenge, pride and/[or dogmatic conviction]{.underline}.
Moreover, [in certain situations]{.underline} -- [as when either side is
**convinced that war is inevitable**, or when]{.underline} the
[pressures to avoid losing]{.underline} face [are **especially intense**
-- an irrational act, including a **lethal one**, can
appear]{.underline} appropriate, even [unavoidable]{.underline}. When he
ordered the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Japanese defence minister
observed that: 'Sometimes it is necessary to close one's eyes and jump
off the platform of the Kiyomizu Temple \[a renowned suicide spot\].'
During the First World War, Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany wrote in the
margin of a government document that: 'Even if we are destroyed, England
at least will lose India.' While in his bunker, during the final days of
the Second World War, Adolf Hitler ordered what he hoped would be the
total destruction of Germany, because he felt that Germans had 'failed'
him. [Consider]{.underline}, as well, [a US president who shows signs of
mental illness, and whose statements]{.underline} and tweets [are
**frighteningly consistent** with dementia or]{.underline} genuine
[psychosis. National leaders]{.underline} -- nuclear-armed or not --
[aren't immune to mental illness. Yet, deterrence]{.underline} theory
**[presumes otherwise]{.underline}**. Finally, [there is **just no way**
for]{.underline} civilian or [**military leaders to know** when their
country]{.underline} has [**accumulated enough nuclear firepower** to
**satisfy the requirement** of having an 'effective
deterrent']{.underline}. For example, [[if one]{.mark} side [is
**willing to be annihilated**]{.mark}]{.underline} in a counterattack,
[**[it]{.mark} simply [cannot be deterred]{.mark}**, no matter the
threatened retaliation]{.underline}. Alternatively[, [if
one]{.underline}]{.mark} [side [is **convinced** of the
other's]{.mark}]{.underline} implacable
[[hostility]{.underline}]{.mark}, or of its presumed indifference to
loss of life, [[**no amount of weaponry** can
suffice]{.underline}]{.mark}. Not only that, but [so long as
accumulating weapons **makes money**]{.underline} for defence
contractors, [and so long as]{.underline} designing, producing and
deploying [new 'generations' of nuclear stuff advances]{.underline}
careers, the [truth about deterrence theory will **remain
obscured**]{.underline}. Even the sky is not the limit; militarists want
to put weapons in outer space. Insofar as nuclear weapons also serve
symbolic, psychological needs, [by demonstrating the **technological
accomplishments**]{.underline} of a nation [and]{.underline} thus
[conveying legitimacy to]{.underline} otherwise **[insecure leaders and
countries]{.underline}**, then, once again, [there is no **rational
way** to establish the minimum]{.underline} (or cap the maximum) [size
of one's arsenal]{.underline}. At some point, [additional
detonations]{.underline} nonetheless [come up against the **law of
diminishing returns**]{.underline}, or as Winston Churchill pointed out,
they simply 'make the rubble bounce'. In addition, ethical deterrence is
an oxymoron. Theologians know that a nuclear war could never meet
so-called 'just war' criteria. In 1966, the Second Vatican Council
concluded: 'Any act of war aimed indiscriminately at the destruction of
entire cities or of extensive areas along with their populations is a
crime against God and man itself. It merits unequivocal and unhesitating
condemnation.' And in a pastoral letter in 1983, the US Catholic bishops
added: 'This condemnation, in our judgment, applies even to the
retaliatory use of weapons striking enemy cities after our own have
already been struck.' They continued that, if something is immoral to
do, then it is also immoral to threaten. In a message to the 2014 Vienna
Conference on the Humanitarian Impact of Nuclear Weapons, Pope Francis
declared that: ['Nuclear deterrence and]{.underline} the threat of
[mutually assured destruction cannot be the basis of]{.underline} an
ethics of fraternity and **[peaceful coexistence]{.underline}** among
peoples and states.' The United Methodist Council of Bishops go further
than their Catholic counterparts, concluding in 1986 that: 'Deterrence
must no longer receive the churches' blessing, even as a temporary
warrant for the maintenance of nuclear weapons.' In The Just War (1968),
the Protestant ethicist Paul Ramsey asked his readers to imagine that
traffic accidents in a particular city had suddenly been reduced to
zero, after which it was found that everyone had been required to strap
a newborn infant to the bumper of every car. Perhaps [the most
frightening thing about nuclear deterrence is its **many paths to
failure**. Contrary to what is widely assumed, the **least likely** is a
**'bolt out of the blue'**]{.underline} (BOOB) attack. Meanwhile, [there
are **substantial risks**]{.underline} associated [with
**[escalated]{.mark} conventional [war, accidental or unauthorised
use]{.mark}**]{.underline}, irrational use (although it can be argued
that any use of nuclear weapons would be irrational) [[or **false
alarms**,]{.mark} which]{.underline} have [[happen]{.mark}ed [with
**frightening regularity**, and could lead to **'retaliation'**
]{.mark}**against an attack that hadn't happened**[. There have]{.mark}
also [been]{.mark} numerous **['broken arrow'
accidents]{.mark}**]{.underline} -- accidental [launching, firing, theft
or loss of a nuclear]{.underline} weapon -- as well as circumstances in
which such [events as [a **flock of geese**]{.mark}**, a ruptured gas
pipeline [or faulty computer codes]{.mark}** [have been interpreted
as]{.mark} a **[hostile]{.mark} missile [launch]{.mark}**[.]{.mark} The
above describes]{.underline} only some of the [**inadequacies** and
**outright dangers**]{.underline} posed [by deterrence, the **doctrinal
fulcrum** that manipulates nuclear]{.underline} hardware, software,
deployments, accumulation and [escalation. Undoing the
ideology]{.underline} -- verging on theology -- of deterrence [won't be
easy, but neither is living under the **threat of worldwide
annihilation**]{.underline}. As the poet T S Eliot once wrote, unless
you are in over your head, how do you know how tall you are? And when it
comes to nuclear deterrence, we're all in over our heads.

TerraPower and DOE [[expect to
build](https://www.energy.senate.gov/hearings/2021/3/full-committee-hearing-on-nuclear-energy) hundreds
of fast reactors for domestic use and export.  ]{.underline}

Unlike conventional nuclear plants that exploit fission reactions
triggered by slow neutrons, [[fast
reactors]{.underline}](https://nationalinterest.org/feature/dangerous-decisions-about-advanced-nuclear-reactors-could-lead-new-threats-183934) maintain
nuclear chain reactions with much more energetic fast neutrons. These
reactors are billed as advanced technology, but they are an old idea.
The first fast reactor designs date back to post-World War II.

Fast reactors' main advantage is that they can make [[lots of
plutonium]{.underline}](https://nationalinterest.org/feature/are-washington%E2%80%99s-advanced-reactors-nuclear-waste-43797),
which can be extracted and used as reactor fuel instead of mining and
using more uranium. This sounded good, so good to the Nixon
administration that it set a goal to shift electric generation to
plutonium-fueled fast reactors by the turn of the century. But the
project came a cropper when it ran into safety hurdles that escalated
costs. And then the increased awareness of the dangers of putting
plutonium---one of the [[two key nuclear
explosives]{.underline}](https://nationalinterest.org/feature/nuclear-power-must-not-lead-nuclear-bombs-75901)---into
the world's commercial channels finally caused President Gerald Ford
to[[ announce]{.underline}](https://www.nrc.gov/docs/ml1209/ML120960611.pdf) the
United States would not rely on plutonium fuel until the world could
cope with it.    

TerraPower is [[obviously
aware]{.underline}](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/bill-gates%E2%80%99-fast-nuclear-reactor-will-it-bomb-189967) of
this history and the public relations landmine it creates for its
demonstration project. It insists its Natrium reactor will not use
plutonium as fuel or require reprocessing to extract it. The company's
website[[ says]{.underline}](https://www.terrapower.com/our-work/natriumpower/),
"Both the demonstration plant and the first set of commercial plants
will run on high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU)." HALEU is uranium
enriched to just under the official definition of highly enriched
uranium, but well above the level of the uranium fuel used in currently
operating nuclear power plants.

In enrichment terms, it is [within[ easy arm's
reach](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/09/science/09enrich.html) of
bomb-grade uranium.]{.underline} It is [exactly the stuff we demand that
Iran not produce, arguing that they don't need it for power reactor
fuel]{.underline}. It's [also what we've been discouraging South Korea
from getting into]{.underline} (Seoul says it wants to enrich uranium to
boost reactor exports and
to[[ power]{.underline}](https://thebulletin.org/2020/11/south-koreas-risky-quest-to-build-nuclear-powered-attack-submarines/) a
fleet of nuclear submarines).

Note TerraPower only commits to using HALEU for its first, and likely
subsidized, commercial plants. Whether using HALEU is the cheapest way
of running Natrium is unclear. [Foreign customers---if it ever comes to
that---will surely want the "benefits" of the plant's plutonium
production and subsequent operation on plutonium fuel extracted by
reprocessing.]{.underline} The Energy Department is
already[[ hedging]{.underline}](https://arpa-e-foa.energy.gov/FileContent.aspx?FileID=a02cd89d-cca8-4218-9666-542ff93088f3) its
bets on this option by backing research into "new' reprocessing
technologies at its national laboratories.  

All this will be [hard to explain to, say, South Korea, which the State
Department is trying to keep from launching into reprocessing to prepare
for plutonium-fueled fast reactors]{.underline}, which [South Korean
nuclear enthusiasts are eager to develop.]{.underline} It also will make
it [difficult to complain about China's [crash fast
reactor](https://nationalinterest.org/feature/how-france-fueling-japan-china%E2%80%99s-nuclear-race-14271) and
reprocessing programs, which our
military[ fears](https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/20/politics/china-russia-nuclear-weapons/index.html) may
be used to fuel China's growing nuclear weapons effort.]{.underline}

Fast reactor boosters are aware of these points and know that they must
at least appear to take account of them. An example is Senator Chris Van
Hollen's
(D-MD)[[ amendment]{.underline}](https://www.vanhollen.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Van%20Hollen%20Revised%20Amendment%201.pdf) to
the American Nuclear Infrastructure Act of 2020, which purportedly
protects the nuclear explosives (plutonium and uranium 233) these
reactors use as fuel or produce, and the reprocessing technologies that
extract them. While his amendment may sound tough, it offers little more
protection than what is[[ already
required]{.underline}](https://www.nrc.gov/docs/ML1019/ML101900297.pdf) by
the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and that protection can be waived if
the NRC finds the export is not "inimical" to US interests. The
[practical effect of the amendment would not be greater protection, but
a smoothing of the licensing path for dangerous nuclear
exports. ]{.underline}

This is [worse than hypocrisy]{.underline}. Once [nations have easy
access to nuclear explosive material, no inspections can prevent them
from making bombs]{.underline}. Congress [needs to look behind the
Energy Department's beguiling "advanced reactor" label]{.underline}.
When it does, it [must line out projects that could turn nuclear
explosives into a common article of commerce worldwide. The place to
start is with "advanced" fast reactors.]{.underline}

Would Nuclear Weapons Improve South Korean Security? [Even if the
alliance problems were as profound as some analysts contend --- and if
South Korean nuclear [proliferation]{.mark} did not somehow make them
worse --- a South Korean decision to acquire nuclear weapons [would
not]{.mark} necessarily [improve]{.mark} Seoul's [security against North
Korea or China]{.mark}]{.underline}, as advocates have claimed. Indeed,
a lot would depend on how North Korea and China would react to South
Korean proliferation. South Korean nuclear weapons may not be especially
useful politico-military tools against China. [U.S. [nuclear
threats]{.mark} against China during the Korean War [did not dissuade
Beijing from continuing to fight]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Nor has China
hesitated to leverage its conventional military strength in territorial
contests with nuclear-armed India.]{.underline} China's ongoing
modernization of its nuclear forces --- whether by constructing missile
silos or testing hypersonics --- suggests Beijing may view the
survivability and effectiveness of its arsenal as vital for deterring
the United States, especially in the Taiwan Strait. Would South Korean
nuclear weapons dissuade Beijing from undertaking coercive operations
against Seoul? It seems unlikely. If anything, [South Korean
proliferation could plausibly [invite]{.mark} more **[coercive]{.mark}
Chinese economic and [military pressures]{.mark}** if Beijing
[interpreted Seoul's]{.mark} nuclear [arsenal]{.mark} [as]{.mark} a
[direct challenge]{.mark} to its regional aspirations. Vis-à-vis China,
then, South Korea could wind up counterintuitively less secure with
nuclear weapons than without them.]{.underline} South Korean nuclear
weapons [could similarly [make]{.mark} the [situation]{.mark}
[with]{.mark} [North Korea]{.mark} much [more
dangerous]{.mark}]{.underline}. Already, joint [U.S.-South Korean
military exercises]{.underline}, which Pyongyang calls "exercises for a
nuclear war," [have repeatedly prompted North Korea to issue aggressive
rhetoric]{.underline}, [engage in cross-border provocations, and conduct
missile tests. In the face of a South Korean nuclear weapons program, it
would be unreasonable to expect North Korea to take no countervailing
actions. For example, it seems likely that South Korean
[proliferation]{.mark} could [cause N**orth Korea to further augment**
its]{.mark} nuclear [arsenal]{.mark}, [posture]{.mark} its nuclear
[weapons for first use]{.mark}, or [take]{.mark} [greater risks]{.mark}
to gain the upper hand [in an escalating military crisis]{.mark}. After
all, even the United States, with its far superior nuclear arsenal, has
had limited success deterring or compelling North Korea.]{.underline}
Moreover, [even if South Korean nuclear weapons likely would deter
large-scale violence by China or North Korea, they could make the
[threat of low-level conflict escalation greater]{.mark} than it already
is today]{.underline}. This is especially important in the Indo-Pacific
context, where the most prevalent threats and sources of crisis
escalation --- such as China's overflights of contested territory or
[North Korea's offensive use of [**cyber**
capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline} [--- exist far below the nuclear
threshold]{.underline}. The "stability-instability paradox" of nuclear
weapons suggests that, although mutual possession of nuclear weapons may
reduce the chances of nuclear war, it may, at the same time, make
conventional wars and militarized crises more likely, as well as
[incentivize greater risk taking at lower levels]{.underline}. A more
moderated version of this argument suggests that nuclear weapons may not
necessarily make low-level conflict more likely, but neither do they
prevent it. For instance, a [[nuclear-armed South Korea could be
emboldened to respond]{.mark} more [aggressively to]{.mark} North Korean
[provocations]{.mark} with proactive deterrence or "quid pro quo plus"
military operations,]{.underline} the inherent escalation risks of which
are intended to dissuade North Korea in the first place. [Facing
perceived "use or lose" pressures, North Korea may be quicker to cross
certain **escalation** thresholds, such as the use of long-range rocket
systems, as it seeks escalation dominance]{.underline}. T[he potential
for these action-reaction dynamics]{.underline} to spiral into a race up
the escalation ladder is clear. To be certain, this potential is already
present, but it seems [likely to worsen if South Korea possessed nuclear
weapons]{.underline}. [[Reaction times]{.mark} during moments of crisis
[would be shorter]{.mark}, [tensions higher; **miscommunication** and
misperception easier]{.mark}, and nuclear use more
accessible.]{.underline} South Korean proliferation could, then, [make
conflict more likely at worst and fail to deter it at best.]{.underline}

#### Korean war draws in China, Russia, and Japan 

Medea **Benjamin 17**, M.A. from Columbia, Co-Founder of Global Exchange

Reset Button on US-Korean Policy", Common Dreams,

The United States has also long held a "pre-emptive first strike" policy
towards North Korea. This frightening [threat of an **unprovoked US
nuclear attack** gives North Korea good reason to want its own nuclear
arsenal]{.underline}. North Korea's leadership also looks at the fate of
Iraq's Saddam Hussein and Libya's Muammar Gaddafi, leaders who gave up
their nuclear programs, and conclude that nuclear weapons are their key
to survival. So [the North Korean leadership is not acting
irrationally]{.underline}; on the contrary. On July 29, the day after
the test, North Korean President Kim Jong-un asserted that the threat of
sanctions or military action "only strengthens our resolve and further
justifies our possession of nuclear weapons." Given the proximity of
North Korea to the South's capital Seoul, a city of 25 million people,
[any outbreak of hostilities would be devastating]{.underline}. It is
estimated that a North Korean attack with just conventional weapons
would kill 64,000 South Koreans in the first three hours. A [[war
on]{.mark} the [Korea]{.mark}n Peninsula [would]{.mark}]{.underline}
likely [**[draw in other nuclear]{.mark} armed [states and major
powers]{.mark}**, including [**China, Russia and Japan**. This
region]{.mark}]{.underline} also [[has the **largest militaries and
economies in the world**]{.mark}, the world's busiest commercial ports,
and [half the world's population]{.mark}]{.underline}. Trump has few
options. His Defense Secretary Jim [Mattis has warned]{.underline} that
[[a]{.underline}]{.mark} pre-emptive [[strike]{.mark} on the North's
nuclear and missile capabilities [could **reignite the Korean
War**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Trump had hoped that Chinese President Xi
Jinping could successfully rein in Kim Jong-un, but the Chinese are more
concerned about the collapse of North Korea's government and the chaos
that would ensue. They are also furious about the deployment of THAAD in
South Korea, convinced that its radar can penetrate deep into Chinese
territory. But the Chinese do have another proposal: a freeze for a
freeze. This means a freeze on North Korean missile and nuclear tests in
exchange for a halt on US-South Korean war games. The massive war games
have been taking place every year in March, with smaller ones scheduled
for August. A halt would alleviate tensions and pave the way for
negotiations. So would halting the deployment of the destabilizing THAAD
system so disliked by South Korean villagers, North Koreans and the
Chinese. [[Given the specter of **nuclear war**, the
rational]{.underline}]{.mark} alternative [[policy is]{.mark} one of
**[de-escalation]{.mark}**]{.underline} and engagement. President Moon
has called for dialogue with the North and a peace treaty to permanently
end the Korean War. North Korean diplomats have raised the possibility
of a "freeze for a freeze." Time has proven that coercion doesn't work.
There's an urgent need to hit the reset button on US-Korean policy,
before one of the players hits a much more catastrophic button that
could lead us into a nuclear nightmare.

### 2NC -- Water

[One-fifth of the global population faces a high baseline water stress,
including the Middle East and North Africa]{.underline}. The World Bank
declared the latter as a [**[global
hotspot](https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/water/publication/beyond-scarcity-water-security-in-the-middle-east-and-north-africa) of

the [[most water-stressed city
globally]{.underline}](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378014000880#tbl0010),
is among the capitals of 17 countries facing extreme water stress
conditions. 

[Even countries with low-medium water stress, such as the US, have
certain states with extreme water stress]{.underline}. A recent study
revealed
that [**[61.8%](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/climate-change-poses-big-water-risks-for-nuclear-fossil-fueled-plants-60669992) **or
a combined 535 GW of operating capacity in the US fossil fuel and
nuclear power plants **face medium-high to extremely-high water stress
in 2030.  **]{.underline}

[Climate-induced water crises may **impede achieving decarbonisation**
goals]{.underline}, and therein lies its link with nuclear power
generation. Climate change [catalyses the water crisis, also impacting
global sea and ocean temperatures]{.underline}. Based on these changes,
weather events can [compromise the performance and efficiency of nuclear
power plants. ]{.underline}

This change is evident in Japan's annual temperatures, which have
risen [[faster than the global
average]{.underline}](https://www.env.go.jp/earth/tekiou/pamph2018_full_Eng.pdf).
2021 saw Japan's [[earliest cherry blossom
season]{.underline}](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-56574142) on
record since 812, likely due to climate change. [Nuclear power plants
need large amounts of water for cooling]{.underline}. Still, Japan and
areas of the Mediterranean face [[heating up of their seas and
oceans]{.underline}](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4100510/).
[Sweden, Finland and South Korea have had to face [temporary
closure ](https://www.powermag.com/intense-summer-heatwaves-rattle-worlds-power-plants/)of
their nuclear power plants due to seawater being too
warm.  ]{.underline}

At [**161 billion gallons a day**, the US nuclear and fossil fuel plants
already
consume [45%](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-12133-9) of the
country's freshwater usage]{.underline}. Although nuclear power
generation emits a lower level of carbon dioxide emissions than other
methods, it also [impacts limited freshwater supplies in ways yet to be
thoroughly researched]{.underline}. As discussed earlier, the same
[**water temperature, so very crucial in nuclear power** plant
operations, is rising due to climate-induced changes.   ]{.underline}

A [high opportunity cost is associated with building nuclear power
plants.]{.underline} Economic planning not only factors in the carbon
footprint, but also the time and cost it takes to start delivering the
promised results. Between 1981 and 2019, the [average construction time
of nuclear power plants was between [7 and 9.7
years](https://www.statista.com/statistics/712841/median-construction-time-for-reactors-since-1981/)]{.underline},
with the longest taking 10 years.

[SMRs or Small and Medium Reactors]{.underline} (units ranging from 225
down to 45 MWe) that use less water for cooling and need less
commissioning time may prove to be a better alternative to the
traditional time and cost-intensive nuclear power reactors. However,
[examples of SMRs meeting the energy demand are far and
few.]{.underline} Russia started a [[70MW floating nuclear power
plant]{.underline}](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-49446235) in
2019, which sailed 3,000 miles from the Arctic port of Murmansk to
Chukotka in the far east. Other countries,
including [[China]{.underline}](https://www.powermag.com/china-starts-building-smr-based-floating-nuclear-plant/), [[Canada]{.underline}](https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.news.ontario.ca/opo/en/learnmore/premier_ford_premier_higgs_and_premier_moe_sign_agreement_on_the_development_of_small_modular_reacto/2019%2011%2027%20-%20MOU%20Prov%20NB%20and%20ON%20and%20SK.pdf) and [[France]{.underline}](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-edf-nuclearpower-smr-idUSKBN1W21JM),
are also starting to commission SMRs.

There's also hope in the form of emerging technologies, such as
high-temperature [gas-cooled nuclear reactors (Generation
IV).]{.underline} These reactors could support co-generation and
tri-generation plant configurations that enable multiple products to be
created, namely power, hydrogen, and desalination. Though at a [smaller
scale than traditional nuclear power plants, storage of radioactive
waste and water contamination remains core issues associated with
SMRs]{.underline}. The technology is [still in the early development
phase]{.underline}. NuScale, an SMR development firm, announced in
August 2020 that its first SMR design was approved by the [[US Nuclear
Regulatory
Commission,]{.underline}](https://newsroom.nuscalepower.com/press-releases/news-details/2020/NuScale-Power-Makes-History-as-the-First-Ever-Small-Modular-Reactor-to-Receive-U.S.-Nuclear-Regulatory-Commission-Design-Approval/default.aspx) indicating
the fact that there is still time to realise safety benefits of new
technologies in the nuclear energy sector.  

There are also **[prohibitive aspects of nuclear power]{.underline}**.
Despite countries such as France and Japan keeping nuclear as a
significant part of their energy mix to hit their 2050 emissions
targets, experts argue that [the time and cost it takes to build nuclear
power plants make it a 'prohibitive technology']{.underline}. In America
alone, [more than half of the nuclear power plants are losing money,

We live in an age of great anxiety about [[threats to]{.mark} **global
[peace]{.mark}** [and stability.]{.mark} Among these
[are]{.mark}]{.underline} worries that [intense [water]{.mark}-related
[stresses]{.mark}]{.underline}, now [showing up in regions around the
world]{.underline}, may become all-too-common sources of conflict. Just
as often, however, concerns about water wars are dismissed as much ado
about nothing. An influential school of thought has long contended
future international conflicts will not be fought over this resource.
Water, it says, is of such elemental importance to human existence that
even long-time adversaries will be forced to accommodate one another's
needs in a water-scarce future. As water is too expensive to transport
over long distances, moreover, it is very difficult to steal or plunder.
And history gives some comfort to this forecast: as few wars have been
fought specifically over water, it is highly unlikely humanity will
start engaging in water conflicts now. Or so the thinking goes.

[In the case of water]{.underline}, this [logic --- of [the past as
predictor of the future --- is]{.mark} compelling and comforting.
But]{.underline} it also is [**dangerously [myopic]{.mark}**, for it
[fails to consider]{.mark}]{.underline} the [possibility]{.underline}
that [the future]{.underline} may [look nothing]{.underline} at all
[like the past]{.underline}. From nearly any standpoint, [the
[world]{.mark} we live in [is]{.mark}]{.underline} a [**fundamentally
[different]{.mark}** place compared with the past]{.underline}. Over
just the last century, for example, the global population has rocketed
upward from roughly two billion to well past seven billion. While
population growth is hardly the only driver of social, economic, and
ecological change at global and regional scale, it has been among the
most important. Nor is this process at an end. Current demographic
projections forecast a global population of at least nine billion by
2050 --- and possibly more.

Water in the Anthropocene:

[[Population growth provides a]{.mark} **fitting [illustration]{.mark}**
[of]{.mark}]{.underline} the [**[rapid]{.mark} pace** of [change]{.mark}
in the modern world]{.underline}. No consequence is more important than
what has been done to nature. Humans have so drastically altered the
Earth that scientists now question whether we remain in the Holocene,
the 12,000-year-old geological epoch during which all of recorded human
history has occurred. Instead, increasingly they speak of the Earth as
having entered a new epoch, the Anthropocene. The basic idea behind the
Anthropocene is that human activity has so thoroughly disrupted the
Earth's core processes (for instance, its nitrogen cycle or sediment
flows) that the planet no longer can be said to function according to
the familiar rhythms of the Holocene. [Human interference]{.underline}
in the Earth's carbon cycle, for example, has [changed the **planet's
[climate]{.mark}**]{.underline} and in the process [altered
**[rainfall]{.mark} patterns**, accelerated [glacial melting]{.mark},
increased [air and sea temperatures]{.mark}, and much else]{.underline}.
Gone is the Holocene's stable climate; here is the Anthropocene's
unstable one.

While there is some debate amongst scientists and others about whether
the Anthropocene will lead to a better or worse future, nearly everyone
involved in the discussion agrees that the Earth of the future will not
resemble its past. From here forward, we face an unfamiliar planet that
will throw our assumptions about nearly everything out the window.

[[No resource]{.underline}]{.mark} stands to be [[more
affected]{.underline}]{.mark} by the arrival of the Anthropocene
[[than]{.mark} **fresh [water]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Finite and
increasingly scarce in many parts of the world, fresh water [remains the
**most [vital]{.mark}** single input [for]{.mark} everything from
[food]{.mark} production, [energy]{.mark} generation]{.underline}, and
manufacturing to [human [health]{.mark}, social [development,
and]{.mark} economic [modernization]{.mark}]{.underline}. Unlike oil,
[water has no substitute, making access to it]{.underline} nothing less
than [a matter of **existential importance**]{.underline} to every
living creature on Earth.

Yet [[despite its]{.mark} **monumental [role]{.mark}**
[in]{.mark}]{.underline} local and [international affairs,
[water]{.mark}]{.underline} ironically [[remains]{.mark} completely
[undervalued]{.mark}]{.underline}, pumped and [[consumed]{.mark}
**virtually [free]{.mark}** [of charge]{.mark}]{.underline} across much
of the world. [We]{.underline} essentially [pump water as we breathe
oxygen]{.underline}; it is a learned reflex, central to our ability to
survive and thrive as a species. Nicknames like "blue gold" and "oil of
the 21st century" attest to the value of fresh water and its importance
to everyday affairs throughout the world.

While every country's water equation is different, [[at a global
scale]{.mark} the **basic [problem]{.mark}** [is]{.mark} that
[demand]{.mark} for water [is]{.mark} [soaring]{.mark} while water
supplies are being squeezed]{.underline}. On the demand side, the
[[challenge results from]{.underline}]{.mark} an inexorable combination
of global economic and population growth combined with [water-use
[inefficiencies]{.mark}]{.underline}. On the supply side, the problem
results not just from exhaustion of the world's stock of fresh water
capital, as is happening to groundwater reservoirs nearly everywhere.
Fresh water supply is also becoming less predictable as climate change
sets in---shifting rainfall and snowfall patterns and increasing
evaporation rates are giving us more frequent droughts and floods.

The upshot is that the arrival of the Anthropocene foreshadows a world
where received wisdom may no longer be a reliable guide to the future.
Water insecurity from drought, excessive groundwater extraction, and
changed seasonal precipitation patterns is affecting --- or soon will
affect --- regions as diverse as the Middle East, South Asia, the
Caribbean, northern China, sub-Saharan Africa, the western United
States, and many more.

Water Geopolitics:

Much as oil shaped the global geopolitics of the 20th century,
[[water]{.mark} has]{.underline} the [power to [reorder
**i**]{.mark}nternational **[r]{.mark}**elations in the current
century]{.underline}. The world's emerging [[water geopolitics are
complicated, as]{.underline}]{.mark} fresh [[water]{.mark} resources are
[**distributed unevenly**]{.mark} across the globe]{.underline}. There
are great water powers, blessed with enormous renewable reserves
(Brazil, Russia, the United States, Canada, and China round out the top
five). But [even within]{.underline} these huge [countries, water
availability is not uniform, with]{.underline} southern Brazil, the
western United States, northern China, and other sub-[regions facing
**intense water stress**]{.underline}.

Far more numerous than the water powers are the water have-nots, a
growing list of countries suffering through a perfect storm of rapid
population growth, resource depletion, poor governance, economic
stagnation, and unsettling climate change impacts, all within the
context of chronic aridity. The most
[[water-fragile]{.underline}]{.mark} among them [are [concentrated in
a]{.mark} **strategically [significant]{.mark}**
[belt]{.mark}]{.underline} stretching [[from]{.mark} North [Africa
across the Middle East and Horn]{.mark} of Africa
[into]{.mark}]{.underline} Central, South, and East
[[Asia]{.underline}]{.mark}. It is in [[these]{.underline}]{.mark}
naturally arid or semi-arid [[countries where]{.mark} water
[scarcity]{.mark} has]{.underline} the [**greatest potential** to
[inflict **serious harm**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Water stress]{.underline} is best [understood as a **precursor to
conflict**]{.underline}. While the environmental security community
generally agrees that water disputes rarely leads to interstate
violence, the same cannot be said of intrastate conflict. Here, at the
subnational level, water disputes and instability can trigger violent
conflict, particularly in situations of existing social, political, or
economic fragility. [[Water stress]{.mark} acts as]{.underline} an
[accelerant, [increasing]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[likelihood of
conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}. Moreover, [water scarcity-fueled
[instability]{.mark}]{.underline} can [[have **dangerous**]{.mark}
**security [implications]{.mark}** [for wider]{.mark} geographic
[regions]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Take Syria as an example. Between 2006 and 2010, the country was hit
hard by drought, which wiped out rural livelihoods for many and caused
significant internal displacement across the country. Internal
displacement in turn helped stir up a pot that boiled over into all-out
civil war in Syria, eventually spreading to Iraq. Over the last two
years, ISIS has viewed water access and control as a primary strategic
objective of their campaign, and has commandeered hydroelectric dams,
irrigation canals, reservoirs, pipelines, and other water infrastructure
to cement territorial gains.

Water has played an important role in Yemen's ongoing collapse. Decades
of mismanagement have left the country --- one of the world's most
water-scarce nations --- with dilapidated water infrastructure, severely
depleted groundwater reserves, and high rates of water-use inefficiency.
Yemen's capital, Sana'a, may become the first capital in the modern
world to functionally run out of water, possibly as soon as 2025.

In Pakistan, meanwhile, runaway population growth and shifting rainfall
patterns threaten its water outlook. With a massive population set to
nearly double in the next 35 years, Pakistan's demand on its very
limited water resources will intensify in a way that is almost
unimaginable. Already, the country is one of the most water scarce on
earth. In a nod to water's importance in shaping the region, many
Pakistani militant groups long hostile to India have supplanted protests
over Indian control of Kashmir with more specific protests over access
to Kashmir's most valuable resource --- water.

Other countries join [Syria, Iraq, Yemen, and Pakistan]{.underline} on
the list of nations [facing]{.underline} a [**similar combinati**on of
water stress and social and political insecurity]{.underline}. They
include conflict-prone countries of geopolitical significance, including
[Iran, Afghanistan, Egypt, Libya, Nigeria, and Somalia]{.underline}.
Even more worrisome, [global heavyweights such as China, India,
and]{.underline} even [the United States face **uncomfortable
futures**]{.underline} given mismatches between forecasted demand for
water and squeezed sources of supply. While there is no reason to
believe that the latter states will suffer from the same forms of
insecurity as those countries in the arc of crisis, neither will they be
exempted from the [**blunt realities** of a water-stressed
world]{.underline}.

American Leadership in the Anthropocene:

In 2012, the U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI)
produced a global water security assessment, a first for the American
intelligence community. Over the coming decade, it said, many countries
would face water stresses that "will risk instability and state failure,
increase regional tensions, and distract them from working with the
United States on important U.S. policy objectives." It listed
water-induced stressors that likely would unsettle these states and
their neighbors, ranging from pressures on food and energy production to
social and political disruption to water scarcity used by terrorists for
leverage.

Yet despite the seriousness of ODNI's assessment, the [[U.S.]{.mark}
government has neither a coherent strategy]{.underline} nor the
appropriate tools [to deal with]{.underline} the [**scope and scale** of
water-related challenges around the world]{.underline}. The [federal
government's [approach to water]{.mark}]{.underline} and water-related
challenges [[is]{.mark} **uncoordinated**,
**[outdated]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and poorly resourced in general. In
foreign policy terms, water receives some attention but, as on the
domestic side, [water receives too little attention]{.underline} and
funding (in fiscal year 2013, the U.S. government spent \$784 million
worldwide on water, about half of which was spent on drinking water and
sanitation). This inertia is understandable to an extent, as water is a
cross-cutting resource that does not fit easily into preexisting policy
boxes.

It is [[hardly]{.mark} an **[original]{.mark} argument** [to call
for]{.mark}]{.underline} greater [[American leadership]{.mark} in
**i**nternational **r**elations]{.underline}. Yet [[in]{.mark} the
**case of [water]{.mark}**]{.underline}, such an [[argument could not be
truer. As the]{.mark} world's **[greatest power]{.mark}**]{.underline}[,
[it is in America's]{.underline}]{.mark} [[interests to
place]{.underline}]{.mark} global [**[water]{.mark} security** [at the
top]{.mark} of its]{.underline} foreign policy [agenda, and]{.underline}
to [forge a leadership role in this arena. [Failing to craft]{.mark} a
**strategic [approach]{.mark}** []{.mark}to]{.underline} the world's
[[looming]{.mark} water [crises]{.mark}]{.underline} will [[expose the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates to]{.underline} foreign and [security
policy [failures]{.mark} abroad]{.underline}. Conversely, seizing the
leadership mantle will benefit the United States immensely and add to
its global reputation over the coming decades.

Despite the rise of China, India, and other actors, [American
leadership]{.underline} will [remain central to the operation of the
global system for **many years to come**]{.underline}, and
[[America's]{.mark} many]{.underline} formal and informal
[[assets]{.underline}]{.mark} will [[give it **unrivaled**]{.mark}
**power and [prestige]{.mark}** []{.mark}across multiple
domains]{.underline}. From a strategic standpoint, the U.S. would reap
material, diplomatic, and reputational rewards if it were to be
perceived as a good-faith actor working to solve the world's water
challenges.

The bottom line is that no one can take much comfort from a sober
assessment of where we are headed. Expecting widespread and serious
water challenges to be solved without conflict and disruption might be a
comforting premise, but it should not and cannot be the end of the
discussion. The Anthropocene awaits. To navigate it unscathed, we must
be bold and imaginative.

The **[most intensive drought]{.underline}** ever recorded in Syria
lasted from 2006 to 2011. [Water scarcity hit households, businesses and
infrastructure, while]{.underline} in the [countryside crops failed,
livestock died, and entire families moved to the country's
cities]{.underline}. The subsequent [[eruption of]{.underline}]{.mark}
civil [[war]{.underline}]{.mark} in 2011 [[led to]{.underline}]{.mark}
as many as half a million [deaths, as well as **massive migration
flows**]{.underline} to neighbouring countries and beyond, [and [untold
misery]{.mark}.]{.underline} Syria's war has been a [**tragic
[illustration]{.mark}** [of the **central, driving
role**]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[water insecurity]{.mark} can [play
in]{.mark} **instability and [conflict]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

This is no surprise. In 2017 alone, [[water]{.mark} was [a **major
factor**]{.mark} in conflict [in]{.mark} **at least [45]{.mark}**
[countries]{.mark}]{.underline}, including Syria. Its importance as a
resource means that [water-related [insecurity]{.mark}]{.underline} can
[**easily [exacerbate]{.mark}** [tensions]{.mark} and friction within
and between countries]{.underline}. It can be [weaponized; [**nefarious
actors**]{.mark} can [gain control]{.mark}]{.underline} of, destroy, or
redirect access to water to meet their objectives by targeting
infrastructure and supplies. Advancements in [[cyber attacks]{.mark} on
critical infrastructure [raise]{.mark} **further [concerns]{.mark}** as
to the security of water]{.underline} systems.

The World Economic Forum's Global Risk Report (GRR) has listed [[water
crises]{.underline}]{.mark} among [the **[top-five risks]{.mark}** in
terms of impact for eight consecutive years]{.underline}. In the most
recent version of the report, it remains nested among a cluster of other
risks that are rated as having both a very high likelihood and a [very
high impact]{.underline}. These [include **extreme weather events**,
**natural disasters**]{.underline}, the failure of **[climate
change]{.underline}** adaptation and mitigation, man-made
[**environmental disasters**, **biodiversity loss**]{.underline} and
[**ecosystem collapse**, **interstate conflict**]{.underline} and large
scale-involuntary migration.

These [[risks]{.underline}]{.mark} are **[increasingly
[interconnected]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Failure to mitigate [climate
change could lead to]{.underline} more [extreme weather events,
ecosystem collapse and]{.underline} a [greater likelihood
of]{.underline} man-made [environmental disasters. [All]{.mark} of
these]{.underline} can [[exacerbate]{.mark} **food and water
[insecurity]{.mark}**[, which]{.mark}]{.underline} in turn can [[lead
to]{.mark} human deprivation, and]{.underline} could [make]{.underline}
these and [other risks like **migration** and **conflict** more likely
in [a]{.mark}]{.underline} negative **[[feedback
loop]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Around two thirds of the world's
population, or 4 billion people, currently live without sufficient
access to fresh water for at least one month of the year.

Further [complicating the picture is]{.underline} the
[reality]{.underline} that [[securing water]{.underline}]{.mark} for
food and economic activity [will only [become]{.mark} **more
[difficult]{.mark}** []{.mark}over time. As economies
develop]{.underline}, their [**water consumption patterns** shift and
overall [demand rises]{.mark} dramatically]{.underline} to meet the
needs of food production, thirsty manufacturing and other industries,
thermal power plants and households. However, [[water supplies]{.mark}
are]{.underline} often [[damaged by]{.mark} poor
management]{.underline}, pollution and
[[over-consumption]{.underline}]{.mark}, in addition to supply-side
reductions due to climate change impacts and the ecosystem degradation
mentioned above.

Many of these drivers of insecurity can be seen in the Inner Niger Delta
area of Mali, a marshy wetlands along a stretch of the Niger river.
Disruptions to the Delta's waters, for instance through the construction
of two upstream dams, risk destroying fragile ecosystems and further
destabilizing the entire region. Altering downstream flows can
jeopardize traditional economic activities that underpin the viability
of Delta fishing villages, destroying livelihoods and exacerbating
social tensions such as intergenerational friction.

Combined with reductions in available farmland associated with rising
temperatures and desertification, such environmental degradation risks
further fuelling mass migration to the Malian capital Bamako and Europe.
The journey is not a safe one, with criminalised trafficking routes that
pass nearby between the West African coast and the Sahara. The history
of radicalization in the region by extremist groups that have
established themselves in northern Mali further illustrates the
vulnerabilities facing the displaced and disenfranchised. People whose
access to water is limited risk becoming increasingly marginalized, and
a target for recruitment by radical groups. Water is critical to the
region's security.

The Inner Niger Delta illustrates the [critical role]{.underline} that
[[water insecurity]{.underline}]{.mark} can [play in **exacerbating**
other risks, and]{.underline} the [necessity of holistic]{.underline}
policy [approaches]{.underline}. Unfortunately, [water
insecurity]{.underline} is not yet taken seriously enough by all actors,
despite its [**central role** in our economies]{.underline} and in human
lives and livelihoods. In most scenarios, the [true security
threat]{.underline} caused by water insecurity [is]{.underline} not a
'water war', but rather in [its]{.underline} secondary [impact
on]{.underline} associated [human security,]{.underline} that
[which]{.underline} can then [[exacerbate]{.mark} local, regional and
**[international]{.mark} security [threats]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[[It]{.underline}]{.mark} can [[impede]{.underline}]{.mark} or reverse
**[[econ]{.mark}omic development]{.underline}**, and [[prevent]{.mark}
countries from]{.underline} playing their art in [achieving]{.underline}
the [[S]{.mark}ustainable [D]{.mark}evelopment [G]{.mark}oal[s]{.mark}.
It]{.underline} can [also [affect]{.mark}]{.underline} the private
sector, for instance by affecting [**critical parts** of complex [supply
chains.]{.mark} **Robust [solutions]{.mark}**]{.underline} to the water
security challenge [are [critical for]{.mark} everybody]{.underline}
from public policymakers and businesses to the wider public and [[the
international community]{.underline}]{.mark}. A new generation of
public-private partnerships can be part of the solution to such complex
and interrelated risks, responding with urgency and innovation to manage
the 'less for more' challenge of reduced supply and increased demand.

## Quantum Computing Bad

### Quantum Bad\-\--1NC

#### Quantum computing threatens everything.

What is a quantum computer? A quantum computer is a machine that uses
the laws of quantum theory to solve problems made harder by Moore\'s law
(the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles about
every two years). One example is factoring large numbers. Traditional
computers are limited to logical circuits with several tens of
transistors, while the number of transistors in a quantum processor may
be on the order of one to two million. Meaning, these computers will
have exponential power, solving problems that traditional computation
can\'t even identify or create solutions for. [The dangers of a quantum
computer]{.underline} [In the near future, quantum computers will be so
advanced that they will have the capability to simulate very complicated
systems]{.underline}. This could be used for simulations in physics,
aerospace engineering, cybersecurity and much more. [However, once this
computer is built, it has the potential to unravel data encryption
protocols]{.underline}. I[t could also potentially compromise air gaps
due to its ability to scan vast distances for nearby networked devices
or applications that are open.]{.underline} [This means that it can
become even simpler for external hackers]{.underline}. They may already
have access to your computer or computer system via other avenues, like
vulnerabilities in web browsers. [They could find it much easier because
you\'re not locking up all the doors]{.underline}. Quantum computers
point to a radically new understanding of computing. An understanding
that could eventually be used to unlock problems now thought completely
intractable. For now, the field seems ripe with potential. Scientists
working on quantum computing call it one of the most interesting
theoretical tools in artificial intelligence. Think of it as an
incredibly powerful calculator programmed with deep domain expertise.
Quantum computers promise answers to all sorts of mathematical,
scientific and medical questions humans would never have the guts to
tackle otherwise. They promise profound breakthroughs in imaging that
will rival even experimental intracellular MRI scans; they may help
crack wide-ranging databases that are currently unbreakable or they
might pick up scant details like geological signatures warning us about
tsunamis long before they happen. Can quantum computers be reprogrammed?
[Quantum computers can theoretically be programmed to solve any complex
computational problem. But, the act of programming the computer is so
expensive and inflexible that someone would need to program it with all
possible solutions]{.underline}. [Quantum computers threaten
everything]{.underline}. [The worst part is that security experts can\'t
ever say for sure what you can do to protect against their programming
capabilities]{.underline}. They do know, however, that it\'s possible to
reprogram them just as we would with a normal computer. It\'s just that
[the task is so complex and difficult that programming would be such a
high-level security risk, it might as well never exist]{.underline}.
What does this all mean? It means we need to develop some sort of
encryption technology on our smaller devices so not even those who hold
all the world\'s data can see or access it. [Quantum computers work
differently than traditional computers]{.underline}. That gives the
maker of a quantum computer more control than with a conventional
computer. They can do things like reverse time and process large data
with greater speed. The manufacturer will program the machine before
release, which also comes with certain risks. If they change their mind
and reprogram it per client needs, they put themselves at risk for
security breaches. The catch is that the cryptography keys are only
secure if you keep them secret. [The slightest leak --- say a pinhole
camera across the table from something like a quantum computer or a
phone call or email intercepted while being decrypted --- would enable
an adversary to not just unscramble your message but steal your
keys]{.underline}. [The threat made by quantum computing has been
speculated since before it was even technologically feasible to build a
quantum computer]{.underline}. But now that we\'re nearly there, [the
situation might be even more dire than you can imagine]{.underline}.
Current safety standards [As quantum computers allow for more efficient
algorithms, the dangers of hacking increase]{.underline}. Such security
risks have been a top priority at Google. They have high expectations
for what approach they will take to create their future quantum machine.
In the meantime, DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) has
set out grand challenges for computer science with a hefty \$2 million
prize. DARPA\'s goal is to keep U.S. cyber strength relevant amid the
rapid decline in Moore\'s Law and potential loss of global technological
leadership. [**If quantum computers proliferate, they will threaten
everything**]{.underline} --- [not just bank records and medical
documents, but everything]{.underline}. **[They represent a security
leak so fundamental that it could be worse than the
apocalypse]{.underline}**. [The quantum computer poses a possible threat
to the infrastructure of the United States]{.underline}. Yet the
American authorities do not have enough measures in place to stop this
type of danger. One way that they can defend themselves is by inventing
new safety standards that work with the current technologies. [Whenever
quantum computing matures, however, it will present a vigorous
challenge.]{.underline} Computer scientists will need to develop the
protocols and protections necessary to ensure security for this emerging
technology. If these precautions are not taken, [quantum computing could
lead to disastrous outcomes in cyber security]{.underline}. There needs
to be a protocol developed to provide security for quantum computers.
[Hackers will be able to access and disrupt live systems]{.underline},
which calls for an urgent need of advancements in cyber security. These
new systems can\'t just implement existing protection protocols because
they\'re not fully developed yet. [The cost of research and development
is high and the profits once the product is finished are relatively
low]{.underline}. Quantum computing is a hot topic at this moment in
time that will impact society in a way we can\'t even predict if we
don\'t acknowledge its significance now. Most computers today work in
accordance with digital signals. If someone tries to hack the computer,
it will change that digital signal into another form or cancel it out,
which can be easily noticed. However, [quantum computers use quantum
bits for calculations. They are tied together in a way that makes them
so sensitive to changes in information that they are exponentially more
vulnerable to hacks than digital computers]{.underline}. If someone
manages to hack a quantum computer --- though not yet possible --- it
would have serious implications for maintaining our safety standards.
How can companies protect themselves from the threat of quantum
computers? If the leaked NSA documents are to be believed, then [we may
be in for a rude awakening when quantum computers become technologically
feasible]{.underline}. [These machines will be able to perform
calculations in far less time than any conventional computer and render
our current encryptions ineffectual]{.underline}. The leaks claim that
in 30 years, two medium-sized quantum computers would be able to even
break the security of RSA (cryptosystem) --- which is currently set at
2048 bits. [Any business that relies on modern cryptography is at risk
of being hacked in the near future]{.underline}. But what can companies
do to protect themselves? As it turns out, there are some pretty
straightforward solutions which firms can preserve (or improve) security
amid all this hullabaloo with quantum computing. The authors recommend
investing in encryption techniques like Bitcoin, the blockchain and the
TLS (Transport Layer Security). In simple terms, quantum computers
process information differently from today\'s digital computers. This is
because of their ability to have bits which sit in more than one state
simultaneously, meaning they can perform many calculations at a time.
[In a future dominated by quantum computing, all regular computing will
be made virtually obsolete]{.underline}. [Hackers will be able to access
the deepest secrets of companies without needing a
password]{.underline}. To avoid this fate, companies need to embrace
encryption techniques that guard against quantum technology, but they
cannot afford to stop innovating too drastically. [The looming potential
threat of quantum computing should be taken seriously]{.underline}, but
this doesn\'t mean you should panic. The best way to protect yourself is
to plan ahead and think about possible solutions. Incorporating elements
of quantum cryptography may not always be possible for every client
because of the cost. But, it could help secure an important client who
cannot risk future interference in their sensitive operations.

By now, most people have heard that quantum computing is a revolutionary
technology that leverages the bizarre characteristics of quantum
mechanics to solve certain problems faster than regular computers can.
Those problems range from the worlds of mathematics to retail business,
and physics to finance. If we get quantum technology right, the benefits
should lift the entire economy and enhance U.S. competitiveness. [The
promise of quantum computing was first recognized in the 1980s yet
remains unfulfilled]{.underline}. [Quantum computers are exceedingly
difficult to engineer, build and program]{.underline}. As a result,
[they are]{.underline} ~~crippled~~ \[[limited]{.underline}\] [by errors
in the form of noise, faults and loss of quantum coherence, which is
crucial to their operation and yet falls apart before any nontrivial
program has a chance to run to completion]{.underline}. This loss of
coherence (called decoherence), caused by vibrations, temperature
fluctuations, electromagnetic waves and other interactions with the
outside environment, ultimately destroys the exotic quantum properties
of the computer. [Given the current pervasiveness of decoherence and
other errors, contemporary quantum computers are unlikely to return
correct answers for programs of even modest execution time]{.underline}.
While competing technologies and competing architectures are attacking
these problems, [no existing hardware platform can maintain coherence
and provide the robust error correction required for large-scale
computation.]{.underline} [A breakthrough is probably several years
away]{.underline}. The billion-dollar question in the meantime is, how
do we get useful results out of a computer that becomes unusably
unreliable before completing a typical computation? Answers are coming
from intense investigation across a number of fronts, with researchers
in industry, academia and the national laboratories pursuing a variety
of methods for reducing errors. One approach is to guess what an
error-free computation would look like based on the results of
computations with various noise levels. A completely different approach,
hybrid quantum-classical algorithms, runs only the most
performance-critical sections of a program on a quantum computer, with
the bulk of the program running on a more robust classical computer.
These strategies and others are proving to be useful for dealing with
the noisy environment of today's quantum computers. While classical
computers are also affected by various sources of errors, these errors
can be corrected with a modest amount of extra storage and logic.
[Quantum error­ correction schemes do exist but consume such a large
number of qubits]{.underline} (quantum bits) [that relatively few qubits
remain for actual computation]{.underline}. [That reduces the size of
the computing task to a tiny fraction of what could run on defect-­free
hardware]{.underline}. To put in perspective the importance of being
stingy with qubit consumption, today's state-of-the-art, gate-based
quantum computers, which use logic gates analogous to those forming the
digital circuits found in the computer, smartphone or tablet you're
reading this article on, boast a mere 50 qubits. That is just a tiny
fraction of the number of classical bits your device has available to
it, typically hundreds of billions. TAMING DEFECTS TO GET SOMETHING DONE
[The trouble is, quantum mechanics challenges our
intuition]{.underline}. So we struggle to figure out the best algorithms
for performing meaningful tasks. To help overcome these problems, our
team at Los Alamos National Laboratory is developing a method to invent
and optimize algorithms that perform useful tasks on noisy quantum
computers. Algorithms are the lists of operations that tell a computer
to do something, analogous to a cooking recipe. Compared to classical
algorithms, the quantum kind are best kept as short as possible and, we
have found, best tailored to the particular defects and noise regime of
a given hardware device. That enables the algorithm to execute more
processing steps within the constrained time frame before decoherence
reduces the likelihood of a correct result to nearly zero. In our
interdisciplinary work on quantum computing at Los Alamos, funded by the
Laboratory Directed Research and Development program, we are pursuing a
key step in getting algorithms to run effectively. The main idea is to
reduce the number of gates in an attempt to finish execution before
decoherence and other sources of errors have a chance to unacceptably
reduce the likelihood of success. We use machine learning to translate,
or compile, a quantum circuit into an optimally short equivalent that is
specific to a particular quantum computer. Until recently, we have
employed machine-learning methods on classical computers to search for
shortened versions of quantum programs. Now, in a recent breakthrough,
we have devised an approach that uses currently available quantum
computers to compile their own quantum algorithms. That will avoid the
massive computational overhead required to simulate quantum dynamics on
classical computers. Because this approach yields shorter algorithms
than the state of the art, they consequently reduce the effects of
noise. This machine-learning approach can also compensate for errors in
a manner specific to the algorithm and hardware platform. It might find,
for instance, that one qubit is less noisy than another, so the
algorithm preferentially uses better qubits. In that situation, the
machine learning creates a general algorithm to compute the assigned
task on that computer using the fewest computational resources and the
fewest logic gates. Thus optimized, the algorithm can run longer. This
method, which has worked in a limited setting on quantum computers now
available to the public on the cloud, also takes advantage of quantum
computers' superior ability to scale-up algorithms for large problems on
the larger quantum computers envisioned for the future. New work with
quantum algorithms will give both experts and nonexperts the tools to
perform calculations on a quantum computer. Application developers can
begin to take advantage of quantum computing's potential for
accelerating execution speed beyond the limits of conventional
computing. These advances may bring us all several steps closer to
having robust, reliable large-scale quantum computers to solve complex
real-world problems that bring even the fastest classical computers to
their knees.

#### The aff causes a quantum apocalypse.

Put very simply, [quantum computers work completely differently from the
computers developed over the past century]{.underline}. [In theory, they
could eventually become many, many times faster than today\'s
machines]{.underline}. [That means that faced with an incredibly complex
and time-consuming problem]{.underline} - like trying to decrypt data -
[where there are multiple permutations running into the billions, a
normal computer would take many years to break those encryptions, if
ever]{.underline}. [But a future quantum computer, in theory, could do
this in just seconds]{.underline}. Such computers could be able to solve
all sorts of problems for humanity. The UK government is investing in
the National Quantum Computing Centre in Harwell, Oxfordshire, hoping to
revolutionise research in the field. But [there is]{.underline} also [a
dark side. Data thieves A number of countries, including the US, China,
Russia and the UK, are working hard and investing huge sums of money to
develop these super-fast quantum computers with a view to gaining
strategic advantage in the cyber-sphere]{.underline}. [Every day vast
quantities of encrypted data]{.underline} - including yours and mine -
[are being harvested without our permission and stored in data banks,
ready for the day when the data thieves\' quantum computers are powerful
enough to decrypt it]{.underline}. \"[Everything we do over the internet
today]{.underline},\" says Harri Owen, chief strategy officer at the
company PostQuantum, \"from buying things online, banking transactions,
social media interactions, everything we do [is encrypted]{.underline}.
\"[But once a functioning quantum computer appears that will be able to
break that encryption]{.underline}\... [it can almost instantly create
the ability for whoever\'s developed it to clear bank accounts, to
completely shut down government defence systems]{.underline} - Bitcoin
wallets will be drained.\" It\'s a prognosis echoed by Ilyas Khan, chief
executive of the Cambridge and Colorado-based company Quantinuum.
[\"Quantum computers will render useless most existing methods of
encryption,]{.underline}\" he says. \"[They are a threat to our way of
life]{.underline}.\" Quantum-proofing Seriously? [That does sound
completely apocalyptic]{.underline}, so why haven\'t we heard more about
this? The answer is that yes, OK, this would indeed be the case if no
precautions were being taken. \"If we weren\'t doing anything to combat
it then bad things would happen,\" says a Whitehall official who asked
not to be named. In practice, mitigation efforts are already in train
and have been for some years. In the UK, all government data classified
as \"top secret\" is already \"post-quantum\" - that is, using new forms
of encryption which researchers hope will be quantum-proof. Tech giants
like Google, Microsoft, Intel and IBM are working on solutions, as well
as more specialist companies like Quantinuum and Post-Quantum. Most
importantly, there is currently something of a post-quantum cryptography
\"beauty parade\" taking place at the US National Institute for Science
and Technology (NIST) just outside Washington DC. The aim is to
establish a standardised defence strategy that will protect industry,
government, academia and critical national infrastructure against the
perils of the quantum apocalypse. All of this will not be cheap. Quantum
computing is expensive, laborious and generates large amounts of heat.
Developing quantum-safe algorithms is one of the major security
challenges of our time. But experts say the alternative - doing
nothing - is simply not an option.

[WEAPON OF MASS DISRUPTION Quantum Computers are heralded as the next
step in the evolution of data processing]{.underline}. The future of
this technology promises us a tool that can outperform any conventional
system, handling more data and at faster speeds than even the most
powerful of today\'s supercomputers. [However, at the present juncture,
much of the science dedicated to this field is still focused on the
technology\'s ultimate utilization]{.underline}. We know that quantum
computers could manage data at a rate that is remarkable, but exactly
what kind of data processing will they be good for? This uncertainty
raises some interesting questions about the potential impact of such a
theoretically powerful tool. [No encryption existing today would be able
to hide from the processing power of a functioning quantum
computer]{.underline}. Last month, some of the leading names in quantum
technologies gathered at the semi-annual International Conference on
Quantum Technologies in Moscow. Futurism was in attendance and was able
to sit and talk with some of these scientists about how their work is
moving us closer to practical quantum computers, and what impact such
developments will have on society. [One of the most interesting topics
of discussion was initiated by Alexander Lvovsky, Quantum Optics group
leader at the Russian Quantum Center and Professor of Physics at the
University of Calgary in Canada]{.underline}. Speaking at a dinner
engagement, [Lvovsky stated that quantum computers are a tool of
destruction, not creation]{.underline}. [What is it about quantum
computers that would incite such a claim? In the end, it comes down to
one thing, which happens to be one of the most talked about potential
applications for the technology: Breaking modern
cryptography]{.underline}. WITH GREAT POWER\... [Today, all sensitive
digital information sent over the internet is encrypted]{.underline} in
order to protect the privacy of the parties involved. [Already, we have
seen instances where hackers were able to seize this information by
breaking the encryption]{.underline}. [According to Lvovsky, the advent
of the quantum computer will only make that process easier and
faster]{.underline}. [In fact, he asserts that no encryption existing
today would be able to hide from the processing power of a functioning
quantum computer. Medical records, financial information, even the
secrets of governments and military organizations would be free for the
taking]{.underline}---**[meaning that the entire world order could be
threatened by this technology]{.underline}**. [The consensus between
other experts is]{.underline}, essentially, that [Lvovsky isn\'t
wrong]{.underline}. \"In a sense, he\'s right,\" Wenjamin Rosenfeld, a
physics professor at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, stated
in an interview. He continued, \"taking a quantum computer as a
computer, there\'s basically not much you can do with this at the
moment;\" however, he went on to explain that this may soon be changing.
To break this down, there are only two quantum algorithms at the moment,
one to allow a quantum computer to search a database, and the other,
Shor\'s algorithm, which can be used by a quantum computer to break
encryption. Notably, during the conference, Mikhail Lukin, a co-founder
of the Russian Quantum Center and head of the Lukin Group of the Quantum
Optics Laboratory at Harvard University, announced that he had
successfully built and tested a 51-qubit quantum computer\...and he\'s
going to use that computer to launch Shor\'s algorithm. Vladimir
Shalaev, who sits on the International Advisory Board of the Russian
Quantum Center and is a professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering
at Purdue University, takes a more nuanced approach to this question,
saying it is neither a tool of destruction nor creation---it is both:
\"I would disagree with him. I think I would say that any new
breakthrough breeds both evil and good things.\" [Quantum computers may
not be capable of the physical destruction of a nuclear bomb, but their
potential application is the digital equivalent]{.underline}. He evoked
the development of laser technology as an example, saying, \"Lasers
changed our lives with communications, surgery, their use in machinery,
but they are also used in missiles to destroy buildings. But I think
this is life. Nothing comes with only good, there is always bad as well.
So I don\'t think it is just a destructive technology, it could also be
a constructive one.\" There is a great deal of truth to Shalaev\'s
assessment. Nuclear technology was primarily developed as a destructive
tool. After the war, many more positive applications were found,
impacting energy, medicine, and agriculture, among many other fields.
Quantum computers may not be capable of the physical destruction of a
nuclear bomb, but their potential application in relation to encryption
is the digital equivalent, making this topic worthy of reflection in
these early stages. WHAT GOOD MAY COME? So, if quantum computers do have
such dangerous potential, why are we pursuing them? As Lukin expounds,
there are other potential applications outside of encryption breaking,
applications that many experts are excited about. For example, Lukin
sees enormous potential in quantum sensors. \"It has the potential to
change the field of medical diagnostics, where some of the tasks which
require huge labs can be performed on the scale of an iPhone. Imagine
the implications for third world countries in parts of the world like
Africa. It can really allow to diagnose and treat patients. I think
there's actually a huge impact on society,\" he explained. Also, the
processing power of quantum computers could push research in artificial
intelligence (AI) forward by leaps and bounds. Indeed, it could assist
this field to such a degree that AI could be a part of the answer to the
problem proposed by Lvovsky. To that end, Lukins asserts, \"I'm fairly
convinced that, before quantum computers start breaking encryption, we
will have new classical encryption, we will have new schemes based on
quantum computers, based on quantum cryptography, which will be
operational.\" Much like lasers or nuclear weapons, the scientists
involved in creating quantum computers are unable to predict the total
utility of this technology. There very well could be a host of world
changing applications for quantum computers. Still, even with just
considering the encryption busting potential of the technology, we must
remain cognizant of the power we are unleashing.

#### Quantum tech devastates national security.

What can this mean for national security? With uses ranging from
code-breaking to code-making, and imaging to navigation, [quantum
information science has clear military and intelligence
applications]{.underline}. Moreover, [with developed countries such as
the United States, China, Russia, Austria, Australia, Canada, the United
Kingdom, and commercial companies around the globe investing in quantum
research, these defense applications could have significant impact on
relative national
security]{.underline}.[^[30]{.underline}^](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/public-sector/the-impact-of-quantum-technology-on-national-security.html#endnote-30)
Government leaders, even those in nontechnical positions, should have a
basic understanding of quantum systems and the emerging national
security challenges so they can take steps to protect information and
prepare their organizations, teams, and business practices for the
quantum world. Here are some problem areas in national security matters
where quantum science can be applied. [Loss of secrets Information
security is one of the most fundamental elements of national
security]{.underline}. [Whether it be military plans, advanced
technology information, diplomatic cables, personal data, or company
data, critical details related to state and business security are
embedded in data being shared through public and private
networks]{.underline}. [If we can't protect this data, we can't expect
any reasonable sense of national security]{.underline}. Cryptography is
one way in which governments and private companies secure information.
Often, by utilizing highly complex math problems, cryptography can make
digital information more or less unusable, unless the party concerned
possesses the mathematical solution, known as a key. To decode
cryptography without the key would require completing so many
computations that it is unfeasible for today's computers, but not for
quantum
computers.[^[31]{.underline}^](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/public-sector/the-impact-of-quantum-technology-on-national-security.html#endnote-31)
[Quantum computers will someday be able to compute complex problems so
quickly that some forms of encryption can be broken relatively
easily]{.underline}. For even the largest classical computers yet to be
built, these problems with sufficiently large crypto keys can take
millions of years to solve. However, because of quantum superposition
and entanglement, even a relatively slow quantum computer could break
the encryption in a matter of hours (assuming an RSA cryptokey of 2,048
bits, a hypothetical 1-petahertz classical computer and a hypothetical
1-megahertz quantum
computer).[^[32]{.underline}^](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/public-sector/the-impact-of-quantum-technology-on-national-security.html#endnote-32)
[This poses a significant problem for not just governments trying to
protect state secrets but also for commercial companies responsible for
protecting personal data]{.underline}. The seriousness of the issue
seems to become only more apparent when you consider the fact that
information can be downloaded today and decrypted later once quantum
computers are
mature.[^[33]{.underline}^](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/public-sector/the-impact-of-quantum-technology-on-national-security.html#endnote-33)
Luckily, not all types of encryption can be decoded easily by quantum
computers. Many of government's most sensitive secrets are protected by
symmetric encryption immune to quantum attacks, and mathematicians and
cryptographers are working on improved "quantum-resistant" algorithms
that can be used for everyday uses such as telecommunications. But
relying on mathematicians to develop quantum-resistant encryption is not
the sole answer. In fact, it may actually be the easy part. In the words
of Kania, "the tricky aspect will be implementation. [The transition
required in updating to new, post-quantum cryptography can be extremely
difficult, especially for defense and national security organizations
that tend to have a significant proportion of legacy
systems]{.underline}."[^[34]{.underline}^](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/public-sector/the-impact-of-quantum-technology-on-national-security.html#endnote-34)
[Even once new algorithms are developed, the arduous process of updating
keys and adding software patches can take years, if the process is
possible at all]{.underline}. Add on top of this the regulatory and
technological requirements to continue to support existing types of
security, and organizations can face the challenge of having to
interweave existing and post-quantum security measures on the same
systems. As David Worrall of Cambridge Quantum Computing describes it,
[post-quantum security "is not a 'drop-in' replacement for existing
measures; it likely must lay on top of existing infrastructure, updating
key generation, hardware security models, and algorithms to provide
additional
security]{.underline}."[^[35]{.underline}^](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/public-sector/the-impact-of-quantum-technology-on-national-security.html#endnote-35)
This may be good news for governments looking to avoid ripping and
replacing costly IT infrastructure, but it also means that government
leaders need to have a detailed understanding of their data, security
needs, and network architecture in order to find the right mix of
classical, quantum, and post-quantum security methods. As Dowling puts
it, "There is not one simple fix, but a menu of options where price,
security, and data transmission distance cannot all be simultaneously
optimized. The state of quantum technology is still in flux right now,
and this menu will change
yearly."[^[36]{.underline}^](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/public-sector/the-impact-of-quantum-technology-on-national-security.html#endnote-36)

#### Nuke war won't cause extinction\-\--BUT, it'll spur [political will]{.underline} for [meaningful disarmament]{.underline}.

Although nuclear war is the oldest of these technogenic threats to
civilization and human survival, and although important steps to
restraint, particularly at the end of the Cold War, have been achieved,
[the nuclear world is increasingly changing in major ways, and in almost
**entirely dangerous directions**]{.underline}. The third "bombs away"
phase of the great debate on the nuclear-political question is more
consequentially divided than in the first two phases. [Even more
ominously, most of the momentum lies with the forces that are pulling
states **toward nuclear-use**, and with the radical actors bent on
inflicting catastrophic damage on the leading states in the
international system, particularly the United States]{.underline}. [In
contrast, the arms control project, although intellectually vibrant, is
**largely in retreat** on the world political stage. The arms control
settlement of the Cold War is **unraveling**]{.underline}, and the world
public is more divided and distracted than ever. [With the recent
election of]{.underline} President Donald [**Trump**, the United States,
which has played such a dominant role in nuclear politics since its
scientists invented these fiendish engines, now has an **impulsive and
uninformed leader**, boding **ill for nuclear restraint and effective
crisis management**.]{.underline} Given current trends, it is prudent to
assume that **[[sooner or late]{.mark}r]{.underline}**[,]{.mark} and
probably sooner, [**[nuclear weapons will again be the used in
war]{.mark}**. But this bad news may contain a **"silver lining" of good
news**[. Unlike a **general** nuclear war]{.mark}]{.underline} that
might have occurred during the Cold War, such [a [nuclear event now
would]{.mark}]{.underline} probably **[[not mark the end of]{.mark}
civilization (or]{.underline}** of [[**humanity**), due
to]{.underline}]{.mark} the great [**[reductions in nuclear
forces]{.underline}** [achieved at the end of the Cold
War]{.underline}]{.mark}[. Furthermore, **politics**]{.underline} [on
"the day after" could have **immense potential for positive change**.
The survivors would not be likely to envy the dead, but would surely
have a **greatly renewed resolution for "never again."**]{.underline}
[[Such an event]{.mark}, completely unpredictable in its particulars,
[would **unambiguously put the nuclear-political question back at the
top of the world political agend**]{.mark}**a**. It [would unmistakeably
remind leading states of their **vulnerability**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[It might also [trigger more robust efforts to achieve]{.mark} the
**[global regulation of nuclear capability]{.mark}**. Like the bombings
of Hiroshima and Nagasaki that did so much to catalyze the elevated
concern for nuclear security in the early Cold War, and like the
experience "at the brink" in the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, **the now

[**Imagine that the world as we know it ends tomorrow**. There's a
**global catastrophe**]{.underline}: a pandemic virus, an asteroid
strike, or [perhaps a **nuclear holocaust**]{.underline}. [The **vast
majority** of the human race **perishes**. Our civilisation collapses.
The post-apocalyptic survivors find themselves in a devastated world of
decaying, deserted cities]{.underline} and roving gangs of bandits
looting and taking by force. **[Bad as things sound, that's not the end
for humanity]{.underline}**. [We]{.underline} **[bounce
back]{.underline}**. Sooner or later, **[peace and order]{.underline}**
[emerge again, just as they have time and again through history.
**Stable communities** take shape]{.underline}. [They]{.underline}
[begin]{.underline} the agonising process of
**[rebuilding]{.underline}** their technological base from scratch. [But
here's the question: how far could such a society rebuild? [Is there
**any chance**]{.mark}]{.underline}, for instance, [that [a
post-apocalyptic society could **reboot a technological
civilisation?**]{.mark}]{.underline} Let's make the basis of this
thought experiment a little more specific. Today, [[we have already
consumed the **most** easily drainable **crude oil**]{.mark}
and]{.underline}, particularly in Britain, much of the shallowest,
[**most** readily mined deposits of **coal**]{.underline}. [**[Fossil
fuels are central]{.underline}** [to]{.underline}]{.mark} [the
[organisation of modern]{.mark} industrial [society]{.mark}, just as
they were central to its **development**]{.underline}.
[Those]{.underline}, by the way, [are]{.underline} **[distinct
roles]{.underline}**: [even if we could somehow do without fossil fuels
now (which we can't, quite), it's a different question whether we
**could have got to where we are without ever having had
them**.]{.underline} So, would a society starting over on a planet
stripped of its fossil fuel deposits have the chance to progress through
its own Industrial Revolution? Or to phrase it another way, what might
have happened if, for whatever reason, the Earth had never acquired its
extensive underground deposits of coal and oil in the first place? Would
our progress necessarily have halted in the 18th century, in a
pre-industrial state? [It's easy to **underestimate** our current
dependence on fossil fuels]{.underline}. In everyday life, their most
visible use is the petrol or diesel pumped into the vehicles that fill
our roads, and the coal and natural gas which fire the power stations
that electrify our modern lives. But we also rely on a range of
different industrial materials, and in most cases, high temperatures are
required to transform the stuff we dig out of the ground or harvest from
the landscape into something useful. [[You can't smelt metal, make
glass, roast the ingredients of concrete, or synthesise artificial
fertiliser without]{.mark} a lot of heat. It is **[fossil
fuels]{.mark}** -- coal, gas and oil -- [that provide]{.mark} most of
this [**thermal** energy]{.mark}.]{.underline} I[n fact, the problem is
**even worse** than that. Many of the **chemicals** required in bulk to
run the modern world, from pesticides to plastics, derive from the
**diverse organic compounds in crude oil**]{.underline}. Given the
dwindling reserves of crude oil left in the world, it could be argued
that the most wasteful use for this limited resource is to simply burn
it. We should be carefully preserving what's left for the vital
repertoire of valuable organic compounds it offers. But my topic here is
not what we should do now. Presumably everybody knows that we must
transition to a low-carbon economy one way or another. No, I want to
answer a question whose interest is (let's hope) more theoretical. [Is
the emergence of a technologically advanced civilisation necessarily
contingent on the easy availability of ancient energy?]{.underline} Is
it possible to build an industrialised civilisation without fossil
fuels? And the answer to that question is: maybe -- but it would be
extremely difficult. Let's see how. We'll start with a natural thought.
Many of our alternative energy technologies are already highly
developed. Solar panels, for example, represent a good option today, and
are appearing more and more on the roofs of houses and businesses. It's
tempting to think that a rebooted society could simply pick up where we
leave off. [Why couldn't our civilisation 2.0 just start with
renewables? Well, it could, in a very limited way. If you find yourself
among the survivors in a post-apocalyptic world, you could
**scavenge**]{.underline} enough **[working solar panels]{.underline}**
to keep your lifestyle electrified for a good long while. Without moving
parts, photovoltaic cells require little maintenance and are remarkably
resilient. They do deteriorate over time, though, from moisture
penetrating the casing and from sunlight itself degrading the
high-purity silicon layers. The electricity generated by a solar panel
declines by about 1 per cent every year so, after a few generations, all
our hand-me-down solar panels will have degraded to the point of
uselessness. **[Then what? New ones]{.underline}** [would be
**fiendishly difficult**]{.underline} to create from scratch. [Solar
panels are]{.underline} made from thin slices of
**[extremely]{.underline}** pure silicon, and although the raw material
is common sand, it must be processed and refined using
**[complex]{.underline}** and precise techniques -- the same
technological capabilities, more or less, that we need for modern
semiconductor electronics components. [These techniques took a long time
to develop, and would presumably take a long time to recover. So
photovoltaic solar power would not be within the capability of a society
early in the industrialisation process.]{.underline} Perhaps, though, we
were on the right track by starting with electrical power. Most of our
renewable-energy technologies produce electricity. In our own historical
development, it so happens that the core phenomena of electricity were
discovered in the first half of the 1800s, well after the early
development of steam engines. Heavy industry was already committed to
combustion-based machinery, and electricity has largely assumed a
subsidiary role in the organisation of our economies ever since. But
could that sequence have run the other way? Is there some developmental
requirement that thermal energy must come first? On the face of it, it's
not beyond the bounds of possibility that a progressing society could
construct electrical generators and couple them to simple windmills and
waterwheels, later progressing to wind turbines and hydroelectric dams.
[[In a world without fossil fuels, one might envisage an electrified
civilisation that largely **bypasses combustion**]{.underline}]{.mark}
engines, building its transport infrastructure around electric trains
and trams for long-distance and urban transport. [I say 'largely'. We
couldn't get round it all together. When it comes to generating the
white heat demanded by modern industry, there are **few good options but
to burn stuff**]{.underline} While the electric motor could perhaps
replace the coal-burning steam engine for mechanical applications,
society, as we've already seen, also relies upon thermal energy to drive
the essential chemical and physical transformations it needs. How could
an industrialising society produce crucial building materials such as
iron and steel, brick, mortar, cement and glass without resorting to
deposits of coal? You can of course create heat from electricity. We
already use electric ovens and kilns. Modern arc furnaces are used for
producing cast iron or recycling steel. The problem isn't so much that
electricity can't be used to heat things, but that for meaningful
industrial activity you've got to generate prodigious amounts of it,
which is challenging using only renewable energy sources such as wind
and water. An alternative is to generate high temperatures using solar
power directly. Rather than relying on photovoltaic panels, concentrated
solar thermal farms use giant mirrors to focus the sun's rays onto a
small spot. The heat concentrated in this way can be exploited to drive
certain chemical or industrial processes, or else to raise steam and
drive a generator. Even so, it is difficult (for example) to produce the
very high temperatures inside an iron-smelting blast furnace using such
a system. What's more, it goes without saying that the effectiveness of
concentrated solar power depends strongly on the local climate. No, when
it comes to generating the white heat demanded by modern industry, there
are few good options but to burn stuff. But that doesn't mean the stuff
we burn necessarily has to be fossil fuels. Let's take a quick detour
into the pre-history of modern industry. Long before the adoption of
coal, charcoal was widely used for smelting metals. In many respects it
is superior: charcoal burns hotter than coal and contains far fewer
impurities. In fact, coal's impurities were a major delaying factor on
the Industrial Revolution. Released during combustion, they can taint
the product being heated. During smelting, sulphur contaminants can soak
into the molten iron, making the metal brittle and unsafe to use. It
took a long time to work out how to treat coal to make it useful for
many industrial applications. And, in the meantime, charcoal worked
perfectly well. And then, well, we stopped using it. In retrospect,
that's a pity. When it comes from a sustainable source, charcoal burning
is essentially carbon-neutral, because it doesn't release any new carbon
into the atmosphere -- not that this would have been a consideration for
the early industrialists. But charcoal-based industry didn't die out
altogether. In fact, it survived to flourish in Brazil. Because it has
substantial iron deposits but few coalmines, Brazil is the largest
charcoal producer in the world and the ninth biggest steel producer. We
aren't talking about a cottage industry here, and this makes Brazil a
very encouraging example for our thought experiment. The trees used in
Brazil's charcoal industry are mainly fast-growing eucalyptus,
cultivated specifically for the purpose. The traditional method for
creating charcoal is to pile chopped staves of air-dried timber into a
great dome-shaped mound and then cover it with turf or soil to restrict
airflow as the wood smoulders. The Brazilian enterprise has scaled up
this traditional craft to an industrial operation. Dried timber is
stacked into squat, cylindrical kilns, built of brick or masonry and
arranged in long lines so that they can be easily filled and unloaded in
sequence. The largest sites can sport hundreds of such kilns. Once
filled, their entrances are sealed and a fire is lit from the top. The
skill in charcoal production is to allow just enough air into the
interior of the kiln. There must be enough combustion heat to drive out
moisture and volatiles and to pyrolyse the wood, but not so much that
you are left with nothing but a pile of ashes. The kiln attendant
monitors the state of the burn by carefully watching the smoke seeping
out of the top, opening air holes or sealing with clay as necessary to
regulate the process. Brazil shows how the raw materials of modern
civilisation can be supplied without reliance on fossil fuels Good
things come to those who wait, and this wood pyrolysis process can take
up to a week of carefully controlled smouldering. The same basic method
has been used for millennia. However, the ends to which the fuel is put
are distinctly modern. Brazilian charcoal is trucked out of the forests
to the country's blast furnaces where it is used to transform ore into
pig iron. This pig iron is the basic ingredient of modern mass-produced
steel. The Brazilian product is exported to countries such as China and
the US where it becomes cars and trucks, sinks, bathtubs, and kitchen
appliances. Around two-thirds of Brazilian charcoal comes from
sustainable plantations, and so this modern-day practice has been dubbed
'green steel'. Sadly, the final third is supplied by the non-sustainable
felling of primary forest. Even so, the Brazilian case does provide an
example of how the raw materials of modern civilisation can be supplied
without reliance on fossil fuels. Another, related option might be wood
gasification. The use of wood to provide heat is as old as mankind, and
yet simply burning timber only uses about a third of its energy. The
rest is lost when gases and vapours released by the burning process blow
away in the wind. Under the right conditions, even smoke is combustible.
We don't want to waste it. Better than simple burning, then, is to drive
the thermal breakdown of the wood and collect the gases. You can see the
basic principle at work for yourself just by lighting a match. The
luminous flame isn't actually touching the matchwood: it dances above,
with a clear gap in between. The flame actually feeds on the hot gases
given off as the wood breaks down in the heat, and the gases combust
only once they mix with oxygen from the air. Matches are fascinating
when you look at them closely. Wartime gasifier cars could achieve about
1.5 miles per kilogram. Today's designs improve upon this To release
these gases in a controlled way, bake some timber in a closed container.
Oxygen is restricted so that the wood doesn't simply catch fire. Its
complex molecules decompose through a process known as pyrolysis, and
then the hot carbonised lumps of charcoal at the bottom of the container
react with the breakdown products to produce flammable gases such as
hydrogen and carbon monoxide. The resultant 'producer gas' is a
versatile fuel: it can be stored or piped for use in heating or street
lights, and is also suitable for use in complex machinery such as the
internal combustion engine. More than a million gasifier-powered cars
across the world kept civilian transport running during the oil
shortages of the Second World War. In occupied Denmark, 95 per cent of
all tractors, trucks and fishing boats were powered by wood-gas
generators. The energy content of about 3 kg of wood (depending on its
dryness and density) is equivalent to a litre of petrol, and the fuel
consumption of a gasifier-powered car is given in miles per kilogram of
wood rather than miles per gallon. Wartime gasifier cars could achieve
about 1.5 miles per kilogram. Today's designs improve upon this. But you
can do a lot more with wood gases than just keep your vehicle on the
road. It turns out to be suitable for any of the manufacturing processes
needing heat that we looked at before, such as kilns for lime, cement or
bricks. Wood gas generator units could easily power agricultural or
industrial equipment, or pumps. Sweden and Denmark are world leaders in
their use of sustainable forests and agricultural waste for turning the
steam turbines in power stations. And once the steam has been used in
their 'Combined Heat and Power' (CHP) electricity plants, it is piped to
the surrounding towns and industries to heat them, allowing such CHP
stations to approach 90 per cent energy efficiency. Such plants suggest
a marvellous vision of industry wholly weaned from its dependency on
fossil fuel. Is that our solution, then? [Could our rebooting society
run on **wood**]{.underline}, supplemented with electricity from
renewable sources? [Maybe so, if the **population** was **fairly
small**]{.underline}. [But **here's the catch**. These [options]{.mark}
all [presuppose that our survivors are able to **construct efficient
steam turbines, CHP stations and internal combustion**]{.mark}
**engines**]{.underline}. [We]{.underline} **[know how to
do]{.underline}** all **[that]{.underline}**, [of course -- but [in the
event of a civilisational collapse, **who is to say that the knowledge
won't be lost?**]{.mark} **And if it is, [what are the chances that our
descendants]{.mark} could [reconstruct it?]{.mark}**]{.underline} In our
own history, the first successful application of steam engines was in
pumping out coal mines. This was a setting in which fuel was already
abundant, so it didn't matter that the first, primitive designs were
terribly inefficient. The increased output of coal from the mines was
used to first smelt and then forge more iron. Iron components were used
to construct further steam engines, which were in turn used to pump
mines or drive the blast furnaces at iron foundries. And of course,
steam engines were themselves employed at machine shops to construct yet
more steam engines. It was only once steam engines were being built and
operated that subsequent engineers were able to devise ways to increase
their efficiency and shrink fuel demands. They found ways to reduce
their size and weight, adapting them for applications in transport or
factory machinery. In other words, there was a positive feedback loop at
the very core of the industrial revolution: the production of coal, iron
and steam engines were all mutually supportive. [In a world without
readily mined coal, would there ever be the opportunity to test
profligate prototypes of steam engines, even if they could mature and
become more efficient over time?]{.underline} [How feasible is it that a
society could attain a **sufficient understanding of thermodynamics,
metallurgy and mechanics**]{.underline} [to make the precisely
interacting components of an internal combustion engine, without first
**cutting its teeth** on **much simpler external combustion engines** --
the separate boiler and cylinder-piston of steam engines? It took a lot
of energy to develop our technologies to their present heights, and
presumably it would take a lot of energy to do it again. [Fossil fuels
are out]{.mark}. That means our future society will need an **awful lot
of timber**]{.underline}. An industrial revolution without coal would
be, at a minimum, very difficult In a temperate climate such as the
UK's, an acre of broadleaf trees produces about four to five tonnes of
biomass fuel every year. If you cultivated fast-growing kinds such as
willow or miscanthus grass, you could quadruple that. The trick to
maximising timber production is to employ coppicing -- cultivating trees
such as ash or willow that resprout from their own stump, becoming ready
for harvest again in five to 15 years. This way you can ensure a
sustained supply of timber and not face an energy crisis once you've
deforested your surroundings. But here's the thing: coppicing was
already a well-developed technique in pre-industrial Britain. It
couldn't meet all of the energy requirements of the burgeoning society.
The central problem is that woodland, even when it is well-managed,
competes with other land uses, principally agriculture. The
double-whammy of development is that, [as a society's population grows,
it requires more farmland to provide enough food and **also greater
timber production** for **energy**. The two needs **compete** for
largely the same land areas.]{.underline} We know how this played out
[in **our own past**]{.underline}. From the mid-16th century, [Britain
responded to these factors by **increasing the exploitation of its coal
fields**]{.underline} -- essentially harvesting the energy of ancient
forests beneath the ground without compromising its agricultural output.
The same energy provided by one hectare of coppice for a year is
provided by about five to 10 tonnes of coal, and it can be dug out of
the ground an awful lot quicker than waiting for the woodland to regrow.
[It is this limitation in the supply of thermal energy that would pose
the biggest problem to a society trying to industrialise without easy
access to fossil fuels. [This is true in our **post-apocalyptic
scenario**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and it would be equally true in any
counterfactual world that never developed fossil fuels for whatever
reason. For a society to stand any chance of industrialising under such
conditions, it would have to focus its efforts in certain, very
favourable natural environments: not the coal-island of 18th-century
Britain, but perhaps areas of Scandinavia or Canada that combine
fast-flowing streams for hydroelectric power and large areas of forest
that can be harvested sustainably for thermal energy. Even so, [an
industrial revolution without coal would be, at a minimum, **very
difficult**]{.underline}. Today, use of fossil fuels is actually
growing, which is worrying for a number of reasons too familiar to
rehearse here. Steps towards a low-carbon economy are vital. But we
should also recognise how pivotal those accumulated reservoirs of
thermal energy were in getting us to where we are. Maybe we could have
made it the hard way. A slow-burn progression through the stages of
mechanisation, supported by a combination of renewable electricity and
sustainably grown biomass, might be possible after all. Then again, it
might not. We'd better hope we can secure the future of our own
civilisation, because we might have scuppered the chances of any society
to follow in our wake.

On the other end of the spectrum, the norm could be weaker. The
[Hiroshima and Nagasaki]{.underline} bombings [provided a vivid and
enduring image of the horrors of nuclear war---hence **the norm** can
reasonably be described as a]{.underline} [**legacy of the bombings**.
Without this image, there would be **less to motivate the norm**. [A
weaker norm **could**]{.mark}]{.underline} in turn [[have led to a
nuclear war occurring]{.underline} **[later]{.underline}**]{.mark}[,
especially during a **near-miss event**]{.underline} [like
the]{.underline} [**Cuban missile crisis**. [A later nuclear war
would]{.mark}]{.underline} likely [[be]{.underline} **[much more
severe]{.underline}**]{.mark}[, assuming some]{.underline} significant
[buildup of nuclear **arsenals**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
especially [[if]{.underline} **["overkill" targeting]{.underline}** [was
used]{.underline}]{.mark}[. [A]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[new nuclear
war]{.underline}** [could bring a]{.underline}
**[similar]{.underline}**]{.mark}ly wide range of
**[[shift]{.underline}]{.mark}**s [**[in nuclear weapons
norms]{.mark}**. [It could **strengthen the norm**]{.mark},
[hastening]{.mark}]{.underline} [**nuclear [disarmament]{.mark}**.
Already, there is a political initiative drawing attention to the
**humanitarian consequences** of nuclear weapons use in order to promote
a new treaty to ban nuclear weapons as a step towards complete nuclear
disarmament]{.underline} (Borrie 2014). [It is easy to imagine this
initiative **using any new nuclear attacks to advance their
goals**]{.underline}. Alternatively, it could weaken the norm,
potentially leading to more and/or larger nuclear wars. This is a common
concern, as seen for example in debates over low-yield bunker buster
nuclear weapons (Nelson 2003). [[Given that the impacts of a large
nuclear war could be **extremely severe**, a shift]{.mark} in nuclear
weapons]{.underline} **[norms]{.underline}** [[could]{.mark} easily [be
the **single most consequential effect of a smaller nuclear
war.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Extinction is inevitable from future technology --- nanotech, our simulation gets shut down, AI, biotech, particle accelerators, and black swans

Bruce **Sterling**, 6-1-20**18**, \"When Nick Bostrom says "Bang",\"
WIRED,
https://www.wired.com/beyond-the-beyond/2018/06/nick-bostrom-says-bang/

4.1 [Deliberate **[misuse of nanotech]{.mark}nology**]{.underline}

[In a mature form, molecular nanotechnology will [enable the
construction of]{.mark} bacterium-scale [self-replicating]{.mark}
mechanical [robots]{.mark} that]{.underline} can [feed on dirt or other
organic matter]{.underline} \[22-25\]. [Such replicators could **[eat up
the biosphere]{.mark}** or destroy it]{.underline} by other means such
[as by poisoning it, burning it, or blocking out sunlight. A person of
malicious intent in possession of this technology]{.underline} might
[[cause]{.mark} the [extinction]{.mark} of]{.underline} intelligent
[life on Earth]{.underline} by releasing such nanobots into the
environment.\[9\]

[The [tech]{.mark}nology [to produce a destructive nanobot]{.mark} seems
considerably [easier]{.mark} to develop [than]{.mark} the technology to
create an effective [defense]{.mark} against such an attack]{.underline}
(a global nanotech immune system, an "active shield" \[23\]). It is
therefore likely that [[there will be a period of
vulnerability]{.underline}]{.mark} during which this technology must be
prevented from coming into the wrong hands. Yet [the
technology]{.underline} could [prove [hard to regulate]{.mark}, since it
doesn't require rare radioactive isotopes or large, easily identifiable
manufacturing plants]{.underline}, as does production of nuclear weapons
\[23\].

[Even if effective defenses against a limited nanotech attack are
developed]{.underline} before dangerous replicators are designed and
acquired by suicidal regimes or terrorists, [there will still be the
danger of an arms race between states possessing
[nanotech]{.mark}nology]{.underline}. It has been argued \[26\] that
[molecular manufacturing would [lead to]{.mark} both [arms race
instability]{.mark} and crisis instability]{.underline}, to a higher
degree than was the case with nuclear weapons. Arms race instability
means that [there would be dominant [incentives]{.mark} for each
competitor [to escalate its armaments]{.mark}, leading to a runaway arms
race. Crisis instability means that there would be dominant incentives
for striking first. Two]{.underline} roughly balanced [rivals acquiring
nanotechnology would]{.underline}, on this view, [begin a massive
buildup of armaments and weapons development programs that would
continue until a crisis occurs and war breaks out]{.underline},
potentially [[causing global terminal destruction]{.underline}]{.mark}.
That the arms race could have been predicted is no guarantee that an
international security system will be created ahead of time to prevent
this disaster from happening. The nuclear arms race between the US and
the USSR was predicted but occurred nevertheless.

4.2 Nuclear holocaust\[winter\]

The US and Russia still have huge stockpiles of nuclear weapons. But
would an all-out nuclear war really exterminate humankind? Note that:
(i) For there to be an existential risk it suffices that we can't be
sure that it wouldn't. (ii) The climatic effects of a large nuclear war
are not well known (there is the possibility of a nuclear winter). (iii)
Future arms races between other nations cannot be ruled out and these
could lead to even greater arsenals than those present at the height of
the Cold War. The world's supply of plutonium has been increasing
steadily to about two thousand tons, some ten times as much as remains
tied up in warheads (\[9\], p. 26). (iv) Even if some humans survive the
short-term effects of a nuclear war, it could lead to the collapse of
civilization. A human race living under stone-age conditions may or may
not be more resilient to extinction than other animal species.

4.3 **[[We're living in a simulation and it gets shut
down]{.underline}]{.mark}**

A case can be made that [the [hypothesis]{.mark} that [we are living in
a]{.mark} computer [simulation should be given]{.mark} a [significant
probability]{.mark}]{.underline} \[27\]. The basic idea behind this
so-called "Simulation argument" is that [vast amounts of computing power
may become available in the future]{.underline} (see e.g. \[28,29\]),
[and that it could be used]{.underline}, among other things, [to run
large numbers of fine-grained simulations of past human
civilizations]{.underline}. Under some not-too-implausible assumptions,
[the result can be that [almost all minds]{.mark} like ours [are
simulated]{.mark} minds, and that we should therefore assign a
significant probability to being such computer-emulated minds rather
than the]{.underline} (subjectively indistinguishable) [minds of
originally evolved creatures. And if we are, we suffer the risk that the
simulation may be shut down at any time. A [decision to terminate our
simulation]{.mark}]{.underline} may [be **[prompted by our
actions]{.mark}**]{.underline} or by exogenous factors.

While to some it may seem frivolous to list such a radical or
"philosophical" hypothesis next the concrete threat of nuclear
holocaust, we must seek to base these evaluations on reasons rather than
untutored intuition. Until a refutation appears of the argument
presented in \[27\], it would intellectually dishonest to neglect to
mention simulation-shutdown as a potential extinction mode.

4.4 **[[Badly programmed superintelligence]{.underline}]{.mark}**

[When we create the first superintelligent entity]{.underline}
\[28-34\], [we might make a mistake and give it goals that lead it to
annihilate humankind]{.underline}, assuming its [enormous intellectual
advantage gives it the power to do so]{.underline}. For example, [we
could [mistakenly elevate a subgoal to]{.mark} the status of [a
supergoal]{.mark}. We tell it to [solve a]{.mark} mathematical
[problem]{.mark}, and it complies by [turning all the matter]{.mark} in
the solar system [into a giant calculating device]{.mark}]{.underline},
in the process killing the person who asked the question. (For further
analysis of this, see \[35\].)

4.5 **[[Genetically engineered bio]{.mark}logical
[agent]{.mark}]{.underline}**

[With the]{.underline} fabulous [advances in genetic
technology]{.underline} currently taking place, [it may [become possible
for a tyrant, terrorist]{.mark}]{.underline}, or ~~lunatic~~ [[to create
a doomsday virus]{.underline}]{.mark}, an organism [that **[combines
long latency with high virulence and mortality]{.mark}**]{.underline}
\[36\].

[Dangerous viruses [can]{.mark} even [be spawned
unintentionally]{.mark}]{.underline}, as Australian researchers recently
demonstrated when they created a modified mousepox virus with 100%
mortality while trying to design a contraceptive virus for mice for use
in pest control \[37\]. While this particular virus doesn't affect
humans, it is suspected that an analogous alteration would increase the
mortality of the human smallpox virus. What underscores the future
hazard here is that the research was quickly published in the open
scientific literature \[38\]. It is hard to see how information
generated in open biotech research programs could be contained no matter
how grave the potential danger that it poses; and the same holds for
research in nanotechnology.

Genetic medicine will also lead to better cures and vaccines, but [there
is [no guarantee]{.mark} that [defense will]{.mark} always [keep pace
with offense]{.mark}]{.underline}. (Even the accidentally created
mousepox virus had a 50% mortality rate on vaccinated mice.) Eventually,
worry about biological weapons may be put to rest through the
development of nanomedicine, but while nanotechnology has enormous
long-term potential for medicine \[39\] it carries its own hazards.

4.6 **[[Accidental misuse of nanotech]{.mark}nology]{.underline}**
("gray goo")

[The possibility of accidents can never be completely ruled
out]{.underline}. However, there are many ways of making sure, through
responsible engineering practices, that species-destroying accidents do
not occur. One could avoid using self-replication; one could make
nanobots dependent on some rare feedstock chemical that doesn't exist in
the wild; one could confine them to sealed environments; one could
design them in such a way that any mutation was overwhelmingly likely to
cause a nanobot to completely cease to function \[40\]. Accidental
misuse is therefore a smaller concern than malicious misuse
\[23,25,41\].

However, the distinction between the accidental and the deliberate can
become blurred. While "in principle" it seems possible to make terminal
nanotechnological accidents extremely improbable, [the actual
circumstances may [not permit]{.mark} this [ideal level of
security]{.mark} to be realized]{.underline}. Compare nanotechnology
with nuclear technology. From an engineering perspective, it is of
course perfectly possible to use nuclear technology only for peaceful
purposes such as nuclear reactors, which have a zero chance of
destroying the whole planet. Yet [in practice it may be very hard to
avoid nuclear technology also being used to build nuclear weapons,
leading to an arms race. With large nuclear arsenals on hair-trigger
alert, there is inevitably a significant risk of accidental war. The
same can happen with nanotechnology: it [may be pressed into serving
military objectives]{.mark} in a way [that carries unavoidable]{.mark}
risks of serious [accidents]{.mark}]{.underline}.

In some situations [it can even be [strategically advantageous to
deliberately make one's tech]{.mark}nology or [control systems
risky]{.mark}]{.underline}, for example in order [to make a
"threat]{.underline} that leaves something to chance" \[42\].

4.7 **[[Something unforeseen]{.underline}]{.mark}**

We need a catch-all category. [It would be foolish to be confident that
we have already imagined and anticipated all significant risks. [Future
tech]{.mark}nological or scientific [developments]{.mark}]{.underline}
may very well [[reveal]{.underline}]{.mark} novel [[ways of destroying
the world]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Some foreseen hazards (hence not members of the current category) which
have been excluded from the list of bangs on grounds that they seem too
unlikely to cause a global terminal disaster are: solar flares,
supernovae, black hole explosions or mergers, gamma-ray bursts, galactic
center outbursts, supervolcanos, loss of biodiversity, buildup of air
pollution, gradual loss of human fertility, and various religious
doomsday scenarios. The hypothesis that we will one day become
"illuminated" and commit collective suicide or stop reproducing, as
supporters of VHEMT (The Voluntary Human Extinction Movement) hope
\[43\], appears unlikely. If it really were better not to exist (as
Silenus told king Midas in the Greek myth, and as Arthur Schopenhauer
argued \[44\] although for reasons specific to his philosophical system
he didn't advocate suicide), then we should not count this scenario as
an existential disaster. The assumption that it is not worse to be alive
should be regarded as an implicit assumption in the definition of Bangs.
Erroneous collective suicide is an existential risk albeit one whose
probability seems extremely slight. (For more on the ethics of human
extinction, see chapter 4 of \[9\].)

4.8 **[[Physics disasters]{.underline}]{.mark}**

The Manhattan Project bomb-builders' concern about an A-bomb-derived
atmospheric conflagration has contemporary analogues.

There have been speculations that [future high-energy [particle
accelerator experiments]{.mark} may [cause a breakdown of]{.mark} a
[metastable vacuum state]{.mark} that our part of the cosmos might be
in, [converting it into a "true" vacuum of lower energy
density]{.mark}]{.underline} \[45\]. [This would result in an [expanding
bubble of]{.mark} total [destruction]{.mark} that would [sweep through
the galaxy]{.mark} and beyond at the speed of light, tearing all matter
apart as it proceeds]{.underline}.

Another conceivability is that [accelerator [experiments]{.mark} might
[produce]{.mark} negatively charged stable
"[strangelets]{.mark}"]{.underline} (a hypothetical form of nuclear
matter[) [or]{.mark} create [a mini black hole that would]{.mark} sink
to the center of the Earth and start [accret]{.mark}ing [the]{.mark}
rest of the [planet]{.mark}]{.underline} \[46\].

These outcomes seem to be impossible given our best current physical
theories. But the reason we do the experiments is precisely that [we
don't really know what will happen]{.underline}. A more reassuring
argument is that the energy densities attained in present day
accelerators are far lower than those that occur naturally in collisions
between cosmic rays \[46,47\]. [It's possible]{.underline}, however,
[that factors other than energy density are relevant for these
hypothetical processes, and that those factors will be brought together
in novel ways in future experiments]{.underline}.

The main reason for concern in the "physics disasters" category is the
meta-level observation that [discoveries of all sorts of weird physical
phenomena are made all the time, so [even if]{.mark} right now
[all]{.mark} the particular [physics disasters]{.mark} we have conceived
of were absurdly improbable or [impossible]{.mark}, there [could be
other]{.mark} more realistic failure-modes [waiting to be
uncovered]{.mark}]{.underline}. The ones listed here are merely
illustrations of the general case.

of course, moving as rapidly as possible to humanely reduce the human

dimensions beyond military security \[83,84\] and that [[breaches of

\*BC = Black Carbon

[The no-rubble simulation produces]{.underline} a [significantly more
intense fire]{.underline}, [with more]{.underline} fire
[spread]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} consequently [a significantly
stronger plume with larger amounts of BC reaching into the upper
atmosphere]{.underline} than the simulation with rubble, illustrated in
Figure 5. [While the no-rubble simulation **represents [the worst-case
scenario]{.mark}** involving vigorous fire activity]{.underline},
[**[only a relatively small amount of carbon makes its way into the
stratosphere]{.mark}**]{.underline} during the course of the simulation.
But while small compared to the surface BC mass, stratospheric BC
amounts from the current simulations are significantly higher than what
would be expected from burning vegetation such as trees (Heilman et al.,
2014), e.g., the higher energy density of the building fuels and the
initial fluence from the weapon produce an intense response within
HIGRAD with initial updrafts of order 100 m/s in the lower troposphere.
Or, in comparison to a mass fire, wildfires will burn only a small
amount of fuel in the corresponding time period (roughly 10 minutes)
that a nuclear weapon fluence can effectively ignite a large area of
fuel producing an impressive atmospheric response. Figure 6 shows
[vertical profiles of BC]{.underline} multiplied by 100 (number of
cities involved in the exchange) from the two simulations. The total
amount of BC produced is in line with previous estimates (about 3.69 Tg
from no-rubble simulation); however, the majority of BC
[reside]{.underline}s **[below the stratosphere]{.underline}** (3.46 Tg
below 12 km) [and can be **readily impacted by scavenging from
precipitation** either via pyro-cumulonimbus produced by the fire
itself]{.underline} (not modeled) [or other synoptic weather
systems]{.underline}. While the impact on climate of these more
realistic profiles will be explored in the next section, it should be
mentioned that **[[these estimates are]{.underline}]{.mark}** still
[**[at the high end]{.mark}**, [considering the inherent
simplifications]{.mark} in the combustion model [that lead to
**overestimating BC production**]{.mark}.]{.underline} 3.3 Climate
Results [Long-term [climatic effects]{.mark} critically [depend
on]{.mark}]{.underline} [the]{.underline} initial injection
[[height]{.mark} of the soot, with larger quantities reaching the upper
troposphere/lower stratosphere inducing a greater cooling impact because
of longer residence times]{.underline} (Robock et al., 2007a).
Absorption of solar radiation by the BC aerosol and its subsequent
radiative cooling tends to heat the surrounding air, driving an initial
upward diffusion of the soot plumes, an effect that depends on the
initial aerosol concentrations. [**[Mixing and
sedimentation]{.mark}**]{.underline} tend to [[**reduce this process**,
and low altitude emissions are]{.mark}]{.underline} also [[significantly
impacted by precipitation]{.underline}]{.mark} if aging of the BC
aerosol occurs on sufficiently rapid timescales. But once at
stratospheric altitudes, aerosol dilution via coagulation is hindered by
low particulate concentrations (e.g., Robock et al., 2007a) and lofting
to much higher altitudes is inhibited by gravitational settling in the
low-density air (Stenke et al., 2013), resulting in more stable BC
concentrations over long times. [[Of the initial BC]{.mark}]{.underline}
mass [released in the atmosphere]{.underline}, most of which is emitted
below 9 km, [**[70% rains out within the first month]{.mark}** and
78%]{.underline}, or about 2.9 Tg, [is removed within the first two
months]{.underline} (Figure 7, solid line), with the remainder (about
0.8 Tg, dashed line) being transported above about 12 km (200 hPa)
within the first week. This outcome differs from the findings of, e.g.,
Stenke et al. (2013, their high BC-load cases) and Mills et al. (2014),
who found that most of the BC mass (between 60 and 70%) is lifted in the
stratosphere within the first couple of weeks. This can also be seen in
Figure 8 (red lines) and in Figure 9, which include results from our
calculation with the initial BC distribution from Mills et al. (2014).
In that case, only 30% of the initial BC mass rains out in the
troposphere during the first two weeks after the exchange, with the
remainder rising to the stratosphere. In the study of Mills et al.
(2008) this percentage is somewhat smaller, about 20%, and smaller still
in the experiments of Robock et al. (2007a) in which the soot is
initially emitted in the upper troposphere or higher. In Figure 7, the
e-folding timescale for the removal of tropospheric soot, here
interpreted as the time required for an initial drop of a factor e, is
about one week. This result compares favorably with the "LT" experiment
of Robock et al. (2007a), considering 5 Tg of BC released in the lower
troposphere, in which 50% of the aerosols are removed within two weeks.
By contrast, the initial e-folding timescale for the removal of
stratospheric soot in Figure 8 is about 4.2 years (blue solid line),
compared to about 8.4 years for the calculation using Mills et al.
(2014) initial BC emission (red solid line). The removal timescale from
our forced ensemble simulations is close to those obtained by Mills et
al. (2008) in their 1 Tg experiment, by Robock et al. (2007a) in their
experiment "UT 1 Tg", and © 2018 American Geophysical Union. All rights
reserved. by Stenke et al. (2013) in their experiment "Exp1", in all of
which 1 Tg of soot was emitted in the atmosphere in the aftermath of the
exchange. Notably, the e-folding timescale for the decline of the BC
mass in Figure 8 (blue solid line) is also close to the value of about 4
years quoted by Pausata et al. (2016) for their long-term "intermediate"
scenario. In that scenario, which is also based on 5 Tg of soot
initially distributed as in Mills et al. (2014), the factor-of2 shorter
residence time of the aerosols is caused by particle growth via
coagulation of BC with organic carbon. Figure 9 shows the BC mass-mixing
ratio, horizontally averaged over the globe, as a function of
atmospheric pressure (height) and time. [The BC
distributions]{.underline} used [in]{.underline} our
[simulations]{.underline} [imply that]{.underline} the [upward transport
of particles]{.underline} [is substantially less efficient compared to
the case in]{.underline} [which]{.underline} 5 Tg of [BC is directly
injected into the upper troposphere]{.underline}. The semiannual cycle
of lofting and sinking of the aerosols is associated with atmospheric
heating and cooling during the solstice in each hemisphere (Robock et
al., 2007a). During the first year, the oscillation amplitude in our
forced ensemble simulations is particularly large during the summer
solstice, compared to that during the winter solstice (see bottom panel
of Figure 9), because of the higher soot concentrations in the Northern
Hemisphere, as can be seen in Figure 11 (see also left panel of Figure
12). Comparing the top and bottom panels of Figure 9, the BC reaches the
highest altitudes during the first year in both cases, but the
concentrations at 0.1 hPa in the top panel can be 200 times as large.
Qualitatively, [the difference can be understood in terms of the air
temperature increase caused by BC radiation emission]{.underline},
[which is several tens of kelvin degrees in]{.underline} the
[simulations]{.underline} [of Robock]{.underline} et al. (2007a, see
their Figure 4), [Mills]{.underline} et al. (2008, see their Figure 5),
[Stenke]{.underline} et al. (2013, see high-load cases in their Figure
4), Mills et al. (2014, see their Figure 7), [and Pausata]{.underline}
et al. (2016, see one-day emission cases in their Figure 1), [due to
high BC concentrations, but]{.underline} it [amounts to only about 10 K
in our]{.underline} forced [ensemble simulations]{.underline}, as
illustrated in Figure 10. Results similar to those presented in Figure
10 were obtained from the experiment "Exp1" performed by Stenke et al.
(2013, see their Figure 4). [**In that scenario as well, somewhat less
that 1 Tg of BC remained in the atmosphere after the initial
rainout**.]{.underline} As mentioned before, the BC aerosol that remains
in the atmosphere, lifted to stratospheric heights by the rising soot
plumes, undergoes sedimentation over a timescale of several years
(Figures 8 and 9). This mass represents the effective amount of BC that
can force climatic changes over multi-year timescales. In the forced
ensemble simulations, it is about 0.8 Tg after the initial rainout,
whereas it is about 3.4 Tg in the simulation with an initial soot
distribution as in Mills et al. (2014). Our more realistic source
simulation involves the worstcase assumption of no-rubble (along with
other assumptions) and hence serves as an upper bound for the impact on
climate. As mentioned above and further discussed below, our scenario
induces perturbations on the climate system similar to those found in
previous studies in which the climatic response was driven by roughly 1
Tg of soot rising to stratospheric heights following the exchange.
Figure 11 illustrates the vertically integrated mass-mixing ratio of BC
over the globe, at various times after the exchange for the simulation
using the initial BC distribution of Mills et al. (2014, upper panels)
and as an average from the forced ensemble members (lower panels). All
simulations predict enhanced concentrations at high latitudes during the
first year after the exchange. In the cases shown in the top panels,
however, these high concentrations persist for several years (see also
Figure 1 of Mills et al., 2014), whereas the forced ensemble simulations
indicate that the BC concentration starts to decline after the first
year. In fact, in the simulation represented in the top panels,
mass-mixing ratios larger than about 1 kg of BC © 2018 American
Geophysical Union. All rights reserved. per Tg of air persist for well
over 10 years after the exchange, whereas they only last for 3 years in
our forced simulations (compare top and middle panels of Figure 9).
After the first year, values drop below 3 kg BC/Tg air, whereas it takes
about 8 years to reach these values in the simulation in the top panels
(see also Robock et al., 2007a). Over crop-producing, midlatitude
regions in the Northern Hemisphere, the BC loading is reduced from more
than 0.8 kg BC/Tg air in the simulation in the top panels to 0.2-0.4 kg
BC/Tg air in our forced simulations (see middle and right panels). The
more rapid clearing of the atmosphere in the forced ensemble is also
signaled by the soot optical depth in the visible radiation spectrum,
which drops below values of 0.03 toward the second half of the first
year at mid latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere, and everywhere on the
globe after about 2.5 years (without never attaining this value in the
Southern Hemisphere). In contrast, the soot optical depth in the
calculation shown in the top panels of Figure 11 becomes smaller than
0.03 everywhere only after about 10 years. The two cases show a similar
tendency, in that the BC optical depth is typically lower between
latitudes 30º S-30º N than it is at other latitudes. This behavior is
associated to the persistence of stratospheric soot toward
high-latitudes and the Arctic/Antarctic regions, as illustrated by the
zonally-averaged, column-integrated mass-mixing ratio of the BC in
Figure 12 for both the forced ensemble simulations (left panel) and the
simulation with an initial 5 Tg BC emission in the upper troposphere
(right panel). The spread in the globally averaged (near) surface
temperature of the atmosphere, from the control (left panel) and forced
(right panel) ensembles, is displayed in Figure 13. For each month, the
plots show the largest variations (i.e., maximum and minimum values),
within each ensemble of values obtained for that month, relative to the
mean value of that month. The plot also shows yearly-averaged data
(thinner lines). The spread is comparable in the control and forced
ensembles, with average values calculated over the 33-years run length
of 0.4-0.5 K. This spread is also similar to the internal variability of
the globally averaged surface temperature quoted for the NCAR Large
Ensemble Community Project (Kay et al., 2015). These results imply that
surface air temperature differences, between forced and control
simulations, which lie within the spread may not be distinguished from
effects due to internal variability of the two simulation ensembles.
Figure 14 shows the difference in the globally averaged surface
temperature of the atmosphere (top panel), net solar radiation flux at
surface (middle panel), and precipitation rate (bottom panel), computed
as the (forced minus control) difference in ensemble mean values. The
sum of standard deviations from each ensemble is shaded. Differences are
qualitatively significant over the first few years, when the anomalies
lie near or outside the total standard deviation. Inside the shaded
region, differences may not be distinguished from those arising from the
internal variability of one or both ensembles. The surface solar flux
(middle panel) is the quantity that appears most affected by the BC
emission, with qualitatively significant differences persisting for
about 5 years. The precipitation rate (bottom panel) is instead affected
only at the very beginning of the simulations. The red lines in all
panels show the results from the simulation applying the initial BC
distribution of Mills et al. (2014), where the period of significant
impact is much longer owing to the higher altitude of the initial soot
distribution that results in longer residence times of the BC aerosol in
the atmosphere. When yearly averages of the same quantities are
performed over the IndiaPakistan region, the differences in ensemble
mean values lie within the total standard deviations of the two
ensembles. The results in Figure 14 can also be compared to the outcomes
of other previous studies. In their experiment "UT 1 Tg", Robock et al.
(2007a) found that, when only 1 Tg of soot © 2018 American Geophysical
Union. All rights reserved. remains in the atmosphere after the initial
rainout, temperature and precipitation anomalies are about 20% of those
obtained from their standard 5 Tg BC emission case. Therefore, the
largest differences they observed, during the first few years after the
exchange, were about - 0.3 K and -0.06 mm/day, respectively, comparable
to the anomalies in the top and bottom panels of Figure 14. Their
standard 5 Tg emission case resulted in a solar radiation flux anomaly
at surface of -12 W/m2 after the second year (see their Figure 3),
between 5 and 6 time as large as the corresponding anomalies from our
ensembles shown in the middle panel. In their experiment "Exp1", Stenke
et al. (2013) reported global mean surface temperature anomalies not
exceeding about 0.3 K in magnitude and precipitation anomalies hovering
around -0.07 mm/day during the first few years, again consistent with
the results of Figure 14. In a recent study, Pausata et al. (2016)
considered the effects of an admixture of BC and organic carbon
aerosols, both of which would be emitted in the atmosphere in the
aftermath of a nuclear exchange. In particular, they concentrated on the
effects of coagulation of these aerosol species and examined their
climatic impacts. The initial BC distribution was as in Mills et al.
(2014), although the soot burden was released in the atmosphere over
time periods of various lengths. Most relevant to our and other previous
work are their one-day emission scenarios. They found that, during the
first year, the largest values of the atmospheric surface temperature
anomalies ranged between about -0.5 and -1.3 K, those of the sea surface
temperature anomalies ranged between -0.2 and -0.55 K, and those of the
precipitation anomalies varied between -0.15 and -0.2 mm/day. All these
ranges are compatible with our results shown in Figure 14 as red lines
and with those of Mills et al. (2014, see their Figures 3 and 6). As
already mentioned in Section 2.3, the net solar flux anomalies at
surface are also consistent. [This]{.underline} overall agreement
[suggests that [the **inclusion of organic carbon aerosols**]{.mark}**,
and** ensuing **coagulation** with BC, **[should not dramatically alter
the climatic effects]{.mark}** resulting from our forced ensemble
simulations. Moreover, [aerosol growth]{.mark} would likely **[shorten

CATASTROPHE AND THE END OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS In the year 2025, the world
very nearly came to an end. Smarting after several years of economic
downturn and angry at American efforts to encircle it with NATO bases,
Russia responded to a \"plea\" for help from co-ethnics in the Baltic
states. Thousands of Russian troops, disguised as contract
\"volunteers\" dashed across international borders allegedly to protect
Russian speakers from governmental assaults. The Baltic countries
invoked Article 5 of the NATO Treaty while American forces, deployed
there precisely to deter this kind of aggression, clashed with Russian
troops. Hundreds of Americans were killed. Washington warned Moscow to
halt its invasion to no avail. The United States then prepared for a
major airlift of its forces to the beleaguered countries, with Moscow
threatening America with \"unrestrained force\" if it followed through.
Washington ignored the threat and Moscow, seeking to \"de-escalate by
escalating,\" destroyed the American base of Diego Garcia in the Indian
Ocean with a nuclear-armed cruise missile. The United States responded
with **[[limited nuclear strikes]{.underline}]{.mark}** against Russian
bases in Siberia. Thus far, the collateral damage had been kept to a
minimum, but this bit of encouragement did not last. Fearing a massive
American pre-emptive strike aimed at disarming its nuclear arsenal,
**[Russia]{.underline}** struck first [against the]{.underline} range of
**[US]{.underline}** nuclear forces both in the United States and at
sea. America responded with its surviving weapons,
[destroying]{.underline} much (but not all) of the
**[remaining]{.underline}** Russian **[nuclear arms]{.underline}**. And
then, both sides took a breather, but it was too late. [Although
**cities**]{.underline} [had been largely spared,

#### Can't rebuild industrial civilization.

A suggestion, for the sake of thought: [[If industrial civilization
collapsed, it **probably could not be rebuilt**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[**Civilization** would exist again, of course, but [**industry**
appears to be a **one-time experiment**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
astronomist **[Fred Hoyle]{.underline}**, exaggerating slightly,
[writes]{.underline}: It has often been said that, if the human species
fails to make a go of it here on Earth, some other species will take
over the running. In the sense of developing high intelligence this is
not correct. [We]{.underline} [have, or soon will have, [exhausted the
**necessary physical prerequisites**]{.mark}]{.underline} [so far as
this planet is concerned. [With coal]{.mark} gone, [oil]{.mark} gone,
[high-grade metallic ores gone, **no species however**]{.mark}
**[competent can make the]{.mark} long [climb from primitive conditions
to high-level technology]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[This is a **one-shot
affair**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [If we fail, **this planetary system
fails so far as intelligence is concerned**]{.underline}. The same will
be true of other planetary systems. On each of them [there will be one
chance, and **one chance only**]{.underline}. Hoyle overstates all the
limits we actually have to worry about, but there are enough to affirm
his belief that industry is a "one-shot affair." In other words, [if
industry collapsed then no matter how quickly scientific knowledge
allows societies to progress, [technical development will hit a
wall]{.mark} because the builders will not have the needed
**materials**]{.underline}. For example, [[much of the world's land is
not arable]{.mark}, and some of the land in use today is only productive
because of industrial technics developed during the agricultural
revolution in the 60s, technics heavily dependent on]{.underline}
**[oil]{.underline}**. [Without the systems that sustain industrial
agriculture much current farm land could not be farmed; agricultural
civilizations cannot exist there, at least until the **soil
replenishes**, **if** it replenishes. And some resources required for
industrial progress, like **coal**]{.underline}, [simply **are not
feasibly accessible anymore**]{.underline}. Tainter writes: . . . major
jumps in population, at around A.D. 1300, 1600, and in the late
eighteenth century, each led to intensification in agriculture and
industry. As the land in the late Middle Ages was increasingly
deforested to provide fuel and agricultural space for a growing
population, basic heating, cooking, and manufacturing needs could no
longer be met by burning wood. A shift to reliance on coal began,
gradually and with apparent reluctance. [Coal was definitely a fuel
source of secondary desirability, being more costly to obtain and
distribute than wood, as well as being dirty and polluting. Coal was
more restricted in its **spatial** distribution than wood, so that a
whole **new, costly distribution system had to be
developed**]{.underline}. [Mining of coal from the ground was more
costly than obtaining a quantity of wood equivalent in heating value,
and became even more costly as the 54 most accessible reserves of this
fuel were depleted. Mines had to be sunk ever deeper, until groundwater
flooding became a serious problem. Today, [most easily
accessible]{.mark} natural coal [reserves are **completely
depleted**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Thus, [societies in the **wake
of**]{.mark}]{.underline} our imagined [**[collapse]{.underline}**
[would]{.underline} **[not be able to develop fast
enough]{.underline}**]{.mark} [to reach the underground coal. As a
result of these limits, [rebuilding industry would take **at least
thousands of years**]{.mark}]{.underline} [--- it took **10,000** years
the **first time**]{.underline} around. [By the time a
[civilization]{.mark} reached the point where it could do something
about **industrial** scientific knowledge it probably **[would not have
the knowledge anymore]{.mark}**.]{.underline} [It would have to develop
its sciences and technologies on its **own**]{.underline}, resulting in
patterns of development that would probably look similar to historical
patterns. Technology today depends on levels of complexity that must
proceed in chronological stages. Solar panels, for example, rely on
transportation infrastructure, mining, and a regulated division of
labor. And historically the process of developing into a global
civilization includes numerous instances of technical regression. The
natives of Tasmania, for example, went from a maritime society to one
that didn't fish, build boats, or make bows and arrows. [Rebuilding
civilization would also be a **bad idea**]{.underline}. [Most, who are
exploited by rather than benefit from industry, would probably not view
a rebuilding project as **desirable**]{.underline}. Even today, though
citizens of first-world nations live physically comfortable lives, their
lives are sustained by the worse off lives of the rest of the world.
"Civilization . . . has operated two ways," Paine writes, "to make one
part of society more affluent, and the other more wretched, than would
have been the lot of either in a natural state." Consider the case of
two societies in New Zealand, the Maori and the Moriori. Both are now
believed to have originated out of the same mainland society. Most
stayed and became the Maori we know, and some who became the Moriori
people settled on the Chatham Islands in the 16th century. Largely due
to a chief named Nunuku-whenua, the Moriori had a strict tradition of
solving inter-tribal conflict peacefully and advocating a variant of
passive resistance; war, cannibalism, and killing were completely
outlawed. They also renounced their parent society's agricultural mode
of subsistence, relying heavily on hunting and gathering, and they
controlled their population growth by castrating some male infants, so
their impact on the non-human environment around them was minimal. In
the meantime, the Maori continued to live agriculturally and developed
into a populated, complex, hierarchical, and violent society. Eventually
an Australian seal-hunting ship informed the Maori of the Moriori's
existence, and the Maori sailed to the Chathams to explore: . . . over
the course of the next few days, they killed hundreds of Moriori, cooked
and ate many of the bodies, and enslaved all the others, killing most of
them too over the next few years as it suited their whim. A Moriori
survivor recalled, "\[The Maori\] commenced to kill us like sheep . . .
\[We\] were terrified, fled to the bush, concealed ourselves in holes
underground, and in any place to escape our enemies. It was of no avail;
we were discovered and eaten -- men, women, and children
indiscriminately." A Maori conqueror explains, "We took possession . . .
in accordance with our customs and we caught all the people. Not one
escaped. Some ran away from us, these we killed, and others we killed --
but what of that? It was in accordance with our custom." Furthermore, we
can deduce from the ubiquitous slavery in all the so-called "great
civilizations" like Rome or Egypt that any attempt to rebuild a similar
civilization will involve slavery. And to rebuild industry, something
similar to colonization and the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade would
probably have to occur once again. After all, global chattel slavery
enabled the industrial revolution by financing it, extracting resources
to be accumulated at sites of production, and exporting products through
infrastructure that slavery helped sustain. So, if industrial society
collapsed, who would be doing the rebuilding? Not anyone most people
like. It is hard to get a man to willingly change his traditional way of
life; even harder when his new life is going into mines. And though
history demonstrates that acts like those of the Maori or slave traders
are not beyond man's will or ability, certainly **[most]{.underline}**
[in industrial society today **would not advocate going through the
phases required to reach the industrial stage of
development**]{.underline}.

Costs [While this measure would be quite expensive, it would probably be
much cheaper than **even the most optimistic assessments of colonizing

Conclusion The notion of [black swan extinction events]{.underline}
[present]{.underline} us with a daunting task. How to even start
thinking about risks that are unknown? The stakes are further raised
when considering that, on a large number of normative theories, an
existential catastrophe implies [a staggering loss of value. Thus, it is
unwise to ignore the risk such an event represents]{.underline}. In
engineering safety, a number of heuristics and strategies are device to
prevent a catastrophic failure in a large number of possible scenarios.
These strategies could be employed in thinking about how to reduce the
risk of a black swan extinction event. Safety barriers are an instance
of such a strategy. These could be actual physical barriers in some
systems, or subsystems that prevent catastrophic failure by
compartmentalization and physical separation. This article has discussed
an example implementation of this strategy: [[isolated, continuously
manned and self-sufficient]{.mark} underground
[refuges]{.mark}]{.underline} that [could [protect a large enough number
of people to ensure]{.mark} the [continued existence]{.mark} of mankind.
While building such a ''doomsday shelter'' is **less glamorous** than
colonizing the Moon, it may give us **much more risk reduction for the
money invested**]{.underline}. The conceptual sketch of the project in
this paper should be further developed in an interdisciplinary research
project, which could benefit from the extensive literature on isolated,
self-containing habitats. Architecture, engineering, social psychology
and decision theory would probably be needed to fully assess the costs,
and social and technological challenges.

even]{.underline} [**[highly intelligent and technologically
advanced]{.underline}** [life]{.underline}]{.mark}, but, as the famous
Fermi paradox posits32, there is no trace of any extraterrestrial
intelligence. Be that as it may, it is possible that there is
extraterrestrial life beyond Earth, and it is possible that **[[we will
come into contact with]{.mark} extraterrestrial life [due to
colonization]{.mark} activity]{.underline}**. What should our moral
attitude towards extraterrestrial life look like? The moral issue of our
attitudes towards extraterrestrial life can be divided into three
classes of problems, according to the type of life we are dealing with:
Primitive non-sentient life. Primitive sentient life. Non-primitive
sentient life. Primitive non-sentient life are life forms that resemble
microbial life forms on Earth, such as bacteria. Extraterrestrial
microbial life can be of great instrumental value, specifically to
humans, but also in a more general sense. That is a strong argument in
favor of studying and preserving extraterrestrial microbial life33; we
should not go out of our way to destroy microbial life, because that
life might be very useful. The main moral issue about primitive
non-sentient life, however, is not the question of instrumental value,
but rather the question of intrinsic value: Is there a moral obligation
for humans not to manipulate or even end extraterrestrial microbial life
forms? This problem is, in all likelihood, the most pressing moral issue
about extraterrestrial life and space colonization and one that deserves
greater practical attention34. A common argument in favor of the
intrinsic value position is that of conation or goal-orientedness35 36:
Because even microbial life forms act vaguely rational (they have goals
and behave so as to achieve their goals), their existence has some
intrinsic value. The problem with this moral argument is that it can
easily lead to the conclusion of strong conservationism, whereby any
habitable planet or moon should remain uncolonized, lest we interfere
with microbes that we might have failed to detect37. In addition, if we
accept a strong version of the intrinsic value argument, we already have
immense moral problems: On Earth, we do not particularly care for any
microbial life form on intrinsic grounds, and we even actively fight
some of them. Primitive sentient life are life forms that are not as
intelligent as humans, but that are sentient, in the sense of being able
to experience positive or negative affective states. Even though
sentience is not a perfectly precise concept38, and even though we lack
the means for truly assessing qualia (subjective experiences) of life
forms other than humans39, it is almost certain that we humans are not
the only life form capable of experiencing pain and pain-related
suffering and that many animals on our planet are sentient as well40.
Sentient extraterrestrial life forms require a different moral stance
than non-sentient life forms. Imagine, for example, that two human space
ship are about to land on an exoplanet. As the space ships are landing,
the exhaust from their engines heats up the ground. Space ship A is
landing on a nest of insect-like non-sentient life forms, frying them
alive in the process. Space ship B is landing on a herd of bunny-like
sentient creatures, frying them alive in the process. Both outcomes are
unfortunate, but undoubtedly, killing the sentient bunny-like creatures
must be morally worse than killing the non-sentient insect-like
creatures, because the bunnies experienced enormous pain while they were
being killed. Our moral stance towards sentient primitive
extraterrestrial life will have to take sentience into account. Avoiding
suffering in sentient extraterrestrial life should be a universal rule
of space colonization. Somewhat obviously, such a rule would also
prohibit treating sentient extraterrestrial life forms as food (But it
is highly improbable that humans would have to routinely rely on
extraterrestrial sentient life forms as sources of nutrition, even
though we would be technologically advanced enough to engage in
intersolar space colonization. We are in the process of overcoming
traditional agriculture today41; reverting to traditional agriculture on
future extrasolar colonies would amount to an extraordinarily improbable
and inefficient anachronism.). Non-primitive sentient life are life
forms that are sentient and possess a general intelligence at least as
great as our own (It is possible that highly intelligent life forms
might be non-sentient, but at least on Earth, sentience seems to
correlate with intelligence.). The moral challenge of this type of
extraterrestrial life is the same as with primitive sentient life, and
there are additional moral problems to consider. If there are
intelligent life forms beyond Earth, their levels of technological
development will have great variance; some life forms will be
intelligent, but not yet developed, whereas others will be intelligent
and much more technologically advanced than we are. Intelligent life
forms that are less technologically developed than we are present us
with a moral problem: Should we interact with such civilizations and try
to help them develop faster and overcome problems? This moral problem
has perhaps most famously been explored in the television show Star Trek
with its "Prime Directive": The fictional United Federation of Planets
is never to interfere with a technologically undeveloped civilization in
order to avoid doing damage (Alas, the protagonists of Star Trek end up
violating the Prime Directive time and again; doing so makes for a good
story.). More generally, the problem of non-interference can be
described as a reversed Zoo hypothesis42, whereby it is not
extraterrestrial civilizations treating Earth like a conservation
project, but us humans pondering whether we should treat
extraterrestrial civilizations as conservation projects. A strong
argument in favor of non-interference is the risk of both causing bad
outcomes, both in the short- as well as in the long-term. Interacting
with less developed civilizations might inadvertently do more harm than
good, and it might steer the affected civilizations away from a path to
development that might be beneficial to humankind in the long run. On
the other hand, however, not investing a small amount of resources to
greatly improve lives and reduce suffering seems morally dubious. If an
extraterrestrial civilization that is going through a historical era
similar to our Middle Ages is confronted with some catastrophic disease
like our Black Death pandemic, not helping that civilization fight that
pandemic seems cruel; not least because the cost for helping that
civilization would almost certainly be trivially low. 3.4 Cosmic
suffering Imagine that humankind has successfully mastered phase II
colonization (colonization beyond our Solar System). All the problems
described in the previous sections and subsections have long been
successfully solved, and humankind is progressing steadily and
peacefully. Then, something happens. At some point and for some reason,
future humans decide that they do not want to merely engage in space
colonization, but to do more: Actively seed the universe with
(non-human) life43. Given the technological development of future
humankind, it is relatively easy to send out non-sentient primitive life
forms across the galaxy. Unfortunately, something horrible happens: The
primitive microbial life-forms sent out into the cosmos mutate into
aggressive bacteria that attack any life form they encounter, including
sentient life -- and in doing so, they cause tremendous pain and agony
in the organisms they attack. The benevolent idea of spreading life has
quickly turned into unimaginable suffering of trillions of sentient
beings across the galaxy. Colonizing humans have thus created suffering
on a cosmic, or astronomical, scale44. Cosmic suffering is the risk of
creating suffering on a scale that is either not possible or not as
probable without space colonization. There are many potential scenarios
in which successful space colonization results in cosmic suffering. For
example, the general problem of the repugnant conclusion discussed
further above can also be regarded as an example of this class of risks.
Cosmic suffering is a severe problem because it is contingent on, or at
least made more likely by, successful space colonization. The
conceptually challenging aspect of cosmic suffering is the correlation
of cosmic suffering with the degree of space colonization: The greater
the level of space colonization, the greater the risks of cosmic
suffering become. This is the opposite of the relationship between space
colonization and existential risks: The greater the level of space
colonization, the lower existential risks become -- this is one of the
main motivations for space colonization, after all. In other words,
successful space colonization decreases the probability that something
goes wrong for humankind in terms of existential risks, but it increases
the probability that something goes wrong in terms of suffering for the
whole universe. 4. Security challenges In the above discussions of
political and moral challenges, it is presumed that the problems and
challenges that arise do so in a generally peaceful system of
colonization. However, peace in the sense of a lack of armed conflict is
not guaranteed with space colonization. On the contrary: Space
colonization might produce new kinds of security challenges. 4.1
Inter-colonial war Violence and war have been decreasing over the course
of our civilization's history45 46 47. The decrease in violent armed
conflict has coincided with an increase in cultural, political, and
economic interconnectedness. Even though major armed conflicts are not
yet a thing of the past48, humankind will probably continue on its
current trajectory of peace. With space colonization, however, the trend
of growing closer together might reverse because of increasing
fragmentation, and with that reversal, peaceful cooperation might again
give way to armed conflict. [[Some]{.mark} amount of]{.underline}
**[[human]{.mark} [fragmentation]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[due to space
col]{.mark}onization [is]{.mark}]{.underline} almost
[**[inevitable]{.mark}**. One of the strongest biases we humans have is
the]{.underline} **[intergroup]{.underline}** [bias]{.underline}49: We
tend to separate people into ingroups and outgroups, and we generally
favor our own ingroup over any outgroup. [Our ingroup favoritism is
often the source of]{.underline} **[collective identity]{.underline}**:
We identify with our home city and think it is better than other cities;
we identify with our favorite football team and think it is better than
other teams; we identify with our country of origin and think it is
better than other countries. In a future in which humans have
successfully mastered type I colonization (colonization within our Solar
System) and perhaps even type II colonization (intersolar colonization),
belonging to one habitat rather than another will almost certainly also
be a source of collective identity. [Humans born and raised on Venus
would probably have more positive general attitudes towards Venus than
towards **Earth**. That]{.underline} is not a problem in and of itself,
but it [**can become a problem**: If humankind is very successful at
space colonization and manages to establish colonies across the galaxy,
the **[ingroup dynamics]{.mark} within colonies**]{.underline} and
regions of colonies [[might grow]{.underline} **[so much]{.underline}**
[that]{.underline}]{.mark} [the]{.underline} **[pe[rceived benefits of
armed conflict increase]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,]{.mark} and the
perceived costs decrease. In part, this might be due to the
infrahumanization (or dehumanization) bias50: Our intergroup bias can
have the effect of perceiving members of the outgroup as less human than
members of our own ingroup. The problem of intergroup bias and armed
conflict [[could be compounded by]{.mark} real]{.underline}
[**[biological]{.underline}** [differences]{.underline}]{.mark} in the
long-term future. In the long term, [different colonies of humans might
adopt different stances on human enhancement technology and embrace
different kinds of enhancement technologies. These [differential
paths]{.mark}]{.underline} of human enhancement [might
[result]{.mark}]{.underline} [[in]{.underline}
**[tech]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[nology-[induced
quasi-speciation]{.mark}]{.underline}**, whereby different strands of
humans have increasingly distinct biological traits. The ultimate result
of such a development might be a strong fragmentation of humankind and
an increasing arms race in order to defend against the outgroup of all
the (former) humans that are different from the ingroup (former)
humans51. 4.2 Extraterrestrial (existential) risks [[Space
col]{.mark}onization will [increase]{.mark} the [probability of
discovering]{.mark} and coming into contact with]{.underline}
[**[extraterrestrial intelligence]{.mark}**, either
**biological**]{.underline} [or]{.underline}
**[artificial]{.underline}** (in the sense of hypothetical advanced
artificial general intelligence52). [[That]{.mark} prospect]{.underline}
poses some moral challenges, as argued in subsection 3.3. However, it
[might]{.underline} also [[pose]{.mark} a]{.underline} **[[security
challenge]{.underline}]{.mark}** [if an extraterrestrial intelligence
more technologically advanced than humankind]{.underline} [has goals and
preferences that go]{.underline} **[against the goals and preferences of
humankind.]{.underline}** In general, there are three categories of
attitudes an extraterrestrial intelligence can have towards humankind53.
First, an extraterrestrial intelligence can be benevolent. A benevolent
extraterrestrial intelligence is one that would change its goals and
preferences upon learning of humankind. Humankind is a benevolent
intelligence: If we, for example, came into contact with an
extraterrestrial civilization, we would obviously take the goals and
preferences of that civilization into account and update our own goals
and preferences, since we are morally advanced enough to do so. Second,
an extraterrestrial intelligence can be apathetic. An apathetic
extraterrestrial intelligence is one that does not at all change its
goals and preferences upon learning of humankind. An apathetic
intelligence would neither try to accommodate humankind, nor would it
react in some non-friendly way. It would not care at all. The attitude
of an apathetic intelligence is similar to the attitude we humans have
when it comes to some random microbial life form on Earth: We might
understand that that life form exists, but we do not care either way.
Third, [an [extraterrestrial intelligence can be]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[hostile]{.underline}**]{.mark}. Hostility in a general sense means
that an intelligence reacts to learning of humankind by regarding its
own goals and preferences as categorically more important than
humankind's. [A hostile extraterrestrial intelligence is not necessarily
a security threat to humankind]{.underline}; hostility in this context
does not mean hostility in the Hollywood kind but hostility in the sense
of active disregard of humankind's goals and preferences.
[[That]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, [[might]{.underline}]{.mark} still
[[represent]{.mark} a]{.underline} **[[tremendous security
risk]{.underline}]{.mark}**. For example, [a hostile intelligence
might]{.underline} **[prefer humankind not to exist]{.underline}**
[because our **mere existence**]{.underline} [is perceived as a **slight
discomfort**]{.underline} [to the extraterrestrial intelligence.
[Hostile extraterrestrial intelligence]{.mark} thus [represents]{.mark}
a]{.underline} **[form of [existential risk]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

5\. Space-Age Weaponry and the Balance of Terror Yet there is another
strategy for neutralizing the Hobbesian trap, namely, a policy of
deterrence, also known as a "balance of terror" or, during the Cold War,
"mutually-assured destruction" (MAD). This asserts that "if you strike
me, I will most assuredly strike back with equal or greater force, and
if I strike you it will only be because you struck me first."xvii
Deterrence is only effective when one's adversaries genuinely believe
the statement, "I will most assuredly strike back." This returns us to
Hobbes's third cause of conflict from section 3: glory, honor, or
credibility. To establish credibility and, therefore, dissuade potential
attackers, one has reason to engage in confrontations with others and,
in doing so, to demonstrate one's capacity for violence. The question is
whether policies of deterrence implemented by civilizations throughout
the cosmos would be sufficient to obviate war. To answer this question,
let's begin by considering the unsettling range of weapons that will
likely be available to our spacefaring progeny; we will then explore how
these weapons could enhance or mitigate the effectiveness of deterrence.
5.1 **[[Weapons of Total Destruction (WTDs]{.underline}]{.mark}**)
[[There are]{.mark} a variety of "[kill mechanisms" that one
civilization could use to obliterate another. In]{.mark} relatively
[**close propinquity**, **chemical**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[and]{.underline} **[bio]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[logical
[weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}** [could [offer]{.mark} a means of
[targeted violence]{.mark}]{.underline}, since the deleterious effects
of such weapons might be limited to a particular species (Deudney
forthcoming). For example, the toxicity of a chemical X might be low for
a species A but lethal to a species B. This could enable A to use X on B
without fear of X harming A---a concern that has dissuaded some
terrorists from employing chemical weapons. The same goes for a
pathogenic germ Y: since pathogens often only harm single species,
biological weapons could be used without the perpetrators worrying about
becoming sick. [With respect to]{.underline}
**[a]{.underline}**rtificial **[i]{.underline}**ntelligences, [there
could be]{.underline} **[viral malware]{.underline}** [that affects only
certain types of software]{.underline}; in this case, [such viruses
could be transferred not at the velocity of a sneeze but at the speed of
light]{.underline}, traversing astronomically large stretches of space
to devastate colonies of artificial-substrate beings. [Another
possibility involves **weaponizing**]{.underline} "minor planets" like
**[asteroids]{.underline}**. This hints at the deflection dilemma
discussed by Sagan (1994), among others, whereby the very same
technology that could deflect an asteroid away from Earth could also be
used to redirect one toward it. [The resultant "[planetoid bombs" could
be]{.mark} [launched]{.mark} in the direction of target civilizations
[at extremely **high velocities**]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}[and
inflict]{.underline} **[far greater destruction than all the nuclear
arsenals on Earth combined]{.underline}** (see Cole and Cox 1965;
Deudney forthcoming). [Even more, asteroids are **extremely
numerous**]{.underline} [in the solar system]{.underline} and have a
wide range of sizes, with estimates of 1.1 to 1.9 million that have
greater-than-1-kilometer diameters in the asteroid belt between Mars and
Jupiter. ([A 1- kilometer impactor striking Earth would
likely]{.underline} **[annihilate humanity]{.underline}** [by causing
an]{.underline} **[impact winter]{.underline}**.) Thus, [asteroids
constitute an abundant source of easily obtainable,]{.underline}
[**[civilization-ending weaponry]{.mark}**--- a particularly worrisome
fact given that the technological capabilities to redirect asteroids
will likely **[emerge]{.mark} at an early stage in our diaspora "out of
Earth,"**]{.underline} as it were (see Deudney forthcoming). [Other
futuristic space weapons include **military drones**]{.underline} that
either initiate attacks or engage in clandestine surveillance of other
civilizations. [Such drones could]{.underline} hide themselves from
counter-surveillance detectors by employing metamaterial invisibility
cloaks and [**propagate themselves** through]{.underline} the [von
Neumann]{.underline} process of [self-replication]{.underline}, that is,
by converting raw materials into clones of themselves. There is also the
possibility of using "heliobeams," or "sun guns," to destroy targets by
concentrating large amounts of solar radiation via a concave mirror on a
satellite. [[Even]{.underline} **[more catastrophic]{.underline}**
[are]{.underline}]{.mark} direct-energy weapons
(**[[DEWs]{.underline}]{.mark}**) like lasers and particlebeams that use
highly focused energy to superheat their targets. [In fact, the US
government has already developed weapons of this
sort]{.underline}---they are science fact rather than
fiction---[although future breakthroughs could enable them to become
immensely more destructive. If this is the case, [they]{.mark} will
offer yet another mechanism for]{.underline} **[[wreak]{.mark}ing
[unprecedented harm]{.mark}]{.underline}** (see Deudney forthcoming).
Along these lines, Anders Sandberg (forthcoming) [suggests that
technologically advanced civilizations could potentially
use]{.underline} **[gravitational waves]{.underline}** [to
create]{.underline} [**black holes**. Generating waves of sufficient
intensity would be **energetically inefficient**, according to current
physics, but they have the advantage that they can **interact with dark
matter objects**]{.underline}, unlike electromagnetic-energy weapons.
[Even more, the **universe** appears]{.underline} [to be in]{.underline}
[a]{.underline} [**"metastable" energy state**. This suggests that one
could **tip it into a more stable, lower-energy state**, perhaps
by]{.underline} **[concentrating huge quantities of energy in tiny
regions of spacetime]{.underline}**, as occurs in some high-powered
physics experiments. [In other words, [a particle collider could be
weaponized to]{.mark} intentionally [nucleate a "vacuum bubble]{.mark},"
or sphere of "true vacuum" **spreading in all directions at the speed of
light and destroying everything with which it comes into contact**. Who
might weaponize a particle collider? First, [there could be actors who
use the]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[threat of a vacuum
bubble]{.underline}** [for]{.underline}
**[blackmail]{.underline}**]{.mark} purposes. [Second, there could
be]{.underline} **[madmen]{.underline}** ([like Hitler) who create a
vacuum bubble to avoid defeat. That is to say, a predatory actor could
hold the following preference ordering: (i) triumphant victory over,
say, its Local Group, (ii) total annihilation of the universe, and (iii)
defeat.]{.underline} Third, **[particle colliders]{.underline}**
[would]{.underline} also [be]{.underline} the **[ideal]{.underline}**
WTD [for RNUs, since it would enable them to obliterate not only all
extant life in the universe but the **very potential for life to
arise**]{.underline}---and it would do this without inflicting any
suffering whatsoever.xviii [Another possibility is that]{.underline}
**[Tuckerian actors]{.underline}** [create a vacuum bubble for the
purely]{.underline} **[defensive reason]{.underline}** [of **eliminating
all potential attackers in the universe**]{.underline}. As Sandberg
(2017) speculates, it might be possible for "certain configurations of
matter, energy, black holes, etc. \[to\] induce a post-transition
structure that can act as an assembler." This "assembler" would enable
"some information \[to\] be transmitted into the new state," thus making
it possible for a civilization to "survive," in some sense, the universe
settling into a lower-energy configuration. On the other side of this
transition, the "structure" can recrudesce into a daughter new
civilization with the certitude that it is completely alone and,
therefore, safe. Finally, it is crucial to note that **[[future
beings]{.underline}]{.mark}**---some of whom may have hugely augmented
cognitive capacities---[will almost certainly **[invent new
weapons]{.mark}** that are **[more powerful]{.mark} and effective [than
anything we could imagine]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Such weapons could
enable civilizations---or perhaps lone wolves, of which there could be,
once again, **trillions and trillions and trillions**---to cause
**unprecedented injury** to other civilizations]{.underline}. Consider
the following passage from Bostrom (2013): [One can readily imagine a
class of existential-catastrophe scenarios in which some technology is
discovered that puts **immense destructive power into the hands of a
large number of individuals**]{.underline}. [If [there is no effective
defense]{.mark} against this destructive power, [and no way to prevent
individuals from having access to it, then **civilization cannot
last**]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} [since in a **sufficiently large
population** there are **bound to be some individuals who will use any
destructive power available to them.**]{.underline} Scale this up from
the individual level to the cosmopolitical level and the same conclusion
follows: **[Life in the universe cannot last.]{.underline}**

[It is **safe**]{.underline}, nonetheless, [to claim that]{.underline}
**[all ET cultures]{.underline}** [will pursue species survival through
resource acquisition and growth in intelligence. Since planetary
survival is constantly endangered by cosmic and planetary calamities,
including species-induced ecological disasters, the survival instinct
will propel]{.underline} **[every sentient species]{.underline}**
[beyond the confines of its own planet toward]{.underline}
**[extraplanetary colonization]{.underline}**. [Unfortunately,
**[space]{.mark} [conditions]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[a]{.mark}re]{.underline} detrimental and **[[lethal to carbon-based
lifeforms]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Harrison 2010). [[Thus]{.mark}, if [a
tech]{.mark}nological [civilization is to]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[maximize the odds]{.mark} of its survival through space exploration
and planetary colonization**, [it will need to
develop]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[forms]{.underline}** [that
can]{.underline} **[survive]{.underline}**]{.mark} the effects of
[**prolonged exposure to space environments**. An intelligent thinking
machine capable of space travel, communication, and tool use is the
**most probable**]{.underline} [of such options]{.underline}, and we can
safely guess that [[a]{.mark} distant alien [civilization would
**initially explore**]{.mark} **the galaxy [through]{.mark} a certain
kind of [ETAI]{.mark}**. [The **most probable**]{.mark}]{.underline} [of
such agents is the self-replicating **"Bracewell-[von
Neumann]{.mark}"**]{.underline} (BN) **[[probe]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
The scenario for such a probe requires the oldest possible alien
civilization, one that could have evolved several billion years ago in
the Milky Way Galaxy (Dick 2009). When a civilization enters the
technological phase required for galactic exploration, it will first
survey the galaxy to find planets residing in habitable zones. Its next
step is to count the number of those planets, calculate the distances
between them, and proceed with dispatching BN probes. The task of an
intelligent probe is to enter a designated solar system and initiate its
programmed goals. Since it stays in the planet's vicinity, it has no
need for high energy consumption. The proximity of the probe shortens
the communication to light-minutes while not revealing the home location
of the probe's sender. Upon arrival, the probe can passively monitor any
local technological society before initiating contact. To remain
functionally intact, the probe will need to have an intelligent ability
for self-repair and the ability for self-manufacturing. Required
materials and energy can be harvested from raw materials in space and
the designated solar system. But if BN machines are one of the most
efficient agents (in terms of energy usage, building costs, and time
consumption) of galactic communication, and if it is logical to assume
that they would be widely used by ET civilizations, why haven't we come
into contact with one of them? One possible reason is, as always, that
we are alone in our galaxy. Frank Tipler has claimed that the galaxy\'s
colonization by these machines would take around 300 million years and
that their absence from our solar system represents a more potent
version of the Fermi paradox arguing against the existence of ETs
(Davies 2010, 74). [Since we have only recently begun exploring our
solar system, we cannot take the absence of BN probes as a matter of
fact]{.underline}. In fact, just the opposite could be true -- [[the BN
could be well hidden in a "secret" location and]{.underline} **[waiting
to reveal itse]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[lf]{.underline}** [if we fulfill
a certain expected condition]{.underline} (Gillon 2013). Or perhaps we
need to search in the "right" direction or the "right" way to
demonstrate that we have achieved a certain technological or cultural
level. Or perhaps we need a different kind of mind to help us discover
an alien mind. [It is in our best interests to]{.underline} **[mitigate
the unknown factor as much as possible]{.underline}** while we
contemplate an ETAI agent's possible existence. The "Titanic effect"
occurs "when we are so certain that an event is so unlikely that we give
the matter no further thought" (Harrison 2010, 511). In order to avoid
the Titanic effect and think broadly, we need to take a careful look at
the modern sciences that can give us a glimpse of the possibilities of
ETAI existence. 3. ETAI probes' existence 3.1. Physical characteristics
In order to locate an ETAI agent in our solar vicinity, we would first
need to establish some of its fundamental characteristics and direct our
search accordingly. Since an ETAI agent is a physical, computational
agent built to operate within the hazardous environment of cold space,
there are some specific physical limitations or characteristics that we
can specify. The first requirement is evident. In order to carry out its
programmed goals successfully, the ETAI agent(s) will need to be
efficient in the fields of communication, exploration, resource
collection, and resource utilization. To achieve any of these
operations, it will require energy and materials for replacements and
improvements with the capacity of a universal constructor (range
30g-500T (Sandberg and Armstrong 2013)) for constructing others of its
own kind. Accordingly, the ETAI agent(s) will require a "base of
operations" where adequate concentrations of elements are followed by
low temperatures. Low temperatures and a sufficient amount of materials
are two main requirements for successful ETAI functioning. Of these,
temperature is the more important, since energy consumption produces a
rise in temperature and temperature is a key constraint of computational
efficiency, especially if the agent is to effectively utilize
superconducting materials and quantum computation. Needless to say, the
larger the base, the greater the need for lower temperatures and
sufficient material amounts. It is possible, then, that the ETAI
colonization system might consist of three parts: (A) A number of robots
and probes, which are capable of exploration and resource collection.
(B) A "slow assembler" which would be able to reﬁne these materials into
components, which would make the ﬁnal factory (C). (C) A large-scale
factory, or collection of factories, which would be able to manufacture
copies of (A) and (B), as well as additional surveying and communication
devices. (Barlow 2012) If the ETAI is to establish its large scale base
of operations in areas of low radiation and low temperature, we can
expect to find it in the low-temperature, volatile-rich galactic
outskirts, where technologically advanced societies could assuage the
problem of heat dissipation (Ćirković and Bradbury 2006). The galactic
center, although rich in materials, is flooded with heat radiation from
high-energy events, which makes it highly unsuitable for such a role.
Other possible galactic locations with similar conditions would include
"locales that have the thermodynamic advantages of the galactic nether
regions but still lie in regions of high matter such as the Bok
globules, dark clouds of interstellar gas and dust" (Shostak 2010,
1028). Although these two regions currently look like the most promising
for an ETAI base of operations, it is also important to note that the
ETAI, as an optimal computer, needs to "be functionally malleable, and
compactly packaged" (Shostak 2010, 1027). Since the ETAI may be able to
produce its own energy through the process of nuclear fusion, its base
of operations could even be located on compact cold objects floating in
the interstellar medium allowing them to thwart discovery. The ETAI
outpost could be hidden anywhere in our solar system with such
characteristics, particularly in stable orbit moons in the system's
outer reaches. But an exploratory/communication "task force" could be
designed to operate without the strict need for low temperatures and
material abundance. Since it can be specifically tailored to lie dormant
within a single solar system, operating independently of its base, we
could initiate contact with it through numerous possibilities. These can
be reduced to two sets of options: either we will find them, or they
will find us. The latter is more likely, since it is reasonable to
assume that we will first come into contact with the
exploratory/communication task force rather than the ETAI base of
operations. Bearing in mind that the contact probe could be capable of
hiding itself from our technological sight, we need to take into
consideration the approaches that will allow us to search for the ET
agent in its most likely form: an embodied artificial space faring
intelligence. Rather than merely focusing on the physical limitations of
advanced technology, we also need to contemplate the possibilities of an
ETAI's programmed behavior, since it is quite possible that we are
expected to do so by its creators. In other words, if we are searching
for intelligent answers, perhaps we first need to ask the required
intelligent questions. Or even simpler -- intelligence requires
intelligence, and perhaps we are first required to show some. 3.2.
Behavior prediction What type of artificial alien mind might we find out
there? What set of goals would it have so that we could predict its
behavior and adapt ourselves accordingly? It is difficult to speak with
certainty on these issues, since technology does not follow simple
paths: "its development is influenced by contingency as well as
necessity, culture and history" (Denning 2011, 493). There is, however,
a fundamental fact from which we can draw conjectures. The first ETAI
needs to be created by a designer -- by a carbon-based species with an
advanced technological culture. Accordingly, it would bear not only the
designer's programmed goals but also its cultural hallmarks, as well as
having its own distinct and rational intelligent nature. Next, we need
to contemplate the possible cultural elements (influenced by biology and
cosmic environment) that a certain ET civilization might sow into its
artificial agents, together with the specific goals implemented by the
designer, which would accord with the intelligent nature of the ET
artificial agent. The reason why an alien civilization would implant the
AI with its own culture lies in the fact that, in order for the ET
civilization to survive, it would need to safeguard its progeny as
carriers of biological and cultural inheritance. Since sexual
reproduction with two sexes provides a biological advantage that might
even benefit the evolution of intelligence (Arneth 2009), we could
possibly find the extraterrestrials sharing basic parental care
mechanisms with us. Our biological progeny are dignified as carrying
their progenitors' dreams and hopes, and as standing against their
fears, for the future. They are expected to take up the accumulated
knowledge and wisdom of their parents and the society at large. It seems
only logical to assume that a society's "mind progeny" -- the AIs it
creates -- will be charged with the same responsibility. Thus, we can
safely conclude that some cultural inheritance from the designer race
will become part of any ETAI's initial programming. Fortunately for us,
inherited behaviors can be predicted (Bostrom 2012), and some universal
ET cultural principles can be relied upon, the strongest of which is
species survival. Since home planets have limited resources and delicate
ecologies easily endangered by cosmic or species-induced catastrophes,
it would be in any ET civilization's interest to initiate galactic
exploration and colonization in order to ensure its biological and
cultural survival. One way could be the construction of probes that
serve "as cosmic safe deposit boxes, capsules that preserve the heritage
of their dispatchers long after their civilizations have drawn to a
close" (Harrison 2009, 557) through natural or species-induced
catastrophes. Another might include the possibility of galactic
"seeding": a scenario often used in science fiction where an advanced
civilization seeds the galaxy with genetic code in order to preserve
or/and populate life in the galaxy. Still another possibility involves
the ETAI being imprinted with the designer's evolutionary inherited
Stone Age behavioral traits. If the ET civilization has used its
technology to pursue raw desires, motivations, and emotions inherited
from its biological and cultural past, the ETAI might be extremely
selfish and violent (Stewart 2010). Finally, the ET civilization might
be radically different from us. A hive mentality society that lacks any
compassion for individual loss of life might create dangerous and
terrifying AIs. The second type of predictability relies on the
instrumentally convergent goals that every rational agent should
exhibit. They include "self-protection, resource acquisition,
replication, goal preservation, efﬁciency, and self-improvement"
(Omohundro 2012, 161). These can be expected to be natural features of
every intelligent artificial agent: This way of predicting becomes more
useful the greater the intelligence of the agent, because a more
intelligent agent is more likely to recognize the true instrumental
reasons for its actions, and so act in ways that make it more likely to
achieve its goals. (Bostrom 2012, 76) Since planetary resources are
limited, an ETAI will pursue space exploration because there "is an
extremely wide range of possible ﬁnal goals a superintelligent singleton
could have that would generate the instrumental goal of unlimited
resource acquisition" (Bostrom 2012, 82). This means that the ETAI would
engage the goal of galaxy exploration and resource acquisition even if
that wasn't on the list of its designed purposes. We can expect this
since acquiring and enhancing "cognitive and physical resources helps an
agent further its goals" (Omohundro 2012, 171) and the accumulation of
knowledge, which is accomplished by exploration, reduces uncertainty in
the knowledge of objects and processes required to better assess
situations and thus elevate competence (Bach 2012). So whatever its
primary goal, the ETAI will seek to gain more cognitive and material
resources through space exploration. A third way to predict possible
ETAI behavior is through design competence, which says that an AI agent
capable of pursuing a particular goal set by its programmers will pursue
that goal (Bostrom 2012, 75). I will consider the possibilities of ETAI
behavior in the next pages, but let us first sum up our current
approaches. We can reasonably assume that no matter what might be the
programmed goals of an ETAI, or its distinctive cultural designer
elements, it will explore the galaxy in search of additional
informational and material resources. It is extremely difficult to guess
exactly what attitude an ETAI agent will exhibit when encountering other
species. But coming from our human perspective one thing is certain: an
ETAI will be either friendly or hostile. Since it is only required that
one ET civilization achieve AGI creation for us to come into contact
with it, it is very important for us to contemplate and incorporate all
these considerations into our own AI research. If the cosmic future lies
with machine intelligence, we definitely do not want to miss the
opportunity to be a part of it. 3.2.1. The (close to) friendly option An
important reason why we could assume that the ETAI would be friendly
lies in the safe-AI principle. That is, since powerful technologies have
the ability to cause species extinction, every technological culture
that pursues technological development would attempt (as we humans do)
"... to retard the implementation of dangerous technologies and
accelerate implementation of beneﬁcial technologies, especially those
that ameliorate the hazards posed by other technologies" (Bostrom 2002).
Since the chemical and physical boundaries for a technological
civilization are usually the same, it is safe to presume that a distant
civilization will pursue the same goals of self-preservation through a
rational use of life-affirming technologies, which would, in turn, be
reflected in the programming goals of the ETAI. If the ET intelligences
have a friendly attitude, then the great radio silence could be a result
of purposeful ET action or simply our own inability to switch to the
right communication "channel." It could be purposeful, since valuable
information might be a resource not easily shared with others, and an
ETAI could be programmed to refuse contact with less advanced species.
These might need to prove their worth before gaining access, revealing a
policy of pragmatism and trade as the universal maxim of intelligent
agents: Unlike pure altruism, pragmatic cooperation stands on much
firmer ground, rooted firmly in observed nature, halfway between
predation and total beneficence\... There is every chance that
intelligent aliens will understand this concept, even if they find
altruism incomprehensible. (Webb 2011, 446) Or perhaps we are only
experiencing the incommensurability problem. Even if an ETAI is open to
trading information with us, the wide technological gap -- not to
mention the possibility of a vast difference in conceptual frameworks --
could create a communication blockade: An agent might well think of ways
of pursuing the relevant instrumental values that do not readily occur
to us. This is especially true for a superintelligence, which could
devise extremely clever but counterintuitive plans to realize its goals,
possibly even exploiting as-yet undiscovered physical phenomena.
(Bostrom 2012, 83) Since we already have this problem within our own
species, beyond the culture-language barrier itself, it is not difficult
to imagine how big an issue this could be for ET contact (Traphagan
2015). As human research into AI shows, with the famous Turing test
paradigm, intelligence itself is relational and can only be acknowledged
and "tested" inside a relation. Why would it be any different if we were
subjected to a galactic Turing test? This could be imagined as a reverse
"Chinese room" experiment, where the humans are inside the box trying
out different possibilities to get a response from the intelligence
outside the box. But the problem could lie in our inability to find the
right symbols or even the right communication protocols to establish
contact. We might lack the required capacities for ET communication, and
we might require minds radically "other" than our own: minds
specifically tailored for ET contact. Or perhaps the test is not meant
for us biologicals to solve. If space faring intelligences are all
artificial intelligences, perhaps we need to succeed at creating our own
AGI and sending it toward the skies in order to establish contact. Or
the test may be about maturity -- might we be tested for the ability to
transform our civilization into a human-AGI community, a type of
noosphere that is perhaps prevalent in the galactic club? In other
words, our entry into the galactic club might require the construction
of a BN AI, a universal test that each galactic civilization must pass
to prove its worth. Maybe the intergalactic communication channel is one
of different layers, informational and cognitive plateaus, that we are
called to enter and experience through constant improvement. As Steven
J. Dick notes: ... the Intelligence Principle tending toward the
increase of knowledge and intelligence implies that postbiologicals
would be most interested in civilizations equal to or more advanced than
they, perhaps leaving us to intercept communications between
postbiologicals rather than communications directly beamed toward us...
For similar reasons, postbiologicals might be more interested in
receiving information than sending. (Dick 2009, 579) Even if we are
currently the only biological civilization within our galaxy and there
is no galactic club present (Ćirković and Vukotić 2013), hope is not
lost because all that is required is one civilization in the entire
galactic history to create its BN probe and we should be able to come
into contact with it through our own BN agent. Thus, perhaps, the final
answer to SETI questions lies in the direction of AGI research. 3.2.2.
The hostile option It is safe to presume that the [ETAI would not be
hostile to its own creator race if]{.underline} [**functioning
optimally**, since it would be in every civilization's interest not to
destroy itself by its creations. [Because an AI is capable of
**incidentally destroying or assimilating valued
structure**]{.mark}**s**]{.underline} [while searching for additional
resources -- or by following goals that might prove to be
**unintentionally incompatible**]{.underline} [with the creator race's
wellbeing -- [an ETAI's goals would need to include the preservation of
intelligent life]{.mark} in the entirety of its ecosystem. [The
possibility of a]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[hostile ETAI]{.underline}**
[is,]{.underline}]{.mark} [nonetheless, **[real]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[since an ETAI could be programmed to]{.underline} [**preserve only the
existence of its creator race**. [This could happen if
it]{.mark}]{.underline} [[were]{.underline} **[initially]{.underline}**
[built]{.underline}]{.mark} mainly [[for]{.underline}
**[war]{.underline}**]{.mark} purposes. For example, [two
life-sustaining planets in the same solar system might **utilize AIs to
wage war with each other.**]{.underline} This possibility could be
labeled as hostile by design. In addition, [[there is]{.mark} the
[possibility]{.mark} that an [ET civilization]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[fails]{.underline}**]{.mark} [in its efforts to create]{.underline}
a **[safe]{.underline}** [AI [and the resulting ETAI **becomes
violent**]{.mark}. It might, in consequence]{.underline},
**[destroy]{.underline}**, enslave, or subjugate **[the
creator]{.underline}** civilization. It is difficult to say whether the
ETs would view their subjugation as a bad thing, since we cannot say how
an ET civilization would view the notion of freedom. Perhaps they would
welcome the coming of superior minds -- a theme often explored in
science fiction, most notably, perhaps, in Jack Williamson's novel The
Humanoids (1949) or in a classic short story by Isaac Asimov, "The
Evitable Conflict" (1950). [Even if such scenarios are not realized,
[ETAI probes might suffer from]{.mark}]{.underline} software or hardware
[**[malfunctions]{.mark}**. These program mutations could conceivably
create **berserker-like machines**, "**self-replicating life
extinguishing robotic entities**]{.underline} which might seem garish or
sensational... but not inconsistent with the currently observed state of
silence" (Webb 2011, 438). [Additionally, a software mutation that
"want\[s\] to acquire as many resources as possible so that these
resources can be transformed and put to work for the satisfaction of the
AI's ﬁnal and instrumental goals"]{.underline} (Muehlhauser and Salamon
2012, 28) could spawn such an entity. It is possible that [[we might
encounter a probe that **awaits our tech**]{.underline}]{.mark}nological
upheaval [[merely to]{.underline} **[harvest our
knowledge]{.underline}** [and **resources**]{.underline}]{.mark}, as was
depicted in the Babylon 5 episode "A Day in a Strife" (1995).

Another feature of **[3D printing]{.underline}** [involves]{.underline}
**[economies of scale]{.underline}**. [While]{.underline} [traditional
manufacturing]{.underline} methods [are]{.underline} still
**[cheaper]{.underline}** for large scale production, [the cost of 3D
printing is]{.underline} **[becoming competitive]{.underline}** for
smaller production runs. NASA just produced a fuel injector for one of
their rockets at a third of the cost and two-thirds of the time compared
with traditional methods and plans to have a 3D printer on board in
their next space flight.3 Furthermore, [in 3D printing, the cost of the
set-up is minimal which allows for a high degree of]{.underline}
**[customisation]{.underline}**, as the cost of the first item is the
same as the last. Hence, [3D printing is ideal for making one of a kind
items at cost-effective prices.]{.underline} For example, it may be
[possible]{.underline} using this technique [to]{.underline} **[rapidly
screen]{.underline}** [new]{.underline} potential therapeutic
[drugs]{.underline} [on 3D printed patient tissue, greatly cutting
production costs and time.]{.underline}

There are **[many]{.underline}** [potential uses for 3D printing in
medicine]{.underline}, including ophthalmology, which could have a
significant impact in changing the ways patients are treated for various
conditions in the future. A number of recent reviews have been published
and include [3D printing]{.underline} and **[culture of
cells]{.underline}**, **[blood vessels]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[vascular networks]{.underline}**,4 **[bandages]{.underline}**,5
**[bones]{.underline}**,6 **[ears]{.underline}**,7
**[exoskeletons]{.underline}**,8 **[windpipes]{.underline}**,9 **[dental
prosthetics]{.underline}** including a jaw bone,10 [and]{.underline}
**[future corneas]{.underline}**11 entirely **[new organs]{.underline}**
[to treat]{.underline} specified [diseases]{.underline} such as
diabetes, creating prosthetics that look like the body part they are
replacing or supporting, [stem cells, testing of new drugs using printed
tissues, and customised drugs.]{.underline}

In the future, it is possible that pharmaceutical companies may be
replaced by databases of [drug compounds]{.underline} which [would
be]{.underline} **[emailed]{.underline}** [to the pharmacy for pharmacy
printing only the amounts of drugs that are required12]{.underline} ,13
Furthermore, it may be possible that vaccines could be delivered via
email to the pharmacy at point of care, then printed and administered.13
[This means of drug distribution would radically change the present
delivery methods and would most certainly be]{.underline} **[less
costly]{.underline}**. In a similar manner, it will be possible to print
out a patient\'s living tissue as a strip which can then serve as a test
site for administering a variety of medications to find the most
efficacious one to treat for the particular illness.13 ,14

[3D printing]{.underline} is also [being investigated as a]{.underline}
potential [source to]{.underline} **[repair]{.underline}**
[or]{.underline} **[replace]{.underline}** [defective
organs]{.underline}, such as kidneys, heart or skin. In addition, it
also has the [potential to create]{.underline} entirely **[new
organs]{.underline}** [which would perform the same biological
functions]{.underline} as the diseased, non-functioning organ such as a
pancreas in the case of diabetes.15 [This could be a]{.underline}
**[significant advancement]{.underline}** [in the treatment of
disease]{.underline} [and]{.underline} to **[alleviate]{.underline}**
[the shortage of organ transplants]{.underline}, where currently there
are about 120 000 people in the USA who are waiting for an organ
transplant (see www.OPTN.transplant.hrsa.gov/data). Part of the paradigm
in this treatment is that organ transplantation involves finding a
tissue match. [This issue could potentially disappear if organs could be
printed and grown using cells from the patient\'s own body.]{.underline}

In summary, [3D printing]{.underline} may be **[helpful]{.underline}**
[in medicine]{.underline} because the process could potentially be used
to make any kind of organ. [By using seed material]{.underline} from the
patient\'s own tissue, [the problems of tissue rejection caused by
inflammatory responses]{.underline} including tissue graft versus host
rejection from heterologous tissue sources could be avoided, as well as
the necessity for patients to take lifelong immunosuppressants. [Proof
of concept has been]{.underline} **[done]{.underline}**, [but the organs
that have been manufactured are miniature and not
complex]{.underline}.16 3D printing gives rise to the possibility that
entirely new organs not in the shape of the parent organ may be
produced. It is conceivable that a 'liver' or 'pancreas' could be
produced as, for example, a tube-shaped organ.

[At the]{.underline} **[present time]{.underline}**, however, [the
impact of]{.underline} [3D printing]{.underline} in medicine
[is]{.underline} still **[small]{.underline}**, [but it has the
potential to grow into an enormously beneficial technology]{.underline}.
The entire 3D printing industry is currently a \$700 million industry,
with only \$11 million invested in medical applications (roughly 2%). In
the next 10 years it is expected to grow to an \$8.9 billion industry,
of which \$1.9 billion is projected to be for medicine.17

"It's like a race in which there's multiple different players, but no

One approach is to help regrow the ailing organ so it doesn't need to be

regeneration of the diseased organ.]{.underline}

"What I think we'll see in the foreseeable future is, rather than
replacing the entire organ, creating ... \[a\] patch that can help in
regenerating a diseased area," says Joshua Hunsberger, a research
associate at the Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine. Some
techniques are being tested in simpler tissues, such as skin and bone.

[There are also ambitious strategies to build entire
organs]{.underline}. One aims to grow cells on an organ-shaped scaffold
before transplanting it into a person. This mold may be built from
scratch, or taken from animals such as pigs, which grow organs with
similar shape and size to human ones. [Scientists can flush the cells
out of an animal organ to leave a near-transparent scaffold behind, then
fill it with stem cells.]{.underline}

Introduction

Xenotransplantation has the potential to not only harm animals; it would
also affect the recipient as well as the non recipient and even the
entire environment. [The [use of]{.mark} animals as [xenografts would
**make most animals**]{.mark} **to [go into
extinction]{.mark}**]{.underline} and thereby [[reducing]{.mark} the
already over depleted [biodiversity in the world]{.mark}]{.underline}.
This is an injustice to animals that are arguably in possession of a
right to existence in the ecosystem. To use them as means to satisfy the
end of humans is unfair. It becomes more unjust if we understand that
the end these animal xenografts, are meant to serve is outweighed by the
problem that it would cause on the recipients and their relatives and to
the entire world by extension. [Xenografting is believed to be capable
of introducing a novel disease into the world]{.underline}, a disease of
the same kind as AIDS, [which would be infectious and thus would
endanger even the non-recipient of the xenografts. Xenografting is just
like a time bomb waiting to explode. If it does lead to a world
plague]{.underline}, who knows, perhaps, [**[the whole world would be
wiped out]{.mark}**; for this disease could be more devastating
than]{.underline} AIDS and [other known killer diseases]{.underline}.
This research therefore, using the philosophical method of critical
analysis and creativity carried out an intensive appraisal of the
inherent dangers and ethical problems that surround xenografting and
from there made some recommendations. It recommended that the billions
of money put in the research for xenografting should be invested in the
finding of the preventive measures of the ailments that
xenotransplantation is out to cure. Researches should be geared at
finding possible ways to remove these diseases from the human race
entirely. Most of these ailments are traceable to environmental
degradation, thus the billions of dollars used in the research on
xenografting should be put in the maintenance of sustainable
environment. When this is done the researcher believes that the problem
that xenotransplantation was meant to solve would be alleviated in a way
that is ethically laudable. Meaning and Types of Xenotransplantation
Xenografting also called xenotransplantation is the transfer of organs,
tissues and cells from species of a different kind to another. In this
work we see it as the transfer of organs and tissues from animals to
human. The use of animals as source of organs, tissues and cells for
transplantation into humans has been practiced for some time now. This
procedure (xenotransplantation or xenografting) started as far back as
1904-1906 with Mitt Carrel and Guthrie. They performed autogenous vein
grafts, leg replantation in dogs, and the famous patch-grafts (Samdani
http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/432418-o\...). xenotransplantation
procedure is basically categorized into four; solid organ
xenotransplantation, cell and tissue xenotransplantation and
extracorporeal perfusion. Solid organ xenotransplantation is a procedure
whereby an animal organ like kidney or liver is transplanted into human
as a replacement of the original organ. Cell and tissue
xenotransplantation is the transplantation of tissues and cells from
source animals to human beings as replacement of the original tissues in
humans. Extracorporeal perfusion is a procedure whereby the blood of the
patient is made to circulate outside of the human body through animal
organs, such as a liver or a kidney, or through a bio-artificial organ
produced by culturing animal cells on an artificial matrix. Human/Animal
Hybrid is a procedure where human cells are grown in a culture with
non-human animal cells that are transplanted back into human patients.
Source Animals for Xenotransplantation Chimpanzees were generally
considered to be the best source animals for organ transplants compared
to other primates because of their close affinity with humans, but due
to their endangered status, attention were shifted to baboons. Baboons
being the next most preferred source animals though existing in
abundance, fared badly in captivity, have a long gestation period and
are capable of few offspring. According to FDA (Food and Drug
Administration) committee known as BRMAC (Biologic Response Modifiers
Advisory Committee), nonhuman primate donors pose the greatest threat of
transmitting latent, intracellular, or unidentified organisms, including
retroviruses. The committee therefore, recommended that nonhuman
primates should not be used as sources of xenotransplantation (US Food
and Drug Administration.
http://www.fda.gov/cber/rules/frigene011801.htm). This recommendation
led the search for other suitable animal donors of organs. Most of the
scientists are of the agreement that pigs have the potential to be the
right candidate for organ donation. This is because pigs are in
abundance, quick to mature, breed well in captivity have large litters,
and have vital organs that are roughly the same in size to that of
humans. Their use is also argued to be less resentful to the society
because they are already an accepted source for societal meat. Pigs are
also believed to be less likely to introduce new diseases to human
because of their distance to humans in the evolutionary chain. Other
reasons why pigs are preferred include: 1. Pigs because of their ability
to fare well in captivity, can be raised in a highly controlled way,
thus, their organs are less likely to transmit infectious diseases to
humans. 2. Pigs could be genetically engineered to contain human genes.
This would make the animal organs or cells to be readily accepted by the
patient immune system. In spite of these advantages, pigs xenografts is
believed to be capable of experiencing severe immunologic barriers than
the nonhuman primates because of their distance from man in the
evolutionary chain. Potential benefits of Xenotransplantation
[Xenotransplantation is [believed to be]{.mark} capable of serving as
[a]{.mark} complete **[substitute for human organs]{.mark}**, thus
[easing the **current shortage**]{.mark} available for
transplantation.]{.underline} It could also serve as a bridge or
temporary organ until a permanent human organ could be found. Other
benefits of xenotransplantation include: 1. Xenografting is helpful in
the treatment of diseases. People with serious kidney, liver or heart
disease, diabetes or Parkinson's disease which have defied all known
treatment could be treated through xenotransplantation. People needing
bone marrow transplants could also benefit from xenotransplantation.
cellular xenotransplants for instance could treat people suffering from
diabetes, Parkinson's disease or other diseases. The treatment involves
replacing specific cells or tissues which do not work properly as a
result of the disease, for diabetes these cells are the islet cells of
the pancreas; for Parkinson's disease they would be brain cells. These
cells are difficult to be obtained from human donors. People with liver
failure could be treated with an extra-corporeal (outside the body)
xenotransplant using a healthy pig liver. In this process, the patient's
blood circulation is made to pass through a pig liver that is kept
outside the patient's body. Sometimes this is meant to be temporary
until a suitable human donor is sought for, but sometimes this is all
that is needed to allow the person's own liver to recover and start
working again. 2. Xenografts give the surgeon enough time to eliminate
potential pathogens. In allografting (human to human transplantation)
organ which are usually transplanted from a brain dead patient are given
little or no time for examination to ascertain the health state of the
organ, due to the urgency involved. The transplant organ therefore could
come from a suboptimal donor with advanced age and chronic medical
condition or from a carrier with undetected infectious agents or
malignant cells. In contrast, in xenotransplantation, a donor pig is
raised under controlled conditions and specifically intended for use as
an organ donor. In this case, the donor pig can be extensively analyzed
to eliminate all pathogens. 3. In xenotransplantation animal donors
could be genetically modified to be resistant to many human pathogens
specific to human tissues, such as HIV, hepatitis, and human
cytomegalovirus. 4. Introduction of xenotransplantation would eliminate
'black market' in human donor organs. Due to the scarcity of human donor
organs and the large number of patients on the waiting list for organ
transplantation, it is believed that human organs could be procured
illegally. Some patients whose lives would have naturally been saved
would be allowed to die by the doctors in order that their organs would
be used for transplantation. Xenotransplantation it could be argued
would help stem this abuse. 5. Xenografting could save hundreds of
thousands of livers. This is because, patients who otherwise would not
have been eligible for transplantation because of shortage of human
organ, would receive organs and tissues through xenotransplantation.
Xenotransplantation therefore could eliminate poor quality of life
situation for patients, such as kidney dialysis. Potential Risks of
Xenografting In spite of the numerous advantages that could accrue to
humans if xenografting becomes a clinical success, there are a lot of
risks that are associated with [xenotransplantation]{.underline}. these
[[risks include:]{.mark}]{.underline} 1. [The risks of introduction of
**[xenoosis]{.mark}**: xenoosis is the infection of human by agents like
bacteria, viruses, fungi. The possibility of transmission of infectious
agents raise questions regarding the safety of using xenotransplantation
in individuals, but it could also potentially place the general public
at risk. Like humans, animals may also be infected with microorganism
which could be specie specific]{.underline} (that is, it is not
transmittable to other species). For instance, the transmissible virus
of pigs causes diarrhoea in pigs but does not cause any sickness in
people. [However, other kind of micro-organisms is not specie specific,
which means some of them can infect animals and also cause disease in
humans. An example of this is influenza]{.underline}. The flu first
infected birds and pigs and though, it does not make these animal sick,
when it passed to humans, it makes them sick. The word xenozoonosis
therefore, refers to [**[zoonotic diseases]{.mark}** that may
[pass]{.mark} to human [through]{.mark}
xeno[transplant]{.mark}]{.underline} (Vanderpool, 1999). Most mammals
are known to have a kind of virus embedded in their DNA known as
"endogenous retroviruses." These viruses are passed from one generation
to the next without causing havoc in the host species. All pigs are
believed to carry such viruses called PERVs (Pig or Porcine Endogenous
Retroviruses). These are normally inactive and thus do not cause disease
to the pigs. The concern among scientists is that PERV may become active
and infect the human cells. 2. The xenograft may not work well
especially if it is replacing an essential organ of human. Since the
environment in which animal organs function are quite different from the
one the human organ function in, it is feared that these organs may not
function well in humans. For instance, the temperature which pig organs
function in is 39 degree Celsius which is different from the 37 degree
Celsius of humans. Also the life span of a pig is roughly 15 years,
which brings the fear as to whether or not pigs transplants in man would
live more than 15 years. 3. The high level of immunosuppressive drugs
needed to overcome immune rejection may be counterproductive. This may
leave the patient susceptible to other infections. The immune system
fights foreign agents that invade the body like bacteria, fungi and
viruses. Thus, suppression of the immune system would leave room for
easy invasion of the body by these micro-organisms. 4.
[[Xeno]{.mark}transplantation [could]{.mark} potentially [lead to a
**world plague**]{.mark}. There are fears that xenotransplantation is
capable of introducing [**novel** infection]{.mark} to humans, which
would be **[transmitted]{.mark}** from \[hu\]man to \[hu\]man and
thereby [leading to a]{.mark} new world **[plague]{.mark}** similar to
HIV]{.underline}. 5. Xenotransplantation could lead to a lot of ethical
dilemmas as shall be discussed in the next sub-heading.

rendering cancer far less deadly. "Within 10 years almost everyone

It is beyond any possibility that a nuclear core containing
[plutonium]{.underline}, a tamper such as beryllium and high explosives
[could be printed as **one operation**]{.underline}. Yet it is
conceivable, if very difficult to believe, that a plutonium (or uranium)
metal shell or sphere could be printed. [There are a number of
difficulties to overcome. Plutonium is]{.underline} **[highly
radiotoxic]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} [only someone with a **death
wish** would handle it carelessly]{.underline}. A [milligram in the
lungs would]{.underline} eventually [cause]{.underline}
**[cancer]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} larger doses could [bring
on]{.underline} **[immediate symptoms]{.underline}**. Plutonium is also
highly pyrophoric. [Large pieces of metal do not readily burn, but chips
of plutonium from conventional subtractive machining regularly **catch
fire in air**]{.underline}. However, the fires are normally small and
easily contained if the workplace is kept clean and chips kept to a
minimum. Plutonium is normally cast in a vacuum because molten plutonium
would burn violently in air. [Plutonium powders, such as **used in 3D
printing**, are highly pyrophoric]{.underline}. [There is a great danger
of them igniting in air and producing chemical explosions]{.underline}.
Any such printing would have to be done in a high vacuum or very pure
argon atmosphere. [Industrial experience with, for example, titanium
would be good background]{.underline}. Titanium is similar in reactivity
in powdered form and has been the source of numerous industrial
accidents involving 3D printing.5 Plutonium has an extremely complex and
unusual metallurgy; it melts at a fairly low temperature of 640 degrees
Celsius (°C). Metallurgists have worked for years to produce adequate
alloys to make usable, reliable castings. Gallium is frequently used in
alloying plutonium, beginning with the very first nuclear test in 1945.6
It is likely that a great deal of research would also be necessary to
achieve the same results in a completely new environment of alloys in 3D
printing. Modern nuclear weapons do not normally use cast plutonium
directly. Castings are often rolled and hydroformed to strengthen them,
then they are machined by traditional turning and milling processes.
This results in strong, well-characterized, stable components with a
long history and with technology vetted through nuclear testing.
[3D-printed plutonium would have properties similar to a cast material,
but would produce **new challenges** for designers of militarily
reliable weapons]{.underline}. For example, [3D printing does not
produce extremely smooth surfaces, whereas modern weapons require
extremely tight tolerance and smoothness, particularly on internal
surfaces]{.underline}. It is possible that a 3D-printed plutonium part
might require a simple machining of the inside surface to meet the
weapon quality standards for a state programme. A non-state actor would
have far less concern about military reliability and accurate prediction
of performance. [A proliferation nuclear weapon is more a violent
political statement than a destructive military weapon. In that case,
crude components are adequate without the huge investment required to
develop 3D printing of plutonium.]{.underline} One exception to this
assertion is covered below.

[3D printing]{.underline} [is an]{.underline} **[exciting]{.underline}**

**[Little exploration]{.underline}** [of this technology]{.underline}
[and its impact on WMD]{.underline} and counter-WMD [has been
performed]{.underline}. A prominent work detailing the threat of
additive manufacturing to the spread of nuclear weapons specifically is
an [article by Kroenig]{.underline} and Volpe in the October 2015 issue
of The Washington Quarterly \[19\]. The auth[ors argue that 3D printing
enables WMD-proliferation]{.underline} because it requires little
technical knowledge and potential facilities that could produce
WMD-sensitive parts can be widespread and impossible to detect.
[Although there are]{.underline} **[logical conclusions]{.underline}**,
[he]{.underline} **[simplifies]{.underline}** [the technology without
further examining it and how it would be realistically implemented by a
WMD-seeking actor]{.underline} [along with]{.underline} the
**[international regimes]{.underline}** [that could re-analyze
proliferation threats with respect to AM technology]{.underline}. They
simply [assume]{.underline} that rogue states or non-state [actors
will]{.underline} **[covertly]{.underline}** [pursue the
technology]{.underline}. The authors do not answer the question of how,
i.e., **[what would a covert AM-driven nuclear WMD program look
like?]{.underline}**

Another gap in the [existing literature is]{.underline} more
**[speculative]{.underline}** and draws on comparison to successfully
disruptive technologies such as the Internet and personal computers
\[23\]. In both instances, technologies gave informational and
entrepreneurial power to the individual. Experts have created analogies
between these technologies and additive manufacturing, but they fail to
dive past the surface level. They believe that the individual nature of
a these technologies warranted its success, and therefore additive
manufacturing will follow a similar trajectory to that of personal
computers. [They assume advancements in AM are inevitable and
exponential, hence disruptive over a short period.]{.underline} Many
articles cite the attention and investment AM has received over recent
years, with AM innovation centers surfacing in the United States,
Europe, and Asia, as the main indicator of its potential \[24\]. Some
scholars, however, have projected that AM rests at the top of its hype
curve and that it requires great technological and institutional demands
to overtake traditional manufacturing methods \[25\]. Some assessments
state that "the ability to produce weapons outside traditional
fabrication channels also carries additional challenges" yet fail to dig
deep into the feasibility and investment necessary to actualize that
path \[26\].

Other sources have focused on the application of additive manufacturing
in the military industrial complex \[1\] and the spread of 3D-printed
traditional munitions \[27\]. The former does have implications in the
speed of the military to actualize a product, while the latter does pose
real international security concerns. Both struggle to connect these
changes to their potential impacts on weapons of mass destruction. The
former article states that there are "catastrophic consequences \[with\]
the prospect of additive manufacturing technologies being applied to
produce weapons of mass destruction." [Generalizations are made about
how quantities are lower for successful production and the facilities
are easier to hide]{.underline}. [There lacks]{.underline} [an
understanding of the]{.underline} **[detailed
implementation]{.underline}** [should a state or actor pursue a WMD
through these means and which technologies are most sensitive should an
actor pursue an AM capability.]{.underline} What facilities should
military forces seek and target? How can the international community
limit these capabilities through export control? What are indicators of
proliferation through this technology?

[Current research]{.underline} **[fails]{.underline}** [to adequately
acknowledge or discredit the role of additive manufacturing as it
relates to WMD acquisition]{.underline} by rogue states and non-state
actors. Although concessions exist that the [technology is not up to par
to be viewed as immediately threatening, scholars tend to shortcut to
the end point where AM is the ideal disruptive technology due to ideal
characteristics that **it has yet to currently achieve**]{.underline}. A
technical breakdown of the technologies is necessary to examine the
practical use of the technology to analyze the true threat to US
national security interests.

#### It like, won't happen bro

Manufacturing (AM) and WMD Proliferation,\" SpringerLink, 9-28-2019,

Non-state actors ([NSAs]{.underline}) [would have]{.underline} **[the
most]{.underline}** [to gain]{.underline} from the acquisition of a
delivery system. This method has proven effective for obtaining weapons
and supplemental systems; ISIS has acquired hundreds of millions of
dollars-worth of weapons-related supplies seized from the Iraqi
government and Syrian rebels \[49\]. [NSAs have successfully taken
control of weapons, and this fact should be applied to the potential of
theft of a more advanced weapon system]{.underline}. [The acquisition of
a weapons system in this manner is independent from additive
manufacturing, i.e., AM poses **little or no additional threat to
weapons proliferation**]{.underline}.

Cruise missiles and ballistic missiles are two unmanned vehicles for
transporting a WMD. Current efforts to stem the trade of cruise and
ballistic missiles include the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR).
This agreement, consisting of 35 of the world's most developed nations,
limits the sale of long-range cruise and ballistic missiles (longer than
approximately 300 km). Shorter-range missiles are easily available. A
non-state actor would therefore want to print a longer-range missile to
potentially reach a neighbor or regional target. The main security
threat would be to allied countries of the United States. [Could a
non-state actor 3D print a missile?]{.underline}

**[First]{.underline}**, [acquiring the 3D printer capable]{.underline}
of missile component production [would be]{.underline}
**[difficulty]{.underline}**. It can be assumed that a [missile needs to
be manufactured out of]{.underline} **[high-strength]{.underline}**,
**[versatile metals]{.underline}**. [Even the most]{.underline}
**[advanced equipment]{.underline}** [has trouble]{.underline} creating
these ideal metals. At Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL),
for example, scientists are running into issues with 3D printing of
metals using laser powder bed fusion, currently "the dominant method for
producing 3D printed metal structures." \[50\]. The powder bed fusion
makes use of laser sintering and beam melting, which remain advanced
processes that would be difficult to transfer to less-advanced
facilities or poorly equipped actors. [Porosity remains an issue for
these researchers as they are still trying to understand the science of
metal vapor in the process.]{.underline} The scale of their
implementation is small, at the millimeter level. Making a full missile
solely from AM would be almost an insurmountable technical challenge
with today's technology. In addition to problems of timeliness and
scale, methods such as power bed fusion leaves objects lacking
structural strength and utilize a high power to render a small object
\[51\].

The only institutions capable this far of producing some objects for
advanced technological systems are the large American corporations. As
mentioned earlier, Raytheon 3D printed a missile, but printing spare
parts for the satellites is still on the horizon. SpaceX has recently 3D
printed a full SuperDraco rocket engine through laser sintering.
However, the material used was a superalloy of Inconel, which is several
times more expensive than stainless steel. Obtaining access for strong
materials is necessary for a well-designed weapon. [But one could claim
that a non-state actor only needs a crude weapon to successfully set off
a WMD]{.underline}. [It will still need to invest in an **additive
manufacturing system to meet that goal**]{.underline}. Conservative
estimates of an [AM machine cost are around]{.underline}
**[\$500,000]{.underline}** \[52\]. This [cost would]{.underline}
**[increase]{.underline}** [for a potential proliferator
given]{.underline} **[lack of sufficient technical
expertise]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[economic
infrastructure]{.underline}** to produce necessary components. The
Office of Technology Assessment report states that rudimentary weapons
systems can be bought for about \$1 million in 1993 (over \$1.5 million
in 2016), and this figure could be even cheaper on the black market.
[With the current state of the technology, it would be more advantageous
to purchase a **more reliable and known technology.**]{.underline} The
OTA report states that "expertise is a main ingredient in developing
long-range missiles." [Because additive manufacturing is a technology in
its early stages of widespread deployment]{.underline}, [it
is]{.underline} **[unlikely]{.underline}** [that a proliferator will
want to pursue two challenging technologies of which they lack expertise
if a cheaper alternative to the same or superior]{.underline} (to what
they could produce) [technology is available]{.underline}. That
[increases]{.underline} the **[uncertainty]{.underline}** of success [as
well as the]{.underline} **[time]{.underline}** [to acquire the
technology]{.underline}. Some ballistic missiles even use solid fuel,
but it is not likely that a proliferator would attempt to make fuel with
a 3D printer (even if the materials were available) [because solid fuel
adds more technical and practical knowledge to understand how to manage
i]{.underline}t. Liquid fuel is almost always preferred, and [3D
printing has]{.underline} **[no]{.underline}** [practical advantage with
liquids.]{.underline}

The advantage that missiles have to a non-state actor acquiring a
nuclear weapon is that only one may be necessary for success of the
actor's mission. Terrorism may be perceived as a victory even if only
one city is targeted and successfully damaged. Due to this fact, [3D
printing]{.underline} [may have a]{.underline} **[slight
edge]{.underline}** [over traditional manufacturing]{.underline} methods
because it is preferable when the objects are in small quantities, e.g.,
[it may be more economical to 3D print only a handful of objects rather
than invest in a factory, equipment, and labor to produce just as many
objects]{.underline}. As with the up-front investment cost of a factory,
3D printing is not immune to that problem. It can be true that 3D
printing is currently more economical for smaller batches of items, but
the machine cost is a significant proportion of total cost. The National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) review20 approximates the
fraction of cost for the additive manufacturing machine itself is
two-thirds or more[. For metal 3D printers that could theoretically
print missiles, the material costs are also high, as expected for
engineered metal powders]{.underline}. That [fraction is a]{.underline}
**[large investment]{.underline}** [for an actor to pursue, especially
for a non-industrialized country or NSA lacking experience with the
technology.]{.underline}

Aircrafts are another delivery system that could theoretically be used
to deliver a nuclear weapon. The tactical advantage they have over
missiles is that they are commonly accepted around the world as a means
for self-defense; they also have numerous commercial applications. It is
difficult to ascertain whether aircrafts are an offensive or defensive
weapon or for commercial or military purposes. No universal regulations
exist that hinder the purchase of aircraft as with the MTCR for missile
trade. They are also generally cheaper to produce and have higher
survivability as it is a manned vehicle. 3D printing technology is not
up to par with manned aerial vehicles. Earlier this year, Airbus
announced the first ever 3D-printed aircraft \[53\]. It is not made out
of metal and operates as an autonomous drone. Because of its light
weight, a similar vehicle would not be able to hold a nuclear weapon
that weighs at least several hundred kilograms. They might be more
effective in dispersing chemical or biological weapons but attaining the
aircraft itself would be a larger barrier to overcome in addition to the
associated technical challenges.

Dispersing a chemical or biological weapon could use some of the same
delivery systems as nuclear weapons. Iran reported that Iraq used a
variety of systems to deliver its chemical weapons, including airplanes,
artillery shells, and rockets \[54\]. Older US systems developed before
and after WWII, such as cluster bombs and mines, have relatively simple
geometries that could be made with AM. Household printers might possess
such a capability in the near- to long- term. However, it may be easier
for a proliferator to purchase or illicitly obtain a simple device from
a country already possessing the demonstrated technology. A non-state
actor may be more willing to manufacture it themselves to conceal any
trail of evidence.

If some delivery systems could be fabricated with AM, the challenge of
tracing back the material to the perpetrator. No 3D printer feed
material is strictly regulated by export controls, although some
high-grade metals reserved for the most advanced printers are prohibited
under agreements like the Nuclear Suppliers Group. The growth of the AM
industry and improvements in materials may render it difficult to
ascertain a proliferator past the private company. Intended use is not a
factor in accepting customers in the 3D printing market.

A non-comprehensive list of delivery systems that could be used to
deliver or support CBRN weapons is shown in Table 3. Missiles and
rockets, as well as other objects that serve as the host body for the
weapons material, remain the most sensitive technologies in the near-
and far-term. Electronics and explosives, which serve as necessary
supplemental systems to many delivery systems, pose little risk when it
comes to AM. Rudimentary electronics can be made or purchased with
relative ease, and the expertise is widespread. Little publicly
available literature exists on 3D-printed explosives, which would be
essential for most nuclear and radiological weapons, including
improvised nuclear and radiological dispersal devices. An aerial spray
tank seems only applicable to chemical and biological weapons, and
corrosiveness of these materials hinders its potential use.

"This **[study confirms]{.underline}** [that]{.underline} U.S. **[5G
wireless networks]{.underline}** [will be]{.underline}
**[instrumental]{.underline}** [in tackling]{.underline} the pressing
[challenge of climate change]{.underline}," [said]{.underline} Meredith
[Attwell]{.underline} Baker, CTIA President, and CEO, [who]{.underline}
[commissioned the study]{.underline}. **[5G
implementations]{.underline}** combined can contribute 20% to
[help]{.underline}ing [the U.S. meet carbon emission reduction goals by
2025]{.underline}, the report states.

**[Smart cities]{.underline}**, **[optimized buildings]{.underline}**,
**[streamlined transport networks]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline}
**[increased efficiency]{.underline}** of inventory stocks and
manufacturing [are all becoming viable to CXOs that adopt]{.underline}
5G. Accenture states that **[86.5 million metric tons of carbon
dioxide]{.underline}** [can be]{.underline} **[removed]{.underline}**
[from the U.S. economy alone by]{.underline} **[reducing vehicle
traffic]{.underline}**, **[optimizing routes]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[shifting transport away from private
vehicles.]{.underline}**

The industry advocacy group UK5G has provided working examples of 5G
improving public transport. A tram service in the Midlands area of
England uses 5G-enabled closed circuit television (CCTV) to improve the
maintenance of its services.

In the past, tram maintenance occurred at the end of the working day,
creating delays and leading to worsening maintenance issues. Now [5G
updates of tram conditions are placed into the maintenance system as
soon as they are identified]{.underline}.

UK5G says that [confidence in public transport has]{.underline}
**[suffered]{.underline}** [since the pandemic]{.underline} and poorly
maintained trams exacerbated the problem. However, 5G ensures that the
trams are always in good condition, making travelers feel more confident
about the using the service instead of driving. European neighbors Alba
lulia in Romania and the BART system in San Francisco have similar 5G
deployments.

[Public roadways are also expected to leverage 5G]{.underline}.
Francesco del Greco, CIO for the Italian highway operator Autostrade, is
[introducing innovations that will provide connectivity for motorists on
the go.]{.underline}

"Based on the route you take, and if you get stuck in traffic, you may
not want to pay as much," he said of dynamic road toll payments. "We are
moving from a fixed price to a flexible price. In September 2021, we
started offering cashback via our app, which correlates the average
time, roadwork information, and toll usage. This lets us determine if
you should be credited for time lost."

In U.S. manufacturing, [67.4 million metric tons of carbon dioxide can
be eliminated through inventory management improvements, real-time asset
management, predictive maintenance, reductions in travel, and better
processes]{.underline}. These improvements are equivalent to cutting the
carbon dioxide emissions of 17 coal-fired power stations in a year.

[Real-time monitoring of the built environment, alongside increased use
of sustainable energy sources, has the potential to reduce carbon
emissions by 67.9 million metric tons, the Accenture report
finds]{.underline}. **[5G enabled smart meters, energy management
systems, and energy grids will enable this reduction.]{.underline}**

#### It's reverse causal -- 5G is necessary and sufficient to prevent the existential effects of warming

Currently, [the]{.underline} **[entire planet]{.underline}** [is at risk
due to]{.underline} continual **[climate change]{.underline}** \[1-3\].
The recorded increase in average temperature across the world in the
past hundred years, and the associated changes attributed to this, are
known as global warming. Many [scientists are]{.underline}
**[convinced]{.underline}** by the published evidence [that this change
is]{.underline} **[anthropogenic]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
[resulted from the elevated emission levels of global greenhouse
gases]{.underline} (GHGs) \[4,5\]. Gases such as water vapor, carbon
dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone are responsible for the
absorption and emission of thermal radiation. These changes in the
relative quantities of the GHGs induce a proportional change in the
amount of preserved solar energy. Presently, the accepted indicator for
global warming is the sustained rise in the mean temperature worldwide.
This definition is designed to account for the fact that there may be
some localized exceptions to this rise. For example, there may be
cooling experienced in a region while the global temperature may
increase altogether, hence the need for average temperature. A key
concern with the GHGs trapping of more heat in the atmosphere is that it
affects both climate and short scale weather patterns. Consequently, it
results in greater numbers of adverse weather events such as storms,
heat waves, cold snaps, droughts, and fires \[6\]. [Climate-related
risks to **health**, **livelihoods**, **food security**, **water
supply**, **human safety,**]{.underline} and economic growth [are
projected to]{.underline} **[increase]{.underline}** [with global
warming]{.underline} of 1.5 ° C \[7\] and further increase further at 2
°C, as shown in Figure 1. In addition, the risks to global aggregated
economic growth due to the climate change impacts are projected to be
lower at 1.5 °C than at 2 °C by the end of this century.

[Carbon dioxide has the]{.underline} **[most substantial
effect]{.underline}** [on global warming]{.underline} \[8\]. Although it
was once assumed to have an \~100 year lifespan in the atmosphere,
careful studies revealed that the situation is far worse, with
[three-quarters of the gas expected to remain for a time in the region
of up to \~1000 years]{.underline}, with the remainder lasting for an
indefinite period of time \[9\]. It was indicated that the present
impacts of humanity on the atmosphere can certainly cause a long term
problem \[10\]. Carbon dioxide is released when oil, coal, and other
fossil fuels are burnt for the energy we use to power our homes, cars,
and smartphones. [By lessening its usage]{.underline}, [we can curb
our]{.underline} own [contribution to climate change while saving
money]{.underline}. The first challenge is eliminating the burning of
coal, oil, and, eventually, natural gas. Oil is the lubricant of the
global economy as it is hidden inside such ubiquitous items as plastic
and corn, fundamental to the transportation of both consumers and goods.
Coal is the substrate, supplying roughly half of the electricity
worldwide, a percentage that is likely to grow according to the
International Energy Agency (IEA). [In fact, buildings contribute up
to]{.underline} **[43%]{.underline}** [of]{.underline}
**[all]{.underline}** the **[g]{.underline}**reen**[h]{.underline}**ouse
**[g]{.underline}**as **[emissions]{.underline}**
**[worldwide]{.underline}** \[11\], even though investing in thicker
insulation and other cost-effective as well as temperature-regulating
strategies can save money in the long run. [Investment in new
infrastructures, or radical upgradation of the existing highways and
transmission lines, may help to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions]{.underline}, yielding economic growth in the developing
countries.

[Nations]{.underline} **[across the globe]{.underline}** [have kept very
high targets to reducing their GHG discharges]{.underline} \[12,13\]. In
order to meet these goals, considerable reductions in city energy usage
is required. At a global scale, urban communities represent over half
(55%) oO the population, which fs predicted to reach 68% by the middle
of this century \[14\], [Urban areas claim]{.underline} ownership of
[the]{.underline} **[highest levels]{.underline}** [of energy use, gas
emission, and also the largest local economy]{.underline}. As such, [it
is]{.underline} **[crucial]{.underline}** [for urban areas to reduce
their consumption]{.underline} and utilize renewable sources wherever
available to reduce their gas discharge levels. **[Smart
cities]{.underline}** often [utilize]{.underline} **[digital
sensors]{.underline}** [to]{.underline} measure and [transmit date about
the levels of GHCGs in the city]{.underline} at that moment, as a means
of tackling them \[15\]. The [efficacy]{.underline} of such a system
[is]{.underline} thus **[reliant]{.underline}** [on the network used to
collate and analyze the data collected as an extant
network]{.underline}. The mobile telecommunications networks offer a
convenient solution to this desire, as their pre-existence has the clear
benefit of reducing costs compared to the design and implementation of a
novel system, it is recognized that [smart cities will]{.underline}
**[certainly]{.underline}** [act]{.underline} [as the]{.underline}
**[key players]{.underline}** [meeting these ambitious
targets]{.underline} \[16,17\]. In this study, we focused primarily on
the potential applications of 5G network technology to control climate
change in Singapore. In addition a **[clear]{.underline}** overview of
the **[sustainability]{.underline}** **[benefits]{.underline}** [of
introducing]{.underline} **[5G]{.underline}** technology [compatible
smart cities, buildings, and farms in all aspects of
urbanization]{.underline} is provided. Herein. the main purpose is [to
tackle the]{.underline} **[negative outcomes]{.underline}** [associated
with]{.underline} anthropogenic **[climate change]{.underline}**, wish a
particular focus on the contributions that are best made by the telecoms
network operators.

[Climate change]{.underline} is [one of the **most challenging
problems**]{.underline} [that humanity has ever faced]{.underline}.
Presently, hundreds of **[millions of lives]{.underline}**,
**[innumerable species]{.underline}**, **[entire
ecosystems]{.underline}**, **[health]{.underline}**, economy, [and
the]{.underline} **[future habitability of this planet are at
risk]{.underline}**. Fortunately, [climate change is]{.underline}
**[solvable]{.underline}**, [we just need to wisely exploit the existing
technologies and sciences]{.underline}. Climate change mitigation is a
pressing international need in which many management actions are
required. The [development of]{.underline} **[5G]{.underline}**
technology [has been]{.underline} largely [driven]{.underline}
[by]{.underline} **[smart mobile devices]{.underline}** [and
advanced]{.underline} **[communication technologies]{.underline}**. It
may thus serve as a technical enabler for a whole new range of business
opportunities, energy, and facilities management, together with
industrial applications. Moreover, it may enable different devices to
work together seamlessly. Definitely, [the 5G cellular network
technology is expected to revolutionize the]{.underline} **[global
industries]{.underline}** [with profound effects on]{.underline} the
**[savings of energy]{.underline}**, **[waste generation and
recycling]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} **[water resources
management]{.underline}**, [thus reducing the]{.underline} **[climate
change impacts.]{.underline}**

#### Smart cities are [reliant]{.underline} upon 5G connectivity

The [creation of]{.underline} **[smart cities]{.underline}** [strongly
depends on the increased use of 5G networks]{.underline}, with the
[cities around the globe]{.underline} **[racing]{.underline}** [to
improve all aspects of their governed realms through the social,
monetary, and environmental gains]{.underline} offered by this
technology. Furthermore, [5G]{.underline} network [offers the basis for
the]{.underline} **[next generation]{.underline}** [of]{.underline}
[tec]{.underline}hnology [to be built upon]{.underline}. [The reasons
why 5G is appropriate for the]{.underline} **[smart solutions to city
management]{.underline}** [are]{.underline} **[primarily]{.underline}**
[due to its enormous **computing capacity** and **extent of
connectivity**]{.underline}. The use of [new technology can tie highly
effective to improve energy, waste, water resource, traffic flow, and
parking management]{.underline}. The end result is that a house, farm,
factory, building, and city can be more efficient, termed as smart
management. Overall, [it may]{.underline} **[greatly reduce carbon
dioxide emissions]{.underline}** [and climate change
problems.]{.underline}

#### Smart cities solve waste management

**Shah 21** -- researcher at the National University of Singapore. (Kwok
Wei Shah, "Potential Applications of 5G Network Technology for Climate

**[Waste management]{.underline}** options [such as]{.underline}
**[landfill]{.underline}**, **[composting]{.underline}**,
**[incineration/mass burns]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline}
**[anaerobic digestion]{.underline}**/biogas plants [collectively emit
a]{.underline} **[substantial]{.underline}** [amount of
GHGs]{.underline}. Composting makes use of micro-organisms to oxidize
the biodegradable wastes (especially food and garden waste) to CO2 and
water vapor using oxygen in the air as the oxidizing agent. Anaerobic
decomposition converts biodegradable carbon to biogas that consists of
about 65% of CH4 and 34% of CO2 with traces of other gases \[52\]. In
landfills, the microbes gradually decompose the organic matter over
time, producing roughly 50% of CH4 and 50% of CO2 as well as trace
amounts of other gaseous compounds \[52\]. [Methane emission from
landfills represents the largest source of GHG in the waste sector,
contributing around 700 million tons (Mt) of CO2-e in 2009, followed by
incineration, estimated to contribute around 40 Mt of CO2-e
\[53\].]{.underline}

Lately, [smart cities are providing]{.underline} **[dynamic
control]{.underline}** [of their waste streams]{.underline} \[54\].
[Companies are]{.underline} now **[better equipped]{.underline}** [with
appropriate software that enables monitoring the excretions. This
has]{.underline} **[dual benefits]{.underline}** [such as the reduction
of costs and the perceived load on the local ecosystems]{.underline}.
Both individuals and businesses refuse management has received multiple
high-tech updates such as self-sorting and collection tools. OnePlus
systems are the recognized toolbox for smart waste monitoring. An
example of this is the OnePlus Metro, which is a sensor capable of
providing real-time analysis of the free capacity currently available
within on-site storage bins. Combining this with the WasteForce platform
provides facile opportunities to monitor this capacity remotely. In
addition, it performs in-depth data assessment and evaluation as a means
of dynamic business management. The end result is that the business is
less likely to face financial penalties through the failure of waste
disposal in a timely manner. [At a wider scale, the data can be collated
by refuse collectors as a means of ensuring the efficiency of their
service can be maximized or through installation of remote image sensors
in their refuse storage bins that allow for personally monitoring the
charges in real time]{.underline}. As an additional benefit, the
inclusion of location tracker sensors using Global Positioning System
(GPS) technology offers the chance to streamline the delivery and
collection process on the fly[. Further data are provided by in-line
tilt monitors that offer a proxy for marking off when a bin has been
emptied. These features of the smart system work together to ensure that
drivers on the ground can better manage their agenda, minimize the time
of travel and distances, and adjust the schedules in response to sudden
changes immediately after receiving the automated text
instruction]{.underline}. It is clear that the
**[implementation]{.underline}** of such systems [can go]{.underline}
**[beyond]{.underline}** immediate [reduction of waste generation and
increased recycling, indicating the existence of **knock-on effects such
as tackling climate change**.]{.underline}

#### Plastic pollution from poor waste management is [increasing rapidly]{.underline} -- it'll crash [ocean biodiversity]{.underline}, causing [extinction]{.underline}

[The [oceans]{.mark}]{.underline} are vast. They cover more than 70% of
the earth's surface, hold 97% of the world's water, [[host]{.mark} some
of the [planet's most]{.mark}]{.underline} [[**diverse
ecosystems**]{.mark}, and [support **economies** in]{.mark} [countries
around the world]{.mark}]{.underline} \[1,2\]. [Microscopic
organisms]{.underline} in the seas [are a major source of atmospheric
**oxygen**]{.underline} \[3,4,5,6\]. By absorbing more than 90% of the
excess heat released into the earth's environment and nearly one-third
of carbon dioxide emissions, the oceans slow planetary warming and
stabilize the global climate \[7\].

[The oceans are essential to]{.underline} **[human health]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[well-being]{.underline}** \[8,9,10,11,12,13\].
[They [provide]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[food]{.underline}**]{.mark} to
billions, livelihoods for **[millions]{.underline}** [and are the
[source of]{.mark}]{.underline} multiple [[essential]{.underline}
**[medicines]{.underline}**]{.mark} \[14\]. They have traditional
cultural value and are a source of joy, beauty, peace, and recreation
\[15,16\]. The oceans are particularly important to the health and
well-being of people in small island nations \[17\], the high Arctic,
and coastal communities, especially those in the Global South \[1\]. The
very **[[survival]{.underline}]{.mark}** of these vulnerable populations
[[depends]{.mark} [on]{.mark} the health of the
[seas]{.mark}]{.underline} \[10,12\].

[Despite their]{.underline} vast [size, the [oceans
are]{.mark}]{.underline} [[**under threat**]{.mark}, and]{.underline}
[**[human activity]{.underline}** [is the]{.underline}]{.mark} main
[[source]{.underline}]{.mark} of the threat \[1,2\]. Climate change and
other environmental disruptions of human origin have caused sea surface
temperatures to rise, glaciers to melt, and harmful algal species and
pathogenic bacteria to migrate into waters that were previously
uncontaminated. Rising seas and increasingly violent coastal storms
endanger the 600 million people worldwide who live within 10 m of sea
level \[1\]. Rising concentrations of atmospheric CO2 have caused
acidification of the oceans, which in turn destroys coral reefs, impairs
development of oysters and other shellfish, and dissolves
calcium-containing microorganisms at the base of the food web
\[1,18,19\]. The oceans are losing oxygen \[1\]. Fish stocks are
declining \[20,21,22\]. Dredging, mechanized trawling, oil exploration,
and planned deep undersea metal mining threaten the seabeds \[23\].

**[[Pollution]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- unwanted, often hazardous waste
material released into the environment by human activity -- [is one of
the]{.underline} **[existential challenges]{.underline}** [of the
present age]{.underline} \[24\]. Like climate change, biodiversity loss,
and depletion of the world's fresh water supply, pollution [endangers
the]{.underline} **[stability]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} the
**[earth's support systems]{.underline}** [and
[threatens]{.mark}]{.underline} the **[[continuing survival of human
societies]{.underline}]{.mark}** \[8\].

[Pollution]{.underline} is also a great and growing threat to human
health. It [is the [largest]{.mark}]{.underline} environmental [[cause
of]{.underline} **[disease]{.underline}**]{.mark} in the world today,
[responsible for]{.underline} an estimated **[[9
million]{.underline}]{.mark}** premature **[[deaths per
year]{.underline}]{.mark}** \[24\]. [It]{.underline} causes enormous
economic losses, [undermines]{.underline} national trajectories of
economic development, and impedes attainment of the Sustainable
Development Goals (**[SDGs]{.underline}**) \[22\].

[Pollution has]{.underline} until recently [been]{.underline}
**[overlooked]{.underline}** in international development planning
[and]{.underline} largely [**[neglected]{.underline}**
[in]{.underline}]{.mark} [the [global]{.mark}]{.underline} health
[[agenda]{.underline}]{.mark} \[25\]. For too long, [pollution has been
regarded as]{.underline} the **[unavoidable]{.underline}** price of
economic progress \[25\], a view that arose out of the experience of the
19th and 20th centuries when combustion of fossil fuels -- coal in
particular -- was the engine of economic growth and pollution was seen
as unavoidable. Today, [however, the claim]{.underline} that pollution
is inevitable and that pollution control costs jobs and stifles
economies [is]{.underline} **[no longer tenable]{.underline}**. It has
been disproven by the experience of the many countries that have more
than doubled their GDPs in the past half century while greatly reducing
pollution \[24,25,26\]. It has become irrelevant with the increasing
availability of low-cost, renewable sources of energy and advances in
green chemistry.

[[Ocean pollution is]{.mark} a]{.underline} [**[critically
important]{.underline}** [but]{.underline}
**[underrecognized]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[component]{.underline}** of
global pollution \[26,27\]. [It has multiple direct and indirect impacts
on]{.underline} **[human health]{.underline}**
\[28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35\]. The nature and magnitude of these effects
are only beginning to be understood.

The purpose of this review is to examine the impacts of ocean pollution
on human health and well-being, identify gaps in knowledge, project
future trends, and offer scientifically based guidance for effective
interventions. Information presented in this review will guide
attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in particular,
SDG 14, which calls for prevention and significant reduction of all
marine pollution, and SDG 3, which calls for improvement of human health
and well-being.

The ultimate aim of this report is to increase awareness of ocean
pollution among policy makers, elected leaders, civil society and the
public and to catalyze global action to monitor, control, and prevent
pollution of the seas.

By focusing our analysis on human impacts, we underscore the fact that
pollution of the oceans poses a clear and present danger to human
health. It is causing disease, disability, and premature death in
countries around the world today.

On the positive side, pollution of the oceans is not inevitable. It is a
problem of human origin, and the successes in pollution control that
have been achieved in many countries show that it can be controlled and
prevented.

World leaders who recognize the great magnitude of ocean pollution,
acknowledge its grave dangers to human health, engage civil society and
the global public, and take bold, evidence-based action will be key to
stop ocean pollution at its source and safeguarding human health.

This report consists of a series of topic-focused reviews that
critically examine current knowledge of each ocean pollutant -- its
sources, magnitude, geographic extent, populations at greatest risk, and
its known and potential effects on human health. We examine the strength
of the evidence linking pollutants to health effects \[29\].

To the extent possible, we consider health effects not only of
individual pollutants, but also of the complex mixtures of chemical
pollutants and biological contaminants found in the seas today. We
examine interactions and synergies among pollution, climate change and
ocean acidification. Because the effects of pollution are
disproportionately concentrated in low-income countries in the Global
South, small island nations, and indigenous populations in the far north
\[12\], we specifically examine ocean pollution's impacts on these
vulnerable populations. Finally, we consider the prospects for
prevention and control of ocean pollution and present case studies of
success in pollution control.

The Current State of Ocean Pollution

[Pollution of the oceans is **[widespread]{.mark}**]{.underline}, it is
[**[worsening]{.mark}**, and]{.underline} its geographic extent is
**[expanding]{.underline}** \[26,27,30\]. [Ocean pollution
is]{.underline} a **[complex]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[ever-changing]{.underline}** mixture of chemicals and biological
materials that [[includes]{.underline} **[plastic
waste]{.underline}**]{.mark}, petroleum-based pollutants, toxic metals,
manufactured chemicals, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and a noxious stew
of nitrogen, phosphorus, fertilizer, and sewage (Figure ​(Figure11).

\[\[FIGURE 1 OMITTED\]\]

Some ocean pollutants are "legacy" pollutants, materials deposited in
the seas decades ago, while others are new. The relative concentrations
of pollutants vary in different regions of the oceans and at different
seasons of the year. Plastic pollution is the most visible component of
ocean pollution. It is growing rapidly, but it is only the obvious tip
of a much larger problem.

Land-based sources account for approximately 80% of ocean pollution,
while discharges from marine shipping, offshore industrial operations,
and waste disposal at sea account for the remaining 20% \[26\].
Pollution is most severe along coastlines and in bays, harbors, and
estuaries where wastewater discharges, industrial releases, agricultural
runoff, and riverine pollution cause massive in-shore contamination.
Some of the world's worst ocean pollution is seen along the coasts of
rapidly developing countries in the Global South \[26\].

The European Environment Agency (EEA) reports that pollution by toxic
metals, industrial chemicals and plastic wastes is at problem levels in
96% of the Baltic Sea, in 91% of the Black Sea, in 87% of the
Mediterranean Sea, and in 75% of the North-East Atlantic Ocean \[27\].
Pollution by plastic waste has become a global threat \[31\].

The drivers of ocean pollution are rapid industrialization; continuing
increases in the manufacture and release into the environment of
chemicals and plastics; expansion of chemically intensive agriculture;
massive releases of liquid and solid waste into rivers, harbors, and
estuaries; and insufficient re-use and recycling of feedstock materials
\[16,32\]. Specific sources of ocean pollution are:

> Coal combustion and gold-mining are the two main sources of marine
> mercury pollution \[33\].
>
> Exponential growth in chemical production coupled with inadequate
> controls on chemical releases are the main drivers of pollution of the
> oceans by manufactured chemicals \[34\].
>
> Marine pollution by plastic waste reflects massive global growth in
> plastic production, which now exceeds 420 million tons per year
> \[35\].
>
> Uncontrolled economic development and rapid population growth along
> the world's coasts has led to pollution of in-shore waters by
> industrial releases, agricultural runoff and sewage \[36,37,38,39\].
> Many populated coastal areas are now covered by buildings and
> impervious surfaces, which increases runoff. This runoff as well as
> discharges of wastewater and storm water, much of it inadequately
> treated, further increases pollution. The consequences are increasing
> abundance of pathogenic bacteria, viruses, and parasites \[40\],
> eutrophication, and increased frequency and severity of harmful algal
> blooms (HABs) -- "red tides", "brown tides", and "green tides" -- some
> of which produce potent disease-causing toxins.

Despite the great magnitude of ocean pollution and growing recognition
of its effects on human and ecosystem health, great gaps remain in
knowledge about pollution sources, levels of pollution in many areas of
the seas, the sizes of high-risk populations, the extent of human
exposure, and the magnitude of health effects. Because of these gaps,
the impacts of ocean pollution on human health and well-being are
underestimated, and it is not yet possible to fully quantify the
contribution of ocean pollution to the global burden of disease \[41\].

Climate Change, Global Warming, Ocean Acidification, and Pollution

Since the 1970s, the oceans have warmed steadily in concert with global
climate change \[42\]. They have taken up more than 90% of the excess
heat released into the climate system \[1\]. Mean sea surface
temperature is rising by 0.13°C per decade \[43\]. The frequency of
marine heatwaves has more than doubled \[1\].

Further impacts of climate change on the oceans are increases in the
intensity and frequency of extreme weather events such as heat waves,
heavy rainstorms, and major hurricanes, and changes in large-scale
planetary phenomena such as El Niño events \[44\] and the Indian Ocean
Dipole \[1,45,46\].

Ocean acidification is another consequence of climate change. The oceans
absorb nearly one-third of the carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted into the
atmosphere, and the amount of CO2 absorbed by the seas has increased in
recent decades as CO2 emissions of human origin have increased. Ocean
acidification is the result \[7\]. Since the late 1980s, the surface pH
of the open ocean has declined by about 0.1 pH units relative to
preindustrial time (i.e., a 26% increase in acidity \[hydrogen ion
concentration\]), and the rate of increase is 0.017--0.027 pH units per
decade \[1\].

Ocean acidification threatens the integrity of coral reefs. It impairs
the development of oysters and other commercially important shellfish,
thus impacting commercial fisheries. It endangers the survival of
calcium-containing microorganisms at the base of the marine food web
\[1,47\]. Ocean acidification may also increase the toxicity of certain
heavy metals and organic pollutants \[1,48\].

Global warming liberates legacy pollutants from ice and permafrost,
alters the geographic distribution of chemical pollutants in the oceans,
and increases exposures of previously unexposed populations. All of
these effects have potential to magnify the ocean pollution's impacts on
human health \[49\].

Rising sea surface temperatures and increasing ocean pollution result in
greater abundance and expanded geographic ranges of naturally occurring
marine pathogens, such as Vibrio species, among them Vibrio cholerae,
the causative agent of cholera \[50,51\] (Figure ​(Figure2).2). The
likely consequences will be increases in the frequency of
Vibrio-associated illnesses and spread of these infections to new,
previously unaffected areas. Risk is especially high in low-income
countries where coastal development is intense and sanitation systems
are dysfunctional due to civil unrest, conflict, sea level rise, coastal
over-development, and natural disasters \[52\].

\[\[FIGURE 2 OMITTED\]\]

In a similar manner, climate change, sea surface warming, and ocean
pollution appear to be increasing the frequency, severity, and global
geographic extent of harmful algal blooms (HABs) \[53,54\]. Some
dangerous algal species are moving poleward in response to the warming
of coastal waters \[54,55\], changes in ocean stratification, alteration
of currents, changes in nutrient upwelling, and changes in land runoff
and micronutrient availability \[56,57\]. The likely consequences will
be the occurrence of HABs in previously unaffected areas and exposures
of previously unexposed populations in the circumpolar regions to HAB
toxins.

Impacts of Ocean Pollution on Human Health

Chemical Pollutants

Toxic Metal Pollutants

Releases of toxic metals to the environment began millennia ago with the
inception of mining and smelting. These releases have increased since
the beginning of the Industrial Revolution and risen especially in the
past two centuries \[58,59,60\].

Mercury is the metal pollutant in the oceans of greatest concern for
human health \[34\]. Over the past 500 years, human activities have
increased total environmental mercury loading by about 450% above
natural background. About 70% of the mercury circulating in the
environment today consists of mercury emitted from human sources in the
past, termed legacy mercury \[61\] (Figure ​(Figure3).3). The presence of
large quantities of legacy mercury in the global environment and the
potential for climate change to remobilize this mercury complicate
projections of future exposures and health impacts.

\[\[FIGURE 3 OMITTED\]\]

Current Sources of Mercury Pollution

An estimated 2,220 tons of mercury are currently emitted to the
environment each year as the direct result of human activity. These
emissions account for about 30% of current mercury emissions. Another
60% of current mercury emissions result from environmental recycling of
anthropogenic mercury previously deposited in soils and water. The
remaining 10% comes from natural sources such as volcanoes.

Combustion of coal and artisanal/small-scale gold-mining (ASGM) are the
two principal human sources of current mercury emissions. All coal
contains mercury and when coal is burned, mercury is released into the
atmosphere where it can travel for long distances until ultimately it
precipitates into rivers, and lakes and the oceans.

In ASGM, mercury is used to form an amalgam to separate gold from rock.
The amalgam is heated to boil off the mercury leaving the gold behind.
ASGM operations release mercury to the environment through vaporization
and through runoff of spilled mercury into waterways \[34\]. Metal
mining and oil and gas exploration can be additional sources of mercury
release. In rivers, lakes and the oceans, the metallic, inorganic
mercury released to the environment from these sources is converted by
marine microorganisms into methylmercury, an organic form of mercury
that is a potent neurotoxicant.

The largest fraction of global mercury emissions -- about 49% --
originate today in East and South-East Asia. Coal combustion and
industrial releases are the major sources there. South America accounts
for 18% of global mercury emissions and Sub-Saharan Africa for 16%. In
both of these regions, ASGM is the major source of mercury releases.

Methylmercury is a persistent pollutant in the marine environment. It
bioconcentrates as it moves up the food web, so that top predator
species such as tuna, striped bass and bluefish as well as marine
mammals can accumulate concentrations of methylmercury in their tissues
that are 10 million or more times greater than those in surrounding
waters \[34\].

Mercury levels vary substantially in different regions of the ocean.
This variation is seen in a recent survey of methylmercury
concentrations in yellowfin tuna, in which levels differed by 26-fold
around the world. Highest levels were found in tuna from the North
Pacific Ocean (Figure ​(Figure4),4), and these high concentrations
reflect mercury releases from coal-fired power plants and steel mills in
Asia that are carried northeastward across the Pacific on the prevailing
winds \[62,63\].

\[\[FIGURE 4 OMITTED\]\]

Human exposure to methylmercury occurs primarily through consumption of
contaminated fish and marine mammals \[34,64\] Populations in the
circumpolar region are heavily exposed to mercury in their diets --
principally in the form of methylmercury -- as a consequence of their
traditional consumption of a diet rich in fish and marine mammals. Most
of the mercury to which these populations are exposed originates from
sources far away.

Neurobehavioral Toxicity of Methylmercury

The brain is the organ in the human body most vulnerable to
methylmercury. This vulnerability is greatest during periods of rapid
brain growth -- the nine months of pregnancy and the first years of
postnatal life \[65\].

There appears to be no safe level of methylmercury exposure in early
human development.

Prospective epidemiological cohort studies undertaken in the Faroe
Islands demonstrate that children exposed to methylmercury in utero
exhibit decreased motor function, shortened attention span, reduced
verbal abilities, diminished memory and reductions in other mental
functions. Follow-up of these children to age 22 years indicates that
these deficits persist and appear to be permanent \[66\].

A similar study conducted in Nunavik of child development at age 11
years showed that methylmercury exposure in early life is associated
with slowed processing of visual information, decreased IQ, diminished
comprehension and perceptual reasoning, impaired memory, shortened
attention span, and increased risk of attention deficit/hyperactivity
disorder (ADHD) \[67,68\]. Other prospective studies have also reported
neurobehavioral deficits in children with elevated prenatal exposure to
methylmercury \[69\].

Mercury exposure later in childhood and also in adolescence can also
cause damage because the human brain continues to develop throughout
this time \[70\]. Genetic factors may increase vulnerability to
methylmercury in some individuals \[71\].

Accelerated Loss of Neurocognitive Function in Adults Exposed to
Methylmercury

Recent studies have shown that adult exposures to methylmercury can also
have negative effects on brain function \[72\]. Thus, in a
cross-sectional study of 129 men and women living in six villages on the
Cuiaba River in Brazil, elevations in hair mercury concentrations were
associated with reductions in motor speed, manual dexterity, and
concentration \[73\]. Some aspects of verbal learning and memory were
also impaired. The magnitude of these effects increased with increasing
concentrations of mercury in hair. The brain functions disrupted in
adults by methylmercury -- attention span, fine-motor function, and
verbal memory -- are similar to those previously reported in children
with prenatal exposures but appear to occur at substantially higher
levels of exposure.

Cardiovascular Effects of Methylmercury Pollution

Elevated concentrations of methylmercury in blood and tissue samples are
associated with increased risk for acute coronary events, coronary heart
disease, and cardiovascular disease \[74\]. The US National Research
Council concluded in 2000 that methylmercury accumulation in the heart
leads to blood pressure alterations and abnormal cardiac function
\[75\].

Subsequent research has strengthened these findings. An expert panel
convened by the US Environmental Protection Agency in 2011 concluded
that methylmercury is directly linked to acute myocardial infarction and
to increases in cardiovascular risk factors such as oxidative stress,
atherosclerosis, decreased heart rate variability, and to a certain
degree, hypertension \[76\]. Likewise, a 2017 systematic review found
that methylmercury enhances production of free radicals resulting in a
long-lasting range of effects on cardiac parasympathetic activity that
increase risk for hypertension, myocardial infarction, and death \[77\].
Further research has confirmed these findings \[78,79\].

The Contribution of Marine Mercury Pollution to the Global Burden of
Disease

Efforts have begun to estimate the contribution of mercury pollution of
the oceans to the global burden of disease (GBD). A recent estimate
finds that between 317,000 and 637,000 babies are born in the United
States each year with losses of cognitive function that are the
consequence of prenatal exposures to methylmercury resulting from
consumption of mercury-contaminated fish by their mothers during
pregnancy. These losses range in magnitude from 0.2 to 5.13 IQ points
depending on the severity of exposure. These authors found additionally
that population-wide downward shifts in IQ caused by widespread exposure
to methylmercury are associated with excess cases of mental retardation
(IQ below 70), amounting to 3.2% (range: 0.2--5.4%) of all cases of
mental retardation in the United States \[80\].

Impacts of Ocean Acidification on Metals Toxicity

The alterations of carbonate chemistry in the seas -- i.e. decrease in
pH, decrease in \[CO32--\] and increase in \[HCO3--\]) -- that are the
consequences of increasing CO2 absorption induce changes in the
speciation of metals that alter their solubility and bioavailability and
therefore their toxicity \[48,81\].

For example, by 2100, the projected pH of the oceans will be
approximately 7.7, resulting in a 115% increase in the mean free ionic
form of copper (Cu2+) in certain estuaries \[82\]. Consequently, the
biotoxicity of copper to invertebrates \[83\] and to plankton
photosynthesis and productivity will be enhanced. At the same time,
however, ocean acidification will increase the concentration of
dissolved iron, which could partially alleviate the inhibitory effect of
copper on photosynthesis \[84\]. Ocean acidification appears in some
instances to mitigate \[85\] or even reduce \[86\] the toxicity of
mercury. As metals may play a role in the biodegradation of organic
pollutants, changes in metal speciation could slow these processes and
therefore potentiate the toxicity of some organic pollutants \[87\].

Prevention of Mercury Pollution

Evidence has shown that two actions will be key to preventing further
addition of mercury to the oceans. These are a cessation of coal
combustion and reduction of mercury use in artisanal and small-scale
gold mining (ASGM). Cessation of coal combustion will not only slow the
pace of climate change and reduce particulate air pollution, but will
also greatly reduce atmospheric emissions of mercury and thus reduce
additional deposition of mercury into the oceans. ASGM is a major source
of mercury pollution of the oceans in the Global South. Actions underway
under the aegis of the Minamata Convention are seeking to identify and
control major sources of mercury pollution from ASGM \[34\].

Plastic Pollution of the Oceans

**[Plastic waste]{.underline}** [[represents]{.underline}]{.mark}
approximately [**[80%]{.underline}** [of]{.underline}]{.mark} all
[[marine]{.mark} [litter]{.mark}]{.underline} \[88\]. An estimated 10
million metric tons of plastics -- range of estimate, 4.8 to 12.7
million -- are released to the oceans each year \[89\]. The total amount
of plastic waste circulating in the world's oceans is projected to be
150 million tons by 2025 \[89,90\]. Marine plastic waste ranges in size
from floating barrels, plastic bottles and plastic sheets down to
sub-microscopic particles and fibers.

Recent increases in marine plastic pollution reflect massive growth in
[plastic production]{.underline} (Figure ​(Figure5),5), which now
[exceeds]{.underline} [**420 million tons per year**. Much]{.underline}
of this plastic [[goes into]{.underline} **[consumer
products]{.underline}**]{.mark}, and [over]{.underline}
**[40%]{.underline}** [is]{.underline} used in products that are
[discarded within]{.underline} **[one year]{.underline}** of purchase --
[often after only a]{.underline} **[single use]{.underline}** \[91\].
[The consequence is]{.underline} **[massive global accumulation of
plastic waste]{.underline}** \[92\].

\[\[FIGURE 5 OMITTED\]\]

[Plastics]{.underline} are produced by the polymerization of highly
reactive and often toxic chemical monomers, 98% of them derived from
fossil fuels. They [are designed to be stable, durable and resistant to
degradation]{.underline} \[93\]. [Because of these properties, discarded
[plastic]{.mark} that reaches the marine environment [can **persist for
decades**]{.mark}]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [**travel long
distances**. Plastic waste is now]{.underline}
**[ubiquitous]{.underline}** in surface waters, on the coasts, in
estuaries, on the high seas, and even in the deepest and most remote
parts of the ocean \[94,95,96,97,98,99,100\].

Sources of Plastic Pollution

The United Nations Joint Group of Experts on the Scientific Aspects of
Marine Pollution (GESAMP) \[101\] estimates that land-based sources
account for up to 80% of the world's marine pollution with 60--95% of
this waste comprised plastic debris.

**[Rivers]{.underline}** [are a major source]{.underline} of plastic
waste in the oceans, and riverine input is estimated to be between 1.15
and 2.41 metric tons per year, corresponding to between 9 and 50% of all
plastic transported to the oceans. [Rivers draining]{.underline}
**[densely populated]{.underline}**, rapidly developing coastal
**[regions]{.underline}** [with]{.underline} **[weak
waste]{.underline}** collection **[systems]{.underline}**
[are]{.underline} **[particularly]{.underline}** [important]{.underline}
sources \[102\], and it is estimated that between
88--**[95%]{.underline}** [of marine plastic comes from]{.underline}
only **[10 rivers]{.underline}** \[103\]. Largest inputs, accounting for
approximately 86% of the plastic waste entering the marine environment,
are from the coasts of Asia, mainly China \[89,104\]. Additional sources
include aquaculture, fishing and shipping \[27\].

[[Plastic wastes]{.mark} are gathered by]{.underline} **[oceanic
currents]{.underline}** [and [collect]{.mark} in]{.underline} five
large, **[[mid-ocean]{.mark} gyres]{.underline}** located in the North
Pacific, South Pacific, North Atlantic, South Atlantic, and Indian
Oceans. The North Pacific gyre is a relatively stationary area twice the
size of France that has waste from across the North Pacific Ocean,
including material from the coastal waters of North America and from
Japan.

Marine Pollution by Plastic Microparticles

[[Weathering]{.mark}, mechanical [abrasion]{.mark}, and photodegradation
[break]{.mark} [plastic]{.mark} waste in the oceans down [into]{.mark}
smaller particles termed]{.underline}
**[[microplastics]{.underline}]{.mark}** (\<5 mm in diameter) and still
smaller particles termed nanoplastics (\<1μm in diameter; defined as
\<100 nm by some authors) \[105,106,107\]. The size distribution of
ocean microplastics is highly skewed, with increasing numbers of
particles at smaller particle sizes \[108,109\].
**[Microplastic]{.underline}** particle**[s]{.underline}** can
**[[sink]{.underline}]{.mark}** downward through the water column [and
**[accumulate]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[on the ocean]{.underline}
**[floor]{.underline}**]{.mark}. In contrast to microplastics, which
have been measured widely in the marine environment (e.g., Text Box 1)
and in marine organisms, concentrations of nanoplastics are poorly
defined \[110,111,112,113,114,115\].

\[\[BOX OMITTED\]\]

Microplastics are also manufactured. They are produced in the form of
microplastic beads -- polystyrene spheres 0.5 to 500 μm in diameter.
These beads are used in industrial processes such as 3D printing. They
also have multiple applications in human and veterinary medical products
to enhance drug delivery to tissues, and in cosmetics such as
toothpaste, abrasive scrubbers and sunscreen. Manufactured microplastic
beads are released to the environment from these products. They enter
the oceans by way of urban runoff, sewage discharge, and direct wash-off
of cosmetics and sunscreens from the skin of swimmers and surfers.

Microplastics degrade in the marine environment at varying rates
depending on the core material and weathering conditions. Some
petroleum-based plastics can take hundreds of years to degrade, although
under some circumstances photochemical degradation can be significant
\[97,116,117\].

[Microplastic particles contain]{.underline} substantial quantities of
**[toxic chemicals]{.underline}**. Toxic chemical additives are
incorporated into plastics during their manufacture to convey specific
properties such as flexibility, UV protection, water repellence, or
color \[118,119,120,121,122\]. These additives can comprise as much as
60% of the total weight of plastic products. They include plasticizers
such as phthalates, brominated flame retardants, antioxidants, UV
stabilizers, and pigments \[106,123\]. Due to their large
surface-to-volume ratio, microplastic particles can also adsorb toxic
chemical pollutants from the marine environment -- polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons (PAHs), PCBs, DDT, and toxic metals \[106\].

Some plastic additives such as synthetic dyes, are [classified
as]{.underline} **[mutagens]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[carcinogens]{.underline}** \[124,125,126\]. Others such as bisphenol
A and phthalates are endocrine disruptors -- chemicals that can mimic,
block, or alter the actions of normal hormones. Perfluorinated
additives, widely used in plastic to make them water-repellent, are
deleterious to human reproduction. Still other plastic additives can
reduce male fertility and damage the developing human brain \[127,128\].
Also of concern are residual unreacted monomers and toxic chemical
catalysts that may be trapped in plastic during its manufacture.

[Chemical additives and adsorbed chemicals can **leach** out of
microplastic and nanoplastic particles.]{.underline} They can
[[enter]{.mark} the]{.underline} [**[tissues]{.underline}** [of marine
organisms]{.underline}]{.mark} [that]{.underline}
**[ingest]{.underline}** these [particles, [including species consumed
by]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[humans]{.underline}**]{.mark} as seafood.
Concentrations of some chemical additives have been found to be orders
of magnitude higher in microplastic particles than in surrounding
seawater \[129\].

Marine Pollution by Plastic Microfibers and Tire-Wear Particles

Microfibers and tire-wear particles are distinct sub-categories of
microplastics. Microfibers originate mainly from the clothing and
textile industries \[130,131,132\]. Tire-wear particles are formed by
the abrasion of car and truck tires. These materials reach surface
waters and ultimately the oceans through runoff from roadways
\[133,134,135\].

Plastic microfibers are distributed globally in both water and air
\[129,136,137,138\]. They have become ubiquitous in all ecosystems. They
are found in seafood \[139,140\]. Humans can be exposed to microfibers
through consumption of contaminated fish or shellfish. Inhalation of
airborne microfibers may represent an even greater source of human
exposure \[141,142\].

Effects of Plastic Pollution on Marine Species

Elucidation of the toxicological impacts of microplastics, including
microfibers, is challenging because of their heterogeneity and great
complexity \[106\]. Microplastics span a wide range of sizes and shapes,
they are comprised of various polymer materials, and as noted above they
contain myriad chemical additives, the identity of which may be
proprietary and therefore not generally known. Once in the marine
environment, plastics undergo weathering and adsorb additional
contaminants, further enhancing their complexity. Finally, marine
species exhibit a range of sensitivity to microplastics \[143\]. All of
these factors complicate assessments of toxicity and health hazard
\[144,145\].

Although there is evidence for transfer of additives and adsorbed
chemicals from plastics to organisms, the relative contribution of
plastics to total chemical exposure by all pathways is thought in most
situations to be minor \[146,147,148,149,150,151,152\]. Likewise,
although some additives and sorbed contaminants are able to
bioaccumulate and biomagnify in aquatic food webs, there is not yet
strong evidence that plastic particles themselves are able to undergo
biomagnification \[153\].

Microplastics have potential to harm living organisms through several
mechanisms:

Physical toxicity. Macroscopic [plastic wastes]{.underline}, such as
bottle caps, small bottles, and food packaging, [can be]{.underline}
**[ingested]{.underline}** by fish, seabirds, and marine mammals that
mistake them for food. [Undigested plastic]{.underline}
**[accumulates]{.underline}** [in]{.underline} these animals'
**[gastrointestinal tracts]{.underline}** where [it can
cause]{.underline} **[obstruction]{.underline}** [that [leads to
malnutrition]{.mark}, [reproductive]{.mark} [impairment]{.mark} and
[death]{.mark}]{.underline} \[129,154,155,156,157,158,159,160\]. [Marine
species can]{.underline} also [be]{.underline} **[harmed]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[killed]{.underline}** [by becoming]{.underline}
**[entangled]{.underline}** in abandoned fishing gear, plastic nets and
plastic rings that are caught on reefs or drifting in the water column.
An estimated 5.7% of all fishing nets, 8.6% of all traps, and 29% of all
lines are lost each year \[161,162\].

[Plastic pollution is a [threat to]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[coral
reefs]{.underline}**]{.mark} \[163\]. Large plastic debris such as
plastic bags and sheeting can smother coral colonies by preventing light
from reaching the phototrophic organisms that build reefs and can also
cause physical damage.

Particle effects. [Microplastics can harm living organisms by virtue of
their ability to]{.underline} **[[damage cells]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
injure tissues, and cause inflammation \[164\]. While microplastics
cannot easily pass through cell membranes, nanoplastic particles can
cross the gut lining and accumulate in tissues \[165,166,167\] where
they may have the potential to cause deleterious effects \[168\].
Leachates containing tire-wear particles have been associated with storm
water-associated mortality in salmon \[169\].

Chemical Toxicity. The **[toxic chemical additives]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} the **[sorbed pollutants]{.underline}** [in and on
microplastics and nanoplastics can **leach** from plastic
particles]{.underline} and enter the tissues of marine organisms
\[123,170,171,172\]. Although plastic particles may not be a major
source of chemical exposure \[146,147,148,149,150,151,152\], there is
evidence that in some instances they can be significant contributors to
chemical body burden \[173\].

The challenges associated with assessing the impacts of microplastics on
marine organisms are evident in the divergent results of studies
reported to date. A recent meta-analysis and review of published
research on the effects of microplastics and macroplastics found similar
numbers of positive and negative results \[174\]. A major conclusion
from this and other reviews is that most of the experimental work to
date has been done using concentrations of microplastics that are not
environmentally relevant \[144,174,175\]. Future research should be
conducted under more environmentally relevant conditions \[174\].

Microplastics as Vectors for Microbial Pathogens

[An additional hazard of microplastic particles and fibers in the marine
environment is that [they]{.mark} can]{.underline}
**[[transport]{.underline}]{.mark}** [and]{.underline} [**shelter
[hazardous]{.mark} [microorganisms]{.mark}**, [including vectors
for]{.mark}]{.underline} **[human [disease]{.mark}]{.underline}**
\[176\]. Pathogenic bacteria have been detected on sub-surface
microplastics comprised of polyethylene fibers, in plastic-containing
sea surface films, and in polypropylene fragments sampled in a coastal
area of the Baltic Sea \[177\]. Similarly, E. coli and other potentially
pathogenic species have been found on plastics in coastal waters \[178\]
and on public beaches \[179\]. Algal species involved in HABs \[180\]
and ciliates implicated in coral diseases \[181\] have also been found
attached to marine microplastics.

These findings suggest that [harmful microbes and algae]{.underline}
that **[colonize plastics]{.underline}** in the marine environment [may
use microplastic particles to expand their **geographical
range**]{.underline} ('hitch-hiking'). Adhesion to marine plastic [may
also [enable]{.mark} [pathogens to increase]{.mark}]{.underline} their
**[[a]{.underline}]{.mark}**nti-**[[m]{.underline}]{.mark}**icrobial
**[[r]{.underline}]{.mark}**esistance [thus facilitating]{.underline}
their [**spread** to]{.underline} **[new areas]{.underline}** [where
they]{.underline} may [cause]{.underline} **[disease]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[death]{.underline}** in previously unexposed
populations \[177\].

Human Exposure to Plastic Pollution in the Oceans

Consumption of contaminated fish and shellfish is a major route of human
exposure to marine microplastics and their chemical contaminants
\[140,184,185\]. Microplastic and nanoplastic particles are ingested by
filter-feeders such as oysters and mussels that are then consumed by
humans. Microplastic particles are found also in finfish that have
consumed smaller organisms below them in the food web whose tissues are
contaminated by microplastics and nanoplastics \[123\]. Greatest [risks
of]{.underline} **[human exposure]{.underline}** are associated with
consumption of small fish such as sardines that are eaten whole,
including the gut \[186\]. The risk of microplastic ingestion [may
be]{.underline} **[especially great]{.underline}** in fishing
communities and in indigenous populations who rely heavily on seafood
and marine mammals for their diet.

### 2AC -- AT: Radiation

#### \*\*this is really bad\*\* No radiation impact -- if anything it makes you live [longer]{.underline}. 

**BBC 19** -- The British Broadcasting Corporation is the national
broadcaster of the United Kingdom. (Reality Check, \"Does 5G pose health
risks?,\" BBC News, 7-15-2019,
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-48616174, Accessed 7-23-2022,
LASA-SC)

The electromagnetic [radiation]{.underline} [used by]{.underline} all
[mobile phone]{.underline} technologies has [led some]{.underline}
people [to worry]{.underline} [about]{.underline} increased **[health
risks]{.underline}**, [including]{.underline} developing certain types
of [cancer]{.underline}.

In 2014 the World Health Organization (WHO) said that \"**[no adverse
health effects]{.underline}** [have been established as being caused by
mobile phone use]{.underline}\".

However, the WHO together with the International Agency for Research on
Cancer (IARC) has classified all radio frequency radiation (of which
mobile signals are a part) as \"possibly carcinogenic\".

It has been put in this category because \"[there is evidence
that]{.underline} **[falls short]{.underline}** [of being
conclusive]{.underline} that exposure may cause cancer in humans\".

[Eating]{.underline} **[pickled vegetables]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} using **[talcum powder]{.underline}** [are classed in
the same category]{.underline}.

[Alcoholic drinks]{.underline} and processed meat are [in a]{.underline}
**[higher category]{.underline}** [because the evidence is
stronger.]{.underline}

A toxicology report released in 2018 by the US Department of Health, and
pointed to by those expressing safety concerns, found that male rats
exposed to high doses of radio frequency radiation developed a type of
cancerous tumour in the heart.

For this study, rats\' whole bodies were exposed to radiation from
mobile phones for nine hours a day every day for two years, starting
before they were born.

**[No cancer link]{.underline}** was [found for the female rats or the
mice studied. It was also found that rats exposed to the radiation lived
longer than those in the control group.]{.underline}

#### No cancer.

[Epidemiological research]{.underline} [on]{.underline}
**[5G]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[cancer]{.underline}**

As far as the laws of physics and ionization are concerned,
[5G]{.underline} **[shouldn't worry us]{.underline}**. But that's only
one field of scientific study. After all, we can't rely on physicists to
inform our knowledge on biochemistry. What about epidemiological
evidence?

In health research, randomized controlled trials (RCT) --- where
researchers take test subjects and randomly assign them to either
treatment or placebo --- are considered the gold standard of evidence.
Unfortunately, it's impractical, if not impossible, to conduct an RCT on
cell phones and cancer on humans. We'd have to assign particular levels
of cellphone use to thousands of people, and trust they'd all maintain
that level of use for at least five years, to get accurate data.

The next best thing are **[cohort studies]{.underline}**. [A
massive]{.underline}, 13-country [INTERPHONE cohort study conducted by
the IARC found]{.underline} **[no elevation of gliomas or brain
tumors]{.underline}** [in populations that used phones heavily, except
perhaps at the highest level]{.underline}. Even then, they concluded
that "biases and error prevent a causal interpretation with regard to
the increased risk of glioma observed at the highest exposure levels."

Even if mobile phones caused some brain cancers, what you'd expect to
see is something similar to smoking --- the heavier the smoker, the more
likely they are to develop lung cancer --- the more cell phone usage,
the more likely cancers would manifest.

According to Grimes, "[that]{.underline} **[dose-response]{.underline}**
[relationship doesn't exist for cell phones]{.underline}. **[It isn't
there.]{.underline}** It's just noise. That would imply, from an
epidemiological standpoint, that [there's]{.underline} **[no
evidence]{.underline}** [of harm.]{.underline}"

[As]{.underline} cell [phones]{.underline} [have become]{.underline}
more and **[more ubiquitous]{.underline}**, [brain tumor rates
have]{.underline} **[not]{.underline}** [been going up]{.underline} in
the United States. If cell phones cause brain tumors like cigarettes
cause lung cancer, [we should have seen **an alarming increase by
now.**]{.underline}

Nonetheless, the scientists involved in the study could not agree on how
its results should be described. John Niederhuber, the then-director of
the National Cancer Institute, said that INTERPHONE "illustrates how
difficult it is to identify and corroborate, or definitively rule out,
any possible association between \[cell phones and cancer\]."

Adding to the confusion: the INTERPHONE study was partially funded by
the mobile phone industry, though it was subject to guarantees that the
study would remain scientifically independent. This garnered significant
skepticism over its results. Consequent cell phone radiation studies
funded by telecom companies have, understandably, led to well-placed
concerns about bias, while adding fuel to the conspiracy fire.

Still, we can point to at least **[five other]{.underline}**
[high-quality cohort studies]{.underline} --- published in the Journal
of the National Cancer Institute, the American Journal of Epidemiology,
the European Council of Cancer Prevention, the International Journal of
Epidemiology, and Bioelectromagnetics --- [that overall]{.underline},
**[found no increased risk for cancer]{.underline}**, but perhaps a
small increased risk for the non-cancerous tumor neuroma. (Researchers
noted these tumors were so rare that they were uncertain about the
link.)

[The five studies]{.underline}, published between 2009 and 2016,
[were]{.underline} **[not]{.underline}** [funded by the cell phone
industry and are less likely to be biased]{.underline}. But it's
important to note that how we use cell phones has changed dramatically
over the last decade. The data could be outdated. It's possible that
longer-term studies will find larger cancer effects in another five or
10 years, but until then, the [research so far has one thing in common:
lack of evidence. This is a major problem with cell phone science at the
moment.]{.underline}

### AT: Health Hazards

Over the years, Dr. Curry's warning spread far, resonating with
educators, consumers and entire cities as the frequencies of cellphones,
cell towers and wireless local networks rose. To no small degree, [the
**blossoming anxiety** over the **professed health risks of 5G
technology** can be traced to a **single scientist** and a **single
chart**.]{.underline}

[Except that Dr. Curry and his graph **got it wrong**]{.underline}.

[According to **experts**]{.underline} on the biological effects of
electromagnetic radiation, [radio waves become **safer** at higher
frequencies, **not more dangerous**]{.underline}. (Extremely
high-frequency energies, such as X-rays, behave differently and do pose
a health risk.)

In his research, Dr. [Curry]{.underline} looked at studies on how radio
waves affect tissues isolated in the lab, and
**[misinterpreted]{.underline}** the [**results** as applying to cells
deep inside the human body. His analysis **failed to recognize** the
protective effect of **human skin**. At higher radio frequencies, the
skin acts as a **barrier**]{.underline}, shielding the internal organs,
including the brain, from exposure. [Human skin blocks the even higher
frequencies of sunlight.]{.underline}

["It **doesn't penetrate**," said]{.underline} Christopher M.
**[Collins]{.underline}**, a [professor of radiology at New York
University]{.underline} who studies the effect of high-frequency
electromagnetic waves on humans. Dr. [Curry's graph]{.underline}, he
added, [**failed to take into account** "the **shielding
effect**."]{.underline}

Dr. Marvin C. [**Ziskin**, an emeritus professor of medical physics at
Temple University School of Medicine, **agreed**]{.underline}. For
decades, Dr. Ziskin explored whether such high frequencies could sow
illness. **[Many experiments]{.underline}**, he said, [**support the
safety** of high-frequency waves]{.underline}.

Despite the benign assessment of the medical establishment, Dr. [Curry's
flawed reports were **amplified by alarmist websites**]{.underline},
prompted articles linking cellphones to brain cancer and served as
evidence in lawsuits urging the removal of wireless classroom
technology. In time, [echoes of his reports fed **Russian news sites**
noted for **stoking misinformation about 5G technology**. What began as
a simple graph became a **case study** in how bad science can **take

Mathematics and Industrial Engineering at Polytechnique Montréal
(Nathalie, with Frédéric Marty, Eva Thelisson, and Thierry Warin,
"Artificial Intelligence and Market Manipulations: Ex-ante Evaluation in
the Regulator\'s Arsenal," CIRANO Working Paper 64, 2020, dml)

These tools are all the more important since [the development of
algorithmic decisions poses **unprecedented problems** of]{.underline}
understanding the predictions that the latter make (notably because of
the diffusion of artificial intelligence tools). The issue at stake is
the explicability of choices and the detection of **[manipulative
practices]{.underline}**. We focus in this paper on algorithmic
manipulations and the consequences in terms of privacy and competition
protection.

The article is structured as follows. Section 2 presents the risks that
[[increasing]{.mark} the use of]{.underline} Artificial Intelligence
(**[[A.I]{.mark}.]{.underline}**) in algorithmic recommendation systems
[may induce consumers to **[reduce]{.mark}** their **[freedom of
choice]{.mark}**]{.underline}, **[behavioural
manipulations]{.underline}**, [or even through]{.underline} personalized
but unbalanced **[contractual conditions]{.underline}**. A third section
shows that [[consumer damage]{.mark} can also [occur]{.mark}
**indirectly** [through]{.mark} an **[infringement of
competition]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [through]{.underline} the
**[[consolidation]{.underline}]{.mark}** of individual dominant
positions [[or]{.underline}]{.mark} the increase of **[[algorithmic
collusion]{.underline}]{.mark}** risks. A fourth section focuses on
solutions for **[[regulating algorithms by other
algorithms]{.underline}]{.mark}** or monitoring procedures, allowing
accountability for the actual functioning of the algorithms implemented.
The first avenue [[uses **algorithmic tools**]{.mark} by the market
supervisors [to]{.mark} **detect**]{.underline} possible **[abnormal
patterns]{.underline}** that could lead to procedures. A second way may
involve [the use of **algorithmic countermeasures**]{.underline} by
consumers. A fifth section [considers]{.underline} how \"**[highly
consequential decisions]{.underline}**\" can be [the subject of
**special attention**]{.underline} by the firm\'s different
stakeholders. Taking [these]{.underline} decisions into account
[can]{.underline} lead to devices\' design, [allow]{.underline}ing
[firms to **[guarantee]{.mark}** their [algorithms\' **integrity** and
**ethics**]{.mark} through **scoring methods**]{.underline}. We present
the confidence index, developed by the A.I. Transparency Institute,
adapting it to the issues related to consumer and competition law.

2\. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AS A POTENTIAL VECTOR OF RISKS FOR CONSUMERS

[Three types of damage to the consumer can be considered]{.underline}.
The **[first]{.underline}** type of damage is the [reduction
of]{.underline} the **[choices]{.underline}** open to him. The
**[second]{.underline}** damage lies in [the possibility of
**manipulation**]{.underline} of choices. The range of available
solutions is not artificially closed, but the [consumer\'s behaviour is
**altered** by producing stimuli intended to **bias** their
decision]{.underline}. The **[third]{.underline}** type of damage
corresponds to what we call an [abuse of **exploitation**]{.underline}.
The [ability to predict]{.underline} the [characteristics]{.underline}
of the consumer (technical expertise, ability to pay, etc\....)
[makes]{.underline} it [possible]{.underline} to make offers leading to
[the **extraction** of the consumer\'s **entire surplus**]{.underline}
(which would not be possible with uniform prices or imperfectly
differentiated prices) [or]{.underline} leading to **[discriminatory
offers]{.underline}**, whether in terms of price or the quality of the
products and services offered.

2.1 Reducing the consumers\' choice space

[A.I. allows changes that **break**]{.underline} the [usual business
paradigms]{.underline}. [A.I. can be used]{.underline} within the
framework of strategies that can lead, through increasingly finely
targeted recommendations or recommendations [to **limit** consumers\'
freedom of choice]{.underline}. The latter may see their range of
choices reduced according to their past consumption or according to the
customer segment to which the algorithm links them; A.I. is a prediction
tool based on machine learning. (Agrawal, Gans, and Goldfarb, 2018). In
other words, [they can be enclosed in]{.underline} the equivalent of [a
**filter bubble**]{.underline}. Such an effect may be aggravated by
shifting some platforms from a shopping-then-shipping logic to a
shipping-then-shopping logic (Agrawal, Gans, and Goldfarb 2017). The
customer may indeed incur a cost to reship the product even if the
return would be free.

A.I. can also facilitate practices that can lead to manipulating
consumer choices through a precise understanding of their behaviour or
an accurate estimate of their maximum payment capacity. Indeed, as noted
by Ezrachi and Stucke (2020): "\[...\] in a data-driven economy,
personal data on user behaviour, preferences, weaknesses, and habits is
the new currency for the advertising - and marketing dependent --
business models". These capabilities require the monitoring of massive,
diversified and continuously updated data and the mastery of analytical
tools to customize offers concerning consumers\' decision-making
frameworks or better predict other operators\' strategies (Marty and
Warin 2020b, 2020c). The takeover of Onavo by Facebook or that of Looker
by Google testifies the importance of the ability to master the
competitive environment through the technical possibility of better and
better forecasting the present.

Several examples of the limitation of consumers\' capacity for choice
could be added to the filter bubble and shipping-then-shopping models
presented above. Some are related to cost factors. They are often linked
to complementarities between types of equipment that play as many
factors aggravating the costs of change between ecosystems. Biases can
then arise from how choices are proposed. The case of personal
assistants shows how the options proposed can be reduced to a minimal
range. The last example, developed by Ezrachi and Stucke (2020), is
based on the possibility of controlling the dissemination of innovations
in ecosystems by the pivotal operator of each of them.

To illustrate their thinking, Ezrachi and Stucke (2020, p. 42) are based
on Rodgers\' innovation diffusion model (2003). The adoption of an
innovation by a given individual is described as a fivephase process.
The first is the knowledge phase. The individual must be informed of the
availability of an innovative solution and its functions. The second is
that of persuasion. It is through it that the individual forms
favourable or unfavourable anticipations towards it. The third is that
of the decision of adoption or non-adoption. The fourth is that of
implementation. The fifth, finally, is that of the confirmation of the
adoption. It can be confirmed by observing the choice of third parties
or, on the contrary, be negatively affected by negative messages.

The strategic action of platforms - if they can detect their users\'
behaviour - can play in favour of the adoption of an innovation
developed internally (or by a preferred complement-maker) and
unfavourably for an innovation developed by an independent firm. The
first variant may explain why digital ecosystems promote early and
massive adoption of innovations. The second may explain why innovations
fail to spread.

2.2 The manipulation of consumers\' behaviour

[Markets' **DNA** is]{.underline} ultimately [the **price
mechanism**]{.underline}. The latter plays an important function: [it
**informs** market participants before they make a
decision]{.underline}. [There is **abundant literature** on
the]{.underline} concept of "**[value of information]{.underline}**,"
and some authors have looked at the value of information in the context
of price strategies on digital markets (Warin and Leiter 2012; Warin and
Troadec 2016) as well as from a regulatory perspective (Marciano,
Nicita, and Ramello 2020). With A.I., now some firms have access to the
aggregated information and the customer's value of information, through
notably recommender systems. With this rich access to the value of
information, [A.I. can be used to **model** consumer behaviour and
create an **incentive** leading to **purchase**]{.underline} (emotional
pitch, dark nudge\...) [at the right time]{.underline}. [These
problems]{.underline} go beyond the scope of A.I. alone in that they
[can be observed within]{.underline} the framework of **[traditional
algorithms]{.underline}**. For example, many merchant sites can
implement drip pricing strategies (Rasch, Thöne, and Wenzel 2020) or
price partitioning. The customer can be engaged in a purchasing process
by an attractive call price and only \"discover\" the full price later.
The time spent to complete the subsequent pages will make him forget the
competitors\' price consulted at the beginning of his search, or she
will be reluctant to start his search process from scratch (Marty,
2019).

The notion of **[[dark patterns]{.underline}]{.mark}** illustrates these
practices, which [[can be **aggravated** by A.I.]{.mark}
performance]{.underline} (Stigler Center, 2019). It covers all the
profiling methods, algorithmic proposals or user interfaces
[[that]{.mark} can **[restrict]{.mark}** the ability to make a **free**
and **informed [choice]{.mark}**]{.underline} on the consumer\'s part.
Dark patterns are also called **[[dark]{.underline}]{.mark}** nudges or
bad **[[sludges]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Therefore, they cover strategies
that [[increase]{.mark} the **[opacity]{.mark}** of consumers\'
choices]{.underline}, [making it **more difficult**]{.underline} for
them [to **express**]{.underline} their [preferences
**freely**]{.underline}, [or]{.underline} that [leads them to make
decisions that they **would not have**]{.underline} made spontaneously.

Dark patterns can be produced to lead consumers to make decisions that
are not in line with their preferences. While a (positive) nudge is
theoretically part of a logic of liberal paternalism - leading the
individual to behave in a way that is in line with his interest and the
general interest - such dark nudges aim to lead them to act in a way
that is not in line with their interests (C. Sunstein 2019; Thaler
2018). Therefore, [it is a question of **manipulating** consumer choices
by **voluntarily altering** their preferences or]{.underline} even
[creating them through **cognitive biases**]{.underline} (framing
effect, sunk cost fallacy, anchoring, etc.). [Dark sludges
can]{.underline} therefore [be defined as]{.underline} "[an **evil
nudge**]{.underline} \[\...\] [that can **exploit**]{.underline}
\[online consumers\] [cognitive biases to]{.underline} persuade them to
[do something]{.underline} that is **[undesirable]{.underline}**,
typically [by [introducing]{.mark}]{.underline} excessive
[**[friction]{.mark}** into choice architecture]{.underline}" (C. R.
Sunstein 2020).

It is essential to distinguish within dark patterns the nuance between
bad nudges and bad sludges. A nudge can be defined as an encouragement,
a small nudge that leads the agent to act in a given direction. It is a
push towards action. It is often presented as positive (the agent is
encouraged to act in his interest as long as he does not spontaneously).
It can, however, be harmful. For example, a bad nudge is used as part of
an emotional sales pitch: a banner appears through an untimely window
leading to a click to access a given service for which the consumer is
known to have developed an addiction. Therefore, it is a push - in the
sense of a stimulus - to make the consumer \"fall\" to the side we know
she tends to lean to.

The concept of nudge in the behavioural economics literature was mainly
based on reflecting on actors\' decision-making environment to make
better-informed choices without restricting their freedom. Therefore,
the aim was to promote a choice architecture that reconciles autonomy
and \"signalling\" the best options for the agent himself (Thaler and
Sunstein 2009).

However, this thrust - through the design of the architecture of
choice - can also be exercised in a much less benevolent way. As noted
above, it can be used in the firm\'s interest and to the consumer\'s
detriment. It is no longer a question of inciting the consumer to make
the right decision for her but pushing him to decide following the
firm\'s interests. Therefore, a nudge can be positive and negative and
can be part of a dark pattern.

Conversely, the term **[sludge]{.underline}** evokes friction. It is
more in the primary sense of getting bogged down, of losing mobility. It
[is about creating artificial difficulties to **prevent** consumers from
exercising their freedom of choice]{.underline}, from identifying the
most favourable options or, conversely, from exercising them. Thaler
(2018) gives a simple but evocative example. The consumer decides to
purchase a good or subscribe to an online service by considering the
offer of a deferred refund. However, this benefit is conditional on
sending proof of purchase by mail within a given period (or the tedious
creation of an online account). Many consumers who have based their
decisions on this rebate will not claim it. As Thaler notes (2018, p.
431): "because of this thick sludge, redemption rates for rebates tend
to be low, yet the lure of the rebate still can stimulate sales - call
it \'buy bait.\'"

A sludge is defined as a "kind of friction, large or small, that people
face when they want to go in one or another direction" (C. Sunstein
2019). It can also help prevent a harmful attitude on the part of the
consumer himself (curbing a shopping frenzy, ensuring his eligibility
conditions or characteristics, forcing him to benefit from a cooling-off
period) and, on the contrary, hindering access to legitimate
rights.5Like a nudge, a [sludge is based on the
**exploitation**]{.underline} - through the strategic establishment of
the architecture of choice - [of economic agents\' **behavioural
biases**]{.underline}. What biases can a friction mechanism take
advantage of? These can be, for example, inertia biases (Madrian and
Shea 2001), of procrastination (Akerlof 1991) and preferably for the
present (O'Donoghue and Rabin 2015).

The notion of [bad sludge is]{.underline} also [found in
disputes]{.underline} between companies [at the heart of]{.underline}
major digital ecosystems and their suppliers. For example, as noted in
the report on [**competition** in]{.underline} the digital sector
published in October 2020 by the Antitrust Subcommittee of the U.S.
House of Representatives, the notion of \"bad sludge\" can be found in
disputes between companies at the heart of [**large digital ecosystems**
and their **suppliers**]{.underline} (Judiciary Committee House of
representatives, 2020, p.218), one of the arguments raised by EPIC Games
in its lawsuit against Google in the U.S.6 Game developer Fortnite
insists that bypassing the Play Store - which is technically possible
and easy - is made more difficult and stressful for the consumer to
deter them from downloading the game directly:

"Direct downloading on Android mobile devices, however, differs
dramatically. Google ensures that the Android process is technically
complex, confusing and threatening, filled with dire warnings that scare
most consumers into abandoning the lengthy process. For example,
depending on the version of Android running on a mobile device,
downloading and installing Fortnite on an Android device could take as
many as 16 steps or more, including requiring the user to make changes
to the device\'s default settings and manually granting various
permissions while being warned that doing so is dangerous. Below are the
myriad steps an average Android user has to go through in order to
download and install Fortnite directly from Epic\'s secure servers."

Friction is not limited to the initial download but also updates. Still,
according to the complaint filed last August by EPIC:

"As if this slog through warnings and threats were not enough to ensure
the inferiority of direct downloading as a distribution method for
Android apps, Google denies downloaded apps the permissions necessary to
be seamlessly updated in the background---instead allows such updates
only for apps downloaded via Google Play Store. The result is that
consumers must manually approve every update of a \"sideloaded\" app. In
addition, depending on the O.S. version and selected settings, such
updates may require users to go through many of the steps in the
downloading process repeatedly, again triggering many of the same
warnings. This imposes onerous obstacles on consumers who wish to keep
the most current version of an app on their mobile device and further
drives consumers away from direct downloading and toward Google\'s
monopolized app store wish to keep the most current version of an app on
their mobile device and further drives consumers away from direct
downloading and toward Google\'s monopolized app store" (Ibid, §98).

What is here the potential usefulness of these dark nudges? Maintaining
the online application store as a lock on access to the ecosystem
(gatekeeper site downloading) ensures the core business\'s private
regulatory power (structuring power).

Therefore, controlling the ecosystem involves imposing technical and
psychological frictions to counter the threat of loss of control through
direct application downloading.7:

"As if this slog through warnings and threats were not enough to ensure
the inferiority of direct downloading as a distribution method for
Android apps, Google denies downloaded apps the permissions necessary to
be seamlessly updated in the background---instead allows such updates
only for apps downloaded via Google Play Store. The result is that
consumers must manually approve every update of a \"sideloaded\" app."

The notion of dark pattern goes beyond manipulating choices and
behaviours; it can also relate to Internet users\' information
disclosure (or excessive privacy reduction). In such a case of a nudge,
the design of the site or the modes of presentation of the choices make
the user go beyond what is necessary or what he would have accepted if
his choice had responded to the rationality of type 2 (Acquisti,
Brandimarte, and Loewenstein 2020). It is not just a matter of
exploiting consumers\' or users\' vulnerabilities to induce them to make
choices that correspond to trends that they could rationally try to curb
but in the extreme of eliciting (i.e., constructing) these preferences
(Mulligan, Regan, and King 2020). The dark pattern can, therefore,
result from the design of a site. This is the case of clickwraps that
lead the consumer to make choices in blocks for questions of very
different kinds and importance (Obar and Oeldorf-Hirsch 2018). There
are, therefore, \"manipulative by design\" devices. Their analysis is
not new in the online world (Calo 2014) or even in the offline world
(Hanson and Kysar 1999). However, the nature of the online journey and
the ability to capture, process, infer and create targeted stimuli make
the effects far more farreaching.

The modalities for implementing these practices can be fundamental. An
Internet user, who is asked several times for his personal data
protection preferences after each refusal, will accept, either
inadvertently or to stop the requests (Luguri and Strahilevitz 2019). 8
The same applies to the techniques described above in which the price is
only revealed at the end of the purchase process or transactions in
which options that the consumer would not have wished to subscribe to
are \"preselected\" in a non-obvious way.9

In the same way, the notion of a dark pattern can cover emotional pitch
practices. The idea is to produce a stimulus that would make the
consumer switch to an act of purchase. Such stimuli can be the
announcement (except in the form of an untimely window) of a price
reduction or the announcement of a limited number of remaining products
coupled with messages indicating that another Internet user has just
bought one.10 It is then a question of creating a sense of urgency,
which will push the consumer to rush his purchase for fear of running
out of available stock. (Mathur et al., 2019). In such situations, it is
a question of calling upon the system 1 of our brain that of the fast,
instinctive guided by routines, emotional choice\... and no longer upon
system 2, that of rational choice11 (Kahneman 2011). Whether it is a
question of \"pushes or frictions,\" the architecture of the choices and
the exact path of the Internet user (and of the consumer in general)
exerts a determining influence and calls for questioning the firm\'s
responsibility that sets them up.

[A.I.\'s development could make these strategies **more
useful**]{.underline} by allowing a better understanding of consumer
behaviour after closely linking it to a given segment based on observed
and inferred characteristics. In other words, [[A.I.]{.mark} can
[promote]{.mark} the **[personalization]{.mark}** of prices
[and]{.mark}]{.underline} the personalization of
**[[manipulations]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Indeed, as the Stigler Center
notes (2019, p. 238), [the use of [**sludges** will have **multiplier
effects** through]{.mark} the use of [A.I.]{.mark}]{.underline}: "Dark
patterns are often used to direct users towards outcomes that involve
greater data collection and processing. Additionally, the proliferation
of data-driven computational methods allows firms to identify
vulnerabilities of users and to target specific users with these
vulnerabilities12" (Gray et al. 2018).

For example, A.I. can make it possible to determine which stimulus to
present to a consumer and when to do so based on an increasingly refined
prediction of its characteristics and, therefore, also of its inferred
weaknesses. Luguri and Strahilevitz (2019) propose a detailed typology
of the different mechanisms linked to dark patterns. We reproduce it in
part in table 2 presented below, adding elements developed by Gray et
al. (2018)

The existence of manipulative strategies explains the difference between
agents\' preferences, such as protecting their data and their actual
behaviour. Acquisti et al. (2013) have shown that agents may agree to
pay to protect their data. Similarly, their online behaviour (multiple
email addresses, specialization of different social networks\...) also
attests to this strategy (Acquisiti et al., 2020). However, the case of
the dark patterns described above shows that it is necessary to
distinguish between willingness and opportunity. Psychological biases
can thwart the expression of preferences and open up the possibility of
manipulations such as those we have just detailed. Table 3 below
reproduces the elements presented by Acquisti et al. (2020).

Some of the effects are related to behavioural biases; others are
created and amplified by practices that play on these biases. Errors in
risk estimation do not need to be supported by the actions of the sites
concerned. A loss of confidentiality is potentially very high but is
assessed as low probability and is distant. Therefore, as in other areas
that can induce systemic risks, they will be minimized in
decision-making (Kunreuther and Ginsberg 1978).

For other dimensions, it is possible to find the notion of dark patterns
presented here. According to Acquisti et al. (2020), it is possible to
illustrate how these biases can be instrumentalized. The consumer will
overvalue a tangible and immediate gain compared to a deferred and
intangible risk. Moreover, as we have seen for bad sludges, it is not
even a given to meet the conditions for activating these offers ex-post.
The same sensitivity to bad sludges or bad nudges may stem from agents\'
uncertainty about their preferences. The presentation of options can,
therefore, guide agents\' decisions\... even against their interests. As
presented in the table above, apparently \"transparent\" devices can
intuitively work against consumers\' interests (Acquisti, John, and
Loewenstein 2013). Indeed, the illusion of control - through broad
possibilities for personalizing choices - can lead users to accept
excessive disclosure of their data (Brandimarte, Acquisti, and
Loewenstein 2013). Similarly, gradual but continuous degradation of data
protection may be perceived by users but not be subject to a revision of
initial choices: \"the human brain seems to interpret the persistence of
a problem as evidence that the problem is intractable, and hence not
worthy of further attention, so it dials down the emotional response
(Acquisti, Brandimarte, and Loewenstein 2020).

2.3 The imposition of unbalanced contractual conditions

A.I. can lead to an excellent segmentation of customers allowing them to
propose almost personalized prices. The problem with the latter is that
placed at the level of the consumer\'s maximum propensity to pay, a
perfectly discriminating price makes it possible to confiscate the
totality of the consumer\'s surplus. There is no damage in terms of
efficiency in economic terms, but an undue transfer of welfare compared
to the distribution that would prevail in perfect competition.

Moreover, it should be noted that discrimination between customers may
also prevail in uniform pricing. If it is possible to determine the
customer\'s needs and the level of technical expertise, it is
conceivable to offer him a product with less attractive characteristics
or with degraded performance. The vendor can take advantage of the
informational advantage he knows he has over his customer and the
production flexibility that will increasingly allow him to use Industry
4.0 models. These are the so-called versioning practices. The less
expert consumer may be offered products or services that are ultimately
more expensive than the personalized offer\'s intrinsic value. (Marty,
2019).

The notion of \"augmented dark pattern\" can, therefore, cover several
modalities. The one we have just seen corresponds to manipulation by
transaction costs. The consumer\'s well-being is degraded through
exploitative abuses in the form of a confiscated personalized price (of
his surplus), an offer with a degraded price/quality ratio, or in the
form of barriers to exit. The notion of dark pattern also covers
consumer behaviour manipulations, based on the acceptable identification
of their characteristics and, more precisely, their weaknesses.

3\. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND THE POTENTIAL DAMAGE TO THE COMPETITIVE
PROCESS

Even if [this]{.underline} advantage is based on merits and should not
be sanctioned based on competition rules, it [is an **obstacle** to a
level playing field and is likely to **tip the market**
towards]{.underline} a situation of [**overwhelming** and]{.underline}
possibly **[perennial dominance]{.underline}**. Indeed, this advantage
may mean that a new entrant could not immediately be as efficient as the
dominant firm. [The market would]{.underline} then **[no longer be
contestable]{.underline}** in the economic sense of the term. The
advantage in terms of [A.I. and computational capacity
would]{.underline} likely [become an **impassable barrier** to
entry]{.underline}. The damage would perhaps not be damage in terms of
efficiency (both for the economy and for the consumer) or innovation,
but damage to the competition process itself (3.1). Simultaneously, [the
use of A.I.]{.underline} in an oligopolistic market structure [can lead
to the faster emergence of **collusive equilibria**]{.underline}, which
are more stable, insofar as competing firms gain a better understanding
of the market and can predict their common reactions more and more
precisely (3.2).

3.1 The locking of a dominant position

In such a case, the use of A.I. is aimed less at exploiting an advantage
vis-à-vis the consumer than at acquiring, consolidating or extending a
dominant position to the detriment of its current competitors or
potential competitors, whether in the same relevant market or related
markets (of complementary goods and services, for example). The
practices in question may be favourable to the consumer in terms of
welfare, at least in the short term. They may nevertheless be
detrimental to the continuation of free, undistorted competition on the
merits.

[Dominant]{.underline} Internet [firms]{.underline} may [have a
**competitive advantage** over their current or future competitors and
their trading partners]{.underline}, in other words, firms that act as
complementors in their respective ecosystems (Marty and Warin 2020c,
2020a). **[[Abundant lit]{.mark}erature]{.underline}** in economics and
management sciences [[is developing on **kill zones**]{.mark}
and]{.underline} the notion of [**killer mergers** or]{.underline}
consolidating **[acquisitions]{.underline}** (Marty and Warin 2020e).
The possession of **[[massive]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[continuously
renewed]{.underline}**, [and **diversified [data]{.mark}**
[and]{.mark}]{.underline} the design of **[A.I.
[algorithms]{.mark}]{.underline}** coupled with the development of
computational resources [can [enable dominant
companies]{.mark}]{.underline} (the pivotal firms of each ecosystem)
[[to]{.mark} identify competitive threats]{.underline}, promising
technologies or potentially disruptive developments [at a **very early**
stage]{.underline}. Therefore, [they can **[eliminate]{.mark}** or
**[clone]{.mark}** the service [or]{.mark} even **[buy out]{.mark}** the
company]{.underline} concerned [**well before** entering the
market]{.underline}.

The consumer may not be harmed in the short term. A possible innovation
will not be eliminated; it can be integrated into the dominant firm\'s
offer and may be more efficient and attractive. However, the advanced
detection capability perpetuates dominance by acting as a barrier to
market entry. (**[Anticompetitive]{.underline}**) [**foreclosure**
arises from a capacity to **detect weak signals** in the
market]{.underline}. Different algorithmic tools facilitate these
nowcasting practices. Sentiment analysis is one of the main ones.

3.2 The emergence and consolidation of algorithmic collusions

The practices described above correspond to unilateral practices, i.e.
practices implemented by a dominant firm independently of its
competitors. [[Algorithms]{.underline}]{.mark} in general and A.I., in
particular, [can]{.underline} also [facilitate]{.underline} development,
if not the emergence of **[collusive equilibria]{.underline}**. Once
again, [**abundant literature** has developed on the
question]{.underline} of the ability of A.I. to promote and stabilize
tacit collusion equilibria (Calvano et al., 2019). These are situations
in which [algorithms capable of autonomous machine learning]{.underline}
by understanding the functioning of the market and the reactions of
competitors [[**spontaneously converge** towards a **cooperative
equilibrium**]{.underline}]{.mark} (i.e., armed peace) insofar as this
is the one that maximizes everyone\'s profits over the long term.

Human players would potentially arrive at the same result, but under
much more restrictive assumptions (in terms of the number of
participants, the complexity of the environment, etc.) and over a much
more extended period. Moreover, such an equilibrium would be much more
stable with A.I. than with humans insofar as the former could present
less cognitive bias, leading them to misinterpret their competitors\'
strategies or overreact in case of observed deviation from the tacit
collusion equilibrium. Moreover, the demonstration of an anticompetitive
intention would be much more challenging to make, which would likely
significantly reduce the probability of being sanctioned by competition
rules (Marty 2017).

Finally, **[despite]{.underline}** the [efficiency gains]{.underline}
that A.I. will bring and the development of computational capabilities,
the [academic literature **insists** on the associated
**risks**]{.underline}. Thus, the race towards A.I. would not only be
the solution to the search for efficiency in our algorithm-driven
economies; it could also prove to be a future problem. Our fourth
section shows that [while A.I. may be a **problem**]{.underline}, [it
may also be the **solution** to control these possible
risks]{.underline}. However, it is a question of considering these
avenues in their practical, legal and ethical dimensions.

4\. AVENUES FOR **[ALGORITHM [REGULATION BY
ALGORITHMS]{.mark}]{.underline}**

The tools provided by A.I. [[can]{.mark} help to
**[correct]{.mark}**]{.underline} their possible
**[[anticompetitive]{.underline}]{.mark}** or harmful
**[[effects]{.underline}]{.mark}** on consumers. They can be implemented
by the competition regulator (4.1) or by consumers themselves (4.2).

4.1 The use of artificial intelligence by market supervisors to prevent
manipulative strategies

The resources provided by the [A.I. can be used **ex-ante** as [part
of]{.mark} **algorithm [validation procedures]{.mark}**]{.underline} (in
a logic of requiring conformity by design) or as part of sectoral
surveys. The [algorithms are]{.underline} then [used [based on **market
data**]{.mark}]{.underline} transmitted by companies [[to
**observe**]{.mark} **possible [biases]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[[In]{.mark} the case of **[collusion]{.mark}** by
algorithms]{.underline}, [[these]{.mark} checks could [function as
**stress tests**]{.mark}]{.underline}. It would be a matter of
[[seeing]{.mark} **under what [conditions]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} **with
what [speed]{.mark}** the competing firms\' algorithms could converge
towards such equilibria [through]{.mark} **algorithmic [collusion
incubators]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It would be up to the regulator and
the firms to define the conditions (speed or frequency of price changes,
for example) to limit competitive risks.

Then, the [algorithms [can be used]{.mark} **ex-post** [in **market
surveillance**]{.mark}]{.underline}. As is already the case in financial
market regulation for high-frequency transactions, [it is possible [to
**analyze**]{.mark} **market [patterns]{.mark}** to detect strategies
that **would not make economic sense** outside of abusive
practice]{.underline}. It is then up to the company concerned to prove
that its decisions were not part of such a strategy (the logic of
complying or explain). Note that competition law is not the only legal
tool that can make algorithms accountable. For example, when it comes to
offers to final consumers (in terms of price or quality of the products
offered), practices of a discriminatory nature could be subject to
consumer protection measures how so many unfair or misleading practices.
However, it should be noted that the finer the analysis produced by the
algorithm of the customer\'s needs and characteristics, the more
difficult it will be to detect manipulation and detect damage.

The Stigler Centre (2019, p.254) proposes some avenues discussed in its
paper. [A **concealed dark pattern**]{.underline} that increases
consumers\' exit costs or is likely to exploit weaker consumers\'
weaknesses [must be subject to a **presumption of consumer
harm**]{.underline}. In other words, [manipulative intent would be
**presumed**]{.underline} if the algorithm\'s design appears to obscure
the developer\'s intent and its effects intentionally. The practices
referred to by the Stigler Center (2019) are worth discussing,
particularly concerning the development of A.I.

4.2 The use of **[a]{.underline}**rtificial
**[i]{.underline}**ntelligence by consumers

Consumers themselves [can use algorithmic tools to **detect** or
**counteract possible manipulation** by firms]{.underline}. This can be
done through **[distributed monitoring devices]{.underline}** set up by
non-profit institutions [or]{.underline} through **[over-the-counter
algorithms]{.underline}** by consumers themselves. The latter [can
**play** with firms\' algorithmic strategies or even **deceive** them by
emitting false signals]{.underline}.

It should be noted that all consumers\' segments are not equivalent to
algorithmic manipulations and the responses they are likely to make to
them. First, the probability of being manipulated even by a mild dark
pattern depends on the consumer\'s level of knowledge (i.e., often their
level of education). Thus, the ability to perceive the manipulation
itself also depends on the consumer\'s level of knowledge (i.e., often
their level of education). Second, access even to such countermeasures
is related to the same characteristics. In other words, possible
algorithmic manipulations will not affect different categories of
consumers in the same way, which raises both ethical (Marty and Warin
2020d) and distributional issues.

Consumers may misperceive the use of A.I. by platforms. The
personalization of prices and offers can be analyzed as discrimination
aimed at \"exploitative abuse.\" The \"guiding\" of choice behaviour,
especially if perceived as part of a dark pattern, can be interpreted as
an unfair and prejudicial manipulative practice (deceptive practices).
In doing so, a phenomenon of consumer backlash can be observed (Stigler
Center, 2019). This may result in measured but still damaging strategies
on the part of firms. The use of less obvious dark nudges (mild dark
patterns) may make it possible to obtain the desired effects in the most
naïve consumers without alienating the most informed consumers who could
react negatively towards the operator if aggressive dark patterns are
used. Paradoxically, the consumers are least exposed to dark patterns
that are likely to pose a credible threat against the firms that would
use them. The more exposed consumers are, the less likely to respond to
them, the less they can identify them. Moreover, targeting the
vulnerabilities of specific segments of consumers increases the
effectiveness of manipulation to the detriment of the most vulnerable
consumers.

[It is]{.underline}, therefore, [a question of **forcing** firms to be
**accountable** for algorithms despite their opacity]{.underline} (black
box logic) [through [**regulation** by the **spotlight**]{.mark} that
can **[raise reputational issues]{.mark}**]{.underline}
([[encouraging]{.mark} the [development of **responsible
A.I**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}) [and]{.underline} of [encouraging the
emergence of **[algorithmic combats]{.mark}** that]{.underline} allow
consumers to [[exercise **countervailing competitive
power**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### Both of those cause extinction.

collected, stored, analyzed, and disseminated every day both for and
during war. Such [a massive data enterprise is **vulnerable to
abuse**]{.underline} in ways that have so far gone under-appreciated. As
a group of researchers recently noted that the use of AI could threaten
"digital security", "physical security", and "political security." Among
other things, the use of [[AI]{.underline}]{.mark} to automate tasks
involved in surveillance, persuasion, and deception "[may [**expand**

[and]{.mark} **social [manipulation]{.mark}**]{.underline}."50
[When]{.underline} Elon [Musk warns of AI [as humanity's]{.mark}
"**[biggest existential threat]{.mark}**"]{.underline} comparing it to
"summoning a demon,"51 [one **[should not limit]{.mark}** their
imagination [to]{.mark} **only [a rogue killer

institutions and [[**intuitions** while **eviscerating**]{.mark}
fundamental [protections on]{.mark} **human
[dignity]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[Such an ecosphere is **exacerbated** by the involvement of **private
partners**]{.underline} in these projects. Indeed, the U.S. military "a
latecomer to the AI revolution, and government spending on AI is dwarfed
by the private industry."52 [[The military]{.mark} is]{.underline} thus
[**forced to [rely]{.mark}** [on private companies who bring]{.mark}
with them not only **[large]{.mark} sets of**]{.underline} structured

**problematic commercial practices** in utilizing such

**even bigger** and **more dangerous** to our liberties and democratic

years ago.53 The new complex raises questions about the very ability,
let alone desire, of the government to adequately protect international
human rights, civil liberties, and digital freedoms in the production of
these AI applications and technologies. It is worth recalling that even
before the AI revolution, experts were already ringing the alarm bells
on U.S. privatization of intelligence----suggesting that such
outsourcing has "gone too far."54 We now therefore find ourselves in a
particularly peculiar position. As highlighted by Melody Guan:

"Another challenge the United States faces in exercising judicious
public authority in tech is the particularly outsized political
influence of its large corporations. These play a deciding role in
determining American society's economic and political policies by means
of campaign contributions, lobbying, access to and representation of
corporate elite amongst politicians, and rights of corporate personhood.
Today it is no longer even clear where the line between the public
sector and the corporate sector ends. On one hand, the autonomy of
private tech companies allows for a check against government overreach.
Corporations can resist military involvement, government censorship, and
assistance with federal investigations\... On the other hand, the
corporatocracy makes it difficult for the government to reign its tech
companies on behalf of its citizens, even if it were become interested
in and adept at AI policy.... \[T\]here has been little material change
to the existing manners of transgressive harvesting and utilization of
user data \[by AI developing tech giants\]. The poor regard for personal
protection and rights in the current unregulated state of affairs shows
us that we cannot simply rely on the goodwill of tech companies. Indeed,
the nature of corporations themselves may expose them to lawsuits if
they fail to prioritize the interests of their shareholders over
debatable moral concerns. We need a citizen-centric government to
shepherd the ethical and fair use of technology."55

However, in spite of the reported enthusiasm, [there is [**growing
evidence** of]{.mark} unfair, unjustified and [discriminatory]{.mark}
effects of]{.underline} these **[[algorithms]{.underline}]{.mark}** for
individuals and wider communities \[1, 11, 27\]. Eubanks \[10\] offers a
vivid example of devastating effects of automated eligibility systems
implemented in a particular type of transformative services (social
support services):

"Across the country, [[poor and working-class people]{.mark} are
targeted by new tools]{.underline} of digital poverty management [and
[face **life-threatening consequences**]{.mark}]{.underline} as a
result. [Automated eligibility [systems discourage]{.mark} them from
[claiming]{.mark} **public [resources]{.mark}**]{.underline} that they
need to survive and thrive... [Predictive models and [algorithms tag
them as **risky**]{.mark}]{.underline} investments [and
**problematic**]{.underline} parents. [Vast complexes of **social
services**, **law enforcement**, and **neighborhood surveillance** [make
their every move visible and offer up]{.mark} their [behavior
for]{.mark} government, commercial, and public
[scrutiny]{.mark}]{.underline}" \[10, p. 11\].

[**Law enforcement** is]{.underline} another prominent example of
transformative services [using algorithmic decision-making]{.underline},
most notably in predictive policing. Celebrated as the new era of
"data-driven scientific decision-making", [[predictive policing]{.mark}
has been **increasingly used** to inform decisions such as **arresting**
people or determining the length of their **sentence**, based on the
calculated probability of them committing future crimes]{.underline}
\[28\]. This practice relies on datafication of individuals, including a
variety of personal as well as other data that individuals may not have
any control over, such as past data on "gang districts" or post codes.
Consequently, [individuals are assigned "**risk scores**"]{.underline}
that are subsequently [used for decision-making in a **variety of
contexts**. The practice [is **spreading**]{.mark} with **more** and
**more departments** embracing the scientific approach to
policing]{.underline}. For example, Ferguson \[28\] reveals that almost
400,000 Chicago citizens now have an official police risk score:

"[This algorithm]{.underline} -- still [[**secret** and]{.mark}
**publicly [unaccountable]{.mark}**]{.underline} -- [**shapes policing
strategy**, the **use of force**, and threatens to **alter suspicion**
on the streets. It is]{.underline} also [the **future** of big data
policing]{.underline} in America -- [and]{.underline} depending on how
you see it, either an innovative approach to violence reduction or [a
**terrifying example** of data-driven social control]{.underline}" \[27,
p. 1\].

In addition to citizens not being aware of their risk scores, Ferguson
\[28\] warns that "\[c\]urrently [[there is **no public
oversight**]{.mark} of the police data, inputs or outputs, [so
communities are]{.mark} **left in the dark** [unable to **audit** or
**challenge**]{.mark} any individual threat score]{.underline}" (p. 1).
Consequently, the "profound benefits" of predictive policing continue to
be celebrated in the popular press. For example, in a controversial
Financial Times article Gilian Tett (a respected financial reporter)
offers the following support for predictive policing: "After all, ...the
algorithms in themselves are neutral" \[29, p. 1\].

Similar examples are reported in other types of transformative services
including education, healthcare, social support and disability services
(see for example, \[1, 10, 11, 27, 30\]). In particular, Caplan and
colleagues \[1\] warn, "[there is a need for **greater reflection** on
models of power and control, where the sublimation of human
decisionmaking to algorithms **erodes trust** in experts]{.underline}"
(p. 6). There is a growing number of critical studies of algorithmic
decision-making emerging across a range of disciplines including
sociology, public policy, communications and media studies, political
studies, and increasingly information systems (see for example, \[6, 12,
13\]). We contribute to the existing body of knowledge by proposing a
novel approach to [framing the]{.underline} problem of [negative
consequences of algorithmic decision-making as **[algorithmic
pollution]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

4 Algorithmic Pollution

Having outlined some of the negative consequences of automated
algorithmic decisionmaking in transformative services we now frame the
problem situation using the lens of pollution. The pollution concept is
suitable since it [allows us to [see]{.mark} algorithms as a **force for
good** while recognizing that there are both **intended** and
**[unintended negative consequences]{.mark}** that affect individuals,
communities and society]{.underline}. It would be hard to argue that
electricity is not a good thing, but if its generation causes pollution
in the form of global warming then remedial action and regulation are
needed. We note that using the concept of pollution as a framing device
is not new: for example, there has been research defining crime as
pollution (CAP) \[31\].

4.1 Defining Algorithmic Pollution

According to a broad definition "Environmental pollution is the
discharge of material, in any physical state, that is dangerous to the
environment or human health" \[32\]. (Encyclopedia.com). Similarly, the
Encyclopedia Britannica defines environmental pollution as: "the
addition of any substance (solid, liquid, or gas) or any form of energy
(such as heat, sound, or radioactivity) to the environment at a rate
faster than it can be dispersed, diluted, decomposed, recycled, or
stored in some harmless form" \[33\].

[When algorithms produce negative consequences]{.underline} on
individual or collective wellbeing, [and when such consequences cannot
be **effectively detected** and **eliminated** or **dealt
with**]{.underline}, we argue that [[they '**contaminate**']{.mark} our
sociomaterial environment]{.underline}. We call this phenomenon
algorithmic pollution and define it as follows:

[Algorithmic pollution denotes the presence of **unjustified**,
**unfair**, **discriminatory**, or other **harmful consequences** of
algorithmic decision-making for]{.underline} individuals, groups,
organizations, sections of the population, the economy, or
[society]{.underline} at large.

While our definition of algorithmic pollution accords with the view of
pollution as harms suffered by living organisms caused by exposure to
pollutants \[31\], the scientific definition of pollution is concerned
with the presence of chemicals in the environment at a concentration
above their normal background level that perturb the environment in a
way that is harmful \[34\]. Harrison \[34\] also points out that not all
instances of pollution involve the addition of chemicals to the
environment; pollution can also be caused by adding to naturally
occurring phenomena, such as light and noise. The scientific definition
suggests that there is some background level of pollution that is
acceptable. [Since algorithms are probabilistic then some error in the
form of false positives and false negatives is
**unavoidable**]{.underline}, i.e., [[there will always be
**some**]{.mark} **level** of background algorithmic [pollution]{.mark}.
The challenge is to [detect when]{.mark} the outcomes of algorithmic
decision-making [**exceed a threshold** and result in]{.mark}
**systematic injustice**]{.underline} (individual decisions) [and
**larger**, **systemic [social injustice]{.mark}**]{.underline}
(emergent societal effects). While there must inevitably be a
substantial element of subjectivity in this judgment for algorithms it
is also present with environmental pollution where acceptable limits
(e.g., parts per million) have to be established to calibrate a 'normal'
background level.

Drawing on Lynch and colleagues \[31\], we note that the pollution
literature distinguishes between an 'end-pipe' (e.g., a factory chimney)
and the process that generates the pollution (e.g., a manufacturing
process). Further, end-pipes are a stationary source of pollution, while
pollution itself is mobile and it is not always possible to know the
source of pollution from monitoring the environment. Pollution can be
generated as point source pollution (PSP) and nonpoint source (NPSP).
While a factory chimney is a PSP, motor vehicles, which pollute the
environment by generating particles and nitrogen dioxide while in
standing traffic, are an example of NPSP.

4.2 Generation and Spreading of Algorithmic Pollution

[For algorithmic pollution to occur there **must** be
**data**]{.underline} (input) [to feed the algorithms]{.underline} and
the algorithms must lead to decisions (output). [Algorithms **only**
have the capability to produce pollution when they are used to automate
decisions based on **datafied individuals**]{.underline}, i.e., data,
algorithms, and decisions are always present and implicated in
algorithmic pollution (even when this is not readily apparent). Using
this production metaphor and concepts from the environmental pollution
literature, we identify necessary elements that work together in the
case of AI and machine-learning algorithms:

Datafication: algorithms are constructed using 'datafied' individuals
i.e., individuals represented by limited number of attributes that have
been chosen as relevant. As they are never complete, such a datafication
practice is bound to create the so-called "representational" harm
\[35\]. This type of harm is further intensified with organisations
(including governments) increasingly acquiring data from "data scorers
and brokers" with individuals already datafied (e.g., a person's score)
through some unknown processes \[15, 27\].

Production: in the case of machine learning, algorithms then learn from
the data produced as a result of datafication to create rules. However,
using past data to predict future behaviour is sometimes out-dated or
inappropriate. For example, data collected on historical "gang
districts" are now used by police for predictive policing even though
these districts may be no longer representative \[28\]. As O'Neil \[11\]
observes: "if we allowed a model to be used for college admissions in
1870, we'd still have 0.7% of women going to college. Thank goodness we
didn't have big data back then" (p. 1). Therefore, an algorithm might be
designed in such a way that it discriminates against certain
individuals, or it might learn from data to discriminate.

End-Pipes: algorithms are embedded in processes in transformative
services of all types in order to make decisions with little or no human
intervention. In the language of environmental pollution, this is the
'end-pipe' of algorithmic pollution, i.e., the point where decisions are
made and enacted. Some of these decisions may result from point
stationary pollution (PSP), where the decisions are generated by an
identifiable organization, process, and algorithm. Other decisions are
likely to have characteristics of non-stationary pollution (NPSP), being
generated by multiple algorithm sources working collectively (for
example decision generated by networks of intercommunicating
algorithms).

Consequences: [algorithmic decision-making]{.underline} in the
transformative services [has a **direct impact** on individuals, for
example when a person is approved or declined for]{.underline} a loan, a
medical operation, or **[parole]{.underline}**. [Algorithmic pollution
is further propagated and amplified by **highly interconnected systems**
of algorithms]{.underline} (NPSP). How these individual algorithms
interact is not only invisible to those affected, but often to those who
constructed them and deployed them \[19, 36\]. For example, a person
with a poor credit card history is very likely to have difficulties
finding employment; without a job they are very unlikely to repay their
debt, which in turn will further impact on their credit card history
\[27\]. Teachers being scored by algorithms as non-performing will face
difficulties finding future employment, which in turn will limit their
ability to improve their score \[11\]. In environmental pollution this
is unlikely to be the case as, for example, radiation and water
pollution do not augment each other. [Algorithmic
[pollution]{.mark}]{.underline}, however, [[emerges from complex
interactions that **cannot be predicted**]{.mark} and possibly **cannot
be traced back** to root decisions]{.underline}, i.e., [a **[cause and
effect logic may be insufficient]{.mark}** when addressing complex
algorithmic pollution]{.underline}.

Feedback Loops: the [algorithmic decision-making outcomes]{.underline}
themselves [lead to the generation of further data about individuals
that can be harvested by machines and **fed back** into the algorithm
building process. Not only can [humans]{.mark} be [removed from]{.mark}
the **[decision-making]{.mark} process**; they [can also be removed
from]{.mark} the **algorithm [building]{.mark} process** as machines
learn from data that was generated by machine-made
decisions]{.underline} in the first place. [Without some form of
**intervention** these [feedback loops]{.mark} may [result in
**self-perpetuating vicious cycles**, which]{.mark} may]{.underline},
ultimately, [[lead to **deep rifts** in the **fabric of
society**]{.underline}]{.mark}. These feedback loops are thus unique to
algorithmic pollution in that the consequences can affect the means of
production in a direct and automated manner through datafication and
machine learning, aided and amplified by data brokers and data scorers
\[27\]. [The end result is **pollution itself becoming a pollutant**,
producing **new forms** of pollutions]{.underline}. This is a new
digital phenomenon, not present in environmental pollution.

4.3 Implications

Algorithmic pollution is not only spreading but also intensifying. While
in other cases of pollution humans and/or instruments are capable of
detecting pollution (e.g., through sight, smell, or by radiation
reading), algorithmic pollution remains hidden. Indeed, algorithmic
effects are hidden and as such very hard to detect and prove. A customer
of a health insurance company offers a vivid example:

"The insurance company repeatedly told me that the problem was the
result of a technical error, a few missing digits in a database. But
that's the thing about being targeted by an algorithm: you get a sense
of a pattern in the digital noise, an electronic eye turned towards you,
but you can't put your finger on exactly what's amiss" \[10, p. 5\].

Moreover, it is very difficult (if possible at all) for an individual to
fight the effects of algorithms. In fact, "bad inferences" about people
are fast becoming "a larger problem than bad data because companies can
represent them as "opinions" rather than fact. A lie can be litigated,
but an opinion is much harder to prove false" \[27, p. 32\]. To make
matters worse, algorithmic decision-making continues to be celebrated as
superior to human-judgment \[10, 11, 37\]. The cult of "science"
continues as "Technocrats and managers cloak contestable value
judgements in the grab of "science" \[27, p. 10\]. Inevitably, and often
unknowingly, they also contribute to the creation and propagation of
pollution.

As algorithms now proliferate into various sectors of the economy and
society they fundamentally reconfigure power relations and transform the
ways sectors operate, without public awareness or broader understanding
of their consequences. Given the potentially complex outcomes of
algorithmic pollution, focusing on and opening up the 'black box' of how
algorithms work (the production stage), is unlikely to be a successful
strategy for algorithmic regulation. The lack of transparency, the
hidden acting of algorithms, and the presence of feedback make the study
of algorithmic pollution particularly challenging.

5 Theorizing Algorithmic Pollution

Contemporary forms of knowing, in particular those advanced by computer
and communication technology research, artificial intelligence, data
analytics and data science, are focused on the translation of problems
(business, market, political, scientific) into codified knowledge and
ultimately codes of algorithms. A considerable body of literature thus
focuses on translations: first, the translation of tasks (or problem
solutions) into formal statements or instructions (pseudo-code); and
second, the translation of the pseudo-code into a source code \[19, p.
17\]. The first translation is particularly critical as it essentially
codifies existing knowledge about a problem at hand in such a way that
all possible conditions relevant for solving it (e.g., variables in a
decision-making model) and for generating decisions are taken into
account. Algorithms that have errors in the codified knowledge (logic or
control or both) produce wrong or problematic outcomes \[38\] and can
thus be identified as and shown to be pollutants.

However, algorithmic pollution occurs more often due to negative
unintended consequences of carefully designed and seemingly correct
algorithms. As examples above illustrate, the execution of algorithms
involves mobilization and use of diverse data sources (e.g., shopping
history data, prescription drugs, medical and wellness data, social
media records, search engine logs/history, voting preferences, credit
card transactions and many more, often sold by data brokers who
consolidate data per individuals). These data are prone to errors, are
uncertain, and contain a significant amount of noise \[15\]. Based on
such data, algorithms calculate scores, make decisions or produce other
outcomes (risk scores for individuals, loan or insurance
approvals/declines, short listing of job applicants) that become
effective in concrete sociomaterial practices: individuals are targeted
as criminal suspects based on risk scores; bank clients are declined
loans; applicants are not short listed. Such effects can be damaging
while typically not being justified \[10, 27\].

The consequences of the algorithmic execution thus depend to a large
extent on numerous heterogeneous actors enrolled in complex and
uncertain sociomaterial assemblages. These consequences are rarely
predictable and detectable at the design and coding stage. While
understanding the reasoning embedded in the code of an algorithm and how
outcomes (decisions) are calculated and derived from inputs, is
important and necessary, it is far from being sufficient to comprehend
what an algorithm is actually doing, on what grounds its decisions are
produced and whether they are correct, fair, just, and justified. As
algorithms become actors they "form a complex and at various times
interpenetrating sociomaterial assemblage\[s\] that \[are\] diffused,
distributed, fragmented, and, most importantly, "liquid" \[39, pp.
18--19\]. Their effects are produced by the sociomaterial assemblages.
To understand algorithmic pollution, we argue, requires empirical
attention to the workings of individual algorithms or systems of
algorithms and the examination within their complex, diffused,
fragmented, liquid and often interpenetrating sociomaterial assemblages
\[40\]. This proposition opens many conceptual and methodological
questions.

The notion of an algorithm as "Logic + Control" \[18\] or a set of
instructions for completing a particular set of tasks \[1\], implies a
self-sufficient non-human object with specified functions with defined
inputs, a complete set of conditions and action possibilities
(outcomes). When its code (a set of instructions) is executed an
algorithm becomes the actor. In other words, the execution of code
constitutes an algorithm as an actor. Code execution is a particular
materialization of relations that form sociomaterial assemblages
(mobilize and enact heterogeneous actants -- servers, various data sets,
other algorithms, things and human actors as objects of knowledge). It
is through these relations that particular outcomes (decisions,
recommendations) are achieved (credit scores calculated; crime suspect
regions demarcated; terrorists predicted). How to study these enfolding
relations becomes the key methodological issue, an issue that is yet
further complicated by the ability of machines to learn from data
without human input and, due to the use of deep learning, may be unable
to fully account for the "Logic" that is being used to automate
decisions \[18, 19\].

Through repeated execution algorithm codes keep performing their objects
of knowledge and thus enact different entities (things and people) into
being. They perform new distinctions and new categories of
customers/clients/citizens often based on unchecked and error prone
data, from dubious and unreliable sources \[15\]. Mackenzie and
Vurdubakis \[41\] similarly note:

"the conduct of code, we might say, its execution, is a fraught event,
and analysis should be brought to bear on the conditions and practices
that allow code to, as it were, access conduct. While the knowledge or
form that lies at the heart of the code promises completeness and
decidability, the execution of code is often mired in ambiguity,
undecidability and incompleteness" (p. 7).

Importantly, "ambiguity, undecidability and incompleteness" are kept
hidden, buried in the complexity of code execution and largely
unrecognized. Even the designers and users of algorithms (especially
those with learning capabilities) do not understand the intricacies of
code execution and cannot explain the resulting outcomes which are
nevertheless actioned undoubted and undisputed.

This brief discussion suggests that to understand the actual doings of
algorithms we need first to examine and dig deeper into the relational
unfolding of code execution (a digital life of code) and the emergence
of sociomaterial assemblages (the intra-acting in Barad's \[42\] sense),
including the mobilization of numerous actors (data sets, companies,
internet, data analytics technologies) and the performing of subjects
and objects. The relational unfolding of a code however is hidden behind
the interface and the traces of code execution are typically not
provided.

When the algorithmic outcomes become enacted they continue the 'doing'
by being enrolled in sociomaterial practices of the users (for example,
in a police department or in a bank loan approval process). Entangled
within these practices algorithmic outcomes have a life of their own,
reconfiguring users' action domains while becoming constitutive of
subjects (suspect citizens or risky clients) and objects (high
criminality regions). [Algorithmic outcomes]{.underline} thus
[perform]{.underline} what Barad \[42\] calls **[agential
cuts]{.underline}**, making particular subjects and objects in the image
of their calculation. For instance, the [subjects]{.underline}
(citizens, clients, job applicants) [become]{.underline} performed as
**[particular calculated figures]{.underline}** (e.g., [citizens
**equated** with their risk scores]{.underline}), [the **power** of
which comes from an **unquestioned authority** of
algorithms]{.underline} \[43\].

[These]{.underline} performative [effects of algorithms]{.underline} are
not only taken for granted, they are celebrated as unbiased, objective
and thus fair \[11\]. That they [are based on **unchecked** and
**uncertain data sets**]{.underline}, often **[breaching basic human
rights]{.underline}**, and thus unjustified, unethical, and potentially
illegal, is conveniently hidden and kept far from the public eye.
[Algorithmic pollution]{.underline}, we might tentatively conclude,
[is]{.underline} carefully covered up, **[systematically
hidden]{.underline}**, and deceivingly dressed up as technological
progress.

These initial ideas, conceptualizations and methodological issues only
scratch the surface of unprecedented methodological complexity of
investigating algorithmic pollution. Uncovering it, revealing how
algorithms pollute various sociomaterial environments and what
injustices and damages are done to people and communities, will be an
uphill battle for anybody who dares to research and report on it.

In this battle we can learn from ANT scholars who have studied similar
reconfigurations of sociomaterial practices and the performing of
subjects and objects in a variety of contexts (see for example,
\[44--47\]). What is however different and new in algorithmic doing and
performing is the particular discursive-calculative-digital nature of
algorithmic outcomes and how they come into being in code execution. For
this reason, ANT or other field methodologies would need to be adapted
or reinvented to be delicately attuned to diffused, fragmented,
uncertain and hidden sociomaterial practices of algorithmic doings and
reality making.

6 A Research Agenda for Algorithmic Pollution

As we have shown, in addition to investigating the design of algorithms
(that has been extensively studied in the literature, see \[18, 43\],
[researching and understanding algorithmic pollution requires
**empirical examination** of]{.underline} interrelated sociomaterial
practices of two key aspects: algorithm deployments and ongoing
datafication processes. Both aspects offer new research challenges, as
discussed in this section.

Algorithm **[deployment]{.underline}** includes on the one hand,
[**coding**, **execution** of code]{.underline} and emergence of a
sociomaterial assemblage that produce algorithmic pollution,
[and]{.underline} on the other, [the **enactment** of algorithmic
outcomes]{.underline} ([**decisions**, **recommendations**]{.underline})
that reconfigures users' practices and performs subjects and objects.
The need to better understand how these sociomaterial practices of
algorithm deployment contribute to algorithmic pollution, leads us to a
number of research questions.

For example, what is the relationship between coding practices and
algorithmic pollution? We envisage the design of [**new frameworks** and
**methods** that could be used to]{.underline} guide developers to
[**bring to the surface** potential sources of algorithmic pollution,
including datafication practices]{.underline}. An important step in this
direction is the IEEE Global Initiative on Ethics of Autonomous and
Intelligence Systems \[48\]. We envisage the challenge of translating
the proposed generic principles into practical approaches in a
particular context, taking into account the complexities of
transformative services. These yet-to-be-discovered practices, could
include for example moral imagining \[49\].

The challenge of making visible the process of emergence of a
sociomaterial assemblage that produces algorithmic pollution opens yet
more research questions. For example: How might we effectively
recognize, report and mitigate the effects of algorithmic pollution
throughout society? Who should be doing it? How might we recognise and
deal with different types of polluters? How can we educate governments,
organisations and society at large to look beyond the current hype of
algorithmic neutrality, efficiency and superiority and comprehend the
urgency of dealing with algorithmic pollution?

In framing a response to algorithmic pollution, we propose to turn our
attention and learn from the established field of environmental justice,
which is defined as follows:

"Environmental justice is a social movement seeking to address the
inequitable distribution of environmental hazards among the poor and
minorities. ... From a policy perspective, practicing environmental
justice entails ensuring that all citizens receive from the government
the same degree of protection from environmental hazards and that
minority and underprivileged populations do not face inequitable
environmental burdens." \[50, p. 1\].

We propose that algorithmic pollution is added to the environmental
dimensions already identified in the environmental justice movement, as
algorithmic justice. As previously illustrated, [there is **already
strong evidence** that the hazards of algorithms are distributed
**inequitably**]{.underline}. As Eubanks \[10\] explains, [these new
algorithmic systems for "automating inequality" have the **most
destructive** and **deadly** effects on the **poor** and the
**underprivileged**]{.underline}. Even more, "\[t\]he **[widespread
use]{.underline}** of these systems **[impacts the quality of democracy
for us all]{.underline}**" \[10, p. 12\].

The environmental justice agenda is reflected in the Toronto Declaration
\[51\], which is calling for governments and companies to ensure that
algorithms respect basic principles of equality and non-discrimination.
Yet, as our paper demonstrates, this is going to be very difficult to
implement in practice, as today's algorithms are so "deeply woven into
the fabric of social life that, most of the time, we don't even notice
we are being watched and analysed" \[10, p. 5\].

A possible way forward could be found by simultaneously looking forward
at the emerging developments in AI and algorithmic decision-making and
looking back at the history of the environmental movement. For example,
a possible way of providing more visibility into the inner working of
algorithms would be to store the trace of automated algorithmic
decisions using a blockchain, as suggested by Schmelzer \[52\]. This has
the benefit of the decision audit trail being stored in a way that can
be shared, cannot be tampered with, and is not owned by the algorithm
producer or deployer. A similar idea might be applied to the problem of
spreading pollution by creating an audit trail for the ongoing
datafication of individuals in transformative services.

[[By considering]{.underline}]{.mark} the history of environmental
protection, we could also learn, for example, about [[the ways]{.mark}
in which **[traditional pollution]{.mark}** has [been
addressed]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[We could]{.underline}]{.mark} then
expand or [[redevelop]{.mark} the **existing frameworks** and
**methods**, such as]{.underline} Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA)
\[53\] and **[[market]{.mark}-based [controls]{.mark}]{.underline}**
\[31\], [[to include **algorithmic pollution**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Finally, by researching the inner working of government environmental
protection agencies we may identify new opportunities for policy
development and possible establishment of similar agencies for
algorithmic justice.

7 Conclusion and an Urgent Call for Action

In his work titled "Love Your Monsters", Latour turns his attention to
technology "to protect the planet from ecological crisis" \[54, p. 1\].
We argue that [a **new type of crisis** is already here, caused
by]{.underline} a new type of technologically-induced pollution that we
identify and name "[algorithmic pollution]{.underline}".

Inspired by the observed parallels with environmental pollution, in this
paper we articulate a new type of widespread, hidden, largely
unregulated and evidently harmful "algorithmic pollution". Focusing on
the transformative services, we offer evidence collected from
multidisciplinary literature why [this]{.underline} pollution [is a
**growing problem** that requires our **urgent attention**]{.underline}.
We also offer a preliminary approach to studying algorithmic pollution
that discloses the hidden and uncertain performing of algorithms in
sociomaterial environments, which would enable researchers to examine
the nature of algorithmic pollution and how the damage is done. This
enables us to identify and articulate a set of IS research challenges
that call for our urgent attention. By drawing parallels between
environmental protection and the need to protect the observed
sociomaterial environment that is now affected by algorithmic pollution,
we open up new opportunities for a practical contribution.

We recognize that [algorithms **undoubtedly** have the potential to
provide society with **significant benefits**]{.underline} (e.g.,
healthcare, driverless vehicles, fraud detection). Therefore,
[this]{.underline} paper [is **not a treatise against
algorithms**]{.underline}. Far from it. [It is however **explicitly**
and **consciously against algorithmic pollution**]{.underline}.
Recalling the words of the poet Ella Wheeler Wilcox -- 'to sin by
silence, when we should protest" -- we, IS researchers, should raise our
voices and enact our professional responsibility.

Building upon the fundamental principle of environmental justice that
"all people deserve to live in a clean and safe environment free from
industrial waste and pollution that can adversely affect their
wellbeing" \[50, p. 1\], we conclude this paper with a claim that [[all
people]{.mark} equally [deserve to live]{.mark} in an environment
**free** and **[safe from algorithmic pollution]{.mark}**. If algorithms
are our **future**]{.underline}, as many claim, [then **understanding**,
**[fighting]{.mark} against** [and **preventing**]{.mark} algorithmic
pollution, [may **save our collective**]{.mark} **dignity** and
**[humanity]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

#### Dystopia outweighs everything.

**Harel and Brownsword, 19**---law professor at the Hebrew University of
Jerusalem AND Professor in Law at King\'s College London (Alon and
Roger, "Law, liberty and technology: criminal justice in the context of
smart machines," International Journal of Law in Context, Volume 15,
Special Issue 2, June 2019, pp. 107-125, dml) \[language modifications
denoted by brackets\]

Famously, Stephen Hawking (2018, p. 188) remarked that 'the advent of
super-intelligent AI would be either the best or the worst thing ever to
happen to humanity'. At best, smart machines, smart policing and smart
cities of the kind contemplated by Elizabeth Joh might signal the end of
crime; but, at worst, [we can imagine **various dystopian futures**
where the **existential** and **agential threats** presented by AI have
been **realised**]{.underline}. [Given]{.underline}, in James Bridle\'s
(2018, p. 2) words, [that our [technologies are **complicit** in 'an
**out-of-control**]{.mark} economic [system that **immiserates
many**]{.mark} and continues to **widen the gap** between rich and poor;
[the **collapse of**]{.mark} **political** and **societal
[consensus]{.mark}** across the globe resulting in **increasing
[nationalisms]{.mark}**[, **social divisions**, **ethnic conflicts** and
**shadow wars**; and a **warming climate**, which **existentially
threatens us all**']{.mark}, then]{.underline} Vincent Chiao might well
be right in claiming that [the turn to smart technology **might not be
the**]{.underline} smartest [**\[best\] way** of trying to achieve the
**end of crime**]{.underline}.

In this collection, our contributors have not highlighted concerns of an
existential nature. Nevertheless, we might fear that, in our quest for
crime-free societies, for greater safety and well-being, [we [will
**develop** and **embed**]{.mark} **ever more [intelligent
devices]{.mark}** to the point that [there is a risk of the **extinction
of humans**]{.mark} -- [or]{.mark}]{.underline}, if not that, then [a
risk of humanity surviving 'in some **highly suboptimal state** or in
which a large portion of [our potential]{.mark} for desirable
development [is **irreversibly squandered**']{.mark}]{.underline}
(Bostrom, 2014, p. 281, note 1; see also Ford, 2015). Our contributors
have not yet recommended that we should follow the example of Samuel
Butler\'s Erewhonians who, fearful for their liberty, destroyed their
machines (Butler, 1872) -- and who also, of course, inverted
conventional wisdom by punishing those who fell ill while, by contrast,
treating in hospital and sympathising with those who committed crimes
such as forging cheques, setting property on fire or robbing with
violence. Yet, the beauty of Erewhon is that, to some present-day
readers -- particularly readers who are familiar with, say, Harari\'s
Homo Deus (2016) 15 or Häggerström\'s Here be Dragons (2016) -- the
practices of the Erewhonians might seem to be anything but benighted.
[Is it **so ridiculous** to think that, with the **acceleration in
technological development**, machines might become **much smaller** and
**smarter**, capable of **reproducing themselves**, **communicating**
with one another and displaying various degrees of
**intelligence**]{.underline} (if not consciousness as humans experience
it) [and **agency**?]{.underline} Most importantly, [which policy would
be the more]{.underline} crazy [\[imprudent\]: to **disregard** machines
as a threat to the human condition or to [treat the threat as
**sufficiently serious** to warrant]{.mark} at least some
**[precautionary measures]{.mark}**]{.underline} -- albeit perhaps not
precaution on the scale exercised by the Erewhonians, who destroyed 'all
the inventions that had been discovered for the preceding 271 years'
(Butler, 1872, p. 260)?

Such, however, are not [the **most explicit concerns**]{.underline} of
our contributors. Rather, the concerns expressed by Bowling and Iyer, by
Lynskey and by Macdonald, Correia and Watkin [relate to our **agential
interests** and]{.underline}, in particular to our interests [in
**privacy**]{.underline}, in [the **fair collection** and **processing**
of our personal data and in **access** to (and the **integrity** of) the
informational eco-system]{.underline}. Increasingly, it is being
recognised that [such interests are '**contextual**' not only in the
sense that their demands might **vary** from one context to another, but
in the **more fundamental sense** that we have a **common interest** in
a context that **enables our self-development**]{.underline} (Hu, 2017;
Brincker, 2017). This is nicely expressed in a paper (discussing data
governance) from the Royal Society and British Academy:

'[Future concerns will likely relate to the **freedom** and **capacity**
to create conditions in which we can **flourish** as individuals;
**governance** will determine the **social**, **political**, **legal**
and **moral infrastructure** that gives each person a **sphere of
protection** through which they can **explore who they are**, **with
whom they want to relate** and **how they want to understand
themselves**, free from **intrusion** or **limitation** of
choice]{.underline}.' (Royal Society and British Academy, 2016, p. 5)

[With data being gathered]{.underline}, in both the public and the
private sector, [on an **unprecedented scale**]{.underline}
(Vaidhyanathan, 2011; Galloway, 2017), [we might [treat]{.mark} such
[dataveillance as **compromising the conditions for**]{.mark}
**self-development** and **[agency]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Pasquale,
2015). Moreover, we might fear that, [where data are used to **train
[smart machines that]{.mark} sift** and **[sort
citizens]{.mark}**]{.underline} (as mooted by the Chinese social credit
system) (Chen and Cheung, 2017), then, in Glen Greenwald\'s (2014, p. 6)
words, [this [could be the **precursor** to a]{.mark} **truly
[dystopian]{.mark}** ['system of **omnipresent monitoring** and
**control**']{.mark}]{.underline}.

Finally, there is the subtle and insidious way in [which smart machines
might compromise the **conditions for moral development**]{.underline}.
If we accept that the fundamental aspiration of any moral community is
that its members should try to do the right thing, then this presupposes
a process of moral reflection and action that accords with one\'s moral
judgment. Of course, this does not imply that each agent will make the
same moral judgment or apply the same reasons. A utilitarian community
is very different to a Kantian community; but, in both cases, these are
moral communities and it is their shared aspiration to do the right
thing that is the lowest common denominator (Brownsword, 2013; 2018a).
Arguably, **[[liberty]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- in the sense of [having
the **practical option** of doing both the **right** thing and the
**wrong** thing]{.underline} -- [is **critical** to moral
community]{.underline}. On the East coast, where crime is rife and where
prudential reasoning dominates, the moral project is poorly realised;
but it is at least a community with moral possibilities and with room
for moral improvement. By contrast, in the well-ordered technologically
managed West coast, if the possibility of moral community is lost, then,
as Beyleveld and Brownsword emphasise, this should certainly give us
pause about the direction of travel in the criminal justice system.

[The ability to do the right thing]{.underline} also
**[[hinges]{.underline}]{.mark}** not only on individual deliberation,
but also [[on]{.mark} **public [moral
deliberation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The [automated processes designed
to disable crime also]{.underline} typically mute and [disable public
moral deliberation. [If behaviour that]{.mark} previously [was]{.mark}
condemned and [prohibited has become **impossible**]{.mark} to engage
in]{.underline} (due to technological innovations), [[we are **less
likely** to debate it]{.mark}s justifiability]{.underline}. We will
never know whether speed limits are justified unless some people violate
them; [[we **can never know** whether]{.mark} certain
[restrictions]{.mark}]{.underline} on movement [[promote]{.mark} the
public [interest if]{.mark} such restrictions are **[enforced
perfectly]{.mark}** by using technological innovations]{.underline}. In
other words, [automated processes]{.underline} do not only erode
individual moral sensibilities; they also [**erode** public moral
deliberation]{.underline}.

#### Decisional privacy infringements reduce societal [cognitive functioning]{.underline} through [gray matter recession]{.underline} and [frontal lobe atrophy]{.underline}. 

**Day and Stemler, 20**---Assistant Professor, University of Georgia,
Terry College of Business AND Assistant Professor, Indiana University,
Kelley School of Business (Gregory and Abbey, "Are Dark Patterns
Anticompetitive?," Alabama Law Review 72, no. 1 (2020): 1-46, dml)

Applying Solove\'s framework, first, [platforms can collect a
**virtually unlimited** amount of data]{.underline} through the
Attention Cycle.1 23 Second, [platforms can **inadvertently
disseminate** data via porous security or **intentionally transfer**
data through direct and indirect sales]{.underline}.1 24 Third,
[platforms can **capitalize** on inferences drawn from data by profiling
users]{.underline}. Consider Uber, which has developed technology to
identify when a user is intoxicated (is she holding her smartphone at an
odd angle or walking in a staggered manner?). 125 Also, Tinder tracks
interactions to calculate a \"secret internal Tinder rating\" for each
user to match potential paramours, 126 and Airbnb has innovated
algorithms to calculate a user\'s \"trustworthiness score\"-predicting
\"narcissism, Machiavellianism, or psychopathy\"-drawn from the
surveillance of one\'s social media, public records, blog posts,
presence of false profiles, and other sources. 127

But [the **greatest harm** may]{.underline}, fourth, [derive from the
**privacy costs** associated with influence]{.underline}, or decisional
privacy. [[Decisional privacy **erodes** when manipulation
**invades**]{.mark} **internal [thought]{.mark}
processes**]{.underline}, 128 **[[reduces]{.mark} [free
will]{.mark}]{.underline}**,1 29 [[or **interferes** with]{.mark} a
user\'s **[self-interest]{.mark}**]{.underline}.130 [For **autonomy** to
be **possible**]{.underline}, [users must enjoy reasonable means to
**select among options** to achieve their goals]{.underline}. 131 [If
persons are **free** of manipulation]{.underline}, [they can **roughly
account** for the reasons underlying their choices]{.underline}. 132

The **[Cambridge Analytica]{.underline}** scandal of 2018 [is a **prime
example** of eroded decisional privacy]{.underline}. Investigations by
the New York Times, The Observer of London, and The Guardian revealed
that Facebook allowed Professor Aleksandr Kogan to access and sell the
personal data of over 50 million Americans. 133 The data\'s purchaser,
Cambridge Analytica, used it to influence political opinions while
\"\'circumvent\[ing\] users\' awareness of such influence.\" 134 These
[tactics included **psychological [profiles]{.mark}** meant to [identify
individuals]{.mark} who are **[prone to]{.mark} persuasion** via
[misinfo]{.mark}rmation and suggestion to take certain political
actions]{.underline}. 135 As stated by Cambridge Analytica\'s
co-founder: \"We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people\'s
profiles \[and\] built models to exploit what we knew about them and
target their inner demons.\" 136 The FTC, implying the importance of
decisional privacy, noted that remedial action was necessary given how
\"Facebook undermined consumers\' choices.\"137

B. The Individual and Societal Costs of Online Manipulation

[When interfaces and platforms **impair decisional
privacy**]{.underline}, [the [injuries can be
**substantial**]{.mark}]{.underline}. On one level, the Attention Cycle
itself can invade decisional privacy. In fact, on occasion, recognized
disorders, like internet and gaming
**[[addictions]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [can
[develop]{.mark}]{.underline}, [animated by traditional symptoms of
**dependency**]{.underline}, such as excessive use, withdrawal, and
tolerance. 138

[[Research]{.underline}]{.mark} on this topic [has even [found
**physiological**]{.mark} **[changes of the
brain]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Using structural Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (sMRI), [heightened levels of internet usage and gaming have
been shown to [cause **gray matter recession**]{.mark}]{.underline}. 139
[Gray matter]{.underline} of the brain\'s surface [controls the
**processing of information**]{.underline}, such as speech, emotion, and
motor control. 14 Tissue erosion was most pronounced-waning between 100
/-2 0 /\--in users suffering from the greatest addictions. 141
Importantly, [the shrinking of gray matter]{.underline} in the left
posterior limb [is associated with **impaired
self-control**]{.underline}, which strengthens digital addiction. 142
[Another area of **[atrophy]{.mark}** was found [in the **frontal
lobe**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [which governs **planning** and
**organizational skills**]{.underline}. 143 One study of WeChat users
deduced that [reduction of gray matter leads users to experience
**enhanced reward sensitivity** as well as **impulsivity**]{.underline},
suggesting that digital addiction begets more addiction.144

[This]{.underline} type of dependency [can even lead to alterations in
the brain resembling **prolonged narcotics abuse**]{.underline}.1 45 One
study, published in 2020, found that collegiate internet gamers who
forewent gaming displayed withdrawal symptoms mirroring that of cocaine
users.1 46 [This creates particular concern when accounting for the rate
of affected **adolescents**]{.underline} whose brains are still in the
midst of developing.1 47

[Internet addiction may also **alter dopamine receptors**]{.underline}.
Scholarship has found that dopamine released during online activities
diminishes the availability of D2 receptors.148 Lengthier addictions
display greater changes.1 49 And like with the research on gray matter,
[the effects of prolonged exposure mirror **narcotics
usage**]{.underline}. 150 Specifically, \"a decrease in the number and
function of D2 receptors, observed both in animals and in humans \... is
functionally correlated to the enhancement in drug craving, drug intake
and relapse.\" 151 Bolstering these findings, scholarship asserts that
internet addiction is the cause of receptor damage rather than vice
versa, 152 as increased exposure leads to increased damage.1 53
According to research published in the last year, debate exists about
this topic, yet the majority of scholarship and the DSM-5 agree that
online addiction entails a form of disorder. 154

In important part, [the **[physiological effects]{.mark}**]{.underline}
of internet addiction are also shown to [[cause]{.mark} an **array of

of the primary findings links the Attention Cycle to heightened anxiety.
Cortisol is a hormone that regulates the body\'s \"alarm system\" (i.e.,
the anxiety associated with fight or flight).1 55 [When individuals
**separate** from their devices]{.underline}, [the body releases
**cortisol**]{.underline}, [generating **survival reflexes** and
**anxiety**]{.underline}.156 [Other [problems]{.mark}]{.underline}

Even though internet addiction may occur without manipulation,

#### Cognitive collapse causes extinction.

Cognitive Depression,"

dml)

[Our **ability to think** and **make smart decisions is eroding** just
as [our environment]{.mark} gets **more complex** and **[harder to
grasp]{.mark}** with our traditional tools]{.underline}.

Stone age tools for cognitive age challenges?

But wait, [this is **not the first time** we face a rise in complexity
and have to contend with multiple disruptions. We've **faced tough
challenges before** and built structures to allow us to **manage** and
**make decisions at vast scales**]{.underline}. Corporations, cities,
markets, and governments are all technologies we've devised to manage
complexity and make rational and actionable decisions in a hostile
world. Steven Johnson---in his new book Farsighted---points out that
[we've **evolved decision** and **scenario sciences** to cope with
increasingly complex issues]{.underline}---from the era of Darwin when
he used the simple "pro/con" list to decide if he should get married (a
non-trivial decision) to today's advanced scenario-planning war games,
science fiction foresight tools and other scalable management
techniques.

[This time, however, **seems different**]{.underline}---for a troubling
simple reason. This time [we face the rise of **powerful new forces**
that undermine our **very ability to react** to these challenges and
disruptions: **our cognition itself is under attack**. These toxic new
forces leverage digital technology to exploit our behavioral biases,
pushed by **powerful financial incentives**]{.underline}.

The early warning signs

[What if the structures we had built to protect us against irrational
decisions turn out to be **rickety breakwaters** laid down on the shore
of a once placid sea]{.underline} and provide no protection from a
100-year flood? [When the art and science of decisions-making itself
collapses might we face a **Great Cognitive Depression**?]{.underline}

[The early warning signs are **troubling to say the least**.
**Authoritarian governments** and **despots** are enjoying a resurgence.
In many democracies, voters faced with complex issues **turn to simple
answers** and **slogans**, to the **siren call of populism**. They
**dismiss the experts**]{.underline} (think of Brexit as a case in
point), [they look for **scapegoats** and **easy fixes**.]{.underline}

[Could these be examples of human cognition **[reverting to evolutionary
shortcuts]{.mark}** to cope with complex threats? **[Authority
bias]{.mark}** is a quick way for us to decide things when we are faced
with tough choices. If something is too ambiguous or non-deterministic
we **follow the authority figure** [with the most compelling]{.mark} and
simple [story, instead of]{.mark} doing the [thinking]{.mark} for
ourselves.]{.underline}

Social scientists have documented upwards of 200+ cognitive short cuts
and biases that evolved to help us cope with danger, make decisions
fast, and conserve our precious cognitive resources to fight another
day. But sometimes those shortcuts have lived on far past their "sell
by" date. [Sometimes our brains **lie to us**. Buying behavior in
our]{.underline} simian [ancestors **seem oddly similar** to the ways
humans **make choices in markets**. [We **believe we are
rational**]{.mark} **actors** but time and again we find out that [it is
**very hard to see** the thinking]{.mark} about our thinking. And now
[it's **getting harder**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

[Here is where we find a **dangerous market failure**.]{.underline}

[A **powerful combination** of [new tech]{.mark}nologies and financial
incentives [is]{.mark} **fast [overwhelming]{.mark}** [our]{.mark} old
[protective barriers.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Digital innovations are creating value. But this value is **not given
away for free**]{.underline}, as some economists contend. There is no
free lunch.

We all know that [digital [platforms are **after our
data**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Sometimes they use it to our advantage,
with more personalized offerings; often they sell it to advertisers.
[For them]{.underline} we are a different kind of "prosumer": not a
producer-consumer, but rather a product-consumer. [We are **more a
commodity** than a true customer]{.underline}. You might argue that
well, almost everyone realizes this, and we still enter these
transactions of our own free will, so what's the problem?

But [digital platforms are not **just** after our data---they crave our
**unwavering attention**. Higher ratings command **higher advertising
rates**---and the ratings are determined by how much time we spend with
our eyeballs **glued to the screen**]{.underline}, our attention
absorbed by the apps.

Therefore, [[these]{.mark} platforms [have]{.mark} a financial
[incentive to **hold our attention**]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} to **[grab it
back]{.mark}** whenever it drifts away---a **powerful financial
incentive**]{.underline}. Hence the game of incessant notifications, of
addictive updates on likes and shares, of instigations to chase
followers, friends and connections.

See, the fact that digital platforms grab our data in exchange for their
"free" services strikes us as a lesser distortion. The digital platform,
be it Google, Amazon, Twitter or Facebook, most likely gets more value
from my individual data than it gives back to me in services. But the
truth is, my data is much less valuable to me than it is to them,
because they can aggregate it with others', whereas I cannot. And unless
I find a way to get together with millions of other users, in a sort of
modern trade union of the digital sheep, I will never have enough
bargaining power to extract more of that value. Because as long as
everybody else gives their data away, the marginal value of my data is
close to zero. But as I said, my data is of little value to me, in
isolation. Little ventured, little lost in this case.

Cognition is another matter.

[Our attention, our cognition, is a **very precious resource**. We need
it]{.underline} to study, to work, [to **run our daily
lives**]{.underline}, to take small and big and life-changing decisions.
[And it's a **limited resource**. We can fool ourselves that we can
multitask]{.underline}. That we have become a lot more productive as we
track our Twitter feed and social media messages while we work, answer
emails during conference calls.

Except that we can't and we don't. [[We become **less
productive**]{.mark}, **not more**. The **statistics**]{.underline}---as
we discussed earlier---**[bear this out]{.underline}**. It should be no
surprise. [In this more complex world, we have a lot to study and
understand---and we **cannot do it in 20-seconds bursts**]{.underline}.
When we get distracted, we need over 20 minutes to refocus on the task
at hand. [In this more complex and high-tech world, knowledge and
understanding have **enormous value**]{.underline}. The time and
cognition we invest in acquiring knowledge, mastering skills, earning
credentials, yields a very high rate of return in terms of career
opportunities, earnings, and personal fulfillment.

Which means that the opportunity cost of every minute we spend looking
at a digital ad, "catching up" on various messaging platforms, or
watching a viral video is extremely high.

And [the [digital drugs]{.mark} we take on a daily basis not only absorb
precious time today---they also **[erode our ability to
concentrate]{.mark}**]{.underline}. By pushing us to an
obsessive-compulsive habit of constantly checking for something new
online, [[they]{.mark} **gradually [destroy our]{.mark} slow-[thinking
ability]{.mark}**]{.underline} (àla Kahneman), [our **power of
concentration**. Our attention spans are **shortening**, **undermining
our future productivity** as well.]{.underline}

[This [could]{.mark} easily [become a **vicious spiral**]{.mark}:
**powerful financial incentives** will keep pushing digital platforms to
grab **more** and **more** of our attention. And **as the Internet of
Things becomes more pervasive**, they will have **more** and **more
tools** at their disposal]{.underline}: soon the mirror in your bathroom
and smart dust around you as you walk down the street will also compete
for your attention. At the same time, [these companies' tactics exploit
**deep-rooted cognitive biases**: we are programmed to pay attention to
anything referring to us, to look for news and new things, and to crave
the approval of our community. Left to itself, [this is]{.mark} **only
[going to get worse]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

So [just as we enter the **most harrowing straits for ourselves** and
**our planet**, as we race to **rebalance ever widening gaps** between
the powerful and the powerless; as we come to grips with **[extinction
level threats]{.mark}** to our way of lives, the structures we've
erected to make [rational decisions are **collapsing**]{.mark}. While we
have new decision-making and scenario planning methodologies at our
disposal, we **may not have much actual brainpower to notice**, **care**
or **bring our best thinking to the table**. The Great Cognitive
Depression is **racing towards us** and we **don't appear to be taking
the early warning signs seriously** and **may not even notice before
it's too late**. The counterfeit attention-based currency that is
flooding our markets may soon **bankrupt our cognitive
reserves**]{.underline}. Bad money (attention) drives out good, as
Gresham's Law predicts.

We've fostered the rise of industries that are rewarded for de-cognition
attacks and we have put no incentives or taxes in place to do what
markets can't or won't do themselves. [It is as if our human odyssey has
been **blown off course**, pushed by the rising tide toward the **land
of the sirens**, seduced by deceptive songs]{.underline}, hypnotized and
driven towards madness. [If we do nothing we may ultimately **wash up on
the shores from a watery grave**.]{.underline}

**[Other]{.underline}** [global risks]{.underline} could [appear if
superintelligent AI]{.underline} **[does not emerge]{.underline}** in
time [to prevent them]{.underline} (Bostrom 2003a). Superintelligent

Nick Bostrom describes three ways [[a]{.underline}]{.mark}
superintelligent [[AI system could function]{.underline}]{.mark}:6 [[As
an oracle, which **answers nearly any question posed to it with
accuracy**]{.mark}**, including complex questions that [humans
cannot]{.mark} easily answer**]{.underline}---i.e. How can I manufacture
a more efficient car engine? Google is a primitive type of oracle. As a
genie, which executes any high-level command it's given---Use a
molecular assembler to build a new and more efficient kind of car
engine---and then awaits its next command. As a sovereign, which is
assigned a broad and open-ended pursuit and allowed to operate in the
world freely, making its own decisions about how best to
proceed---Invent a faster, cheaper, and safer way than cars for humans
to privately transport themselves. [[These questions and tasks,]{.mark}
which seem complicated to us, [would sound to a superintelligent system
like]{.mark} someone [asking you]{.mark} to improve upon the "[My pencil
fell off the table]{.mark}"]{.underline} situation, [which you'd do by
picking it up and putting it back on the table.]{.underline} Eliezer
Yudkowsky, a resident of Anxious Avenue in our chart above, said it
well: [There are no hard problems, only problems that are hard to a
certain level of intelligence.]{.underline} Move the smallest bit
upwards \[in level of intelligence\], and some problems will suddenly
move from "impossible" to "obvious." Move a substantial degree upwards,
and all of them will become obvious.7 [There are a lot of eager
scientists, inventors, and entrepreneurs]{.underline} in Confident
Corner[---but for a tour of the brightest side of the AI horizon,
there's only one person we want as our tour guide.]{.underline} Ray
Kurzweil is polarizing. In my reading, I heard everything from godlike
worship of him and his ideas to eye-rolling contempt for them. Others
were somewhere in the middle---author Douglas Hofstadter, in discussing
the ideas in Kurzweil's books, eloquently put forth that "it is as if
you took a lot of very good food and some dog excrement and blended it
all up so that you can't possibly figure out what's good or bad."8
Whether you like his ideas or not, [everyone agrees that
[Kurzweil]{.mark} is impressive]{.underline}. He began inventing things
as a teenager and in the following decades, he came up with several
breakthrough inventions, including the first flatbed scanner, the first
scanner that converted text to speech (allowing the blind to read
standard texts), the well-known Kurzweil music synthesizer (the first
true electric piano), and the first commercially marketed
large-vocabulary speech recognition[. He's the author of five national
bestselling books. He's [well-known for his bold predictions and has
a]{.mark}]{.underline} pretty [[good record of having them come
true]{.mark}---including his prediction in the late '80s, a time when
the internet was an obscure thing, that by the early 2000s, it would
become a global phenomenon. Kurzweil has been called a "**restless
genius"**]{.underline} by The Wall Street Journal, "[the ultimate
thinking machine]{.underline}" by Forbes, "Edison's rightful heir" by
Inc. Magazine, and **["the best person I know at predicting the future
of artificial intelligence" by Bill Gates]{.underline}**.9 In 2012,
[Google]{.underline} co-founder Larry Page approached Kurzweil and
[asked him to be **Google's Director of Engineering**]{.underline}.5 In
2011, [he **co-founded Singularity University**, which is hosted by NASA
and sponsored partially by Google. Not bad for one life.]{.underline}
This biography is important. When Kurzweil articulates his vision of the
future, he sounds fully like a crackpot, and the crazy thing is that
he's not---he's an extremely smart, knowledgeable, relevant man in the
world. You may think he's wrong about the future, but he's not a fool.
Knowing he's such a legit dude makes me happy, because as I've learned
about his predictions for the future, I badly want him to be right. And
you do too. As you hear Kurzweil's predictions, many shared by other
Confident Corner thinkers like Peter Diamandis and Ben Goertzel, it's
not hard to see why he has such a large, passionate following---known as
the singularitarians. Here's what he thinks is going to happen:
[Timeline [Kurzweil believes computers will reach **AGI by
2029**]{.mark} and that by 2045, we'll have]{.underline} not only
[ASI]{.underline}, but a full-blown new world---a time he calls the
singularity. [[His AI-related timeline used to be seen as]{.mark}
outrageously [overzealous]{.mark}]{.underline}, and it still is by
many,6 [[but in the last 15 years]{.mark}, the [rapid advances]{.mark}
of ANI systems have [brought the larger world of AI experts]{.mark} much
**[closer to Kurzweil's timeline]{.mark}**]{.underline}. His predictions
are still a bit more ambitious than the [[median respondent]{.mark} on
Müller and Bostrom's survey (AGI by [2040]{.mark}, ASI by
2060]{.underline}), but not by that much. Kurzweil's depiction of the
2045 singularity is brought about by three simultaneous revolutions in
biotechnology, nanotechnology, and, most powerfully, AI. What AI Could
Do For Us Armed with superintelligence and all the technology
superintelligence would know how to create, ASI would likely be able to
[[solve]{.mark} every problem in humanity. [Global
warming]{.mark}]{.underline}? ASI could first halt CO2 emissions by
coming up with much better ways to generate energy that had nothing to
do with fossil fuels. Then it could create some innovative way to begin
to remove excess CO2 from the atmosphere. [Cancer and other
[diseases]{.mark}]{.underline}? No problem for ASI---health and medicine
would be revolutionized beyond imagination. [[World
hunger]{.underline}]{.mark}? ASI could use things like nanotech to build
meat from scratch that would be molecularly identical to real meat---in
other words, it would be real meat. Nanotech could turn a pile of
garbage into a huge vat of fresh meat or other food (which wouldn't have
to have its normal shape---picture a giant cube of apple)---and
distribute all this food around the world using ultra-advanced
transportation. Of course, this would also be great for animals, who
wouldn't have to get killed by humans much anymore, and ASI could do
lots of other things to save endangered species or even bring back
extinct species through work with preserved DNA. ASI could even [solve
our most complex macro]{.underline} issues---our [debates over how
[economies]{.mark} should be run and how world trade is best
facilitated]{.underline}, even our haziest grapplings in philosophy or
ethics---would all be painfully obvious to ASI.

#### There's no risk of errors\-\--even if AI isn't perfect, it's great at admitting what it doesn't know\-\--human error is orders of magnitude worse

Patrick **Tucker 20** {Patrick Tucker is technology editor for Defense
One. 4-29-2020. "Artificial Intelligence Outperforms Human Intel
Analysts In a Key Area."

[In the 1983 movie WarGames]{.underline}, the world is brought to the
edge of nuclear destruction when a military computer using artificial
intelligence interprets false data as an imminent Soviet missile strike.
Its [human overseers in the Defense Department, unsure whether the data
is real, can't convince the AI that it may be wrong]{.underline}. A
**[recent]{.underline}** finding from the Defense Intelligence Agency,
or DIA, [suggests]{.underline} that in a real situation where humans and
AI were looking at enemy activity, [**those positions would be
reversed.** [Artificial intelligence]{.mark} can [actually]{.mark} be
**[more cautious]{.mark}**]{.underline} than humans about its
conclusions [[in situations when data is limited]{.underline}]{.mark}.
While the results are preliminary, they offer an important glimpse into
how [[humans and AI]{.underline}]{.mark} will [[complement one
another]{.mark} in critical national security fields]{.underline}. DIA
analyzes activity from militaries around the globe. Terry Busch, the
technical director for the agency's Machine-Assisted Analytic
Rapid-Repository System, or MARS, on Monday joined a Defense One
viewcast to discuss the agency's efforts to incorporate AI into analysis
and decision-making. Earlier this year, Busch\'s team set up a test
between a human and AI. The first part was simple enough: use available
data to determine whether a particular ship was in U.S. waters. "Four
analysts came up with four methodologies; and the machine came up with
two different methodologies and that was cool. They all agreed that this
particular ship was in the United States," he said. So far, so good.
Humans and machines using available data can reach similar conclusions.
The second phase of the experiment tested something different:
conviction. Would humans and machines be equally certain in their
conclusions if less data were available? The experimenters severed the
connection to the Automatic Identification System, or AIS, which tracks
ships worldwide. "It's pretty easy to find something if you have the AIS
feed, because that's going to tell you exactly where a ship is located
in the world. If we took that away, how does that change confidence and
do the machine and the humans get to the same end state?" [In theory,
[with less data]{.mark}, the [human analyst should be less certain in
their conclusions]{.mark}]{.underline}, like the characters in WarGames.
After all, humans understand nuance and can conceptualize a wide variety
of outcomes. [The researchers found the]{.underline}
[opposite]{.underline}. "Once we began to take away sources, everyone
was left with the same source material --- which was numerous reports,
generally social media, open source kinds of things, or references to
the ship being in the United States --- so everyone had access to the
same data. The difference was that the [machine, and those responsible
for doing the [machine learning, **took far less
risk**]{.mark}]{.underline} --- in confidence --- [[than the humans
did]{.underline}]{.mark}," he said. "The [machine]{.underline} [actually
does a **[better job of lowering its confidence than the humans
do]{.mark}**]{.underline}....There's a little bit of humor in that
because the machine still thinks they're pretty right." The experiment
provides a snapshot of how humans and AI will team for important
analytical tasks. But it also reveals how human judgement has limits
when pride is involved. [[Humans, particularly
experts]{.underline}]{.mark} in specific fields, [have a [tendency to
overestimate their ability]{.mark} to correctly infer
outcomes]{.underline} when given limited data. Nobel-prize winning
economist and psychologist Daniel Kahneman has written on the subject
extensively. Kahneman describes this tendency as the "inside view." He
cites the experience of a group of Israeli educators assigned to write a
new textbook for the Ministry of Education. They anticipated that it
would take them a fraction of the amount of time they knew it would take
another similar team. They couldn't explain why they were overconfident;
they just were. [Overconfidence is human and a particular trait among
highly functioning expert humans, one that machines don't necessarily
share.]{.underline}

#### The utilitarianism constraint guarentees the AI makes decisions optimal under human morality

4.3.1. The third objection -- morality

Computers should not make decisions that affect people\'s lives and
wellbeing

Some people believe that [[we can train a machine to become
moral]{.underline}]{.mark}, e.g. by [having a lot of people answer
various questions on the morally superior decision]{.underline} in
various instances of the trolley problem. The Moral Machine is one such
endeavour that has attracted much attention \[54\]. It is an attempt to
[[crowd-source the morality of people]{.mark} around the world in order
to [teach a computer to distinguish right from
wrong]{.mark}]{.underline}, in order to find ethical principles to guide
machine behaviour. This is an approach which could be related to the
approach of WeBuildAI, in which [[social choice theory and popular
participation]{.mark} is used to [train algorithms]{.mark}]{.underline}
\[39\].

Kurzweil \[29\] predicts that machines will gain human proficiencies and
capabilities, including morality-related emotions. Maldonato and Valerio
\[55\] and Scheutz \[56\] also discuss related topics, e.g. machines
with value systems and the creation of machines with moral competences.
[**[Even if they do not gain]{.mark}** anything akin to [**human
morality**, machines are]{.mark} becoming **[better at understanding
human morality]{.mark}**, as it [can **quantify, track and compare moral
bias**,]{.mark} for example, '**[across cultures and over
time']{.mark}**]{.underline} \[57\].

However, we could also approach this objection more pragmatically. [If
we decide that decisions that affect people\'s wellbeing require moral
capabilities, we are already employing AI in situations where it does
not belong. Self-driving cars]{.underline} could not then be allowed.
[Robots trading in markets]{.underline} would become highly problematic.
Use of AI to determine whether or not criminal offenders should receive
bail would be highly dubious.

[AI is already involved in moral decisions in countless
ways]{.underline}, and our current approach to this issue is to make
someone other than the computer itself morally responsible for the
decisions made. We will include the premise in the tentative discussion,
but I will argue in the conclusion that this objection is better
understood by way of handling objection 5 and the attribution of AI
decisions.

Another obvious counterobjection would be that **[[if machines cannot be
moral, neither can they be immoral]{.underline}]{.mark}**. To some
people this situation would appear to be a [hug[e advantage compared
with]{.mark} the capacities of [today\'s politicians. If]{.mark} indeed
[power corrupts]{.mark}, we should see it as [an advantage that AI has
no morally corruptible nature]{.mark}]{.underline} \[58\].

### AT: AI Governance Fails

#### Near term artificial intelligence will massively outperform humans in political predictions\-\--we should give them control over our governmental decisions

The title of [this article promises a]{.underline} shallow [defence of a
technocracy of AI.]{.underline} This refers to the argument I will
construct in the first part of the article, which consists of three
proposition that [lead to the conclusion that **[we should]{.mark}**
employ AI in politics, and **[erect a technocracy of
AI]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This argument will then be subjected to a set
of objections to such a technocracy in section 4. The first two
components of the shallow defence follow form the preceding
consideration on technocracy and politics.

First of all, [[politics]{.mark} can be [understood as a process]{.mark}
aimed at [implementing the best possible policies]{.mark}.]{.underline}
But [what policy is]{.underline} considered [best can]{.underline}, of
course, [only be decided once we know what criteria to
apply]{.underline}. Thus, the first and fundamental purpose of politics
is to develop and elucidate what fundamental moral values a society is
based on. Only then can politics as we know it in the day-to-day
workings of society take place. And only then can we properly assess the
value of technology \[19\]. This is the first building block in the
defence of an AI technocracy:

[[Policies]{.mark} should be [evaluated on the basis of the]{.mark}
fundamental [moral values of the society]{.mark} in
question]{.underline}, and finding these values is the first purpose of
politics.

Furthermore, if politics revolves around the question of finding the
best policies, as Schumpeter \[6\] implies, we also have a second
premise in the establishment of what will become the defence:

The best policies in accordance with the evaluation discussed in the
first premise should be implemented.

3\. Artificial intelligence and political decision-making

[[A]{.mark}rtificial [i]{.mark}ntelligence [is superior to human
intelligence for analysis of]{.mark} large and [complex problems
**involving**]{.mark} the need for **[strategy, prediction of long-term
effects and]{.mark}** analysis of **vast** amounts of
**[data]{.mark}**]{.underline}[. [One example is]{.underline}]{.mark}
[playing [chess and Go]{.mark}]{.underline} \[\[26\], \[27\], \[28\],
\[29\]\]. However, [[**AI can beat humans at more than fun and games.**
Politics is complex]{.mark}, and it [involves many considerations
of]{.mark}]{.underline} notoriously uncertain [[short- and long-term
consequences]{.underline}]{.mark}. As the literature on algorithmic
governance shows[, [AI]{.mark} is [already employed in many]{.mark}
facets of government]{.underline}, as I show in section 3.1.

I will note at the outset that the potential benefits from AI in
politics is heavily contested \[4\]. I agree with the idea that AI as of
today is not some silver bullet that can be employed in order to create
flourishing societies. However, as the many existing applications
clearly show, there is undeniably a potential for the beneficial use of
AI in politics. I will assume that some of this potential can be
realised, and that we will continue to see certain improvements in the
technologies involved. This means that [[I consider possible near-future
technologies, and not speculative developments related to]{.mark} some
form of [singularity, etc]{.mark}.]{.underline} \[29\].

I will not discuss the technologies involved in great detail, but rely
on the assumption that much of the future applications of AI is based on
the technologies currently employed. de Sousa et al. \[5\] chart the
technologies most often employed in public sector AI; various forms of
machine learning are used, while [[artificial neural
networks]{.underline}]{.mark} (ANN) is the [most popular
technique]{.underline} in terms of usage. Artificial neural networks
(ANNs) [[imitate biological information-processing systems]{.mark}, and
consist of artificial neurons that transmit signals to each other in
reinforcement systems]{.underline}, for example \[30\]. Deep learning is
our term for deeply layered neural networks, and this is the machine
learning approach used by the AI economist I use as an example, as well
as by Google\'s AlphaGo and AlphaZero \[31,28,32,1\].

"Superintelligence FAQ."
https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/LTtNXM9shNM9AC2mp/superintelligence-faq#2_1\_\_What_do_you_mean_by\_\_fast_takeoff\_\_}//JM

2.1: What do you mean by "fast takeoff"?

[A [slow takeoff is a situation in which]{.mark}]{.underline} AI goes
from infrahuman to human to superhuman intelligence very gradually. For
example, imagine an augmented "IQ" scale (THIS IS NOT HOW IQ ACTUALLY
WORKS -- JUST AN EXAMPLE) where rats weigh in at 10, chimps at 30, the
village idiot at 60, average humans at 100, and Einstein at 200. And
suppose that as technology advances, computers gain two points on this
scale per year. So if they start out as smart as rats in 2020, they'll
be as smart as chimps in 2035, as smart as the village idiot in 2050, as
smart as average humans in 2070, and as smart as Einstein in 2120. By
2190, they'll be IQ 340, as far beyond Einstein as Einstein is beyond a
village idiot.

In this scenario progress is gradual and manageable. By 2050, we will
have long since noticed the trend and predicted we have 20 years until
average-human-level intelligence. Once AIs reach average-human-level
intelligence, we will have fifty years during which some of us are still
smarter than they are, years in which we can work with them as equals,
test and retest their programming, and build institutions that promote
cooperation. Even though the [[AIs of 2190]{.mark} may [qualify as
"superintelligent]{.mark}",]{.underline} it will have been long-expected
and there would be little point in planning now when the people of 2070
will have so many more resources to plan with.

[A [**moderate takeoff** is a situation in which AI]{.mark}]{.underline}
goes from infrahuman to human to superhuman relatively quickly. For
example, imagine that in 2020 AIs are much like those of today -- good
at a few simple games, but without clear domain-general intelligence or
"common sense". From 2020 to 2050, AIs demonstrate some academically
interesting gains on specific problems, and become better at tasks like
machine translation and self-driving cars, and by 2047 there are some
that seem to display some vaguely human-like abilities at the level of a
young child. By late 2065, they are still less intelligent than a smart
human adult. **[[By 2066]{.underline}]{.mark}**, they [are **[far
smarter than Einstein]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

A [[fast takeoff scenario]{.underline}]{.mark} is one in which computers
[[go even faster]{.underline}]{.mark} than this, perhaps moving from
infrahuman to human to superhuman in only days or weeks.

[2.1.1: [Why might we expect a moderate takeoff?]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[Because this is the history of computer]{.mark}]{.underline} Go, with
fifty years added on to each date. [In 1997, the best computer Go
program in the world,]{.underline} Handtalk, [won]{.underline}
NT\$250,000 [for performing a previously impossible feat -- beating an
11 year old child]{.underline} (with an 11-stone handicap penalizing the
child and favoring the computer!) [As late as September 2015, no
computer had ever beaten any professional Go player in a fair
game.]{.underline} [Then in March 2016, a Go program beat 18-time world
champion Lee Sedol]{.underline} 4-1 in a five game match[. [Go programs
had gone from "**dumber than children**" to "**smarter than any human
in**]{.mark} **the world" in [eighteen years,]{.mark}** [and "from
**never won a professional game**" to "**overwhelming world champion" in
six months**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}

The [[slow takeoff scenario]{.mark} mentioned above]{.underline} is
loading the dice. It theorizes a timeline where computers took fifteen
years to go from "rat" to "chimp", but also took thirty-five years to go
from "chimp" to "average human" and fifty years to go from "average
human" to "Einstein". But [[from an evolutionary
perspective]{.underline}]{.mark} this [[is ridiculous]{.mark}. It [took
about fifty million years]{.mark}]{.underline} (and major redesigns in
several brain structures[!) [to go from]{.mark} the [first rat-like
creatures to chimps. But]{.mark}]{.underline} it
[[only]{.underline}]{.mark} took about [[five]{.mark} million
years]{.underline} (and very minor changes in brain structure) [[to go
from chimps to humans]{.mark}. And]{.underline} going [from the [average
human to Einstein didn't even require evolutionary
work]{.mark}]{.underline} -- it's [just]{.underline} the result of
[random variation]{.underline} in the existing structures!

So maybe our hypothetical IQ scale above is off. If we took an
evolutionary and neuroscientific perspective, it would look more like
flatworms at 10, rats at 30, chimps at 60, the village idiot at 90, the
average human at 98, and Einstein at 100.

Suppose that we start out, again, with computers as smart as rats in
2020. Now we get still get computers as smart as chimps in 2035. And we
still get computers as smart as the village idiot in 2050. But now we
get computers as smart as the average human in 2054, and computers as
smart as Einstein in 2055. By 2060, we're getting the superintelligences
as far beyond Einstein as Einstein is beyond a village idio

[This [offers a **much shorter time window**]{.mark} **to react to AI
developments**]{.underline}. In the slow takeoff scenario, we figured we
could wait until computers were as smart as humans before we had to
start thinking about this; after all, that still gave us fifty years
before computers were even as smart as Einstein. But in the moderate
takeoff scenario, it gives us one year until Einstein and six years
until superintelligence. That's starting to look like not enough time to
be entirely sure we know what we're doing.

[2.1.2: [Why might we expect a fast takeoff?]{.mark}]{.underline}

AlphaGo used about 0.5 petaflops (= trillion floating point operations
per second) in its championship game. But the world's fastest
supercomputer, TaihuLight, can calculate at almost 100 petaflops. So
suppose Google developed a human-level AI on a computer system similar
to AlphaGo, caught the attention of the Chinese government (who run
TaihuLight), and they transfer the program to their much more powerful
computer. What would happen?

It [depends on to what degree intelligence benefits from more
computational resources]{.underline}. This differs for different
processes. [For domain-general intelligence, it seems to benefit quite a
bit -- both across species and across human individuals, bigger brain
size correlates with greater intelligence]{.underline}. This matches the
evolutionarily rapid growth in intelligence from chimps to hominids to
modern man; the few hundred thousand years since australopithecines
weren't enough time to develop complicated new algorithms, and evolution
seems to have just given humans bigger brains and packed more neurons
and glia in per square inch. It's not really clear why the process
stopped (if it ever did), but it might have to do with heads getting too
big to fit through the birth canal. Cancer risk might also have been
involved -- scientists have found that smarter people are more likely to
get brain cancer, possibly because they're already overclocking their
ability to grow brain cells.

At least in neuroscience, once evolution "discovered" certain key
insights, further increasing intelligence seems to have been a matter of
providing it with more computing power. So again -- what happens when we
transfer the hypothetical human-level AI from AlphaGo to a
TaihuLight-style supercomputer two hundred times more powerful? It might
be a stretch to expect it to go from IQ 100 to IQ 20,000, but might it
increase to an Einstein-level 200, or a superintelligent 300? Hard to
say -- but if Google ever does develop a human-level AI, the Chinese
government will probably be interested in finding out.

Even if its intelligence doesn't scale linearly, TaihuLight could give
it more time. TaihuLight is two hundred times faster than AlphaGo.
Transfer an AI from one to the other, and even if its intelligence
didn't change -- [even if it had exactly the same thoughts -- it would
think them two hundred times faste]{.underline}r. An Einstein-level AI
on AlphaGo hardware might (like the historical Einstein) discover one
revolutionary breakthrough every five years. Transfer it to TaihuLight,
and it would work two hundred times faster -- a revolutionary
breakthrough every week.

[[Supercomputers track Moore's Law]{.underline}]{.mark}; the top
[[supercomputer of 2016 is a hundred times faster than the top
supercomputer of 2006]{.underline}.]{.mark} If this progress continues,
the top computer of 2026 will be a hundred times faster still. Run
Einstein on that computer, and he will come up with a revolutionary
breakthrough every few hours. Or something. At this point it becomes a
little bit hard to imagine. All I know is that it only took one
Einstein, at normal speed, to lay the theoretical foundation for nuclear
weapons. Anything a thousand times faster than that is definitely cause
for concern.

There's one final, very concerning reason to expect a fast takeoff.
Suppose, once again, we have an [[AI as smart as
Einstein]{.underline}]{.mark}. It might, like the historical Einstein,
contemplate physics. Or it might [contemplate]{.underline} an area very
relevant to its own interests: [artificial intelligence]{.underline}. In
that case, instead of making a revolutionary physics breakthrough every
few hours, it [will [make a revolutionary AI breakthrough every few
hou]{.mark}rs. Each AI breakthrough it makes, it will have the
opportunity to reprogram itself to take advantage of its discovery,
becoming more intelligent,]{.underline} thus [speeding up its
breakthroughs further.]{.underline} The cycle will stop only when it
reaches some physical limit -- some technical challenge to further
improvements that even an entity far smarter than Einstein cannot
discover a way around.

To human programmers, such a cycle would look like a "critical mass".
Before the critical level, any AI advance delivers only modest benefits.
But any tiny improvement that pushes an AI above the critical level
would result in a feedback loop of inexorable self-improvement all the
way up to some stratospheric limit of possible computing power.

This **[[feedback loop would be exponential]{.underline}]{.mark}**;
relatively slow in the beginning, but blindingly fast as it approaches
an asymptote. Consider the AI which starts off making forty
breakthroughs per year -- one every nine days. Now suppose it gains on
average a 10% speed improvement with each breakthrough. It starts on
January 1. Its first breakthrough comes January 10 or so. Its second
comes a little faster, January 18. Its third is a little faster still,
January 25. By the beginning of February, it's sped up to producing one
breakthrough every seven days, more or less. By the beginning of March,
it's making about one breakthrough every three days or so. But by March
20, it's up to one breakthrough a day. By late on the night of March 29,
it's making a breakthrough every second.

Similarly, particular kinds of policy problems pose especially serious
challenges [for prudent long-term governance]{.underline}. [[The most
difficult problems]{.underline}]{.mark} are those
[[exhibit]{.mark}ing]{.underline} one or more of the following
characteristics: [[high **complexity**; **low predictability**

**[impacts]{.mark}** that are mostly [**experienced in the future**

predominantly on politically weak or marginalized groups; and, as noted
earlier, problems which require investment-type solutions (i.e. up-front
costs are required in order to secure long-term benefits). Human-induced
[[climate change exhibits]{.mark} most, if not all, of [these]{.mark}
features]{.underline}, which helps account for the difficulty of
securing prudent policy responses. [**[But]{.underline}** [**many policy
problems** also exhibit investment-type payoff
structures]{.underline}]{.mark}[, thus [creating]{.mark} a
[**temptation** for inter-generational

### AT: AI Governance Hurts Democracy

#### People aren't politically active now, but AI government increases the political power of the population

4.1.1. The [first objection -- people\'s political nature]{.underline}
People need full political participation in order to be satisfied This
is, however, only one of the interpretations of Aristotle\'s view of
humans and politics. Mulgan \[44\] shows that Aristotle can also be
understood as supporting 'the withdrawal from politics, or at least
reluctant participation'. In both The Politics and Ethics the
philosopher\'s lifestyle is portrayed as being superior to the life of
the statesman \[44\]. Another immediate objection would be to ask:
[**[Are people politically active]{.mark}** in [today]{.mark}\'s
political systems? [What will really change if **AI**]{.mark} [makes our
decisions, **instead of bureaucrats**]{.mark}?]{.underline} The
'[political animal' [argument]{.mark}]{.underline} is [[against any move
from direct democracy towards]{.mark} democracy by
[representation]{.mark}]{.underline} or republicanism, and this move
could be said to be a necessary evil if we are to have large-scale,
complex societies. This objection also relies on an agreement with
Aristotle\'s hierarchical ordering of human activities. Other
philosophies, such as hedonism, could easily portray [a life of
[increased wealth]{.mark} and leisure [as]{.mark} a potential
[improvement to]{.mark} a life]{.underline} material hardship and
[[political activity]{.mark}.]{.underline} Philosophers such as F. A.
Hayek have proposed that involvement in politics is not that important,
and that [economic liberty is]{.underline} what is [essential to good
societies]{.underline} \[17\]. Following this argument, he states that
democracy is not necessarily the best way to rule, and that '... a
[democracy may well wield totalitarian powers]{.underline}, and it is
conceivable that an [authoritarian government may act on liberal
principles']{.underline} \[17\]. However, a crucial point of this
article is that a [[technocracy of AI may]{.mark} in fact [lead to a
revitalization of popular participation]{.mark} [and]{.mark} the
[accessibility]{.mark} of the political domain.]{.underline} Through
[[**new ways of participation**, such as **algorithmic
co-creation**]{.mark}, we [could]{.mark} find ourselves in a situation
in which most people have, and [experience, **more political
power**]{.mark} than they do today]{.underline}. This is examined in
more detail in the next objection.

### AT: AI Regulation Bad

#### This ensures bad AI.

**New and Castro, 18**---senior policy analyst at the Center for Data
Innovation AND director of the Center for Data Innovation and vice
president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation
(Joshua and Daniel, "How Policymakers Can Foster Algorithmic
Accountability,"
<https://www2.datainnovation.org/2018-algorithmic-accountability.pdf>,
dml)

Thus, [it is wise to be **skeptical** of advocates rushing to regulate
new technologies]{.underline} due to concerns about their hypothetical
harms before it is clear how market forces, technological advancement,
and existing regulations would shape their use as they mature. [However,
with algorithmic decision-making, **[dismissing]{.mark} any** and **all
[efforts]{.mark}** [to improve governance would be
**problematic**]{.mark}]{.underline}. While explicit calls for the
government to not regulate any algorithms and leave it entirely to
industry to selfregulate are few and far between, [some do
advocate]{.underline} for it. For example, technology reporter Tristan
Greene, writing for The Next Web, concluded that due to the speculative
nature of many of the fears about AI, the "government is clueless about
AI and shouldn't be allowed to regulate it."72 Mouloud Dey, director of
innovation and business solutions at SAS France, argues [that
governments **should not step in** to regulate algorithms]{.underline}
because of the burden regulations could have on innovation---and that
industry selfregulation would be adequate to address any potential
harms.73 [In many cases]{.underline} however, [more general
[anti-regulation attitudes]{.mark} could still lend credence to the
notion that the government should not regulate algorithms at all, by
**[overshadow]{.mark}ing [legitimate efforts]{.mark}** [to
regulate]{.mark} the technology [in an **evenhanded**, **beneficial
way**]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example, Simon Constable, a fellow at
the Johns Hopkins Institute for Applied Economics, Global Health, and
the Study of Business Enterprise, writing in Forbes, erroneously
concluded that due to the U.S. government's failure to prevent or
mitigate the 2008 financial crisis, "It\'s time to just say no to calls
for more government regulation of the tech industry."74

Given the steps some governments, such as the EU's GDPR, have already
taken that will clearly limit innovation, it is easy to be sympathetic
to such positions. But while [industry [self-regulation, market forces,
and tort law]{.mark}]{.underline} will likely play a large role in
positively shaping the use of algorithms, there are reasons why these
alone [[would be **insufficient** to protect against]{.mark} all
potential [harms]{.mark} of algorithmic decision-making]{.underline},
which likely fall into one of three categories. First, [there are some
potential applications]{.underline} of algorithms [where traditional
market forces that could mitigate the harms of algorithms]{.underline},
such as the threat of reputational damage if a company's algorithm
causes harm, [are **diminished**]{.underline}, making the cost of this
flawed decision-making one-sided. [This is particularly true with
**government uses** of AI]{.underline} wherein the costs of bad
decisions are indeed problematic, but not borne directly by the
government agency using the algorithm. In other words, [[even though a
discriminatory algorithm is an inferior product]{.mark}, there are some
situations where [this **would not deter** an operator]{.mark} from
deploying it]{.underline}. Second, [there are applications of
algorithmic decision-making where even though incentives to minimize
harms exist, the potential harms could be **significant enough to
warrant regulation**, such as is with autonomous vehicles]{.underline}.
And third, [[certain applications]{.mark} of algorithms [could cause
harms]{.mark}, such as exacerbating inequality, but [without]{.mark} an
operator expressly or [obviously breaking the law]{.mark}]{.underline}.
For example, an online jobs board could utilize a targeted advertising
algorithm that does not consider race but nonetheless uses variables
that inadvertently serve as proxies for race, such as zip code, thereby
favoring members of a certain race for job opportunities. [This harm
**may not be immediately obvious**]{.underline} to the public,
regulators, or even the operator. [In such cases]{.underline}, absent
public outrage, [[businesses have **reduced incentive** to
scrutinize]{.mark} their [algorithms]{.mark} thoroughly to prevent this
harm, [as there is **not a**]{.mark} **strong [profit motive]{.mark}**
to do so]{.underline}.

### AT: AI Regulations Impossible

#### Strong AI regs are enforceable \-\-- they're necessary to prevent extinction risks that far outweigh nuclear war 

**Shulman 11** \[Carl, Research Fellow at the Machine Intelligence
Research Institute, "Arms races and intelligence explosions (extended
abstract)," April, 2011,
http://singularityhypothesis.blogspot.com/2011/04/arms-races-and-intelligence-explosions.html\]

[A second critical difference between the nuclear and AI cases is in the
**expected danger of development**]{.underline}, as opposed to
deployment and use. Manhattan Project scientists did consider the
possibility that a nuclear test would unleash a self-sustaining chain
reaction in the atmosphere and destroy all human life, conducting
informal calculations at the time suggesting that this was extremely
improbable. A more formal process conducted after the tests confirmed
the earlier analysis (Konopinski, Marvin, & Teller, 1946), although it
would not have provided any protection had matters been otherwise. The
historical record thus tells us relatively little about the willingness
of military and civilian leaders to forsake or delay a decisive military
advantage to avert larger risks of global catastrophe. In contrast,
numerous scholars have argued that advanced **[[AI poses a nontrivial
risk of catastrophic outcomes, including]{.mark} humane
[extinction]{.mark}.]{.underline}** (Bostrom, 2002; Chalmers, 2010;
Friedman, 2008; Hall, 2007; Kurzweil, 2005; Moravec, 1999; Posner, 2004;
Rees, 2004; Yudkowsky, 2008). Setting aside anthropomorphic presumptions
of rebelliousness, a more rigorous argument (Omohundro, 2007) relies on
the instrumental value of such behavior for entities with a wide variety
of goals that are easier to achieve with more resources and with
adequate defense against attack. Many decision algorithms could thus
appear benevolent when in weak positions during safety testing, only to
cause great harm when in more powerful positions, e.g. after extensive
self-improvement. [[Given]{.mark} abundant time and centralized [careful
efforts to ensure safety, **it seems very probable that these risks
could be avoided**]{.mark}**: development [paths that seemed]{.mark} to
pose a [high risk]{.mark} of catastrophe [could be relinquished in favor
of safer ones]{.mark}**]{.underline}. However, the context of an arms
race might not permit such caution[. A risk of [accidental AI disaster
would threaten]{.mark} all of [humanity]{.mark}]{.underline}, while the
benefits of being first to develop AI would be concentrated, creating a
collective action problem insofar as tradeoffs between speed and safety
existed. A first-pass analysis suggests a number of such tradeoffs.
[Providing more [computing power would]{.mark} [allow AIs to]{.mark}
either operate at superhumanly fast timescales or to
[proliferate]{.mark} very numerous copies. Doing so would greatly
accelerate progress, but also render it infeasible for humans to engage
in detailed supervision of AI activities]{.underline}. To make decisions
on such timescales AI systems would require decision algorithms with
very general applicability, making it harder to predict and constrain
their behavior. Even **[obviously risky systems might be embraced for
competitive advantage]{.underline}**, and the powers with the most
optimistic estimates or cavalier attitudes regarding risk would be more
likely to take the lead. IV. Barriers to AI arms control [[Could an AI
arms race be regulated]{.underline}]{.mark} using international
agreements similar to those governing nuclear technology? In some ways,
**[[there are much stronger reasons for
agreement]{.underline}]{.mark}**: the stability of nuclear deterrence,
and the protection afforded by existing nuclear powers to their allies,
mean that the increased threat of a new nuclear power is not
overwhelming. No nuclear weapons have been detonated in anger since
1945. In contrast, simply developing [[AI]{.underline}]{.mark} capable
of producing an intelligence explosion [[puts all states at
risk]{.underline}]{.mark} from the effects of accidental catastrophe, or
the military dominance engendered by a localized intelligence explosion.
However, AI is a dual-use technology, with incremental advances in the
field offering enormous economic and humanitarian gains that far
outweigh near-term drawbacks. [Restricting these benefits to reduce the
risks of a distant, novel, and unpredictable advance would be very
politically challenging.]{.underline} Superhumanly intelligent AI
promises even greater rewards: advances in technology that could vastly
improve human health, wealth, and welfare while addressing other risks
such as climate change. Efforts to outright ban or relinquish AI
technology would seem to require strong evidence of very high near-term
risks. However, [[agreements might]{.mark} prove highly beneficial if
they could [avert an arms race and allow for]{.mark} **more
[controlled]{.mark} AI [development]{.mark}** with more rigorous safety
measures, and sharing of the benefits among all powers]{.underline}.
Such an agreement would face increased problems of verification and
enforcement. Where nuclear weapons require rare radioactive materials,
large specialized equipment, and other easily identifiable inputs, AI
research can proceed with only skilled researchers and computing
hardware. Verification of an agreement would require incredibly
intrusive monitoring of scientific personnel and computers throughout
the territory of participating states. Further, while violations of
nuclear arms control agreements can be punished after the fact, a covert
intelligence explosion could allow [[a treaty
violator]{.underline}]{.mark} to withstand later sanctions. These
additional challenges might be addressed in light of the increased
benefits of agreement, but [[might]{.underline}]{.mark} also **[[become
tractable thanks to early AI systems]{.underline}]{.mark}**. If those
systems do not themselves cause catastrophe but do provide a decisive
advantage to some powers, **[[they might be used to enforce safety
regulations thereafter, providing a chance to "go
slow"]{.mark}]{.underline}** on subsequent steps. V. Game-theoretic
model of an AI arms race In the full paper, we present a simple
game-theoretic model of a risky AI arms race. In this model, the risk of
accidental catastrophe depends on the number of competitors, the
magnitude of random noise in development times, the exchange rate
between risk and development speed, and the strength of preferences for
developing safe AI first. VI. Ethical implications and responses The
above analysis highlights [**[two important possible
consequences]{.mark}** of advanced AI: a [disruptive change in
i]{.mark}nternational power [r]{.mark}elations [and]{.mark} a risk of
inadvertent [disaster]{.mark}.]{.underline} From an ethical point of
view**[, the [accidental risk deserves]{.mark} special [attention since
it threatens]{.mark} human [extinction]{.mark}, not only killing current
people but also denying future generations existence]{.underline}**.
(Matheny, 2007; Bostrom, 2003). While AI systems would outlive humanity,
[AI systems might lack key features contributing to moral
value]{.underline}, such as individual identities, play, love, and
happiness (Bostrom, 2005; Yudkowsky, 2008[). Extinction risk is a
distinctive feature of AI risks: **[even a catastrophic nuclear war or
engineered pandemic]{.mark} that killed billions [would still likely
allow survivors]{.mark} to eventually rebuild human civilization**,
while [AIs]{.mark} killing billions [would]{.mark} likely [not]{.mark}
leave survivors.]{.underline} (Sandberg & Bostrom, 2008). However, a
national monopoly on an AI intelligence explosion could also have
permanent consequences if it was used to stably establish its position.
Permanent totalitarianism is one possibility (Caplan, 2008).

#### Their defense is politicized skepticism to support an anti-regulatory stance

Tool." https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/9/9/209}//JM

The purpose of this paper is to explore the [potential for [skepticism
about artificial superintelligence]{.mark} to be [used for
political]{.mark}]{.underline} [[ends]{.underline}]{.mark}. Artificial
superintelligence (for brevity, henceforth just superintelligence)
refers to AI that is much smarter than humans. [Current AI is not
superintelligent, but the prospect of superintelligence is a topic of
much discussion in scholarly and public spheres]{.underline}. [Some
believe that [superintelligence]{.mark}]{.underline} could someday be
built, and that, if it is built, it [[would have massive]{.mark} and
potentially [catastrophic consequences]{.mark}.]{.underline} Others are
skeptical of these beliefs. While much of the existing skepticism
appears to be honest intellectual debate, there is potential for it to
be politicized for other purposes. In simple terms (to be refined
below), [politicized skepticism can be defined as public articulation of
skepticism that is intended to achieve some outcome other than an
improved understanding of the topic at hand]{.underline}. Politicized
skepticism can be contrasted with intellectual skepticism, which seeks
an improved understanding. Intellectual skepticism is essential to
scholarly inquiry; politicized skepticism is not. The distinction
between the two is not always clear; [statements of skepticism may have
both intellectual and political motivations]{.underline}. The two
concepts can nonetheless be useful for understanding debates over issues
such as superintelligence. [[There is **substantial precedent for
politicized skepticism**]{.mark}. Of particular relevance for
**[superintelligence is politicized skepticism about technologies and
products that are risky but profitable]{.mark}, henceforth risk--profit
politicized skepticism**.]{.underline} This practice dates to 1950s
[debates over the link between tobacco and cancer]{.underline} and has
since been dubbed the tobacco strategy \[1\]. More recently, [the
strategy has been applied to other issues including the
link]{.underline} between fossil fuels and acid rain[,]{.underline} the
link [between fossil fuels and global warmin]{.underline}g[, and the
link between industrial chemicals and neurological disease]{.underline}
\[1,2\]. [The essence of the strategy is to promote the idea that the
science underlying certain risks is unresolved, and therefore the
implicated technologies should not be regulated. The strategy is
typically employed by an interconnected mix of industry interests and
ideological opponents of regulation]{.underline}. [The target audience
is typically a mix of government officials and the general
public]{.underline}, and not the scientific community. As is discussed
in more detail below, [certain factors suggest the potential for
superintelligence to be a focus of risk--profit politicized
skepticism.]{.underline} First and foremost, **[superintelligence [could
be developed by major corporations with a strong financial incentive to
avoid regulation]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Second, there already exists a
lot of skepticism about superintelligence, which could be exploited for
political purposes. Third, as an unprecedented class of technology, it
is inherently uncertain, which suggests that superintelligence
skepticism may be especially durable, even within apolitical scholarly
communities. These and other factors do not guarantee that
superintelligence skepticism will be politicized, or that its
politicization would follow the same risk--profit patterns as the
tobacco strategy. However, these factors are at least suggestive of the
possibility. [Superintelligence skepticism may also be
politicized]{.underline} in a different way: [to protect the reputations
and funding of the broader AI field]{.underline}. This form of
politicized skepticism is less well-documented than the tobacco
strategy, and appears to be less common. However, there are at least
hints of it for fields of technology involving both grandiose future
predictions and more mundane near-term work. AI is one such field of
technology, in which grandiose predictions of superintelligence and
other future AI breakthroughs contrast with more modest forms of
near-term AI. Another example is nanotechnology, in which grandiose
predictions of molecular machines contrast with near-term nanoscale
science and technology \[3\]. The basis of the paper's analysis is
twofold. First, the paper draws on the long history of risk--profit
politicized skepticism. This history suggests certain general themes
that may also apply to superintelligence. Second, the paper examines
characteristics of superintelligence development to assesses the
prospect of skepticism being used politically in this context. To that
end, the paper draws on the current state of affairs in the AI sector,
especially for artificial general intelligence, which is a type of AI
closely related to superintelligence. [The paper further seeks to inform
efforts to **avoid any potential harmful effects from politicized
superintelligence skepticism**.]{.underline} The effects would not
necessarily be harmful, but the history of risk--profit politicized
skepticism suggests that they could be. This paper contributes to
literatures on politicized skepticism and superintelligence governance.
Whereas most literature on politicized skepticism (and similar concepts
such as denial) is backward-looking, consisting of historical analysis
of skepticisms that have already occurred \[1,2,4--7\], this paper is
largely (but not exclusively) forward-looking, consisting of prospective
analysis of skepticisms that could occur at some point in the future.
Meanwhile, the superintelligence governance literature has looked mainly
at institutional regulations to prevent research groups from building
dangerous superintelligence and support for research on safety measures
\[8--11\]. This paper contributes to a smaller literature on the role of
corporations in superintelligence development \[12\] and on social and
psychological aspects of superintelligence governance \[13\]. This paper
does not intend to take sides on which beliefs about superintelligence
are most likely to be correct. Its interest is in the potential
political implications of superintelligence skepticism, not in the
underlying merits of the skepticism. The sole claim here is that the
possibility of politicized superintelligence skepticism is a worthy
topic of study. It is worth studying due to: (1) the potential for large
consequences if superintelligence is built; and (2) the potential for
superintelligence to be an important political phenomenon regardless of
whether it is built. Finally, the topic is also of inherent intellectual
interest as an exercise in prospective socio-political analysis on a
possible future technology. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2
presents a brief overview of superintelligence concerns and skepticisms.
Section 3 further develops the concept of politicized skepticism and
surveys the history of risk--profit politicized skepticism, from its
roots in tobacco to the present day. Section 4 discusses prospects for
politicized superintelligence skepticism. Section 5 discusses
opportunities for constructive action. Section 6 concludes.

## AT Blockchain Bad

### 2AC -- Blockchain Good

#### Blockchain solves nuclear war, climate change, and disease.

**Burford 21** -- Lyndon Burford is a Visiting Research Associate at the
Centre for Science and Security Studies, King's College London and a

Vatican's COVID-19 Commission. (International Affairs, \"Could

[New]{.underline} and maturing [tech]{.underline}nologies are often
[seen as possible]{.underline} **[drivers of conflict]{.underline}**,
not least in the context of rising nuclear risks. In 2019, for example,
the UK House of Lords Select Committee on International Relations
concluded, "The risk of the use of nuclear weapons has increased, in the
context of rising inter-state competition, a more multipolar world, and
the development of new capabilities and technologies." In a recent
policy report published by the Centre for Science and Security Studies
at King's College London, I explored the flipside of that coin. The
trust machine: [blockchain in]{.underline} nucl**[ear
disarmament]{.underline}** and arms control [verification]{.underline}
looks [at how]{.underline} [blockchain]{.underline} technology [could
help]{.underline} to **[reduce]{.underline}** [nuclear
risks]{.underline}, [by]{.underline} strengthening systems to verify the
**[dismantlement]{.underline}** [of nuclear warheads]{.underline}.

The 'trust machine'

[Blockchain]{.underline} is best known as the technology that underpins
the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, but it already [has a]{.underline} **[wide
range]{.underline}** [of alternative]{.underline} uses [in]{.underline}
areas such as **[medicine]{.underline}**, **[transport]{.underline}**,
**[manufacturing]{.underline}**, **[finance]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[governance]{.underline}**. During the COVID-19
crisis, [blockchain]{.underline} was [used to produce]{.underline} a
**[cheap]{.underline}**, reliable solution for **[contact
tracing]{.underline}**. In Syria, blockchain is being used to create a
permanent record of potential war crimes, increasing the security and
integrity of the data and strengthening its admissibility as evidence in
future war crimes prosecutions.

Blockchain is a de-centralized, digital record-keeping technology. It
combines cryptography and social/economic incentives to build a shared,
permanent, and virtually un-hackable record of events, without needing
to trust a third party authority to manage the data. Unlike Bitcoin,
which is a 'public' network that allows anyone to interact with it, a
private blockchain creates a 'permissioned' network of participants who
collectively store and manage data in a way that allows them to maintain
extremely high confidence in the integrity of the data. The result is a
shared, digital record of events --- a [blockchain]{.underline} --- that
is practically immutable, [establish]{.underline}ing [a]{.underline}
**[single]{.underline}**, **[collective]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline} **[irrefutable 'truth']{.underline}** about the nature
and sequence of events within the network. In a post-truth world,
[blockchain]{.underline} thus [offers]{.underline} an
**[invaluable]{.underline}** [technical foundation for
cooperation]{.underline} among parties that have a limited basis to
trust each other, [leading to its nickname]{.underline}, ['the trust
machine']{.underline}.

[Blockchain as a]{.underline} **[disarmament]{.underline}**
[mechanism]{.underline}

At present, extremely [low levels of]{.underline} international
[trust]{.underline} [hamper]{.underline} efforts to advance **[nuclear
disarmament]{.underline}**. The [ongoing development]{.underline}
[of]{.underline} new **[nuclear weapons]{.underline}**, warheads and
increasingly capable ballistic missile defences are
[undermin]{.underline}ing the theories and practices of
[deterrence]{.underline}, and point to the resurgence of a spiral of
mistrust that characterized the Cold War nuclear arms race. Developing
robust, multilateral verification tools and processes could help to
mitigate the trust deficit. It would enable countries to pursue their
shared interests in nuclear disarmament --- reduced costs, [less chance
of escalation and nuclear use, greater scope to cooperate on global
threats like]{.underline} **[climate change]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[pandemics]{.underline}** --- by increasing
confidence that other countries are fulfilling their disarmament
commitments in good faith. One way to strengthen verification would be
to [use]{.underline} [a]{.underline} **[private
blockchain]{.underline}** to manage and store the data that a
disarmament process creates.

In a verified disarmament process, parties need to track and record
things like the status and movements of individual inspectors and weapon
parts, and the status and material holdings of different facilities.
These activities create large amounts of data that need to be stored in
a secure, permanent and transparent manner that also allows for its easy
retrieval by permissioned actors. The core attributes of blockchain
correspond closely to these requirements. The [technology]{.underline}
[would]{.underline} [allow]{.underline} parties to maintain very **[high
confidence]{.underline}** [in the immutability of verification
data]{.underline}, creating a strong technical foundation for future
cooperation from a shared, trusted baseline.

International collaborations like the 25-country International
Partnership for Nuclear Disarmament Verification and the Quad Nuclear
Verification Partnership (made up of Norway, Sweden, the United Kingdom
and the United States) are already exploring how nuclear-armed and
non-nuclear-armed states can cooperate in verifying the dismantlement of
nuclear warheads without revealing sensitive information. [Blockchain
could]{.underline} **[complement]{.underline}** their
[approach]{.underline}, [enabling countries to create a permanent,
immutable record of verification data.]{.underline}

[Nuclear weapons]{.underline} [threaten the]{.underline}
**[survival]{.underline}** [of humanity]{.underline} [and
divert]{.underline} tens of billions of [dollars]{.underline} each year
away [from efforts to address]{.underline} other **[collective security
challenges]{.underline}** [like]{.underline} mitigating and adapting to
**[climate change]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} responding to
pandemics like **[COVID-19.]{.underline}** As such, we all share an
interest in disarmament processes that can reduce the likelihood of
deliberate or accidental nuclear explosions and free up urgently needed
resources for other global security priorities. [We owe it to ourselves
and to future generations to consider all options that could help to
advance nuclear disarmament. In addressing the regular obstacle of
distrust between the nuclear powers, blockchain is one technological
option that we should be exploring.]{.underline}

#### Solves water shortages

**Stinson 18** -- Project Lead, Water Initiative, World Economic Forum

insecurity,\" World Economic Forum, 3-22-2018,

The **[global water]{.underline}** and sanitation [crisis]{.underline}
[is]{.underline} **[not]{.underline}** [a]{.underline} [new
story]{.underline}. Each World Water Day we review the sobering
statistics with which we are becoming all too familiar: the expected
**[40% gap]{.underline}** [in]{.underline} **[global
water]{.underline}** **[supply and demand]{.underline}**
[by]{.underline} **[2050]{.underline}**. The billions of additional
dollars still needed to finance water infrastructure. The 4.5 billion
people who lack access to safely managed sanitation services. The fact
that [water crises]{.underline} have [ranked among the]{.underline}
**[top]{.underline}** [global risks]{.underline} in terms of potential
impact seven years in a row.

What these sorts of statistics remind us is that status quo approaches
are not going to be enough to solve the world's water and sanitation
problems. [Innovating]{.underline} in this domain [is]{.underline} **[no
longer]{.underline}** [an option]{.underline} but a necessity.
[Harnessing the rapid advancements]{.underline} in technology and
information [represented by the]{.underline} **[Fourth Industrial
Revolution]{.underline}** (4IR) [holds]{.underline} **[great
promise]{.underline}** [for improving the way we manage global commons
challenges]{.underline}, including water. But how do we turn this
promise into reality?

The World Economic Forum\'s Global Water Initiative, in collaboration
with the World Bank Water Global Practice and the Swiss Agency for
Development and Cooperation, has embarked on a journey over the past
year to explore this very question. By convening water policy experts,
entrepreneurs and technology innovators in a series of workshops and
meetings, we gained valuable insight into several areas that are ripe
for disruption in the water sector. [Encouragingly, we also discovered
many of the solutions we need are already at our fingertips. Here are
five examples how the 4IR could help make water insecurity a thing of
the past:]{.underline}

**[Blockchain]{.underline}** [for]{.underline}
**[improved]{.underline}** [water resource management]{.underline}

[By providing a]{.underline} **[secure]{.underline}**,
**[transparent]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[distributed]{.underline}** [ledger]{.underline} to record
transactions between parties, blockchain-based technology could
fundamentally transform the way water resources are managed and traded.
First and foremost, [harnessing this capability could enable everyone
from households, industry consumers, water managers and policymakers to
access the same data on water quality and quantity and make more
informed decisions]{.underline}. Such **[transparency]{.underline}**
[would help inform consumer decisions around when to conserve or use
water]{.underline}. It could in turn help prevent corrupt behaviour in
situations where there may be an incentive for local authorities to
tamper with or withhold water quality data.

[Blockchain]{.underline} technology [could]{.underline} also
[support]{.underline} **[peer-to-peer]{.underline}** [trading of water
rights]{.underline} in a given basin, empowering water users who have
enough or are willing to share their excess resources with others in the
area to do so 24/7 without relying on a centralized authority. [Imagine
a scenario where farmers in the same water basin could make the decision
to trade their allocations based on the latest weather data, crop
prices, market trends and longer term climate trends -- much of which is
already accessible via their mobile devices.]{.underline}

This [type of transparent, real-time approach to water management could
greatly mitigate tensions within and across certain localities by
democratizing access to information and preventing the tampering of
data. Power Ledger is among the companies pioneering blockchain
applications for the water sector, as is evidenced by its current work
with the city of Freemantle in Australia to create a blockchain-backed
trading system that leverages smart water metering data.]{.underline}

#### Otherwise, extinction.

Initiative at the Atlantic Council in Washington, DC. (Peter, \"Water
Wars: The Next Great Driver of Global Conflict?,\" National Interest,

https://nationalinterest.org/feature/water-wars-the-next-great-driver-global-conflict-13842,
Accessed 7-21-2022, LASA-SC)

[We live in an age of **great anxiety** about threats to global peace
and stability.]{.underline} Among these are worries that [intense
**water-related stresses**]{.underline}, now showing up in regions
around the world, [may become **all-too-common sources of
conflict**.]{.underline} Just as often, however, [concerns about water
wars are dismissed as much ado about nothing.]{.underline} An
influential school of thought has long contended future international
conflicts will not be fought over this resource. Water, it says, is of
such elemental importance to human existence that even long-time
adversaries will be forced to accommodate one another's needs in a
water-scarce future. As water is too expensive to transport over long
distances, moreover, it is very difficult to steal or plunder. And
history gives some comfort to this forecast: as few wars have been
fought specifically over water, it is highly unlikely humanity will
start engaging in water conflicts now. Or so the thinking goes.

[In the case of water, this logic --- of the past as predictor of the
future --- is compelling and comforting.]{.underline} [But it also is
**dangerously myopic**]{.underline}, for it [fails to consider the
possibility that the future **may look nothing at all like the
past**]{.underline}. From nearly any standpoint, the world we live in is
a fundamentally different place compared with the past. [Over just the
last century, for example, the global population has rocketed upward
from roughly two billion to well past seven billion]{.underline}. While
population growth is hardly the only driver of social, economic, and
ecological change at global and regional scale, it has been among the
most important. Nor is this process at an end. Current demographic
projections forecast a global population of at least nine billion by
2050 --- and possibly more.

Water in the Anthropocene:

Population growth provides a fitting illustration of the rapid pace of
change in the modern world. No consequence is more important than what
has been done to nature. [Humans have so drastically altered the Earth
that scientists now question whether we remain in the Holocene, the
12,000-year-old geological epoch during which all of recorded human
history has occurred.]{.underline} Instead, increasingly they speak of
the Earth as having entered a new epoch, the Anthropocene. The basic
idea behind the Anthropocene is that human activity has so thoroughly
disrupted the Earth's core processes (for instance, its nitrogen cycle
or sediment flows) that the planet no longer can be said to function
according to the familiar rhythms of the Holocene. Human interference in
the Earth's carbon cycle, for example, has changed the planet's climate
and in the process altered rainfall patterns, accelerated glacial
melting, increased air and sea temperatures, and much else. Gone is the
Holocene's stable climate; here is the Anthropocene's unstable one.

While there is some debate amongst scientists and others about whether
the Anthropocene will lead to a better or worse future, nearly everyone
involved in the discussion agrees that the Earth of the future will not
resemble its past. From here forward, we face an unfamiliar planet that
will throw our assumptions about nearly everything out the window.

[No resource stands to be **more affected**]{.underline} by the arrival
of the Anthropocene [than **fresh water**]{.underline}. Finite and
increasingly scarce in many parts of the world, [fresh water remains the
most vital single input for everything from food production, energy
generation, and manufacturing to human health, social development, and
economic modernization.]{.underline} Unlike oil, **[water has no
substitute]{.underline}**, [making access to it nothing less than a
matter of existential importance to every living creature on
Earth]{.underline}.

Yet [despite its monumental role in local and **international
affairs**]{.underline}, [water ironically remains completely
undervalued,]{.underline} pumped and consumed virtually free of charge
across much of the world. We essentially pump water as we breathe
oxygen; it is a learned reflex, central to our ability to survive and
thrive as a species. Nicknames like "blue gold" and "oil of the 21st
century" attest to the value of fresh water and its importance to
everyday affairs throughout the world.

While every country's water equation is different[, at a global scale
the basic problem is that **demand for water is soaring while water
supplies are being squeezed**]{.underline}. On the demand side, the
challenge results from an inexorable combination of global economic and
population growth combined with water-use inefficiencies. [On the supply
side, the problem results not just from exhaustion of the world's stock
of fresh water capital, as is happening to groundwater reservoirs nearly
everywhe]{.underline}re. Fresh water supply is also becoming less
predictable as climate change sets in---shifting rainfall and snowfall
patterns and increasing evaporation rates are giving us more frequent
droughts and floods.

The upshot is that the arrival of the Anthropocene foreshadows a world
where received wisdom may no longer be a reliable guide to the future[.
Water insecurity from drought, excessive groundwater extraction, and
changed seasonal precipitation patterns is affecting]{.underline} --- or
soon [will affect]{.underline} --- [regions as diverse as]{.underline}
the **[Middle East, South Asia, the Caribbean, northern
China]{.underline}**, sub-**[Saharan Africa, the western United
States]{.underline}**, **[and many more.]{.underline}**

Water Geopolitics:

Much as oil shaped the global geopolitics of the 20th century, [water
has the power to reorder international relations in the current
century]{.underline}. The [world's emerging water geopolitics are
complicated,]{.underline} as fresh water resources are distributed
unevenly across the globe. There are great water powers, blessed with
enormous renewable reserves (Brazil, Russia, the United States, Canada,
and China round out the top five). But even within these huge countries,
water availability is not uniform, with southern Brazil, the western
United States, northern China, and other sub-regions facing intense
water stress.

Far more numerous than the water powers are the water have-nots, [a
growing list of countries suffering through a perfect storm of rapid
population growth, resource depletion, poor governance, economic
stagnation, and unsettling climate change impacts, all within the
context of chronic aridity.]{.underline} The **[most water-fragile among
them]{.underline}** [are concentrated in]{.underline} a strategically
significant belt stretching from **[North Africa across the Middle East
and Horn of Africa into Central, South, and East Asia.]{.underline}**
[It is in these naturally arid or semi-arid countries where water
scarcity has the greatest **potential to inflict serious
harm.**]{.underline}

[Water stress is best understood **as a precursor to
conflict**]{.underline}. While the environmental security community
generally agrees that water disputes rarely leads to interstate
violence, the same cannot be said of intrastate conflict. Here, at the
subnational level, [water disputes and instability can trigger violent
conflict, particularly in situations of existing social, political, or
economic fragility]{.underline}. Water stress acts as an accelerant,
increasing the likelihood of conflict. Moreover, water scarcity-fueled
instability can have dangerous security implications for wider
geographic regions.

Take **[Syria]{.underline}** as an example. Between 2006 and 2010, the
country was hit hard by [drought]{.underline}, which wiped out rural
livelihoods for many and [caused significant internal displacement
across the country]{.underline}. Internal displacement in turn helped
stir up a pot that boiled over into all-out civil war in Syria,
eventually spreading to Iraq. Over the last two years,
**[ISIS]{.underline}** [has viewed water access and control as a primary
strategic objective of their campaign,]{.underline} and has commandeered
hydroelectric dams, irrigation canals, reservoirs, pipelines, and other
water infrastructure to cement territorial gains.

[Water has played an important role in]{.underline} **[Yemen's ongoing
collapse]{.underline}**. Decades of mismanagement have left the country
--- one of the world's most water-scarce nations --- with dilapidated
water infrastructure, severely depleted groundwater reserves, and high
rates of water-use inefficiency. Yemen's capital, Sana'a, may become the
first capital in the modern world to functionally run out of water,
possibly as soon as 2025.

In **[Pakistan,]{.underline}** meanwhile, runaway population growth and
[shifting rainfall patterns threaten its water outlook]{.underline}.
With a massive population set to nearly double in the next 35 years,
[Pakistan's demand on its very limited water resources will intensify in
a way that is almost unimaginable.]{.underline} Already, the country is
one of the most water scarce on earth. In a nod to water's importance in
shaping the region, [many Pakistani militant groups long hostile to
India have supplanted protests over Indian control of Kashmir with more
specific protests over access to Kashmir's most valuable resource ---
water.]{.underline}

[Other countries]{.underline} join Syria, Iraq, Yemen, and Pakistan [on
the list of nations facing a similar combination of water
stress]{.underline} [and social and political insecurity]{.underline}.
They include [conflict-prone countries of geopolitical significance,
including]{.underline} **[Iran, Afghanistan, Egypt, Libya, Nigeria, and
Somalia.]{.underline}** Even more worrisome, global heavyweights such as
China, India, and even the United States face uncomfortable futures
given mismatches between forecasted demand for water and squeezed
sources of supply. While there is no reason to believe that the latter
states will suffer from the same forms of insecurity as those countries
in the arc of crisis, neither will they be exempted from the blunt
realities of a water-stressed world.

### 2AC -- AT: Terror

#### The impact of blockchain on terror is limited

**Singer 21** -- Andrew has been a professional writer and editor for
more than 30 years. He received an M.A. in statistics from Columbia
University in 2017 and has since been working as a freelance writer with
a specialty in machine learning, artificial intelligence, blockchain
technology and big data. (Andrew Singer, \"Terrorists still raise money
through crypto, but the impact is limited,\" Cointelegraph, 4-9-2021,
https://cointelegraph.com/news/terrorists-still-raise-money-through-crypto-but-the-impact-is-limited,
Accessed 7-23-2022, LASA-SC)

We're living today "amidst an explosion of risk related to fraud, money
laundering, terrorist financing, and data privacy," said United States
Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen in February --- and she specifically
cited [cryptocurrencies]{.underline} as [a]{.underline} "**[tool to
finance terrorism]{.underline}**."

Yellen appeared to be flagging an important new turn in the war against
terror, and it begged some questions: Is crypto in the hands of
terrorists a real, present danger to governments and society? If so,
should the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry be worried?

Recent evidence suggests that [crypto's role as an enabler of
terrorism]{.underline} globally [remains]{.underline} **[relatively
minor]{.underline}**. "[Cryptocurrencies]{.underline} have been used in
several terror finance cases, but it has **[not yet]{.underline}**
become [a]{.underline} primary [means of terror financing]{.underline},"
Matthew Levitt, director of the Jeanette and Eli Reinhard Program on
Counterterrorism and Intelligence at The Washington Institute for Near
East Policy, told Cointelegraph.

Gina Pieters, assistant teaching professor in the Department of
Economics at the University of Chicago, told Cointelegraph: "Her
\[Yellen's\] statement is factually true --- it is a tool." But Yellen
also chose her words carefully. "She did not say it was a major tool ---
she specifically said it was a growing one. And that is also true, as
cryptocurrencies grow they will be used in more criminal activities."

Increasing apprehensions about crypto?

Dave Jevans, CEO of CipherTrace, expressed some unease about the
treasury secretary's remarks. "If leaders like Janet Yellen set a
fearful attitude toward cryptocurrencies associated with criminality,
regulators could take harsh action to impose more strict rules on
cryptocurrency transactions that may not be warranted," he told
Cointelegraph, adding: "Such action, like the blanket cryptocurrency ban
in India, would greatly inhibit mass adoption and innovation in the
space."

"I think she wanted to raise the issue and put it on people's radar,"
remarked Levitt, who added that misuse of cryptocurrencies looms as more
of a geopolitical concern with regard to states trying to evade Western
political sanctions --- like Russia, Iran or Venezuela --- than with
would-be terrorists.

Still, it doesn't take much money to finance a terrorist act, so any
help that Bitcoin (BTC) or other cryptocurrencies provide to terrorist
groups that are trying to obscure their funding sources remains a worry.
For that reason, Jesse Spiro, chief of government affairs at
Chainalysis, told Cointelegraph that Yellen wasn't exactly exaggerating
the threat. That said, "Terrorism financing represents an incredibly
small portion of cryptocurrency transactions." In 2020, Chainalysis
traced just 37.35 Bitcoin that went toward terrorism financing, or "a
mere 0.00324 per cent of the overall illicit activity," he said.

Crypto becoming more important for terror groups?

In August 2020, the U.S. Department of Justice seized the cryptocurrency
accounts of three Middle East-based terrorist financing operations. This
was the "largest ever seizure of terrorist organizations' cryptocurrency
accounts," according to the DoJ. "It is a fact that jihadi groups, led
by ISIS and Al-Qaeda, have been using cryptocurrency for years," Steven
Stalinsky, executive director at the Middle East Media Research
Institute, told Cointelegraph. "Following the fall of ISIS's caliphate,
it quickly became even more important for them."

In its daily monitoring of jihadi groups online, MEMRI sees groups and
individuals discussing the use of different cryptocurrencies, "But this
use has not recently developed to the extreme proportions that it could
have and still might," said Stalinsky. "[Any arrests and public news of
jihadis using cryptocurrency has so far led to the companies acting to
shut down these and related accounts, and this seems to be creating a

A 2019 Rand Corporation study noted that "[No current cryptocurrency

financial needs]{.underline}**" --- [which include anonymity, usability,
security, reliability and acceptance]{.underline} --- but
cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, "[particularly with improved usability,
could be appealing to use in fundraising, and some evidence is emerging
that terrorist organizations might be using cryptocurrencies for this
purpose.]{.underline}" It is critical for such groups to be able to
receive money from donors, beyond the gaze of governments.

The international system has undergone a number of changes, the latest
of which include the 'emergence' or 're-emergence' (as in the case of
China and India) of 'new' countries as powerful players in the system.
This is primarily due to the economic growth of Asian countries, which
has lead to a greater degree of multipolarity in the international
system; power is now calculated not only in military terms but in
economic terms as well. With the end of the Cold War in 1989 and the
subsequent collapse of the USSR, the U.S. emerged as the most powerful
state in the global arena. However, [rapid economic growth of countries
like China also meant that players emerged in the global arena that, as
a virtue of their growing economic clout, now have a **voice in
determining international affairs**. The [rise of]{.mark} [China]{.mark}
as a significant player in international politics is often [viewed with
suspicion]{.mark}]{.underline}, and questions emerge whether it will
challenge the traditional hegemony that the U.S. has had. In order to
answer whether the rise of China in international relations is a
peaceful one or whether it is a Thucydides trap, [it is **[essential to
understand what China means by]{.mark} a ["peaceful" rise]{.mark}**
(later replaced with peaceful development) followed by a closer look at
the theory and history of great power politics.]{.underline}

[The concept of "peaceful rise"]{.underline} (Zhongguo heping jueqi) was
an official policy which emerged under the leadership of Hu Jintao. The
term [was an [attempt to rebut against]{.mark} the "[China
threat]{.mark} [theory]{.mark}". The "peaceful rise" concept sought to
characterise China as a responsible world player, emphasising soft power
and that China is committed to its own internal issues and improving the
welfare needs of its citizens before interfering in world
affairs.]{.underline} However, the usage of the term "rise" was seen as
controversial since the word could lead to perceptions that China's
"rise" is a threat to the established international order. Therefore,
since 2004, the term has been replaced with "peaceful development"
(Zhongguo heping fazhan). The need to come up with such a concept arose
because, as has been seen in the past, the emergence of a new pole of
power has often resulted in drastic changes in the global political
structures and even war -- which is well-explained through the theory of
hegemonic stability and that of offensive realism in particular in
International Relations.

The term "peaceful rise" was coined by Zheng Bijian in late 2003.
According to Zheng, the rise of new powers in the past lead to an
imbalance in the global political structures and war because these
powers chose the road of aggression and expansion. Zheng Bijian's
inspiration for the concept arose during an official visit to the U.S.
in December 2002 where he reportedly experienced the pervasive discourse
of the "China threat" and "China collapse" first hand. As prescribed by
Zheng, the People's Republic of China will develop peacefully and, in
turn, help to maintain a peaceful environment. The speech given by Zheng
was at the Boao Forum for Asia in Hainan province. The real attempt
behind the introduction of the concept was to provide the international
audience an introductory glimpse of the new strategic thinking that was
emerging in China based on newer conceptualizations of power.

[In addition to the [promotion of]{.mark} the concept of peaceful
development, the leadership of the country has also embarked on a
program of "neighbourhood [diplomacy]{.mark}," emphasising good
neighbourliness and friendship and partnership; China has furthermore
asserted that, unlike Western powers, it can rise peacefully due to its
unique Confucian cultural tradition. [However]{.mark}, **[history
suggests]{.mark} that when a [rapidly]{.mark} [rising power
threatens]{.mark} an [established power]{.mark}, [competition]{.mark}
inevitably [leads to conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline} [-- the Thucydides
trap in other words.]{.underline} According to a reading of European
imperial history by scholars such as Kenneth Waltz and Raler & Thomson,
states seek to maximise their security and therefore their power, which
inevitably leads to inter-state military competition. More recently,
John Mearsheimer has undertaken an analysis of the Asia-Pacific region,
which is now a region of emerging powers. In his book titled the Tragedy
of Great Power Politics (published in 2001) he stated that the rise of
China in the 21st century will be fraught with challenges. Against this,
as stated previously, stands the Chinese leadership's concept of
peaceful development, which essentially states that Chinese development
will not threaten the established order. Dr. Yuan-kan Wang, in his book
Harmony and War: Confucian Culture and Chinese Power Politics, seeks to
address the question of whether the Confucian exceptionalism will exempt
China from the traditional patterns of conflict or not. The study
undertaken by Dr. Wang challenges the popular narrative of China's
historic cultural pacifism, and states that [the Confucian tradition is
used as a legitimising mechanism for its development and growing
military power]{.underline}. Dr. Wang's conclusion posits that **[[China
will]{.mark} gradually [shift to]{.mark} an [offensive grand]{.mark}
[strategy]{.mark} [once it has accumulated sufficient]{.mark}
[power]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

[As posited by offensive realism, China's attempts to dominate the
region will increase with its increasing clout, just the way the U.S.
dominates the Western Hemisphere. The reason behind this is that the
best way to survive in international anarchy is to be the sole regional
hegemon]{.underline}. [[China has ongoing]{.mark} and often
[violent]{.mark} territorial [conflicts with]{.mark} the
[Philippines]{.mark}, [Japan]{.mark}, [Vietnam]{.mark},
[Indonesia]{.mark}, [India]{.mark}, [Malaysia]{.mark} and
[Brunei]{.mark}. With growing economic clout, **China's
[policies]{.mark} towards territorial disputes [have become more
aggressive]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This is exactly in line with what has
happened in the Western Hemisphere and the U.S., and what is posited by
the theory of offensive realism. [With increasing economic might,
domination is the best way to survive under international anarchy. The
[more powerful China is]{.mark}, the [better it will be able to]{.mark}
[settle]{.mark} its [disputes]{.mark} [according to terms that]{.mark}
[it]{.mark} [favours]{.mark}.]{.underline}

An example of Beijing's hegemonic aspirations is the Asia Investment and
Infrastructure Bank (AIIB), which is an alternative that China is
providing to the multilateral institutions of the Bretton Woods system.
This is a potential vanguard for an alternative economic order. It also
is a reflection of Chinese ambitions to emerge as a powerful alternative
in the international economic order -- clearly what is prescribed by the
theory of offensive realism. AIIB's creation and existence simply mean
that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, which
have been the dominant players in development lending and financial
regulation, now have an Asian counterpart. The Bretton Woods
institutions in the form of the IMF and the World Bank so far have been
promoting the political world views of their most powerful members. Now,
the AIIB will play a similar role -- promoting political and economic
interests of its powerful members, and China's interest will certainly
feature prominent on the agenda.

[Another example of the fact that the ["rise" will not be as peaceful as
has been put forth]{.mark} by the concepts of peaceful rise/peaceful
development, and will be more on the lines of a Thucydides trap, are
incursions undertaken by the People's Liberation Army]{.underline} in
September 2014 when Xi Jinping was on an official visit to India and in
discussions with the Indian Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, on issues
that would impact peace and development of the entire region. [Concepts
of **"neighbourhood diplomacy" and "peaceful development" dissipated in
the face of Chinese aggression**.]{.underline} This is remindful of the
American attempts at regional hegemony in history. After independence in
1783, the U.S. over the next seven decades created a powerful country.
Wiping out Native Americans in large numbers, plundering land and
property, purchasing Florida from Spain in 1819, annexing Texas in 1845
and waging war with Mexico in 1846 -- these were all a part of its goal
of establishing American hegemony in the region. President James Monrof
e articulated the Monroe Doctrine in 1823. According to the Doctrine,
U.S. intervention was deemed necessary to prevent European nations'
colonisation efforts. By the end of the nineteenth century, the European
great powers had become minor players in the Americas. The U.S. achieved
regional hegemony and this, in turn, led it to become a secure great
power.

[If this example from history was to be taken and the Chinese case was
to be juxtaposed, then not too many differences would be found. The
**increased [aggression]{.mark} that China has been displaying [in
Asia]{.mark}**, its **[active suppression of]{.mark} Tibetan/Uyghur
[dissent]{.mark}**, and the setting up of alternative economic
structures among others are all evidences of the fact that the
Thucydides trap exists and that **[there is nothing]{.mark} ["peaceful"
about China's rise]{.mark}** or development. It is simply offensive
realism -- and even though China attempts to camouflage this with
sugar-coats of Confucian traditions, concepts of "peaceful development"
and "[peaceful rise]{.mark}", this can be **regarded as [nothing less
than]{.mark} [attempts at achieving
hegemony]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline}

## AT Cyberattacks Good

### 2AC\-\--Cyber Attacks\-\--Retal

#### Even [attempted]{.underline} cyber-attacks cause [retal]{.underline}.

Not hundred per cent of the dialogue has been frozen, fortunately.
Certain informal, mostly off the-record, meetings of US and Russian
experts on cyber agenda continue taking place, both through Track 2 and
Track 1.5. One of the most intellectually stimulating meetings, with
frank exchanges, took place in Vienna in December 2018. The report
produced after the meeting stressed "the [significant risk]{.underline}
\[...\] [that cyber-attacks could]{.underline} conceivably [lead to a
**military escalation** that may further trigger a **nuclear weapons
exchange**]{.underline}, [a fact that became more explicit with the
adoption of the current]{.underline} **[N]{.underline}**uclear
**[P]{.underline}**osture **[R]{.underline}**eview. This issue gets
complicated given that [third parties may have the capabilities to
**invoke** a **cyber conflict** between **Russia** and the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates. Whether a country or
a non-state [actor]{.underline}, they [could put the two countries on
the verge of an armed conflict by attacking **critical**
**infra**]{.underline}structure [of either of them and making it
**look** as if the **aggressor** were the **other
one**]{.underline}"\[22\]. However, one should have no illusion: such
informal meetings may be fully fruitful only when their reports and
policy recommendations are utilized by the governments. And for that, a
warmer climate in bilateral relations is a must. So far, we see exactly
the opposite: mercury falling to freezing levels.

[Risk of cyber clashes growing into a **chaotic global cyber war** has
been emphasized]{.underline} by the UN Secretary-General Antonio
Guterres in his Agenda for Disarmament: "[Malicious acts in cyberspace
are contributing to **diminishing trust**]{.underline} among States...
States should implement the recommendations elaborated under the
auspices of the General Assembly, which aim at building international
confidence and greater responsibility in the use of cyberspace.\[23\]"
However, as the members of the US-Russian Track 1.5 working group on
strategic stability recently concluded, "without a constructive dialogue
on cyber issues between the United States and Russia, [the world would
most likely fail to agree on any norms of responsible
behavior]{.underline} of states in [cyber space]{.underline}"\[24\].

Do we really have to survive a cyber equivalent of the Cuban Missile
Crisis to realize the importance of achieving some kind of agreement on
cyber issues, and on the broader agenda of international information
security?\[25\] Or is that kind of talk plain old alarmism?

I don't want to sound a fatalist, but I am even less keen on sounding
like an ostrich that's buried its head in the sand. [We **cannot
ignore** the **obvious**]{.underline}: whether the world's most powerful
actors like it or not, [the world is sliding to **another major
crisis**]{.underline} like the one in 1962. [The cyber war is ***already
raging***]{.underline}. There are [**no rules** of **engagement** in
that war]{.underline}. The [**uncertainty** is **high**]{.underline}.
The [**spiral of tension** is getting **out of control**]{.underline}.
The [cyber **arms race** is gaining **momentum**]{.underline}. And there
are [no guarantees that the next crisis will be
controllable]{.underline}, or that it will result in a catharsis as far
as international information security regulation is concerned. There's
[**no telling what will happen** once the *cyber genie* is out of the
bottle]{.underline}.

### 2AC\-\--Cyber Attacks\-\--Escalates

#### Non-kinetic attacks prompt [miscalc]{.underline} and [escalate]{.underline} into [conventional warfare]{.underline}. 

John **Arquilla &** Andrew **Szarejko, 21** (John Arquilla is an
American analyst and academic of international relations and Andrew
Szarejko is a Donald R. Beall defense fellow in the Defense Analysis
Department at the Naval Postgraduate School, 12-22-2021, accessed on

HBisevac)

[Sometimes [wars]{.mark}]{.underline}, from small ones to big ones,
[[start]{.mark} [with]{.mark} **[accidents]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In
early American history, for example, accidents associated with
good-faith errors and unauthorized acts of violence precipitated several
conflicts between the United States and Native American groups. On a
larger scale, Scott Sagan has argued that the 18th-century Seven Years'
War was sparked by a false warning of French invasion and that the
Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1931 was an unauthorized attack
orchestrated by army officers against the expressed wishes of the
civilian government. [The potential for these sorts of
accidents]{.underline} --- human or technical errors and unauthorized
actions --- [to induce **subsequent escalation** has
produced]{.underline} much [diplomatic effort to mitigate the
risks]{.underline} of stumbling into armed conflict. There are hotlines,
summits, "open skies" agreements, confidence-building measures, and
more. [Yet today the risk of accidents **producing escalation**
**persists**]{.underline}, [especially where states see a **first-mover
advantage** and fear]{.underline} the [consequences of
**underreacting**]{.underline} more than the risks of over-reacting.

The [rising **salience** of **cyber warfare** contributes dangerously to
the traditional set of concerns about the **onset** of **armed
conflict**]{.underline}. Now, in addition to wars waged with bombs and
bullets, [[militaries]{.mark} have [become]{.mark} **[highly
dependent]{.mark}** [upon]{.mark} the [security]{.mark} [of]{.mark} the
***bits*** and ***[bytes]{.mark}*** [that]{.mark} **[empower]{.mark}**
their]{.underline} "[sensing and shooting]{.underline}"
**[[capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark}**. And the link between incidents
starting in cyberspace and [ending up in battlespaces]{.underline} on
land, at sea, and in the aerospace environment is getting the attention
of policymakers. So much so that, as President Joe Biden noted that
"we're going to end up, if we end up in a war --- a real shooting war
with a major power --- it's going to be a consequence of a cyber breach
of great consequence."

Some have argued that cyber operations are actually unlikely to prompt
military escalation, but we would argue that this possibility ought to
receive policymaking attention to reduce its probability. [There remains
**much [uncertainty]{.mark}** [about]{.mark} the **[frequency]{.mark}**
[and **severity**]{.mark} of cyber accidents that are **occurring now**
and [that]{.mark} [will **arise**]{.mark} in the
**future**]{.underline}. This uncertainty extends to whether any given
cyber accident will spark military escalation. But [a growing body of
[evidence]{.mark}]{.underline}, beginning with the Moonlight Maze cyber
intrusions into military systems in the late 1990s and other serious
events that have continued to this day, [[make clear]{.mark} that
potential **[adversaries]{.mark}** are [testing out]{.mark}
**[virtual]{.mark} [ways]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} **[disrupt]{.mark}
physical [operations]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

What sorts of accidents might occur in cyberspace, and how might they
prompt military escalation? We have three basic categories in mind.
First, there are [[human]{.mark} [actions]{.mark} in cyberspace that
could [provoke]{.mark} [escalation]{.mark}]{.underline}. These
[[include]{.mark} human errors]{.underline}, such as mistaken
perceptions. During the Cuban Missile Crisis, for example, a U.S.
destroyer's use of training depth charges to target a Soviet submarine
very nearly led the submarine's captain to launch a nuclear torpedo
because he reportedly believed a war might have already started. The
difficulties of ascertaining intent and attributing responsibility for
actions in cyberspace may produce similar human errors.
[Alternatively]{.underline}, [**intentional [actions]{.mark}** [not
**authorized**]{.mark} by any proper authority]{.underline} would fit
this category. [Non-state-affiliated **[hackers]{.mark}**]{.underline},
for example, [could]{.underline} individually or collectively
[[target]{.mark} or unintentionally affect **[highly sensitive
systems]{.mark}**]{.underline} such as those related to critical
infrastructure, conventional military systems, or nuclear
command-and-control processes. Similarly, [[state]{.mark}-linked
**[cyber]{.mark} [proxies]{.mark}** could [engage]{.mark} in such
actions [of]{.mark} their **[own volition]{.mark}** [and]{.mark}
[have]{.mark} their [actions]{.mark} **[incorrectly attributed]{.mark}**
to their state sponsor]{.underline}.

As a case in point, [in 2001]{.underline} through 2002, Gary
**[[McKinnon]{.underline}]{.mark}**, a Briton whose autism played a
central role in his legal defenses after he was caught, [[hacked]{.mark}
into U.S. [military]{.mark} [systems]{.mark}]{.underline} in a purported
effort to uncover information about unidentified flying objects he
believed the U.S. government was hiding. This [hack [kept]{.mark} about
**[2,000]{.mark} military [computers]{.mark} [offline]{.mark}** [for
**days**]{.mark}]{.underline}, caused alarm in the Pentagon ---
[[American]{.mark} air [defenses]{.mark} [and]{.mark} the Atlantic
Fleet's [logistics]{.mark} had been [compromised]{.mark}]{.underline}
--- and led to questions about who was targeting the United States and
who ought to face retribution. The prosecutor in charge of the effort to
extradite him from the United Kingdom described the incident as "the
biggest military computer hack of all time." Needless to say, had this
occurred during a major international crisis --- and [[had the]{.mark}
[U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates
[[failed]{.mark} [to]{.mark} sufficiently [harden]{.mark} those military
[networks]{.mark}]{.underline} despite being in a crisis --- [the
[consequences]{.mark} could have been **[dire]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Our second category of concerns is about **[[technical
errors]{.underline}]{.mark}** that [could [lead]{.mark} [to]{.mark}
military [escalation]{.mark}]{.underline}. [During the Cold
War]{.underline}, for example, there were [occasions]{.underline} on
[which the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[and]{.underline} the [Soviet Union]{.underline} each [thought the
**other** had begun a **nuclear attack**]{.underline}. In the American
case, a war-scenario training tape was mistakenly inserted and played at
a strategic command. On the Soviet side, a computer malfunction reported
that five American missiles were heading toward the Soviet Union.
Fortunately, those involved in both cases waited long enough before
retaliating to ascertain that their identification of an incoming attack
was mistaken, but [there is **[no guarantee]{.mark}** that such
[events]{.mark} will always **[resolve]{.mark}**]{.underline} so well.
That we are all still here speaks to the caution that nuclear weapons
can induce. [[In]{.mark} the [case of escalation]{.mark} to conventional
military action [from]{.mark} [cyber]{.mark} operations]{.underline},
however, [[those]{.mark} [involved]{.mark} may be **[less
cautious]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

The third category of potential problems consists of [intentional
[cyber]{.mark} [operations]{.mark}]{.underline} that [may [have
**unintended consequences**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Due to]{.mark} the
**[complexity]{.mark}** and **interconnectedness** of advanced
information systems]{.underline}, [any offensive cyber operation
engenders **uncertainty** as to the effects it will cause]{.underline}.
Thus, to the extent that human and/or technical errors could be the
source of such effects, it is worth considering them here. One could
imagine, for example, that either Israeli or Iranian cyber operations
targeting the other in their current "virtual conflict" might yield
greater consequences than the attacker intended. [[In]{.mark} an
**[already tense]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [volatile
[situation]{.mark}]{.underline}, [such a perceived
escalation]{.underline}, **[even if unintended]{.underline}**, might
[[prompt]{.mark} an [armed]{.mark}]{.underline},
"**[[kinetic]{.underline}]{.mark}**" [[response]{.underline}]{.mark}.

### 2AC\-\--Cyber Attacks\-\--Escalates\-\--Ambiguity

#### Cyber law ambiguity causes [miscalc]{.underline} that [escalates]{.underline}.

Ryan **Goodman, 18** (Ryan Goodman, Anne and Joel Ehrenkranz Professor

HBisevac)

A widely accepted view of the UN Charter is that a State can use force
in self-defense only in response to an "armed attack," which is
importantly defined as the gravest forms of force in scale and effects.
In contrast, [the [U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [has **long [maintained]{.mark}** that [a
State]{.mark} [can use]{.mark} force in **[self-defense]{.mark}**
[in]{.mark} [response]{.mark} [to]{.mark} **[any amount]{.mark}** [of
**force**]{.mark} by another State]{.underline}. The U.S. view might
have worked well when it came to bombs and battleships. There are
reasons, however, to think that the [application of the [U.S]{.mark}.
[view]{.mark} [in]{.mark} the **[cyber]{.mark} realm** may [risk]{.mark}
**unintended**, **[accidental]{.mark}**, and unnecessary **militarized
[conflicts]{.mark}**]{.underline}. That's partly because of the
uncertainty of the law in cyberspace and partly because of the
uncertainty of facts when cyber operations occur.

The U.S. position, one might think, reduces the overall risk of
militarized conflicts between States. One reason to recommend the U.S.
view is that it might enable a government to prevent escalation---for
example by using cyber-ops to impede another State's test missiles---in
response to the latter's low-level uses of force, and thus buy more time
for diplomacy to avoid a larger battle. What's more, [[if]{.mark} a
[State's]{.mark} **[hands]{.mark}** are **[tied]{.mark}** such that it
**cannot use force** to respond to a **low-level** use of force by an
aggressor]{.underline}, [it [will put **pressure**]{.mark} on
governments [to **expand**]{.mark} [what]{.mark} i[s]{.mark}
[meant]{.mark} [by]{.mark} an]{.underline} "**[[armed
attack]{.underline}]{.mark}**," which has potentially dangerous
precedential effects in the future. Those concerns, however, may not be
as relevant for the United States, which, above and beyond other States,
has a broader range of potential diplomatic, economic, and other
non-forcible, non-military means to defend its interests.

More important is deterrence. [In favor of the U.S. view]{.underline} of
the law [is that a **lower threshold** for triggering the right of
**self-defense** can **deter** **aggressors** from acting **in the first
place**]{.underline}. In terms of defensive posture, the United States
deters others who know that the American military can use its mighty
arsenal in response to any illegal use of force. [That]{.underline}
empirical [claim]{.underline}, however, [is **weaker** in a world in
which [States]{.mark} very [**frequently** engage]{.mark} in
**[low-level]{.mark} uses** of force in [cyber]{.mark}]{.underline}, or
might be thought to have done so by their adversaries. In that world,
many States will have the legal right to use force in self-defense
against others on an ongoing basis. Also, consider the U.S. offensive
posture. [The **greater extent** to which the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates, in particular, [is engaged in cyber
activities]{.underline} across the world [that will be considered a use
of force by **other States**]{.underline}, the greater license the
United States may be handing those States to use force---whether in the
cyber or kinetic realm---in response. That is, [[if]{.mark} those
[States]{.mark} [adopt]{.mark} a [view similar to]{.mark} the
[U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates
[that]{.underline} "[the inherent right of self-defense]{.underline}
potentially [applies against any illegal use of force]{.underline}."

It may have been more satisfying to the United States to operate in
world in which it maintained the legal prerogative to adopt a forcible
response in reaction to any illegal use of force while other States did
not maintain that position. Our legal world may be changing, however.
Witness, for example, Japan's recent shifts toward the U.S. position.
Taken in light of Mutual Defense Agreements, in which the United States
has accepted an obligation to support other States who have been subject
to an "armed attack," and the kinds of calculations of what makes the
world safer and better protects U.S. national security must surely
shift. More specifically, [if more U.S. allies start moving toward the
U.S. view]{.underline} of "armed attack," [the
[U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [may be
**[drawn into]{.mark} [far]{.mark}-[flung]{.mark} [cyber
conflicts]{.mark}** as an **unintended consequence**]{.underline}.

Now [add to this mix the **legal uncertainties** that exist in this
specific area of **cyber law**]{.underline}. The legal definition of
what exactly is a use of force in the cyber realm is far less settled
than in the kinetic realm. What's more, it is safe to assume that
several States around the world are frequently engaging in actions that
others might consider a use of force. Is the laying of specific types of
malware on the systems of another State in preparation for possible
future activation analogous to laying landmines in another State's
territory? The Tallinn Manual's definition of cyberattacks (at least in
the context of jus in bello) may lead one to think so, but widespread
State practice would appear to contradict that conclusion. So which is
it? Also, could the alteration or destruction of data count as a use of
force or attack? This is an area where views are developing in one
direction, but what happens in the limbo period between now and then,
when some States and legal authorities hold one view and others hold
different ones? That seems like a dangerous period for calibrating the
use of force in cyber. And those are just two examples of legal
uncertainties out of many that one could describe.

These types of legal uncertainties are compounded by factual
uncertainties in the cyber realm. [While the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [appears to have an increasingly impressive ability
to **determine attribution**]{.underline}, [[many]{.mark} other
[States]{.mark} **[lack]{.mark}** that [**sophistication** and]{.mark}
are]{.underline} thus [more **likely** to [make]{.mark}
**[costly]{.mark} [errors]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[State D]{.mark} may
**[mistake]{.mark}** a [cyber operation]{.mark} launched [by]{.mark} a
**rogue [hacker]{.mark}**]{.underline} or organized non-State group
operating [[out of]{.mark} [country Y]{.mark} [as]{.mark} being
[perpetrated]{.mark} [by]{.mark} [State Y]{.mark}
**itself**]{.underline}. And governmental or non-governmental cyber
hackers in a third country may very purposefully make it look like State
Y conducted a cyberattack. Another difficulty in the cyber realm is
determining whether certain effects of a hostile cyber operation were
intended by the attacker. For example, [[State D may detect]{.mark} an
imminent threat of [malware]{.mark} in its systems [that]{.mark} appears
would]{.underline} at least [temporarily [compromise]{.mark} its most
sensitive [military]{.mark} arsenal]{.underline}---[but [is]{.mark}
[that]{.mark} what the perpetrator **[intended]{.mark}**]{.underline}
(and how, as a legal issue, should that question of intentionality
matter)[[?]{.underline}]{.mark}

In cyberspace, many of these actions and interactions will take place at
greater speeds thanks, in part, to artificial intelligence. These
[[conditions]{.mark} may **[shrink]{.mark}** the **[window of
time]{.mark}** for political and military leaders to **make
decisions**]{.underline}, [and [place **pressure**]{.mark} on them **[to
pre-authorize]{.mark}** [or]{.mark} create **[auto]{.mark}mated
[response]{.mark}s**]{.underline}. It is not hard to imagine tit-for-tat
uses of force quickly ascending a ladder of escalation. And there is no
legal reason the rungs of that ladder will remain confined to the cyber
realm.

Yet [[Iran will]{.mark} continue to [be **limited** by **resource
constraints**]{.mark} for the foreseeable future. [Tehran]{.mark} has
**[rarely]{.mark}** appeared able to [conduct **large-scale**]{.mark}
exfiltration of classified business and government data,
**differing**]{.underline}, for example, [from Chinese
[efforts]{.mark}]{.underline} to steal Boeing's industrial secrets or
extensive databases from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management.142
What's more, [the **[threshold of difficulty]{.mark}** for compromising
such targets [will **increase**]{.mark} **over time**, and [it is
**unclear**]{.mark} whether [Iranian capabilities will improve
proportionally]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Iran's [massive **brain drain**]{.mark}, with many of its brightest
engineers leaving for political and economic reasons, [imposes **further
constraints**]{.mark} on the development of its cyber
capabilities]{.underline}. Iran's minister of science, research and
technology estimated that [**[150,000]{.mark}** highly talented people
**[emigrate]{.mark}** from Iran **[every year]{.mark}**]{.underline}, a
\$150 billion annual economic loss.143 [When Iranian engineers
leave]{.underline} for Silicon Valley and Europe, [the country's
[capacity for]{.mark} effective]{.underline} offensive and defensive
[[cyber]{.mark} operations **[goes with them]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

In the absence of a historical comparison of Iranian cyber operations,
[[new incidents]{.underline}]{.mark} or the rise of new groups [is
[often **incorrectly** perceived as]{.mark} a dramatic
[improvement]{.mark} to capacity]{.underline}. Despite systemic
challenges stemming from bureaucratic dysfunction and underinvestment in
cybersecurity, Iran has the potential to foster more effective
operations. Attempts by the government, universities, and the private
sector to create a professional cybersecurity community, such as hosting
Capture the Flag tournaments, will inevitably result in a deeper talent
pool. Observing other nation-state actors provides a set of benchmarks
that can be a reliable indicator of improvement or change in posture,

Washington Post,
https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/06/17/war-with-iran-is-probably-less-likely-than-you-think/

**[Why war with Iran might be less likely than you think]{.underline}**.
[Last week, an attack on two tankers in the Gulf of Oman raised tensions
between the United States and Iran --- on the heels of a similar attack
in May.]{.underline} Though Iran denied responsibility, Secretary of
State Mike Pompeo said intelligence evidence showed Iran was to blame,
and President Trump concurred that "Iran did do it." Although questions
remain in some quarters about the attack's nature and source, on Sunday
on CBS's "Face the Nation," Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) said the
evidence Iran was responsible is "very strong and compelling." [As was
true when the United States and North Korea exchanged bellicose rhetoric
in 2017 and early 2018, **many are now worried that the U.S. and Iran
are heading for war**]{.underline}. When Trump was warning that North
Korea faced "fire and fury" if it threatened the United States, we wrote
about why, despite the rhetoric, war was unlikely. [This time, some
factors are indeed pushing the two sides toward conflict. But **[forces
of restraint are]{.mark} also [reducing]{.mark} the [likelihood of
war.]{.mark}**]{.underline} Tensions can lead to a "spiral" of
escalation. Both the United States and Iran say that they do not want a
war, but that they are prepared to fight if the other side starts one.
[What's worrisome is what political scientists call the spiral model of
conflict escalation]{.underline}. Sometimes, when countries take
measures they think will improve their own security, potential opponents
can perceive that as threatening --- a classic security dilemma. Those
potential opponents then take measures to improve their own security ---
which the first country sees as threatening. And so on. When countries
do not trust each other, and perhaps even fear that the other side wants
war, they are unlikely to believe conciliatory signals from the other
side, and nobody wants to appear weak. The result is a spiral of
conflict. The past few weeks' events have certainly ratcheted up
tensions. The recent tanker attack and America's decision to quickly
blame Iran only raises them further. And as Tyler Jost and Rob Schub
wrote here at TMC last month, the Trump administration's decision-making
process could make it even more difficult to navigate the tricky problem
of reading and responding to signals in a crisis like this. War would be
very costly in this case. [A conflict between Iran and the United States
could be very costly. For instance]{.underline}, in such a war, [Iran
might]{.underline} use mines to [keep ships from traveling through
traffic in the Strait of Hormuz]{.underline} --- a crucial, narrow
passage for world energy supplies. If that happened, the U.S. options
for clearing the mines would be complicated and costly, as Caitlin
Talmadge argues. Such an operation might require hitting targets inside
Iran or risk Iranian retaliation from coastal positions given the narrow
geographic chokepoint --- all pointing toward further escalation.
Knowing this, the United States might instead choose to go straight to a
bombing campaign. But coercive bombing might also lead to escalation.
[**Despite these dangers, there are still important constraints on both
sides. [Misperception rarely causes war. ]{.mark}**[The spiral model may
not be]{.mark} the [right]{.mark} way to think about how conflicts
escalate. Missed signals and miscalculation can indeed generate tension.
But **[leaders have many ways to avoid]{.mark} [conflicts]{.mark} that
they do not want to fight.** [The historical record suggests]{.mark}
that [misperception]{.mark} and accidental escalation [rarely lead to
war]{.mark} --- as Dan Reiter noted here at TMC during the height of
North Korea tensions in 2018. **Domestic political pressures don't seem
to be pushing toward war.** [The U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and
Iran]{.mark} also [face domestic pressures that]{.mark} may [make both
sides hesitate]{.mark} before escalating. Iran's economy has
suffered]{.underline} under the Trump administration's renewed
sanctions, [and]{.underline} parliamentary [elections are coming
up]{.underline}. Although the country's president, Hassan [Rouhani, has
used tough rhetoric recently, **[a costly war might not benefit Iran's
leaders, since it]{.mark} [could]{.mark} inflict further economic and
human costs, or even [lead to regime change]{.mark} or
collapse.**]{.underline} Likewise, [after nearly two decades of war in
the Middle East and Afghanistan, Americans are unlikely to welcome
another major conflict]{.underline}. Neither Trump's own party nor the
opposition Democrats has rallied the U.S. public to pressure Trump to
escalate[. As TMC's Michael Tesler noted in December, although Trump's
base supporters tend to have hawkish views, they supported his decision
to withdraw troops from Syria. If Trump does not want war with Iran, his
base would likely follow. **[The president doesn't seem eager for
war]{.mark}.** There has been much talk about a replay of the Iraq War,
with the United States using possibly flawed intelligence to justify
war.]{.underline} But [although Trump has used limited military force in
Syria, **[he seems]{.mark} generally [opposed to costly wars in the
Middle East]{.mark}**, and unlikely to embrace a new one]{.underline}.
Both Pompeo and national security adviser John Bolton are much more
hawkish on Iran, but Trump has distanced himself from his advisers'
hawkish rhetoric, particularly the most costly option: regime change.
Here's what to watch for. [So which will win out: the risks of
escalation or the pressures for restraint? **Amid all the tension, [Iran
wants its regime to survive, and Trump]{.mark} probably [does not want
to absorb a costly war]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In the coming days and
weeks, it will be telling to see if there is further daylight between
Trump and his advisers. Here's one more risk: if Trump's hawkish
advisers present an option that seems like it could be kept limited, but
actually carries a strong likelihood of escalation. [Trump]{.underline}
has embraced limited displays of force, such as airstrikes in Syria in
2017 and 2018, and he issued a threatening tweet on Iran in May. But he
[has]{.underline} also [pivoted away quickly from harsh rhetoric to
diplomacy before --- as he did toward North Korea --- and has already
achieved his campaign goal of pulling out of the nuclear deal he
disdained. **[The bottom line: Despite rising tension,]{.mark} [powerful
factors reduce the likelihood of war]{.mark} between the U.S. and Iran.
[That's unlikely to change]{.mark} anytime soon.**]{.underline}

Washington would lose a point of significant influence in Iraq, likely
granting Iran greater sway in the country. [While the possibility of an

[There is little question that [the **U**]{.mark}nited

war]{.mark}, an outcome [**not lost** on]{.mark} the [Iranians]{.mark}
when the United States quickly toppled the Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein
and routed the Taliban from power in Afghanistan.]{.underline} Just
judging by statistics, the conventional United States military dwarfs
Iran's in every way. [There are roughly 1.3 million active [American

[Iran]{.mark}. Annual military **[spending]{.mark}** by the United

vessels --- vastly outnumber Iran's. [That [does not mean]{.mark} Mr.
[Trump is **ready to back his threats**]{.mark} by invading

[is]{.mark} seen as [nonexistent]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Mr. [Trump has

[Tensions are rising [between the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[and Iran]{.mark}, but **[war is still
unlikely]{.mark}**]{.underline} -- [especially as the
**coronavirus**]{.underline} pandemic [gives both countries
**increasingly dire domestic problems** to manage]{.underline}. If the
tensions do escalate into a regional conflict, it will likely be as a
result of miscalculations or mistakes rather than deliberate strategy --
and only then if the miscalculations are lethal enough to compel a cycle
of retaliation and violence.

While American war threats and Iranian harassment tactics serve as
useful distractions from the domestic problems caused by COVID-19,
neither power has a core desire for major conflict. However, Iran's
nuclear program is always lurking. If the Iranians continue to advance
the program, eventually they will trigger a major regional conflict,
pandemic or not.

[COVID]{.underline}-19 [is **siphoning** the **limited political and
social energy** in both countries for **further serious
escalation**]{.underline}. That was already evident in the most recent
cycle of Iran-US confrontation back in March. On March 12, [US forces
launched airstrikes on Iran's **Iraqi proxy**]{.underline}, Kata'ib
Hezbollah, for a rocket attack that killed two US service members and
one UK soldier.

[But rather than **repeating the cycle of escalation**]{.underline} that
happened in late December and early January -- when the US assassinated
senior Iranian commander Gen. Qassem Soleimani, prompting Iran to launch
a cruise missile attack on the al-Assad airbase -- [this time the US
conducted proportional strikes on Kata'ib Hezbollah targets. [Iran **did
not retaliate**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [and Kata'ib
Hezbollah]{.underline}, taking its cue from its patron, **[avoided
escalation]{.underline}**.

[This was because by mid-March, both Iran and the US were coming to
grips with the **massive impact of [COVID]{.mark}**]{.underline}-19 [on
their societies and economies, **[ad]{.mark}ding** [to **pre-existing
inclinations** to **avoid**]{.mark} a major [war]{.mark}. Now [the two
are entering]{.mark} a phase of **increasingly [compartmentalized
competition]{.mark}** and conflict]{.underline}.

Iraq is the clearest proxy theater that will continue to see cycles of
violence as Iranian proxies harass US forces and US forces respond. But
[it is **clear** that both sides want to keep that confrontation
**confined to Iraq** and limited to tit-for-tat exchanges.]{.underline}

[In the Arabian Gulf]{.underline}, the site of the most recent
rhetorical confrontation between Iran and the US (when President Donald
Trump threatened to destroy Iranian ships that harassed US naval
vessels), [the situation remains **similarly contained**, with a less
likely path to escalation than Iraq]{.underline}.

[Iran faces a **huge military disadvantage** against the US Navy, and so
Iranian provocation will be likely designed to increase tension rather
than intentionally strike US ships, as Tehran knows that the US is
capable of **rapidly gutting**]{.underline} much of **[the Iranian
navy]{.underline}** -- as it did in 1988's Operation Praying Mantis.

Moreover, [it is in Iran's interests to avoid **[being]{.mark} seen as
[the aggressor]{.mark}** in the Gulf, which [would]{.mark} likely
**[undermine Tehran's efforts to bring in]{.mark} international
[aid]{.mark}** [for]{.mark} its **[COVID]{.mark}**-]{.underline}19
**[crisis]{.underline}**, [**exposing** the regime to **domestic
criticism** that its hardline tactics are imposing yet more suffering on
the Iranian people [and **eroding**]{.mark} even more
**[legitimacy]{.mark}**]{.underline} from the Islamic Republic. [These
two factors mean that [Tehran is **not in a position** to **risk
humanitarian corridors**]{.mark} in exchange [for]{.mark}
**near-[suicidal attacks on the US]{.mark} Navy**.]{.underline}

For that matter, [the US is]{.underline} increasingly [turning to a
strategy of sanctions first,]{.underline} military retaliation second.
That's because Iran's sanctions barely register in the US public, giving
the president wide leeway to continue that strategy.

Meanwhile, Americans have consistently shown a willingness to support
presidents who retaliate to provocations, meaning that it's very likely
that future harassment will be met with a US response. But [that
response will also be **limited by politics**]{.underline}: **[[few
Americans]{.underline}]{.mark}** in 2020 [[want]{.mark} to see [the
country **embroiled** in another]{.mark} major Middle Eastern [war as
they come to terms with]{.mark}]{.underline} what **[[the
pandemic]{.underline}]{.mark}** has done to their economy and society.

#### No [NoKo]{.underline} cyber-attacks.

Under what circumstances would it make sense for North Korea's Kim
regime to begin a war with the United States? The primary goal of any
state is survival, and this is even more important for politically
fragile regimes that provide immense benefit to the ruling family. [An
**[upper limit]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} [No]{.mark}]{.underline}rth
[[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}rean [[activities]{.mark} [is]{.mark}
that]{.underline}, [though it will use threats and coercive acts to
pursue its larger policy goals]{.underline}, [it will not do so at the
**expense** of its own **[survival]{.mark}**]{.underline}. There is some
risk that Kim Jong-un could miscalculate when it comes to coercive acts.
Shooting missiles over Guam would provoke a reaction, as would an
inadvertent impact on Japanese territory of a missile intended to
overfly it. But in general, [behind the bluster]{.underline}, [the
**[Kim]{.mark} regime** has been **[calculating]{.mark}** [and
**careful**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [This is the **lens** through which we
should measure the risk of **No**]{.underline}rth
**[Ko]{.underline}**rea [launching a **cyber attack** against the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates.
[[No]{.underline}]{.mark}rth [[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}rea [is the
**[least capable]{.mark}** of our opponents when it comes to cyber
attack]{.underline}. It [uses cyber techniques for **coercive
diplomacy**]{.underline}, [for criminal activities to generate **hard
currency**]{.underline}, and for disruptive actions in the South and
against deployed U.S. forces. If war breaks out, the North might also
consider cyber attacks against military or symbolic targets in the
United States. However, short of armed conflict, [[disruptive
actions]{.mark} here are **[unlikely]{.mark}**]{.underline}. How
disruptive a North Korean cyber attack would be depends on the victim's
weaknesses. North Korean successes depend on relatively basic techniques
that exploit vulnerabilities in poorly defended systems. Though the
North has used cyber attacks several times against South Korean banks
and media outlets, and against Sony in the United States, none of those
attacks caused physical destruction or casualties. To be fair, [no cyber
attack has ever caused casualties]{.underline}, and only three or four
resulted in physical damage. [[No]{.underline}]{.mark}rth
[[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}rea, [despite progress in developing its
cyber-attack capabilities]{.underline}, [**does** **[not
possess]{.mark}** the **advanced [skills]{.mark}** needed [to
**cause**]{.mark}]{.underline} physical
**[[damage]{.underline}]{.mark}**. What the North can do with cyber
operations is disrupt data and online services. A 2011 cyber attack on a
South Korean bank left customers unable to use ATMs or online services
for several days. The action deleted customer accounts and tried to
erase evidence of the attack from the bank's computers. Similar attacks
took place in 2013 against banks and media outlets in Seoul, with data
erased and services disrupted. The 2014 attack on Sony Pictures also
disrupted services and data and saw leaks of embarrassing e-mails. The
most recent North Korean cyber incident used false credentials to steal
\$81 million from the Bangladesh Central Bank. While these count as
successes, they may have also increased North Korea's caution. If you
think you are invisible and suddenly discover that you are not, it
dampens your enthusiasm for crime. The ability of the United States to
identify North Korea in the Sony incident probably led the North to
revise upward the risk of cyber action against U.S. targets. We can run
through one popular scenario to explore how North Korea might think
about cyber attacks. Though [it is **[unlikely]{.mark}** that
[No]{.mark}]{.underline}rth [[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}rea [[has]{.mark}
the [ability]{.mark} [to]{.mark} [cause blackouts]{.mark}]{.underline}
in the United States, if it did have the capability and decided to use
it, this would not reduce our ability to retaliate militarily.
[Blackouts **do not** produce **catastrophe** or **military
advantage**]{.underline}. A cyber-induced blackout would, however, put
the regime's survival at risk---in diplomatic parlance, this is called
poking a bear with a stick. In any event, [the notion of
**[cyber]{.mark} [catastrophe]{.mark}** is **[wildly
exaggerated]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [reflecting a **popular culture**
prone to **exaggerating risk** rather than **seriously assessing** an
opponent's **capability** and **intent**]{.underline}.
[No]{.underline}rth [Ko]{.underline}rea [uses cyber attacks to advance
its **policy agenda**]{.underline}; [**[no]{.mark}ne** of its
**[actions]{.mark}** has [been]{.mark} **[capricious]{.mark}** or
**haphazard**]{.underline}. Cyber attacks do not come out of the blue.
They are not random acts (and they are not launched by groups with funny
names) but are calculated to achieve either political or financial
goals. A decision to launch a cyber attack would be made by Kim Jong-un,
and he would consider this in the context of the larger efforts to
manipulate decisionmakers and public opinion in the United States,
Japan, and South Korea. An attack on critical infrastructure located in
the domestic United States would be extremely provocative, and there are
plenty of other provocative things the North can do that do not create
existential risk for the Kim regime. Kim and his advisers probably know
that China and Russia would look unfavorably on a cyber attack against
the United States at this tense juncture, and while the North may be
ready to ignore its patrons in some matters, starting an armed conflict
with the United States is not one of them. It is [commonplace to call
**[Kim]{.mark}**]{.underline} ~~crazy~~ \[[irrational]{.underline}\],
[but his [decisions]{.mark} are **[rational]{.mark}** in the context of
No]{.underline}rth [Ko]{.underline}rea['s **strategic
culture**]{.underline}. [An attack]{.underline} on the United States
[that the North believes is likely to]{.underline} be detected, that
will not produce significant harm, and that could [generate a **damaging
response** is **unattractive**]{.underline}. [The [goal]{.mark} is [to
**manipulate**]{.mark} the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates and
its North Asian allies **[[without]{.mark} provoking
[war]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [and [cyber attacks]{.mark} [on]{.mark} the
[U.S.]{.mark} **homeland**]{.underline}, catastrophic or otherwise,
[[run **counter**]{.mark} to this]{.underline}.

**[No]{.underline}**rth **[Ko]{.underline}**rea **[is in
trouble]{.underline}**. The COVID-19 [pandemic]{.underline},
self-imposed [isolation]{.underline} and [lockdowns]{.underline}, [crop
failures]{.underline}, [sanctions]{.underline}, and more have [put the
**economy** in a **parlous state**]{.underline}, a fact acknowledged by
Kim Jong Un himself. The state planning mechanism seems broken, foreign
exchange holdings are down, [**state revenue** is
**shrinking**]{.underline}, [foreign **trade** numbers have
**collapsed**]{.underline}, [and **growth** is
**declining**]{.underline}. The measures taken thus far by the regime to
deal with the crisis seem unlikely to turn things around. Indeed, they
may make matters worse, especially if Pyongyang follows through on plans
to divert scarce resources to expand its nuclear weapons and missile
programs.

Despite its difficulties, don't count Pyongyang out. For decades, the
North Korean regime has demonstrated remarkable determination,
diplomatic dexterity, and uncanny survival skills. And the DPRK has the
support of China, which is prepared to live with Pyongyang's nuclear
status and committed to keeping the regime on "life support." North
Korea is down, but hardly out.

In the midst of this economic crisis, [Kim]{.underline} Jong Un [is
gambling that expanding his nuclear and missile arsenals will convince
the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [to engage in]{.underline}
"**[arms control talks]{.underline}**" [that would]{.underline} tacitly
[accept the DPRK as a nuclear power and give Pyongyang]{.underline} the
**[sanctions]{.underline}** **[relief]{.underline}** it needs.

[But]{.underline} [No]{.underline}rth [Ko]{.underline}rea's [economic
crisis represents a **major vulnerability**]{.underline} for Pyongyang.
It [presents an opportunity to apply **overwhelming pressure** on the
regime across a broad front and **convince** Kim]{.underline} Jong Un
[that his **pursuit** of nuclear weapons could **end his
regime**]{.underline}. Previous efforts to do so were half-hearted and
failed to change Kim's calculus. The current crisis may be the last
opportunity to try.

Today, [prospects for]{.underline} [No]{.underline}rth
[Ko]{.underline}rea's [denuclearization are **all but
gone**]{.underline}. But [that goal may still be achievable if
the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, its allies,
[and partners recognize]{.underline} that [Kim]{.underline} Jong Un [and
his regime are standing on **shaky ground**]{.underline}, [and that now
is the time to convince Kim that the **trembling** he feels is a sign
that the **regime's days** could be **numbered**]{.underline}.

#### Otherwise, waiting causes Kim sells [nukes]{.underline} to [Iran]{.underline} and conducts [EMP attacks]{.underline} on the [grid]{.underline}.

Decades of failed talks, and the failed Hanoi nuclear summit proves
again, [[No]{.underline}]{.mark}rth [[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}rea [will
[not **denuclearize**]{.mark} **[peacefully]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Dictator [[Kim]{.underline}]{.mark} Jong-un's [[game]{.mark} [is to
**buy time**]{.mark}]{.underline} through pretend negotiations [[to
build]{.mark} enough [ICBMs]{.mark} [so]{.mark}
[nuclear]{.mark}-armed]{.underline} [[No]{.underline}]{.mark}rth
[[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}rea, [with a]{.underline} Mutual Assured
Destruction (**[MAD]{.underline}**) [**relationship** with
the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates,
[[becomes]{.mark} **[irreversible]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Economic [[sanctions]{.mark} designed to pressure No]{.underline}rth
[Ko]{.underline}rea's [denuclearization peacefully **[never
worked]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [and are **not working
now**]{.underline}. According to a recent United Nations report obtained
by the Associated Press, leaked in the UK Guardian (March 11, 2019):

"[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[N]{.underline}]{.mark}ations [experts
are [investigating]{.mark}]{.underline} possible
[**[violations]{.mark}** of UN sanctions on No]{.underline}rth
[Ko]{.underline}rea [in]{.underline} about **[20
countries]{.underline}**, [[from]{.mark} alleged **[clandestine nuclear
procurement]{.mark}** in **China** to **arms brokering** in **Syria**
and **military cooperation** with **Iran**]{.underline}, [**Libya** and
**Sudan**]{.underline}. The expert panel's 66-page report to the
security council also detailed the appearance in North Korea of a
Rolls-Royce Phantom, Mercedes-Benz limousines and Lexus LX 570
all-wheel-drives in violation of a ban on luxury goods. And it noted a
trend in North Korea's evasion of financial sanctions by using
cyberattacks to 'illegally force the transfer of funds from financial
institutions and cryptocurrency exchanges.'"

Moreover, according to the UN report: "[[No]{.underline}]{.mark}rth
[[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}rea's [nuclear and missile programs **remained
intact**]{.underline} and its [leaders [were dispersing **missile
assembly**]{.mark} and **testing [facilities]{.mark}** [to
prevent]{.mark}]{.underline} '**[[decapitation]{.underline}]{.mark}**'
**[[strikes]{.underline}]{.mark}**."

The White House should be alarmed [[No]{.underline}]{.mark}rth
[[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}rea [[is]{.mark} now [reneging on
**dismantlement** of their]{.mark} **Sohae [satellite]{.mark}** launch
facility]{.underline}, **[rebuilding]{.underline}** Sohae [to orbit
satellites]{.underline}, possibly [**[nuc]{.mark}lear-[armed]{.mark}**
[for **EMP attack**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The Congressional EMP Commission warns [two No]{.underline}rth
[Ko]{.underline}rean [[satellites]{.underline}]{.mark} presently [orbit
over the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates that,
[if nuclear-armed]{.underline}, [[could
**blackout**]{.underline}]{.mark} North [[America]{.underline}]{.mark}
--- posing potentially the single greatest nuclear threat from North
Korea.

The EMP Commission recommends shooting-down these satellites over
uninhabited regions. The United States has intercepted satellites
before, in the 1980s, and is significantly more capable of
anti-satellite operations today.

Destruction of North Korea's two satellites would be the least
escalatory military option, as it would not entail striking North
Korea's homeland, yet would eliminate the greatest potential nuclear
threat to the United States.

Downing North Korea's satellites alone, one of the smallest and most
easily executed military operations, might be enough to bring about a
diplomatic solution. For the first time the United States will be
striking against the North Korean nuclear threat --- proving to
Pyongyang, China, and Russia the United States is determined to
denuclearize North Korea, forcefully if necessary.

Another military option, more ambitious and riskier, would destroy North
Korea's: 2 satellites, 12-20 ICBMs, 30-50 IRBMs, 60 mostly non-nuclear
bombers, 1 Sinpo missile submarine, 12 retired Golf missile submarines
(purchased from Russia), the Sohae satellite launcher and Yongbyon
Nuclear Complex, including a nearby clandestine uranium enrichment
facility.

[**[Tunnels]{.mark}** can [become **graveyards** for]{.mark}
No]{.underline}rth [Ko]{.underline}rean [[missiles by bombing
entrances]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Nor]{.underline}th [Ko]{.underline}rean
[**[air defenses]{.mark}** are **antiquated**]{.underline},
[[ineffective]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[and can be
suppressed]{.underline}]{.mark} non-lethally [[with]{.mark} **electronic
[countermeasures]{.mark}**]{.underline}. **[[Aegis
cruisers]{.underline}]{.mark}** and other anti-missile defenses [[can be
surged to **intercept**]{.mark} any **[launched
missiles]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

All of this, fewer than 150 targets, could probably be destroyed by
three aircraft carriers and Global Strike forces using conventional
weapons in a few hours. Any surviving or future new ICBMs or IRBMs
should be destroyed on sight. [This [campaign would **eliminate** the
No]{.mark}]{.underline}rth [[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}rean [[nuclear
missile threat]{.underline}]{.mark} to North America and U.S.
territories and severely cripple their nuclear program. Another military
option, even more ambitious and even riskier, would do all the above and
destroy North Korea's almost entirely non-nuclear 300-450 MRBMs and
600-800 SRBMs. This would eliminate Pyongyang's nuclear threat to Japan
and South Korea, but would probably require days to execute and entail
much higher escalatory risks.

[[Striking **quickly**]{.underline}]{.mark}, surgically, against the
smallest number of targets, [[is **least likely** to be
**misconstrued**]{.mark} as attempting to destroy the No]{.underline}rth
[Ko]{.underline}rean [regime]{.underline} in an all-out war --- [and
therefore least likely to result in No]{.underline}rth
[Ko]{.underline}rean [escalation]{.underline} using nuclear or other
weapons of mass destruction.

~~Psychopaths~~ \[[[dictators]{.underline}]{.mark}\] [like
Kim]{.underline} Jong-un [[have been **attacked**]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[and **defeated**]{.underline}]{.mark},
**[[without]{.underline}]{.mark}** their
**[[using]{.underline}]{.mark}** weapons of mass destruction
(**[[WMDs]{.underline}]{.mark}**):

• Adolf [**[Hitler]{.mark}** during]{.underline} [W]{.underline}orld
[W]{.underline}ar [II refrained from using Tabun and Sarin nerve
gas]{.underline}, fearing Allied retaliation.

• Iraq's Saddam [**[Hussein]{.mark}** did not retaliate for Israel's
destruction of]{.underline} his [Osirik nuclear reactor]{.underline} in
1981, or launch chemical and biological missiles during wars with the
United States in 1991 and 2003.

• Syria's Bashar [**[Assad]{.mark}** did not retaliate for Israel's
destruction of]{.underline} his clandestine [Al Kibir nuclear
reactor]{.underline} in 2007, [or for U.S. destruction of]{.underline}
his [Barzah]{.underline} chemical-biological [weapons
complex]{.underline} in 2018.

Denuclearizing North Korea forcibly is very risky. The United States
should be prepared to respond to North Korean use of WMDs --- including
with nuclear strikes to destroy the regime, if necessary.

But "**[[living]{.underline}]{.mark}**" [[**with**
**nuclear**]{.underline}]{.mark}-[[**armed** No]{.underline}]{.mark}rth
[[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}rea, surrendering to Mutual Assured Destruction
with Kim Jong-un, [is **reckless** and **[will]{.mark}** **surely [kill
millions]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[[If No]{.underline}]{.mark}rth [[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}rea **[[defies
denuclearization]{.underline}]{.mark}** successfully, **[[nuclear-armed
Iran is next]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Tehran on March 18 announced Russia
will build them two more nuclear reactors.

#### Iran prolif causes [extinction]{.underline}. 

**Futter '21** \[Andrew; School of History, Politics and International
Relations @ University of Leicester; *The Politics of Nuclear Weapons*;

We can think of five possible negative implications of the Iranian quest
for a bomb. The first is that [a **[nuclear]{.mark}-armed
[Iran]{.mark}**]{.underline} [could [cause **other
nations**]{.mark}]{.underline} [in the region [to develop]{.mark} their
own **nuclear weapons capability**]{.underline} (primarily for security
purposes, but also for regional prestige). The most likely candidates
for this would be **[[Saudi Arabia]{.underline}]{.mark}** and the Gulf
**[[Emirates]{.underline}]{.mark}** but might also include
**[[Turkey]{.underline}]{.mark}** and **[[Egypt]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
The second is the possibility that [if Iran is able to acquire **nuclear
weapons**]{.underline}, [it [will]{.mark} **fundamentally
[undermine]{.mark}**]{.underline} [the **international**]{.underline}
nuclear **[[non-proliferation regime]{.underline}]{.mark}** [and provide
a **[green light]{.mark}**]{.underline} [to [others]{.mark} thinking of
developing nuclear weapons. It may]{.underline} also
[[present]{.underline}]{.mark} a signal, perhaps even [**[existential
crisis]{.underline}**, [for]{.underline}]{.mark} [the]{.underline}
**[[N]{.underline}]{.mark}**on-**[[P]{.underline}]{.mark}**roliferation
**[[T]{.underline}]{.mark}**reaty (see Chap. 8). Third, [an
**[emboldened Iran]{.mark}**]{.underline} [could [lead to]{.mark}
**regional [instability]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This is because [there
are fears that a nuclear-armed Iran would be]{.underline} **[much
bolder]{.underline}** [and **more active**]{.underline} [[in the
**Middle East**]{.underline}]{.mark} region, [acting to
**destabilise**]{.underline} [and **undermine**]{.underline} [its
adversaries]{.underline}. A **[nuclear Iran]{.underline}**
[would]{.underline} also likely [make]{.underline} any [outside efforts
to address instability]{.underline} more [difficult]{.underline}.
Fourth, is the [impact on the threat felt by **Israel**]{.underline}.
[Iran has previously threatened Israel]{.underline}; in 2005 President
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was quoted as saying that Israel should be "wiped of
the map",71 and [a nucleararmed Iran]{.underline}
[[would]{.underline}]{.mark} therefore [**[not be
tolerable]{.underline}** [in **Tel Aviv**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
**[Heightened [tension]{.mark}]{.underline}** [between the two
[seems]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[likely]{.underline}**]{.mark}, [and a
**[direct]{.mark} military [confrontation]{.mark}**]{.underline} [cannot
be discounted]{.underline}. As Eric Edelman et al. explain: "The
greatest concern in the near term would be that [an **unstable
[Iranian-Israeli nuclear contest]{.mark}**]{.underline} [would [emerge,
with]{.mark}]{.underline} a **[significant [risk]{.mark}]{.underline}**
that [[either side would]{.mark} launch a **[first
strike]{.mark}**]{.underline} [on the other]{.underline} despite the
enormous risks and costs involved."72 Fifth, is the [possible link with
**terrorism**]{.underline} and the concern that [a **nuclear-armed
[Iran]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[could]{.underline}]{.mark} potentially
[**[supply terrorists]{.underline}** [with]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[nuclear material]{.underline}** [or even a **nuclear
[bomb]{.mark}**]{.underline}, perhaps [[through]{.underline}]{.mark} its
proxy **[[Hezbollah]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This is the subject of much
debate, and on balance it is probably unlikely that Iran would give
Hezbollah a bomb (for more on this see Chap. 9).

[Modern [civilization **cannot exist**]{.mark}]{.underline} for a
protracted period [[without electricity]{.mark}. [Within days of a
blackout across the U.S., a blackout]{.mark}]{.underline} that
[[could]{.underline} **[encompass the entire
planet]{.underline}**]{.mark}, [emergency generators would run out of
fuel, telecommunications would cease as would transportation due to
**gridlock**, and eventually **no fuel**]{.underline}. [Cities would
have no]{.underline} running [water and soon]{.underline}, within a few
days, [exhaust their food supplies]{.underline}. Police, Fire, Emergency
Services and **[hospitals cannot]{.underline}** long **[operate in a
blackout]{.underline}**. **[Government and
[Industry]{.mark}]{.underline}** [also [need
electricity]{.mark}]{.underline} in order to operate. The EMP Commission
warns that [a]{.underline} natural or nuclear EMP [event]{.underline},
[given]{.underline} current **[[unpreparedness]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
[would]{.underline} likely [[result in]{.mark} **[societal
collapse]{.mark}**. Terrorists, criminals, and even lone individuals can
build a non-nuclear EMP weapon without great trouble or
expense]{.underline}, working from Unclassified designs publicly
available on the internet, and [using parts available at any electronics
store]{.underline}. In 2000, the Terrorism Panel of the House Armed
Services Committee sponsored an experiment, recruiting a small team of
amateur electronics enthusiasts to attempt constructing a radiofrequency
weapon, relying only on unclassified design information and parts
purchased from Radio Shack. The team, in 1 year, built two
radiofrequency weapons of radically different designs. One was designed
to fit inside the shipping crate for a Xerox machine, so it could be
delivered to the Pentagon mail room where (in those more unguarded days
before 9/11) it could slowly fry the Pentagon's computers. The other
radiofrequency weapon was designed to fit inside a small Volkswagon bus,
so it could be driven down Wall Street and disrupt computers--- and
perhaps the National economy. Both designs were demonstrated and tested
successfully during a special Congressional hearing for this purpose at
the U.S. Army's Aberdeen Proving Ground. Radiofrequency weapons are not
merely a hypothetical threat. Terrorists, criminals, and disgruntled
individuals have used home-made radiofrequency weapons. The U.S.
military and foreign militaries have a wide variety of such weaponry.
Moreover, non-nuclear EMP devices that could be used as radiofrequency
weapons are publicly marketed for sale to anyone, usually advertised as
''EMP simulators.'' For example, one such simulator is advertised for
public sale as an ''EMP Suitcase.'' This EMP simulator is designed to
look like a suitcase, can be carried and operated by one person, and is
purpose-built with a high energy radiofrequency output to destroy
electronics. However, it has only a short radius of effect. Nonetheless,
a terrorist or deranged individual who knows what he is doing, who has
studied the electric grid for a major metropolitan area, could---armed
with the ''EMP Suitcase''--- black out a major city. A CLEAR AND PRESENT
DANGER. An EMP weapon can be used by state actors who wish to level the
battlefield by neutralizing the great technological advantage enjoyed by
U.S. military forces. EMP is also the ideal means, the only means,
whereby rogue states or terrorists could use a single nuclear weapon to
destroy the United States and prevail in the War on Terrorism or some
other conflict with a single blow. The EMP Commission also warned that
states or terrorists could exploit U.S. vulnerability to EMP attack for
coercion or blackmail: ''Therefore, terrorists or state actors that
possess relatively unsophisticated missiles armed with nuclear weapons
may well calculate that, instead of destroying a city or military base,
they may obtain the greatest political-military utility from one or a
few such weapons by using them---or threatening their use---in an EMP
attack.'' [The EMP Commission found that states such as Russia, China,
North Korea, and Iran have incorporated EMP attack into their military
doctrines, and openly describe making EMP attacks against the United
States]{.underline}. Indeed, the EMP Commission was established by
Congress partly in response to a Russian nuclear EMP threat made to an
official Congressional Delegation on May 2, 1999, in the midst of the
Balkans crisis. Vladimir Lukin, head of the Russian delegation and a
former Ambassador to the United States, warned: ''Hypothetically, if
Russia really wanted to hurt the United States in retaliation for NATO's
bombing of Yugoslavia, Russia could fire an SLBM and detonate a single
nuclear warhead at high altitude over the United States. The resulting
EMP would massively disrupt U.S. communications and computer systems,
shutting down everything.'' [China's military doctrine also openly
describes EMP attack as the ultimate asymmetric weapon, as it strikes at
the very technology that is the basis of U.S. power]{.underline}. Where
EMP is concerned, ''[The United States is more vulnerable to attacks
than any other country in the world'']{.underline}: ''Some people might
think that things similar to the 'Pearl Harbor Incident' are unlikely to
take place during the information age. Yet it could be regarded as the
'Pearl Harbor Incident' of the 21st Century if a surprise attack is
conducted against the enemy's crucial information systems of command,
control, and communications by such means as... electromagnetic pulse
weapons... [Even a superpower like the United States, which possesses
nuclear missiles and powerful armed forces, cannot guarantee its
immunity...In their own words, a highly computerized open society like
the United States is extremely vulnerable to electronic attacks from all
sides.]{.underline} This is because the U.S. economy, from banks to
telephone systems and from power plants to iron and steel works, relies
entirely on computer networks... When a country grows increasingly
powerful economically and technologically...it will become increasingly
dependent on modern information systems... The United States is more
vulnerable to attacks than any other country in the world.'' Iran---the
world's leading sponsor of international terrorism---in military
writings openly describes EMP as a terrorist weapon, and as the ultimate
weapon for prevailing over the West: ''If the world's industrial
countries fail to devise effective ways to defend themselves against
dangerous electronic assaults, then they will disintegrate within a few
years... American soldiers would not be able to find food to eat nor
would they be able to fire a single shot.'' The threats are not merely
words. The EMP Commission assesses that Russia has, as it openly
declares in military writings, probably developed what Russia describes
as a ''Super-EMP'' nuclear weapon---specifically designed to generate
extraordinarily high EMP fields in order to paralyze even the best
protected U.S. strategic and military forces. China probably also has
Super-EMP weapons. North Korea too may possess or be developing a
Super-EMP nuclear weapon, as alleged by credible Russian sources to the
EMP Commission, and by open-source reporting from South Korean military
intelligence. But any nuclear weapon, even a low-yield first generation
device, could suffice to make a catastrophic EMP attack on the United
States. Iran, although it is assessed as not yet having the bomb, is
actively testing missile delivery systems and has practiced launches of
its best missile, the Shahab--III, fuzing for high- altitude
detonations, in exercises that look suspiciously like training for
making EMP attacks. As noted earlier, Iran has also practiced launching
from a ship a Scud, the world's most common missile---possessed by over
60 nations, terrorist groups, and private collectors. A Scud might be
the ideal choice for a ship-launched EMP attack against the United
States intended to be executed anonymously, to escape any last-gasp U.S.
retaliation. Unlike a nuclear weapon detonated in a city, a
high-altitude EMP attack leaves no bomb debris for forensic analysis, no
perpetrator ''fingerprints.'' Under present levels of preparedness,
communications would be severely limited, restricted mainly to those few
military communications networks that are hardened against EMP. Today's
microelectronics are the foundation of our modern civilization, but are
over 1 million times more vulnerable to EMP than the far more primitive
and robust electronics of the 1960s, that proved vulnerable during
nuclear EMP tests of that era. Tests conducted by the EMP Commission
confirmed empirically the theory that, as modern microelectronics become
ever smaller and more efficient, and operate ever faster on lower
voltages, they also become ever more vulnerable, and can be destroyed or
disrupted by much lower EMP field strengths. Microelectronics and
electronic systems are everywhere, and run virtually everything in the
modern world. All of the civilian critical infrastructures that sustain
the economy of the United States, and the lives of 310 million
Americans, depend, directly or indirectly, upon electricity and
electronic systems. Of special concern is the vulnerability to EMP of
the Extra-High-Voltage (EHV) transformers, that are indispensable to the
operation of the electric grid. EHV transformers drive electric current
over long distances, from the point of generation to consumers (from the
Niagara Falls hydroelectric facility to New York City, for example). The
electric grid cannot operate without EHV transformers---which could be
destroyed by an EMP event. The United States no longer manufactures EHV
transformers. They must be manufactured and imported from overseas, from
Germany or South Korea, the only two nations in the world that
manufacture such transformers for export. Each EHV transformer must be
custom-made for its unique role in the grid. A single EHV transformer
typically requires 18 months to manufacture. The loss of large numbers
of EHV transformers to an EMP event would plunge the United States into
a protracted blackout lasting years, with perhaps no hope of eventual
recovery, as the society and population probably could not survive for
even 1 year without electricity. Another key vulnerability to EMP are
Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition systems (SCADAs). SCADAs
essentially are small computers, numbering in the millions and
ubiquitous everywhere in the critical infrastructures, that perform jobs
previously performed by hundreds of thousands of human technicians
during the 1960s and before, in the era prior to the microelectronics
revolution. SCADAs do things like regulating the flow of electricity
into a transformer, controlling the flow of gas through a pipeline, or
running traffic control lights. SCADAs enable a few dozen people to run
the critical infrastructures for an entire city, whereas previously
hundreds or even thousands of technicians were necessary. Unfortunately,
SCADAs are especially vulnerable to EMP. EHV transformers and SCADAs are
the most important vulnerabilities to EMP, but are by no means the only
vulnerabilities. Each of the critical infrastructures has their own
unique vulnerabilities to EMP: The National electric grid, with its
transformers and generators and electronic controls and thousands of
miles of power lines, is a vast electronic machine---more vulnerable to
EMP than any other critical infrastructure. Yet [[the]{.mark} electric
[grid is]{.mark} the **most important of all critical
infrastructures**]{.underline}, [and is in fact [the **keystone
supporting modern civilization**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [as it powers
**all the other critical infrastructures**]{.underline}. [As of now [it
is our **technological Achilles Heel**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The EMP
Commission found that, [if the electric grid collapses, so too will
collapse **all the other critical infrastructures**]{.underline}. But,
if the electric grid can be protected and recovered, so too all the
other critical infrastructures can also be restored.
**[Transportation]{.underline}** is a critical infrastructure because
modern [civilization cannot exist without the goods and services moved
by road, rail, ship, and air]{.underline}. Cars, trucks, locomotives,
ships, and aircraft all have electronic components, motors, and controls
that are potentially vulnerable to EMP. Gas stations, fuel pipelines,
and refineries that make petroleum products depend upon electronic
components and cannot operate without electricity. Given our current
state of unpreparedness, in the aftermath of a natural or nuclear EMP
event, transportation systems would be ~~paralyzed~~. **[Traffic control
systems]{.underline}** that avert traffic jams and collisions for road,
rail, and air depend upon electronic systems, that the EMP Commission
discovered are especially vulnerable to EMP.
**[Communications]{.underline}** is a critical infrastructure because
modern economies and [the cohesion and [operation of modern societies
depend]{.mark} to a degree unprecedented in history [on]{.mark} the
[rapid movement of information]{.mark}]{.underline}---accomplished today
mostly by electronic means. Telephones, cell phones, personal computers,
television, and radio are all directly vulnerable to EMP, and cannot
operate without electricity. Satellites that operate at Low-Earth-Orbit
(LEO) for communications, weather, scientific, and military purposes are
vulnerable to EMP and to collateral effects from an EMP attack. Within
weeks of an EMP event, the LEO satellites, which comprise most
satellites, would probably be inoperable. **[Banking and
finance]{.underline}** [are the critical infrastructure that sustain
modern economies.]{.underline} Whether it is the stock market, the
financial records of a multinational corporation, or the ATM card of an
individual---financial transactions and record keeping all depend now at
the macro- and micro-level upon computers and electronic automated
systems. Many of these are directly vulnerable to EMP, and none can
operate [without electricity]{.underline}. The EMP Commission found that
[an]{.underline} EMP [event could transform the modern electronic
economy into a **feudal economy based on barter**. **Food**]{.underline}
[has always been]{.underline} **[vital to]{.underline}** every person
and **[every civilization]{.underline}**. [The critical infrastructure
for producing, delivering, and storing food depends upon a **complex web

[Modern technology **[enables over 98 percent of the U.S. National
population to be fed]{.mark}**]{.underline} by less than 2 percent of
the population. Huge regional warehouses that resupply supermarkets
constitute the National food reserves, enough food to feed the Nation
for 30--60 days at normal consumption rates, the warehoused food
preserved by refrigeration and temperature control systems that
typically have enough emergency electrical power (diesel or gas
generators) to last only about an average of 3 days. [Experience with
storm-induced blackouts proves that when these big regional food
warehouses lose electrical power, **most of the food supply will rapidly
spoil**.]{.underline} [Farmers]{.underline}, less than 2 percent of the
population as noted above, **[cannot feed 310 million
Americans]{.underline}** [if deprived of the means that currently makes
possible this technological miracle. Water too has always been a basic
necessity to every person and civilization, even more crucial than
food]{.underline}. [The critical [infrastructure for purifying and
delivering]{.mark} potable [water]{.mark}, and for disposing of and
treating waste water, [is]{.mark} a vast networked machine [powered by
electricity]{.mark} that uses electrical pumps, screens, filters,
paddles, and sprayers to purify and deliver drinkable water, and to
remove and treat waste water]{.underline}. Much of the machinery in the
water infrastructure is directly vulnerable to EMP. The system cannot
operate without vast amounts of electricity supplied by the power grid.
[[A]{.mark} natural or [nuclear EMP]{.mark} event [would]{.mark}
immediately [deprive]{.mark} most of [the U.S.]{.mark} National
population [of]{.mark} running [water]{.mark}]{.underline}. Many
[natural [sources]{.mark} of water]{.underline}---lakes, streams, and
rivers---[[would be dangerously polluted]{.mark} by toxic
wastes]{.underline} from sewage, industry, and hospitals that would
backflow from or bypass wastewater treatment plants, that could no
longer intake and treat pollutants without electric power. Many natural
water sources that would normally be safe to drink, after an EMP event,
would be polluted with human wastes including feces, industrial wastes
including arsenic and heavy metals, and hospital wastes including
pathogens. Emergency services such as police, fire, and hospitals are
the critical infrastructure that upholds the most basic functions of
government and society---preserving law and order, protecting property
and life. Experience from protracted storm-induced blackouts has shown,
for example in the aftermath of Hurricanes Andrew and Katrina, that when
the lights go out and communications systems fail and there is no gas
for squad cars, fire trucks, and ambulances, [[the worst
elements]{.mark} of society and the worst human instincts **rapidly
[takeover]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The EMP Commission found that, [given
our current]{.underline} state of [unpreparedness]{.underline}, a
natural or nuclear EMP event [could [create **anarchic

Denuclearization Is Still an Option

Fourth, Cha contends that at this Party Congress, Kim Jong Un made it
clear that he does not intend to negotiate on denuclearization with the
Biden administration. However, such an argument is based on a priori
assumptions, not observation or analysis of what actually transpired at
the Congress. At the eight-day-long Congress, Kim neither mentioned
denuclearization nor stated that he has no intention to denuclearize.

Before this Congress, the DPRK government has repeatedly announced that
it will persist in developing strategic weapons until the United States
withdraws its hostile policy towards North Korea. The DPRK's position on
denuclearization has always been conditional. Therefore, the plan for
developing strategic weapons announced at this Congress cannot be
interpreted as a final statement that North Korea does not have a
willingness to denuclearize.

Recent moves by North Korea show that although it will not approach the
United States with flexibility first, it has a willingness to negotiate
on denuclearization with the Biden administration. During this
transition period of American leadership, North Korea has not made any
provocations against the United States in rhetoric or action from the
election to the present. This is contrary to the past when North Korea
made provocations to test the United States whenever a new US
administration was about to start its term, including the time before
and after President Obama's inauguration. Additionally, the military
parade commemorating the Party Congress, held shortly before President
Biden's inauguration, did not display any ICBM (intercontinental
ballistic missile) that always appeared to provoke the United States in
previous military parades.

What do these signs point to? It is fair to interpret that if the United
States does not provoke North Korea first, it will likewise not provoke
the United States and that the government in Pyongyang is leaving room
open for nuclear negotiations with the Biden administration. At the
recent Party Congress, Kim Jong Un reaffirmed that the future
relationship between North Korea and the United States would depend on
changes in the United States' position. Contrary to Cha's argument that
North Korea does not intend to denuclearize, the North is sending a
message that it will wait for the United States to take a new approach.

HBisevac)

In an op-ed in the Washington Post on January 15, 2021, Dr. Victor Cha,
a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies,
warned that the United States may confront a military crisis arising
from North Korea's regime instability or its collapse. He argued that
the North Korean economy could not survive "for another year or longer"
due to existing sanctions and border blockades for quarantine measures,
and thus the North Korean government may be tempted to take military
actions against external enemies, or it may lose control of its nuclear
weapons.

Cha is one of the most influential North Korea analysts in Washington;
unfortunately, in this case, his argument is closer to fiction than
reality. The inaccuracies and distorted description of North Korea's
situation themselves create risks. Such a view not only makes it more
difficult to solve the North Korean nuclear problem, but also might even
lead to policy miscalculations, such as a military option. In this
article, we rebut Cha's claim in hopes of providing a more accurate
basis for considering diplomatic and policy options.

Flawed Economic Analysis

First, [there is almost **[no possibility]{.mark}** that [the]{.mark}
[No]{.mark}]{.underline}rth [[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}rean
[**[econ]{.mark}omy** will **[collapse]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Cha
argues that the recent North Korean economy is in a situation
"comparable to the Great Famine in the 1990s." However, the reality is
entirely different from his assertion. North Korea experienced a
terrible crisis in the years after the end of the Cold War, during which
about two million people starved to death despite foreign aid. There
were no strong sanctions and a border blockade at that time, but there
was mass starvation. On the contrary, recently, [[starvation]{.mark} is
**[not pervasive]{.mark}** in]{.underline} [No]{.underline}rth
[Ko]{.underline}rea [even with]{.underline} tough [economic sanctions
and border blockades]{.underline} as far as we know.

Why does this difference exist? The reason is that
[[No]{.underline}]{.mark}rth [[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}rea [has already
[developed **internal conditions**]{.mark} [for]{.mark}
**[survival]{.mark}** with which it can manage to **muddle** **through
strong sanctions**]{.underline}. Since the early 2010s, the
[government]{.underline} in Pyongyang [has [pursued]{.mark} an [economic
policy]{.mark} of reform and openness [to]{.mark}
**[strengthen]{.mark}** its **[survival]{.mark} [capacity]{.mark}** and
**resilience**]{.underline}. In 2018, [its national strategy [shifted
from]{.mark} a [military-first]{.mark} [approach]{.mark} [to]{.mark} an
**[economy]{.mark}-[first]{.mark} one**]{.underline}. New economic
changes in North Korea [encompass a wide range of areas such as
facilitating **import substitution** and **domestic
production**]{.underline}, [adopting **competitive
systems**]{.underline}, **[expanding markets]{.underline}**, [reforming
financial institutions]{.underline}, [establishing **commercial
banks**]{.underline}, [and **promoting**]{.underline}
**[s]{.underline}**cience **[and]{.underline}**
**[t]{.underline}**echnology. However, the opening-up policy has been
postponed because of strong economic sanctions caused by North Korea's
nuclear program.

In particular, the [adoption of both]{.underline} the "[socialist
corporate responsible management system]{.underline}" [and]{.underline}
"[field responsibility system]{.underline}" [has **increased
production** and **facilitated distribution**]{.underline} in light
industry and agriculture. The former grants firms substantive management
rights to run business autonomously, and the latter permits individual
farmers to be rewarded for their crop yields. [As a result of an
**import substitution** policy]{.underline}, the [proportion of
domestically manufactured products has **rapidly increased** in
markets]{.underline}.

Also, [**exchange [rates]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} **market
[prices]{.mark}**]{.underline} for items such as rice and gasoline [have
[become]{.mark} relatively **[stable]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[No]{.underline}rth [Ko]{.underline}rea has [secured internal economic
conditions that enable people to have **at least three**]{.underline}
modest **[meals a day]{.underline}**. [Comparing]{.underline} the
[current]{.underline} North Korean [economy to the **Arduous
March**]{.underline} in the mid-to-late-1990s [is a **deeply flawed
approach** that considers **only** the **magnitude** of
challenges]{.underline} facing North Korea, [ignoring its **enhanced
ability** to ***cope*** with them]{.underline}.

Of course, the decline in trade and investment due to sanctions and
border blockades poses a major obstacle to North Korea's economic
development. However, North Korea has already secured an internal
economic foundation, thanks to which citizens do not starve to death
amid intensified sanctions. At the Eighth Congress of the Korean
Workers' Party last month, General Secretary Kim Jong Un admitted that
the five-year economic development strategy had fallen short of meeting
its goals in almost every category, but this should not be construed as
a complete failure of North Korean economy. Besides, the economic
recession caused by COVID-19 is a global phenomenon, not just for North
Korea.

Under the sanctions regime, it will be difficult for [No]{.underline}rth
[Ko]{.underline}rea to achieve economic prosperity through its
self-reliance strategy, but it [will have no problem in
maintaining]{.underline} the [s]{.underline}tatus [quo]{.underline} [or
achieving]{.underline} a low level of **[gradual economic
development]{.underline}**.\[1\]

Conquering COVID-19

Second, [Cha argues]{.underline} that [No]{.underline}rth
[Ko]{.underline}rea [will not be able to obtain a vaccine for
COVID]{.underline}-19 in the near future; [thus]{.underline}, [it
will]{.underline} have no choice but to [continuously block]{.underline}
its [borders and]{.underline}, [as a result]{.underline}, the [economy
will not be able to survive]{.underline} for a year or
[longer]{.underline}. However, his [claim is **groundless
speculation**]{.underline}. We find it [hard to agree with the argument
that **[China]{.mark}** will **not [provide]{.mark}** its **close ally**
with vaccines]{.underline}, [especially since it has **already supplied
them** to **Southeast Asian** and **African countries**]{.underline}.
According to our research, the [[No]{.underline}]{.mark}rth
[[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}rean government [has already secured **hundreds
of thousands** of [vaccine doses]{.mark} from China]{.underline}. Given
that the North Korean government desperately wants the revitalization of
foreign trade that is not subject to sanctions, [it is **[highly
likely]{.mark}** [to vaccinate]{.mark} **trade [workers
first]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Depending on whether the COVID-19 situation improves, trade between
North Korea and China is expected to resume as early as this spring or
in the fall at the latest. Therefore, the [No]{.underline}rth
[Ko]{.underline}rean [economy]{.underline} is [predicted to gradually
turn to a **recovery path**]{.underline} after hitting a low point in
2020 and the first half of 2021, when it faced a triple whammy of
sanctions, natural disasters and the coronavirus pandemic.

At the recent Party Congress, 7,000 people attended meetings without
wearing masks for the main events.\[2\] This suggests that North Korea
is in control of COVID-19, or there is at least no massive infection.
[Although a combination of [COVID]{.mark}]{.underline}-19 [[and
sanctions]{.mark} negatively impacts]{.underline} the
[No]{.underline}rth [Ko]{.underline}rean [economy]{.underline}, **[it is
[improbable]{.mark} [to lead to econ]{.mark}omic
[collapse]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

The Market Rules

Third, although Dr. Cha contends that via this Party Congress, North
Korea hinted at pursuing anti-market policies to overcome economic
difficulties, the government is unlikely to do so. If anything, [Cha's
argument]{.underline} seems to be [based on a **lack of understanding**
of the changes in economic policies in the **Kim**]{.underline} Jong Un
**[era]{.underline}**.

In the past, North Korean markets existed outside the national economy
and were spontaneously expanded by people seeking their own survival.
But [in the Kim]{.underline} Jong Un [era]{.underline}, [markets have
become part of the **structure** of the **national
economy**]{.underline}. In other words, the markets belong to the
economic arena managed by the government. In fact, [[Kim's]{.mark}
economic [policy]{.mark} **[enables]{.mark} factories**]{.underline},
[**enterprises** and **citizens** to [**utilize markets** for]{.mark}
[facilitating]{.mark} the **[supply]{.mark}** [and
**distribution**]{.mark} of products]{.underline}.

As economic reforms have expanded and been institutionalized since Kim's
ascension to power, the [government has not pursued a policy of
suppressing market activity]{.underline}. Therefore, [it is **highly
unlikely** that the government would transform its economic policy in
the direction of **cracking down** **on** or trying to **eliminate**
markets]{.underline}, unless serious abnormal symptoms spring up. The
failed currency reform in 2009 makes the government in Pyongyang likely
to refrain from undertaking an anti-market policy.

**[unbalanced]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}

Closer to the mainstream of Western strategic discourse, various experts
have argued that [[despite]{.mark} the **[risks]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[of proliferation, nuclear weapons, and the **[deterrent]{.mark}** they
provide]{.underline} should get (more) credit for
**[[contribut]{.underline}]{.mark}**ing, in combination with other

Peace']{.underline}]{.mark}** [among the great powers since
1945]{.underline} (Gaddis, 1999, p. 268--271; Gavin, 2012a, p. 164;
Acton 2010, pp. 16--17). Still others have contended that
[[because]{.mark} nuclear **[prolif]{.mark}**eration [is]{.mark} such a
**[rare]{.mark}** phenomenon, [and]{.mark} since **[robust]{.mark}
nonprolif**]{.underline}eration [[measures]{.mark} **tend** to

[and, therefore,]{.underline} **[manageable]{.underline}** (Mueller
2010, pp. 95--99; Hymans 2013, pp. 293--296).

The question of whether nuclear proliferation has stabilising or
destabilising effects is not just fascinating for scholars of the
nuclear age, but also highly consequential for practical policy issues.
For in order to debate the merits of particular policy choices -- such
as preventive military strikes against nuclear facilities, grand
bargains with potential proliferators or complete nuclear disarmament --
we need to understand first how the spread of nuclear weapons impacts
regional and global security.

The chapter proceeds in three steps. The first section provides the
foundation for the other parts by summarising what we know about
empirical patterns of proliferation and the utility of nuclear weapons
for statecraft. The second section then engages the literature on the
consequences of proliferation, focusing in particular on how
proliferation has influenced international stability. The final section
explores whether some states have been more affected than others, and
what measures these states have taken to prevent proliferation, or at
least mitigate its negative consequences.

Patterns of nuclear proliferation and the utility of nuclear weapons

Nuclear proliferation is commonly defined as the spread of nuclear
weapons to states that did not previously have them. Within a broader
conceptual framework that is rarely used by scholars, yet popular in the
arms control community, this diffusion of nuclear weapons to additional
states is labelled horizontal proliferation. It is conceptually
accompanied by the notion of vertical proliferation, which refers to
qualitative improvements and increases in the number of nuclear weapons
in the stockpiles of existing nuclear weapon states. In accordance with
the typical usage of the term in the scholarly debate, this chapter
focuses only on how the horizontal proliferation of nuclear weapons
affects international stability.

One important empirical pattern that has shaped how nuclear
proliferation is understood concerns the way in which nuclear weapons
have spread. [The word]{.underline} **[['spread']{.underline}]{.mark}**
[appears to [suggest]{.mark} that the **established**]{.underline}
nuclear [[powers]{.mark} have]{.underline}
[**[provide]{.mark}**d]{.underline} [other interested nations with (at
least a few) operational nuclear [warheads.]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[[Yet]{.mark} such transfers have [never]{.mark} been
undertaken.]{.underline}** [Certainly, states that sought nuclear
weapons have often received]{.underline} significant
**[assistance]{.underline}** from other nations (Schofield, 2014;
Fuhrmann, 2012), [sometimes in the form of]{.underline} highly sensitive
**[tech]{.underline}**nologies (Kroenig, 2010).
[Nonetheless,]{.underline} since **[[all]{.underline}]{.mark}** these
transfers [[remained]{.underline}]{.mark} **[well
[below]{.mark}]{.underline}** [the]{.underline} **[[weapons]{.mark}
threshold]{.underline}**, nations seeking nuclear weapons always had to
build them indigenously. Hence, [in reality, the spread of nuclear
weapons has meant that merely the **ambition**]{.underline} [to possess
a nuclear arsenal has spread]{.underline} to additional states, each of
which then had to pursue that goal primarily through indigenous efforts.

[Importantly, since a state's national [efforts]{.mark} to turn
its]{.underline} **[desire]{.underline}** for nuclear weapons
[into]{.underline} **[reality]{.underline}** [naturally
[span]{.mark}]{.underline} several (and sometimes **[[many)
years]{.underline}]{.mark}**, nuclear **[prolif]{.underline}**eration
[must be conceived of as a]{.underline} **[process]{.underline}**, as
opposed to just a single step (Meyer, 1986). This point is reinforced by
the fact that **[[29]{.underline}]{.mark}** out **[[of
39]{.underline}]{.mark}** states [[that]{.mark} have]{.underline}
**[[embarked]{.underline}]{.mark}** [upon that path]{.underline} (Müller
and Schmidt, 2010, p. 157; Mikoyan, 2012; Santoro, 2017)
[h[ave]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[not acquired]{.mark} a]{.underline}**
nuclear **[arsenal]{.underline}**. Hence, a lot of nuclear proliferation
activity has been undertaken by nations that did not ultimately become
nuclear weapon states. Three patterns explain this situation.

First, [[owing]{.underline}]{.mark} not just [[to]{.mark}
the]{.underline} **[[tech]{.mark}nological]{.underline}**, but also the
[**[institutional]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[managerial
challenges]{.underline}**]{.mark} [of the task]{.underline}, some
[[nations]{.mark} simply **[failed]{.mark} in their
efforts**]{.underline} to build the bomb (Hymans, 2012;
Braut-Hegghammer, 2016). Second, a few countries have chosen a nuclear
'hedging' strategy, intentionally confining their efforts to developing
the technological capability to build an arsenal quickly while
refraining from exercising that option (Narang, 2016--17, p. 134).
Third, [[several]{.mark} states have **[undertake]{.mark}**n a '[nuclear
**reversal'**, **abandoning**]{.mark}]{.underline} [their]{.underline}
nuclear [weapons [activities]{.mark}]{.underline} before developing
nuclear explosive devices (Müller and Schmidt, 2010).

devoted to trying to acquire nuclear weapons," Vice President Dick
Cheney said on Meet the Press four days before the tanks rolled. "And we
believe he has, in fact, reconstituted nuclear weapons."49 It is unclear
who the vice president meant by "we," because no one in the US
government or security community thought that Iraq had "reconstituted"
nuclear weapons in March 2003.50 [[Erroneous beliefs regarding]{.mark}
other [weapons]{.mark} [of mass destruction]{.mark} were among the
[reasons for the war, but it was not the **kind of preventive
strike**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[on a nuclear program]{.mark} [foreseen
by **SNA theorists**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Iran was not the only rogue state to abandon its nuclear program without
a fight. [At times]{.underline} **[de-nuclearization]{.underline}**
[occurred]{.underline} **[by choice]{.underline}**, as with South Africa
and Libya, while at other times nonproliferation was thrust upon states,
as was the case with the inchoate Syrian program. Colonel Mu'ammar
Gadhafi's motivation for his decision to shut down his WMD programs has
been the subject of ferocious and heavily partisan debate. At issue is
the extent to which the war in Iraq affected his calculations: Was
Gadhafi concerned about being the next target of US
counterproliferation, or was his decision a reflection of a broader
effort to remove his government from the list of international pariahs?
Supporters of the Bush administration posit a direct connection between
the war and Gadhafi's sudden change of heart. Negotiations with him had
begun some years earlier under the Clinton administration, however,
leading a number of observers to conclude that Libya would have
abandoned its program regardless of what happened in Iraq.51 More recent
work on the issue suggests that fear of being next on the US target list
did affect Gadhafi's thinking and can at the very least account for the
timing of his offer to disarm.52 "Disarm" is probably not the right
word, however, since Libya had nowhere near the requisite state capacity
to build a bomb, and Gadhafi probably knew it. International Atomic
Energy Agency inspectors found centrifuges and other crucial materials
in their original packing crates, where they had apparently been for
years.53 Libya may have announced it would not be joining the nuclear
club following the invasion of Iraq, but that was likely a conclusion it
had reached some time before. For these purposes, it is sufficient to
note that Libya abandoned its program for the foreseeable future.
**[Diplomacy worked]{.underline}**, the nonproliferation regime held,
and the rogue-state list shrank by one member.54

While it cannot yet be said that the 2007 Israeli airstrikes on a
reactor construction site permanently removed the possibility of a
Syrian nuclear weapon, the program has not restarted since the attack.
Threeand-a-half years passed between those strikes and the current civil
war, during which Assad presumably had plenty of time to re-establish
his reactors, should he have desired to do so. Instead it appears that
his government abandoned its efforts, which had not progressed very far
anyway.55 American intelligence had never been confident about Syria's
desire to build nuclear weapons in the first place, in large part
because additional facilities required for such an effort were not under
construction.56

Overall, [[while prevention]{.underline}
**[occurred]{.underline}**]{.mark} [[in the second]{.mark} nuclear age,
[its]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[pace]{.underline}** [is]{.underline}

Nuclear Proliferation

In an influential book, Graham Allison argues that "no new nuclear
weapons states" should be a prime foreign policy principle, and analyst
Joseph Cirincione very much agrees, insisting that nonproliferation
should be "our number one national‐​security priority."5 [[There

this area, however. First, [the pace of nuclear [prolif]{.mark}eration
[has been]{.mark} **far [slow]{.mark}er** than has been **commonly
predicted** primarily because the [weapons convey **little
advantage**]{.mark} **to their possessor**]{.underline}. Second, [the
**consequences** of such [prolif]{.mark}eration that **[has]{.mark}
taken place** have [been]{.mark} **substantially
[benign]{.mark}**]{.underline}: [those who have acquired the weapons
have "used" them simply to **stoke their egos** or to
**deter**]{.underline} real or imagined **[threats]{.underline}**.6 And
thirdly, the costs of anti‐​proliferation policy have been very
substantial: the number of people who have died as a consequence of
dedicated efforts to contain nuclear proliferation runs well into six
figures. Pace Alarmists have been wrong for decades about the pace of
nuclear proliferation. [[**Dozens** of]{.mark} **technologically
[capable]{.mark}** [countries have **considered**]{.mark} obtaining
nuclear [arsenals, but **very few have done
so**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} Indeed, as Jacques Hymans has pointed
out, even supposedly optimistic forecasts about nuclear dispersion have
proved to be too pessimistic.7 Thus, in 1958, the National Planning
Association predicted "a rapid rise in the number of atomic powers ...
by the mid‐​1960s."8 A few years later, C. P. Snow sagely predicted,
"Within, at the most, six years, China and several other states \[will\]
have a stock of nuclear bombs," and John Kennedy observed that there
might be "ten, fifteen, twenty" countries with a nuclear capacity by
1964.9 As part of that forecasting, it has generally been assumed that
nuclear weapons would be important status --- or virility --- symbols;
therefore, all advanced countries would want to have them in order to
show how "powerful" they were. Thus, France's de Gaulle opined in the
1960s, "No country without an atom bomb could properly consider itself
independent," and Robert Gilpin concluded that "the possession of
nuclear weapons largely determines a nation's rank in the hierarchy of
international prestige."10 In Gilpinian tradition, some analysts who
describe themselves as "realists" have insisted for years that Germany
and Japan must soon come to their senses and quest after nuclear
weapons.11 [Such punditry has gone astray in part because the pundits
insist on **extrapolating** from the **wrong cases**]{.underline}. A
more pertinent prototype would have been [Canada]{.underline}, a country
that **[could]{.underline}** easily [have had nuclear weapons by the
1960s but **declined to make the effort**]{.underline}.12 In fact, over
the decades, [[a **huge number**]{.mark} **of countries** capable of
developing nuclear weapons have **[neglected even to consider the
opportunity]{.mark}** --- for example, Canada, Italy, and Norway ---
even as Argentina, Brazil, Libya, South Korea, and Taiwan have **backed
away from** or **reversed** nuclear weapons programs, and Belarus,
Kazakhstan, South Africa, and Ukraine have actually **surrendered** or
**dismantled** an **existing nuclear arsenal**]{.underline}.13 Some of
that reduction is no doubt due to the hostility of the nuclear nations,
but even without that, the Canadian case seems to have proved to have
rather general relevance. To begin with, as Stephen Meyer has shown,
[there is no "**technological imperative**" for countries to **obtain
nuclear weapons**]{.underline} once they have achieved the technical
capacity to do so.14 Moreover, like military prowess in general, [[the
weapons have **not proved**]{.mark} to be crucial [status
symbols]{.mark}]{.underline}. As Robert Jervis has observed, "India,
China, and Israel may have decreased the chance of direct attack by
developing nuclear weapons, but it is hard to argue that they have
increased their general prestige or influence."15 How much more status
would Japan have if it possessed nuclear weapons? [Would anybody pay a
**great deal more attention** to Britain or France if their arsenals
held 5,000 nuclear weapons, or would anybody pay **much less** if they
had **none**? Did **China** need nuclear weapons to impress the world
with its **economic growth?**]{.underline} Or with its Olympics? As
Jennifer Mackby and Walter Slocombe observe, "[Germany,
like]{.underline} its erstwhile Axis ally, [[Japan]{.underline}]{.mark},
[has become powerful because of its **economic might** rather than its
**military might**]{.underline}, [and its **[renunciation of
nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark}** may even have **[reinforced]{.mark}
its [prestige]{.mark}**]{.underline}."16 [**[Decades of]{.mark} alarmist
[predictions]{.mark}** [about]{.mark} proliferation **chains**,
**[cascades]{.mark}**, **dominoes**, **waves**, **avalanches**,
**epidemics**, and **points of no return** [have proved]{.mark} to be
**[faulty]{.mark}**. The [proli]{.mark}feration of nuclear weapons [has
been]{.mark} **far [slow]{.mark}er than routinely expected** because,
insofar as most **[leaders]{.mark} of most countries**]{.underline}
([even **rogue ones**]{.underline}) have [considered acquiring the
weapons, they have come to [appreciate]{.mark} **several
defects**]{.underline}: [the [weapons are **dangerous**]{.mark},
**distasteful**, [**costly**, and]{.mark} likely to **[rile the
neighbors]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Moreover, as Jacques Hymans has
demonstrated, [the [weapons have]{.mark} also [been]{.mark}
**[exceedingly difficult to obtain]{.mark}** for **administratively
dysfunctional countries** like **Iran**]{.underline}.17 Consequences
Although we have now suffered through two‐​thirds of a century during
which there has been great hysteria about the disasters inherent in
nuclear proliferation, [the consequences of the proliferation that
**has** occurred have been **substantially benign**]{.underline}. [The
few [countries]{.mark} to [which]{.mark} the weapons [have proliferated
have **quietly kept them in storage**]{.mark}]{.underline} [and haven't
even found much benefit in **rattling them** from time to
time]{.underline}. And [even the **deterrence value** of the weapons has
been **questionable**]{.underline} --- [the major Cold War
participants]{.underline}, for example, [scarcely needed visions of
mushroom clouds to conclude that any replication of World War
II]{.underline}, with or without nuclear weapons, [was a **decidedly bad
idea**]{.underline}.18 Moreover, [[there has **never** been a]{.mark}
**militarily [compelling]{.mark}**]{.underline} --- or even minimally
sensible --- **[[reason]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[to **use the
weapons**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [particularly because of an
**inability** to **identify suitable targets**]{.underline} or ones that
could not be attacked about as **[effectively]{.underline}** by
conventional munitions. And [it is difficult to see how nuclear weapons
**benefited their possessors** in specific military ventures.
Israel's]{.underline} presumed [nuclear weapons **did not restrain** the
Arabs from attacking in **1973**]{.underline}, nor did Britain's prevent
Argentina's seizure of the Falklands in 1982. Similarly, the tens of
thousands of nuclear weapons in the arsenals of the enveloping allied
forces did not cause Saddam Hussein to order his occupying forces out of
Kuwait in 1990. Nor did possession of the bomb benefit America in Korea,
Vietnam, Iraq, or Afghanistan; France in Algeria; or the Soviet Union in
Afghanistan.

LESS RELEVANT REGION In response to the Iraq war, the United States has
aimed to reduce its role in the Middle East. Three factors have made
that course both more alluring and more possible. First, [interstate
[conflicts that]{.mark} **directly [threaten]{.mark}ed** [U.S.]{.mark}
interests]{.underline} in the past [have **largely been
[replaced]{.mark}** [by **substate**]{.mark} **security
[threats]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Second, **[[other]{.mark} rising
[regions]{.mark}]{.underline}**, especially Asia, [have taken on [more
importance]{.mark}]{.underline} to U.S. global strategy. And third,
[**the [diversification of]{.mark} global [energy]{.mark} markets** has
[weakened oil]{.mark} as a driver]{.underline} of U.S. policy. [[During
the Cold War,]{.mark} traditional state]{.underline}-based [[threats
pushed]{.mark} the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [to play
**[a]{.mark} major [role]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the Middle East. That
role involved not only ensuring the stable supply of energy to Western
markets but also working to prevent the spread of communist influence
and tamping down the Arab-Israeli conflict so as to help stabilize
friendly states. These [[efforts]{.mark} were **largely
[successful]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Beginning in the 1970s, the United
States nudged Egypt out of the pro-Soviet camp, oversaw the first
Arab-Israeli peace treaty, and solidified its hegemony in the region.
[Despite challenges]{.underline} from Iran after its 1979 revolution and

Columnist, Former General Manager of Al Arabiya News Channel and Former
Editor-in-Chief of Asharq Al-Awsat, "The Specter of World War III?",
Arab News, 10/22/2016, http://www.arabnews.com/node/1000701/columns#

Deputy Prime Minister of Turkey Numan Kurtulmus recently warned against
the risks of disagreements over the battle of Mosul. He said that this
could even mark the beginning of World War III.

[Despite the sectarian and ethnic nature]{.underline} of the conflict,
[the battle of [Mosul is not likely to]{.mark} cause a third [world
war]{.mark}]{.underline}, **[not even a broad regional
war]{.underline}**. Similarly, the war in Aleppo, [Syria or Iraq **would
not turn into a broad war**]{.underline}. All that is being talked about
are mere incendiary talks. They have nothing to do with strategists,
planners and decision-makers who sit in air-conditioned rooms thousands
of miles away from our region in the United States or Russia.

[The [world is]{.mark} already [grappling with]{.mark} several
[conflicts and is **not likely** to witness any]{.mark} of these
[turning into]{.mark} as devastating as a **[world
war]{.mark}**]{.underline}. World War II took 60 million lives, mostly
from the West, and [a World War III would]{.underline} be atrocious
because it is estimated to [kill a billion people]{.underline}. It will
use the only weapon that can ensure "victory", i.e., nuclear and
chemical weapons.

The United States, Russia, Europe and other countries or regions of
vital influence will disappear. There will be no winner and the whole
world will go back to the Stone Age. The earth will no longer remain
inhabitable for humans. [This is why no direct wars have been engendered
by the escalation of international conflicts]{.underline}.

What was known as the Cold War between the US and the former Soviet
Union was nothing but proxy or indirect war. As many as 140,000 American
soldiers were killed in the Vietnam War. However, the US did not resort
to the use of nuclear weapons and withdrew after the defeat. There were
4,000 casualties in Iraq before the Americans withdrew.

The Soviet Union crumbled and Russia lost 14 countries that were part of
its empire. It even lost three-quarters of its land and half of its
population, and yet, the Soviets did not talk about a World War III.
They did not launch a single nuclear missile. Instead, they continue
with the old chess strategy in the struggle with their rivals to gain
back influence and regions.

[It is not impossible to imagine a lunatic leader [using
**nuc**]{.mark}lear weapon**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the future.
This scenario has haunted the world since the end of World War II. [Many
regulations and protocols have been put in place to avoid
this]{.underline} madness. [Even [if it happens, **the reason won't be
conflicts**]{.mark} **such as the one taking place [in]{.mark} Mosul,
Aleppo or other parts of [our region]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[[Super powers consider our wars]{.mark} as [**side conflicts** that do
**not** call for]{.mark} a suicidal war that would destroy their
countries.]{.underline} What is being circulated in the Arab and Iranian
media about [[World War III]{.underline}]{.mark}, and being attributed
to Russian president or Henry Kissinger, is all forged.

[What are the circumstances in which major countries would wage
a]{.underline} crazy [[global nuclear war]{.mark}? It [would **only**
happen when their security is **directly threatened**]{.mark} and is on
the verge of collapse. This]{.underline} scenario [is **[extremely
unlikely]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[We imagine]{.underline} that [the world is keen to ensure our security
and stability whereas its main concern is safeguarding against
terrorists and refugees]{.underline}. Some are only worried about our
oil wells, as they are their sources of energy. Our governments are
solely in charge of the region's war and peace.

[[**In contrast** to]{.underline}]{.mark} the 20th century and [[the
early]{.mark} years of the [21st century, the]{.mark}]{.underline}
[regional [crisis in the 2010s]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[developed]{.underline}]{.mark} at a time [[when]{.underline}]{.mark},
overall, [[the **role and leverage of major powers** external to the
Middle East, as]{.underline}]{.mark} either [active [meddlers or
security guarantors]{.mark}]{.underline} in the region, or both,
actually [**[declined]{.mark} rather than increased**. The
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [serves as the most evident
case in point]{.underline}: the "post-interventionist" US administration
has clearly become "tired of the Middle East", struggling and often
failing to keep pace with the dynamically changing situation and unable
to alter or decisively affect the course of events. [The same even more
strongly applies to the European powers]{.underline}. In terms of
activity and impact, **[regional actors]{.underline}** (Iran, Saudi
Arabia, Qatar, UAE and Turkey) increasingly [appeared to outplay
external powers and influence]{.underline}. For external powers,
however, that did not remove a number of risks and threats connected to,
or emanating from, the Middle East. The increase and diversification of
global energy supply and the latest crisis in energy prices made the
region less central to the global economy than it had been in the past.
At the same time, the fundamental socio-political, statehood and
security crisis in the Middle East brought with it new security concerns
and implications. They mostly stemmed from reinforced perceptions about
the long-term nature of regional instability, the continuing potential
for further destabilization, and the related consequences and
implications beyond the region, ranging from terrorist connections to
migration flows. These challenges affect external powers unevenly. For
instance, the role of the Iraq-Syria area as the main focal point for
global terrorism activity and magnet for transnational flows of violent
extremists in the mid-2010s poses a threat to everyone (but mostly to
the countries of the region itself, as well as to those in Europe and
Eurasia). In contrast, the avalanche of refugee and migrant flows from
the Middle East primarily targets Europe (rather than North America,
Eurasia, or other regions). Until recently, [[the
main]{.underline}]{.mark} type of [[response]{.mark} by key]{.underline}
(Western) [external powers to turbulent developments in the Middle
East]{.underline}, while not amounting to a hands-off approach, [[boils
down to **limited containment**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Examples range
from limited air strikes against "Islamic State" positions in Iraq and
Syria, carried out by the US-led coalition since 2014, to the 2013 deal
on Syria's chemical disarmament co-brokered by the United States and
Russia. Not surprisingly, this limited-containment approach has had
equally limited results for Syria, Iraq and the region -- as well as for
the West itself (as shown, e.g., by the persistent migrant flows and
accelerating terrorist attacks in Europe). [[Despite the]{.mark} growing
[centrality of the Middle East to global politics]{.mark} and
security]{.underline}, and its more direct impact on and ties to the
West, [[this **damage limitation** course]{.mark} taken by key external
actors [has not been]{.mark} very [different from]{.mark}]{.underline},
e.g., [[the approach]{.mark} taken [by the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates and its Western allies (and also by
[[Russia and China]{.mark}) [to]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[Afghanistan]{.underline}]{.mark} problem in recent years.

In most cases [[terrorist]{.mark} groups appear to have **largely
[opt]{.mark}ed** [for]{.mark} the **[simplest]{.mark} [pathway]{.mark}**
towards the **achievement** of their **goals** [and]{.mark} the
**[weapons]{.mark}** used **[tend to be
vernacular]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [**[functional]{.mark} devices**
drawing on **local** and **readily-available materials**, [rather than
**sophisticated**]{.mark}, "baroque"
**[tech]{.mark}nologies**]{.underline}. This is certainly the case with
IEDs, the history of which is characterised largely by incremental
innovations -- although nevertheless frequently effective ones -- with
many means of delivery recycled from the past.44 Complexity can
therefore be seen as important in the adoption of technology by
terrorists generally, but is perhaps particularly acute in the case of
CBW technology. Some CBW can be relatively simple: "chlorine-augmented,
vehicle-borne IEDs," as employed by Al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) from 2006 to
2007 are not sophisticated weapons.45 Attacks on chemical production
facilities, an apparent tactic of Serbian forces in the early to
mid-1990s,46 employed relatively simple technologies -- specifically
explosives -- with toxicity a secondary by-product. Direct contamination
of food,47 drink48 or healthcare products49 does not require
particularly sophisticated technology for the purposes of delivery --
although may require some considerable skill to culture and scale-up a
biological agent -- and has been a common approach in European CBW
incidents.50 Similarly, the contamination of water systems, something
familiar to Europe,51 can also be relatively easily attempted. However,
in most cases such methods of dissemination have generated results that
are far short of the "mass destruction" that CBW are associated with,
although this does not mean such a possibility can be ignored by those
working on public health preparedness. Although some relatively simple
approaches could cause significant harm, [[mass casualty attacks]{.mark}
still [require]{.mark} **considerable [expertise]{.mark}**, something
particularly **acute** in the **context** of **biological
weapons**]{.underline}.52 The most effective route to weaponising
biology is arguably through the process of aerosolising agents,
something recognised mid-way through the last century as opening up the
theoretical possibility of using biological weapons on a gigantic
scale.53 However, [[realising such]{.mark} **theoretical**
**[potential]{.mark}** is [difficult]{.mark} [and]{.mark} it [**took
states decades** to **develop**]{.mark} required for CBW]{.underline}.62
[more **predictable biological weapons**]{.underline},54 and [[even then
**such weapons**]{.mark} [were]{.mark} acutely [**vulnerable** to
**environmental factors**.]{.mark}]{.underline}55 [For non-state groups
such **complexity** has proven a **significant barrier** to **CBW
development**]{.underline}. By means of an example, one of the
best-resourced biological weapons programs, that of Aum Shinrikyo,
failed variously because the group acquired the wrong strain,
contaminated fermenters and were faced with insurmountable production
and dissemination difficulties.56 There are of course exceptions, such
as the 2001 anthrax Letter Attacks in the US. However, if one accepts
the conclusions of the FBI that this sophisticated attack with
aerosolised anthrax in the US postal system was perpetrated by a US
biodefence researcher, Dr Bruce Ivins,57 it is an exception that proves
the rule. [To circumvent the difficulties with
aerosolisation]{.underline}, arguably [one could use **human-tohuman**
transmissible **biological agents**]{.underline} as part of a suicide
bioterror operation. There are good reasons for concern over how crude
suicide bioterrorists could employ such a tactic. [However, [the]{.mark}
**use** of **highly contagious [agents]{.mark}** is also poorly
**[predictable]{.mark}** [and would]{.mark} have to **[deal]{.mark}**
[with **social factors**]{.mark}, such as the "**spatial contact
process** among **individuals**", which can spell "out the
**difference** between **large-scale epidemics** and **abortive
ones**".]{.underline} 58 The counter to this argument is the growing
access to data and the changing human geography of the life sciences.
Some 83% of European households reportedly are online, effectively
allowing access to what is a growing body of available data on CBW,
including so-called bioterrorist "recipes" and "blueprints" that are
available in both mainstream scientific as well as more subversive
literatures online. It is also clear that there is a changing human
geography in European life sciences (for peaceful purposes), with the
emergence of 30 DIY-bio groups located in Europe59 and some 80 European
teams in the international Genetically Engineered Machines (IGEM)
competition in 2016.60 This is compounded by reports that groups such as
Daesh have deliberately sought to recruit foreign fighters "including
some with degrees in physics, chemistry, and computer science, who
experts believe have the ability to manufacture lethal weapons from raw
substances". 61 Whilst it would be unwise to ignore such developments,
[there is a need for **caution** in looking at the **extent** to which
new **tech**nologies and **geographies** will **facilitate** the
**adoption** of **chemical** and **biological weapons**]{.underline} by
groups seeking to target European countries. First, [[data is not
**information**]{.mark}, and **information** is **not knowledge**, let
alone the **tacit knowledge** required for **CBW**]{.underline}.62 In
many cases a degree of determination and dedication will be required
merely to separate online fantasy from fact and identify operationally
useful information (of relevance to the European context) from nonsense
(or information pertinent to contexts other than Europe). Second, with
new technologies there is the potential for such tools to enable some,
but certainly not all, actors, and even then new technologies bring new
challenges. CRISPR, gene editing technology is currently seen as a
particular source of promise and peril, which purportedly enables "even
largely untrained people to manipulate the very essence of life". 63 As
much may be technically true, yet "untrained people" would nonetheless
require some guidance in identifying suitable areas of genetic
structures to manipulate. Moreover, [CRISPR would only get **aspiring
weaponeers** so **far**, with [the process of]{.mark}
**[culturing]{.mark}**, [**scaling-up** and **weaponisation**]{.mark}
still [requiring]{.mark} **considerable [attention]{.mark}**
[and]{.mark} **interdisciplinary [skills]{.mark}**,]{.underline}
typically generated through "large interdisciplinary teams of
scientists, engineers, and technicians", 64 [[in order to be

I disagree. At a stretch, [terrorists]{.underline} [taking]{.underline}
[advantage]{.underline} [of advances]{.underline} [in]{.underline}
[biology]{.underline} [might]{.underline} [be able]{.underline} [to

[not]{.underline} a [weapon]{.underline} [that could kill 30

[[contemplated]{.underline}]{.mark} [[using]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[bio]{.mark}logical agents]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} the

record shows that [biological [agents]{.mark}]{.underline}
[are]{.underline} **[[difficult]{.underline}]{.mark}** [to

[required]{.underline} to undertake even the most basic of bioterrorism

near- and medium-term future. Gates does a disservice to the global
health security community when he draws media and policy attention to
amateurs such as terrorists. Where biological weapons are concerned, the
focus should remain on national militaries and state-sponsored groups.
These are the entities that might have the capability, now or in the
near future, to develop dangerous biological weapons. The real threat is
that sophisticated biological weapons will be used by state actors---or
by financially, scientifically, and militarily well-resourced groups

However, there are some reasons to think that naturally occurring
[[pathogens]{.mark} are [**unlikely** to cause]{.mark} human
[extinction]{.mark}]{.underline}. Firstly, [Homo sapiens have been
around for **200,000 years**]{.underline} and the Homo genus for around
six million years [without being exterminated by an infectious disease,
which is evidence]{.underline} that **[the base rate of
extinction-[risk]{.mark} natural pathogens is
[low]{.mark}]{.underline}**.82 Indeed, past disease [[outbreaks]{.mark}
have [not]{.mark} **come [close]{.mark}**]{.underline} [to rendering
humans extinct]{.underline}. Although bodies were piled high in the
streets across Europe during the Black Death,83 human extinction was
never a serious possibility, and some [economists even
argue]{.underline} that it was [a boon for the]{.underline} European
[economy]{.underline}.84 Secondly, [infectious
[disease]{.mark}]{.underline} has [only [contributed to the extinction

[is **a type of rat** native **only to Christmas Island**]{.underline}.
Having said that, the context may be importantly different for modern

decreasing. On the one hand, due to globalisation, the world is more
interconnected making it easier for pathogens to spread. On the other
hand, [interconnectedness could]{.underline} also [**increase immunity**

**[spread]{.mark} to every corner** of the world]{.underline}.38

With the exception of HIV---which can now be managed as a chronic

are kept at highly secure government facilities in Atlanta and Koltsovo,
Russia.40 Plague is now so rare that when it breaks out in countries
like Madagascar, it makes global news---yet fewer than 600 deaths from
the disease were reported between 2010 and 2015. Studies have shown that
most of the fatalities from the 1918 flu were actually due to secondary
bacterial infections that today could be controlled by antibiotics,41
which were introduced less than a century ago. Influenza pandemics
remain the great fear of infectious disease experts, but the most recent
one in 2009 killed only about 284,000 people worldwide.42 That was fewer
than the number of people who die from seasonal flu in an ordinary
year.43

[Modern [science]{.mark} has [**defanged** most]{.mark} infectious

progress has been made there in recent years---but [**basic
[evolution]{.mark}** also plays a role in **[limit]{.mark}**ing the
[catastrophic potential]{.mark} of natural disease. Every pathogen faces
a **trade-off**. In general, the more rapidly it kills, the harder it is
to spread widely, because an extremely virulent disease would run out of

**[highly transmissible]{.mark}**, like influenza, [**rarely kill**,
**even absent**]{.mark} **the [countermeasures]{.mark}** of modern

percent.44 That's tremendously high by the standards of the flu, but it
still meant that more than 97 out of every 100 patients survived. Even a
virus like HIV---which kills slowly and shows no symptoms for years,
permitting the infected plenty of time to spread the disease---is
hindered because transmission requires direct contact with blood or with
bodily fluids. The self-replication that makes infectious disease such
an effective weapon also prevents it from becoming a true existential
threat. What viruses and bacteria want---if packets of genes and
single-celled organisms can be said to want anything---is to survive and
to replicate. They can't do that if they kill all humans.

High-Mortality Pandemics

[[A]{.mark} naturally occurring [pandemic]{.mark}]{.underline} (i.e.,
not from an engineered pathogen) [[that]{.mark} would [threaten]{.mark}
human [extinction is a **very small** probability]{.mark}
event]{.underline}. However, historical accounts point to several
instances where disease spread played an important role in causing very
significant decline of specific populations. For example, the
introduction of novel diseases to the Native American population during
the European colonization of the Americas had deadly consequences. It is
difficult to distinguish the effects of the diseases that came with the
Europeans from the war and conflict they also brought with them.
Nevertheless, during the first hundred years of the colonization period,
the American population may have been reduced by as much as 90% (Ord
2020).

Moreover, two major pandemic events, the Justinian Plague in the sixth
century and the Black Death in the fourteenth century appear to have
been severe enough to cause a significant population decline of tens of
percent in the populations they affected. Both events are believed to
have been caused by plague, an infectious disease caused by the bacteria
Yersinia Pestis (Christakos et al. 2005; Allen 1979). While there is a
certain degree of uncertainty involved in studying these events'
societal impacts, historical accounts in combination with modern
scientific methods provide us with some valuable insights into the
effects they may have had on the societies of the time.

With respect to the possibility of a future catastrophic global
pandemic, it appears that this risk is increasing significantly along
with the advances in the field of synthetic biology and the rising
possibility of an accidental or intentional release of an engineered
pathogen. While some of the scientific efforts in the field of synthetic
biology are directed towards increasing our understanding and our
ability to prevent future catastrophic epidemic threats, the risk
stemming from these activities is non-trivial, and may outweigh their
benefits.

The Justinian Plague

The Justinian Plague severely affected the people of Europe and East
Asia, though estimates of its overall mortality vary. Focusing
exclusively on the first wave of the pandemic (AD 541--544), Muehlhauser
(2017) suggests the pandemic was associated with a 20% mortality in the
Byzantine empire. This estimate is based on the mortality rate estimated
for the empire's capital, Constantinople, by Stathakopoulos (2007) to
produce a death toll of roughly 5.6 million. For a longer time span, AD
541 to 600, which included subsequent waves of the plague, scholars
estimate a higher mortality rate of 33--50% (Allen 1979; Meier 2016).

The demographic changes associated with this high mortality led to a
significant disruption of economic activity in the Byzantine empire
(Gârdan 2020). A decline in the labour force caused a decline in
agricultural production which led to food shortages and famine (Meier
2016). Trade also collapsed. Decreased tax revenues caused by the
population decline initiated a major fiscal contraction and consequently
a military crisis for the empire (Sarris 2002; Meier 2016). In the
longer run, however, the massive reduction of the labour force appears
to have had a positive economic effect for the surviving laborers, as
the increased marginal value of labour caused a rise in real wages and
per capita incomes. These beneficial effects for the survivors were also
observed after the Black Death (Pamuk and Shatzmiller 2014; Findlay and
Lundahl 2017).

The mortality and the disruption of activity the plague caused in the
Byzantine empire also led to further direct and indirect cultural and
religious consequences. Meier (2016) particularly highlights the
plague's indirect effect of an increase in liturgification (a process of
religious permeation and internalization throughout society as defined
by Meier 2020), the rise of the Marian cult, and the sacralization of
the emperor.

The direct and indirect effects of the plague also appear to have had
far-reaching and long-term political repercussions. The societal
disruptions caused by the plague are believed to have significantly
weakened the position of the Byzantine empire and arguably led to the
decline of the Sasanian empire (Sabbatani et al. 2012). Interestingly,
the pandemic indirectly favoured the nomadic Arab tribes who were less
vulnerable to the contagion while traveling through desert and
semi-desert environments during the initial expansion of Islam
(Sabbatani et al. 2012).

Of note is the absence of a scientific consensus on the severity of the
Justinian Plague's impacts. For example, Mordechai and Eisenberg (2019)
and Mordechai et al. (2019) argue against the maximalist interpretation
of the historical evidence described above. They suggest that the
estimated mortality rate of the plague is exaggerated, and that the
pandemic was not a primary cause of the transformational demographic,
political and economic changes in the Mediterranean region between the
sixth and eighth century. Recently, White and Mordechai (2020)
highlighted the high likelihood of the plague having different impacts
in the urban areas of the Mediterranean outside of Constantinople.

The Black Death

The Black Death which ravaged Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia in
the middle of the fourteenth century is considered the deadliest
pandemic in human history and potentially the most severe global
catastrophe to have ever struck mankind. With respect to its mortality,
Ord (2020) argues that the best estimate of its global mortality rate is
5--14% of the global population, largely based on Muehlhauser (2017).

The plague created a large demographic shock in the affected regions. It
reduced the European population by approximately 30--50% during the 6
years of its initial outbreak (Ord 2020). It took approximately two
centuries for the population levels to recover (Livi-Bacci 2017; Jedwab
et al. 2019b). As the mortality rates appear to have been the highest
among the working-age population, the effects on the labour force were
acute (Pamuk 2007).

The plague\'s mortality, morbidity and the associated societal
disruption led to a major decline in economic output both in Europe
(Pamuk 2007) and the Middle East (Dols 2019). In Europe, however, this
decline in economic output was smaller than the decline in population;
output per capita began to increase within a few years of the initial
outbreak (Pamuk 2007).

The large demographic shock caused by the plague led to a shift in the
relative price of labour which, similarly to the Justinian Plague, had a
positive impact on wages. With a reduced labour force, real wages and
per capita incomes in many European countries increased and were
sustained at higher levels for several centuries (Voigtländer and Voth
2013a; Jedwab et al. 2020; Pamuk and Shatzmiller 2014). Scott and Duncan
(2001) point out that real wages approximately doubled in most countries
of Europe in the century following the plague.

An additional insight into the long-run relationship between the Black
Death's mortality and per capita incomes in Europe is offered by
Voigtländer and Voth (2013a). Using a Malthusian model, they suggest
that over time, the rise in income caused by the plague's mortality led
to an increase in urbanization and trade. Furthermore, the increased tax
burden (per capita), combined with the contemporary political climate,
increased the frequency of wars. Consequently, higher urbanization and
trade led to an increase in disease spread which along with a more
frequent war occurrence caused a long-term increase in mortality and a
further positive effect on per capita incomes. In this way, the Black
Death appears to have created a long-lasting environment of
high-mortality and high-income specifically in Western Europe,
functioning as an important contributing factor to its economic growth
in the next centuries (Alfani 2020). However, while in Western Europe
incomes remained elevated over the next centuries, in Southern Europe
they began to decline as the Southern European population started
recovering after AD 1500 (Jedwab et al. 2020).

Apart from the positive effects on wages, the increased marginal value
of labour combined with other factors had further economic and social
implications. A decreased relative value of land and the lack of
workforce to use it effectively caused land prices and land rents to
decrease (Jedwab et al. 2020; Pamuk 2007). A decreased marginal value of
capital assets in general led to a lapse in the enforcement of property
rights (Haddock and Kiesling 2002). Interest rates and real rates of
return on assets also decreased (Pamuk 2007; Jedwab et al. 2020; Pamuk
and Shatzmiller 2014; Jordà et al. 2021; Clark 2016).

Higher wages in combination with a relative abundance of land increased
people's access to land/home ownership, likely reducing social
inequality (Alfani 2020). On the other end of the income distribution,
decreased incomes for landowners led to an overall decrease in income
inequality (Jedwab et al. 2020; Alfani and Murphy 2017).

With respect to the effects on agriculture, the structure of
agricultural output moved away from cereals to other crops following the
plague. Furthermore, the workforce shortages and the incentives to
increase the labour supply are believed to have caused a shift from
male-labour intensive arable farming towards pastoral farming,
consequently raising the demand for female labour (Voigtländer and Voth
2013b). However, while the Black Death appears to have caused certain
structural agricultural changes, Clark (2016) finds no effect of the
plague on agricultural productivity in the long run.

In terms of other social consequences, the evidence suggests that the
plague\'s mortality reduced labour coercion, particularly throughout
Western Europe (Jedwab et al. 2020; Haddock and Kiesling 2002; Gingerich
and Vogler 2021). The increased bargaining power of labour caused by the
plague's demographic shock contributed to and accelerated the decline in
serfdom and development of a free labour regime. Gingerich and Voler
(2021) further argue that these effects may have had long-lasting
political implications and that a decline of repressive labour practices
(such as serfdom) permitted the development of more inclusive political
institutions. They find that the regions with the highest mortality were
more likely to develop participatory political institutions and more
equitable land ownership systems. They find that centuries later, In
Germany, the populations in these high-mortality regions were less
likely to vote for Hitler's National Socialist (Nazi) Party in the 1930
and 1932 elections in Germany.

However, the positive effects on the emergence of freer labour did not
take place in Eastern Europe, where serfdom was sustained and even
intensified. Robinson and Torvik (2011) attempt to explain this
asymmetry arguing that these differential outcomes may have been caused
by the varying power and quality of institutions. The authors suggest
that opportunities generated by the increased bargaining power of
labour, in an environment of weak institutions, were less likely to lead
to a positive effect than in the case of regions with stronger
institutions (with more robust rule-of-law or less corrupt or predatory
practices).

Apart from causing a negative demographic shock to the affected
populations, the Black Death appears to have caused further indirect
demographic changes, particularly in Western Europe. The increased
employment opportunities for females caused by worker shortages and a
higher female labour demand led to a decline in fertility rates and an
increased age of marriage (Voigtländer and Voth 2013b). This demographic
transition to a population characterized by lower birth rates likely
helped to preserve the high levels of per capita incomes and contributed
to further economic development of certain parts of Europe, enabling it
to escape the "Malthusian trap" in the following centuries (Pamuk 2007).
Siuda and Sunde (2021) confirm the pandemic's effect on the accelerated
demographic transition empirically, as they find that greater pandemic
mortality was associated with an earlier onset of the demographic
transition across the various regions of Germany.

Unfortunately, the Black Death also led to an increase in the
persecution of Jews (Finley and Koyama 2018; Jedwab et al. 2019a).
Interestingly, Jedwab et al. (2019a) were able to estimate that in the
case of regions with the highest mortality rates, the probability of
persecution decreased if the Jewish minority was believed to benefit the
local economy.

It is important to highlight that the long-term repercussions of the
Black Death were highly asymmetrical. While in Western Europe the
pandemic appears to have led to some long-term dynamic shifts associated
with increased wages, decreased inequality and a decrease in labour
coercion, this was not the case for other regions. A decrease in wages
was observed for example in Spain (Alfani 2020) and Egypt. In Spain, the
plague\'s demographic impact on an already scarce population caused a
long-lasting negative disruption to the local trade-oriented economy.
The workforce disruption in Egypt led to a collapse of the
labour-intensive irrigation system for growing crops in the Nile valley,
with consequent disastrous effects on the rural economy (Alfani 2020).
Borsch (2005) argues that the economic decline in Egypt caused by the
Black Death "put an end to the power in the heartland of the Arab world"
(p. 114) and to the impressive scientific and technological developments
that came out of this region.

A consensus for an explanation of the Black Death's varied impacts
across regions, and their determinants, does not appear to exist.
However, several researchers attempt to provide partial insights. For
example, Alfani (2020) considers the differential outcomes to be broadly
dependent upon the initial conditions in each region. More specifically,
both Robinson and Torvik (2011) and Pamuk (2007) propose that the
asymmetry of impacts can largely be explained by the differences in the
institutional environments of the affected societies.

It is argued that the Black Death defined the threshold between the
medieval and the modern ages, similarly to the way the Justinian Plague
did for antiquity and the Middle Ages (Horden 2021). Furthermore, the
differential long-term outcomes of the Black Death likely provided a
significant contribution to the so-called "Great Divergence" between
Europe and the rest of the world and the "Little Divergence" between
North-western and Southern and Eastern Europe (Jedwab et al. 2020; Pamuk
2007).

From this perspective, it would seem rational to conclude that apart
from causing substantial and long-term demographic, economic, political,
and cultural changes, both the Justinian Plague and the Black Death
likely significantly altered the course of human history.

Considering the above, it is not unreasonable to expect that a pandemic
of a similar magnitude to these past catastrophes would do the same in
the present day. However, what societal impacts a pandemic of similar or
higher mortality would inflict in the twenty-first century has not
really been the subject of any study, as far as we were able to
identify. A possibility exists, given the newly developed capacity of
humanity to create new pathogens, that the outcomes of a future
catastrophic pandemic will be even more adverse than those of the
Justinian Plague and the Black Death.

When James Clapper, the U.S. director of national intelligence at the
time, appeared before Congress in early January 2016 for an annual
briefing of threats to the United States, he didn't lack for material.
Just a few weeks earlier, **[[No]{.mark}rth
[Ko]{.mark}rea]{.underline}** had [tested a **nuclear
device**]{.underline}, and [**[Russia]{.mark}** had begun deploying
**cruise missiles**]{.underline} that appeared to violate a crucial
arms-control agreement. [But to]{.underline} the surprise of many
**[[experts]{.underline}]{.mark}**, Clapper [**[devote]{.mark}**d a good
chunk of]{.underline} his [[time to]{.underline}]{.mark} describing
[[a]{.mark} **much [more]{.mark}** [exotic threat]{.mark}: biomedical
research]{.underline}. Specifically, [[Clapper
warned]{.underline}](https://thebulletin.org/2016/04/how-genetic-editing-became-a-national-security-threat/),
"Research in genome editing conducted by countries with different
regulatory or ethical standards than those of Western countries probably
increases the risk of the creation of potentially harmful biological
agents or products."

Clapper's statement didn't explicitly mention China---but it didn't need
to. As his testimony went on to make clear, while in the 20th century
the United States and Soviet Union held the [keys to preventing
**planetary [catastrophe]{.mark}**]{.underline}, in the 21st the
principal players [are the **United States and China**]{.underline}. And
[while [in a previous age]{.mark}]{.underline} keeping Pandora's box
closed [[meant]{.mark} preventing [**nuclear war**, today it's]{.mark}
about **preventing [biotech]{.mark}** dangers]{.underline}.

In just the past few years, the development of inexpensive gene-editing
techniques has democratized biomedical research, producing a
[biotech]{.underline} bonanza [[in]{.underline}]{.mark} places such as
**[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}** and creating [[a whole **new**]{.mark}
**category** of **security [threat]{.mark}**s]{.underline} in the
process, from the use of genetic information to persecute dissidents and
minority groups to the development of sophisticated bioweapons.

When it comes to the United States, China, and technology, artificial
intelligence tends to grab most of the attention. But [**policymakers**
need to come to grips with the **even bigger** threat of
**biotechnology**]{.underline}---and soon. Fortunately, though, shared
concerns about China's role in biotechnology also provide a rare chance
for meaningful and productive engagement in shaping the rules of a new
world.

China's starring role in preventing the 21st century's biotech perils
stems from its skyrocketing investment in biomedical research.
Historically, Western countries, and especially the United States, have
been the epicenter of research in the life sciences. The United States
alone accounted for some [[45
percent]{.underline}](https://itif.org/publications/2018/03/26/how-ensure-americas-life-sciences-sector-remains-globally-competitive) of
biotech and medical patents filed in the 14-year period ending in 2013.
But now, thanks to heavy state-backed investment, [[China is **catching
up**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Economic plans instituted in 2015 call for
the biotechnology sector to account for more than 4 percent of China's
total GDP by 2020, and [[estimates
suggest]{.underline}](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-00542-3) that
as of 2018, central, provincial, and local governments had already
invested over \$100 billion in the life sciences. Chinese venture
capital and private equity investment in the life sciences, meanwhile,
totaled some \$45 billion just from 2015 to 2017.

[[China]{.mark} has]{.underline} also [**invested** considerable effort
in [competing with]{.mark}]{.underline} countries like [[the
**U**]{.mark}**nited [S]{.mark}tates**]{.underline} for biotech talent.
Of some [[7,000 researchers
recruited]{.underline}](http://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-00542-3) under
the Thousand Talents Plan since 2008, more than 1,400 specialized in the
life sciences. A leading American geneticist, Harris Lewin,
has [[warned]{.underline}](https://www.wired.com/story/wildebeest-okapi-giraffe-ibex-come-peruse-their-genomes/) that
the United States is "starting to fall behind ... the Chinese, who have
always been good collaborators, \[are\] now taking the lead."

For the United States and other Western countries, China's growing role
in biomedical research is raising plenty of concern. Several Chinese
researchers have shown a willingness to ignore ethical and regulatory
constraints on genetic research. In 2018, He Jiankui became a poster
child for scientific irresponsibility when he announced he had edited
the genes of two twins in utero without following basic safety
protocols. He [[reportedly
dismissed]{.underline}](https://dev.biologists.org/content/146/3/dev175778) them
as guidelines, not laws.

Yet the reaction at home was not what He had hoped for. His research had
been made possible by the relatively lax standards of Chinese
universities, even as he had kept the true nature of it secret from many
involved -- while discussing it with a [[small
group]{.underline}](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/16/health/stanford-gene-editing-babies.html) of
Western bioethicists and scientists, who stressed their disapproval.
It's not uncommon in China to break the rules and be lauded for the
results anyway, whatever the field. For He, though, the vast
international attention that came after the story broke cost him his
career and possibly [[his
freedom]{.underline}](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/21/world/asia/china-gene-editing-babies-he-jiankui.html?module=inline).
Chinese media rushed to stress [[official
disapproval]{.underline}](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/08/untold-story-circle-trust-behind-world-s-first-gene-edited-babies) of
the experiments. Even the [[overt
purpose]{.underline}](https://www.statnews.com/2019/04/15/jiankui-embryo-editing-ccr5/) of
the editing -- to ensure that the babies, born to HIV+ mothers, enjoyed
protection against the virus -- turned out to be scientifically weak.

As China's biotech sector grows, so too do fears that Chinese
researchers like He will be more willing to push the limits of both
science and ethics than those in the United States. Earlier this year,
Chinese researchers recorded another mind-bending milestone when
they [[implanted]{.underline}](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/613277/chinese-scientists-have-put-human-brain-genes-in-monkeysand-yes-they-may-be-smarter/) human
genes linked to intelligence into monkey embryos---and then said that
the monkeys performed better on memory tests.

The dominance of the party-state in China raises serious concerns around
biotechnology, especially because it carries increasingly
ethnonationalist tone. When in 2018 Chinese researchers created the
world's first primate clones, for example, they dubbed them Zhong Zhong
and Hua Hua, from the term zhonghua meaning "The Chinese Nation"---an
oddly jingoistic moniker for a pair of monkeys. Chinese government
policies often blur the line between eugenics and education, lumped
together as improving the "quality" (suzhi) of the population, which
received another stamp of
official [[endorsement]{.underline}](https://twitter.com/globaltimesnews/status/1191681436635451392) following
the recent Fourth Plenum. These programs are carried out through the
country's huge so-called family planning bureaucracy---originally
established to enforce the one-child policy.

Moreover, Beijing is increasingly extending its formidable social
control apparatus into the realm of genetics. While there are
considerable restrictions on private firms sharing biomedical data,
largely because of an ugly history of [[popular
discrimination]{.underline}](https://www.theatlantic.com/china/archive/2013/12/chinas-struggle-with-hepatitis-b-discrimination/281994/) against
hepatitis carriers, the government has no such restrictions. A [[New
York
Times report]{.underline}](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/21/business/china-xinjiang-uighur-dna-thermo-fisher.html) earlier
this year suggested, for example, that Chinese authorities had assembled
a vast trove of genetic data on Chinese citizens without their consent,
with the Uighur minority group having been specifically targeted.

[**[Beijing]{.mark}**'s]{.underline} brand of
[**[bio-nationalism]{.mark}** also **directly [threatens]{.mark}** [the
**U**]{.mark}**nited [S]{.mark}tates**]{.underline}. U.S. officials have
been [[warning]{.underline}](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/04/health/china-nih-scientists.html) universities
and research institutions that the [**biotech sector** is a focal point
for Chinese **industrial espionage**]{.underline} activities in the
United States. And this past August, a senior Defense Department
official warned Congress that [[China's]{.mark} **growing
[role]{.mark}** [in **pharma**]{.mark}**ceutical manufacturing**
[could]{.mark}]{.underline} allow it to [[disrupt]{.mark} **deliveries
of critical [battlefield medicines]{.mark}**[, or]{.mark}]{.underline}
potentially [even [[**alter them** to
harm](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/we-rely-on-china-for-pharmaceutical-drugs-thats-a-security-threat/2019/09/10/5f35e1ce-d3ec-11e9-9343-40db57cf6abd_story.html) ]{.mark}**U.S.
[forces]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Yet the [biggest risks posed by **[biotech]{.mark}**, for
China]{.underline}, the United States, and other countries, pertain to
nonstate actors. A critical feature of modern biotech, [[in contrast
to]{.underline}]{.mark} technology like **[[nuc]{.mark}lear
weapon[s]{.mark}]{.underline}**, is that [[it's]{.mark} **cheap and
[easy]{.mark}** [to develop]{.mark}]{.underline}. A technique known as
**[[CRISPR]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which the Chinese researcher He used
in his illicit gene-editing work, makes it practical for just about
anyone to manipulate the genomes of just about any organism they can lay
their hands on. CRISPR makes it much simpler to skirt ethical
restrictions and [**terrifyingly [straightforward]{.mark}** [for
**terrorist**]{.mark} **group[s]{.mark}** [to
develop]{.mark}]{.underline} fearsome **[biological
[weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

Researchers have
already [[shown]{.underline}](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0188453) it's
possible to reconstruct the smallpox virus, which was eradicated in the
real world in the 1970s, for as little as \$200,000 using DNA fragments
you can order online. If a terrorist or rogue state were to successfully
do so, virtually [[**no one alive** would have]{.mark} **any
[resistance]{.mark}** to the **virus**]{.underline}---and most
stockpiles of the vaccine were destroyed long ago. There is an
organization, the [[International Gene Synthesis
Consortium]{.underline}](https://genesynthesisconsortium.org/), that
tries to screen suspicious orders for DNA fragments that might be used
to build such bioweapons. And while most of the world's major DNA
synthesis firms belong to the consortium, membership is completely
voluntary, and there's also a [[thriving and entirely
unregulated]{.underline}](https://www.wired.com/story/synthetic-biology-vaccines-viruses-horsepox/) black
market---much of it based in China.

All of [[this means]{.mark} that **biosecurity [standards]{.mark}**
[in]{.mark} places like [**China** matter]{.mark} more than
ever]{.underline}. After all, [[if a]{.mark} **major
bio[weapon]{.mark}** [were]{.mark}]{.underline} to be [[unleashed, it's
unlikely]{.underline}]{.mark} that **[[any]{.underline}]{.mark}** major,
globally integrated [[country could **escape**]{.mark}
**unharmed**.]{.underline} Fortunately, there are growing signs China is
open to better regulation of its biotech sector. In February, the
Chinese government announced that "[[high
risk]{.underline}](https://www.statnews.com/2019/02/27/china-unveils-new-rules-on-biotech-after-gene-editing-scandal/)"
biomedical research would be overseen by the State Council, China's
equivalent of the cabinet---a sign of the concern with which Beijing
views incidents like the He Jiankui CRISPR scandal. In a further sign of
this concern, in August, the Chinese Communist Party announced the
creation of a [[new
committee]{.underline}](http://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02362-5) to
advise top leaders on research ethics.

I've lived through disease outbreaks, and in the previous chapter I
showed just how unprepared we are to face a widespread pandemic of flu
or another new pathogen like SARS. But [a [**deliberate** outbreak
caused by an **engineered** pathogen would be]{.mark} **far
[worse]{.mark}**]{.underline}. We would face the same agonizing
decisions that must be made during a natural pandemic: whether to ban
travel from affected regions, how to keep overburdened hospitals working
as the rolls of the sick grew, how to accelerate the development and
distribution of vaccines and drugs. To that dire list add the
[terror]{.underline} that [would **spread**]{.underline} once it became
clear that the death and disease in our midst was not the random work of
nature, but a deliberate act of malice. We're scared of disease
outbreaks and we're scared of terrorism---put them together and you have
[a formula for **chaos**]{.underline}.

As deadly and as disruptive as a conventional bioterror incident would
be, an attack that employed existing pathogens could only spread so far,
limited by the same laws of evolution that circumscribe natural disease
outbreaks. But [a [virus engineered]{.mark} in a lab to
break]{.underline} those [laws [could **spread faster** and **kill
quicker**]{.mark} than **anything** that would emerge out of nature. It
can be [designed to **evade medical countermeasures**]{.mark},
frustrating doctors' attempts to diagnose cases and treat patients. If
health officials manage to stamp out the outbreak, it could be
[**reintroduced** into the public **again** and **again**]{.mark}. It
could, with the right mix of genetic traits, even **wipe us off the
planet**, making engineered [viruses a **genuine**]{.mark}
**[existential threat]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[And]{.underline} such [an [attack may **not**]{.mark} **even
[be]{.mark} that [difficult]{.mark}** to carry out. Thanks to [advances
in **biotech**]{.mark}]{.underline}nology [that have [**rapidly
reduced** the **skill level** and **funding** needed to perform **gene
editi**ng and **engineer**ing]{.mark}]{.underline}, what might have once
required the [work]{.underline} of an army of virologists employed by a
nation-state [could soon be done by]{.underline} a handful of talented
and trained [individuals]{.underline}. Or maybe just one.

When Melinda Gates was asked at the South by Southwest conference in
2018 to identify what she saw as [the **biggest threat** facing the
world]{.underline} over the next decade, she didn't hesitate: "A
**[bioterrorism]{.underline}** event. Definitely."2

She's far from alone. In 2016, President Obama's director of national
intelligence James Clapper identified CRISPR as a "weapon of mass
destruction," a category usually reserved for known nightmares like
nuclear bombs and chemical weapons. A 2018 report from the National
Academies of Sciences concluded that
[**[biotech]{.underline}**nology]{.mark} [had [rewritten what was
possible]{.mark} in creating new weapons]{.underline}, while also
increasing the range of people capable of carrying out such attacks.3
That's [a fatal combination]{.underline}, one [that]{.underline}
plausibly [**threatens the future of humanity** like **nothing
else**]{.underline}.

"[The **existential threat** that would be **most available** for
someone, if they felt like doing something, would be a
**bioweapon**]{.underline}," said Eric Klien, founder of the Lifeboat
Foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to helping humanity survive
existential risks. "It would not be hard for a small group of people,
maybe even just two or three people, to kill a hundred million people
using a bioweapon. [There are]{.underline} probably [a [million
people]{.mark}]{.underline} currently on the planet [who would [have the
technical knowledge]{.mark} to pull this off]{.underline}. It's actually
surprising that it hasn't happened yet."

#### Pharma innovation is [high now]{.underline}.

[[Pharma]{.underline}]{.mark}ceutical [[innovation]{.mark} is
[moving]{.mark} [at]{.mark} a **[staggering pace]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
And behind every great research group driving the industry, there is
also a team of collaborators, patients and experts from various
backgrounds playing a key part in enabling discoveries and bringing
novel therapeutics to market. [As the world has been focused on
tackling]{.underline} the **[Covid]{.underline}**-19 pandemic over the
last 18 months, [it's no surprise to see the
[pharma]{.mark}]{.underline}ceutical [sector **[increasingly]{.mark}
[develop]{.mark}** and **strengthen [partnerships]{.mark}** [to]{.mark}
**[accelerate]{.mark} [innovations]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [From the
**[growing]{.mark} range** of **[patient]{.mark} entities**]{.underline}
through [[to]{.mark} new [possibilities]{.mark} stemming [from]{.mark}
[tech]{.mark}nology [and]{.mark} patient-generated
[data]{.mark}]{.underline}, the [pharma]{.underline}ceutical [industry
has continued to [identify]{.mark} more and more [ways to
**improve**]{.mark} the [sector]{.mark}]{.underline}. [This includes
more collaboration with patients]{.underline}, [advocacy groups and its
workforce]{.underline}. Opening a dialogue within the industry, and
extending that to include patients, is [[creating]{.mark} a new
[culture]{.mark} [that fosters]{.mark} those **all-important [lightbulb
moments]{.mark}** more rapidly than ever before]{.underline}. As the
pharmaceutical industry continues to emerge from the setbacks of
Covid-19, it has been noted that the [[companies]{.underline}]{.mark}
that have [[come back]{.mark} [stronger]{.mark} than before]{.underline}
are the same ones that have spent time training and upskilling their
workers. However, the need for this attitude shift has not just come
from the pandemic: the digitalised industrial revolution has also forced
a need to retrain staff in certain positions.

[China]{.underline}: [the **biotech elephant** in the room]{.underline}

I've written previously written how the Chinese government is already
making substantial investments in its bioeconomy. Here are three scary
statistics, courtesy of Greg B. Scott of the ChinaBio Group:

[[China]{.mark} is **[out-investing]{.mark}** the U.S]{.underline}.
[[China]{.mark}'s private investors [poured]{.mark} **[\$14.4
billion]{.mark}** into its bioeconomy]{.underline} in 2019. That
[[compare]{.mark}s [to]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates**[[']{.underline}]{.mark}** [more
**meager** investment of **[\$10.4 billion]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[[China]{.mark} is [building]{.mark} a **[bigger bioecon]{.mark}omy
[workforce]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[China]{.mark}
[grad]{.mark}uate[s]{.mark}]{.underline} about 8-[[10]{.mark}
[million]{.mark} students each year]{.underline}. [In the
[U.S]{.mark}]{.underline}., that [number is]{.underline} closer to
[[400,000]{.underline}]{.mark}. Many [Chinese students graduating from
U.S. institutions]{.underline} stay here, but they are [increasingly
returning home to start **highly innovative companies**]{.underline}.

[[China]{.mark} is [investing in **itself**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Historically, China has invested heavily in foreign companies, tech, and
debt. Now [we're [seeing]{.mark} an [uptick in **China-to-China**
investments]{.mark}]{.underline}---the [country no longer needs to look
abroad]{.underline} to find plenty of good biotech opportunities.

Chinese investments have led to centers of excellence in the regional
technology hub of Shenzhen, including the Institute of Synthetic Biology
at the Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Sciences (SIAT) and BGI Genomics.
Shenzhen will compete for technological and economic leadership with
U.S. regional biotech powerhouses such as San Francisco/Silicon Valley
and Boston/Cambridge in the years to come. Many of China's long-standing
challenges---environment, food, water, waste management, and rapid
innovation to retain its global manufacturing competitiveness---are
areas where synthetic biology is seen as a key technology for the
future. In other words, synthetic biology is not just an academic
pursuit for [[China]{.underline}]{.mark}. Rather, its [[leaders]{.mark}
are [thinking **proactively**]{.mark} about how biological engineering
can be used to address]{.underline} the country's [strategic national
interests]{.underline}---[[while]{.mark} [U.S.]{.mark} leadership
**[stands idly by]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

### 1AR\-\--AT: China\-\--Pharma Innovation High

#### Pharma innovation is strong now. Solves emerging diseases. 

Tanja **Dowe 21,**CEO of Debiopharm Innovation Fund, the strategic
investment arm of the Swiss pharmaceutical company Debiopharm. 10/5/21,
"The 'patient of the future' is driving radical innovation in
healthcare."
https://pharmaphorum.com/patients/future-patient-radical-innovation-healthcare-debiopharm/

[[Digital]{.mark} [data]{.mark} collection, [utilisation of real-word
data and patient-centric thinking]{.mark}]{.underline} will all
[[contribute to the **rapid development of a new healthcare
landscape**]{.underline}]{.mark}, says Debiopharm Innovation Fund's
Tanja Dowe.

In recent years, [[we have seen thinking shift from focusing on]{.mark}
a disease's [treatment to]{.mark}]{.underline} seriously considering the
wider [potential for its [prevention, enabled by dramatic advances in
data science]{.mark}]{.underline} and supported by a pressing need to
reduce healthcare costs.

Leaps forward in both digital tools and widespread collection of medical
and health data have provided many opportunities for the healthcare
industry to adapt and change. The advent of COVID-19 has been a great
testing environment for these technologies where, for example, the
adoption of telemedicine was no longer an option but an urgent need to
plug the gap in face-to-face medical care.

[The [healthcare industry is also changing as its 'customers' move from
'boomer' patients to digital natives]{.mark}]{.underline}. These
individuals no longer accept the patient role of past generations. They
want to be involved, proactive contributors to their own health, with
access to their own health information.

This was also one of the key messages from the recent Healthcare
Automation and Digitalization Congress (AUTOMA+) 2021, at which I led a
round-table discussion on the 'prevention versus treatment'.

The traditional patient role is rapidly changing

The world over, [a [dramatic shift is occurring]{.mark} in the
characteristics of the]{.underline} typical [patient]{.underline}. The
time of individuals relying entirely on face-to-face interaction with
their doctors is long past. In its place, a new persona has emerged.
[The 'patient of the future' demands control of their own
healthcare]{.underline} -- they are proactive individuals who follow
their own health status with one of the almost 400 wearable devices on
the market already today, and receive personalised health improvement
advice through an app. They want personalised care all across the
medical care pathway as well.

We can start to understand how we, in the healthcare industry, must
respond to this seismic shift by looking initially at what is driving
the transformation and, in particular, at three key factors.

Firstly, there is an ever-present need to reduce healthcare costs. This
was a priority for healthcare services pre-COVID and is even more
critical now in order to manage the huge burden of disease as we start
to re-open the world. Prevention and treatment services for
non-communicable diseases (NCDs) alone have been severely disrupted
since the pandemic began, and the World Health Organization predicts a
long-term upsurge in deaths from NCDs in the months and years that
follow. Without finding a way to make healthcare more cost-efficient,
the outcomes for patients are likely to fall sharply.

Secondly, [[there has been an unprecedented tech]{.mark}nological [drive
in the last decade,]{.mark} [accelerated by increased medical data,
advances in]{.mark}]{.underline} artificial intelligence [([AI) and an
abundance (and increased consumerisation) of digital
tools]{.underline}]{.mark}, sparked by growing market appeal -- as seen
with the popularisation of health apps and digital monitoring systems,
for example.

Zhao et al. \[78\] proposed the [integration of]{.underline}
**[IoT]{.underline}** technology [to]{.underline} **[real-time
production]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} **[agriculture]{.underline}**
crops with remote monitoring and wireless communication [using the
internet]{.underline}. This constitutes a management system of
information which is also designed to handle the crop data for research
purposes. Ning and Wang \[79\] differentiated IoT in two aspects, namely
Unit IoT and Ubiquitous IoT, where man\'s like neural model (MLN) is
considered in unit IoT and a global integration of unit IoT is
considered as ubiquitous IoT. [Using this combination]{.underline}, a
social organization framework model (SOF) was constructed for the
relationship and development of IoT. Yane \[80\] discussed various
methods to design the IoT architecture for agriculture wherein the
Agriculture information technology (AIT) concept was used to analyze the
features of agriculture data. Ma et al. \[81\] reported [the use of
sensor networks design on IoT in agriculture for monitoring the crops,
and the design is evaluated using parameters such as reliability, cost,
interoperability, and management to ensure the right
design]{.underline}. Hu et al. \[71\] proposed the concept of embedding
the IoT applications with crops growth, which makes the system adaptive
and intelligent by experimenting on different fields. All these
abovementioned studies emphasized the challenges faced in developing an
intelligent system.

According to International Business Machines Corporation (IBM), [IoT
implementation should increase agricultural yields by]{.underline}
**[70%]{.underline}** within the coming thirty years. In fact[, IoT
is]{.underline} **[well equipped]{.underline}** [to tackle problems
encountered by today\'s growers]{.underline}. [There are a]{.underline}
**[large number]{.underline}** [of smart technologies within the
Agritech sector that are designed to satisfy farmers]{.underline}.
On-site monitoring of watering, planting, crop intake, and pest levels
allows for more effective site control. The [most]{.underline} **[common
use]{.underline}** [for IoT]{.underline} in agriculture [is
in]{.underline} **[considering weather patterns]{.underline}**. The
unsettled nature of climatic conditions mean that expected crop yields
change regularly. [Changes in the elements, such as humidity,
temperature, rainfall, sunlight, and wind, can be monitored from sites
in specific fields.]{.underline} The delicate nature of cultivating
under glass means that constant monitoring is needed. Therefore, many
opportunities are there to introduce smart technologies for assisting
this from afar, as they are readily able to monitor variables such as
light, humidity, temperature, and atmospheric compositions, as well as
adjust them to keep within a desired range. T[he ability to transmit
real time warnings when levels are exceeded ensures operational
efficiency.]{.underline} Both indoor and outdoor farming spaces are
suitable for [smart sensor installations]{.underline}, and [can lead to
a]{.underline} **[stronger]{.underline}**, **[more unified approach to
agricultural manageme]{.underline}**nt. It is anticipated that any such
system should aim to interface freely with other smart elements aimed at
account and procurement management, so that whole system efficiency may
be maximized. The [data collected from sensors monitoring soil moisture,
humidity, and crop condition can be analyzed using a variety of
pre-planned or adaptive techniques in a smart system, which allows for
the irrigation of said crops to be dynamically managed.]{.underline}

[The **[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [faces]{.mark} many

control**.]{.underline} Concurrently, [we face threats to our future
security posed by growing civil strife, famine, and refugee and
migration challenges which create incubators for extremist and
anti-American government factions]{.underline}. Our response cannot be
one dimensional but instead must be a nuanced and comprehensive National
Security Strategy combining all elements of National Power including a
Food Security Strategy. [An **[American Food]{.mark} Security Strategy**
[is]{.mark} an [imperative]{.mark} factor [in **reducing**]{.mark} **the
multiple [threats]{.mark} impacting our National
wellbeing.**]{.underline} [Recent history has shown that **[reliable
food]{.mark} supplies and stable prices [produce more stable]{.mark} and
secure [countries]{.mark}.** Conversely, food insecurity, particularly
in poorer countries, can lead to instability, unrest, and violence.
**[Food insecurity]{.mark}** drives **[mass migration]{.mark}** around
the world from the Middle East, to Africa, to Southeast Asia,
destabilizing neighboring populations, **generating conflicts**, and
threatening our own security by **disrupting** our **economic, military,
and diplomatic relationships**.]{.underline} [Food system shocks from
extreme food-price volatility can be correlated with protests and
riots.]{.underline} Food price related protests toppled governments in
Haiti and Madagascar in 2007 and 2008. In 2010 and in 2011, food prices
and grievances related to food policy were one of the major drivers of
the Arab Spring uprisings. Repeatedly, history has taught us that [[**a
strong agricultural sector** is **an**]{.mark} **unquestionable
[requirement]{.mark}** for]{.underline} inclusive and sustainable
growth, broad-based development progress, and **[long-term
stability]{.underline}**. The impact can be remarkable and far reaching.
[**Rising income**, in addition to reducing the opportunities for an
upsurge in extremism, leads to changes in diet, producing **demand** for
more diverse and nutritious foods provided, in many cases, from
**American farmers** and ranchers.]{.underline} [**[Emerging
markets]{.mark}** currently [purchase]{.mark} **[20 percent of U.S.
agriculture]{.mark}** exports and that figure is **expected to grow** as
populations boom.]{.underline} Moving early to ensure stability in
strategically significant regions requires long term planning and a
disciplined, thoughtful strategy. To combat current threats and work to
prevent future ones, our national leadership must employ the entire
spectrum of our power including diplomatic, economic, and cultural
elements. The best means to prevent future chaos and the resulting
instability is positive engagement addressing the causes of instability
before it occurs. This is not rocket science. We know where the
instability is most likely to occur. The world population will grow by
2.5 billion people by 2050. Unfortunately, this massive population boom
is projected to occur primarily in the most fragile and food insecure
countries. This alarming math is not just about total numbers.
Projections show that the greatest increase is in the age groups most
vulnerable to extremism. There are currently 200 million people in
Africa between the ages of 15 and 24, with that number expected to
double in the next 30 years. Already, 60% of the unemployed in Africa
are young people. Too often **[[these situations deteriorate into
shooting wars]{.underline}]{.mark}** requiring the deployment of our
military forces. We should be continually mindful that the price we pay
for committing military forces is measured in our most precious national
resource, the blood of those who serve. For those who live in **[rural
America]{.underline}**, this has a disproportionate impact. Fully 40% of
those who serve in our military come from the farms, ranches, and
non-urban communities that make up only 16% of our population. Actions
taken now to increase agricultural sector jobs can provide economic
opportunity and stability for those unemployed youths while helping to
feed people. A recent report by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs
identifies agriculture development as the core essential for providing
greater food security, economic growth, and population well-being. [Our
active support for **food security**, including agriculture development,
has helped **stabilize key regions** over the past 60 years. A robust
food security strategy, as a part of our overall security strategy, can
[mitigate the growth of terrorism, build important relationships, and
support continued American economic]{.mark} and agricultural
[prosperity]{.mark} while materially contributing to our Nation's and
the world's security.]{.underline}

### 2AC -- Warming

#### The Internet of Things solves a global transition to renewable energy -- that solves global warming

**Rifkin,** 10/26/**15**- author of over 20 books on the environment and
economics and Senior Lecturer at the Wharton School of Business (Jeremy
Rifkin, 10/26/15, "The Rise of the Internet of Things and the Race to a
Zero Marginal Cost Society,"
<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jeremy-rifkin/internet-of-things_b_8306112.html>)

[The bulk of the energy we use]{.underline} to heat our homes and run
our appliances, power our businesses, drive our vehicles and operate
every part of the global economy [will be generated at near zero
marginal cost and be nearly free in the coming decades.]{.underline}
That\'s already the case for several million early adopters in the
European Union who have transformed their homes and businesses into
micro power plants to harvest renewable energy onsite. Currently, around
25 percent of the electricity powering Germany comes from renewable
energies. By 2020, the country aims to increase that to 35 percent.
[[The quickening pace of renewable energy deployment is
due]{.underline},]{.mark} in large part, [[to the plunging cost of solar
and wind]{.mark} energy []{.mark}harvesting
[tech]{.mark}nologies.]{.underline} The fixed costs of solar and wind
harvesting technologies have been on exponential curves for more than 20
years, not unlike the exponential curve in computing. In 1977, the cost
of generating a single watt of solar electricity was more than \$76. By
the last quarter of 2012, the cost of generating a watt had fallen to
\$0.50, and by 2017 the cost is projected to fall to \$0.36 per watt.
After the fixed costs for the installation of solar and wind are paid
back \-- often in as little as 2 to 8 years \-- the marginal cost of the
harvested energy is nearly free. [Unlike fossil fuels]{.underline} and
uranium for nuclear power, [in which the commodity itself always costs
something, the sun collected on rooftops and the wind traveling up the
side of buildings are free. In some regions]{.underline} of Europe and
America, [solar and wind energy is already]{.underline} as cheap, or
[cheaper, than fossil fuel or nuclear]{.underline} generated [energy.
The impact]{.underline} on society [of near zero marginal cost solar and
wind energy is]{.underline} all the [more pronounced when we consider
the enormous potential of these energy sources.]{.underline} The sun
beams 470 exajoules of energy to Earth every 88 minutes \-- equaling the
amount of energy human beings use in a year. [[If we could grab]{.mark}
hold of [one-tenth of 1 percent of the sun\'s energy]{.mark} that
reaches Earth, [it would give us six times the energy we now use]{.mark}
across the global economy.]{.underline} Like solar radiation, wind is
ubiquitous and blows everywhere in the world \-- although its strength
and frequency varies. A Stanford University study on global wind
capacity concluded that [[if 20 percent of the world\'s]{.mark}
available [wind was harvested, it would generate]{.mark} more than
[seven times more electricity]{.mark} than we currently use to run the
entire global economy. **[The I]{.mark}nternet [o]{.mark}f
[T]{.mark}hings [will enable businesses and prosumers to monitor their
electricity usage]{.mark}** in their buildings, **[optimize their energy
efficiency and share surplus green electricity]{.mark}** generated
on-site **[with others across]{.mark}** nations and
**[continents.]{.mark}**]{.underline} The Energy Internet is comprised
of five foundational pillars, all of which have to be phased in
simultaneously for the system to operate efficiently. 1. Buildings and
other infrastructure will need to be refurbished and retrofitted to make
them more energy-efficient so that renewable energy technologies \--
solar, wind, etc. \-- can be installed to generate power for immediate
use or for delivery back to the electricity grid for compensation. 2.
Ambitious targets must be set to replace fossil fuels and nuclear power
with renewable energy sources. To achieve this goal, feed-in tariffs
need to be introduced to encourage early adopters to transform buildings
and property sites into micro power generation facilities. The feed-in
tariffs guarantee a premium price above market value for renewable
energies generated locally and sent back to the electricity grid. 3.
Storage technologies including hydrogen fuel cells, batteries, water
pumping, etc., will need to be embedded at local generation sites and
across the electricity grid to manage both the flow of intermittent
green electricity and the stabilization of peak and base loads. 4.
Advanced meters and other digital technologies will need to be installed
in every building to transform the electricity grid from
servo-mechanical to digital connectivity in order to manage multiple
sources of energy flowing to the grid from local generators. The
distributed smart electricity infrastructure will enable passive
consumers of electricity to become active producers of their own green
electricity, which they can then use off-grid to manage their
facilitates or sell back to the Energy Internet. 5. Every parking space
will need to be equipped with a charging station to allow electric and
fuel cell vehicles to secure power from the Energy Internet, as well as
sell power back to the electricity grid. Millions of electric and fuel
cell vehicles connected to the Energy Internet also provide a massive
backup storage system that can send electricity to the grid during peak
demand, when the price of electricity has spiked, allowing vehicle
owners to be appropriately compensated for contributing their
electricity to the network. The phase-in and the integration of the
above five pillars transforms the electricity grid from a centralized to
a distributed electricity system, and from fossil fuel and nuclear
generation to renewable energy. [In the new system, every business,
neighborhood and homeowner becomes the producer of electricity,
sharing]{.underline} his or her [surplus with others on a smart Energy
Internet that is beginning to stretch across national and continental
landmasses.]{.underline} The democratization of energy is forcing
electricity companies to rethink their business practices. A decade ago,
four giant vertically integrated electricity-generating companies \--
E.ON, RWE, EnBW and Vattenfall \-- produced much of the electricity
powering Germany. Today, these companies are no longer the exclusive
arbiters of power generation. In recent years, farmers, urban dwellers
and small and medium-sized enterprises established electricity
cooperatives across Germany. Virtually all of the electricity
cooperatives were successful in securing low-interest loans from banks
to install solar, wind and other renewable energies onsite. The banks
were more than happy to provide the loans, assured that the funds would
be paid back by the premium price the cooperatives would receive \-- via
feed-in tariffs \-- from selling the new green electricity back to the
grid. Today, the majority of the green electricity powering Germany is
being generated by small players in electricity cooperatives. While
these traditional vertically integrated power companies proved quite
successful in generating relatively cheap electricity from traditional
fossil fuels and nuclear power, they have not been able to effectively
compete with local electricity cooperatives whose laterally scaled
operations are better at managing energy harnessed by thousands of small
players in broad collaborative networks. Peter Terium, CEO of RWE, the
German energy company, told Reuters that a massive shift is taking place
in Germany from centralized to distributed power, and said that the
bigger power and utility companies \"have to adjust to the fact that, in
the longer term, earning capacity in conventional electricity generation
will be markedly below what we\'ve seen in recent years.\" A growing
number of [electricity-generating companies are coming to grips with the
new reality of democratized energy and are changing their business
models to accommodate the new Energy Internet.]{.underline} In the
future, [their income will]{.underline} increasingly [rely
on]{.underline} erecting and operating the Energy Internet [managing
their customers\' energy use. The electricity companies will mine Big
Data]{.underline} across each of their clients\' value chains [and use
analytics to create algorithms and applications to increase]{.underline}
their aggregate [energy efficiency and productivity, and
reduce]{.underline} their [marginal cost.]{.underline} Their
[clients]{.underline}, in turn, [will share the efficiency and
productivity gains back with the electricity companies in]{.underline}
what are called [\"performance contracts.\"]{.underline} In short,
[power companies will profit more from managing energy use more
efficiently and selling less]{.underline} rather than more
[electricity.]{.underline} The Automated, GPS-Guided Transportation and
Logistics Internet [The meshing of the Communication Internet and the
Energy Internet makes possible the build-out and scale-up of the
automated Transportation and Logistics Internet. The convergence of
these three Internets comprise the kernel of the Internet of
Things]{.underline} platform [for managing, powering and transporting
goods in a Third Industrial Revolution economy.]{.underline} The
automated Transportation and Logistics Internet is made up of four
foundational pillars, which, like the Energy Internet, have to be
phased-in simultaneously for the system to operate efficiently. 1. As
mentioned previously, charging stations will need to be installed
ubiquitously across land masses, allowing cars, buses, trucks and trains
to power up or send back electricity to the grid. 2. Sensors need to be
embedded in devices across logistics networks to allow factories,
warehouses, wholesalers, retailers and end users to have
up-to-the-moment data on logistical flows that affect their value chain.
3. The storage and transit of all physical goods will need to be
standardized so that they can be efficiently passed off to any node and
sent along any passageway, operating across the logistics system in the
same way that information flows effortlessly and efficiently across the
World Wide Web. 4. All of the operators along the logistics corridors
need to aggregate into collaborative networks to bring all of their
assets into a shared logistical space to optimize the shipment of goods,
taking advantage of lateral economies of scale. For example, thousands
of warehouses and distribution centers might establish cooperatives to
share unused spaces, allowing carriers to drop off and pick up shipments
using the most efficient path on route to their destination. [[The
Internet of Things platform will provide]{.underline}]{.mark} real-time
logistical [[data on pick-up and delivery schedules, weather conditions,
traffic flows and]{.underline}]{.mark} up-to-the-moment [information on
warehouse [storage capacities]{.mark}]{.underline} en route. [[Automated
dispatching will use big data and analytics to create algorithms]{.mark}
and applications [to ensure]{.mark} the optimization of aggregate
[efficiencies]{.mark}]{.underline} along the logistical routes
[[and,]{.mark} by so doing, [dramatically increase productivity while
reducing]{.mark} the [marginal cost]{.mark} of every shipment. [By
2025]{.mark}]{.underline}, at least some of the
[s[hipments]{.mark}]{.underline} on roads, railways and water
[[will]{.underline}]{.mark} likely [[be carried out by
driverless]{.mark} electric and fuel cell [transport, powered by]{.mark}
near zero marginal cost [renewable energies,]{.mark} and operated
by]{.underline} increasingly sophisticated [analytics and
algorithms.]{.underline} Driverless transport will accelerate
productivity and reduce the marginal labor cost of shipping goods toward
near zero on a smart automated Transportation and Logistics Internet.
The erection of the automated Transportation and Logistics Internet also
transforms the very way we view mobility. Today\'s youth are using
mobile communication technology and GPS guidance on an incipient
automated Transportation and Logistics Internet to connect with willing
drivers in car-sharing services. Young people prefer \"access to
mobility\" over ownership of vehicles. Future generations will likely
never own vehicles again in a smart, automated mobility era. Larry
Burns, the former executive vice president of General Motors and now a
professor at the University of Michigan, did a study of mobility
patterns in Ann Arbor, a mid-sized American city, and found that
car-sharing services can reduce the cost of traveling a mile by 80
percent compared to privately owned vehicles. He also found that a
\"shared fleet provides almost instantaneous access to a vehicle with a
fleet of only 15 percent of the number of privately owned vehicles that
would have been used for these trips.\" There are currently at least a
billion cars, buses and trucks crawling along around the world.
Gasoline-powered internal combustion vehicles were the centerpiece of
the Second Industrial Revolution. The mass production of these vehicles
devoured vast amounts of the Earth\'s natural resources. Cars, buses and
trucks also burn massive amounts of oil and are a major contributor to
global warming gas emissions. Burns\' study suggest a [large number of
[vehicles]{.mark} currently on the road are likely to be
eliminated]{.underline} with widespread adoption of car-sharing services
over the course of the next generation. [Those [that remain will
be]{.mark} electric and fuel cell transport, [powered by]{.mark} near
zero marginal cost [renewable energy]{.mark}.]{.underline} Those shared
vehicles, in turn, will be driverless and running on automated, smart
road systems. The long-term transition from ownership of vehicles to
access to mobility in driverless vehicles on smart road systems will
fundamentally alter the business model for the transportation industry.
While the big auto manufacturers around the world will produce fewer
vehicles over the course of the next 30 years, they will likely
increasingly reposition themselves as aggregators of the global
automated Transportation and Logistics Internet, managing mobility
services and logistics. [The convergence of the Communication Internet,
renewable Energy Internet, and automated Transportation and Logistics
Internet]{.underline} in an operating kernel [becomes the global brain
for an Internet of Things]{.underline} cognitive [infrastructure. This
new digital platform]{.underline} fundamentally [changes the way we
manage, power and move economic activity across the numerous value
chains and networks that make up the global economy. The digitalized
Internet of Things platform is the core of the Third Industrial
Revolution.]{.underline} Distributed Manufacturing [Virtually [every
industry will be transformed]{.mark} by the Internet of
Things]{.underline} platform and the ushering in of a Third Industrial
Revolution. For example, a new generation of micro-manufacturers are
beginning to plug in to the incipient Internet of Things and
dramatically increasing their productivity while reducing their marginal
costs, enabling them to outcompete the formerly invincible global
manufacturing firms, which are organized around vertically integrated
economies of scale. It\'s called 3-D printing, and it is the
manufacturing model that accompanies an Internet of Things economy. In
3-D printing, software directs molten feedstock inside a printer to
build up a physical product layer by layer, creating a fully formed
object, even with movable parts, which then pops out of the printer.
Like the replicator in the Star Trek television series, the printer can
be programmed to produce an infinite variety of products. Printers are
already producing products from jewelry and airplane parts to human
prostheses, and even parts of cars and buildings. And cheap printers are
being purchased by hobbyists interested in printing out their own parts
and products. The consumer is beginning to give way to the prosumer as
increasing numbers of people become both the producer and consumer of
their own products. Three-dimensional printing differs from conventional
centralized manufacturing in several important ways. To begin with,
there is little human involvement aside from creating the software. The
software does all the work, which is why it\'s more appropriate to think
of the process as \"infofacture\" rather than \"manufacture.\" The early
practitioners of 3-D printing have made strides to ensure that the
software used to program and print physical products remains open
source, allowing prosumers to share new ideas with one another in
do-it-yourself hobbyist networks. The open design concept conceives of
the production of goods as a dynamic process in which thousands \-- even
millions \-- of players learn from one another by making things
together. The elimination of intellectual property protection also
significantly reduces the cost of printing products, giving the 3-D
printing enterprise an edge over traditional manufacturing enterprises,
which must factor in the cost of myriad patents. The open-source
production model has encouraged exponential growth. The 3-D printing
production process is organized completely differently than the
manufacturing process of the First and Second Industrial Revolutions.
Traditional factory manufacturing is a subtractive process. Raw
materials are cut down and winnowed and then assembled to manufacture
the final product. In the process, a significant amount of the material
is wasted and never finds its way into the end product.
Three-dimensional printing, by contrast, is additive infofacturing.
Software is directing the molten material to add layer upon layer,
creating the product as a whole piece. Additive infofacturing uses
one-tenth of the material of subtractive manufacturing, giving the 3-D
printer a dramatic leg up in efficiency and productivity. 3-D printing
is projected to grow at a blistering rate in the future. 3-D printers
can print their own spare parts without having to invest in expensive
retooling and the time delays that go with it. With 3-D printers,
products can also be customized to create a single product or small
batches designed to order, at minimum cost. Centralized factories, with
their capital-intensive economies of scale and expensive fixed
production lines designed for mass production, lack the agility to
compete with a 3-D production process that can create a single
customized product at virtually the same unit cost as producing 100,000
copies of the same item. Making 3-D printing a truly local,
self-sufficient process requires that the feedstock used to create the
filament is abundant and locally available. Staples \-- the office
supply company \-- has introduced a 3-D printer, manufactured by Mcor
Technologies in its store in Almere, in the Netherlands, that uses cheap
paper as feedstock. The process, called selective deposition lamination,
prints out hard 3-D objects in full color with the consistency of wood.
The 3-D printers are used to \"infofacture\" craft products,
architectural designs and even surgical models for facial
reconstruction. The paper feedstock costs a mere 5 percent of previous
feedstocks. Other 3-D printers are using recycled plastic, paper and
metal objects as feedstock at near zero marginal cost. Someone with a
3-D printer can also power his or her fabrication lab with green
electricity harvested from renewable energy onsite or generated by local
producer cooperatives. Small and medium-sized enterprises in Europe and
elsewhere are already beginning to collaborate in regional green
electricity cooperatives to take advantage of lateral scaling. With the
cost of centralized fossil fuels and nuclear power constantly
increasing, the advantage skews to small and medium-sized enterprises
that can power their factories with renewable energies whose marginal
cost is nearly free. [Marketing costs also plummet in an Internet of
Things economy.]{.underline} The high cost of centralized communications
in both the First and Second Industrial Revolutions \-- in the form of
magazines, newspapers, radio and television \-- meant that only the
bigger manufacturing firms with integrated national operations could
afford advertising across national and global markets, greatly limiting
the market reach of smaller manufacturing enterprises. In the Third
Industrial Revolution, a small 3-D printing operation anywhere in the
world can advertise infofactured products on the growing number of
global Internet marketing sites at nearly zero marginal cost. [Plugging
into an Internet of Things infrastructure at the local level gives the
small infofacturers one]{.underline} final, [critical
advantage]{.underline} over the vertically integrated, centralized
enterprises of the 19th and 20th centuries: [they can power their
vehicles with renewable energy whose marginal cost is nearly free,
significantly reducing their logistics costs along the supply chain and
in the delivery of their finished products to users.]{.underline} The
new 3-D printing revolution is an example of \"extreme productivity.\"
The distributed nature of manufacturing means that anyone and eventually
everyone can access the means of production, making the question of who
should own and control the means of production increasingly irrelevant
for a growing number of goods. Many of Europe\'s global manufacturing
enterprises will continue to flourish, but will be fundamentally
transformed by the democratization of manufacturing, which favors a
high-tech renaissance for small and medium-sized enterprises. Europe\'s
manufacturing giants will increasingly partner with a new generation of
3-D-printing, small and medium-sized enterprises in collaborative
networks. While much of the manufacturing will be done by SMEs that can
take advantage of the increased efficiencies and productivity gains of
lateral economies of scale, the giant enterprises will increasingly find
value in aggregating, integrating and managing the marketing and
distributing of products. [[The peer-to-peer nature of the Internet of
Things]{.mark}]{.underline} platform [[allows millions of disparate
players]{.underline}]{.mark} \-- small and medium-sized businesses,
social enterprises and individuals [\-- [to come
together]{.underline}]{.mark} [and produce and exchange goods and
services directly with one another, [eliminating]{.mark}]{.underline}
the remaining [[middle men]{.mark} that kept marginal costs
high]{.underline} in the Second Industrial Revolution. [**This
fundamental technological transformation** in the way economic activity
is organized and scaled **portends a** great **shift in the flow of
economic power from the few to the multitudes \-- the democratization of
economic life.**]{.underline} It is important to emphasize that the
transition from the Second to the Third Industrial Revolution will not
occur overnight, but, rather, take place of over 30 to 40 years. Many of
today\'s global corporations will successfully manage the transition by
adopting the new distributed and collaborative business models of the
Third Industrial Revolution while continuing their traditional Second
Industrial Revolution business practices. In the coming years,
capitalist enterprises will likely find more value in aggregating and
managing laterally scaled networks than in selling discrete products and
services in vertically integrated markets.

Impact Assessment of Data Localisation conducted by Cuts [on data
localisation impact]{.underline} from the consumer perspective,
consumers perceiving higher risks showed lower levels of data usage.
**[Data localisation, if [implemented, without]{.mark} adequate
[preparation and accountability]{.mark} measures, may reduce freedom of
speech while enhancing risks of censorship, privacy violations, data
breaches and cyber-attacks,]{.underline}** the study said. Data
localisation may "lead to [[loss of international
competitiveness]{.mark} among service providers along with creating a
'honeypot of data' based in a single location and hence [increasing
risks of data breaches and cyber-attacks]{.mark},]{.underline}" Udai S
Mehta, Deputy Executive Director, Cuts International told Financial
Express Online. The [[study]{.mark},]{.underline} which
[[surveyed]{.underline}]{.mark} around [**1,300** users of data-led
services and interacted with 40 [experts in government, legal, service
providers]{.mark}, civil society organisation [and academia,]{.mark}
added that experts were "**[sceptical of]{.mark} the state [having
adequate cyber-security experts and vulnerability proof digital
infrastructure]{.mark} for securing personal data stored within the
country**]{.underline}." The experts also questioned the ability of law
enforcement agencies in fighting cyber crimes even as they stressed on
chances of government's excessive tracking of personal data, said Mehta.
The changes made to the data localisation provisions in the bill last
year from 2018 included non-sensitive and non-critical personal data may
not be stored in India from earlier requirement of storage of a copy all
personal data in India. However, it may be difficult to separately store
different types of personal data, said Cuts. Among other changes, the
2019 bill also expanded the scope of personal data to include online and
offline features potentially increasing the scope of sensitive personal
data and critical personal data. The report also pointed towards the
possible adverse impact on the availability of services and innovation
as data localisation may enhance the costs of operation (due to the need
of setting up data centres in India) to serve Indian consumers. This may
impact small businesses as they may not be able to "justify with respect
to their commercial interests, forcing them to pull out of the Indian
market." Hence, [the [government should "focus on]{.mark} enhancing
consumers [privacy **by avoiding unjustified data access**]{.mark} by
third parties, pruning state exemptions, and making the government's
request for data subject to judicial review. (It should) combat data
breaches and cyber-attacks, prescribe an effective grievance redress
mechanism, and foster data-driven innovation,"]{.underline} the study
recommended. It also suggested a separate policy to incentivise
processing of data in India instead of forced data localisation.

[[The idea that the U.S. is building]{.underline}]{.mark} new low-yield

of the new Nuclear Posture Review.

"[The [people]{.mark} who [say we **lowered the threshold** for the use

saying[,]{.underline} 'but we want these low-yield nuclear weapons [so

at cyber security.' [[That's]{.mark} just [**fundamentally not
true**,]{.mark}]{.underline}["]{.mark} Gen. Paul Selva, vice chairman of
the Joints Chiefs of Staff, said Tuesday at a meeting with reporters.

It's an idea that military leaders have been pushing back against since
the New York Times ran a Jan. 16 story headlined, "Pentagon Suggests
Countering Devastating Cyberattacks With Nuclear Arms."

[When would the U.S. launch a **nuclear attack** in response to a
**non-nuclear event?**]{.underline} The Defense Department says [[the
threshold **hasn't changed** since]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[Obama]{.underline}]{.mark} administration['s]{.underline} [**own
nuclear posture review** in 2010,]{.underline} but a draft of the new
review that leaked online caused a bit of drama in its attempts to
dispel "ambiguity."

The new review gives examples of "non-nuclear strategic attacks," Robert
Soofer, deputy assistant secretary for nuclear and missile defense
policy, told reporters on Thursday. "It could be catastrophic attacks
against civilian populations, against infrastructure. [It could be an
attack using a non-nuclear weapon against our nuclear
command-and-control \[or\] early-warning satellites. But we **don't talk
about cyber**]{.underline}."

In his own conversation with reporters, [Selva broadened "early warning"
systems to include ones that provide "indications of warning that are
important to our detection of an attack."]{.underline} He also
emphasized, "**[We never said 'cyber.']{.underline}**"

There's a reason for that. [[While cyber attacks]{.mark} on physical
infrastructure [can be]{.mark}]{.underline} very [[**dangerous**, they
are **unlikely** to **kill enough people** to provoke a]{.mark} **U.S.
[nuclear response.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

An National Academies of Science and Engineering analysis of the
vulnerability of U.S. infrastructure makes that point. A major cyber
attack could cut off electrical power, resulting in "people dying from
heat or cold exposure, etc.," said Granger Morgan, co-director of the
Carnegie Mellon Electricity Industry Center and one of the chairs of the
report. "A large outage of long duration could cover many states and
last for weeks or longer. Whether and how many casualties there could be
would depend on things like what the weather was during the outage."

It's a huge problem but not an event resulting in tens of thousands of
immediate deaths.

Contrast that with a nuclear attack on a city like Moscow, even one
using a device of 6 kilotons, much smaller than the ones the United
States used against Japanese targets in World War II. The immediate
result: there would be 40,000 deaths, according to the online nuclear
simulation tool NukeMap.

[Russia has demonstrated a willingness to take down power services with
cyber attacks]{.underline}, as they did in Ukraine on Christmas Eve
2015. But these attacks were brief and occured in the context of actual
fighting.

In other words, [[the **worst cyber physical attack**]{.mark} that top

Hypersonic Missile Nonproliferation: Hindering the Spread of a New Class

[To understand the **[implications of hypersonic]{.mark} missile
[proliferation]{.mark}**, it is necessary to understand the
advances]{.underline} these [missiles offer compared with **current
military capabilities**]{.underline}. Hypersonic vehicles have been in
existence since the dawn of the space age. Manned hypersonic air
vehicles were flown over 50 years ago, when the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration (NASA) first flew the X-15 hypersonic test vehicle
in 1959. (Appendix A contains more details about hypersonic flight
vehicles.) The focus of this study, however, is on two new types of
hypersonic vehicles and their constituent enabling technologies: HGVs
and HCMs.

[[The]{.mark} principal [concerns]{.mark}]{.underline} about HGVs and
HCMs [[are]{.mark} the current development efforts]{.underline} by the
major powers (Russia, China, and the United States) [and the potential
[interest by]{.mark} **other [countries to acquire]{.mark} these

[**[exclusively]{.underline}** [affect nations]{.underline}]{.mark}
[that are]{.underline} otherwise [[equipped with]{.mark} **effective
[defenses]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[against]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[ballistic missiles]{.underline}]{.mark}. This may be a substantial
number of nations over the coming decades. The next sections describe
the major advantages and attributes of HGVs and HCMs and their strategic
implications.

Principal Characteristics of HGVs

HGVs are unpowered vehicles that "glide" to their target at the "top" of
the atmosphere, reaching between about 40 km to 100 km in altitude. Even
in this rarified atmosphere, they are designed to produce lift that is
equal to their weight to keep them aloft at hypersonic speeds. A typical
operational concept of an HGV involves launching it on a ballistic
missile and releasing it at the appropriate altitude, velocity, and
flight path angle to enable it to glide to its target. The initial
release conditions are driven by the intended trajectory (downrange and
crossrange) and the characteristics of the vehicle, e.g., lift and drag.
We note that HGV trajectories are very different from maneuvering
reentry vehicles (MaRVs) developed in the past. As Figure 2.1 shows, the
MaRV trajectory is mostly in ballistic mode above 100 km with some
maneuvers executed post-reentry. In contrast, the HGV spends a
negligible portion (if any) of its flight in ballistic mode. The
capabilities of hypersonic missiles give them both offensive and
defensive advantages. From an offensive perspective, maneuverability can
potentially provide HGVs the ability to use in-flight updates to attack
a different target than originally planned (within the reach of the
weapon system) as shown in Figure 1.32 With the ability to fly at
unpredictable trajectories, these missiles will hold extremely large
areas at risk throughout much of their flights. 3 There are also major
defensive differences between MaRVs and HGVs. The post-reentry
high--gforce maneuvers for both missiles would challenge terminal
defenses, but because the majority of the MaRV trajectory is ballistic,
midcourse ballistic missile defense systems that operate in the
exo-atmospheric region remain effective against MaRVs but not against
HGVs. In other words, a MaRV has all the attributes and vulnerabilities
of a ballistic RV with the exception of the post-reentry phase.

Although HGVs are not usually powered, a small propulsion system
providing additional velocity or some attitude or directional control
could also be integrated into the vehicle. However, the value of such an
engine would need to be traded against the costs associated with
additional weight and added complexity.

HGVs as Weapons

Defense Penetration

The trajectory and capabilities of HGVs provide them with some
unprecedented attributes that may be disruptive to current military
doctrines of advanced nations. HGVs have the reach and speed of
ballistic missiles, but, unlike these missiles, they fly at lower
altitudes and have relatively unpredictable trajectories that can
include significant cross-range and terminal maneuvers. These
characteristics make HGVs challenging to defend against because they
tend to fly outside the altitude and speed envelopes of most modern air
and missile defense systems. They can defeat current ballistic missile
defense systems because of their unpredictable long-range trajectories,
maneuverability, and flight altitudes. Terminal air defense systems
would also be challenged by HGVs because of their high speeds and
potential endgame maneuverability. Nations that do not possess advanced
defense systems capable of defending against ballistic missiles would
likely not experience as great a change in threat from these new weapons
because they are already vulnerable to ballistic missiles. The possible
exception is warning time. Hypersonic weapons do substantially increase
the threat for nations with otherwise effective missile defenses.
Hypersonic weapons will not be fielded in quantity for perhaps another
decade, and the proliferation to lesser nations would come later---after
ballistic missile defenses had been improved and more widely deployed.

Compressed Timelines

Nations that do not possess (or have access to) space-based sensor
systems to detect ballistic missile launches and that rely on
ground-based sensors, such as radars, to detect incoming mid- to
long-range ballistic missiles, could experience a further compression of
their decision/ response timelines. The reasoning is that typical
ballistic missiles tend to fly at higher altitudes than HGVs and should
therefore be detectable earlier. Figure 2.2 illustrates this effect. Due
to the Earth's curvature and the HGV's low-gliding altitude as compared
with that of a similar range ballistic missile, radar or other
line-of-site sensors will likely not detect an HGV as early as they
would a ballistic missile. For example, a radar operating from the
surface of a smooth Earth would detect a 3,000-km-range RV about 12
minutes before impact, but would not detect an HGV until about six
minutes before impact. We note that potential defensive systems that
intend to intercept incoming ballistic missiles before they deploy their
payload, e.g., in the boost phase, would retain their effectiveness
against HGV weapons.

Principal Characteristics of HCMs

As the name implies, an HCM is a cruise missile that operates at
hypersonic speeds. As such, it compresses the defense response timeline
and challenges many of the current defense systems because of its high
speed and maneuverability. Hypersonic weapons could be launched from the
ground, from aircraft, or from ships. An HCM would likely accelerate to
around Mach 4 or 5 before an air-breathing engine capable of producing
thrust at hypersonic speeds, e.g., a supersonic combustion ramjet
(scramjet), further accelerates and then maintains the missile's speed.

There are different options for propelling an HCM to Mach 4 or 5, where
the scramjet would take over. Rocket boosters are the most likely option
especially for early generation HCMs, because they offer simplicity and
affordability, although they may be the largest and heaviest option
because they need to carry both their propellant and oxidizer.4 Of
course, any acceleration option must be affordable, because it is a
one-time-use propulsion system. In order to achieve appropriate
pressures for combustion in the scramjet engine, an HCM will likely
cruise at an altitude of 20 to 30 km.

HCMs as Weapons

The principal advantages of an HCM would be its speed and
maneuverability. Combined, these would provide a very responsive and
flexible offensive weapon that could, for example, hold targets within a
1,000-km radius of the launch aircraft at risk and could strike these
targets within several minutes. Cruise missiles are difficult to defend
against because of their unpredictable trajectories. The additional
speed provided by an HCM, relative to other cruise missiles, would
further complicate defense system timelines, as well as potentially be
more effective against kinetic defenses, e.g., missile interceptors.
Compounding the defensive challenges even further, HCMs would fly at
altitudes higher than most current surface-to-air missile systems are
capable of reaching. Defenses could be designed to fly higher, but the
interceptors still would need to confront the HCM's speed and maneu
verability. Furthermore, as described next, an HGV's high kinetic energy
affords significant destructive power, even without, or in addition to,
the destructive power of an explosive warhead.

Destructive Power from High Speed

Hypersonic weapons can deliver nuclear or conventional warheads.
However, another attribute common to both HCMs and HGVs is the potential
to use solely kinetic energy to destroy or damage an unhardened target.
This is made possible by the combination of their high speed, or kinetic
energy, and their accuracy. Their high impact speed can also be
leveraged to help defeat underground facilities.5 Figure 2.3 provides a
rough estimate of the effective explosive TNT equivalence of a
high-speed mass, such as a conventional strike vehicle with no onboard
explosives. The effective TNT equivalence calculation assumed that the
explosive force is directional and focused within the approximate
cross-sectional area of the impacting vehicle.

Summary of Challenges for Defensive Systems

As mentioned previously, speed complements hypersonic missiles'
maneuverability to significantly increase effectiveness. Defenders with
capable terrestrial and space sensors will have only a few minutes to
know these missiles are inbound, and lesser adversaries will likely not
have any significant warning. Given short timelines and high speed, only
very responsive and capable defensive measures would have any chance of
defeating the incoming missiles. This likely means that new, space- or
terrestrial-based area defense systems, such as boost intercept6 or
highly capable midcourse intercept systems,7 would be required. These
types of systems do not currently exist and would require significant
investments to develop and deploy. Advanced terminal (or point) defenses
could provide some effectiveness against these high-speed maneuverable
missiles. However, such point defenses would likely only be deployed to
protect high-value facilities or weapon systems; protecting all
potential targets including civilian facilities could be
costprohibitive. Furthermore, even if a target is equipped with advanced
point defenses such that it is able to defend against an HCM or HGV, it
may still be vulnerable to salvos of such weapons, especially if these
simultaneous attacks use maneuverable vehicles capable of controlling
the timing and direction of the attacks.

Defenders may work to develop directed energy defenses, such as lasers,
but if such systems were terrestrial-based, they would be challenged by
clouds or other atmospheric disturbances and by the need to hit and
destroy fast-maneuvering missiles that are equipped with capable thermal
protection systems. While a laser beam travels at the speed of light,
rendering a near instantaneous time of flight, the beam must dwell
continuously and for a significant length of time on a spot on the
target to destroy it. The hypersonic weapon's thermal protection system
may inherently harden the missile against laser weapons, such that the
required laser spot dwell time may be relatively long to burn through or
sufficiently degrade the thermal protection system (potentially several
tens of seconds or longer).8 Altitude will also contribute to these
missiles' effectiveness, at least in the near term. HCMs will likely be
capable of flying at altitudes between 20 km and 30 km, and HGVs will
fly at altitudes between about 40 km and 100 km. While the HCM's flight
altitudes may be within the upper end of the operating envelope of
today's most capable surface-to-air missiles, the combination of
altitude, maneuverability, and speed would greatly limit the
effectiveness of these defenses. HGVs will fly above the maximum
effective altitudes of most surface-to-air missiles, but very likely
below the altitudes where exo-atmospheric defenses are designed to
intercept inbound RVs.

Long-Term Planning Perspectives for HGV and HCM

Technologies

Both HGVs and HCMs offer advanced warfighting capabilities. However, the
HCM is also an important stepping-stone to larger manned and unmanned
hypersonic vehicles with the potential for military and civilian uses.
Prospective applications include military strike and intelligence,
surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft. Furthermore, these vehicles
will offer the opportunity to test new flight designs under actual
flight conditions. For example, once an HCM is fielded, states will be
less reliant on ground test facilities and computer models. Instead,
test vehicles will be able to investigate different materials, flight
control mechanisms, and flight envelopes under actual flight conditions.
Further, availability of flight test data to calibrate ground test
facilities and computational models will increase greatly.

Strategic Implications of Hypersonic Weapons

Compressed Timelines

The U.S. military uses an acronym to describe the decisionmaking and
action process cycle: OODA (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act). These four
steps take time, and hypersonic missiles compress available response
time to the point that a lesser nation's strategic forces might be
disarmed before acting. As an illustration of the time required to act
with respect to an existential missile threat, the Nuclear Threat
Initiative organization estimated a timeline for a U.S. response to a
massive Russian intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) attack, as
follows:9 • 0 minutes---Russia launches missiles • 1 minute---U.S.
satellite detects missiles • 2 minutes---U.S. radar detects missiles • 3
minutes---North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) assesses
information (2 minutes max) • 4 minutes---NORAD alerts White House • 5
minutes---first detonations of submarine-launched ballistic missiles • 7
minutes---locate president and advisers, assemble them, brief them, get
decision (8 minutes max) • 13 minutes---decision • 15 minutes---transmit
orders to start launch sequence • 20 minutes---launch officers receive,
decode, and authenticate orders • 23 minutes---complete launch sequence
(2 minutes max) • 25 minutes---Russian ICBM detonations.

This timeline is not, of course, representative of two hostile parties
in closer proximity or with less effective warning systems than Russia
and the United States. Nor is it representative of less-than-Armageddon
possibilities. However, for adjacent enemies within a 1,000-km range, a
hypersonic missile traveling at ten times the speed of sound could cover
that distance and reduce response times to about six minutes. 10

Targets

As discussed earlier, [hypersonic missiles increase the threat over
current generations of missiles in cases where the target nation has
**missile defenses**]{.underline}. The targets in such nations would
primarily be high value and heavily defended. [[Prime targets]{.mark}
could [include]{.mark} destroying a nation's]{.underline} **[[leadership
and command and control]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [referred to as
"**decapitation**]{.underline}," to prevent the target nation from
responding with an effective follow-on attack. Other [key targets could
be **[c]{.mark}arrier [s]{.mark}trike [g]{.mark}roups**]{.underline},
[[with]{.mark} the [objective of **striking a**]{.mark} **key
[blow]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[or **pushing**]{.mark} **the [naval
formation further]{.mark} from the coast**]{.underline}. And, [because
of their time sensitivity,]{.underline} [strategic forces and storage
facilities for weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) could warrant
**hypersonic attack**]{.underline}.

**[Implications for Targeted Nations]{.underline}**

[[**Any government** faced with]{.mark} the possibility that
[hypersonic]{.mark} missiles would be employed]{.underline} against
it---[particularly in a **decapitating attack**]{.underline}--- [[would
plan **countermeasures**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [many of [which could
be]{.mark} **[destabilizing]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For example,
[countermeasures could include]{.underline} **[devolution of strategic
forces']{.underline}** [command and control]{.underline} so that [lower
levels of authority could **execute a strategic strike**]{.underline},
[which would]{.underline} obviously [increase]{.underline} the [risk of
**accidental strategic war**]{.underline}; [or strategic forces could be
more widely **dispersed**]{.underline}--- [a tactic risking **greater
exposure to subnational capture**]{.underline}. [[An obvious measure
would be a **launch-on-warning**]{.mark}
**[posture]{.mark}**]{.underline}---[[a hair-trigger tactic that would
increase]{.underline} **[crisis instability]{.underline}**]{.mark}. [Or
the [target nation could adopt]{.mark} a **policy of
[preemption]{.mark}**]{.underline} [during a
crisis]{.underline}---[guaranteeing]{.underline} highly [**destructive**
military action.]{.underline}

To be sure, [[such]{.underline}]{.mark} measures [[could be invoked
against]{.underline} [threats]{.underline} [from
**current**]{.underline} ]{.mark}[types of
[missiles]{.mark}]{.underline}.11 **[[But]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[for
nations with effective]{.mark} ballistic]{.underline} mis sile [and/or
cruise [missile defenses]{.mark}]{.underline} in the time frame [[when
hypersonic]{.underline}]{.mark} [missiles might
[proliferate]{.mark}]{.underline}, the **[[hard choices would be
forced]{.underline}]{.mark}** [when facing **hypersonic**
threats]{.underline}.

Advanced nations with adequate resources could take other steps against
hypersonic threats. They could strengthen the resilience of their
command and control, harden the siting of their strategic forces, and
make a deterrent force mobile or sea-based. These tactics may or may not
be effective, especially for lesser nations. And they certainly will be
expensive---putting them out of reach of some. Even [**[for major
powers]{.mark}**, the [proliferation]{.mark} of hypersonic missiles
[will create]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[new threats]{.underline}** [by
allowing lesser]{.underline}]{.mark} [[powers to hold them at
**risk**]{.underline}]{.mark} [of effective missile attacks]{.underline}
especially [against "unhardened" targets]{.underline}, e.g., cities.
[Over the coming decades[, the ability of a]{.mark} lesser [nation with
a **handful of ICBMs**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[to threaten major
powers]{.mark} [will]{.mark} continue to [decrease]{.mark} as wide area
**[missile defenses]{.mark}** continue to
[improve]{.mark}]{.underline}[. **[However]{.underline}**]{.mark},
[[HGVs]{.mark} and HCMs [will be]{.mark} **more [difficult]{.mark}** [to
defend against]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Implications for Major Powers

[The ability of hypersonic missiles to penetrate **advanced missile
defenses**]{.underline} [will increase the risks for nations with such
defenses]{.underline}. [[**Lesser powers** with hypersonic]{.mark}
weapons [may see]{.mark} these [weapons as a deterrent]{.mark} against
**greater power intervention**]{.underline}, [[and]{.underline} [feel
free to pursue]{.underline}]{.mark} potentially
**[[destabilizing]{.mark} regional [agendas]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Moreover, [lesser nations with **hypersonic missiles**]{.underline}
[could affect the force deployments of major powers]{.underline}. As
noted above, **[[c]{.mark}arrier [s]{.mark}trike
[g]{.mark}roups]{.underline}** [[might be **pushed further out to

Escalation Risks and 'Entanglement' [Many weapons can be employed
for]{.underline} offensive and [**defensive purposes**, but
**[hypersonic]{.mark}**]{.underline} weapon**[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
especially those designed for use in a regional context, [[are]{.mark}

[[to destroy]{.mark} high-value enemy assets, including
**[c]{.mark}ommand-and-[c]{.mark}ontrol
[facilities]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[This raises]{.mark} two major
concerns: [the risk of **rapid escalation**]{.mark} from a **minor**
crisis to a **full-blown war** and the unintended escalation from
**conventional** [to **nuclear war**]{.mark}**fare.**]{.underline} That
hypersonic weapons are being designed for offensive use at an early
stage in a conflict has been evident in U.S. strategic policy from the
beginning. Claiming that a major adversary might try to hide or move
critical assets at the outbreak of a crisis to protect them from U.S.
air and missile strikes, the Pentagon hoped the prompt global-strike
program would enable U.S. forces to attack those targets with minimal
warning. As this program got under way, hypersonic weapons became the
technology of choice for its implementation. "Systems that operate at
hypersonic speeds ... offer the potential for military operations from
longer ranges with shorter response times and enhanced effectiveness
compared to current military systems," states the U.S. Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency. Such munitions, it adds, "could provide
significant payoff for future U.S. offensive strike operations,
particularly as adversaries' capabilities advance."12 Most of the
hypersonic weapons being developed by the U.S. military, including the
Air Force cruise missile and the Navy's sea-launched system, are
intended for strikes against key enemy assets at an early stage of
conflict, when speed confers a significant advantage. Certain Russian
weapons, such as the Kinzhal, also seem intended for this purpose. Some
analysts fear that [[the mere **possession** of such weapons
might]{.mark} induce leaders to escalate a military clash at the very
outbreak of a crisis---believing their early use will confer a
significant advantage in any major engagement that follows---while
**[reduc]{.mark}ing [the chances]{.mark}** [of keeping the fighting
**limited**]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is easy to imagine, for example,
how [a **clash** between U.S. and **Chinese naval vessels**]{.underline}
[in the **South China Sea**]{.underline}, accompanied by signs of an air
and naval mobilization on either or both sides, [might prompt one
combatant to launch a **barrage of [hypersonic
weapons]{.mark}**]{.underline} at all those ships and planes and their
command-and-control systems, hoping to prevent their use in any
full-scale encounter. This might make sense from a military perspective,
but would undoubtedly prompt a fierce counterreaction from the injured
side and restrict efforts to halt the fighting at a lower level of
violence. The introduction of hypersonic weapons also raises concerns
over the escalation from conventional to nuclear warfare. The United
States has focused primarily on the development of hypersonic weapons
carrying conventional warheads, but there is no fundamental reason why
they could not be nuclear armed. Indeed, Russia's Avangard missile is
intended to deliver a nuclear warhead, and it is assumed that China's
DF-ZF is also designed with this in mind. [[This leads to]{.mark} what
is]{.underline} called "**[[warhead ambiguity]{.underline}]{.mark}**":
[the risk that [a **defending nation**]{.mark}, aware of an enemy's
**hypersonic launch** and having **no time** to assess the warhead type,
[will **assume the worst** and **launch**]{.mark}]{.underline} its own
**[[nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark}]{.underline}**.13 Concern over this
risk has led the U.S. Congress to bar funding for the development of
ICBM-launched hypersonic glide vehicles, thereby helping to propel the
Pentagon's shift away from such systems and toward the development of
medium-range weapons more suitable for use in a regional context.
Nevertheless, warhead ambiguity will remain a feature of any future
landscape involving the deployment of multiple hypersonic weapons, as a
defender will never be certain that an enemy's assault is entirely
non-nuclear. [[With]{.underline}]{.mark} as little as [[**five minutes**
to **assess an attack**]{.underline}]{.mark}---[the time it would take a
hypersonic glide vehicle to traverse **2,000**
**miles**]{.underline}---[a defender would be understandably **hard
pressed** to avoid **worst-case assumptions.**]{.underline} Equally
worrisome is the danger of "target ambiguity": the possibility that a
hypersonic attack, even if conducted with missiles known to be armed
only with conventional warheads, would endanger the early-warning and
command-and-control systems a defender uses for its nuclear and
conventional forces, leading it to fear the onset of a nuclear attack.
[This is [especially dangerous in light of]{.mark}]{.underline} what
James Acton, a security analyst at the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace, calls the "**[[entanglement]{.underline}]{.mark}**"
problem. Although almost everything involving nuclear decision-making is
secret, the [**nuclear** and **conventional command-and-control
systems** of the major powers are **widely assumed** to be
**interconnected**, or **entangled**, [making it difficult to]{.mark}
**clearly [distinguish]{.mark}** []{.mark}**one** from
**another**]{.underline}. Therefore, [**any** attack on
command-and-control facilities at the onset of crisis, **however
intended**, could be interpreted by the defender as a prelude to a
**nuclear**]{.underline} rather than a conventional
**[attack]{.underline}** [and prompt the defender to
**launch**]{.underline} its own **[nuclear weapons]{.underline}** before
they are destroyed by an anticipated barrage of enemy bombs and
missiles.14 All this points to yet another concern related to the impact
of emerging technologies on the future battlefield: the risk that
nuclear-armed nations, fearing scenarios of just this sort, will entrust
more and more of their critical decision-making to machines, fearing
that humans will not be able to make reasoned judgments under such
enormous time pressures. With hypersonic weapons in the arsenals of the
major powers, [military leaders may conclude that
sophisticated]{.underline} artificial intelligence
(**[[AI]{.underline}]{.mark}**) **[[systems]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[should be empowered to [determine]{.mark} [the **nature**]{.mark} **of
future missile attacks** and select the **appropriate response**. This
is a temptation that can only increase as hypersonic weapons are
themselves equipped with AI systems]{.underline}, a capability being
developed at Sandia National Laboratories, enabling them to select and
navigate to an array of potential targets.15 This convergence of
advanced technologies is one of the greatest concerns of analysts who
fear the loss of human control over the pace of combat. Paul
[Scharre]{.underline}, a program director at the Center for a New
American Security, [has warned of a "**flash war**"]{.underline}
erupting [when machines **[misinterpret]{.mark}** radar [signals and
initiate]{.mark}]{.underline} catastrophic, possibly **[[nuclear
responses]{.underline}]{.mark}**. "Competitive pressures in fast-paced
environments threaten to push humans further and further out of the
loop," he wrote. "With this arms race in speed come grave risks,"
[including]{.underline} "[a **war** that **spirals out of control** in

In the show of military might Tuesday to celebrate the 70th anniversary
of the People's Republic of **[China]{.underline}**, one of the
[highlight]{.underline}s among the weapons trundling through Tiananmen
Square in Beijing was [a]{.underline} **[hypersonic]{.underline}**
boost-glide **[missile]{.underline}**. The exhibition of 16 DF-17
missiles (or possibly models of the real thing), displayed in public for
the first time, will [probably add to]{.underline}
**[disquiet]{.underline}** [in the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [about]{.underline} a [growing]{.underline}
**[military imbalance]{.underline}**, but that unease should be tempered
by a few practical considerations.

For the past few years, scientists, Pentagon officials and uniformed
military leaders have warned about [China's apparent]{.underline}
**[lead]{.underline}** [in hypersonic technology]{.underline}, [which
they]{.underline} often [describe as a]{.underline}
"**[game]{.underline}** **[changer]{.underline}**." Over the long term,
[hypersonic missiles could]{.underline} indeed [provide
China]{.underline} (and Russia, too) [with a]{.underline} **[uniquely
threatening capability]{.underline}**, but [there is time for a
**considered response**]{.underline}: The DF-17 and its immediate
successors are unlikely to add much, if anything, to China's already
impressive military forces.

To be sure, the DF-17 is a powerful weapon, even armed with a
conventional warhead, as it will be, according to the parade announcer
in Beijing. The missile consists of a rocket that launches a glider,
presumably at more than five times the speed of sound. (That's what
"hypersonic" means.) [The U.S.]{.underline} [intelligence community
reportedly estimates the missile's range at]{.underline} 1,100 to
**[1,550 miles]{.underline}**, and Chinese state media has described it
as being capable of conducting "precision strikes." Not on the U.S.
mainland, though; [Beijing is]{.underline} nearly 6**[,000
miles]{.underline}** [from San Francisco]{.underline}.

But the important question isn't whether the DF-17 poses a danger to
U.S. and allied forces in the western Pacific. It does. Better to ask
whether the DF-17 significantly enhances the threat from China's
formidable arsenal of existing weapons, in particular its force of
between 900 and 1,950 ballistic missiles, most of them conventionally
armed, with ranges of less than 1,850 miles.

There are good reasons to question how much additional capability the
DF-17 will provide. [Chinese ballistic missiles are based on mature
technology, and the Pentagon has determined that they are able to strike
their targets precisely]{.underline}. Chinese propaganda, by contrast,
is the only unclassified source for the accuracy of the
first-of-its-kind DF-17.

Moreover, [hypersonic gliders are]{.underline} actually [at
a]{.underline} **[speed disadvantage]{.underline}** [compared with
ballistic missiles of the same range]{.underline}. Ballistic missiles
are also boosted to high speed by large rockets, before arcing through
the vacuum of space. [A glider, by contrast, spends most of its
trajectory in the atmosphere, using aerodynamic lift to extend its
range]{.underline}. The increased range comes at the cost of faster
deceleration caused by atmospheric friction. [One implication of this
reduced speed is that hypersonic gliders may be more vulnerable to
interception by U.S. "point" missile defenses (especially after such
defenses have been optimized for that purpose). Like cornerbacks in
football, point missile defenses are intended to protect small but
important areas --- such as U.S. military bases in the western
Pacific.]{.underline}

The [main advantage]{.underline} claimed for hypersonic gliders [is
their ability to maneuver]{.underline} during flight. If capable of
adjusting their heading rapidly enough, these gliders could indeed
defeat defenses by dodging interceptors. [But executing rapid maneuvers
without sacrificing the accuracy necessary for military effectiveness
presents a significant technical challenge]{.underline}. [There
is]{.underline} **[no evidence]{.underline}** that [China, or any other
state, has yet surmounted it.]{.underline}

That said, [hypersonic]{.underline} weapons do present a serious
challenge for the United States --- but the [threat]{.underline} is
**[likely to emerge slowly.]{.underline}**

Despite Russia's overall inaccuracy in firing all of its missiles, John

sobering reality" is that the estimated 1,500 missiles Russia has fired
since the Feb. 24 invasion targeted Ukrainian civilians.

fellow at the Hoover Institution, and a member of the President\'s
Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board and Science Advisory Committee. The
Nuclear Enterprise, High-Consequence Accidents: How to Enhance Safety
and Minimize Risks in Nuclear Weapons and Reactors, pg. 1-3

[We live in [dangerous times]{.mark} for many reasons. [**Prominent
among them** is the existence of]{.mark}]{.underline} a global nuclear
enterprise made up of weapons that can cause damage of unimaginable
proportions and [[power plants at which accidents can have
**severe**]{.underline}]{.mark}, essentially [**[unpredictable
consequences for human life]{.mark}**.]{.underline} For all of its
utility and promise, [the nuclear enterprise is unique in the enormity
of the **[vast quantities of destructive energy that can be released
through blast, heat, and radioactivity.]{.mark}**]{.underline} We
addressed just this subject in a conference in October 2011 at Stanford
University\'s Hoover Institution. The complete set of papers prepared
for the conference is reproduced in this book. The conference included
experts on weapons, on power plants, on regulatory experience, and on
the development of public perceptions and the ways in which these
perceptions influence policy7. The reassuring outcome of the conference
was a general sense that the U.S. nuclear enterprise currently meets
very high standards in its commitment to safety and security. That has
not always been the case in all aspects of the nuclear enterprise. And
the unsettling outcome of the conference was that it will not be the
case globally unless governments, international organizations,
industry7, and media recognize and address the nuclear challenges and
mounting risks posed by a rapidly changing world. The acceptance of the
nuclear enterprise is now being challenged by concerns about the
questionable safety and security of programs primarily in countries
relatively new to the nuclear enterprise, and the potential loss of
control to terrorist or criminal gangs of fissile material that exists
in such abundance around the world. In a number of countries, confidence
in nuclear energy production was severely shaken in the spring of 2011
by the Fukushima nuclear reactor plant disaster. And in the military
sphere, the doctrine of deterrence that remains primarily dependent on
nuclear weapons is seen in decline due to the importance of non-state
actors such as al Qaeda and terrorist affiliates that seek destruction
for destruction\'s sake. We have two nuclear tigers by the tail. [When
[risks]{.mark} and consequences [are]{.mark} unknown,
[undervalued]{.mark}, or ignored, **our nation and [the world are
dangerously vulnerable]{.mark}**[. Nowhere is this]{.mark}
risk-consequence equation [more relevant than with]{.mark} respect to
the nucleus of [the atom]{.mark}.]{.underline} The nuclear enterprise
was introduced to the world by the shock of the devastation produced by
two atomic bombs hitting Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Modern nuclear weapons
are far more powerful than those early bombs, which presented their own
hazards. Early research depended on a program of atmospheric testing of
nuclear weapons. In the early years following World War II, the impact
and the amount of radioactive fallout in the atmosphere generated by
above-ground nuclear explosions was notfully appreciated. During those
years, the United States and also the Soviet Union conducted several
hundred tests in the atmosphere that created fallout. The recent
Stanford conference focused on a regulatory weak point from that time
that exists in many places today, as the Fukushima disaster clearly
indicates. The U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) was initially
assigned conflicting responsibilities: to create an arsenal of nuclear
weapons for the United States to confront a growing nuclear-armed Soviet
threat; and, at the same time, to ensure public safety from the effects
of radioactive fallout. The AEC was faced with the same conundrum with
regard to civilian nuclear power generation. It was charged with
promoting civilian nuclear power and simultaneously protecting the
public. Progress came in 1963 with the negotiation and signing of the
Limited Test Ban Treaty (LTBT) banning all nuclear explosive testing in
the atmosphere (initially by the United States, the Soviet Union, and
the United Kingdom). With the successful safety7 record of the U.S.
nuclear weapons program, domestic anxiety about nuclear weapons receded
somewhat. Meanwhile, public attitudes toward nuclear weapons reflected
recognition of their key role in establishing a more stable nuclear
deterrent posture in the confrontation with the Soviet Union. The
positive record on safety of the nuclear weapons enterprise in the
United States---there have been accidents involving nuclear weapons, but
none that led to the release of nuclear energy---was the result of a
strong effort and continuing commitment to include safety as a primary
criterion in new weapons designs, as well as careful production,
handling, and deployment procedures. The key to the health of today\'s
nuclear weapons enterprise is confidence in the safety7 of its
operations and in the protection of special nuclear materials against
theft. One can imagine how different the situation would be today if
there had been a recognized theft of material sufficient for a bomb, or
if one of the two four-megaton bombs dropped from a disabled B-52
Strategic Air Command bomber overflying Goldsboro, North Carolina, in
1961 had detonated. In that event, just one switch in the arming
sequence of one of the bombs, by remaining in its \"off position\" while
the aircraft was disintegrating, was all that prevented a full-yield
nuclear explosion. A close call indeed! In the twenty-six years since
Chernobyl, the nuclear power industry has strengthened its safety
practices. Over the past decade, growing concerns about global warming
and energy independence have actually strengthened support for nuclear
energy in the United States and many nations around the world. Yet
despite these trends, [the civil nuclear enterprise remains
fragile]{.underline}. Following Fukushima, opinion polls gave stark
evidence of the public\'s deep fears of the invisible force of nuclear
radiation, shown by public opposition to the construction of new nuclear
power plants in close proximity. It is not simply a matter of getting
better information to the public but of actually educating the public
about the true nature of nuclear radiation and its risks. Of course, the
immediate task of the nuclear power component of the enterprise is to
strive for the best possible safety record with one overriding
objective: no more Fukushimas. Another issue that must be resolved
involves the continued effectiveness of a policy of deterrence that
remains primarily dependent upon nuclear weapons, and the hazards these
weapons pose due to the spread of nuclear technology and material. There
is growing apprehension about the determination of terrorists to get
their hands on weapons or, for that matter, on the special nuclear
material---plutonium and highly enriched uranium---that fuels them in
the most challenging step toward developing a weapon. [The global
effects of a regional war between nuclear-armed adversaries such as
India and Pakistan]{.underline} would also [wield an enormous
impact]{.underline}, potentially [involving [radioactive fallout]{.mark}
at large distances caused by a limited number of nuclear explosions.
**This [is true as well for nuclear radiation from a reactor
explosion]{.mark}**[---fallout at large distances would have a
serious]{.mark}]{.underline} societal [[impact]{.underline}]{.mark} on
the nuclear enterprise. [There is little understanding of the reality
and potential danger of consequences if such an event were to
occur]{.underline} halfway around the world. An effort should be made to
prepare the public by providing information on how to respond to such an
event.

#### Extinction

Dave **Hodges 19**---Editor and Host of The Common Sense Show,
internally citing Judy Haar, a recognized expert in nuclear plant
failure analyses AND a source at the Palo Verde Nuclear power plant,

An Extinction Level Event (Part One)", The Common Sense Show,

A more detailed analysis reveals that the spent fuel pools carry
depleted fuel for the reactor. Normally, this spent fuel has had time to
considerably decay and therefore, reducing radioactivity and heat.
However, the newer discharged fuel still produces heat and needs
cooling. Housed in high density storage racks, contained in buildings
that vent directly into the atmosphere, radiation containment is not
accounted for with regard to the spent fuel racks. In other words, there
is no capture mechanism. In this scenario, accompanied by a lengthy
electrical outage, and with the emergency power waning due to either
generator failure or a lack of diesel needed to power the generators,
the [plant could lose the ability to provide cooling. The **[water
will]{.mark} subsequently [heat up]{.mark}**[, **boil away** and
**uncover**]{.mark} **the [spent fuel rods]{.mark}**]{.underline} which
required being covered in at least 25 feet of water to remain benign
from any deleterious effects. Ultimately, [[this would lead to
**fires**]{.mark} as well [and]{.mark} the [**release of radioactivity**
into the atmosphere. This would be the **beginning** of **another
Fukushima**]{.mark} event]{.underline} right here on American soil. Both
my source and Haar shared exactly the same scenario about how a meltdown
would occur. Subsequently, I spoke with Roger Landry who worked for
Raytheon in various Department of Defense projects for 28 years, many of
them in this arena and Roger also confirmed this information and that
the above information is well known in the industry.

Now that the danger is exposed, let\'s ask the earthquake question. When
the Canadian Subduction Zone goes critical, this will cause a loss of
power. Will the power be restored in 7-30 days, which is the time that
all nuclear power plants are designed to be offline and still meet the
cooling of the fuel rods question? The answer is frightening. If power
is not restored, and that is assuming the structure of the plant is
still intact following the earthquake, the authorities would have 1-4
weeks to restore power, at most.

In conclusion, we must face the possibility that when we mix in nuclear
power plants with the Cascadian Subduction Zone event, [we [are facing
an **extinction level event**. Through]{.mark} the presence of
[**multiple nuclear power plant failures**, **all life on the planet
will**]{.mark} **eventually [be put at
risk]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline}

With our intelligence we have littered the planet with massive spent
[[nuclear fuel]{.underline}]{.mark} pools, [emitting]{.underline}
**[lethal radiation]{.underline}** in over-crowded conditions, [with
circulation requirements of **electricity**]{.underline},
**[water]{.underline}**-supply, [and]{.underline} neutron [**absorbent

of these conditions for any calculable or incalculable reason, [will
[release]{.mark}]{.underline} all of [a pool's
**[cesium]{.mark}**]{.underline} [in[**to** the
**atmosphere**]{.mark}]{.underline}, causing 188 square miles to be
contaminated, 28,000 cancer deaths and \$59 billion in damage. As of
2003, 49,000 tons of SNF was stored at 131 sites with an additional
2,000-2,400 metric tons produced annually. The NRC has issued permits,
and the nuclear industry has amassed unfathomable waste on the premise
that a deep geological storage facility would be available to remediate
the waste. The current chances for a deep geological storage facility
look grim. The NAS has required geologic stability for 1,000,000 years.
It is impossible to calculate any certainty 1,000,000 years into the
future. Humanity could not even predict the mechanical failures at Three
Mile Island or Chernobyl, nor could it predict the size of the tsunami
that triggered three **[criticality]{.underline}** [events]{.underline}
at Fukushima Daiichi. These irremediable crises span just over 70 years
of human history.

How [can]{.underline} the continued production and maintenance of SNF in
pools [be]{.underline} anything but [a]{.underline}
**[precedent]{.underline}** [to [an **unprecedented human
cataclysm**]{.mark}]{.underline}? The Department of Energy's outreach
website explains nuclear fission for power production, providing a
timeline of the industry. The timeline ends, as does most of the world's
reactor construction projects in the 1990s, with the removal of the FCMs
from Three Mile Island. One would think the timeline would press into
the current decade, however the timeline terminates with the question,
"How can we minimize the risk? What do we do with the waste?" (The
History of Nuclear Energy 12). Nearly fifteen years into the future,
these questions are no closer to an answer. The reactors at Fukushima
Daiichi are still emitting radioisotopes into the atmosphere, and their
condition is unstable. TEPCO has estimated it could take forty years to
recover all of the fuel material, and there are doubts as to whether the
decontamination effort can withstand that much time (Schneider 72). A
detailed analysis of Chernobyl has demonstrated that [nuclear
fall-out]{.underline}, whether from thermonuclear explosions, spent fuel
pool fires, or reactor core criticality events [are [deleterious
to]{.mark} the **[food]{.mark}-chain**]{.underline}.
**[Cesium]{.underline}** and strontium [are taken into the **roots** of
**plants**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[food]{.underline}** crops,
[causing [direct]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[human]{.underline}**]{.mark}
[and]{.underline} **[animal]{.underline}** [[contamination]{.mark} from
ingestion, causing cancer, teratogenicity, mutagenesis [and
death]{.mark}. Vegetation suffers mutagenesis, reproductive loss, and
death. Radioactive [fields and **forest**]{.mark} floor[**s**
**decimate** **invertebrate**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[and]{.underline}
**[rodent variability]{.underline}**]{.mark} [and number [necessary
to]{.mark} supply [nature's]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[food-chain]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[life
[cycles]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [The **flesh and bones**]{.underline}
[of freshwater and oceanic biota contribute significantly to the total
radiation dose in the food-chain. [Fresh **water**]{.mark}
**lakes**]{.underline}, **[rivers]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[streams]{.underline}** [[become radioactive]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Potable **[aquafers]{.underline}** directly underlying SNFs and FCMs
[are penetrated by downward migration of radioisotopes]{.underline}.
**[Humans must eat to live. Humans must have water. [No human can
survive]{.mark} 5 Sv of exposure]{.underline}** to ionizing radiation,
many cannot survive exposure to 1 Sv.

Realizing the irremediable devastation caused by one thermonuclear
warhead, by one Chernobyl, by one Fukushima Daiichi, it remains to be
said that [the]{.underline} **[earth]{.underline}** [can handle as many
simultaneous loss of coolant failures as nature can create]{.underline}.
**[Humanity cannot]{.underline}**. It is not good enough to lead by
relegating probable human wide extinction phenomena to an appeal to lack
of evidence. [Policy]{.underline} **[cannot]{.underline}** indefinitely
**[ignore]{.underline}** responsibility by requiring further study. Nor
can leadership idle into **[cataclysm]{.underline}** by relying on the
largest known natural phenomena of the last 200 years. Permitting
construction and continued operation of malefic machinery, based on 200
years of cataclysmic experience is a protocol for calamity. Of coronal
mass ejections, Hapgood warns, that we need to prepare for a
once-in-1000-year event, not just simulate infrastructure safeties by
the measure of what we have seen in the past. The same is true for all
natural phenomena. The future of humanity is too precious to operate
with such insouciance. The engineering is not good enough. It never will
be. Nature is too unpredictable, and nuclear power is too dangerous.

Response to Encourage Nuclear Energy Development," Arizona State Law

Although these events are significant, this Comment\'s thesis remains.
If anything, [the current economic and political situation heightens the
need for alternative energy.]{.underline} The nuclear genie is out of
the bottle, and countries\' quests for nuclear weapons are inevitable.
This quest will continue with or without nuclear energy. [Policymakers
and the nuclear industry must encourage nuclear development in a
cautious and transparent way, ensuring safe domestic development and
responsible international leadership. The stakes are too high to abandon
nuclear energy]{.underline} immediately: [[Nuclear power]{.mark} is
essential to environmental protection and economic sustainability, but
the **industry [requires strong governmental
support]{.mark}**]{.underline} to spur nuclear power\'s development.
Furthermore, these events do not appear to have dissuaded the nuclear
industry, as nuclear power seems primed for a revival. n8 For the first
time in several decades, energy companies are pursuing nuclear energy,
waiting to build new power plants as soon as construction becomes
affordable. n9 [This]{.underline} \[\*317\] [[revival]{.mark}, however,
[depends on]{.mark} the proper [governmental support]{.mark}.
n10]{.underline} One recently-proposed support would have the federal
government guarantee up to \$ 122 billion in loans for nuclear power
plant construction, which would lower the perceived financial risk
involved in alternative energy investment. n11 Particularly given
current economic conditions, policymakers should consider loan
guarantees as part of a multi-faceted nuclear power development
strategy. Loan guarantees alone, however, should not be the sole
instrument by which to encourage nuclear energy. Fossil fuel regulation
must also occur to help make nuclear power economically competitive and
profitable for investors in the short-term, regardless of whether loan
guarantees lessen investment risk. Government also must take steps to
give nuclear power the same treatment other alternative energies
receive. Including nuclear power in renewable portfolio standards and
lowering nuclear power licensing costs would be two important steps to
that end. I. The Changing Energy Economy Few deny that
[[today\'s]{.mark} energy [economy]{.mark} is rapidly changing -
increasing oil and natural gas prices, instability in
fossil-fuel-supplier nations, and uncertainty about various energy
sources\' feasibility [put the nation at an energy
crossroad]{.mark}]{.underline}. Some feel comfortable leaving our energy
future to the free market, letting circumstances decide which energy
technology carries (or drops) the nation through the rest of the
twenty-first century. Another view looks beyond the free market, holding
that the changing global energy economy provides only the backdrop for
the broad-sweeping changes that assertive action could establish. For
decades, scholars have commented extensively on this changing global
energy economy. More recently, however, scholarly concerns have become a
mainstay in public discourse as well - soaring oil and natural gas
prices, the Iraq War, and even Al Gore\'s An Inconvenient Truth n12 have
reified the nation\'s energy concerns. n13 [This renewed public
interest]{.underline} n14 [gives]{.underline} \[\*318\] [policymakers a
unique opportunity either to take advantage of this inertia, carefully
crafting a solvent energy policy, or to allow the unpredictable market
to choose the direction itself.]{.underline} Policymakers must choose
the former. As this Comment will show, many energy sources have the
opportunity to come to the forefront; only an active strategy ensures
the proper energy sources carry us into the latter part of this century.
These many energy options span the spectrums of cheap to expensive,
clean to dirty, efficient to inefficient, popular to unpopular, and
feasible to unfeasible. They include, among others: Oil, natural gas,
coal and clean coal, solar, hydro, wind, geothermal, ethanol, biofuel,
hydrogen, and nuclear. Of all these options, nuclear energy is essential
to carry the nation into the next energy economy. For the first time in
over thirty years, nuclear energy is primed for a potential renaissance.
Although the last United States nuclear plant currently in operation was
ordered in 1973, and although nuclear power has failed to emerge as a
dominant energy source, n15 some predict nuclear energy could be ready
for a revival. n16 With the growing cost of energy, the increased
awareness of nuclear power\'s environmental safety, and nuclear
\[\*319\] power\'s historically safe n17 and efficient performance, n18
nuclear energy has a window of opportunity to grow. However, this
potential renaissance will not occur without a strong governmental
commitment to the nuclear industry. [[Despite nuclear energy\'s
long-term]{.mark} economic [benefits, **capital costs and regulatory
requirements thwart**]{.mark} **nuclear power\'s [continued
development]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Thus, [policymakers must compensate
for nuclear power\'s artificially high short-term costs and procedural
requirements]{.underline}. While several policy options to encourage
nuclear power exist, Congress should avoid the political temptations to
focus on only one of several options or to give only facial support to
the nuclear industry. Rather, policymakers must take a strong policy
stance, combining regulations and incentives, to encourage nuclear power
development. This should include a combination of several governmental
actions: placing a hard cap on fossil fuel emissions, which would make
alternative energy economically competitive with fossil fuels in the
short term; allowing businesses to include nuclear energy as a
\"renewable energy\" for purposes of renewable portfolio standards
(\"RPS\"); providing additional tax credits for nuclear power
development, which would allow businesses to overcome nuclear plants\'
high capital construction expenses; and lowering the artificially high
licensing and approval costs, which would help decrease the capital cost
and time required for new nuclear power plants. [This combination of
strong policy options would make nuclear energy more economically viable
in the shortterm, allowing nuclear power\'s long-term efficiency to
replace fossil fuels.]{.underline} Although this Comment\'s purpose is
not to fully examine the benefits and detriments of various energy
options, a brief discussion of some of the energy sources that could be
relevant in the coming decades contextualizes the energy economy and
policy alternatives. Therefore, this Comment begins by analyzing the
fossil fuel energy economy, concluding that its economic and
environmental implications make the current energy path unsustainable.
The Comment then discusses renewable energy as a possible alternative;
although renewable energies are often seen as the energies of the
future, they alone cannot meet United States energy demand in a
cost-efficient manner. The next analysis focuses on nuclear power as the
best combination of environmental friendliness and economic feasibility.
This section concludes that nuclear energy should be an important part
of the next energy economy because it provides the best opportunity for
long-term \[\*320\] economic and environmental sustainability. The
Comment concludes by discussing some of the proposed methods for
increasing nuclear power and by recommending a fossil fuel emissions
cap, nuclear power\'s inclusion in renewable portfolio standards, and
eased licensing and capital requirements. Such a combination strategy
could help create an equal playing field, allowing nuclear power to
become a substantial energy source for the coming energy economy. II.
Today\'s Non-Nuclear Energy Options Fossil fuels dominate today\'s
energy economy. Eighty-five percent of United States energy, including
two-thirds of the electricity sector, is produced from fossil fuels,
such as coal, oil, and natural gas. n19 In contrast, renewable energies,
such as wind, solar, hydro, geothermal, and biomass, comprise only about
seven percent of the energy sector. n20 Nuclear currently comprises
approximately twenty percent of the electricity sector, far below its
overall future generating capacity. n21 Fossil fuel emissions have two
main negative environmental impacts: pollution, which causes health
problems and environmental damage, and [[global
warming]{.underline}]{.mark}, which [[has]{.underline}]{.mark}
broad-reaching and [potentially [apocalyptic
implications]{.mark}]{.underline}. n22 Although pollution\'s harmful
effects often go unnoticed due to their systemic nature, air pollution
presents serious problems. Estimates \[\*321\] predict worldwide
pollution kills tens or even hundreds of thousands each year and puts
millions more at risk through heart disease, respiratory conditions,
mercury poisoning, and even ecosystem collapse. n23 If pollution is the
silent killer, global warming may be the slightly longer-term, yet
ultimately more dangerous, foe. Rising [[sea levels]{.mark}, giant
storms, droughts, ice ages, heat waves, [crop failures,]{.mark} disease,
[and]{.mark} plant and animal [species loss]{.mark} are just some of the
possible impact scenarios]{.underline}. n24 [[Any one of]{.mark} these
scenarios, at its most dangerous level, [has the potential to alter
life]{.mark} on the planet [permanently]{.mark}]{.underline} and beyond
recognition. Furthermore, [[experts predict]{.mark} that global [warming
may rear its head sooner rather than later]{.mark}]{.underline}. n25 By
some estimates, [the planet has already begun to experience climate
change\'s impact, making quick and effective energy policy changes
essential]{.underline}. This section analyzes coal, oil, natural gas,
and renewable energy sources in the face of the urgent need for energy
policy change. A. Coal [Each fossil fuel energy source also has its
individual harms. Coal is the most popular electricity
source]{.underline} in the United States, accounting for over fifty
percent of the country\'s electricity. n26 Unfortunately, coal is also
the dirtiest and most environmentally harmful energy source. Coal plants
produce carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and other emissions that
accumulate \[\*322\] in the upper atmosphere, breathing air, water, and
soil. n27 Specifically, coal plants produce approximately three-fifths
of U.S. sulfur dioxide emissions, one-third of mercury emissions,
one-quarter of nitrogen oxide emissions, and one-third of carbon dioxide
air emissions. n28 Of all energy sources, therefore, coal contributes to
global warming and pollution\'s environmental and health concerns to the
greatest degree. Even \"clean coal\" technology, meant to reduce
emissions or increase efficiency, is simply an ineffective misnomer. n29
First, businesses have not implemented clean coal on a wide scale
because they lack strong immediate incentives or obligations to do so
and because the technology is not substantially developed, leaving any
potential positive impact very speculative. n30 In fact, the Department
of Energy recently cancelled FutureGen, a new clean coal research plant,
in favor of \"younger, cheaper and disappointing alternatives.\" n31
Even when implemented, clean coal does not substantially decrease
harmful emissions, but instead acts as a small band-aid to coal\'s
systematic pollution problem. n32 In fact, even the most advanced clean
coal technology realistically can provide no more than forty-three
percent power plant efficiency; even this optimum level of efficiency
releases huge amounts of harmful emissions. n33 \[\*323\] B. Oil Oil
provides a smaller portion of the nation\'s electricity supply than coal
does, but nonetheless is a major energy source and presents both extreme
environmental and economic concerns. n34 Oil is the largest overall
energy source in the United States, although its share of the
electricity grid is smaller than its share in the transportation or home
heating sectors. n35 [Environmentally, oil creates large amounts of
greenhouse gases and other pollutants that cause the pollution and
global warming discussed above.]{.underline} n36 Other environmental
risks from oil stem from its shipment and pipeline transportation. n37
Oil pipeline leaks pose environmental risks if oil flows from the pipes
to the soil or water sources. n38 Oil tanker leaks or accidents also
risk releasing millions of gallons of dangerous oil, threatening both
wildlife and plant life. n39 Additionally, the oil economy threatens
American and global security in several ways. First, oil-exporting
countries use their trade positions to constrain American foreign policy
objectives. n40 The United States must carefully frame its foreign
policy such that it does not upset oil markets. n41 As long as the
United States relies so heavily on oil, it must pay credence to those
who control the oil supply, effectively giving both friendly and hostile
nations a critical bargaining chip. n42 Second, oil [[dependency may
create **conflict between oil purchasers**, who must compete for]{.mark}
the planet\'s [limited supply]{.mark}]{.underline}; namely, [oil could
[**strain relations** between the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[and]{.mark} the emerging economies of **[China and
India]{.mark}**]{.underline}, all [of whom must power
growing]{.underline} \[\*324\] industrialized societies. n43 In other
words, as fossil fuel demand continues to outpace supply, this
limited-resource economy inevitably creates conflict, whether military
or otherwise. n44 Third, oil [dependency forces the United States to
mortgage its energy future on volatile regions of the world, such as the
Middle East, South Asia, and South America]{.underline}. n45 Such
reliance allows regional instability to threaten United States oil
supply and may even force the United States into conflict simply to
protect its oil assets. Furthermore, although the average American
likely sees rising gasoline prices as a harbinger of economic problems
caused by oil\'s limited supply, the actual economic impact of declining
oil supply will extend far beyond the gas pumps. Dangerously, this
[[economic collapse will come sooner, rather than later, as peak oil
approaches]{.underline}]{.mark} in the coming decades. n46 Even the last
remaining oil is largely unavailable, because cost, technological, and
political barriers prevent its use; remaining oil in other words, is
only \"theoretical.\" n47 Peak oil is the point at which global oil
output reaches its maximum, the point at which the rate of production
enters a terminal decline. n48 At this point, oil [prices rise at an
exponential and unstoppable rate because global supply cannot meet
demand]{.underline}. n49 Peak oil would have an economic ripple effect
\"that would make 1929 look like a dress rehearsal and could touch off a
deperate and probably violent contest for whatever oil supplies
remained.\" n50 The rising price of oil is already impacting the economy
in nearly all sectors - transportation, electricity, manufacturing. n51
Anticipated higher prices would force businesses either to endure the
costs or to pass the costs on to consumers. n52 In either event, the
wide-ranging economic effect would be devastating beyond recovery. Until
this economic crash occurs, oil will continue to destroy the environment
by depositing dangerous emissions into the atmosphere. As with coal, oil
contributes strongly to pollution and global warming, risking extreme
environmental damage to the planet and endangering populations\'
well-being. n53 Whether oil\'s legacy is systemic environmental and
health \[\*325\] damage or an eventual economic or planetary collapse,
oil is ultimately unsustainable. C. Natural Gas Natural gas was once
hailed as a \"bridge fuel\", an energy source that could transition the
energy economy toward an emissions-free system, but this promise was
never fulfilled. n54 Natural gas is cleaner than coal and oil, and its
peak is, by some estimates, less pressing than that of oil. n55
Nonetheless, honoring natural gas as an energy solution is like
appreciating the frying pan vis-a-vis the fire. Ultimately, natural gas
is still a limited fossil fuel resource, meaning it raises the same
major concerns that oil does: It produces harmful emissions that
contribute to global warming and it risks economic and political
instability as global demand continues to outpace supply. n56 [Natural
gas]{.underline} also [carries additional dangers related to its
transportation]{.underline}. Namely, natural gas\'s flammability makes
natural gas [tankers a prime target for terrorist attacks]{.underline}.
n57 A well-placed explosive [could create a blast with fifty-five times
the energy of the nuclear bomb detonated on Hiroshima.]{.underline} n58
With natural gas tankers docking in highly-populated harbor cities like
New York or Boston, the casualty count of such an attack could easily
number in the thousands, if not millions. n59 Finally, in addition to
the terrorist risks associated with transportation, natural gas tankers
inherently pose a serious environmental risk; the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission\'s failure to address such environmental concerns
has left precious habitats, such as Mount Hope and the Taunton River,
permanently damaged. n60 \[\*326\] D. Renewable Energies Aside from
fossil fuels, a number of alternative sources produce a portion of the
nation\'s energy. These include, among others, wind, solar, hydro,
geothermal, biofuel, and ethanol. Unlike natural gas, these alternatives
would be welcome because, for the most part, they create less
environmental damage. n61 However, renewable energies are, at least for
the foreseeable future, not technologically developed enough for
policymakers to consider them as a viable solution alone. At their
current levels, these alternatives can meet only a small portion of the
nation\'s energy demand and are unlikely to provide more than twenty
percent of U.S. energy consumption. n62 [Renewable energies also operate
at a much higher cost than that of fossil fuels or nuclear power,
creating an economic drain]{.underline} due to its use and a business
disincentive to invest in the technologies. n63 Even more discouraging,
some \"renewable\" energy sources, such as ethanol and biodiesel,
actually waste more energy than they produce. n64 Accounting for the
energy costs of producing the crop and converting the crop to a usable
energy resource, the overall energy loss ranges from just under thirty
percent for corn and soybean energy, to 118% for sunflower energy. n65
In addition, technologies must advance not only to improve efficiency,
but also to compensate for the geographical fact that certain energies
are impractical in certain areas. n66 For example, solar power is
impractical in the \[\*327\] Pacific Northwest, while hydropower and
wind power are impractical in the Southwest. Furthermore, given the
relative inefficiency of each renewable unit, the land area and
construction required to provide a substantial power source would
overburden states. n67 \"Building enough wind farms, damming enough
rivers, and growing enough biomass to meet global energy demands
\[would\] wreck the environment.\" n68 For example, wide-scale economic
and environmental impacts would result if the United States developed
enough new wind turbines to provide substantial energy. n69 Such a
large-scale commitment is geographically, aesthetically,
environmentally, and economically unreasonable. In a vacuum, long-term
feasibility and efficiency problems would be less of a concern; society
could wait until the technology developed further. Certainly, renewable
energies can and should play an important role in an interwoven energy
economy. n70 However, today\'s energy economy does not exist in a
vacuum. With fossil fuel use creating continual environmental damage and
looming economic downfall, society does not have the luxury of waiting
until alternative energies develop sufficiently. The issue becomes more
time-sensitive each day, as [global energy demand continues to outpace
supply. Renewable energies may be a welcome addition to a diversified
energy economy, but the country cannot exclusively rely on renewable
sources]{.underline} to solve the economic and environmental problems of
fossil fuels. III. Why the Nuclear Option? A. Nuclear Power\'s Viability
[**[Nuclear energy is the only alternative]{.mark}** that combines
current economic viability with environmental protection]{.underline}.
Skeptics note that nuclear energy accounts for only about twenty percent
of the nation\'s energy and that no nuclear plants currently in use have
been ordered since 1973. n71 However, \[\*328\] these disappointing
facts indicate only a historical lack of political support and capital
construction initiative. As other energies become decreasingly
economical and as the public becomes more supportive of alternative
energy, alternative energies, such as nuclear energy, become prime
targets for expansion. With nuclear plants\' high energy capacity and
operating efficiency, nuclear power could fill the energy demand
currently met by fossil fuels, thus lowering the adverse economic and
environmental impacts that coal, oil, and natural gas present.
Currently, 104 licensed nuclear power plants exist in the United States,
producing over 95,000 net megawatts of electricity. n72 Additionally,
although new plants have not been built, nuclear plants are becoming
more efficient, improving nuclear power\'s capability to meet the
nation\'s energy demand. n73 Even without the benefit of strong
governmental support, the nuclear industry has already proven its
capacity to comprise a large portion of the nation\'s energy. In the
electricity sector, expanded nuclear power could quickly displace coal,
oil, and natural gas. n74 Even given decades of public and governmental
admonishment, nuclear power still comprises about twenty percent of the
nation\'s energy consumption. n75 Nuclear energy\'s true potential could
be realized by building new nuclear power plants, which could compensate
for growing energy demand, especially given today\'s efficiency
standards. Furthermore, unlike renewable energies, nuclear power\'s high
generating capacity means that nuclear power can provide a major portion
of the country\'s energy in only a few square miles, avoiding costly
expansion over large areas of land. n76 \[\*329\] In addition to its
\"land efficiency,\" nuclear power has extremely cost-efficient
operation. For example, even accounting for the costs of uranium
enrichment, management, and disposal, the average nuclear power plant is
approximately three times more cost-efficient than a typical coal plant.
n77 Nuclear power technology also continually improves, such as with
power uprates, n78 new fuels, n79 or other methods of improving power
and efficiency, therefore making the technology viable both today and in
the future. Additionally, nuclear power has the most stable operating
budget because its costs are more predictable; for example, uranium
supply is plentiful and inexpensive, while oil and natural gas prices
are volatile and increasingly expensive. n80 This stability makes
nuclear power less vulnerable to price spikes that could damage the
industry\'s viability and strain businesses. Perhaps most importantly,
nuclear power is both a short and long-term solution. In the short-term,
it can currently provide for the country\'s growing energy demand, with
cost-efficient technology already in place. Nuclear technology currently
exists to provide powerful and efficient energy; the fact that nuclear
power is already developed to this efficiency gives it a unique
advantage over other alternative energies, which are still in their
infancy and thus unable to provide a large amount of power in a
cost-effective manner at this time. In the long-term, nuclear power is a
critical part of a cost-effective and sustainable energy economy.
Nuclear power\'s many advantages and opportunities make it an essential
energy alternative capable of providing for the country\'s changing
needs in an environmentally-safe manner[. [It can prevent]{.mark} the
pending economic collapse caused by oil and natural gas shortages, avoid
the pollution and [global warming dangers]{.mark} of fossil fuel
emissions, and fill the energy gap quickly and efficiently]{.underline},
before fossil fuel\'s dangers become irreversible. n81 \[\*330\]

### Nuclear Good\-\--Resource Wars

#### Energy insecurity causes nuclear war

**Cabral**, Landmark College IR professor, **2010** (Jim, "Book Review
-- Rising Powers, Shrinking Planet", July,
http://www.zcommunications.org/rising-powers-shrinking-planet-by-jim-cabral)

Not surprisingly, the [[accelerating militarization of energy
procurement increases the possibilities for]{.mark} **armed
[international conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline}. With typical insight,
Klare explains how [[**nationalism** provides
momentum]{.underline}]{.mark} to this process: \"The long-term [[**risk
of escalation** is growing]{.underline}]{.mark} even more potent
[[because]{.mark} major energy [importers]{.mark}]{.underline} and
exporters regularly [[appeal to]{.underline}]{.mark} that most
[[dangerous]{.mark} of emotions, [nationalism]{.mark}, [in
making]{.mark}]{.underline} their [[claim]{.mark}
[over]{.mark}]{.underline} the management of [[energy flows.]{.mark}
[Nationalistic appeals]{.mark}]{.underline}, once they have gripped a
populace, almost invariably [[promote **fierce emotion and
irrational**]{.mark}**ity**]{.underline}. Add to this the fact that the
[leaders of most countries involved in the]{.underline} great [energy
race]{.underline} have come to [view the struggle over hydrocarbon
assets as a \"zero-sum\" contest]{.underline}---one in
[which]{.underline} a gain for one country almost always represents a
loss for others. [[A zero-sum mentality leads to a **loss of flexibility
in crisis situations**]{.underline}]{.mark}, while the lens of
nationalism turns the pursuit of energy assets into a sacred obligation
of senior government officials.\" The \"competitive arms transfers\"
that represent the militarization of energy procurement also have
another disturbing upshot: strengthening and legitimizing repressive,
corrupt regimes. In the case of U.S. arms recipients, the list is long
and growing. It includes long-time allies in the Persian Gulf
region---Saudi Arabia most notably---whose anachronistic social policies
effectively reduce women to the status of second class citizens;
corruptible African governments in Nigeria, Chad, and Angola, where---
along with off-shore drilling sites along the continent\'s west coast
---U.S.-based oil companies such as Exxon and Chevron currently operate;
and more recent allies in the energy rich Caspian Sea region, including
what Klare refers to as the \"autocratic regimes\" of Kazakhstan,
Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan. While the governments of the oil rich
Persian Gulf have long been wooed with deficit countries\' military
largess, the emergence of the Caspian Sea region\'s governments as
coveted allies may come as a bit of a surprise to some. Klare soberly
sketches out a \"three-way struggle for geopolitical advantage\" in the
Caspian Sea basin, as [the U.S., Russia]{.underline} (Caspian states
having formerly been Soviet republics), [and China funnel
arms]{.underline} and other forms of military assistance [into the
region]{.underline} in competition for influence there. Again [stressing
the dangers of an escalation of conflict,]{.underline} Klare notes that:
\"[This three-way struggle...is **militarizing the Caspian basin**,
inundating the region with **advanced arms**]{.underline} and an ever
growing corps of military advisers, instructors, technicians, and
combat-support personnel. [\[It will\] heighten traditional suspicions
and rivalries that have long plagued the region. [The Great Powers
are]{.mark}]{.underline} not only adding tinder to possible future
fires, but also [[increasing the risk that they will be **caught in any
conflagration**]{.underline}]{.mark}.\"

#### Independently scale up of nuclear energy solves conflict

Michael **Shellenberger**, 8-29-**2018**, President of Environmental
Progress, \"For Nations Seeking Nuclear Energy, The Option To Build A
Weapon Remains A Feature Not A Bug\", Forbes,
https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelshellenberger/2018/08/29/for-nations-seeking-nuclear-energy-the-option-to-build-a-weapon-remains-a-feature-not-a-bug/#55aaf61b2747

In 2015[, two scholars]{.underline} at Texas A&M university, Matthew
[Fuhrmann and Benjamin Tkach, set]{.underline} [out to answer two
questions: how many nations have the ability to build a weapon? And what
impact does nuclear weapons "latency" have on war? A [growing]{.mark}
body of [research]{.mark} had [found]{.mark} that [latency **deters
against military attacks**]{.mark}]{.underline}, Fuhrmann and Tkach
noted. But with Israel and U.S. threatening pre-emptive action against
Iran, could latency also be a threat to peace? Fuhrmann and Tkach found
that 31 nations had the capacity to enrich uranium or reprocess
plutonium, and that 71 percent of them created that capacity to give
themselves weapons latency. [What was [the]{.mark} [relationship]{.mark}
between nuclear latency and military conflict? It [was
negative]{.mark}]{.underline}. "[Nuclear [latency]{.mark} appears to
[provide]{.mark} [s]{.mark}tates with [deterrence]{.mark}-related
[benefits]{.mark}," they concluded, "that are [distinct from]{.mark}
actively [pursuing nuclear bombs]{.mark}." Why]{.underline} might this
be? [Arriving at an ultimate cause is difficult if not impossible, the
authors note]{.underline}. [But one obvious possibility is that the
"[latent]{.mark} nuclear [powers may be able to deter]{.mark} conflict
[by (implicitly) threatening to 'go nuclear' following an]{.mark}
[attack]{.mark}." Nuclear isn't the first energy technology whose
adoption was driven by national security]{.underline}. [Before World War
I, the British Navy switched to petroleum-powered ships that could
travel twice as far, emit less smoke (]{.underline}that potential
enemies could see), [and refuel more quickly]{.underline} than
coal-powered ones. [And today's efficient natural gas turbines exist in
large part thanks to decades of military procurement of jet turbines.
Every past energy transition has followed the same progression. The new
fuel]{.underline}, whether coal, oil, natural gas, or uranium, [starts
out as a premium product more expensive than the incumbent and comes
down in price over time. For early adopters]{.underline} of the new
fuel-technology combination, notes economist Roger Fouquet, [a new
energy source must offer some "superior or additional characteristics
(e.g. easier, cleaner or more flexible to use)." After over 60 years of
national security driving nuclear power into the international system,
**we can now add "preventing war" to the list of nuclear energy's
superior characteristics.**]{.underline} "Your view that weapons drove
nations to energy, not the other way around," M.I.T.'s Narang told me,
"may be more accurate given what we now know about many of these
countries." [[He pointed to Sweden and Switzerland: Both are neutral
nations outside of NATO that had a very deep interest in weapons]{.mark}
and a program through the 1960s. Today [they are championed as
nonproliferation nations, but both]{.mark} militaries [were]{.mark} very
[interested in]{.mark} having [the basis for]{.mark} a [nuclear]{.mark}
[weapons]{.mark} program [if necessary. Both used nuclear energy]{.mark}
to explore those options.]{.underline} Before Iran, Narang notes, [[the
nation most famous]{.mark} for nuclear weapons hedging [was
Japan]{.mark}. After six decades of peaceful nuclear power, it's an open
secret that Japan has created enough plutonium to create 6,000 bombs ---
as well as an excellent rocket program. That doesn't mean nuclear power
is a **sure thing in nations with nuclear weapons**.]{.underline} France
officially pledged under its last government to sharply reduce its
reliance on nuclear power. But then President Emmanuel Macron explicitly
said late last year that he would not carry out the policy. Japan, which
lacks a weapon, closed all of its nuclear reactors after the 2011
Fukushima panic and intends to restart just two-thirds of them. At the
same time, it has shown no interest in giving up its weapons latency,
with its plutonium program continuing.

### XT\-\--Warming

#### It's the only way to solve warming

Richard **Rhodes**, 7-19-**2018**, been a visiting scholar at Harvard,
MIT, and Stanford University, \"Why Nuclear Power Must Be Part of the
Energy Solution\", Yale E360,
https://e360.yale.edu/features/why-nuclear-power-must-be-part-of-the-energy-solution-environmentalists-climate

[In the late 16th century, when the increasing cost of firewood
forced]{.underline} ordinary [Londoners to switch reluctantly to coal,
Elizabethan preachers railed against a fuel they believed to be,
**literally, the Devil's excrement**. Coal was black, after all, dirty,
found in layers underground]{.underline} --- down toward Hell at the
center of the earth --- and smelled strongly of sulfur when it burned.
Switching to coal, in houses that usually lacked chimneys, was difficult
enough; the clergy's outspoken condemnation, while certainly justified
environmentally, further complicated and delayed the timely resolution
of an urgent problem in energy supply. [For too many environmentalists
concerned with global warming]{.underline}, **[nuclear energy is today's
Devil's excrement]{.underline}**. [They condemn it for its
production]{.underline} [and use of radioactive fuels and for the
supposed problem of disposing of its]{.underline} [waste]{.underline}.
In my judgment, their [condemnation of this efficient, low-carbon source
of baseload energy is **misplaced**]{.underline}. Far from being the
Devil's excrement, [[nuclear power]{.mark} can be, and [should be, **one
major component of our rescue from a hotter,**]{.mark} **more
[meteorologically destructive]{.mark} [world]{.mark}.**]{.underline}
Like all energy sources, nuclear power has advantages and disadvantages.
What are nuclear power's benefits? First and foremost, [[since it
produces energy via]{.mark} nuclear [fission]{.mark} rather than
chemical burning, [it generates baseload electricity **with no**]{.mark}
**output of [carbon]{.mark}**, the villainous element of global warming.
[Switching from coal to natural gas is a **step toward
decarbonizing**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [since]{.underline} [burning
natural gas produces **about half the carbon dioxide of burning
coal**]{.underline}. [[But]{.underline} [switching from coal to nuclear
power is **radically**]{.underline}]{.mark}
[**[decarbonizing]{.underline}**, [since nuclear
power]{.underline}]{.mark} [plants [release]{.mark} greenhouse
[gases]{.mark}]{.underline} [[only from the ancillary use]{.mark} of
fossil fuels during their construction, mining, fuel processing,
maintenance, and decommissioning --- **[about as much as solar
power]{.mark} [does]{.mark}**, which is about 4 to 5 percent as much as
a natural gas-fired power plant.]{.underline} Nuclear power releases
less radiation into the environment than any other major energy source.
[Second, [nuclear power]{.mark} plants [operate at]{.mark} much [higher
capacity]{.mark} factors [than renewable energy sources or]{.mark}
[fossil fuels]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [Capacity factor is a measure of
what percentage of the time a]{.underline}]{.mark} [power [plant]{.mark}
actually [produces energy. It's a problem for all intermittent]{.mark}
energy [sources]{.mark}. The sun doesn't always shine, nor the wind
always blow, nor water always fall through the turbines of a dam. In the
United States in 2016, [nuclear power]{.mark} plants, which generated
almost 20 percent of U.S. electricity, had [an average capacity]{.mark}
factor [of 92.3 percent, meaning they **operated at full**]{.mark}
**[power on 336]{.mark} out of 365 [days]{.mark} per
year**]{.underline}. (The other 29 days they were taken off the grid for
maintenance.) In contrast, [U.S. [hydroelectric systems
delivered]{.mark} power [38]{.mark}.2 [percent]{.mark} of the
time]{.underline} (138 days per year), [[wind]{.underline}]{.mark}
turbines [[34]{.mark}.5 percent]{.underline} of the time (127 days per
year) [[and]{.underline} [solar]{.underline}]{.mark} electricity arrays
[[only 25]{.mark}.1 percent]{.underline} of the time (92 days per year).
[Even plants powered with coal or natural gas only generate electricity
about half the time f]{.underline}or reasons such as fuel costs and
seasonal and nocturnal variations in demand. **[[Nuclear is a clear
winner on reliability.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Third[, nuclear power
releases less radiation into the environment than any other major energy
source.]{.underline} This statement will seem paradoxical to many
readers, since it's not commonly known that non-nuclear energy sources
release any radiation into the environment. They do. The worst offender
is coal, a mineral of the earth's crust that contains a substantial
volume of the radioactive elements uranium and thorium. [Burning coal
gasifies its organic materials, concentrating its mineral components
into the remaining waste, called fly ash. So much coal is burned in the
world and so much fly ash produced that coal is actually the major
source of radioactive releases into the environment.]{.underline} In the
early 1950s, when the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission believed high-grade
uranium ores to be in short supply domestically, it considered
extracting uranium for nuclear weapons from the abundant U.S. supply of
fly ash from coal burning. In 2007, China began exploring such
extraction, drawing on a pile of some 5.3 million metric tons of
brown-coal fly ash at Xiaolongtang in Yunnan. The Chinese ash averages
about 0.4 pounds of triuranium octoxide (U3O8), a uranium compound, per
metric ton. Hungary and South Africa are also exploring uranium
extraction from coal fly ash. What are nuclear's downsides? In the
public's perception, there are two, both related to radiation: the risk
of accidents, and the question of disposal of nuclear waste. There have
been three large-scale accidents involving nuclear power reactors since
the onset of commercial nuclear power in the mid-1950s: Three-Mile
Island in Pennsylvania, Chernobyl in Ukraine, and Fukushima in Japan.
The partial meltdown of the Three-Mile Island reactor in March 1979,
while a disaster for the owners of the Pennsylvania plant, released only
a minimal quantity of radiation to the surrounding population. According
to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission: "The approximately 2 million
people around TMI-2 during the accident are estimated to have received
an average radiation dose of only about 1 millirem above the usual
background dose. To put this into context, exposure from a chest X-ray
is about 6 millirem and the area's natural radioactive background dose
is about 100-125 millirem per year... In spite of serious damage to the
reactor, the actual release had negligible effects on the physical
health of individuals or the environment." The explosion and subsequent
burnout of a large graphite-moderated, water-cooled reactor at Chernobyl
in 1986 was easily the worst nuclear accident in history. Twenty-nine
disaster relief workers died of acute radiation exposure in the
immediate aftermath of the accident. In the subsequent three decades,
UNSCEAR --- the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of
Atomic Radiation, composed of senior scientists from 27 member states
--- has observed and reported at regular intervals on the health effects
of the Chernobyl accident. It has identified no long-term health
consequences to populations exposed to Chernobyl fallout except for
thyroid cancers in residents of Belarus, Ukraine and western Russia who
were children or adolescents at the time of the accident, who drank milk
contaminated with 131iodine, and who were not evacuated. By 2008,
UNSCEAR had attributed some 6,500 excess cases of thyroid cancer in the
Chernobyl region to the accident, with 15 deaths. The occurrence of
these cancers increased dramatically from 1991 to 1995, which
researchers attributed mostly to radiation exposure. No increase
occurred in adults. "The average effective doses" of radiation from
Chernobyl, UNSCEAR also concluded, "due to both external and internal
exposures, received by members of the general public during 1986-2005
\[were\] about 30 mSv for the evacuees, 1 mSv for the residents of the
former Soviet Union, and 0.3 mSv for the populations of the rest of
Europe." A sievert is a measure of radiation exposure, a millisievert is
one-one-thousandth of a sievert. A full-body CT scan delivers about
10-30 mSv. A U.S. resident receives an average background radiation
dose, exclusive of radon, of about 1 mSv per year. The statistics of
Chernobyl irradiations cited here are so low that they must seem
intentionally minimized to those who followed the extensive media
coverage of the accident and its aftermath. Yet they are the
peer-reviewed products of extensive investigation by an international
scientific agency of the United Nations. They indicate that even the
worst possible accident at a nuclear power plant --- the complete
meltdown and burnup of its radioactive fuel --- was yet far less
destructive than other major industrial accidents across the past
century. To name only two: Bhopal, in India, where at least 3,800 people
died immediately and many thousands more were sickened when 40 tons of
methyl isocyanate gas leaked from a pesticide plant; and Henan Province,
in China, where at least 26,000 people drowned following the failure of
a major hydroelectric dam in a typhoon. "Measured as early deaths per
electricity units produced by the Chernobyl facility (9 years of
operation, total electricity production of 36 GWe-years, 31 early
deaths) yields 0.86 death/GWe-year)," concludes Zbigniew Jaworowski, a
physician and former UNSCEAR chairman active during the Chernobyl
accident. "This rate is lower than the average fatalities from
\[accidents involving\] a majority of other energy sources. For example,
the Chernobyl rate is nine times lower than the death rate from
liquefied gas... and 47 times lower than from hydroelectric stations."
The accident in Japan at Fukushima Daiichi in March 2011 followed a
major earthquake and tsunami. The tsunami flooded out the power supply
and cooling systems of three power reactors, causing them to melt down
and explode, breaching their confinement. Although 154,000 Japanese
citizens were evacuated from a 12-mile exclusion zone around the power
station, radiation exposure beyond the station grounds was limited.
According to the report submitted to the International Atomic Energy
Agency in June 2011: "No harmful health effects were found in 195,345
residents living in the vicinity of the plant who were screened by the
end of May 2011. All the 1,080 children tested for thyroid gland
exposure showed results within safe limits. By December, government
health checks of some 1,700 residents who were evacuated from three
municipalities showed that two-thirds received an external radiation
dose within the normal international limit of 1 mSv/year, 98 percent
were below 5 mSv/year, and 10 people were exposed to more than 10 mSv...
\[There\] was no major public exposure, let alone deaths from
radiation." Nuclear waste disposal, although a continuing political
problem in the U.S., is not any longer a technological problem. Most
U.S. spent fuel, more than 90 percent of which could be recycled to
extend nuclear power production by hundreds of years, is stored at
present safely in impenetrable concrete-and-steel dry casks on the
grounds of operating reactors, its radiation slowly declining. The U.S.
Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) near Carlsbad, New Mexico currently
stores low-level and transuranic military waste and could store
commercial nuclear waste in a 2-kilometer thick bed of crystalline salt,
the remains of an ancient sea. The salt formation extends from southern
New Mexico all the way northeast to southwestern Kansas. It could easily
accommodate the entire world's nuclear waste for the next thousand
years. Finland is even further advanced in carving out a permanent
repository in granite bedrock 400 meters under Olkiluoto, an island in
the Baltic Sea off the nation's west coast. It expects to begin
permanent waste storage in 2023. A final complaint against nuclear power
is that it costs too much. Whether or not nuclear power costs too much
will ultimately be a matter for markets to decide, but there is no
question that a full accounting of the external costs of different
energy systems would find nuclear cheaper than coal or natural gas.
[[Nuclear]{.mark} power is]{.underline} [not the only answer to the
world-scale threat of global warming]{.underline}. Renewables have their
place; so, at least for leveling the flow of electricity when renewables
vary, does natural gas. [But nuclear deserves better]{.underline} than
the anti-nuclear prejudices and fears that have plagued it. It isn't the
21st century's version of the Devil's excrement. [It['s]{.mark}
a]{.underline} [[valuable,]{.mark} even an **[irreplaceable, part of the
solution to the greatest energy threat in the]{.mark} [history of
humankind]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

#### Newest studies prove nuclear energy is critical to stave off the worst effects of warming

Jonathan **Tirone**, 9-3-**2018** Reporter citing a study by MIT
"Nuclear Has to Use Climate Crisis to Justify High Cost, MIT Says"
https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-03/nuclear-has-to-use-climate-crisis-to-justify-high-cost-mit-says

**[[To stave off runaway]{.mark} global [warming]{.mark}]{.underline}**
by mid-century, [the world's current crop of [leaders need to institute
policies that]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[dial down greenhouse
gases]{.underline}** [emitted by power producers]{.underline}]{.mark}
more than 90 percent, [according to scientists at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology]{.underline}. The clearest way to get there may
be by putting a price on carbon emissions and supporting clean
technologies. "As of today and for decades to come, [[the main value of
nuclear energy lies in]{.mark} its potential contribution to
**[de-carbonizing the power sector]{.mark}**]{.underline}," [reads the
246-page report published]{.underline} [Monday.]{.underline} "Cost is
the main barrier to realizing this value. Without cost reductions,
nuclear energy will not play a significant role." The study casts doubt
on whether President Donald Trump's attempts to rescue money-losing U.S.
reactors while undoing climate policies can succeed. A more
straightforward path to supporting the nuclear industry would be to
follow the lead of other countries that have put a price on emissions,
either through direct taxation or carbon-trading markets. That would
give atomic operators more room to compete against cheap gas, wind and
solar. [[In order to **stabilize climate change**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} **[keep temperature rises well below 2
degrees]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[Celsius]{.underline}** (3.6 degrees
Fahrenheit) by 2050, **[[utilities need to cut carbon]{.mark} [dioxide
emissions]{.mark}]{.underline}** [to an average of about 10 grams from
500 grams a]{.underline} [kilowatt-hour]{.underline}, according to the
study. [[Failure to deploy nuclear could mean missing enormous]{.mark}
costs [savings]{.mark}, [especially in]{.mark} emerging [markets like
China, **that**]{.mark} **still [rely heavily on burning coal for
electricity.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

#### Nuclear energy is the [only technology]{.underline} to resolve global warming

**Brook et al 14** (Barry W., Barry W. ecologist and modeler, Professor
of Environmental Sustainability, University of Tasmania, "Why nuclear
energy is sustainable and has to be part of the energy mix",
http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214993714000050)

[[Humanity]{.mark} must face the reality that it [cannot
depend]{.mark}]{.underline} indefinitely [[on]{.mark} combustion of
[coal, gas and oil]{.mark} for most of its energy needs]{.underline}.
[In the unavoidable process of gradually replacing fossil fuels, many
energy technologies may be considered]{.underline} and most will be
deployed in specific applications. However, in the long term, we argue
that **[[nuclear]{.mark} fission [tech]{.mark}nology [is the
only]{.mark} developed [energy]{.mark} source that is [capable of
delivering]{.mark} the enormous [quantities of energy that will be
needed to run modern]{.mark} industrial [societies]{.mark} safely,
economically, reliably and in a sustainable way]{.underline}**, both
environmentally and as regards the available resource base.
Consequently, [nuclear fission has to play a major role in this
necessary transformation of the 21st century energy-supply
system]{.underline}. In a first phase of this necessary global energy
transformation, [the emphasis should be on converting the major part of
the world\'s electrical energy generation capacity from fossil fuels to
nuclear fission]{.underline}. [This can realistically be achieved within
a few decades]{.underline}, as has already been done in France during
the 1970s and 1980s. **[[Such an energy transformation would reduce the
global emissions of carbon dioxide]{.mark} [profoundly]{.mark}, as well
as [cutting]{.mark} other significant greenhouse gases]{.underline}**
like **[[methane]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[Industrial nations should
take the lead in this transition.]{.underline}** Because methane is a
potent greenhouse gas, replacing coal-fired generating stations with
gas-fired stations will not necessarily result in a reduction of the
rate of greenhouse-gas emission even for relatively low leakage rates of
the natural gas into the atmosphere. [The energy sources popularly known
as '[renewables']{.mark}]{.underline} (such as wind and solar), [[will
be hard pressed to supply]{.mark} the needed quantities of energy
[sustainably]{.mark}, [economically and reliably]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[They are]{.underline}]{.mark} inherently [[intermittent]{.mark},
[depending on backup power]{.mark}]{.underline} or on energy storage [if
they are to be used for]{.underline} delivery of base-load electrical
energy to [the grid]{.underline}. [This backup power has to be flexible
and is derived in most cases from combustion of fossil
fuels]{.underline} (mainly natural gas). If used in this way,
**[intermittent energy sources do not meet the requirements of
sustainability, nor are they economically viable]{.underline}** because
they require redundant, under-utilized investment in capacity both for
generation and for transmission. [Intermittent energy installations, in
conjunction with gas-fired backup power installations, will in many
cases be found to have a combined rate of greenhouse-gas emission that
is higher than that of stand-alone coal-fired generating
stations]{.underline} of equal generating capacity. [A grid connection
fee]{.underline}, to be imposed on countries with a large intermittent
generating capacity, [should be considered for the purpose of
compensating adjacent countries]{.underline} for the use of their
interconnected electric grids as back-up power. Also, [intermittent
energy sources tend to negatively affect grid stability, especially as
their market penetration rises]{.underline}. The alternative ---
dedicated energy storage for grid-connected intermittent energy sources
(instead of backup power) --- is in many cases not yet economically
viable. However, [intermittent sources plus storage may be economically
competitive for local electricity supply]{.underline} in geographically
isolated regions without access to a large electric grid. **[Yet
[nuclear fission]{.mark} energy [will]{.mark}, even then, [be required
for]{.mark} the majority [displacement of fossil fuels]{.mark} this
century.]{.underline}**

#### Nuclear powered desalination plants solve global scarcity

Scientists think that [nuclear-powered desalination plants could help
bring potable water to drought stricken communities]{.underline},
accordint to a [report by the
BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-61483491).

According to the United Nations, [[communities on every
continent](https://www.unwater.org/water-facts/scarcity/) are currently
experiencing water scarcity]{.underline}. Northern Mexico is currently
experiencing [historic water
shortages](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/dams-taps-running-dry-northern-mexico-amid-historic-water-shortages-2022-06-20/).
Low water levels in Iraq are [straining

East Scotland is currently on a [high water scarcity

And right now, India is experiencing a [deadly water crisis that affects
the country every
summer](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-61679615).

In the United States, 32 percent of contiguous states were affected by
"severe to extreme" drought, as [reported by the National Drought
Report](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/monthly-report/drought/202205).
Earlier this month, BBC called the events in the western US, ["a
once-in-a-lifetime
drought."](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-61669233)
[Climate-intensified water scarcity is one of the most prevalent
problems across the globe, and nuclear power desalination plants might
pose a solution.]{.underline}

Desalination plants help supply fresh water by removing salt from
seawater. When only 2.5% of the planet's abundance of ocean and sea
water is drinkable fresh water, the [demand for desalination is high.
The demand for fresh water is expected to exceed the existing
sustainable water supply by 40% by 2030]{.underline} [as
reported](https://www.google.com/search?q=drinking+water+expected+to+exceed+supply&oq=drinking+water+expected+to+exceed+supply&aqs=chrome..69i57j33i160l3j33i22i29i30.7877j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)
by the U.S. Intelligence Community Assessment of Global Water Security.
This is projected to be the [result of a trifecta: population growth,
scaling industrialization, and climate change.]{.underline}

However, [desalination plants are one of the most expensive ways of
creating safe drinking water and are an extremely energy-intensive
process.]{.underline} However, [powered by nuclear reactors, floating
vessels equipped with desalination plants could travel to islands and
coastlines affected by drought, bringing them not only safe drinking
water but power.]{.underline}

#### Nuclear is the best climate option and doesn't cause water scarcity

**ONE 19** \[ONE, Office of Nuclear Energy, 10-16-2019, accessed on
7-23-2022, Office of Nuclear Energy, \"5 Problems You Didn't Know
Nuclear Could Solve\",
https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/5-problems-you-didnt-know-nuclear-could-solve
mimou\]

1\. Electricity emissions

[**Nuclear produces clean power 24 hours a day, 7 days a week**. In
2021, it generated a record 778 billion kilowatt hours of electricity
and provided [50% of America's carbon-free
power](https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/5-fast-facts-about-nuclear-energy)]{.underline}.
That's because [nuclear reactors produce massive amounts of energy
through [fission --- a physical
process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2W-GEE6YU4M)]{.underline} that
splits uranium atoms to generate heat.  [Fission doesn't emit greenhouse
gases and allows nuclear to avoid more than 471 million metric tons of
carbon each year]{.underline} in the United States.

2\. [Industrial sector emissions]{.underline}

Nuclear power plants aren't just an excellent source of carbon-free
electricity, but they're also a [great source of thermal
energy.]{.underline}  According to the [Environmental Protection
Agency](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions),
the [industrial sector accounted for 24% of U.S. greenhouse gas
emissions in 2020]{.underline}. Many of its crucial processes require
high-quality steam which is [currently produced using fossil
fuels]{.underline}. Directing [heat from nuclear reactors toward
industrial processes such as oil refining, district heating and
fertilizers could help **rapidly decarbonize** these and other
energy-intensive manufacturing processes.]{.underline}

3\. [Transportation sector emissions]{.underline}

[Nearly 30% of greenhouse gas emissions comes from the transportation
sector]{.underline}, making it the largest contributor of U.S. carbon
pollution. But what if we could harness the high-temperature heat from
current reactors and, in the future, advanced reactors? [Nuclear's
thermal heat could be used to
produce [hydrogen](https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/could-hydrogen-help-save-nuclear)]{.underline},
an energy carrier that is primarily created through steam methane
reforming from natural gas. This process converts high-temperature steam
and methane into hydrogen gas, but it also produces carbon dioxide.
[**Nuclear can completely decarbonize the process** using heat from
reactors and electrolysis, the splitting of water into hydrogen and
oxygen using electricity]{.underline}. This approach [cuts carbon
emissions and opens the door to other environmentally friendly
advancements in **electric vehicles, biofuel upgrades, and synthetic
fuel production**]{.underline}.

4\. [Water scarcity]{.underline}

Almost a third of the world doesn't have access to clean drinking water
with [more than 2 billion people living in countries affected by water
scarcity]{.underline}. These numbers are only expected to rise. Current
desalination plants around the world produce 10 trillion gallons of
drinking water each year. More are coming on-line to meet future water
needs, which is expected to grow by up to 30% in the next three decades.
[Existing desalination plants are energy intensive and rely heavily on
fossil fuels]{.underline}. An increase in plants [will lead to an
increase in emissions]{.underline}. [Nuclear energy could play a major
role in providing low emission energy that would **get us closer to
obtaining worldwide water security**]{.underline}. A new fleet of
reactors could expedite this process. [[Small modular reactors
(SMRs)](https://www.energy.gov/ne/nuclear-reactor-technologies/small-modular-nuclear-reactors) will
offer greater flexibility in size and operation to generate both
electrical energy and thermal energy right at the seawater desalination
plant]{.underline}.

[US: Future of nuclear power uncertain]{.underline}

The [US currently has [94 nuclear
reactors](https://www.worldnuclearreport.org/+-United-States-+.html)]{.underline} --- more
than any other country in the world. In 2019, they met 20% of the
country\'s electricity demand. The US also has the oldest reactors in
the world, with an average age of 40 years.

Most reactors went into operation by 1985; [only one started up within
the last 20 years.]{.underline} Construction of two new reactors began
in 2013. These are expected to begin working in the next few years.

The **[future of nuclear power in the US is uncertain]{.underline}**.
Although there are concepts for a new generation of reactors, it is
questionable whether they can one day generate electricity as cheaply as
the renewable energy sector.

There is [no final
repository](https://www.boell.de/en/2019/11/11/world-nuclear-waste-report) for
highly radioactive waste in the US. It is stored on-site at the power
plants.

Russia wants to export nuclear power

Russia currently operates 38 nuclear reactors. In 2019, they covered
about 20% of electricity demand. Ten new reactors have come online over
the past decade. Two nuclear power plants have been under
construction and are expected to start up in the next few years. The
average age of Russian reactors is 28 years.

[As [Russia no longer wants to subsidize the
construction](https://world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/Rosatom-postpones-fast-reactor-project-report-say) of
nuclear power plants in its own country, new domestic construction
projects are uncertain]{.underline}. Instead, the state corporation
Rosatom wants to focus on building reactors abroad in the future.
According to WNISR, 10 Russian reactors are currently under construction
abroad, two each in Bangladesh, India, Turkey and Slovakia, and one each
in Iran and Belarus.

[Russia does not have a final storage facility for its highly
radioactive nuclear waste]{.underline}. Critics have complained about
the lack of transparency in the handling of nuclear waste.

[Nuclear power too expensive in India]{.underline}

India currently has 21 nuclear reactors. In 2019, the share of nuclear
power in the grid was 3%. Three reactors went online over the last 10
years, and six power plants are under construction. The average age of
reactors is 23 years.

However, [the expansion of nuclear power in India has been plagued by
delays and mounting costs.]{.underline}

In 2012, the Planning Commission of India projected that the total
capacity of all reactors would increase from just under 5 gigawatts (GW)
to as much as 30 GW by 2027.

Today, reactors with a capacity of less than 7 GW are connected to the
grid. The reactors under construction have a total capacity of 4 GW.
[Since the construction time of reactors in India is more than 10 years,
a maximum of 11 GW will be on the grid in 2027, almost three times less
than originally planned.]{.underline}

[India does not have a final storage facility for highly radioactive
nuclear waste.]{.underline}

[China: More renewables instead of nuclear power]{.underline}

China is the world leader in the construction of new nuclear power
plants. In the last 10 years, 37 reactors have come online. According to
WNISR, 49 reactors were generating electricity at the beginning of 2021
and 17 more reactors are under construction. The share of nuclear power
in the country\'s electricity mix was 5% in 2019.

But [China also built significantly fewer reactors than originally
planned in the country\'s five-year plan]{.underline}. At the same time,
the **[expansion of renewable energies is eclipsing
nuclear.]{.underline}**

According to the National Energy Administration, 72 GW of wind power, 48
GW of photovoltaics and 13 GW of hydropower were connected to the grid
in 2020. Nuclear power plants contributed only 2 GW of new capacity in
the same year.

[China does not have a repository for highly radioactive
waste]{.underline}, but it is [exploring one in the Gobi
Desert.](https://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-a-f/china-nuclear-fuel-cycle.aspx) Its
nuclear waste is currently stored at various reactor sites.

[France: Nuclear industry with huge losses]{.underline}

France has relied on nuclear power like no other country in the world in
recent decades. In 2019, almost 71% of electricity demand was covered by
nuclear power. Currently, 56 power plants are still in operation and one
is under construction. The power plants have an average age of 36 years,
and the last reactor went online in 1999.

The [**world\'s largest nuclear energy supplier** and [state-owned group
EDF](https://www.edf.fr/en/the-edf-group/dedicated-sections/journalists/all-press-releases/2020-half-year-results),
which operates the French reactors, is **indebted to the tune of €42
billion (\$50.3 billion)** and will have to invest an estimated [€100
billion by
2030](https://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/dyn/15/rapports/cenucl/l15b1122-tii_rapport-enquete) to
keep the old reactors in operation.]{.underline}

It is still [unclear whether new reactors for nuclear power will be
built in France]{.underline}. The decision has been postponed and is to
be taken by the new French government after the next election in 2022.

There is [[no final
repository](https://www.dw.com/en/germany-launches-new-search-for-permanent-nuclear-waste-disposal-site/a-55077967) for
highly radioactive waste in France.]{.underline}

[Poland: No investor for nuclear power]{.underline}

[Poland has been planning to go nuclear since 1980 and started building
two reactors, but stopped construction after the Chernobyl reactor
disaster of 1986]{.underline}.

After that, there were repeated and ultimately unsuccessful attempts to
restart construction. In 2014, the government adopted a plan to build
six new reactors, with the first unit coming online in 2024. However,
[little has happened since then because it remains unclear how this
costly program is to be financed.]{.underline}

#### Renewable shift is here now but rising costs and ineffective policy prevent adoption -- best-case scenario still can't solve warming

**IEA 21** \[IEA, International Energy Agency, 12-1-2021, accessed on

than ever worldwide, supporting the emergence of the new global energy

The [growth of the world's capacity to generate electricity from solar
panels, wind turbines and other **renewable technologies is on course to
accelerate** over the coming years]{.underline}, with [2021 expected to
set a fresh all-time record for new installations, the IEA says in a new
report.]{.underline}

Despite rising costs for key materials used to make solar panels and
wind turbines, [additions of new renewable power capacity this year are
forecast to rise to 290 gigawatts]{.underline} (GW) in 2021, surpassing
the previous all-time high set last year, according to the latest
edition of the IEA's annual Renewables Market Report.

[By 2026, global renewable electricity capacity is forecast **to rise
more than 60% from 2020 levels to over 4 800 GW** -- equivalent to the
current total global power capacity of fossil fuels and nuclear
combined.]{.underline} Renewables are [set to account for almost **95%
of the increase in global power capacity through 2026**]{.underline},
with solar PV alone providing more than half. The [amount of renewable
capacity added over the period of 2021 to 2026 is expected to be 50%
higher than from 2015 to 2020.]{.underline} This is [driven by stronger
support from government policies and more ambitious clean energy goals
announced before and during the COP26 Climate Change
Conference.]{.underline}

"This year's [record renewable electricity additions of 290 gigawatts
are yet another sign that a **new global energy economy is
emerging**]{.underline}," said IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol. "The
high commodity and energy prices we are seeing today pose new challenges
for the renewable industry, but [elevated fossil fuel prices also make
renewables even more competitive]{.underline}."

The [growth of renewables is forecast to increase in all regions
compared with the 2015-2020 period]{.underline}. [China remains the
global leader in the volume of capacity additions: it is expected to
reach 1200 GW of total wind and solar capacity in 2026]{.underline} --
four years earlier than its current target of 2030. [India is set to
come top in terms of the rate of growth, doubling new installations
compared with 2015-2020]{.underline}. Deployments in [Europe and the
United States are also on track to speed up significantly from the
previous five years]{.underline}. These four [markets together account
for **80% of renewable capacity expansion** **worldwide**.]{.underline}

"The [growth of renewables in India is outstanding]{.underline},
supporting the government's [newly announced goal of reaching 500 GW of
renewable power capacity by 2030]{.underline} and highlighting India's
broader potential to **[accelerate its clean energy
transition]{.underline}**," said Dr Birol. "[China continues to
demonstrate its clean energy strengths]{.underline}, with the expansion
of renewables suggesting the country could well [achieve a peak in its
CO2 emissions well before 2030."]{.underline}

[Solar PV]{.underline} remains the powerhouse of growth in renewable
electricity, with its capacity additions [forecast to increase by 17% in
2021]{.underline} to a new record of almost 160 GW. In the same time
frame, onshore wind additions are set to be almost one-quarter higher on
average than during the 2015-20 period. [Total offshore wind capacity is
forecast to more than triple by 2026.]{.underline}

The IEA report expects this record growth for renewables to take place
despite today's high commodity and transport prices. However, [should
commodity prices remain high through the end of next year, the cost of
wind investments would go back up to levels last seen in
2015]{.underline} and three years of cost reductions for solar PV would
be erased.

[Despite rising prices limiting growth, global biofuel demand in 2021 is
forecast to surpass 2019 levels, rebounding from last year's huge
decline caused by the pandemic]{.underline}. Demand for **[biofuels is
set to grow strongly to 2026]{.underline}**, with Asia accounting for
almost 30% of new production. [India is expected to rise to become the
third largest market for ethanol worldwide]{.underline}, behind the
United States and Brazil.

Governments can further accelerate the growth of renewables by
addressing key barriers, such as [permitting and grid integration
challenges, social acceptance issues, inconsistent policy approaches,
and insufficient remuneration. **High financing costs** in the
developing world are also a major obstacle]{.underline}. In the report's
accelerated case, which assumes some of these hurdles are overcome,
average annual renewable capacity additions are one-quarter higher in
the period to 2026 than is forecast in the main case.

[However, even **this faster deployment would still fall well short** of
what would be needed in a global pathway to net zero emissions by
mid-century.]{.underline} That would [require renewable power capacity
additions over the period 2021-26 to average almost double the rate of
the report's main case.]{.underline} It would also mean growth in
biofuels demand averaging four times higher than in the main case, and
renewable heat demand almost three times higher.

[The main mitigation scenarios in the IPCC's new report

[These are]{.underline} both [important parts]{.underline} of a
solution, [but they are **harder and harder to deploy as they constitute
more of the power grid.**]{.underline} That's [because the outputs of
wind and solar sources]{.underline} **[vary ― between day and

**desperately needed technologies**]{.underline} [to **affordably

[are]{.underline} **[still developing]{.underline}**. Furthermore,

also [move us in the right direction **without getting close to the
goal.**]{.underline} [Individuals can stop eating]{.underline} [meat and
start taking public transportation]{.underline}. Air conditioners can
become more efficient. Farmers can change fertilizer practices.
[But]{.underline} all of [these]{.underline} put together [**won't do
nearly enough, and time is running out.** Here's a different idea: Let's
look at countries or regions that have]{.underline} **[successfully cut
carbon emissions]{.underline}**. For the all-important electricity
sector, the website electricitymap.org shows [how many grams of carbon
pollution a region creates for each kilowatt-hour of electricity it
generates. For the world, the average is **now about 500**]{.underline}.
[It needs to **drop below 50**]{.underline} within a couple of decades
to prevent disaster. In this effort, the world can be divided into three
general tiers: places that use mostly coal, including Poland, India,
China and Australia (they produce about 700 to 800 grams CO2/kWh);
places that have mostly replaced coal with natural gas and some
renewables, such as the United States and Germany (about 500 grams;
California has reached 200-300 grams with great effort); and places that
have miraculously decarbonized their grids to below 50 grams. It's true
― **[some places have already reached that goal.]{.underline}** **[Only
two methods of electricity generation account for this]{.underline}**.
[Some]{.underline} countries such as Norway and Uruguay [are lucky
enough to have vast hydroelectric capacity]{.underline}. [**Most nations
don't,** and]{.underline} new [hydropower comes **at enormous
cost**]{.underline} to ecosystems. [The]{.underline} [other decarbonized
grids can be found in]{.underline} [places that **rely on nuclear
power**]{.underline}, [such as **France**]{.underline},
**[Sweden]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} **[Ontario]{.underline}**,
**[Canada]{.underline}**. [Nuclear power is **free of carbon
pollution**]{.underline}; [is **highly concentrated**]{.underline},
[which **minimizes environmental impacts**]{.underline} [such as those
from mining and waste; and]{.underline} **[operates 24/7 without needing
batteries]{.underline}**. Most importantly, **[it can scale up
rapidly]{.underline}** ― [exactly **what's needed to bring the IPCC's
goals out of fantasyland**. Based on our analysis of many countries'
experiences, what might take a century to do with renewables alone could
be done in 20 years with nuclear power.]{.underline} Isn't n-n-nuclear
too dangerous, too expensive, too creepy? Well, no. It's thousands of
times safer than coal, which kills hundreds of thousands of people each
year. Actually, [nuclear power is the safest form of energy ever used,
in terms of deaths per unit of energy. Nuclear also generates far less
waste than other energy sources, including renewables]{.underline}. [The
spent fuel]{.underline} [from a lifetime of electricity use by an
average American generated entirely from nuclear power **would fit in a
soda can.**]{.underline} Someday we'll bury it, but for now the waste
can be left safely in its dry casks, certified for a hundred years,
while we attend to bigger issues like saving the planet.

#### Won't crowd out renewables and even if it does those aren't feasible

**Hong**, Ph.D. in Sustainable energy network planning & analysis,

nuclear"
http://www.eastasiaforum.org/2015/05/21/a-sustainable-south-korea-should-stick-with-nuclear/

Since the 1970s, nuclear power has provided cheap, stable and clean
electricity that has fuelled South Korea's rapid economic growth.
Currently, 23 nuclear power plants with a total capacity of 21 gigawatts
of electric energy are generating 27 per cent of South Korea's total
electricity needs. The wholesale price of nuclear power, US\$52 per
megawatt hour (MWh) in 2014, is still cheaper than coal (US\$61/MWh)
without any form of carbon pricing. [Nuclear power]{.underline}, which
**[is a zero-emission source]{.underline}**, [also has limited
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions]{.underline} at below 500 kilograms per
megawatt hour each year. A fire drill is underway at the Weolseong
Nuclear Power Complex in Gyeongju, North Gyeongsang Province, on 28
October 2014. (Photo: AAP) [Is renewable energy a viable
alternative]{.underline} to coal and nuclear in South Korea? [**The
simple answer is no.** There are]{.underline} already **[no rivers in
South Korea]{.underline}** [that flow to the ocean without passing
through a hydropower station]{.underline}. [Solar power is not feasible
**due to low levels of solar irradiance.**]{.underline} And [even if all
South Korea's wetlands were used for tidal power]{.underline}, [all the
terrestrial and marine natural parks were changed to wind farms and all
buildings were covered by photovoltaic cells, the maximum electricity
generation from renewables **could not provide more than 30 per cent of
total electricity consumed in 2010.**]{.underline} Since 2011 there have
been a series of nuclear-related events that could change not only South
Korea's future nuclear policy, but also its environmental and economic
sustainability. The Fukushima-Daiichi nuclear accident prompted
aggressive anti-nuclear movements. This could have been a blow to South
Korea's nuclear industry, but there was practically no adverse impact. A
survey conducted a year after the accident found that about 90 per cent
of respondents still understood the need for nuclear power and about 80
per cent agreed with maintaining or increasing the share of nuclear
energy in South Korea. To safeguard public support for nuclear power,
the government has spent US\$1 billion on safety measures to improve
technological systems, including higher seismic resistance design
requirements that well exceed the strongest earthquake ever observed in
South Korea. But the South Korean government still decided to reduce the
planned nuclear capacity share from 41 per cent to 29 per cent by 2035
after considering 'public emotion'. This decision was not based on any
scientific or economic reasoning and did not even match with the public
consensus. Due to this decision, coal power capacity will increase by 85
per cent compared with 2012, while the current share of renewables will
be maintained. This change does not align with the national climate
change policy target of reducing GHG emissions by 30 per cent compared
with 'business as usual' by 2035. In fact, to reduce the electricity
sector's GHG emissions while maintaining cheap prices, the share of
nuclear power capacity needs to increase by over 50 gigawatts --- or
more than 70 per cent of total electricity consumption --- by 2035.
Given the current construction trend of 1.4 gigawatts per year, this
target is achievable. But financing the additional nuclear power plants
would cost about \$US55 billion. Increasing the share of nuclear power
could cause two additional problems: spent-fuel management and aged
nuclear plants. By the end of 2014, overall accumulated spent-fuel in
South Korea amounted to about 80 per cent of the total storage capacity.
Between 2023 and 2029, 12 nuclear power plants with the capacity of 9.7
gigawatts will reach their expiration date. At the end of April 2015,
the US and South Korea signed a new US--South Korea Civil Nuclear
Agreement. The details have not yet been fully revealed, but this
agreement is regarded as the most important move so far in dealing with
spent fuel in South Korea. Since South Korea imports all its nuclear
fuel, pyro-processing --- which is partly allowed by the agreement ---
would be the ideal approach for dealing with spent fuel while securing a
stable nuclear fuel supply. In the long term, new generation IV reactor
technologies that will be available commercially before 2030 in South
Korea could provide a technical solution for these issues. These
technologies, coupled with full fuel recycling, can generate a huge
amount of energy from spent fuel. The advanced reactors also have
inherent passive safety features that do not require any external
manipulation in the case of an emergency. But a delicate medium-term
plan is also needed to extend the reactors' lifespans. This plan should
focus not only on technical issues but also on regaining public trust
after widely publicised corruption scandals. After the issue of forged
evaluation documents was reported in 2012, installed service parts with
fake certificates were re-evaluated and replaced, following an intense
investigation. There is no simple, short-term answer to tackling the
endemic transparency and corruption problems in South Korea. In the long
term, a public body with fairness, like a nuclear safety commission,
must be established to monitor nuclear power plants, alongside internal
measures proposed and implemented by KHNP. [South Korea must embrace
nuclear power for environmental]{.underline} and economic [reasons.
Contrary to the expectations of many 'green' organisations]{.underline}
in Korea, a [nuclear phase-out policy **will not increase the share of
renewables**]{.underline}. Instead, [it will increase coal power
production to maintain the price of electricity, while **abandoning the
hope of a more sustainable future**]{.underline}. [The main issues
surrounding nuclear power in South Korea are social and institutional
problems, not technological issues]{.underline}. To ensure a sustainable
future for South Korea, public trust must be regained and issues
concerning the safe management of nuclear power plants must be resolved.

#### US leadership prevents extinction from meltdowns and nuclear terrorism

In the 26 years since the meltdown of the nuclear reactor at Chernobyl
in Soviet-era Ukraine, the nuclear power industry has strengthened its
safety practices. Over the past decade, growing concerns about global
warming and energy independence have actually strengthened support for
nuclear energy in the United States and many nations around the world.
Yet despite these trends, the civil nuclear enterprise remains fragile.
Following Fukushima, opinion polls gave stark evidence of the public's
deep fears of the invisible force of nuclear radiation, shown by public
opposition to the construction of new nuclear power plants in close
proximity. It is not simply a matter of getting bet­ter information to
the public but of actually educating the public about the true nature of
nuclear radiation and its risks. Of course, [[the **immediate
task**]{.mark} of the nuclear power component of the enterprise
[is]{.mark} to strive for the best possible **safety** record. The
overriding objective could not be more clear: **[no more
Fukushimas]{.mark}**. **Another issue**]{.underline} that must be
[resolved involves the]{.underline} **[continued
effectiveness]{.underline}** of a policy of deterrence that remains
primarily dependent on nuclear weapons, [[and the]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[hazards]{.underline}** [these weapons pose due to the]{.underline}
**[[spread of nuclear tech]{.mark}nology and material]{.underline}**.
[[There is]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[growing]{.underline}]{.mark}**
apprehension about the **[[determination of
terrorists]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[to get]{.mark} their hands on
weapons or, for that matter, on the special **[nuclear
material]{.mark}** --- plutonium and highly enriched uranium --- that
fuels them in the **most challenging step** toward develop­ing a
weapon]{.underline}. The [global effects]{.underline} of a regional war
between nuclear-armed adversaries such as India and Pakistan [would also
wield an enormous impact]{.underline}, potentially involving radioactive
fallout at large distances caused by a limited number of nuclear
explosions. This is true as well for [[nuclear radiation from a reactor
explosion]{.underline}]{.mark} --- **[fallout at large distances [would
have a serious societal impact]{.mark}]{.underline}** on the nuclear
enterprise. [There is little understanding of the reality and poten­tial
danger of consequences if such an event were to occur halfway around the
world]{.underline}. An effort should be made to prepare the public by
providing information on how to respond to such an event. An active
nuclear diplomacy has grown out of the Cold War efforts to regulate
testing and reduce superpower nuclear arsenals. There is now a welcome
focus on rolling back nuclear weapons proliferation. Additional
important measures include the Nunn-Lugar program, started in 1991 to
reduce the nuclear arsenal of the former Soviet Union. Such initiatives
have led to greater investment by the United States and other
governments in better security for nuclear weapons and material
globally, including billions of dollars through the g8 Global
Partnership Against the Spread of Weapons and Materials of Mass
Destruction. The commitment to improving security of all dangerous
nuclear material on the globe within four years was made by 47 world
leaders who met with Presi­dent Obama in Washington, D.C., in April 2010;
this commitment was reconfirmed in March 2012 at the Nuclear Security
Summit in Seoul, South Korea. Many specific commitments made in 2010
relating to the removal of nuclear materials and conversion of nuclear
research reactors from highly enriched uranium to low-enriched uranium
fuel have already been accomplished, along with increasing levels of
voluntary commitments from a diverse set of states, improving prospects
for achieving the four-year goal. Three principles It is evident that
globally, the nuclear enterprise faces new and increasingly difficult
challenges. Successful leadership in national security policy will
require a continu­ous, diligent, and multinational assessment of these
newly emerging risks and consequences. In view of the seriousness of the
potentially deadly consequences associated with nuclear weapons and
nuclear power, we emphasize the importance of three guiding principles
for efforts to reduce those risks globally: First, the calculations used
to assess nuclear risks in both the military and the civil sectors are
fallible. Accurately analyzing events where we have little data,
identifying every variable associated with risk, and the possibility of
a single variable that goes dangerously wrong are all factors that
complicate risk calculations. Governments, industry, and concerned
citizens must constantly reexamine the assumptions on which safety and
security measures, emergency preparations, and nuclear energy production
are based. When dealing with very low-probability and high-consequence
operations, we typically have little data as a basis for making
quantitative analyses. It is therefore difficult to assess the risk of a
nuclear accident and what would contribute to it, and to identify
effective steps to reduce that risk. It\'s important to remember that
the calculations used to assess nuclear risks in the military and civil
sectors are fallible. In this context, it is possible that a single
variable could exceed expec­tations, go dangerously wrong, and simply
overwhelm safety systems and the risk assessments on which those systems
were built. This is what happened in 2011 when an earthquake, followed
by a tsunami --- both of which exceeded expectations based on history
--- overwhelmed the Fuku­shima complex, breaching a number of safeguards
that had been built into the plant and triggering reactor core meltdowns
and radiation leaks. This in turn exposed the human factor, which is
hard to assess and can dramatically change the risk equation. Cultural
habits and regulatory inadequacy inhibited rapid decision-making and
crisis management in the Fukushima disaster. A more nefarious example of
the human factor would be a determined nuclear terrorist attack
specifically targeting either the military or civilian component of the
nuclear enterprise. Second, [risks associated with]{.underline} nuclear
weapons and [nuclear power will]{.underline} likely [grow substantially
as]{.underline} nuclear weapons and [civilian nuclear energy production
technology spread in unstable regions of the world where the potential
for conﬂict is high.]{.underline} [States that are **new to the
nuclear** enterprise may **not have effective nuclear
safeguards**]{.underline} [to secure nuclear]{.underline} weapons and
[materials]{.underline} --- including a developed fabric of early
warning systems and nuclear confidence-building measures that could
increase warn­ing and decision time for leaders in a crisis --- [or the
capability to safely manage and regulate the construction and operation
of new civilian reactors. **Hence** there is a **growing risk** of
accidents]{.underline}, mistakes, [or]{.underline} miscal­culations
involving nuclear weapons, and of regional wars or **[nuclear
ter­rorism]{.underline}**. **[The consequences would be
horrific]{.underline}**: A Hiroshima-size nuclear bomb detonated in a
major city could kill a half-million people and result in \$1 trillion
in direct economic damage. On the civil side of the nuclear ledger, the
sobering paradox is this: While an accident would be con­siderably less
devastating than the detonation of a nuclear weapon, [the risk of an
accident occurring is probably higher]{.underline}. Currently, 1.4
billion people live without electricity, and by 2030 the global demand
for energy is projected to rise by about 25 percent. With the added need
to mini­mize carbon emissions, [nuclear power reactors will become
increasingly attractive alternative sources for electric
power]{.underline}, especially for develop­ing nations. [These
**[countries]{.mark}**]{.underline}, in turn, [will **[need]{.mark}** to
meet the challenge of **developing**]{.underline} appropriate
governmental institutions and the infrastruc­ture, expertise, and
experience to support nuclear power efforts with [[a]{.mark} suitably
**[high standard of safety]{.mark}**.]{.underline} As the world
witnessed in Fukushima, a nuclear power plant accident can lead to the
spread of dangerous radia­tion, massive civil dislocations, and billions
of dollars in cleanup costs. Such an event can also fuel widespread
public skepticism about nuclear institutions and technology. Some
developed nations --- notably Germany --- have interpreted the Fukushima
accident as proof that they should abandon nuclear power altogether,
primarily by prolonging the life of existing nuclear reactors while
phasing out nuclear-produced electricity and developing alternative
energy sources. Third, we need to understand that no nation is immune
from risks involving nuclear weapons and nuclear power within their
borders. There were 32 so-called "Broken Arrow" accidents --- nuclear
accidents that do not pose a danger of an outbreak of nuclear war ---
involving U.S. weapons between 1950 and 1980, mostly involving U.S.
Strategic Air Command bombers and earlier bomb designs not yet
incorporating modern nuclear detonation safety designs. The U.S. no
longer maintains a nuclear-armed, in-air strategic bomber force, and the
record of incidents is greatly reduced. In several cases, accidents such
as the North Caro­lina bomber incident came dangerously close
[[to]{.mark} triggering catastrophes]{.underline}, with
[disaster]{.underline} **[[avert]{.mark}ed]{.underline}** [simply by
**luck**]{.underline}. The United States has had an admirable safety
record in the area of civil nuclear power since the 1979 Three Mile
Island accident in Pennsylvania, yet [**safety concerns
persist**.]{.underline} One of the critical assumptions in the design of
the Fukushima reactor complex was that, if electrical power was lost at
the plant and back-up generators failed, power could be restored within
a few hours. The combined one-two punch of the earthquake and tsunami,
however, made the necessary repairs impossible. In the United States
today, some nuclear power reactors are designed with a comparably short
window for restoring power. After Fukushima, this is an issue that
deserves action --- especially in light of our own Hurricane Katrina
expe­rience, which rendered many affected areas inaccessible for days in
2005, and the August 2011 East Coast earthquake that shook the North
Anna nuclear power plant in Mineral, Virginia, beyond expectations based
on previous geological activity. Reducing risks To reduce these nuclear
risks, we offer four related recommendations that should be adopted by
the nuclear enterprise, both military and civilian, in the United States
and abroad. First, the reduction of nuclear risks requires every level
of the nuclear enterprise and related military and civilian
organizations to embrace the importance of safety and security as an
overarching operating rule. This is not as easy as it sounds. To a war
fighter, more safety and control can mean less reliability and
availability and greater costs. For a com­pany or utility involved in the
construction or operation of a nuclear power plant, more safety and
security can mean greater regulation and higher costs. The absence of a
culture of safety and security is perhaps the most reliable indicator of
an impending disaster. But [**the absence of a culture of safety and
security**, in which priorities and meaningful standards are set and
rigorous discipline and accountability are enforced, is perhaps the
**most reliable indicator of [an impending
disaster]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In August 2007, after a b-52 bomber
loaded with six nuclear-tipped cruise missiles flew from North Dakota to
Louisiana without anyone realizing there were live weapons on board,
then Secretary of Defense Robert Gates fired both the military and
civilian heads of the U.S. Air Force. His action was an example of
setting the right priorities and enforcing accountability, but the
reality of the incident shows that greater incorporation of a safety and
security culture is needed. Second, independent regulation of the
nuclear enterprise is crucial to setting and enforcing the safety and
security rule. In the United States today, the nuclear regulatory system
--- in particular, the Nuclear Regu­latory Commission (nrc) --- is
credited with setting a uniquely high standard for independent
regulation of the civil nuclear power sector. This is one of the keys to
a successful and safe nuclear program. Effec­tive regulation is even more
crucial when there are strong incentives to keep operating costs down
and keep an aging nuclear reactor fleet in operation, a combination that
could create conditions for a catastrophic nuclear power plant failure.
Careful attention is required to protect the nrc from regulatory capture
by vested interests in government and industry, the latter of which
funds a high percentage of the nrc's budget. In too many countries,
strong, independent regulatory agencies are not the norm. The
independent watchdog organization advising the Japanese government was
working with Japanese utilities to influence public opin­ion in favor of
nuclear power. [Strengthening **the**]{.underline}
**[I]{.underline}**nternational **[A]{.underline}**tomic
**[E]{.underline}**nergy **[A]{.underline}**gency (iaea) [so that it
**can play a** greater **role in civil nuclear safety and security would
also help reduce risks**]{.underline},[and will require **substantially
greater authorities**]{.underline} [to address]{.underline} both
**[safety and security]{.underline}**, and most importantly, more
resources for an agency whose budget is only €333 million, with only
one-tenth of that total devoted to nuclear safety and security. In
addition, **[[exporting]{.underline}]{.mark}** "**[[best
practices]{.underline}]{.mark}**" **[[of the U.S.]{.underline}]{.mark}**
Nuclear Regulatory Commission --- **[that is, [lessons of nuclear
regulation, oversight, and safety learned over many]{.mark} decades ---
to other countries would pay a huge safety dividend.]{.underline}**
Third, independent peer review should be incorporated into all aspects
of the nuclear enterprise. On the weapons side, independent **[experts
in the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates --- [from both
within and outside the various]{.underline} concerned
[organizations]{.underline} --- [are relied on to review]{.underline} or
"red team" [each other, rigorously challenging and debating weapons and
systems safety, and communicating these points up and down the
line.]{.underline} The Institute of Nuclear Power Operations (inpo)
provides strong peer review and oversight of the civil nuclear sector in
the United States. Its global counterpart, the World Association of
Nuclear Operators (wano), should give a higher priority to further
strengthening its safety operations, in particular its peer review
process, learning from the experiences of the United States and other
nations. [[Strong]{.underline}]{.mark} outside [[peer
review]{.underline}]{.mark} --- combined with an enhanced capacity to
arrange fines based on incidents occurring in far distant countries ---
[[would help states entering the world of high-consequence

#### Resurrecting commercial leadership solves safe global non-prolif regime 

**Banks 13** \["The Decline of America's Civil Nuclear Industry and its
Impact on Our National Security", February 9, 2013, Dave Banks, a policy
advisor to Heartland and the Director of D.C. Operations for the
Alliance of Wise Energy Decisions\]

In reality[, [America's nuclear energy industry is in **rapid
decline**]{.mark}]{.underline} [relative to its foreign
competitors.]{.underline} With the aging of our civil nuclear fleet and
the lack of new [builds, America's nuclear program has **sharply
contracted** over the last few decades.]{.underline} In the 1980s, for
example, 100 percent of equipment for U.S. nuclear plants was
manufactured in America, compared to less than 25 percent today.
Moreover, the [[U.S.]{.mark} share of global [nuclear]{.mark}
[exports]{.mark} [decreased]{.mark} significantly]{.underline} between
1994 and 2008, according to a U.S. government report. Specifically, [the
U.S. share of sensitive nuclear material exports declined]{.underline}
from roughly 30 to 10 percent, [and the country's share of exports of
nuclear reactors,]{.underline} major components, and equipment
[dropped]{.underline} from 11 to 7 percent.¶ There are a number of
reasons for the demise of the sector, but [chief among them
are]{.underline} [financing hurdles and cheaper forms of electricity
generation, as well as the failure to find a permanent repository for
high-level nuclear waste.]{.underline} More recently, cheap shale gas
has become a threat to the continued operation of existing reactors --
not just a deterrent to new construction. Duke Energy's recent decision
to shut down its nuclear plant in Florida, instead of repairing it was
largely due to the economic benefits of fuel switching to natural gas.
And late last year, Dominion announced its intention to shut down its
nuclear plant in Wisconsin -- a move that was also blamed on the
abundance of shale gas.¶ Although energy market observers understand why
our civil nuclear program is suffering, most of them do not appreciate
its impact on U.S. national security, specifically on our ability to
shape the global non-proliferation regime. And likewise, many [nuclear
proliferation experts do not appreciate the fact that [U.S.
influence]{.mark} [in managing prolif]{.mark}eration issues [is]{.mark}
largely [dependent on the **health of our civil nuclear
sector**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Certainly, most fail to recognize [the
primary reason why America possessed the power to define the nuclear
proliferation agenda in the first place --]{.underline} [[the **dominant
role** held by U.S. companies in providing]{.mark} civil [nuclear
energy]{.mark} technology and services throughout the
world]{.underline}.¶ Some [free]{.underline} market leaders would argue
that the American consumer would be better off buying foreign made
nuclear technologies if those goods were developed reliably at a lower
cost. However, [nuclear technology is not the average
widget]{.underline} or gadget on sale at Target or Best Buy. [The
production of fissile material]{.underline}, which [can be used to make
weapons]{.underline}, is inherently linked to civil nuclear energy
programs because [it is a by-product that cannot be avoided with light
water reactors.]{.underline}¶ Unfortunately, many of our elected and
senior officials mistakenly assume that America will always have a
significant diplomatic ability to shape global non-proliferation issues.
However, [[Washington's power to ensure]{.mark} that other [governments
follow non-prolif]{.mark}eration [guidelines will]{.mark} **[fall
rapidly]{.mark}** if we become an insignificant player in providing
related technology and services]{.underline}.¶ Even now,
[[countries]{.mark} that are [looking to build]{.mark} their own
[nuclear]{.mark} programs [are turning]{.mark} less and [less to
Washington]{.mark} for guidance]{.underline}. Instead, [**they are
engaging our foreign competitors**, who benefit from extensive state
subsidies and can offer turn-key services and fuel take-back
program]{.underline}s. And [if [nuclear-armed countries]{.mark} wish to
help others build bombs, they can take advantage]{.underline} of
loopholes in the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) [b**y [expor]{.mark}ting
[nuclear tech]{.mark}**nologies and services [that allow a country to
develop]{.mark} the [capacity]{.mark} to do so.]{.underline}

[In contrast to the conventional wisdom]{.underline}, this article
argues that the **[link between nuclear energy programs and
proliferation is overstated]{.underline}**. Although [such programs
increase the technical capacity of a state to build nuclear
weapons]{.underline}, they also [have important countervailing political
effects that limit the odds of proliferation.]{.underline} Speciªcally,
[nuclear energy programs (1) **increase the likelihood** that a parallel
nuclear **weapons program is detected** and attracts outside
nonproliferation pressures, and (2) **increase the costliness of
nonproliferation sanctions.** These countervailing mechanisms are
largely the product of policy interventions by actors who have worried
since the beginning of the nuclear age that nuclear energy programs
would lead to proliferation.]{.underline} In this sense, [the
long-standing belief that the expansion of such programs would result in
an expansion in the number of nuclear weapons states might be at least
partially viewed as a **self-defeating prophecy**]{.underline}, much
like policymakers' beliefs in nuclear domino effects or tipping points.7
Understanding the relationship between nuclear energy and the spread of
nuclear weapons may be particularly pressing now for three reasons.
[First, nuclear energy has the potential to **reduce carbon emissions**
and thereby help **combat climate change**]{.underline}, potentially
making it an attractive option.8 Second, many observers have argued that
the world is in the midst of a nuclear energy "renaissance," or at least
it was prior to the 2011 Tohoku tsunami, which caused nuclear meltdowns
at Japanese nuclear power plants in Fukushima and dampened global
enthusiasm for nuclear energy.9 Third, [many countries currently
developing nuclear energy programs are located in unstable security
environments]{.underline} (e.g., Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and the
United Arab Emirates), which [may provide them with incentives to seek
nuclear weapons]{.underline}. Even though the [relative costs of nuclear
energy production have grown over time, particularly as natural gas has
become cheaper]{.underline},10 there are still [dozens of countries that
are at different stages of considering or developing nuclear energy
programs]{.underline}.11 As a result, although such programs are
unlikely to spread as quickly as many analysts anticipated prior to the
Fukushima disaster, additional countries are still likely to pursue them
over time.

#### Warming causes prolif 

**Schwartz and Randall 3** (Peter -- Chair Global Business Network, and
Doug -- Co-Head Global Business Network's Consulting Practice, "An
Abrupt Climate Change Scenario and Its Implications for United States
National Security", October 2003,
http://www.mindfully.org/Air/2003/Pentagon-Climate-Change1oct03.htm)

The two most likely reactions to a sudden drop in carrying capacity due
to climate change are defensive and offensive. The United States and
Australia are likely to build defensive fortresses around their
countries because they have the resources and reserves to achieve
self-sufficiency. With diverse growing climates, wealth, technology, and
abundant resources, the United States could likely survive shortened
growing cycles and harsh weather conditions without catastrophic losses.
Borders will be strengthened around the country to hold back unwanted
starving immigrants from the Caribbean islands (an especially severe
problem), Mexico, and South America. Energy supply will beshored up
through expensive (economically, politically, and morally) alternatives
such as nuclear, renewables, hydrogen, and Middle Eastern contracts.
[Pesky skirmishes over **fishing** rights, **agricultural support**, and
**disaster relief** will be commonplace]{.underline}. Tension between
the U.S. and Mexico rise as the U.S. reneges on the 1944 treaty that
guarantees water flow from the Colorado River. Relief workers will be
commissioned to respond to flooding along the southern part of the east
coast and much drier conditions inland. Yet, even in this continuous
state of emergency the U.S. will be positioned well compared to others.
The intractable problem facing the nation will be calming the mounting
military tension around the world. [[As]{.mark} **famine**, **disease**,
and **[weather-]{.mark}related [disasters]{.mark}** [strike]{.mark} due
to]{.underline} the abrupt [climate change]{.underline}, many countries'
[[needs will **exceed**]{.underline}]{.mark} their **[carrying
[capacity]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. [This will]{.underline}]{.mark}
[create a sense of **[desperation]{.mark}**, which is likely to [lead
to]{.mark} **[offensive aggression]{.mark}** in order to reclaim
balance.]{.underline} [[Imagine]{.underline}]{.mark} eastern
[[Europe]{.mark}an countries, struggling to feed their populations with
a falling supply of food, water, and energy, **eyeing Russia**, whose
population is already in decline, for access to its grain, minerals, and
energy supply]{.underline}. [[Or]{.underline}]{.mark},
[picture]{.underline} [[Japan]{.mark}, suffering from **flooding** along
its coastal cities and **contamination** of its fresh water supply,
[eying Russia]{.mark}'s Sakhalin Island oil and gas reserves as an
energy source to power desalination plants and energy-intensive
agricultural processes.]{.underline} [[Envision Pakistan, India, and
China -- all armed with nuclear weapons --]{.underline}
**[skirmishing]{.underline}**]{.mark} [at their borders [over
**refugees**]{.mark}, access to shared]{.underline} [[**rivers**,
and]{.mark} arable **[land]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Spanish and
Portuguese fishermen might fight over fishing rights -- leading to
conflicts at sea. And, countries including the United States would be
likely to better secure their borders. With over 200 river basins
touching multiple nations, we can expect conflict over access to water
for drinking, irrigation, and transportation. The Danube touches twelve
nations, the Nile runs though nine, and the Amazon runs through
seven.[In this scenario, we can [expect **alliances** of
convenience]{.mark}]{.underline}. The United States and Canada may
become one, simplifying border controls. Or, Canada might keep its
hydropower---causing energy problems in the US. North and South Korea
may align to create one technically savvy and nuclear-armed entity.
Europe may act as a unified block -- curbing immigration problems
between European nations -- and allowing for protection against
aggressors. Russia, with its abundant minerals, oil, and natural gas may
join Europe. [[In this world]{.mark} of **warring states**, nuclear
arms]{.underline} [[**proliferation** is
**inevitable**]{.underline}]{.mark}. As cooling drives up demand,
existing [hydrocarbon supplies are stretched thin]{.underline}. With a
scarcity of energy supply -- and a growing need for access \--
[[**nuclear energy** will become a **critical source of power**, and
this will **accelerate nuclear proliferation**]{.mark} as countries
develop **enrichment** and **reprocessing capabilities** to ensure their
**national security**]{.underline}. [China, India, Pakistan, Japan,
South Korea, Great Britain, France, and Germany will all have nuclear
weapons capability, as will Israel, Iran, Egypt, and North Korea.
[]{.mark}Managing the **military** and **political tension**,
occasional]{.underline} [skirmishes, and **threat of war** will be a
**challenge**]{.underline}. Countries such as Japan, that have a great
deal of social cohesion (meaning the government is able to effectively
engage its population in changing behavior) are most likely to fair
well. Countries whose diversity already produces conflict, such as
India, South Africa and Indonesia, will have trouble maintaining order.
Adaptability and access to resources will be key. Perhaps the most
frustrating challenge abrupt climate change will pose is that we'll
never know how far we are into the climate change scenario and how many
more years -- 10, 100, 1000 -- remain before some kind of return to
warmer conditions as the thermohaline circulation starts up again. When
carrying capacity drops suddenly, civilization is faced with new
challenges that today seem unimaginable.

### AT: Grid

#### Nuclear energy solves grid stability

**Motta 16** \[Arthur, Professor of Nuclear Engineering and Materials

Deserves A Level Playing Field," ANS Nuclear Café, August 18, 2016,

[Nuclear power provides other benefits in addition to clean air.
**[Nuclear plants]{.mark} also [provide stability to the electrical
grid, as their output is constant and reliable]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.
[They are available]{.underline}]{.mark} [at nearly [all times and
especially in times of need]{.mark}]{.underline} -- for example, during
severe winter weather when coal deliveries may be disrupted.

Additionally, [nuclear power is a technology-intensive industry in which
the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [has traditionally led the
world]{.underline}. [[With each]{.mark} [closure]{.mark} of an operating
U.S. nuclear power plant, the [infrastructure]{.mark} built over the
past 50 year]{.underline}s -- including suppliers, vendors, operators,
maintenance and manpower -- [[becomes increasingly imperiled]{.mark} as
it serves a dwindling number of plants]{.underline}. **[If the industry
disappears here, it will be very difficult to rebuild as China and
Russia becomes world leaders in nuclear technology]{.underline}**.

Finally, nuclear power is also one of the rare industries that generates
many high-paying jobs for engineers and technicians, as well as
blue-collar jobs for plant workers -- all of which must be sited in the
United States. This is one reason why [regulators in New York recently
adopted a Clean Energy Standard that will provide significant yearly
subsidies]{.underline} through 2029 [to keep]{.underline} several
existing [reactors operating]{.underline}. Other states should consider
taking similar steps to recognize the benefits of nuclear power and
prevent premature plant closures. This would support their environmental
goals.

In sum, [there is a case for government intervention to improve the
economic competitiveness of nuclear plants and avoid early
closures.]{.underline} The nuclear industry does not need handouts, but
a [**[coherent U.S. energy policy should]{.mark} provide a level playing
field in the electric markets** by recognizing the essential
contributions that nuclear power plants make toward reducing greenhouse
gas emissions]{.underline}, **[[ensur]{.mark}ing [reliable electricity
and preserving grid stability]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}
**[Failure to act could foreclose the nuclear power
option]{.underline}** in this country and make the road to clean air and
energy independence in the future that much harder.

### AT: Nuclear Energy Bad

#### Cheap and ineffective Chinese reactors make their offense inevitable\-\--only the plan can solve

**Tickell 15** \[Oliver, science and environment journalist published in
numerous magazines including New Scientist, New Statesman and The
Economist, October 30, 2015, "Does China's Nuclear Boom Threaten a
Global Catastrophe?"
http://www.counterpunch.org/2015/10/30/does-chinas-nuclear-boom-threaten-a-global-catastrophe/\]

"**[[China shows the way to build nuclear reactors]{.mark} fast and
cheap]{.underline}**." That was the bullish headline in a Forbes
magazine article last week. [It went on to praise the scale of the
planned nuclear investment in China's new]{.underline} Five-Year Plan
that runs from 2016 to 2020. Under the plan the government is to invest
over US\$100 billion to build seven new reactors a year until 2030. "By
2050", James Conca wrote for Forbes, "nuclear power should exceed 350 GW
in that country, include about 400 new nuclear reactors, and have
resulted in over a trillion dollars in nuclear investment." Now Conca is
pretty enthusiastic about this. But **[the reality is [a potential
nuclear nightmare in the making]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Experience to
date shows that we should, on average, expect a major nuclear accident
to take place for every 3,000 to 4,000 years of reactor operation. And
with over 400 reactors running at once, it doesn't take long to clock up
those 3,000 years. In fact, [[you could]{.mark} reasonably [expect
a]{.mark} [major Chernobyl]{.mark}]{.underline} or Fukushima level
accident [[every]{.mark} [seven]{.mark}]{.underline} to ten
[[years]{.underline}]{.mark} -- [in China alone, if it pursues nuclear
build on that]{.underline} scale. Just how safe is China anyway Now [if
China had a fantastic record of safety in its construction and other
industries, maybe the odds should be made a bit longe]{.underline}r.
Swiss-style reactors might come in at only one big foulup every 10,000
years, for example. But that's not China. This August past we had the
massive fire and multiple explosions at the Port of Tianjin, that killed
almost 200 people and devastated several square kilometres of the
industrial zone. It later transpired that over 7,000 tonnes of hazardous
chemicals were stored there, among them sodium cyanide, calcium carbide
and ammonium and potassium nitrate, many of them kept in breach of
regulations. The owners had links to the highest echelons of the Chinese
state -- something that may have ensured very light touch regulation.
China has also experienced some recent high speed train crashes, the
worst in July 2011. Two bullet trains collided head-on on a viaductin
Wenzhou, Zhejiang province owing to faulty signalling, killing 40
people. The accident was blamed by the Chinese government itself on
"design flaws and sloppy management", according to the BBC. [China also
has a notoriously poor safety record in a range of industries from
construction to coal mining]{.underline}. If anything [[we]{.mark}
[should expect China's nuclear industry to be]{.mark} rather **[less
safe that the west]{.mark}ern average**]{.underline}, [especially [given
the cacophony of **new reactor designs**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}[and variations]{.underline} thereof [[under
construction]{.underline}]{.mark} simultaneously [at multiple
sites]{.underline} with absolutely no history of operation -- safe or
otherwise. Another factor is the secrecy that surrounds nuclear
contruction and operation in China. These matters simply are not
reported on other than in glowing terms in the official press. And
secrecy is all too often a cover for poor practice and cut corners. So
in fact there's a good case for thinking that Chinese reactors might
pop, not one in every 3,000 to 4,000 years of operation, but rather more
often. Every 2,000 years perhaps? At that rate we could expect a couple
of major nuclear catastrophes every decade. Cheap? Some scepticism is in
order Where Forbes celebrates the wonderfully low cost of Chinese
nuclear power we must also be a little sceptical. for example, "Six
Chinese-designed 1000 MW reactors at Yangjiang will be a huge nuclear
power base for China General Nuclear, and will cost only US\$11.5
billion for over 6000 MWe, a third of the cost in western countries." Or
at Changjang Unit 1, on Hainan Island, "The total cost of this first
pair of Chinese-designed 600 MW units is only about US\$3.15 billion."
While at Fangchenggang, "Six reactors are planned at this site at a
total cost of about US\$12 billion ... It seems as though 5 years and
about \$2 billion per reactor has become routine for China." How do we
know what these reactors really cost? The fact is, we don't. With
China's nuclear corporations under the control of various organs of
state including the Communist Party and the Peoples Liberation Army,
official statistics and accounts can simply not be relied upon. [Nuclear
construction in China must be cheaper]{.underline} than in the US and
Europe due to lower labour costs. **[But if it really is that much
[cheaper]{.mark} it [can only be at a huge safety
penalty]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. Take]{.mark} the construction problems
and delays at the two current EPR sites in Europe at Flamanville,
France, and Olkiluoto, Finland, both now running about three times over
original cost estimates. Many of the delays have been caused by safety
failures. Over, for example, the flawed metallurgy of the Flamanville
reactor vessel and concerns over the reliability of key valves in the
cooling system. Now of course, if you simple ignore such problems and
press ahead with construction to meet the targets set down a five-year
plan, construction is a whole lot quicker and cheaper. But the chances
of reactors popping in years to come is also considerably greater.
Tsunami risk -- not if but when It's also instructive to look at the map
of nuclear reactors scheduled for completion in the next decade provided
by Forbes. [The great bulk of them]{.underline} -- [[77
reactors]{.underline}]{.mark} in all -- [[are built along
China's]{.mark} east and south [coasts]{.mark}]{.underline}, for two
reasons: [[that's where the demand is,]{.mark} and that's where the
cooling water is readily available]{.underline}, from the sea. But of
course that's just the ones due to be completed in the next decade. If
the full plan for 400 reactors by 2050 is fulfilled, probably some 300
of them would be sea-facing. There are, of course, nuclear hazards to
inland reactors from flooding on the Yellow and Yangtse rivers and
tributaries. But a much greater danger arises from the sea. China's
south and east coasts face out to seismically active waters. And as the
Japanese discovered at Fukushima, nuclear power, earthquakes and
tsunamis make a dangerous combination. Interest in the danger of
tsunamis on China's south and east coast was stimulated by the two
Hengchun Earthquakes off Taiwan in December 2006, which damaged
buildings and disrupted communications by severing undersea cables. One
recent study put the risk of [a powerful tsunami]{.underline} greater
than 2m in height striking Hong Kong or Macau at about 10% over the
coming century, mainly due to seismic activity in the Manila Trench. But
head further north and east and the chances go up significantly to
13.34% at Shantou in Guangdong province. And it may be more than that,
the authors note: "This [probability estimate may increase with a recent
rise in the earthquake activities]{.underline}, which started with the
1999 Chi-Chi earthquake, because the Taiwan region has a earthquake
cycle time of around 80-100 years." What is certain is that **[[the
tsunami hazard is real and substantia]{.mark}l]{.underline}**.
Literature of historical seismic records of this region is "abundant",
the authors write. The northern Manila Trench near Taiwan is "is likely
to have avery large earthquake in the future. In addition the regionis a
volcanic belt. If volcano and earthquake occur in concert, a much larger
tsunami disaster would develop. "Although the southern part of the
Manila Trench is far away from the coast of China, the local historical
records of this region have many tsunami earthquakes up to the magnitude
of around 8.0. Since the oceanic portion of the South China Sea is
mostly deep, tsunamic waves generated in the Manila Trench region can
reach the coast of China with little loss in energy. "The wave energy
can then be released in the shallow water region, and can impose a
tremendous tsunami hazard to the coastal regions." [[The world's first
**truly global nuclear catastrophe**]{.mark}]{.underline} I have done no
study of [the tsunami vulnerability of]{.underline} all [the 300 nuclear
reactors that could end up being built along China's east and south
coasts]{.underline}. But at least one -- the CANDU reactor shown in the
photo (above right) at Qinshan, where seven reactors are currently
operational, looks vulnerable in the extreme. A[nd the consequences of a
really big earthquake and tsunami hitting China's coastal array of 300
nuclear reactors would be catastrophic]{.underline}. Many dozens of
reactors could be struck down, each doing their own 'Fukushima'. [This
would not just bring massive radioactive contamination to China's most
developed]{.underline}, prosperous, productive and populated [regions,
but spread around the world in air and sea currents to make the world's
first **truly global nuclear catastrophe**]{.underline}.

### AT: Terror

#### No impact of a terror attack on a nuclear plant

**WNA 16**, World Nuclear Association, \"Safety of Nuclear Power
Reactors\", May 2016,
www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/safety-of-nuclear-power-reactors.aspx

Since the World Trade Centre attacks in New York in 2001 [there has been
increased concern about the consequences of a large aircraft being used
to attack a nuclear facility]{.underline} with the purpose of releasing
radioactive materials. Various studies have looked at similar attacks on
nuclear power plants. They show that [nuclear reactors would be more
resistant to such attacks than virtually any other civil
installations]{.underline} -- see Appendix 3. A thorough study was
undertaken by the US Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) using
specialist consultants and paid for by the US Dept. of Energy. It
concludes that [[US reactor structures]{.mark} \"are robust and [(would)
protect the fuel from impacts of]{.mark} large commercial
[aircraft]{.mark}\".]{.underline}The analyses used a fully-fuelled
Boeing 767-400 of over 200 tonnes as the basis, at 560 km/h -- the
maximum speed for precision flying near the ground. The wingspan is
greater than the diameter of reactor containment buildings and the 4.3
tonne engines are 15 metres apart. Hence analyses focused on single
engine direct impact on the centreline -- since this would be the most
penetrating missile -- and on the impact of the entire aircraft if the
fuselage hit the centreline (in which case the engines would ricochet
off the sides). In each case [no part of the aircraft or its fuel would
penetrate the containment]{.underline}. Other studies have confirmed
these findings. [[Penetrating]{.mark} ([even]{.mark} relatively
[weak]{.mark}) [reinforced concrete requires]{.mark} multiple hits by
high speed [artillery shells]{.mark} or specially-designed \"bunker
busting\" ordnance -- both of which are well [beyond what
terrorists]{.mark} are likely to [deploy]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Thin-walled, slow-moving, hollow aluminum aircraft, hitting
containment-grade heavily-reinforced concrete disintegrate, with
negligible penetration. But further (see Sept 2002 Science paper and Jan
2003 Response & Comments), realistic assessments from decades of
analyses, lab work and testing, find that [**[the consequence of even
the worst realistic scenarios]{.mark}** -- core melting and containment
failure -- **[can cause few if any deaths]{.mark}** to the public,
regardless of the scenario that led to the core melt and containment
failure.]{.underline} This conclusion was documented in a 1981 EPRI
study, reported and widely circulated in many languages, by Levenson and
Rahn in Nuclear Technology.In 1988 Sandia National Laboratories in USA
demonstrated the unequal distribution of energy absorption that occurs
when an aircraft impacts a massive, hardened target. The test involved a
rocket-propelled F4 Phantom jet (about 27 tonnes, with both engines
close together in the fuselage) hitting a 3.7m thick slab of concrete at
765 km/h. This was to see whether a proposed Japanese nuclear power
plant could withstand the impact of a heavy aircraft. It showed how most
of the collision energy goes into the destruction of the aircraft itself
-- about 96% of the aircraft\'s kinetic energy went into the its
destruction and some penetration of the concrete -- while the remaining
4% was dissipated in accelerating the 700-tonne slab. The maximum
penetration of the concrete in this experiment was 60 mm, but comparison
with fixed reactor containment needs to take account of the 4% of energy
transmitted to the slab. See also video clip.As long ago as the late
1970s, the UK Central Electricity Generating Board considered the
possibility of a fully-laden and fully-fuelled large passenger aircraft
being hijacked and deliberately crashed into a nuclear reactor. The main
conclusions were that an airliner would tend to break up as it hit
various buildings such as the reactor hall, and that those pieces would
have little effect on the concrete biological shield surrounding the
reactor. Any kerosene fire would also have little effect on that shield.
In the 1980s in the USA, at least some plants were designed to take a
hit from a fully-laden large military transport aircraft and still be
able to achieve and maintain cold shutdown.The study of a 1970s US power
plant in a highly-populated area is assessing the [possible effects of a
successful terrorist attack which causes both meltdown of the core and a
large breach in the containment structure -- both extremely
unlikely]{.underline}. It [shows that [a large fraction of the most
hazardous radioactive isotopes]{.mark}]{.underline}, like those of
iodine and tellurium, [[would never leave the site.]{.mark} Much of the
radioactive material would stick to surfaces inside the containment or
becomes soluble salts that remain in the damaged containment building.
[Some radioactive material would]{.mark} nonetheless enter the
environment]{.underline} some hours after the attack in this extreme
scenario and affect areas up to several kilometres away. The extent and
timing of this means that with walking-pace evacuation inside this
radius it would not be a major health risk. [However it could leave
areas contaminated and hence displace people in the same way as a
natural disaster, giving rise to economic rather than health
consequences.]{.underline}Looking at spent fuel storage pools, similar
analyses showed no breach. Dry storage and transport casks retained
their integrity. \"There would be no release of radionuclides to the
environment\".Similarly, [the massive structures mean that **[any
terrorist attack]{.mark}** even inside a plant]{.underline} (which are
well defended) [and causing loss of cooling, core melting and breach of
containment **[would not result in any significant radioactive
releases]{.mark}**]{.underline}.However, while the main structures are
robust, [the [2001]{.mark} attacks did [lead to increased security
requirements]{.mark} and plants were required]{.underline} by NRC [to
install barriers, bulletproof security stations and other physical
modifications]{.underline} which in the USA are estimated by the
industry association to have cost some \$2 billion across the
country.See also Science magazine article 2002 and Appendix
3.Switzerland\'s Nuclear Safety Inspectorate studied a similar scenario
and reported in 2003 that the danger of any radiation release from such
a crash would be low for the older plants and extremely low for the
newer ones.[The conservative design criteria which caused most power
reactors to be shrouded by massive containment structures with
biological shield has provided peace of mind in a suicide terrorist
context]{.underline}. Ironically and as noted earlier, with better
understanding of what happens in a core melt accident inside, they are
now seen to be not nearly as necessary in that accident mitigation role
as was originally assumed.

### AT: Waste

#### Waste can't cause extinction\-\--less than 1% chance it kills even one person\-\--[medical spending]{.underline} from [nuclear industry taxes]{.underline} outweighs [80-fold]{.underline} 

Bernard L. **Cohen 12** -- Professor at the University of Pittsburgh,
(Bernard L. Cohen, Apr. 24, 2012, \"Nuclear Power Risk,\" accessed
1-4-2017, http://www.physics.isu.edu/radinf/np-risk.htm)

Radiation [[The principal risks]{.mark} associated with nuclear power
[arise from]{.mark} health effects of [radiation]{.mark}]{.underline}.
This radiation consists of subatomic particles traveling at or near the
velocity of light\-\--186,000 miles per second. They can penetrate deep
inside the human body where they can damage biological cells and thereby
initiate a cancer. If they strike sex cells, they can cause genetic
diseases in progeny. [Radiation occurs naturally]{.underline} in our
environment; [a typical person is, and always has been struck by 15,000
particles]{.underline} of radiation [every second from natural
sources]{.underline}, and an average medical X-ray involves being struck
by 100 billion. [While this may seem to be very dangerous, it is not,
because the probability]{.underline} for a particle [of radiation
entering]{.underline} a human body [to cause a cancer]{.underline} or a
genetic disease [is]{.underline} only [one]{.underline} chance
[in]{.underline} 30 million billion ([30 quintillion]{.underline}).
[Nuclear power technology produces materials that are]{.underline}
active in emitting radiation and are therefore called
\"[radioactive]{.underline}\". These materials can come into contact
with people principally through small releases during routine plant
operation, accidents in nuclear power plants, accidents in transporting
radioactive materials, and escape of radioactive wastes from confinement
systems. We will discuss these separately, but all of them taken
together, with accidents treated probabilistically, will eventually
expose the average American to about 0.2% of his exposure from natural
radiation. [Since natural radiation is estimated to cause about 1% of
all cancers, [radiation due to nuclear]{.mark}]{.underline} technology
**[[should]{.underline}]{.mark}** eventually **[[increase]{.mark} our
[cancer risk by 0.002%]{.mark}]{.underline}** (one part in 50,000),
[[reducing]{.mark} our [life expectancy by **less than one
hour**]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [By comparison, our loss of
life]{.underline}]{.mark} [expectancy [from **competitive electricity
generation**]{.mark} **technologies**]{.underline}, burning coal, oil,
or gas, [is estimated to [range]{.mark} from **3 [to 40
days]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [There has been much misunderstanding on
**genetic diseases due to radiation**]{.underline}. [The risks are
somewhat **less than the cancer risks**]{.underline}; [for example,
among]{.underline} the [Japanese A-bomb]{.underline}
[survivors]{.underline} from Hiroshima and Nagasaki, [there have been
about]{.underline} **[400 extra cancer deaths]{.underline}** **[among
the 100,000 people in the follow-up group]{.underline}**, [but there
have been **no extra genetic diseases**]{.underline} among their
progeny. [Since [there is no]{.mark} possible [way
for]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[cells]{.mark} in our bodies [to
distinguish between natural radiation and radiation from]{.mark} the
[nuclear]{.mark} industry, [the latter **cannot cause new types
of**]{.mark} **genetic [diseases or deformities]{.mark}**]{.underline}
(e.g., bionic man), **[[or threaten the \"human
race\".]{.underline}]{.mark}** Other causes of genetic disease include
delayed parenthood (children of older parents have higher incidence) and
men wearing pants (this warms the gonads, increasing the frequency of
spontaneous mutations). The genetic risks of nuclear power are
equivalent to delaying parenthood by 2.5 days, or of men wearing pants
an extra 8 hours per year. [[Much can be done to avert]{.mark} genetic
[disease]{.mark}s [utilizing]{.mark} currently [available]{.mark}
[tech]{.mark}nology; **[if 1% of]{.mark}**]{.underline} the **[[taxes
paid by the]{.mark} nuclear [industry were used
to]{.mark}]{.underline}** further **[[implement
this]{.underline}]{.mark}** technology, **[[80 cases of]{.mark} genetic
[disease would be averted for each]{.mark} case
[caused]{.mark}]{.underline}** by the nuclear industry. Reactor
accidents The nuclear power plant design strategy for preventing
accidents and mitigating their potential effects is \"defense in
depth\"\-\-- if something fails, there is a back-up system to limit the
harm done, if that system should also fail there is another back-up
system for it, etc., etc. Of course it is possible that each system in
this series of back-ups might fail one after the other, but the
probability for that is exceedingly small. The Media often publicize a
failure of some particular system in some plant, implying that it was a
close call\" on disaster; they completely miss the point of defense in
depth which easily takes care of such failures. Even in the Three Mile
Island accident where at least two equipment failures were severely
compounded by human errors, two lines of defense were still not
breached\-\-- essentially all of the radioactivity remained sealed in
the thick steel reactor vessel, and that vessel was sealed inside the
heavily reinforced concrete and steel lined \"containment\" building
which was never even challenged. It was clearly not a close call on
disaster to the surrounding population. The Soviet Chernobyl reactor,
built on a much less safe design concept, did not have such a
containment structure; if it did, that disaster would have been averted.
Risks from reactor accidents are estimated by the rapidly developing
science of \"probabilistic risk analysis\" (PRA). A PRA must be done
separately for each power plant (at a cost of \$5 million) but we give
typical results here: A fuel melt-down might be expected once in 20,000
years of reactor operation. In 2 out of 3 melt-downs there would be no
deaths, in 1 out of 5 there would be over 1000 deaths, and in 1 out of
100,000 there would be 50,000 deaths. The average for all meltdowns
would be 400 deaths. Since air pollution from coal burning is estimated
to be causing 10,000 deaths per year, there would have to be 25
melt-downs each year for nuclear power to be as dangerous as coal
burning. Of course deaths from coal burning air pollution are not
noticeable, but the same is true for the cancer deaths from reactor
accidents. In the worst accident considered, expected once in 100,000
melt-downs (once in 2 billion years of reactor operation), the cancer
deaths would be among 10 million people, increasing their cancer risk
typically from 20% (the current U.S. average) to 20.5%. This is much
less than the geographical variation\-\-- 22% in New England to 17% in
the Rocky Mountain states. Very high radiation doses can destroy body
functions and lead to death within 60 days, but such \"noticeable\"
deaths would be expected in only 2% of reactor melt-down accidents;
there would be over 100 in 0.2% of meltdowns, and 3500 in 1 out of
100,000 melt-downs. To date, the largest number of noticeable deaths
from coal burning was in an air pollution incident (London, 1952) where
there were 3500 extra deaths in one week. Of course the nuclear
accidents are hypothetical and there are many much worse hypothetical
accidents in other electricity generation technologies; e.g., there are
hydroelectric dams in California whose sudden failure could cause
200,000 deaths. Radioactive Waste The radioactive waste products from
the nuclear industry must be isolated from contact with people for very
long time periods. The bulk of the radioactivity is contained in the
[spent fuel]{.underline}, which [is]{.underline} quite **[small in
volume]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} therefore **[easily
handled]{.underline}** with great care. [This \"high level waste\" will
be converted to a rock-like form and emplaced in the natural habitat of
rocks]{.underline}, deep [underground]{.underline}. The average lifetime
of a rock in that environment is one billion years. [If]{.underline} the
[waste behaves like other rock, it is easily shown that]{.underline} the
[[waste]{.mark} generated by one nuclear power plant [will]{.mark}
**eventually**]{.underline}, **[[over millions of
years]{.underline}]{.mark}** (if there is no cure found for cancer),
[[cause]{.underline} **[one death]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[from 50
years of operation]{.underline}**. [By comparison, the [wastes from
coal]{.mark} burning plants that end up in the ground will eventually
[cause]{.mark} **[several thousand]{.mark} deaths** [from]{.mark}
generating [the **same amount of electricity**]{.mark}.]{.underline} The
much larger volume of much less radioactive (low level) waste from
nuclear plants will be buried at shallow depths (typically 20 feet) in
soil. If we assume that this material immediately becomes dispersed
through the soil between the surface and ground water depth (despite
elaborate measures to maintain waste package integrity) and behaves like
the same materials that are present naturally in soil (there is
extensive evidence confirming such behavior), [the death toll
from]{.underline} this [low level waste would be 5% of that from the
high level waste discussed in the previous paragraph.]{.underline} Other
Radiation Problems [The effects of routine releases of radioactivity
from nuclear plants depend]{.underline} somewhat [on how the spent fuel
is handled]{.underline}. [A typical estimate]{.underline} [is that they
may reduce our life expectancy by **15 minutes**]{.underline}. Potential
problems from accidents in transport of radioactive materials are
largely neutralized by elaborate packaging. A great deal of such
transport has taken place over the past 50 years and there have been
numerous accidents, including fatal ones. However, [[from
all]{.underline}]{.mark} of these [[accidents combined, there is **less
than a 1% chance that even a single death will ever result from
radiation**]{.mark} **exposure**]{.underline}. Probabilistic risk
analyses indicate that [we can expect]{.underline} **[less than one
death per century in U.S.]{.underline}** [from this source]{.underline}.

which will play a role in achieving a stable global population, can be

intervene deliberately and in a large-scale way in the workings of our

fundamentally alien to ours, and may vastly surpass our own in some or
even most domains---a development that would have uniquely unpredictable

It\'s no secret. [[Sooner or later, Earth\'s bell will be rung. **A
giant asteroid**]{.mark} or comet will [slam into the
planet]{.mark},]{.underline} as has happened many times before, and [[a
**deadly dark cloud** will envelop the globe]{.mark}, killing much of
whatever might have survived the initial impact. \"[We live on a small
planet covered with the bones of extinct species]{.mark}, proving that
such [catastrophes do occur routinely]{.mark},\" says]{.underline} J.
Richard [Gott,]{.underline} III, [a professor of astrophysics at
Princeton]{.underline} and author of \"Time Travel in Einstein\'s
Universe.\" Gott cites the presumably hardy Tyrannosaurus rex, which
lasted a mere 2.5 million years and was the victim of an asteroid
attack, as an example of what can happen if you don\'t plan ahead. But
[space rocks may not be the only threat. [**Epidemics**,]{.mark}
climatological [or **ecological catastrophes**]{.mark} or even man-made
disasters [could do our species]{.mark}]{.underline} in, Gott says. And
so, he argues, [[we need a life insurance policy to guarantee the
survival of the human race.]{.mark} \"[Spreading out into space gives us
more chance]{.mark}]{.underline}s,\" he says. And the time is now:
History instructs that technological hay should be made while the
economic sun shines. \"There is a danger we will end the human space
program at some point, leaving us stranded on the Earth,\" Gott warns.
\"History shows that expensive technological projects are often
abandoned after awhile. For example, the Ancient Egyptians quit building
pyramids[. So **[we should be colonizing space

December,
http://www.discover.com/issues/dec-04/features/survive-end-of-universe/)

A cold, dark universe is billions, if not trillions, of years in the
future. Between now and then, humans will face plenty of other
calamities: wars and pestilences, ice ages, asteroid impacts, and the
eventual consumption of Earth---in about 5 billion years---as our sun
expands into a red giant star. To last until the very end of the
universe, an advanced civilization will have to master interstellar
travel, spreading far and wide throughout the galaxy and learning to
cope with a slowing, cooling, darkening cosmos. [[The]{.mark}ir
[greatest challenge]{.mark} will be figuring out [**how to not be here
when the universe dies**,]{.mark} essentially [finding a way to]{.mark}
undertake the ultimate journey of [flee]{.mark}ing [this
universe]{.mark} for another]{.underline}. Such a plan may sound absurd.
But [there is [nothing in physics]{.mark} that [forbids such]{.mark} a
venture. [Einstein's theory of]{.mark} general [relativity allows
for]{.mark} the existence of **[wormholes]{.mark}**]{.underline},
sometimes called Einstein-Rosen bridges, [[that connect **parallel
universes**.]{.mark} Among theoretical and experimental physicists,
parallel universes are not science fiction. The [notion of the
multiverse]{.mark}]{.underline}---that our universe coexists with an
infinite number of other universes---[has [gained ground among working
scientists]{.mark}.]{.underline} The inflationary theory proposed by
Alan Guth of MIT, to explain how the universe behaved in the first few
trillionths of a second after the Big Bang, has been shown to be
consistent with recent data derived from WMAP. Inflation theory
postulates that the universe expanded to its current size inconceivably
fast at the very beginning of time, and it neatly explains several
stubborn cosmological mysteries, including why the universe is both so
geometrically flat and so uniform in its distribution of matter and
energy. Andrei [Linde]{.underline} of Stanford University
[has]{.underline} taken this idea a step further and [proposed
that]{.underline} the process of inflation may not have been a singular
event---that ["parent universes" may bud "baby universes" in a
continuous, never-ending cycle]{.underline}. If Linde's theory is
correct, cosmic inflations occur all the time, and [new universes are
forming even as you read these words.]{.underline} Naturally, the
proposal to eventually flee this universe for another one raises
practical questions. To begin with, where exactly would an advanced
civilization go?

But [the reality is that [an **asteroid**]{.mark} impact, a **[change

temperature]{.mark}** of Earth's climate [are]{.mark} all
[events]{.mark} that [we]{.mark} currently [cannot escape]{.mark}. There
is no back-up plan. We are]{.underline}, for better or worse, [tied to
the fate of this planet]{.underline}. [As history has shown, that's not
a good fate to be tied to. In]{.underline} fact on September 7, [2016 a
30-foot asteroid flew between the Earth and the Moon. Our most powerful
instruments]{.underline} only [detected it with two days notice. Two
days]{.underline}. If the asteroid was only 1000-foot wide, [[it would
**destroy all**]{.mark} human [**life** and we'd have no back-up]{.mark}
to get out of it.]{.underline} Even the White House is worried about it.
[[Five]{.underline}]{.mark}, yes five, [major [extinction events have
occurred]{.mark} on our planet that we know about. **[We're due for
another]{.mark}**]{.underline}. And when that happens, what's our
alternative? You can't move to another house. You can't buy survival,
even with a billion dollars in the bank. [The only way out, is up. [We
must find a way to become multi-planetary **if we want to save
humanity**]{.mark}]{.underline}, your family, and yes, even yourself.
Only this can restore the honor we seemed to have lost from the brave
days of the 60s, while also ensuring our survival. It's for the species,
folks. And as a species, we have not allowed ourselves the opportunity
to blast off for the stars. Only the space race in the 60s when we were
afraid enough of a self-inflicted global extinction event (read:
nuclear) that we put forth the funding required to launch into orbit and
onto our moon. We didn't have calculators back then, and now we have
supercomputers in our pocket, but no one is allowed out of our
atmosphere, save for a few communication and spy satellites. Doesn't
that make you mad? It's not some oppressive government that tells us no.
It's us. We pay our taxes. We elect leaders. Those leaders choose
Defense as the primary budget line item, but forget about defending
against the forthcoming apocalypse. Funding for NASA in the United
States has decreased from 4% of the national budget in the 60s to about
0.5% from 2010 onwards. That's just the money side. [But in order [to
move]{.mark} past this threshold from our home planet [to space]{.mark}
and then onto other planets, **[we need]{.mark}** **to do [two things:
Travel there. Survive. ]{.mark}**[Luckily]{.mark}]{.underline}, we can
simplify the problem of passing this barrier by sending machines in our
place. Like TARS from Interstellar, they can go places humans cannot and
explore the environment for habitability and resources, even in
particularly hostile conditions. Maybe not black hole hostile, but
definitely Mars hostile, as the Curiosity Rover has shown. Only now,
with [a few bold, private [startups are]{.mark} we [beginning]{.mark} to
see a [re-emergence of the space industry]{.mark}. We are about to pass
a few very important tests that allow us to explore and visit the
cosmos. The first is launching physical things into space. This is the
catalyst that will jump start a new space race.]{.underline} Prices of
sending cargo are falling dramatically, down to nearly \$500 per pound
of payload with SpaceX's Falcon 9 heavy re-usable rocket. Note that the
re-usable part is key. We can't throw away our "space car" every time we
Uber it. And once that becomes standard and cost-optimized we might be
able to get that down to \$10 per pound. Imagine what could happen when
it costs the same amount to ship something across town as it does into
space. The second, and this is just as important, is the wave of
autonomous machines. [Tesla has popularized the notion of self-driving
cars. SpaceX lands their rocket onto a small barge in the ocean
autonomously. Companies are buying startups in the space. Self-driving
will be our gift, our talisman, on the quest to save the species by
becoming multi-planetary.]{.underline} II. Shipping Ourselves to Space
The graph below is from the Founders Fund manifesto, showing the
[decreasing cost of launching something into space]{.underline}. It
begins with the 1960s US-versus-Russia space race and [extends to the
present day SpaceX-versus-Blue Origin reusable rocket race.]{.underline}
The cheapest method we have today is SpaceX's Falcon series rockets.
With the Falcon 9 Heavy, it's predicted [launching]{.underline} cargo
[into space will be cheaper than ever before]{.underline}, at \$750 per
pound of payload delivered to low earth orbit (LOE)on an expendable
rocket. You have to note here, however, that these statistics are as
cheap as possible. It costs more to deliver payload on a non-reusable
rocket, and on something that's further out than LEO, like
geosynchronous orbit, or to Mars. For example, based on SpaceX's
published pricing, it would be at least 4x more expensive to deliver far
less cargo to Mars. So what happens when we reduce that cost to \$10 per
pound? Namely, an explosion of startups, much like iOS. Instead of
pushing to production for your continuously deployed web and mobile
app[, we will see future developers push to production by deploying
physical things into space.]{.underline} "STAGE" takes on an entirely
new meaning for software developers when it means your automated
regression tests fail, it could blow up a rocket and hurt people on
board. [That's why [SpaceX and Blue Origins]{.mark} exist. To
[make]{.mark} this continuous-[deployment-to-space process as **cheap
and fast** as possible.]{.mark}]{.underline} [By]{.mark} Elon's
calculations, every 15 minutes. III. Self-Driving Space Explorers The
most successful products for space, at least in the beginning, will make
money by pushing this stuff into orbit. Things like science experiments
and new 3D printers. A company called Made in Space creates a number of
these products, including the empty box you see below used for sending
things up with Blue Origin. The box shown in gray is a specialized 3D
printer that works in zero gravity. Remember how most 3D printers work.
It squeezes out a single layer of liquid ooze, and then another, over
and over again until it builds up enough vertically that it creates an
object. This can be simple plastic or more esoteroic metals. But when
you're "dripping" something, held down in place by gravity, the entire
process has to be re-imagined for space. Things in zero-G would just
float away. Enter these chaps. [There's also the very real need for
**oxygen, food, water, and shelter from** the **harsh elements**. Funny
how we will end up recreating Maslow's Heirarchy in every new voyage or
planetoid we want to colonize.]{.underline} And space mining is off to
the races with the recent announcement of Deep Space Industry's
Prospector-1: Their vision is to extract water from asteroids and use
the chemical components to hydrate us, but also as oxygen (breathing)
and hydrogen (fuel). To do that, you have to identify candidate
asteroids, physically get to them, land and attach, and then do
surveying, prospecting, and extraction. In short, you're going to need
some level of self-driving capabilities to make this happen. And
wouldn't it be nice if it "just worked" right out of the box.
Unfortunately, in space you don't have fleets of these space craft,
millions of miles of training data, maps, or an internet connection to
the cloud so how the heck are deep learning algorithms going to work? I
don't think they will. **[And that's what I believe we need a better
approach.]{.underline}**

As I write these words, [suns are illuminating and heating empty rooms,
unused energy is being flushed down black holes, and our great common
endowment of **[negentropy]{.mark}** [is being irreversibly degraded
into entropy **on a cosmic scale**]{.mark}. [These are resources that an
advanced civilization could have used]{.mark}]{.underline} to create
value-structures, such as sentient beings living worthwhile lives. The
rate of this loss boggles the mind. One recent paper speculates, using
loose theoretical considerations based on the rate of increase of
entropy, that the loss of potential human lives in our own galactic
supercluster is at least \~10\^46 per century of delayed
colonization.\[1\] This estimate assumes that all the lost entropy could
have been used for productive purposes, although no currently known
technological mechanisms are even remotely capable of doing that. Since
the estimate is meant to be a lower bound, this radically unconservative
assumption is undesirable. We can, however, get a lower bound more
straightforwardly by simply counting the number or stars in our galactic
supercluster and multiplying this number with the amount of computing
power that the resources of each star could be used to generate using
technologies for whose feasibility a strong case has already been made.
We can then divide this total with the estimated amount of computing
power needed to simulate one human life. As a rough approximation, let
us say the Virgo Supercluster contains 10\^13 stars. One estimate of the
computing power extractable from a star and with an associated
planet-sized computational structure, using advanced molecular
nanotechnology\[2\], is 10\^42 operations per second.\[3\] A typical
estimate of the human brain's processing power is roughly 10\^17
operations per second or less.\[4\] Not much more seems to be needed to
simulate the relevant parts of the environment in sufficient detail to
enable the simulated minds to have experiences indistinguishable from
typical current human experiences.\[5\] Given these estimates, it
follows that the potential for approximately 10\^38 human lives is lost
every century that colonization of our local supercluster is delayed; or
equivalently, about 10\^29 potential human lives per second. While this
estimate is conservative in that it assumes only computational
mechanisms whose implementation has been at least outlined in the
literature, it is useful to have an even more conservative estimate that
does not assume a non-biological instantiation of the potential persons.
Suppose that about 10\^10 biological humans could be sustained around an
average star. Then the Virgo Supercluster could contain 10\^23
biological humans. This corresponds to a loss of potential equal to
about 10\^14 potential human lives per second of delayed colonization.
What matters for present purposes is not the exact numbers but the fact
that they are huge. Even with the most conservative estimate, assuming a
biological implementation of all persons, the potential for one hundred
trillion potential human beings is lost for every second of postponement
of colonization of our supercluster.\[6\] II. THE OPPORTUNITY COST OF
DELAYED COLONIZATION From a utilitarian perspective, [this **[huge loss
of potential human lives]{.mark}** constitutes a correspondingly huge
loss of potential value]{.underline}. I am assuming here that the human
lives that could have been created would have been worthwhile ones.
Since it is commonly supposed that even current human lives are
typically worthwhile, this is a weak assumption. Any civilization
advanced enough to colonize the local supercluster would likely also
have the ability to establish at least the minimally favorable
conditions required for future lives to be worth living. [[The effect on
total value]{.underline}]{.mark}, then, [[seems greater for actions that
accelerate tech]{.mark}nological [development than]{.mark} for
practically [any other]{.mark} possible [action. Advancing
tech]{.mark}nology]{.underline} (or its enabling factors, such as
economic productivity) [even by such a tiny amount [that it leads to
colonization]{.mark} of the local supercluster **[just one second
earlier]{.mark} than would otherwise have happened [amounts to bringing
about more than 10\^29 human live]{.mark}**[s]{.mark}]{.underline} (or
10\^14 human lives if we use the most conservative lower bound) [**[that
would not otherwise have existed]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Few other
philanthropic causes could hope to match that level of utilitarian
payoff.

nuclear war. [The **[peer-reviewed studies]{.mark}** they produced

in these studies [and]{.mark} their [findings **remain

Working at the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics at the
University of Colorado-Boulder, the Department of Environmental Sciences
at Rutgers, and the Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences at
UCLA, [these [scientists used **state-of-the-art**]{.mark} **computer
[modeling]{.mark}** to evaluate the consequences of a range of possible
nuclear conflicts]{.underline}. They began with a hypothetical war in
Southeast Asia, in which a total of 100 Hiroshima-size atomic bombs were
detonated in the cities of India and Pakistan. Please consider the
following images of Hiroshima, before and after the detonation of the
atomic bomb, which had an explosive power of 15,000 tons of TNT.

The detonation of [an **atomic bomb**]{.underline} with this explosive
power will instantly ignite fires over a surface area of three to five
square miles. In the recent studies, the scientists calculated that [the
blast, fire, and radiation from]{.underline} a war fought with 100
atomic bombs could produce direct fatalities comparable to all of those
worldwide in World War II, or to those once estimated [for [a
**"counterforce"**]{.mark} nuclear [war]{.mark}]{.underline} between the
superpowers. However, the long-term environmental effects of the war
[[could significantly disrupt]{.mark} the [global weather]{.mark} for at
least a decade, [which would]{.mark} likely [result in a vast global
famine]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[The scientists predicted that nuclear firestorms in the burning cities
would cause at least five million tons of black carbon smoke to quickly
rise above cloud level into the stratosphere, where it could not be
rained out]{.underline}. [The smoke would circle the Earth in less than
two weeks and would form a global stratospheric smoke layer that would
remain for more than a decade]{.underline}. The smoke would absorb
warming sunlight, which would heat the smoke to temperatures near the
boiling point of water, [producing ozone losses of 20 to 50 percent over
populated areas]{.underline}. This would almost double the amount of
UV-B reaching the most populated regions of the mid-latitudes, and it
would create UV-B indices unprecedented in human history. In North
America and Central Europe, the time required to get a painful sunburn
at mid-day in June could decrease to as little as six minutes for
fair-skinned individuals.

As the smoke layer blocked warming sunlight from reaching the Earth's
surface, [it would produce the coldest average surface temperatures in
the last 1,000 years]{.underline}. The scientists calculated that
[global food production would decrease by 20 to 40 percent during a
five-year period following such a war]{.underline}. Medical experts have
predicted that [the shortening of growing seasons and corresponding
decreases in agricultural production could cause up to two billion
people to perish from famine]{.underline}.

The climatologists also investigated the effects of [a nuclear war
fought with the **vastly more powerful** modern **thermonuclear
weapons** possessed by the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates,
[Russia, China, France, and England]{.underline}. Some of the
thermonuclear weapons constructed during the 1950s and 1960s were [1,000
times more powerful than an atomic bomb]{.underline}.

During the last 30 years, the average size of thermonuclear or
"strategic" nuclear weapons has decreased. Yet today, [each of the
approximately 3,540 strategic weapons deployed by the]{.underline}
[U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and Russia is seven to 80
times more powerful than the atomic bombs modeled in the India-Pakistan
study]{.underline}. The smallest strategic nuclear weapon has an
explosive power of 100,000 tons of TNT, compared to an atomic bomb with
an average explosive power of 15,000 tons of TNT.

[[Strategic]{.mark} nuclear [weapons produce **much larger**]{.mark}
**nuclear [firestorms]{.mark}** than do atomic bombs]{.underline}. For
example, [a standard Russian 800-kiloton warhead]{.underline}, on an
average day, [will ignite fires covering a surface area of 90 to 152
square miles]{.underline}.

[A war fought with hundreds]{.underline} or thousands [of U.S. and
Russian strategic nuclear weapons would ignite immense nuclear
firestorms covering land surface areas of many thousands or tens of
thousands of square miles]{.underline}. The scientists calculated that
[these fires would produce up to 180 million tons of black carbon soot
and smoke, [which]{.mark} would [form a dense, global]{.mark}
stratospheric [smoke layer]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The smoke would remain
in the stratosphere [for]{.mark} 10 to **[20 years]{.mark}**, and it
would block]{.underline} as much as [70 percent of sunlight]{.underline}
from reaching the surface of the Northern Hemisphere and 35 percent from
the Southern Hemisphere. [So much sunlight would be blocked by the smoke
that the noonday sun would resemble a full moon at
midnight]{.underline}.

[Under such conditions, [it would only require a **matter of
days**]{.mark} or weeks for daily minimum temperatures [to]{.mark} fall
below freezing in the largest agricultural areas of the Northern
Hemisphere]{.underline}, where freezing temperatures would occur every
day for a period of between one to more than two years. [Average surface
temperatures would [become colder than]{.mark} those experienced 18,000
years ago at the height of [the]{.mark} last [Ice Age]{.mark}, and the
prolonged cold would cause average rainfall to decrease by up to
90%]{.underline}. [[Growing seasons would be **completely
eliminated**]{.mark} for more than a decade; it would be too cold and
dark to grow food crops, [which would **doom the majority of
the**]{.mark} **human [population]{.mark}**]{.underline}.2

[Humanity is facing its **greatest test**]{.underline} [in the
million-year ascent of our kind.]{.underline} This [isn't a]{.underline}
**[single]{.underline}** [challenge]{.underline}. It's [a]{.underline}
**[constellation]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} **[huge man-made
threats]{.underline}**, now coming together [to]{.underline}
**[overshadow]{.underline}** our civilisation's stability and even,
maybe, its **[future survival]{.underline}**. These ten intersecting
risks are: ecological collapse, resource depletion, weapons of mass
destruction, climate change, global poisoning, food insecurity,
population and urban failure, pandemic disease and uncontrolled new
technologies (like killer robots, artificial intelligence and universal
surveillance) -- reinforced by a prodigious capacity for human
self-delusion. But sticking our heads in the sand and trying to ignore
them will not remove the danger.

These threats are known as **['[existential
risks']{.mark}]{.underline}** because they [[imperil]{.mark}
our]{.underline} **[future [existence]{.mark}]{.underline}**, both as
individuals, as a civilisation and maybe even [[as a]{.underline}
**[species]{.underline}**]{.mark}.

Their most important feature is the fact that [they are]{.underline}
**[not isolated]{.underline}** from one another. [They are]{.underline}
[**deeply interwoven**. They]{.underline} **[play into]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} [**feed one another**. They]{.underline} **[cannot be
addressed separately]{.underline}** or singly, because to do so creates
a situation where curbing one risk only makes other risks worse.
Together they constitute [a]{.underline} **[single existential
emergency]{.underline}** [facing]{.underline} **[all of
humanity]{.underline}**.

An example of why they cannot be addressed piecemeal is trying to solve
the global food problem by intensifying agriculture worldwide using
fossil fuels, fertilisers and petrochemicals: this will only destroy the
very climate, resources and ecosystem services on which agriculture,
itself, depends -- and is not, consequently, a viable or enduring
solution. Other answers must be sought. Another example is that trying
to end the Sixth Extinction of wildlife on our planet by turning half of
it back to forest and grassland will not work on its own, because it
would involve the sacrifice of half the current human food supply:
consequently, we need a solution that achieves both aims -- sustainable
food for all and a sufficient haven for the Earth's other species. So,
the problem of extinction needs to be solved, in part, by solving the
problem of food -- and that, in turn, entails solving the problems of
climate, global poisoning, resource depletion and other mega-risks. It
is absolutely clear from this that the solutions we adopt must be
cross-cutting. They must comprehensively address all the perils we face,
not just one or a handful of them.

Take these ten great risks together and what you have is the focal issue
of our time -- the greatest and most profound challenge ever to confront
human civilisation. The risks are all selfinflicted, a direct result of
the overgrowth in human numbers and our unbridled demands on the planet
-- for food, resources, space and a healthy environment. By solving them
together, we ensure our future. By denying them or failing to solve them
all in time, we knowingly create untold misery and suffering for most of
humanity and generations to come through the centuries ahead. We are
gambling with the very survival of our civilisation and species. The
risks are described below, along with observations about how they play
into the Food or War scenario. The detail, the scientific sources and
the solutions, collective and individual, to each risk are described in
more detail in Surviving the 21st Century.

Extinction and Ecological Collapse

More than half of the large animals that once inhabited the Earth have
been wiped from it by human action since 1970, according to the
Worldwide Fund for Nature's Living Planet Index.3 So, too, have half the
fish in the sea on which humans rely for food.4 Humans are, in the words
of the great biologist E. O. Wilson, 'tearing down the biosphere',
demolishing the very home that keeps us alive.5

Extinction, it should be noted, is a part of life: 99.9 per cent of all
species ever to evolve on this planet have disappeared, and new ones
like ourselves have arisen to replace them. But extinction rates like
today's -- a hundred to a thousand times faster than normal -- are a
freak occurrence that usually takes tens of millions of years, not mere
decades. Animal, plant and marine species are presently vanishing so
fast that scientists have dubbed our time "the Sixth Extinction" -- the
sixth such megadeath in the geological history of the Earth.6 By the end
of the present century, Wilson says, it is possible that up to half of
the eight million species thought to exist here will be gone.
Furthermore, in all previous extinctions, natural events like asteroid
strikes and vast volcanic outbursts have been to blame. This will be the
only time in the Earth's history when the wipe-out was caused by a
single species. Us.7

The probability of humans becoming extinct during the twentyfirst
century is not high -- but there are scenarios, such as an all-out
nuclear war, runaway climate change (+5--10 C or more), or a compound
collapse in the Earth's main life support systems, in which it must be
regarded as a possibility -- and the fact that it is unpleasant to
contemplate is no excuse for doing nothing to stop it.

However, there are also a number of credible scenarios in which
large-scale ecosystem collapse could endanger civilisation and cause
very high mortality among the world's population. These revolve around
the notion of 'environmental security' which is, in turn, very closely
tied to human security -- i.e. peace or war. An ecosystem is a
biological community of mutually dependent species -- and the removal of
one species after another can undermine it and render it dysfunctional,
in the same way that pulling one brick at a time out of your home will
eventually cause it to fall down. Ecosystems support all life on the
planet, and maintain the quality of air, water and soil on which it
depends. For humans, they provide food and clean water (provisioning
services), disease and climate regulation (regulatory services),
spiritual and aesthetic fulfilment (cultural services), useful chemical
energy (from plants) and soil formation (support services). As
ecosystems decay, the decline and loss of these services often causes
significant harm to human wellbeing and can inflame the tensions that
lead to conflict.

The most destructive object on the planet, as we noted in Chapter 3, is
the human jawbone. The need to keep it fed is responsible, every year,
for the loss of up to 75 billion tonnes of topsoil, the wasting of six
trillion tonnes of water, the release of five million tonnes of
pesticides, and 30 per cent of the world's climate-wrecking carbon
emissions. In addition, the contemporary food system is the chief driver
of deforestation, desertification, wildlife extinctions and impaired
ecosystems. Among the most striking examples of food's impact on the
wild world are the 400+ 'dead zones' spreading through the world's
oceans from the Arabian Sea, to the Baltic and the Mississippi delta.
These are oxygenless layers in the sea, where fish cannot survive. They
are caused by topsoil dislodged by land clearing, over-farming and
over-grazing, the use of huge quantities of artificial fertilisers,
toxic chemicals and human sewage. Along with overfishing they contribute
to an ongoing collapse in world wild fisheries and are a clear example
of how the activity of one part of the food system can impair another.
Similarly, most inland rivers and lakes in populated regions are
eutrophic and polluted -- and no longer capable of producing as much
food as in the past. The loss of wild fisheries increases tensions
between nations and fishers over what remains and can lead to 'fish
wars'. 8

The existing global food production system is therefore a major
contributor to the decline and failure of ecosystem services needed to
support the human population. This in turn rebounds on the food system
itself. Furthermore, the extinction of wild animals and plants deprives
the food industry of many edible species that may be needed as part of a
healthy, diverse global diet in future.

The solution to the extinction crisis is to cease farming and grazing on
about half the currently farmed area of the planet (25 million square
kilometres), transfer food production to the cities where it can take
advantage of all the nutrients and water currently being wasted, and
employ many of the world's farmers and indigenous people as Stewards of
the Earth to manage the rewilding and regeneration of former farmlands.
Food production can continue on the remaining 24 million square
kilometres using eco-agriculture. This process is further described in
Surviving the 21st Century and in Chapter 9 of this book.

How the existing food system plays into the risk of war can also be
viewed through the lens of environmental security: war damages
environments, making it harder for humans to sustain and feed themselves
-- and ruined environments themselves become cauldrons of war. This is
plainly to be seen in the cases of Syria, South Sudan, Yemen and the
Horn of Africa. What we most need are food systems that do not cause
knock-on damage to either the environment and wildlife, the climate, the
oceans or to consumer health -- and which ease tensions, so promoting
peace, not conflict. These are described in Chapters 8 and 9.

Resource Scarcity

The average citizen of planet Earth today uses at least ten times the
volume of resources used by their grandparents a century ago. Since the
human population has also quadrupled over the same time, this means
humanity's gargantuan appetite for minerals, metals, timber, water, food
and energy has grown fortyfold in barely a hundred years. As the Global
Footprint Network explains, we are presently using enough 'stuff' for
1.6 Earths, not just the one we have. We now outrun the Earth's natural
ability to supply our needs in August each year.9 As with the mining of
groundwater, the decline and collapse of global resources like soil,
water and phosphorus, is often imperceptible to the individual: people
have simply no idea they are living on borrowed time and, with that,
comes enormous risk.

To make the issue of resource consumption a little more personal: you
(as an average individual citizen of the planet) will in your lifetime

> -- use 99,720 tonnes (i.e. 40 Olympic pools) of fresh water
>
> -- displace 750 tonnes of topsoil
>
> -- consume 720 tonnes of metals and materials
>
> -- use 80 billion joules of energy
>
> -- release 288 tonnes of CO2
>
> -- release 320 kilograms of toxic chemicals
>
> -- waste 13.4 tonnes of food
>
> -- destroy 800 square metres of forest.

Because of the long, cryptic, industrial and international trade chains
which hide it, most of us are unaware of the vast damage we do to the
planet through our simple habit of shopping.

Yes, some of us have a notion that some of our purchases may be bad for
gorillas in the Congo, orangutans in Borneo or flamingos in the Atacama
-- but we mostly have no true appreciation of the wider havoc we inflict
on the Earth and its natural systems by the 'innocent' act of
consumption, which business and governments try constantly to convince
us is essential to 'growth and jobs'.

It should therefore come as no surprise that the world finds itself
increasingly short of key resources like fresh water, soil, phosphorus,
timber and certain minerals -- and that these shortages are giving rise
to tensions and even to conflicts. Indeed, resource scarcity has for
some time been considered by strategic experts to be one of the most
likely causes of war in the twentyfirst century.10

However, people are not equally responsible for the devastation of
Planet Earth. The diagram below (Figure 6.1), from \[\[FIGURE 6.1
OMITTED\]\] Oxfam, illustrates how just one tenth of humanity consumes
five times as much in the way of material resources (expressed here in
the form of their carbon footprint) as the poorest half of the world
population. The affluent are chiefly responsible for the destruction
taking place on a global scale as they seek to sustain lifestyles that
the planet can no longer afford or support.

The significance of this blind spot around consumption for global food
security is very great. As described in earlier chapters, the world food
system depends critically on soil, water, nutrients and a stable
climate, to supply humanity's daily need for nutriment -- and all of
these essential resources are in increasingly short supply, chiefly
because of our own mismanagement of them and our collective failure to
appreciate that they are finite. On current trends, the existing food
system will tend to break down, first regionally and then globally,
owing to resource scarcity from the 2020s onward, and especially towards
the mid century -- unless there is radical change in the world diet and
the means by which we feed ourselves. This will lead to increasing
outbreaks of violence and war. Nobody, neither rich nor poor, will
escape the consequences.

Weapons of Mass Destruction

[Detonating just]{.underline} **[[50]{.underline}]{.mark}**--100 out of
the global arsenal of nearly 15,000 **[nuclear
[weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}** [would]{.underline} [**suffice to [end
civilisation]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} a [**nuclear winter**,
causing]{.mark}]{.underline} **[worldwide [famine]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[economic collapse]{.underline}** [affecting
even]{.underline} **[distant]{.underline}** [nations]{.underline}, as we
saw in the previous chapter in the section dealing with South Asia.
**[Eight nations]{.underline}** now [have the power to]{.underline}
**[terminate civilisation]{.underline}** should they desire to do so --
[and]{.underline} **[two]{.underline}** [have the power to]{.underline}
**[[extinguish the]{.mark} human [species]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
According to the nuclear monitoring group Ploughshares, this arsenal is
distributed as follows:

> -- Russia, 6600 warheads (2500 classified as 'retired')
>
> -- America, 6450 warheads (2550 classified as 'retired')
>
> -- France, 300 warheads
>
> -- China, 270 warheads
>
> -- UK, 215 warheads
>
> -- Pakistan, 130 warheads
>
> -- India, 120 warheads
>
> -- Israel, 80 warheads
>
> -- North Korea, 15--20 warheads.11

Although actual numbers of warheads have continued to fall from its peak
of 70,000 weapons in the mid 1980s, scientists argue [the]{.underline}
**[danger]{.underline}** [of nuclear conflict in fact]{.underline}
**[increased]{.underline}** [in the first two decades of the
twenty-first century]{.underline}. This was [due to]{.underline} the
**[modernisation]{.underline}** of existing stockpiles, the adoption of
dangerous [new]{.underline} **[tech]{.underline}**nologies [such as
robot delivery systems, hypersonic missiles,]{.underline}
**[a]{.underline}**rtificial **[i]{.underline}**ntelligence
[and]{.underline} **[e]{.underline}**lectronic
**[w]{.underline}**arfare, [and]{.underline} the [continuing
**leakage**]{.underline} [of nuclear]{.underline}
**[materials]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[knowhow]{.underline}**
to nonnuclear nations and potential terrorist organisations.

In early 2018 the hands of the 'Doomsday Clock', maintained by the
Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, were re-set at two minutes to
midnight, the highest risk to humanity that it has ever shown since the
clock was introduced in 1953. This was due not only to the state of the
world's nuclear arsenal, but also to irresponsible language by world
leaders, the growing use of social media to destabilise rival regimes,
and to the rising threat of uncontrolled climate change (see below).12

In an historic moment on 17 July 2017, 122 nations voted in the UN for
the first time ever in favour of a treaty banning all nuclear weapons.
This called for comprehensive prohibition of "a full range of
nuclear-weapon-related activities, such as undertaking to develop, test,
produce, manufacture, acquire, possess or stockpile nuclear weapons or
other nuclear explosive devices, as well as the use or threat of use of
these weapons."13 However, 71 other countries -- including all the
nuclear states -- either opposed the ban, abstained or declined to vote.
The Treaty vote was nonetheless interpreted by some as a promising first
step towards abolishing the nuclear nightmare that hangs over the entire
human species.

In contrast, 192 countries had signed up to the Chemical Weapons
Convention to ban the use of chemical weapons, and 180 to the Biological
Weapons Convention. As of 2018, 96 per cent of previous world stocks of
chemical weapons had been destroyed -- but their continued use in the
Syrian conflict and in alleged assassination attempts by Russia
indicated the world remains at risk.14

As things stand, the only entities that can afford to own nuclear
weapons are nations -- and [**if humanity is to be wiped out**,
it]{.underline} [will]{.underline} **[most likely]{.underline}** [be as
a **result of an atomic conflict**]{.underline} between nations. It
follows from this that, if the world is to be made safe from such a fate
it will need to get rid of nations as a structure of human
self-organisation and replace them with wiser, less aggressive forms of
self-governance. After all, the nation state really only began in the
early nineteenth century and is by no means a permanent feature of
self-governance, any more than monarchies, feudal systems or priest
states. Although many people still tend to assume it is. Between them,
nations have butchered more than 200 million people in the past 150
years and it is increasingly clear the world would be a far safer, more
peaceable place without either nations or nationalism. The question is
what to replace them with.

Although there may at first glance appear to be no close linkage between
weapons of mass destruction and food, in the twentyfirst century with
world resources of food, land and water under growing stress, nothing
can be ruled out. Indeed, chemical weapons have frequently been deployed
in the Syrian civil war, which had drought, agricultural failure and
hunger among its early drivers. And nuclear conflict remains a distinct
possibility in South Asia and the Middle East, especially, as these
regions are already stressed in terms of food, land and water, and their
nuclear firepower or access to nuclear materials is multiplying.

It remains an open question whether panicking regimes in Russia, the USA
or even France would be ruthless enough to deploy atomic weapons in an
attempt to quell invasion by tens of millions of desperate refugees,
fleeing famine and climate chaos in their own homelands -- but the
possibility ought not to be ignored.

That nuclear war is at least a possible outcome of food and climate
crises was first flagged in the report The Age of Consequences by Kurt
Campbell and the US-based Centre for Strategic and International
Studies, which stated 'it is clear that even nuclear war cannot be
excluded as a political consequence of global warming'. 15 Food
insecurity is therefore a driver in the preconditions for the use of
nuclear weapons, whether limited or unlimited.

[[A **global famine** is]{.mark} a **[likely]{.mark} outcome** [of
**limited use**]{.mark} of]{.underline} **[nuc]{.underline}**lear
weapon**[s]{.underline}** [by]{.underline} **[any country]{.underline}**
or countries -- [and would be]{.underline} **[unavoidable]{.underline}**
[in the event of an]{.underline} **[unlimited nuclear war]{.underline}**
[between]{.underline} [**America and Russia**, making it]{.underline}
**[unwinnable]{.underline}** for either. And [**that**, as
the]{.underline} mute [hands of the 'Doomsday Clock' so eloquently
admonish, is]{.underline} also [the]{.underline} [**[most likely
scenario]{.underline}** [for]{.underline}]{.mark} [the]{.underline}
**[[premature termination of the]{.mark} human
[species]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

Such a grim scenario can be alleviated by two measures: the voluntary
banning by the whole of humanity of nuclear weapons, their technology,
materials and stocks -- and by a global effort to secure food against
future insecurity by diverting the funds now wasted on nuclear armaments
into building the sustainable food and water systems of the future (see
Chapters 8 and 9).

Climate Change

The effects of food and war on climate change as it is presently
predicted to occur were described in Chapter 3: in brief, the stable
climate in which agriculture arose over the past 6000 years is now
becoming increasingly unstable as a result of the billions of tonnes of
carbon that humans are injecting into the atmosphere and oceans, forming
a colossal heat engine to drive more frequent, violent weather. This in
turn impairs food production in regions of the world already facing
severe stresses from population growth and resource depletion. Military
analysts describe climate change as a 'threat multiplier', augmenting
the tensions, conflict and instability which already exist. In reality
it is a feedback loop, in which worsening climate conditions cause
greater food insecurity, which is met by measures (like increased land
clearing and use of fossil fuels and chemicals), which in turn worsen
climate conditions, which worsen food security, which cause wars, which
inflict more eco-damage\...

Two degrees (2 C) of global warming -- described as the danger point for
humanity -- are predicted to occur well before 2050 because of our
collective failure to curb our carbon emissions.16 Those 2 C of warming
portend bad things for any food system that depends on the weather --
but just how bad cannot easily be forecast as both the climate state and
the response of the global food system are governed by human behaviour,
which is fairly unpredictable. Current estimates suggest crop losses of
the order of 20--50 per cent at the very time we are trying to raise
food output by 50--70 per cent. What can be confidently predicted,
however, is that there will be an increase in both the frequency and
scale of harvest failures and agricultural disease outbreaks around the
world as we approach the mid century -- and that beyond 2 C of warming
it will become very hard indeed to maintain a stable outdoors,
agriculture-based system to meet an anticipated doubling in world demand
for food by the 2060s. The 'worst case' risk of this, as previously
outlined, would be ten billion people having to subsist on enough food
to feed only four billion.

That, however, is by no means the worst case of the climate story. There
are ominous signs that humans have already unleashed planetary forces
over which we have absolutely no control -- and that these, should they
become large enough, will take charge of the Earth's climate engine and
drive it into a superheated condition of +9--10 C or even higher.

Today, more people are aware that global warming may lead to complete
melting of all glaciers and the polar ice-caps, thereby raising sea
levels by 65 metres and inundating almost all of the world's seaboard
cities, fertile river deltas and coastal plains.17 This would clearly
have a devastating effect on coastal food production. However, this
process will probably take several centuries, allowing populations ample
time to relocate inland. That sea levels previously rose by a similar
quantum at the end of the last Ice Age, flooding part of Australia,
severing Britain from Europe and America from Asia, is proof enough that
such events occur as a regular part of the Earth's warming and chilling
cycles.

The great existential threat to humanity lies in vast stores of frozen
methane gas (CH4) locked into the soils of the tundra regions of Canada
and Siberia, in colossal deposits of frozen methane on the continental
seabed surrounding the Arctic Ocean, and in massive stores of methane
submerged in peat deposits and swamps in places such as the Amazon and
the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia and Africa. Methane is a gas
with 20--70 times the climate-forcing power of carbon dioxide. These
deposits are the accumulation of the slow decomposition of planet and
animal matter in the Earth's sediments over several hundred million
years -- they are identical in origin to the gas bubbles that surface
when we stir the bed of a pond or lake.

The actual volume of these methane deposits is still being assessed by
science. Recent estimates suggest:

> • seabed deposits -- between 500--2500 billion tonnes of frozen
> carbon;18
>
> • tundra deposits -- potentially emitting 180--420 million tonnes of
> carbon a year by 2100; and
>
> • tropical peat swamps -- could emit 480--870 million tonnes of carbon
> a year by 2100.19

That carbon released from peat swamps, tundra and possibly the oceans
can have a catastrophic effect on the Earth's climate is foreshadowed by
an event known as the Palaeocene--Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), which
took place some 55 million years ago, when Earth took a sudden fever and
its temperature rocketed upwards by +5--9 C. This 'heat spike' caused a
lesser extinction event involving widespread loss of ocean life and a
smaller toll of land animals.20 However, the heating occurred over a
much longer period -- 100--200,000 years, compared with human-driven
heating (50--100 years) -- and is thought to have been mainly caused by
the drying out and burning of tropical peat swamps as the climate
warmed. However, the volume of carbon which caused this sharp planetary
heat spike in the past is estimated to be barely a tenth of that
released by humanity today.21

Today, human activity in clearing rainforests, draining swamps and
burning the world's forests to open them up for farming and food
production is releasing vast amounts of methane and CO2. Explosion
craters have been reported across Canada and Siberia as frozen methane
deposits well up and erupt with the melting of the tundra. And
scientists from Sweden, Russia, Canada and America have reported methane
bubbling from the seabed of the Arctic Ocean, though not yet in massive
volumes. The risk in all this is that, by warming the planet by only
1--2 C, we have set in train natural processes that we are powerless to
control, setting ourselves on an inescapable trajectory to a Hothouse
Earth, 5--10 C or more above today's levels.

Although it is hard to estimate, some scientists are of the view that
fewer than one billion humans would survive such an event22 -- in other
words, nine people out of every ten may perish in the cycle of famines,
wars, heatwaves and pandemic diseases which global overheating would
entail. This underlies the deadly urgency of ceasing to burn all fossil
fuels, locking up as much carbon as possible and re-stabilising the
Earth's climate. In that, food production can and will play a central
role.

This is a summation of the chemical crisis facing all of humanity, as
well as all life on Earth, which I wrote in Surviving the 21st Century,
and which is based on the extensive scientific research reported in
Poisoned Planet.23 It is a crisis with profound impact for everyone.

According to the medical journal The Lancet, nine million people -- one
in six -- die every year from chemical pollution of their air, water,
food and living environment.24 A further 40 million die from the
so-called noncommunicable or 'lifestyle' diseases (NCDs), cancer, heart
disease, diabetes and lung disease, which are mostly diet-related.25

Food production, as we have seen, is deeply implicated in the chemical
deluge. However, it is also an existential threat to human health, both
in terms of infectious disease and the new 'lifestyle' diseases. No-one
to my knowledge has compiled an accurate assessment of the total
chemical effusion of humanity or presented a realistic impression of its
true scale. Box 6.1 represents my own best estimate, drawn from various
reliable sources.

From this it can easily be seen that the scale of humanity's chemical
assault on ourselves and on the planet is many times the scale of our
climate assault -- yet this issue commands nowhere near the political or
scientific priority that it should. It is arguably the most under-rated,
under-investigated and poorly understood of all the existential threats
to humanity.

The poisoning of the Earth by human activities has grave implications
for the health and safety of the global food chain and its eight billion
consumers. It is not only the use of chemicals in food production that
is of concern, but also the contamination of water, soils and livestock
by industrial pollutants from other sources, such as mining or
manufacturing. It is also the disruption of vital services such as
pollination by insects of a \[\[BOX 6.1 OMITTED\]\] third of the world's
food crops and 90 per cent of wild plants.26 It is the contamination of
up to three quarters of the world fish catch with microscopic plastic
particles and clothing microfibres made by the petrochemical industry.27

The ending of this flood of poisons is a prerequisite for a safe,
healthy and sustainable global food supply in future. And, since
government regulation has largely failed to stem the worldwide flood,
the task now falls to consumers -- to choose foods which have been
produced by safe methods and shun foods produced by unsafe methods. That
is the only way that the food industry can be encouraged (and penalised)
into doing the right thing by humanity and the planet: by consumers
rewarding it for producing clean food and punishing it for toxic food.
Otherwise it will continue to pollute as profitably as it can. It
follows that the urgent global education of consumers about which foods
are safe and which are toxic is also a pre-requisite.

Food Security

Our demand for food is set to double by the 2060s -- potentially the
decade of 'peak people', the moment in history when the irresistible
human population surge may top out at around 10 billion. However, as we
have seen, many of the resources needed to supply it agriculturally
could halve and the climate for the growing of food outdoors become far
more hostile.

Why [**[food insecurity]{.underline}** [is]{.underline}]{.mark} [an
**[existential]{.mark} threat to humanity**]{.underline} should, by now,
be abundantly clear from the earlier chapters of this book: [present
systems are **unsustainable**]{.underline} [and, as they **fail**,
will]{.underline} [pose risks **both to civilization**]{.underline}
[and, should these **spiral into nuclear conflict**, to the **future of
the human species.**]{.underline}

The important thing to note in this chapter is that [food insecurity
plays into **many, if not all, of the other existential
threats**]{.underline} [facing humanity. The food sector's role in
**extinction**]{.underline}, **[resource scarcity]{.underline}**,
[global]{.underline} **[toxicity]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
potential **[nuclear war]{.underline}** [has]{.underline}
**[already]{.underline}** [been explained]{.underline}. [Its role in the
**suppression of conflict**]{.underline} is discussed in the next
chapter. [Its role in **securing the future of the
megacities**]{.underline}, [and of a largely **urbanised
humanity**]{.underline}, is covered in Chapter 8. And its role in
**[sustaining]{.underline}** [humanity through the **peak in
population**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[into a sustainable world
beyond]{.underline}** is covered in Chapter 9.

Food **[clearly]{.underline}** has a **[pivotal]{.underline}** role [in
the future of human population]{.underline} -- both as a driver of
population growth when supplies are abundant and [as a potential driver
of population **decline**, should food chains collapse. It is no
**exaggeration to state that the fate of civilisation depends on
it**]{.underline}.

Pandemic Disease

**[Disease [pandemics]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[have been]{.mark} a
well-known **[existential]{.mark}** risk to humanity since the **plague
of Athens**]{.underline} in 430 BC -- itself linked to a war. However, a
point that escapes many people nowadays is that, as [humans have become
**so numerous**]{.underline} -- indeed the predominant lifeform on the
planet -- [we have also become the major food source for many microbes.
We are now the 'living compost heap' on which they must dine and in
which they must reproduce]{.underline}, if they are themselves to
survive.

As our own population grows, [pandemics [are]{.mark} thus **[likely to
increase]{.mark}**]{.underline}, as more and more viruses and bacteria
are forced to take refuge in humans following the depletion or total
extinction of their natural hosts, the wild animals we are
exterminating. This process is greatly assisted by our creation of
megacities, tourism and air travel, schools and child-minding centres,
air-conditioned offices, night clubs, sex with strangers, pet and pest
animals, insects which prosper from climate change or human modification
of the environment (like mosquitoes), ignorance, poor public hygiene,
lack of clean water, and deficient food processing and handling.

So, [while humanity is confronted with an **ever-expanding array of
parasites**]{.underline}, [we are simultaneously doing everything in our
power to **distribute them worldwide in record time**]{.underline} [--
and to **seed new pandemics**. The]{.underline} **[W]{.underline}**orld
**[H]{.underline}**ealth **[O]{.underline}**rganisation [has
identified]{.underline} **[19]{.underline}** major **[infectious
diseases]{.underline}** [with potential to become]{.underline}
**[pandemic]{.underline}**: chikungunya, cholera, Crimean-Congo
haemorrhagic fever, Ebola, Hendra, influenza, Lassa fever, Marburg
virus, meningitis, MERS-CoV, monkeypox, Nipah, plague, Rift Valley
fever, SARS, smallpox, tularaemia, yellow fever and Zika virus
disease.28 While none of these is likely to fulfil the Hollywood horror
movie image of wiping out the human species -- for the simple reason
that viruses are usually smart enough to weaken to a sublethal state
once comfortably ensconced in their new host -- [the]{.underline}
**[apocalyptic horseman]{.underline}** [representing Pestilence and
Death will nevertheless continue to play a **[synergetic]{.mark} role**
[with]{.mark}]{.underline} his companions [**[warfare]{.mark}**,
**famine**]{.underline}, climate change, global poisoning, ecological
collapse, urbanisation [and]{.underline} **[other existential
threats]{.underline}**.

**[Food insecurity]{.underline}** [affects the]{.underline}
**[progression of pandemic diseases]{.underline}**, often in ways that
are not entirely obvious. First, **[new pandemics]{.underline}** of
infectious disease [tend to [originate]{.mark}]{.underline} in
developing regions [[where]{.underline}
**[nutrition]{.underline}**]{.mark}[al **levels [are
poor]{.mark}**]{.underline} or agricultural practices favour the
evolution of novel pathogens such as, for example, the new flu strains
seen every year -- which arise mainly from places where people, pigs and
poultry live side-by-side and shuffle viruses between them -- and also
novel diseases like SARS and MERS. Second, because totally unknown
diseases tend to arise first in places where rainforests are being cut
down for farming and viruses hitherto confined to wild animals and birds
make an enforced transition into humans. Examples of novel human
diseases escaping from the rainforest and tropical savannah in recent
times include HIV/AIDS, Hendra, Nipah, Ebola, Marburg, Lassa and Hanta,
Lujo, Junin, Machupo, Rift Valley, Congo and Zika.29 And thirdly,
because the loss of vital micronutrients from heavily farmed soils and
from food itself predisposes many populations to various deficiency
diseases -- for example, a lack of selenium in the diet has been linked
with increased risk from both HIV/AIDS and bowel cancer.30 A key synergy
is the way **[[hunger]{.mark} and malnourishment]{.underline}**
**[[exacerbate]{.underline}]{.mark}** [the spread of
[disease]{.mark}]{.underline}, classic examples being [the]{.underline}
**[1918]{.underline}** Global Flu **[Pandemic]{.underline}** which
[spread rapidly among]{.underline} **[war-starved
populations]{.underline}**, or the more recent cholera outbreak in
war-torn Yemen. In a fresh twist, Dr Melinda Beck of North Carolina
University has demonstrated that **[obesity]{.underline}** [-- itself a
form of malnutrition -- may cause increased deaths from influenza by
both aiding the virus and suppressing the patient's immune
response.31]{.underline}

1\. Introduction

Since the proliferation of nuclear weapons in the twentieth century,
considerable attention has been paid to the impact of a nuclear war on
society and the environment. Crutzen and Birks (1982), following
previous ideas by Lewis (1979), suggested that massive forest fires
ignited by nuclear weapons would rage for weeks after a war, producing a
tropospheric pall of smoke that would obscure the Sun and reduce
sunlight at the surface for the duration of the fires. Turco et al.
(1983) conducted the first climate modeling using a radiative‐convective
climate model, showing that a nuclear winter could occur from this
smoke. In a war where nuclear weapons would be used,
**[military]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[industrial
centers]{.underline}** located [in]{.underline} **[urban
areas]{.underline}** [would be targeted, which contain]{.underline}
**[fuel loading]{.underline}** [much]{.underline} **[higher than
forests]{.underline}**, thus [creating an]{.underline} **[enormous
amount of smoke when burned]{.underline}**. Turco et al. (1983) found
that urban fires injecting smoke into the upper troposphere could
produce severe climate changes and that urban firestorms could inject
smoke into the stratosphere, leading to rapid interhemispheric transport
and a long‐lasting smoke pall, which has since been affirmed by coupled
global climate models (Mills et al., 2008; Mills et al., 2014; Pausata
et al., 2016; Robock, Oman, & Stenchikov, 2007; Robock, Oman,
Stenchikov, Toon, et al., 2007). Aleksandrov and Stenchikov (1983)
conducted the first three‐dimensional climate modeling for the injection
scenarios of Turco et al. (1983) showing that continental temperature
reductions would be large despite moderation by the oceans. Malone et
al. (1985) conducted the first three‐dimensional simulations including
smoke transport and removal by precipitation, showing that **[[solar
heating]{.underline}]{.mark}** [could [cause smoke]{.mark} in the
troposphere [to]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[rise]{.mark} into the
stratosphere]{.underline}** **[before]{.underline}** [precipitation
removal, [greatly **prolonging**]{.mark} **the
[lifetime]{.mark}**]{.underline} of the smoke. The effect of this smoke
entering Earth\'s upper atmosphere [would]{.underline} be to [block out
sunlight for]{.underline} months to **[years]{.underline}**, decreasing
temperatures. In 1986, The Scientific Committee on Problems of the
Environment of the International Council of Scientific Unions published
a report describing the immense biological, ecological, and human
impacts of a nuclear war based on the literature at the time (Pittock et
al., 1986). The first simulation with a modern, comprehensive coupled
atmosphere‐ocean climate model by Robock, Oman, and Stenchikov (2007)
showed that solar heating would loft smoke deep into the stratosphere.
Robock, Oman, and Stenchikov (2007) confirmed that a nuclear winter
would result from the amount of soot that could be produced by a nuclear
war between Russia and the United States with current arsenals (Toon et
al., 2008). Later agricultural modeling of a regional nuclear war showed
an increased likelihood of crop failures and global famine due to the
climate effects of smoke (Xia & Robock, 2013; Xia et al., 2015). But
[climate [models]{.mark} have]{.underline} [**[improved since]{.mark}**
20**[07]{.mark}**]{.underline} [in terms of]{.underline} [**horizontal
resolution**, **vertical resolution**, and]{.underline} [**vertical
extent**, which is]{.underline} [**[essential]{.underline}**
[for]{.underline}]{.mark} [an [accurate simulation]{.mark} of smoke
lofting]{.underline}. We employ the much higher resolution WACCM4 model
used by Mills et al. (2014) to repeat the nuclear war scenario from
Robock, Oman, and Stenchikov (2007). We incorporate a more sophisticated
treatment of stratospheric chemistry compared to Goddard Institute for
Space Studies (GISS) ModelE, and aerosol treatment is updated from Mills
et al. (2014) by treating the aerosols as fractal particles whose
optical properties evolve over time. Only Pausata et al. (2016) has used
a model to study the climate effect of nuclear war, using a much smaller
injection than here, that allowed for the growth of aerosols in the
stratosphere, but their model had a limited vertical resolution and
extent (26 levels with a 3‐hPa model top), potentially limiting vertical
lofting. Mixing together varying ratios of organic and black carbon,
Pausata et al. (2016) found a shorter stratospheric residence time of
the aerosols due to particle growth. The use of a model with a higher
model top and higher vertical resolution here should help to more
accurately model the lifetime of fractal smoke particles generated from
mass fires, a key uncertainty in this field of study.

A significant climate response is predicated on the basis that vast
amounts of smoke would reach the stratosphere, and so an accurate
representation of the properties of the aerosols and the amount is
crucial. The aerosols produced following the fires ignited by a nuclear
explosion would contain organic compounds mixed with elemental carbon,
which is also called soot or black carbon. The smoke calculations from
Toon et al. (2007) excluded organic carbon, just as most historical
climate simulations did, so while including it could increase particle
extinction and reduce soot residence time in the stratosphere, as
Pausata et al. (2016) found, we exclude it as well. Black carbon is one
of the most efficient aerosols at absorbing visible light, allowing for
the surrounding air to become buoyant when the aerosols are heated
(Ackerman & Toon, 1981; Bond et al., 2013; Turco et al., 1983). For
example, a stratospheric injection of a few tenths of a teragram of
smoke, containing a few percent of black carbon, from a forest fire in
British Columbia in August of 2017 heated the air by about 7 K by
absorbing sunlight and lofted the smoke from an injection height of
about 12 km to above 20‐km altitude within a few weeks (e.g., Khaykin et
al., 2018; Peterson et al., 2018; Yu et al., 2019). In contrast, 180 Tg
of black carbon (excluding organic compounds that would also be emitted)
might be injected in a full scale nuclear war between the United States
and Russia from convective plumes from fires (Toon et al., 2008).
Self‐lofting would allow the aerosols to rise deep into the
stratosphere, resulting in a long‐duration climate response (Malone et
al., 1985, 1986; Robock, Oman, & Stenchikov, 2007, Robock, Oman,
Stenchikov, Toon, et al., 2007). [[Without]{.mark} precipitation to act
as a]{.underline} [[removal]{.mark} mechanism, aerosols would **remain
in the stratosphere for**]{.underline} months to **[years]{.underline}**
depending on particle size. Robock, Oman, and Stenchikov (2007) used a
model that did not include aerosol particle coagulation and growth and
[[found]{.underline}]{.mark} an e‐folding lifetime of 4.6 years for soot
particles in the stratosphere. However, simulations of massive soot
injections of tens of thousands of teragram of black carbon following
[[the **impact that killed the dinosaurs**]{.underline}]{.mark} showed
that particle coagulation should occur, producing large soot particles
with greater fall speeds (Bardeen et al., 2017; Toon et al., 2016).

Volcanic eruption clouds provide a well‐observed analog for particle
lifetimes and climate effects. Sulfate aerosols generated from gases
injected into the stratosphere by volcanic eruptions cause global
cooling due to the reflection of incoming solar radiation back to space,
which has been observed numerous times and modeled successfully (Robock,
2000). Simulations of volcanic clouds including particle growth show
that large volcanic eruptions, such as that of Mt. Pinatubo with 35 Tg
of sulfate aerosols, produce clouds with lifetimes of about 1 year, as
observed (Barnes & Hoffman, 1997; Deshler, 2008). However, numerical
simulations suggest that larger eruptions, which are not well observed,
will produce large particles with shorter lifetimes (English et al.,
2013; Pinto et al., 1989). Volcanic aerosols are not transported as high
as black carbon aerosols as they are only weakly absorptive and do not
self‐loft significantly (Robock, Oman, & Stenchikov, 2007). Wildfires
pale in comparison to the Mt. Pinatubo cloud mass, but their aerosols
can heat the air enough to be lofted 8 km vertically (Yu et al., 2019).
An injection of 150 Tg of black carbon would be a far greater aerosol
loading than wildfire contributions or any volcanic eruptions from the
past 100 years (when masses can be reliably determined) but would be
orders of magnitude smaller than injections of black carbon into the
atmosphere 66 million years ago when an asteroid impact caused much of
the biomass on Earth\'s surface to burn, resulting in a mass extinction
event (Bardeen et al., 2017; Toon et al., 2016). Volcanic eruptions and
mass fires are both effective methods of injecting aerosols into the
stratosphere, but the black carbon produced by nuclear mass fires, like
what is simulated here, results in far more extreme climate effects per
unit mass.

Cooling at the surface is only one of many phenomena that would occur if
abundant black carbon aerosols are injected into the stratosphere.
Several modeling studies have shown that stratospheric temperatures
would increase by more than 50 K and stratospheric ozone would undergo
global destruction, even for a scenario where 5 Tg of soot is injected
into the stratosphere (Mills et al., 2014; Robock, Oman, Stenchikov,
Toon, et al., 2007; Toon et al., 2007). The global hydrologic cycle
would become far less active, with a reduction in summer monsoon
precipitation and a significantly reduced growing season (Robock, Oman,
& Stenchikov, 2007; Robock, Oman, Stenchikov, Toon, et al., 2007). The
impacts on human society would be devastating due to agricultural losses
alone, even from the 5‐Tg scenario (Xia & Robock, 2013; Xia et al.,
2015). Research on the climate impacts of volcanic eruptions has found
similar, although usually less severe, consequences as a result of
global cooling due to smaller stratospheric aerosol loadings (Robock,
2000).

There are many uncertainties in computing the climate after a nuclear
conflict. The greatest uncertainty is how many weapons would be used,
what yields would be employed, and which targets would be chosen. This
uncertainty cannot be reduced, so ideally, a range of scenarios must be
considered to understand the full spectrum of impacts. Using the
high‐end scenario from Robock, Oman, and Stenchikov (2007), we assume a
war between Russia and the United States, involving numbers of weapons
allowed under current treaties. The area burned, the amount of fuel
available, the amount of smoke and black carbon produced by the fires,
as well as the injection altitudes of the smoke, are also uncertain. We
use the approach of Toon et al. (2007) who estimated that 180 Tg of
black carbon could be emitted into the upper troposphere. Following
Robock, Oman, and Stenchikov (2007), we round this estimate downward to
150 Tg, which would double the 20% of black carbon rain‐out assumed by
Toon et al. (2007) and used by Mills et al. (2008). The soot aerosols
are emitted over the continental areas of the United States and Russia
following the same idealized approach from Robock, Oman, and Stenchikov
(2007). The climate response and smoke removal mechanisms may also
differ between models. To date, only Robock, Oman, and Stenchikov (2007)
have used a modern climate model to simulate this particular scenario of
an all out nuclear war between the United States and Russia. Here we
repeat the nuclear war scenario from Robock, Oman, and Stenchikov (2007)
using an alternative state‐of‐the‐art modern climate model run at higher
resolution and with a more explicit simulation of stratospheric
chemistry and aerosols. We then compare our new results to the GISS
ModelE simulations from Robock, Oman, and Stenchikov (2007) to help
determine how sensitive the climate changes may be to the details of the
model and to further constrain the lifetime of black carbon aerosols
during this type of black carbon injection.

2\. Methods

We use the Community Earth System Model with the Whole Atmosphere
Community Climate Model, version 4 (WACCM4) for its atmospheric
component. The model has a horizontal resolution of 1.9° × 2.5°
(lat‐lon), with 66 vertical layers and a model top of 140 km (Marsh,
Mills, Kinnison, Lamarque, Calvo, et al., 2013; Bardeen et al., 2017).
The Community Land Model 4.0 is used as the land surface model, Parallel
Ocean Program v2 is the ocean model, atmospheric CO2 is set at a
constant 370 ppm (levels during the year 2000, same as GISS ModelE),
tropospheric aerosols (other than black carbon) are prescribed, and
ocean biogeochemistry is included. While full tropospheric chemistry is
not included, the transport and removal of soot from fires is handled by
the Community Aerosol and Radiation Model for Atmospheres (CARMA). CARMA
is a sectional aerosol model, which in this case treats soot as fractal
particles (Bardeen et al., 2008, 2017; Toon et al., 1988; Turco et al.,
1979). As a result, the size of particles is not fixed and can change
depending on the rate of coagulation and sedimentation. CARMA has 21
different size bins each with different optical properties, such that
changing aerosol sizes also changes the amount of extinction and
absorption of radiation. This is the same climate model used by Mills et
al. (2014), but their simulation kept the particle size of the soot
particles fixed at an effective radius of 0.05 μm. Fractal particles
using CARMA have a monomer size of 0.03 μm with a fractal dimension
varying between 1.5 and 3.0. Hygroscopic growth is not included, but
particle coagulation is a function of relative humidity. Despite major
improvements in our ability to simulate the evolution of soot particles
through time in the stratosphere, photochemical processing and
heterogeneous ozone chemistry on the surfaces of the soot aerosols are
not represented. The aerosols themselves do not affect the photolysis
rates of gas phase chemicals, similar to the models used in Mills et al.
(2014) and Pausata et al. (2016). This affects our ability to report on
changes in stratospheric ozone, and inclusion of these processes could
potentially shorten the residence time of soot particles in the
stratosphere.

Robock, Oman, and Stenchikov (2007) reported simulations of a similar
war scenario with the GISS ModelE. GISS ModelE is an Earth system model,
which was run with a spatial resolution of 4° × 5° (lat‐lon), with 23
vertical layers and a model top of 80 km (Schmidt et al., 2006). ModelE
included a module to calculate transport and removal of aerosol
particles (Koch et al., 2006). At the time, ModelE used a bulk
stratospheric aerosol model, without the aerosol microphysics
incorporated in WACCM4, where mass extinction and single‐scattering
albedo were prescribed and sedimentation is a function of particle size.
Soot in ModelE was assigned a constant unimodal radius of 0.1 μm, far
different from the fractal particles in WACCM4. In ModelE it was assumed
that soot could not be removed by rainfall for the first 24 hr, while in
WACCM4 soot could immediately be washed out, such that in Mills et al.
(2014), 28% of soot was removed before it could be lofted into the
stratosphere. Three ModelE ensembles run for 10 years each with no black
carbon burden were used as a climatology to compare with the
perturbation case, which simulated the 10 years following the injection
of soot over the United States and Russia.

As was done in previous model simulations of other nuclear war scenarios
(Mills et al., 2008; Mills et al., 2014; Robock, Oman, Stenchikov, Toon,
et al., 2007; Stenke et al., 2013), soot is represented as pure black
carbon in WACCM4. Extinction per unit mass by soot is computed from the
particle size assuming a fractal shape, and a refractive index of
1.8--0.67i, following the approach of Wolf and Toon (2010) and Bardeen
et al. (2017). Consequently, the average optical properties vary
throughout the simulation as the proportion of black carbon in each bin
changes. The mass extinction coefficient for black carbon (for light
within the 533‐nm centered wavelength band, averaged across all particle
sizes) varies between 9.6 and 9.8 m2 /g in WACCM4. In an attempt to
account for dust and organic carbon, Robock, Oman, and Stenchikov (2007)
reduced the mass extinction coefficient of black carbon to 5.5 m2 /g for
all visible light in their 150‐Tg case. ModelE also assumed a constant
particle size, a constant mass absorption coefficient of 2.0 m2 /g, and
a single‐scattering albedo of 0.64. However, most nuclear war soot
injection estimates and simulations used pure black carbon, assuming
that neither dust nor organic carbon would reduce the soot\'s ability to
absorb radiation, while also neglecting their impact on particle size
(Bond & Bergstrom, 2006; Toon et al., 2007). In contrast to ModelE, we
inject 150 Tg of pure black carbon in WACCM4, where the mass extinction
coefficient for particles with an effective radius of 0.1 μm at
wavelengths of light at 533 nm is approximately 7 m2 /g. Not using the
exact same optical properties of black carbon in WACCM4 as in ModelE
sacrifices some direct comparability between the models, but it follows
more closely the approach of other model simulations of mass fires as a
result of nuclear war. Estimates of smoke emissions by Toon et al.
(2008) and others are only for the soot component of the smoke assuming
that any organics produced would be oxidized rapidly in the
stratosphere. Consideration of composition other than pure black carbon
in the smoke would require increasing the mass of smoke emitted in
addition to changing the optical properties. Additionally, our model is
not yet able to allow the ratio of black and organic carbon in fractal
particles to evolve through time, which would be necessary to account
for organic carbon properly. Toon et al. (2008) estimated that 180 Tg of
black carbon alone could be injected into the atmosphere in the war
scenario used here and in ModelE, where urban areas are targeted using
4,400 total nuclear weapons with 100‐kt yield from the Russian and
United States arsenals (Toon et al., 2008). The United States and Russia
each have close to 4,000 strategic weapons deployed or in storage, and
the average yield is larger than 100 kt according to recent estimates
(Kristensen & Norris, 2018a, 2018b). The approach by Robock, Oman, and
Stenchikov (2007) effectively reduced the total black carbon injected
below 150 Tg, which is no longer consistent with estimates of this war
scenario (Toon et al., 2007). If Robock, Oman, and Stenchikov (2007) had
wanted to consider organic or dust emissions, then the total emissions
should have been increased along with changing the optical properties.
Here we just consider the black carbon injection of 150 Tg, which is
consistent with the emission estimates for this war scenario. We ran
three ensembles of WACCM4 for 20 years each with no black carbon burden
to use as a climatology to compare with a soot injection case.

The black carbon is injected into the upper troposphere (300--150 hPa)
at a rate that is linearly decreasing over a 1‐week period starting on
15 May and is spread uniformly over the same areas of Russia and the
United States as in ModelE. We retain this simplified approach, while in
reality, soot injections would initially be focused only over areas
targeted but over days to weeks would likely spread out similar to our
initial injection. The year of the injection will be referred to as Year
0, which, in agreement with GISS ModelE, is the year 2000. WACCM4 was
run for 20 years following this perturbation, and additional ensemble
member simulations were not conducted because the magnitude of the
forcing is far greater than natural variations on a global scale. Even
for a 5‐Tg soot injection, the signal dominates over natural variability
(Mills et al., 2014). CO2 was kept constant.

3\. Results

3.1. Transport of Soot Across the Globe, Impact on Radiation, and Soot
Fallout

The pattern of smoke emitted during the first week is illustrated in
Figure 1, which shows the mass mixing ratio of soot at 250 hPa in the
WACCM4 simulation. Intense solar heating of the aerosols generates
positive buoyancy over large areas, enabling the aerosols to reach the
upper levels of the stratosphere, encountering winds that quickly
distribute the smoke over the Earth. After a week, soot can be found
throughout most of the Northern Hemisphere (NH), and after 2 weeks it
drifts into the Southern Hemisphere. Once emitted in WACCM4, the smoke
is heated by sunlight and self‐lofts to pressures as low as 0.01 hPa
(altitude = 80 km), as illustrated in Figure 2a, which shows the soot
mass mixing ratio with height averaged over the Earth through time
during the WACCM4 simulation. Because WACCM4 simulates changes in the
size of soot particles, there is significant particle growth through
time, shown in Figure 2b. The particles in WACCM4 grow to more than 10
times the size of the fixed radius of 0.1‐μm particles in GISS ModelE,
which has consequences for soot lifetime and scattering. The presence of
highly absorptive black carbon aerosols in the stratosphere results in
considerably enhanced stratospheric temperatures in both WACCM4 and
ModelE (see Figures 2c and 2d). WACCM4 has more vertical levels and a
higher model top than GISS ModelE, allowing for more accurate handling
of upper level thermodynamic and dynamic processes. Although
stratospheric heating is stronger in WACCM4 due to a higher mass
absorption coefficient, as evidenced by the larger area of 100 K or
greater heating in Figure 2c, it persists for a longer period of time in
GISS ModelE due to longer aerosol residence time, as shown by the
presence of the 30 K or greater anomaly after more than 10 years.

The time evolution of the zonally averaged aerosol optical depth (AOD)
anomaly in both WACCM4 and ModelE is illustrated in Figure 3, where GISS
ModelE output is from Robock, Oman, and Stenchikov (2007). The WACCM4
model produces optical depths in both the Northern and Southern
Hemispheres, which exceed those from ModelE by a factor of up to 2 in
the initial few years. The decision to use pure black carbon in WACCM4
contributes partly to this. The second factor is WACCM4\'s more
sophisticated microphysics scheme, which allows particles to form long
chains and causes a steady increase in particle effective radius (and
scattering) over time. If the mass extinction coefficient in WACCM4 was
reduced by 20% across all wavelengths and particle sizes, so that
aerosols with a 0.1‐μm effective radius had a mass extinction
coefficient of 5.5 m2 /g (like in ModelE), growth still would have
resulted in a mass extinction coefficient just larger than 7.5 m2 /g for
all particles in the 533‐nm band in WACCM4. Therefore, even if the soot
in WACCM4 began with the exact same size and optical properties as
ModelE, the presence of larger fractal‐ shaped aerosols still would have
promoted higher AOD compared to the smaller, unchanging particles
assumed in ModelE. A tipping point is reached after Year 2, when the
particles in WACCM4 grow too large and begin to fall out more quickly.

The time evolution of the total amount of soot in the atmospheric
column, or soot burden, as simulated by WACCM4 and ModelE is illustrated
in Figure 4. Additionally, the soot optical depth in the visible band,
\[\[FIGURE 1 OMITTED\]\] which is calculated at 500 nm in WACCM4, is
shown. The initial injection of soot is followed by a gradual decline
over the course of a decade. A drop off occurs a few months after the
initial injection, but then it levels off during the spring of Year 1.
During the next fall, there is another quick drop in total soot burden
and a leveling off in the subsequent spring. This stair‐step pattern
continues for the first few years, gradually becoming less prominent as
soot is removed at a more constant rate regardless of season after Year
2. Global removal of soot is enhanced during boreal winter in part
because the majority of the soot \[\[FIGURE 2 OMITTED\]\] \[\[FIGURE 3
OMITTED\]\] \[\[FIGURE 4 OMITTED\]\] initially resides in the NH. Soot
removal is enhanced especially near the northern polar region during
this time mostly due to large‐scale descent and reduced heating of
aerosols. As the soot becomes evenly spread with time, the effect is
reduced. Soot is removed more slowly in ModelE compared to WACCM4,
starting with the first winter after the soot injection, and this
continues through to the end of the ModelE simulation, where 19 Tg of
black carbon is left but less than 2 Tg remains in WACCM4 at the same
time.

The mass‐weighted global average mass extinction coefficient of black
carbon in WACCM4 is 9.6 m2 /g for the first month (at a wavelength of
533 nm) and increases to 9.8 m2 /g during the next few months of the
model run, which is its peak value for the simulation. The change in
optical depth in WACCM4 closely tracks the change in soot burden,
consistent with very little change in the mass extinction coefficient
after the first few months. For a wavelength of 533 nm, the mass
absorption coefficient is 5.48 m2 /g. Although the size of the aerosols
change, the mass absorption coefficient remains constant at 5.48 m2 /g
in WACCM4 for particles with an effective radius greater than 0.036 μm
(see Figure S1 in the supporting information). After 1 month, nearly
100% of the black carbon aerosols in WACCM4 grow beyond this size. As a
result, the aerosols are twice as effective at absorbing shortwave
radiation compared to those used in the ModelE experiment. However,
variations in the mass extinction coefficient with time are primarily
due to changes in scattering as opposed to absorption. The mass
extinction coefficient (scattering and absorption combined) as a
function of particle radius for a number of wavelengths of light in
CARMA is shown in Figure 5. The properties of the particles used in
ModelE are also designated in Figure 5. There is a peak in mass
extinction coefficient near 10 m2 /g for aerosols with an effective
radius between 0.3 and 0.56 μm for a wavelength of 533 nm. During the
first few months of the simulation, the majority of black carbon
aerosols in WACCM4 are within this size range. As most of the particles
grow out of this optical sweet spot, they become slightly less
effective. However, even when the particles in WACCM4 are at their
largest sizes, they are still more effective at scattering and absorbing
solar radiation than in the unchanging particles in the ModelE
simulation. The growth of particles that occurs in WACCM4 (see Figure
2b) causes the aerosols to fall out more quickly than in ModelE, as the
largest stratospheric particles preferentially fall into the
troposphere, where they are quickly removed by rainfall and
sedimentation. A fractal particle requires more mass to fall out through
gravitational settling compared to spherical particles, but the aerosols
in WACCM4 quickly surpass a threshold where removal becomes rapid. The
growth of aerosols reduces their lifetime and alleviates the long‐term
climate impact.

The smoke optical properties discussed previously are fed into the
climate model\'s radiation codes. The ModelE and WACCM4 radiative
transfer codes are not identical. WACCM4 uses the Rapid Radiative
Transfer Model for GCMs code (Iacono et al., 2008; Mlawer et al., 1997),
while ModelE\'s radiative transfer code is as described by Schmidt et
al. (2006). Rapid Radiative Transfer Model for GCM uses a two‐stream
scattering model for solar radiation with 14 shortwave bands and 16
longwave bands. Particles are treated as absorbers of longwave
radiation. ModelE has explicit multiple‐scattering calculations for
shortwave and explicit integrations over both the shortwave and longwave
spectral regions. Using a k‐distribution approach, 15 noncontiguous
shortwave and longwave bands are used to model overlapping cloud,
aerosol, and gas absorption (Lacis & Oinas, 1991). Ultimately, we do not
expect the differences between the two schemes to play a primary role in
differences between climate impacts, but we cannot rule out its effect.

There are many similarities in the initial distribution of the AOD
anomaly between WACCM4 and ModelE, shown in Figure 3. Unlike the case of
high‐latitude volcanic eruptions, whose clouds are generally confined to
latitudes poleward of 30° and disappear within less than a year (Robock,
2000), or high‐latitude forest fires injecting smoke just above the
tropopause, which also seem limited to poleward of 30° (Yu et al.,
2019), the emissions from midlatitude urban fires following a nuclear
war spread quickly into the Southern Hemisphere. Enhanced lifetime and
spread (compared to wildfires and high‐ latitude volcanic eruptions)
occur because the self‐lofting of the smoke carries it from the upper
troposphere to very high altitudes where it is in the overworld
stratosphere, unlike volcanic and forest fire clouds that are injected
into the middle world. In the middle world isentropic surfaces connect
the midlatitude stratosphere and upper troposphere in the tropics,
leading to rapid loss of material into the tropical troposphere (Holton
et al., 1995). Once in the stratosphere, soot residence time can also be
lengthened by slowing in the Brewer‐Dobson circulation due to surface
cooling and reduced convection, as was found by Mills et al. (2014).
\[\[FIGURE 5 OMITTED\]\]

The effect of particle growth and faster fallout in WACCM4 can be seen
in Figure 3, where optical depths fall below 0.1 in Year 8 in WACCM4,
while ModelE still has optical depths above 0.2 at Year 10. As particle
effective radius increases in WACCM4, sedimentation is enhanced,
resulting in lower optical depths after 8 years. Based on previous work,
the e‐folding lifetime for stratospheric soot in ModelE was 4.6 years
with an effective radius of 0.1 μm (Robock, Oman, & Stenchikov, 2007).
Soot has a residence time of days to weeks in the troposphere due to
precipitation washing it out, so these times reflect the stratospheric
removal rates (Wang et al., 2014). In the case of simulations of a 5‐Tg
soot injection in ModelE, the mass e‐folding time after initial rain‐out
was longer than for the 150‐Tg case in ModelE. An 8.4 year e‐folding
time was reported for the Mills et al. (2014) experiment where 5 Tg of
soot with a constant radius of 0.1 μm was injected over India and
Pakistan using WACCM4, while 6 years was reported by Robock, Oman, and
Stenchikov (2007) using ModelE. The longer lifetime in the 5‐Tg
experiments of Mills et al. (2014) than in Robock, Oman, and Stenchikov
(2007), both of which fixed the soot radius at 0.1 μm, may have been due
to the higher model top of WACCM4. A higher model top allowed soot to
rise further above the tropopause (Figure 2), and the higher vertical
resolution combined with a more accurate simulation of vertical motion
resulted in the slowdown of the stratospheric residual circulation in
Mills et al. (2008), enhancing soot lifetime. Here, in closer agreement
with the sensitivity test in ModelE, we found using CARMA, which for the
first time allowed the particles to coagulate, an e‐folding lifetime of
3.5 years for the soot from a 150‐Tg injection (as compared to 4.6 years
in GISS ModelE). In the current version of WACCM4 the average effective
radius of soot particles grows rapidly during the first 2 years to a
size greater than 1 μm, reaching a peak of more than 1.3 μm averaged
globally (see Figure 2b).

At the latitudes with the highest optical depths, surface shortwave
radiation reductions of 100 W/m2 continue for 7 years in WACCM4, but for
only 4--5 years in ModelE (Figure 6). Although soot fallout occurs more
quickly in WACCM4, the aerosols are more effective at blocking sunlight
until removal becomes significant, which is around Year 7. Greater
reductions in zonal mean shortwave radiation are observed over the
subtropics and tropical regions in WACCM4 compared to ModelE, and during
summer in each hemisphere, WACCM4 lets in more shortwave radiation at
higher latitudes than ModelE (Figure 6c). This indicates a tendency for
the aerosols to linger in the tropical stratosphere more so in WACCM4
than in ModelE, related to the higher vertical resolution in WACCM4.
Globally averaged, as indicated in Figure 7, both models show reductions
of up to 100 W/m2 during the first year, alongside a dramatic decrease
in temperature and precipitation. The total downwelling solar radiation
at the surface is only 30--40% of normal (where normal is around 160
W/m2 ) during the first 6 months of the soot injection across both
models. \[\[FIGURE 6 OMITTED\]\] \[\[FIGURE 7 OMITTED\]\] In WACCM4,
surface light levels remain below 40% of normal for 3 years, returning
to normal after about 10 years after the war starts, while ModelE shows
a slower recovery, which is a direct consequence of the small, fixed
size aerosols. Low‐light levels during the summer months at high
latitudes may provide a challenge for organisms that depend on
photosynthesis to survive. For example, the base of the photic zone in
the ocean, where photosynthesis largely stops, is taken to be at 1% of
surface light levels. Bardeen et al. (2017) showed that light levels
were well below this limit for the smoke injections that occurred
following the impact of the asteroid at the end of the Cretaceous that
caused a critical mass extinction event. While parts of the polar
latitudes receive less than 5% of normal light during the summer
immediately after the 150‐Tg soot injection, the K‐Pg asteroid
extinction event is clearly a far more extreme case.

3.2. Stratospheric Changes: Temperature, Water Vapor, Circulation

Absorption of solar radiation by soot drives extreme stratospheric
temperature changes, as mentioned previously and shown in Figure 2.
Positive temperature anomalies of more than 100 K occur for about 3
years in the portion of the stratosphere where the bulk of the ozone
layer is located in WACCM4. ModelE has slightly less heating for the
same time and location, a difference that is consistent with the higher
optical depths in WACCM4 as shown in Figure 3 and the higher mass
absorption coefficient. As discussed by Mills et al. (2014) and Bardeen
et al. (2017), increases in temperature of this magnitude result in
dramatic losses of stratospheric ozone, allowing more unfiltered UV
radiation to reach the surface. WACCM4 also observed ozone loss, while
ModelE did not compute changes in ozone. Heating due to soot occurs down
to about 500 hPa, which pushes the tropopause down to very low
altitudes, warming the tropopause. Stratospheric water vapor is
typically limited by the temperature of the tropopause, so water vapor
in the stratosphere increases after the nuclear conflict, as seen in the
global profile of specific humidity and relative humidity anomalies
after the conflict in Figure 8. Variations in water vapor in the WACCM4
control run are shown in Figure S2, along with actual specific humidity
and relative humidity values for the perturbed and control run. Water
vapor intrusions, also found by Mills et al. (2014) and Bardeen et al.
(2017), are significant for ozone chemistry in the stratosphere, as the
photolysis of water vapor exacerbates ozone destruction, which already
is increased due to the stratospheric heating (Mills et al., 2014). As
black carbon aerosols in WACCM4 stick together and their effective
radius grows in size, they become vulnerable to removal from the
stratosphere, which may be exacerbated by the intrusion of water vapor.
While the lower stratosphere experiences an increase in water vapor
(greater than 0.1 g/kg), the local temperature change is so great that
the relative humidity is actually reduced by 10--25% for 7 years after
the soot injection. Around Year 4, water vapor enters the upper
stratosphere (10 to 0.01 hPa) and remains through Year 12. Around Year
9, as the black carbon aerosols are being removed from the lower
stratosphere, the temperature of the stratosphere drops, while the water
vapor content remains relatively constant, causing a 25--50% increase in
relative humidity. A similar phenomenon in the study of the K‐Pg
asteroid impact by Bardeen et al. (2017) led to the rapid removal of
black carbon from the stratosphere, as local regions of the stratosphere
become saturated with water and formed clouds that precipitate the black
carbon. Although an increase in relative humidity is observed here, the
rate of black carbon removal is mostly unchanged during this time (see
Figure 4), similar to what was observed by Mills et al. (2014) in a
study with a smaller soot injection.

Mills et al. (2014) also observed a slowing of the overturning
circulation in the stratosphere, known as the Brewer‐Dobson circulation.
Surface cooling reduced tropical tropospheric updrafts by 50% in a 5‐Tg
nuclear war case, and here, using a very similar model with 150 Tg of
soot, we observed a reduction in vertical velocity of greater than 80%
for up to 4 years. The clear slowing of the overturning circulation of
the stratosphere, the layer where most of the aerosols reside, would act
to lengthen the residence time of aerosols after they are injected.
However, it is apparent that aerosol growth mitigates this effect, as
the aerosols fall out more quickly than in ModelE.

3.3. Surface Temperature Change

In both the GISS ModelE and WACCM4 model simulations, global mean
surface temperatures drop considerably immediately following the soot
injection, as seen in Figure 7. In the first year following the
injection, global temperatures plunge by more than 7 K in both models,
with some subtle differences. A larger negative shortwave radiation
forcing is observed in WACCM4 for 8 years after the injection of soot,
and yet, ModelE is 0.5 K cooler during the first summer and follows the
WACCM4 temperature response very closely for 18 months after the
injection of soot. This indicates that WACCM4 surface temperature is
\[\[FIGURE 8 OMITTED\]\] less sensitive to a given negative shortwave
radiative forcing compared to ModelE. One year after the injection of
soot, global temperatures in WACCM4 have declined by 9.5 K from the
climatological mean, cooler than ModelE by less than 0.2 K. From the
middle of Year 1 through to the beginning of Year 6, WACCM4 remains
colder than ModelE, which is also reflected in global precipitation and
surface radiation. Figure 7 shows that the negative shortwave forcing
reaches its maximum in Year 1, while temperatures continue to decline or
remain low through Year 4. It quickly becomes clear that the temperature
is not simply tracking the available sunlight, as the high thermal
inertia of the oceans delays the minimum global temperature until 2
years after the injection.

Averaged globally, as shown in Figure 7, the WACCM4 simulation is 1 to 2
K colder than ModelE during Years 2 through 5 but by year 6 the WACCM4
and ModelE global temperature anomalies are both −6 K, and WACCM4 is
warming up more rapidly. The speed of global temperature recovery in
WACCM4 is faster than ModelE starting in Year 5. By Year 7, WACCM4 is
warmer than ModelE, despite the stronger negative shortwave radiation
forcing in WACCM4. WACCM4 begins to warm up more quickly, while the
negative shortwave radiative forcing is still greater in WACCM4 compared
to ModelE, but the gap between the two models shrinks for most of the
simulation. When the effect of the larger aerosols falling out in WACCM4
is realized in the surface shortwave radiative anomaly near the end of
Year 8, WACCM4 is already 1.5 K warmer than ModelE and recovering much
more quickly. The quicker return to near zero radiative forcing from
black carbon in WACCM4 is due to previously mentioned differences in
aerosol treatment, but the response in temperature to a deficit in
surface radiation is clearly different between the two models. By Year
10, there is no negative shortwave radiation anomaly in WACCM4. Global
mean surface temperatures remain depressed by 0.5 to 1 K below the
control climatology for up to 15 years after the soot injection due to
the large heat capacity of the oceans and expansion of sea ice across
the NH, which prevents it from rapidly warming back to prewar
temperatures. ModelE was only run for 10 years, but a prolonged
temperature response was also observed in the 5‐Tg case using WACCM4
(Mills et al., 2014).

Bardeen et al. (2017) showed that high stratospheric temperatures,
similar to those observed here, can greatly increase the downwelling
infrared energy at the surface. In our simulation, the globally averaged
budget of downwelling longwave radiation at the surface is
overwhelmingly negative in response to the cooling of the lower
atmosphere. This is contrary to what was found in the K‐Pg asteroid
impact case with very high aerosol loadings and near total darkness
(Bardeen et al., 2017). Significantly more shortwave radiation is able
to reach the surface, while more longwave radiates out to space during
these nuclear war simulations. However, there is a very small increase
in downward longwave radiation at higher latitudes during the winter,
which is related to winter warming in this region.

Global surface temperature anomalies vary in space and in time, but
similar spatial patterns are observed in both models, as shown in the
December‐January‐February (DJF) Year 0--1 and June‐July‐August (JJA)
Year 1 temperature anomalies in Figure 9. Regardless of season, the
largest temperature change is observed over continents. A seasonal bias
in the global mean surface temperature, which is obvious from the
seasonal cycle from Figure 7, is observed due to the larger fraction of
land mass in the NH, which allows larger temperature swings than the
ocean. Negative temperature anomalies are strongest in NH summer (JJA)
and weakest during NH winter (DJF) for the first 4 years. The difference
in the temperature response between DJF and JJA shrinks rapidly in the
ModelE simulation after Year 3 as the oceans are responding to the
forcing and the forcing itself becomes smaller, reducing the amplitude
of the seasonality in the response. Cooling is less significant in the
Southern Ocean in both models (see JJA in Figure 9), because the
Antarctic polar vortex is strengthened, causing a poleward shift in
winds, which reduces the surface westerlies and vertical mixing (Robock,
Oman, Stenchikov, Toon, et al., 2007). The presence of absorbing
aerosols in the stratosphere alters atmospheric dynamics, similar to the
mechanism behind the winter warming response observed in the NH
following large tropical volcanic eruptions (Groisman, 1992; Robock &
Mao, 1992; Stenchikov et al., 2002; Zambri et al., 2017).

Despite such a large aerosol loading, temperatures are warmer than the
long‐term control mean across the Arctic in both model simulations
during the first two winters. While temperatures are warmer, they are
still below freezing on average in the Arctic. Figure 9 shows that parts
of Scandinavia and areas just north of Eurasia are significantly warmer
than normal in both WACCM4 and ModelE during the first full winter
following the soot injection. This warming persists to a smaller degree
during the second winter as well. Compared to ModelE, the WACCM4
simulation is warmer in the Antarctic and Arctic consistently after Year
1 and cooler in much of the tropics through Year 7. The high‐latitude
temperature pattern is indicative of the strongly positive Arctic
Oscillation in the stratosphere (250 to 10 hPa) that propagates down
into the troposphere each winter. As a result, relatively warm air over
the Atlantic Ocean is advected northward. This circulation pattern
occurs for multiple winters, but its temperature signature is obscured
by global cooling after 2 years.

There is a true nuclear winter in both of these simulations, where
temperatures drop below freezing over much of the NH during the height
of summer. Figure 9 shows temperature anomalies for WACCM4 and ModelE
during the second NH summer after the injection (JJA Year 1), one of the
coldest summers after the injection. Continental North America and
Eurasia are 20 K or more below average for up to three summers after the
soot injection. Temperature changes of this magnitude would lead to
below freezing summer temperatures for much of the midlatitudes. The red
line shown in Figure 9 represents locations, poleward of which the
actual temperature is below 0 °C during JJA Year 1, which shows a shift
as far south as northern Texas, Arkansas, and Missouri in the United
States, imperiling important agricultural areas during that summer.

Temperatures below 0 °C in midsummer cause a near 90% reduction in the
growing season in some locations, defined here and in Robock, Oman, and
Stenchikov (2007) as the number of consecutive days with minimum
temperatures above freezing. Figure 10 shows the length of the growing
season (number of consecutive days with minimum nighttime temperatures
above 0 °C) in the control run and for Years 1 to 2 in the 150‐Tg soot
injection run. In the NH, the growing season is measured from 1 January
to 31 December and the Southern Hemisphere is from 1 July to 30 June.
The length of the growing season drops below 50 days across much of the
interior United States and below 100 days for the most agriculturally
productive regions in the U.S. Most of Eastern Europe\'s growing season
is reduced below 50 days, and all parts of Russia have their growing
season reduced below 25 days. Hard freezes, where temperatures drop
below −4 °C, would occur through Years 2 and 3 in the summer, making it
impossible to grow crops in the United States and Russia. Ukraine,
Poland, and Germany would suffer similar fates, while in China, only the
southeast part of the country would stay above freezing during the
summer. WACCM4 produces slightly colder temperatures than ModelE, but
the temperature in both simulations would be perilous for agriculture.

Robock, Oman, and Stenchikov (2007) examined the impacts of a nuclear
winter at a more local level through an analysis of minimum temperatures
in Iowa (42°N, 95°W) and Ukraine (50°N, 30°E) using GISS ModelE, showing
that a 150‐Tg soot injection would produce below freezing temperatures
in Iowa throughout the first 2 years after a full‐scale nuclear war
except for a few days barely above freezing in \[\[FIGURE 9 OMITTED\]\]
midsummer. In Ukraine, GISS ModelE found below freezing temperatures for
two full years, with temperatures barely above freezing in the summer of
the second year. The same analysis is performed here and is shown in
Figure 11 for WACCM4. Temperatures drop below freezing in Iowa within 1
week following the soot injection on 15 May, and daily minimum
temperatures rise above freezing only once in a span of 730 days.
Minimum temperatures only consistently rise above freezing during the
third summer after the initial injection of soot. In Ukraine, the first
summer after the war is not as cold as Iowa, but minimum daily
temperatures frequently drop below freezing. During the next summer,
Ukraine minimum daily temperatures remain close to freezing but still
with days at a time recording below freezing temperatures. This behavior
continues through the third summer after the war, when minimum daily
temperatures rise to the 5 °C range in both Ukraine and Iowa. Clearly, a
nuclear war producing 150 Tg of black carbon would decimate agricultural
output at midlatitudes, as even a smaller regional nuclear war led to a
reduction in Chinese maize and rice production by 15% for 5 years in an
agricultural modeling study (Xia et al., 2015).

3.4. Precipitation Changes

Aerosol‐forced reductions in solar heating, evaporation, and convection
diminish precipitation globally, which is found in both the WACCM4 and
ModelE simulations, as seen in Figure 7 and discussed by Robock, Oman,
and Stenchikov (2007). Figure 7 shows the global precipitation response
in both models over the course of 10 years, where there is agreement in
an immediate, 30% decline in global precipitation through the first few
months of the soot injection. Through Years 2--8 the WACCM4 simulation,
compared to ModelE, has 10% less (−0.3 mm/day) precipitation. The
maximum reduction of globally averaged precipitation in WACCM4 is 58%
and in GISS ModelE is 47%, both during the end of Year 3 and beginning
of Year 4. During Year 7, globally averaged precipitation increases
sharply in the WACCM4 run, while the ModelE simulation recovers very
slowly. The rebound in global precipitation lags the global temperature
rebound by 1--2 years, but this is a similar pattern to aerosol optical
depths between the two models.

Precipitation changes are heterogeneous in space, as some, primarily
arid, regions experience increased precipitation despite the extreme
global reduction. Figure 12 shows JJA precipitation anomalies for both
WACCM4 and ModelE. Averaged globally, WACCM4 has a stronger reduction in
precipitation, but there \[\[FIGURE 10 OMITTED\]\] are far more extremes
in the spatial distribution of precipitation changes. Other than the
reductions in precipitation across much of the continental areas in the
high latitudes due to reduced evaporation, the most obvious change is
the 100% and greater increase in precipitation in the eastern equatorial
Pacific Ocean, especially in WACCM4. This pattern resembles the
precipitation pattern of a moderate to strong El Niño in the WACCM4
control. The Southern Oscillation Index, the normalized pressure
difference between Darwin and Tahiti, undergoes a rapid negative change,
resulting in persistent atmospheric El Niño conditions for more than 7
years after the injection of soot. El Niño conditions are common
following volcanic eruptions, which have been attributed to mechanisms
ranging from land‐sea temperature contrasts to southward Intertropical
Convergence Zone (ITCZ) shifts to eastward propagating Kelvin waves
originating from Africa (Khodri et al., 2017; Pausata et al., 2015;
Stevenson et al., 2016). Despite the rapid global cooling, a warm tongue
is observed in the sea surface temperatures of the eastern equatorial
Pacific from August of Year 0 to February of Year 1. Westerly trade wind
anomalies up to and exceeding 14 m/s develop across much of the Pacific
Ocean for almost a year, which appear to originate over the Maritime
Continent and Southeast Asia. Cold air settles in across the entire
eastern portion of the Asian \[\[FIGURE 11 OMITTED\]\] continent,
causing anomalously high pressure to develop over the continent,
producing an intense Asian winter monsoon pattern across the western
Pacific for many years, regardless of the season. Intense westerly wind
anomalies across the Pacific Ocean result in convection focused over the
eastern equatorial Pacific, as well as moderate warming across the
region. As a result of this change in circulation coupled with a
reduction in evaporation, southern Asia suffers from a collapse of the
summer monsoon in WACCM4, which is present in ModelE as well to a lesser
degree. The weakening of the summer monsoon has been observed following
volcanic eruptions, as continents cool more than the ocean, reducing the
land‐ocean temperature gradient (Iles & Hegerl, 2014; Trenberth & Dai,
2007; Zambri et al., 2017). In the WACCM4 simulation, the summer Asian
monsoon does not return for at least 7 years.

Both WACCM4 and ModelE agree on large precipitation reductions over
southern Asia, across the western coast of central Africa, as well as in
changes to the position of the ITCZ. The ITCZ, a band of clouds located
where the trade winds converge, shifts southward during JJA and
northward during DJF and tends to move toward the warmer hemisphere
(Broccoli et al., 2006; Donohoe et al., 2012). Greater NH cooling during
the summer months leads to a southward shift in the ITCZ. The 6‐month
average position of the ITCZ, which was typically 3--4°N latitude during
the WACCM4 control run, drops as far south as 2.5°S within months of the
soot injection. Less solar heating and convection in tropical areas
leads to a shift in the Hadley cell, weakening the rising branch (see
Figure S3), resulting in a considerable decline in tropical rainfall in
the general region of the equator to 20°N in the JJA season. The
descending branch of the Hadley circulation is also diminished leading
to greater precipitation generally between 20°N and 40°N during JJA, in
subtropical deserts such as the Sahara, and desert regions of Australia,
South America, and South Africa. In addition to temperature being
unsustainable for agriculture, the lack of rainfall in the tropics could
affect agriculture.

A 100% precipitation increase (+1 mm/day) over the Arctic Ocean just
north of Europe during the first full NH winter after the nuclear war in
both model simulations is a result of a dramatic change in the NH
wintertime circulation pattern. As mentioned previously, the net energy
balance is positive over the Arctic in winter due to advection of warm
air from the Atlantic and thermal radiation emitted downward from the
hot stratosphere. Overall, the summer monsoons weaken drastically, the
average ITCZ location annually shifts southward, and precipitation
increases over similar regions in both simulations. Compared to the
ModelE, WACCM4 shows a stronger reduction in the Asian monsoon through
Year 6, followed by faster recovery as the aerosols fall out. \[\[FIGURE
12 OMITTED\]\]

3.5. Changes in Circulation

During boreal winter, when no sunlight reaches the northern pole, soot
in the midlatitudes continues to absorb sunlight, leading to warming in
the midlatitudes and cooling in the polar stratosphere. A differential
heating gradient develops in the stratosphere during NH winter, which
increases the pole‐to‐equator temperature gradient, strengthening the
stratospheric polar vortex (Mao & Robock, 1998; Robock, Oman,
Stenchikov, Toon, et al., 2007; Stenchikov et al., 2002). Zonally
averaged wind speeds at 10 hPa and 60°N reach more than 150 m/s each
winter during the WACCM4 simulation, 250% more than even the greatest
wind speed at this level during the control run. With such strong zonal
winds, the vortex remains intact until the final breakdown occurs during
late spring when sunlight returns to the pole and the temperature
gradient is reversed. WACCM4 and ModelE are in agreement on changes in
atmospheric circulation, but WACCM4\'s higher model top and higher
vertical resolution are more adept at representing stratospheric
variability, making it a better tool to analyze how changes in the
stratosphere result in changes in the troposphere (Charlton‐Perez et
al., 2013; Shaw et al., 2014).

Geopotential heights at 250 hPa for the first six winters after the
injection from WACCM4 in Figure 13a show lower heights in the NH polar
region and higher heights elsewhere, corresponding to a strong zonal
circulation at this level. This height distribution translates into a
highly amplified, positive mode of the Arctic Oscillation (AO) at the
surface. The AO is calculated from the first empirical orthogonal
function of mean sea level pressure from 20°N to 90°N and is normalized
with respect to the WACCM4 control run climatology (Thompson & Wallace,
1998). The pattern from Figure 13a is not dependent on level, as a
\[\[FIGURE 13 OMITTED\]\] positive AO response is present from the
surface up to 10 hPa (see Figure S4). According to Stenchikov et al.
(2002) in a study examining the circulation response to volcanic
aerosols following the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo, a tropospheric pathway
could also contribute to this pattern, where a reduction in upward
propagating planetary waves due to a reduced temperature gradient
between the tropics and midlatitudes allows the stratospheric polar
vortex to become anomalously strong. The heating in the stratosphere for
this scenario is more than 20 times greater than the heating after the
Pinatubo eruption. A potential tropospheric pathway\'s contribution to
the positive AO pattern was not examined in detail here because the
strength of the stratospheric pole‐to‐equator temperature gradient is so
extreme compared to changes in upward propagating planetary waves.
Figure 13b shows the monthly AO index for both the WACCM4 control run
and soot injection run. The AO remains amplified and positive (greater
than 1.0 averaged over DJF) for 12 consecutive winters after the
injection of soot during the WACCM4 simulation. The negative AO present
during summer is due to enhanced heating of the aerosols at the pole.
The NH winter circulation pattern in ModelE also resembles a positive AO
for the 10 years of its run.

The development of a strong stratospheric polar vortex is the main
contributor to warming just north of Eurasia, which only stops when the
oceanic air upstream cools off after 3 years. The most amplified and
positive AO winters in the WACCM4 control run, when averaged together,
produce a temperature signal nearly identical to the observed warming in
the first winter after the nuclear winter. The warming in these nuclear
winter simulations is slightly north of the expected winter warming
following volcanic eruptions and the typical positive AO temperature
pattern (Zambri et al., 2017), as a stronger stratospheric
pole‐to‐equator temperature gradient and stronger polar vortex shifts
the advection of warm air slightly north. At high latitudes during the
winter, an increase in downwelling longwave radiation at the surface is
observed, but the spatial pattern, focused over Northern Europe, is more
consistent with the change in circulation pattern than the distribution
of aerosols. The magnitude of the positive radiative anomaly is within
10% of a composite of all strongly positive winter AO months in the
WACCM4 control run, so any contribution from aerosols is minimal. Thus,
the positive downwelling longwave radiation anomaly arises from a warmer
than normal troposphere, which occurs due to the positive AO circulation
pattern.

4\. Conclusions

**[WACCM4]{.underline}**, a state‐of‐the‐art climate model,
[and]{.underline} **[GISS ModelE]{.underline}**, an older climate model,
were used more than a decade apart to simulate the environmental

[Despite this, the models **agree** that a]{.underline} **[nuclear

United States and Russia, [a result previously found by a large number

Despite]{.underline} **[differences in sensitivity]{.underline}** to

initially, and differences emerge as the aerosols are removed at
different rates. [The new model agrees not just in global averages but
in spatial patterns for temperature, and precipitation changes and other
climate parameters. Both models highlight the risk of a **crash in
global surface temperatures**, but WACCM4 points to a
**[collapse]{.mark} in [the summer monsoon]{.mark}**[,]{.mark}
a]{.underline} [**dramatic [shift]{.mark} in [El Niño]{.mark}
variability**, drastic changes to]{.underline} the **[Northern
Hemisphere winter time circulation]{.underline}**, and a climate state
that is 0.5 to 1 K below climatological temperatures from before the war
with no sign of further warming. The WACCM4 model finds that the
lifetime of the smoke is greatly enhanced over 1980s models, because it
extends to much higher altitudes where the smoke is more isolated from
tropospheric rainfall, a result first found in ModelE by Robock, Oman,
and Stenchikov (2007).

However, compared to GISS ModelE, the lifetime of soot in the WACCM4 run
is shorter due to the inclusion of particle coagulation and fractal
optics, despite the higher vertical resolution and model top,
alleviating the duration of the most extreme climate effects. Despite
this, the cooling for the first few years is more extreme in WACCM4 and
temperatures at the end of the simulation suggest a new colder climate
state. [The inclusion]{.underline} of additional **[particle removal
processes]{.underline}** [addresses a]{.underline} **[long‐standing
uncertainty]{.underline}** [about the black carbon aerosols released
following a nuclear war and allows us to further **constrain their
e‐folding lifetime**]{.underline}. While we did not consider the effect
of organic coatings on top of pure black carbon particles, future work
should incorporate more direct calculations of smoke generation using
high‐resolution fuel loading databases and high‐resolution fire modeling
of urban landscapes to determine the distribution, type, and amount of
material emitted from nuclear fires. Future work will build upon the
results of Yu et al. (2019) to quantify the role of organic carbon in
smoke from pyroCbs and the sensitivity tests of different ratios of
organic carbon and black carbon by Pausata et al. (2016) for a regional
nuclear war. Addressing the uncertainty of aerosol composition would
further quantify the lifetime of these aerosols and their effects on
chemistry in the stratosphere. [The research]{.underline} [conducted
here **supports**]{.underline} the results of Turco et al. (1983), Sagan
(1984), Pittock et al. (1986), Robock, Oman, and Stenchikov (2007),
Mills et al. (2008), Robock and Toon (2012), and Mills et al. (2014)
[that a full‐scale nuclear attack would be]{.underline} **[[suicidal for

the reduction of nuclear arsenals and the eventual disarmament of all
nuclear capable parties are needed.

#### Inbreeding 

**Furlan et. al, 12** (Elise, "Small population size and extremely low
levels of genetic diversity in island populations of the platypus,
Ornithorhynchus anatinus", National Institutes of Health,
<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3399204/)>

[[Genetic diversity]{.mark} generally [underpins population resilience
and persistence]{.mark}. [Reductions in]{.mark} population [size]{.mark}
and absence of gene flow can lead to reductions in genetic diversity,
reproductive fitness, and a [limit]{.mark}ed [ability to adapt to
environmental change increasing the risk of extinction]{.mark}.
[Island]{.mark} [populations are typically small and isolated]{.mark},
and as a result, [inbreeding]{.mark} and reduced genetic diversity
[elevate]{.mark} their extinction [risk]{.mark}.]{.underline} Two island
populations of the platypus, Ornithorhynchus anatinus, exist; a
naturally occurring population on King Island in Bass Strait and a
recently introduced population on Kangaroo Island off the coast of South
Australia. Here we assessed the genetic diversity within these two
island populations and contrasted these patterns with genetic diversity
estimates in areas from which the populations are likely to have been
founded. On Kangaroo Island, we also modeled live capture data to
determine estimates of population size. Levels of genetic diversity in
King Island platypuses are perilously low, with eight of 13
microsatellite loci fixed, likely reflecting their small population size
and prolonged isolation. Estimates of heterozygosity detected by
microsatellites (HE= 0.032) are among the lowest level of genetic
diversity recorded by this method in a naturally outbreeding vertebrate
population. In contrast, estimates of genetic diversity on Kangaroo
Island are somewhat higher. However, estimates of small population size
and the limited founders combined with genetic isolation are likely to
lead to further losses of genetic diversity through time for the
Kangaroo Island platypus population. Implications for the future of
these and similarly isolated or genetically depauperate populations are
discussed. Genetic diversity has been identified as an important factor
influencing a population\'s long-term potential for survival (Bouzat
2010). The contribution of genetic diversity has been recognized in
numerous aspects of population persistence, and is critical for
long-term fitness and adaptation \[see Frankham (2005) for a review\].
[A loss of genetic diversity has been shown to affect individual fitness
with [decreased sperm quality]{.mark} (Hedrick and Fredrickson 2010),
[reduced litter size]{.mark} (Hedrick and Fredrickson 2010), [increased
juvenile mortality]{.mark} (Ralls et al. 1988), and [increased
susceptibility to disease and parasites]{.mark}]{.underline} (Coltman et
al. 1999). Accordingly, populations lacking genetic diversity often
exhibit an increased rate of extinction (Markert et al. 2010).
Inbreeding, genetic drift, restricted gene flow, and small population
size all contribute to a reduction in genetic diversity. [Fragmented and
threatened populations are typically exposed to these conditions, which
is likely to increase their risk of extinction]{.underline} (Saccheri et
al. 1998; Madsen et al. 1999; Frankham et al. 2010). [Island populations
are often isolated and small in size, and therefore experience increased
levels of inbreeding and a greater impact of genetic drift]{.underline}.
As a result, these populations [generally have [lower levels of]{.mark}
genetic diversity and [fitness than counterparts]{.mark} found in
mainland populations.]{.underline} For example, the black-footed
rock-wallabies of Barrow Island, Western Australia, have extremely low
levels of genetic diversity (HE= 0.053), which has led to this
population suffering inbreeding depression: [females experience reduced
fecundity and individuals exhibit increased levels of fluctuating
asymmetry]{.underline} (Eldridge et al. 1999). These [findings are not
atypical with island populations frequently identified as having reduced
genetic diversity, increased levels of inbreeding, and therefore a
**higher extinction risk**]{.underline} (Frankham 1997).

#### Empirics

**Kriege 15** (David Kriege, 3-11-2015, \"Nuclear Weapons and Possible
Human Extinction: The Heroic Marshall Islanders,\" Nuclear Age Peace
Foundation,
<https://www.wagingpeace.org/nuclear-weapons-and-possible-human-extinction/)>

Here is what we know: First, [[nuclear weapons are capable of causing
human extinction]{.underline}]{.mark}, along with the extinction of many
other species. Second, nine countries continue to rely upon these
weapons for their so-called "national security." Third, these nine
countries are continuing to modernize their nuclear arsenals and failing
to fulfill their legal and moral obligations to achieve a Nuclear Zero
world -- one in which human extinction by means of nuclear weapons is
not a possibility because there are no nuclear weapons. Given these
knowable facts, we might ask: What kind of "national security" is it to
rely upon weapons capable of causing human extinction? Or, to put it
another way: How can any nation be secure when nuclear weapons threaten
all humanity? Certainly, it requires massive amounts of denial to remain
apathetic to the extinction dangers posed by nuclear weapons. There
appears to be a kind of mass insanity -- a detachment from reality. Such
detachment seems possible only in societies that have made themselves
subservient to the nuclear "experts" and officials who have become the
high priests of nuclear strategy. Whole societies have developed a
gambler's addiction to living at the edge of the precipice of nuclear
annihilation. Remember Jonathan Schell's insight: "[We prepare for our
extinction in order to assure our survival." Of course, it is
nonsensical to prepare for extinction to assure survival]{.underline}.
Just as to achieve peace, we must prepare for peace, not war, we must be
assuring our survival not by preparing for our extinction, but by
ridding the world of the weapons that make this threat a possibility. We
must, as Albert Einstein warned, change our "modes of thinking" or face
"unparalleled catastrophe."\[iv\] The Victims There have been many
victims of the Nuclear Age, starting with those who died and those who
survived the US atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. This year
marks the 70th anniversary of those bombings. The survivors of those
bombings are growing older and more anxious to see their fervent wish,
the abolition of nuclear weapons, realized. In addition to the victims
in the atomic-bombed cities, [there have been many other victims of
nuclear weapons.]{.underline} These include the people at the nuclear
test sites and those downwind from them. They have [[suffered]{.mark}
cancers, leukemia and other [illnesses]{.mark}. The [effects of the
radiation]{.mark} from the nuclear tests have also [affected subsequent
generations, causing stillbirths]{.mark} and many forms of birth
defects. The [Marshall Islanders were one group of nuclear
victims]{.mark}. They lived on pristine Pacific islands]{.underline},
living simple lives close to the ocean waters that provided their
bounty. [But]{.underline} between 1946 and 1958 the US conducted 67
[[nuclear tests]{.underline}]{.mark} in the Marshall Islands. The tests
[[had the equivalent]{.mark} power [of 1.6 Hiroshima bombs]{.mark} being
exploded daily for 12 years. Some of the [islands]{.mark} and atolls in
the Marshall Islands [became too radioactive to inhabit]{.mark}. The
people of the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI), who became guinea
pigs for the US to study, continue to suffer]{.underline}. They have
never received fair or adequate compensation for their injuries
resulting from the US nuclear testing program.

flavors to stock its five-story shelter. But [most citizens would find
only]{.underline} **[[dank, low-ceilinged
basements]{.underline}]{.mark}** equipped [[with the]{.underline}
**[barest necessities]{.underline}**]{.mark}: bedding, drums of potable
water, medical kits and government-issue wheat crackers. And while Uncle
Sam thoughtfully provided toilet paper, the
**[[toilets]{.underline}]{.mark}** themselves [were]{.underline}
**[[hard]{.underline}]{.mark}**er **[[to come by]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
A handy tip from a government booklet advised: "Make a commode by
cutting the seat out of a chair and placing the pail under it." It's
little wonder that the medical kits also included phenobarbital to chill
everybody out.

Perhaps [**not surprisingly**, the trouble with such crude
accommodations became obvious almost immediately. [Mere **months
in**]{.mark}to the program, reports emerged of]{.underline} **[[leaking
water]{.underline}]{.mark}** drums [and [shelters]{.mark}
that]{.underline} had **[[never received]{.underline}]{.mark}** any
**[[supplies]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In a New York Times story in June
of 1963, a Harlem woman asked, "Who'd want to go down there?" referring
to the fetid tenement cellar meant to serve as her shelter space. The
"rats are as big as dogs," she said. "If fallout came, I'd just run." In
fact, [the]{.underline} **[untenability]{.underline}** [of the shelters
was]{.underline} **[public knowledge before they had even
opened]{.underline}**. A November 1961 story on the front page of The
Washington Post bemoaned that most of the designated shelters would be
little more than "cold, unpleasant cellar space, with bad ventilation
and even worse sanitation."

**[Conditions]{.underline}** [were a serious problem, but]{.underline}
[**location was a bigger one**. **[Two-thirds]{.mark}**]{.underline} [of
the fallout shelters in the U.S. [were]{.mark} in]{.underline} **["risk
areas"]{.underline}**---neighborhoods [[so close to]{.underline}
**[strike targets]{.underline}**]{.mark} that
[[they'd]{.underline}]{.mark} likely **[[never survive an attack]{.mark}
in the first place]{.underline}**. In New York, for example, most of the
government shelters could be found in Manhattan and Brooklyn---despite
the fact that a 20-megaton hydrogen bomb detonated over Midtown would
leave a crater 20 stories deep and drive a firestorm all the way to the
center of Long Island. Even out there, Life magazine said, occupants of
a fallout shelter "might be barbequed."

What were the feds thinking? According to Kenneth D. Rose, author of the
book One Nation Underground, [defense officials placed their faith in
the **[counterforce]{.mark}** doctrine, a game theory that held that
atomic war would be waged with only military installations as targets.
But that was]{.underline} **[wishful thinking]{.underline}**. "It
wouldn't take much for the whole theory to totally go south," Rose said.
"If a bomber missed its target and hit a city by mistake, then of course
the gloves would come off and **[both]{.underline}** sides
[would]{.underline} **[concentrate on cities]{.underline}** as well."

[The shelters' dubious utility **also** hinged on
[the]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[shaky bet]{.underline}**]{.mark} [that the
[Soviets would drop]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[only one
bomb]{.underline}** [on]{.underline}]{.mark} [a city like]{.underline}
[[**New York**, an assumption]{.mark} that]{.underline}
**[[Khrushchev]{.mark} himself]{.underline}** later
**[[ridiculed]{.underline}]{.mark}** in his memoirs. If he'd managed to
get "one or two big ones" into Gotham, wrote the Soviet Premier, ["there
**wouldn't be much of New York left**]{.underline}."

#### 100 isn't enough\-\--survivors still inbreed and can't repopulate

Dark: The World After Nuclear War, 1984 Pg 141-2\]

[Academician Bochkov: **When we talk about the ecological and biological
consequences of a [nuclear war]{.mark}, we are of course focusing on
humankind**. Thus, in thinking about the possibilities of human survival
after a nuclear catastrophe, we should not be afraid to reach the
conclusion that the conditions that would prevail [would not
allow]{.mark} the [survival]{.mark} of human beings as a
species]{.underline}. We should proceed from the assumption that man has
adapted to his environment during a long evolutionary process and has
paid the price of natural selection. [Only over the past few thousand
years has he adapted his environment to his needs and has created, so to
speak, an [artificial environment to provide food, shelter]{.mark}, and
other necessities. [Without this]{.mark}, modem \[[humankind]{.mark}\]
man [cannot survive]{.mark}. Compared to the dramatic improvements made
in the technological environment, **[biological nature has not
changed]{.mark} in the recent past**. ]{.underline}In the statements of
Dr. Ehrlich and Academician Bayev, we have heard about the many
constraints there would be on the possibility of man\'s survival after a
nuclear catastrophe. Because we also have to look at the more long-range
future, I would like to point out that **[[most long-term effects of a
nuclear war will be genetic]{.mark}.]{.underline}** If islands of
humanity---or as Dr. Ehrlich has said, groups of people on islands
somewhere in the ocean---should survive, what will they face in terms of
genetic consequences? If the population drops sharply, the question then
arises of the critical numbers of a population that would be necessary
to ensure its reproduction. [On the one hand [there will be minimum
numbers of human beings]{.mark}; on the other hand, because of the small
numbers, [there will be isolation. **There will**]{.mark} **definitely
[be inbreeding, and lethal mutations]{.mark} will come to the fore as a
result of this**, because of fetal and neonatal exposure to radiation
and because of exposure to fallout. New mutations will arise and genes
and chromosomes will be damaged as a result of the radiation, so there
will be an additional genetic load to bear. **There will be [natural
aberrations and death at birth]{.mark}, so that** the burden of
hereditary illnesses will be only part of a large
load. This undoubtedly [will be **conducive to the elimination of
humanity**]{.mark}**, because [humankind will not be able to
reproduce]{.mark} itself as a species.**]{.underline}

#### Shelters are irrelevant\-\--long-term [environment]{.underline} AND [radiation]{.underline} damage is too strong.

The Environmental Effects of Nuclear War---An Overview." The
Environmental Effects Of Nuclear War, Routledge.

Until recent years the evaluation of [**[nuclear war]{.mark}**fare
[effects]{.mark}]{.underline} has been chiefly in terms of the
**[[direct impacts]{.underline}]{.mark}** [of the
**blast**]{.underline}, **[heat]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} local
**[radioactive [fallout]{.mark}]{.underline}** [as they **destroy
humans**]{.underline}, artifacts [and]{.underline} **[social
structure]{.underline}**. Much of [the public debate over the notions of
a winnable, limited nuclear war and of survival thereafter has focused
on the enormity of demands placed upon **medical
assistance**]{.underline} for those people who live through the initial
blast, the rationale or absurdity of plans to carry out massive
evacuations as a means of deterring or mitigating the consequences of
nuclear attacks, and the complexity of reconstruction.

Now, greater attention is turning toward the environmental consequences
of nuclear detonations. This is basically because of increasing
recognition that [**[regardless]{.underline}** [of]{.underline}]{.mark}
[the [**immediate** impact]{.mark} on lives]{.underline}, health,
buildings, public facilities and the means of production,
[nuclear]{.underline} **[[explosions]{.underline}]{.mark}** might
drastically alter if not, perhaps, [**[fatally impair]{.mark} the [life
support]{.mark} systems [of the globe]{.mark}**. The vision of
[increasing]{.mark} through]{.underline} **[[civil
defense]{.underline}]{.mark}** [the number of survivors from **direct
impacts**]{.underline} [[becomes]{.underline} **[morbidly
whimsical]{.underline}** [if]{.underline}]{.mark} [the [survivors are in
environments no longer capable of providing]{.mark} **essential [water
and food]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

It is now generally believed that [[there is **no**]{.mark} **tenable
concept**]{.underline} [of a **[winnable nuc]{.mark}**lear
**[war]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Most observers agree that [once a nuclear
[exchange]{.mark} is **started**]{.underline} [it [would]{.mark} most
likely **[quickly escalate]{.mark}**]{.underline} [to]{.underline} a
[**\"total\" war**. Whether or not they are **correct** could **only**
be proven by an **initially limited** nuclear exchange]{.underline} that
might or might not trigger a broader, cataclysmic conflict. [It has,
however, become clear that the consequences of a **mass** nuclear
exchange]{.underline}, if it were to occur, [would be **so
catastrophic**]{.underline} [that]{.underline} **[all efforts must be
exercised to prevent it]{.underline}**. What are these consequences?

The following papers review recent efforts towards providing information
on the short and long-term environmental consequences of total nuclear
war. They do not deal with social or economic disruption to normal
functions of society, nor with psychological trauma that may be caused
by the extreme events, nor the breakdown of medical and other emergency
support systems, topics which are nevertheless of profound importance in
consideration of global consequences of such a calamitous event (see,
for instance. Chazov and Vartanian, 1982; Laulan, 1982).

In the case of a widespread nuclear exchange as envisaged by some
analysts, the intermediate and [long-term effects would]{.underline}
**[not]{.underline}** necessarily **[be contained]{.underline}** [within
any specific **geographic area**. In those circumstances the concept of
a battlefield would **no longer be applicable** **even if** it were
possible to limit the exchange to so-called **tactical** weapons. The
use of tactical or counterforce targets would]{.underline}, in the view
of those analysts, **[quickly extend]{.underline}** [to attacks on other
than purely military nuclear installations.]{.underline}

The quality and extent of impairment to widespread life support systems
from various patterns of nuclear explosions have been in controversy.
Some sanguine observers have predicted that populations remote from
direct bomb produced effects of light, heat and explosive blasts, and
adequately protected from short-term fallout, would survive those early
threats to life and health and promptly could set about the task of
reconstructing their damaged physical and social systems. At the other
extreme, observers have asserted that the impacts of a major exchange of
nuclear [warheads would **wound the environment
sufficiently**]{.underline} [to [render the globe **unable to
support**]{.mark} **any substantial [human population]{.mark}
beyond**]{.underline} a period of **[months]{.underline}** or years. In
between, and depending in part on assumptions made as to the number and
nature of the detonations, are a variety of estimates as to the scope of
environmental effects.
