# Framework Core---Wave 1---FMPS

### Notes

The 1NC is modular; you can pick and choose which (if any) cards you
want to read. Along those lines, if you would prefer different 1NC
interpretations, by all means switch them out! I would recommend reading
interpretations which say that the resolutional wording implies action
by the federal government, but any interpretation that the aff in
question doesn't meet works---this is a topicality argument at its core.

### 1NC Core

#### The [text of the resolution]{.underline} calls for debate on hypothetical government action.

**Ericson 3** (Jon M., Dean Emeritus of the College of Liberal Arts --
California Polytechnic U., et al., The Debater's Guide, Third Edition,
p. 4)

The Proposition of Policy: Urging Future Action In policy propositions,
[each topic contains certain key elements]{.underline}, although they
have slightly different functions from comparable elements of
value-oriented propositions[. 1. An agent doing the acting \-\--"The
United States" in "The United States should adopt]{.underline} a policy
of free trade." Like the object of evaluation in a proposition of value,
[the agent is the subject of the sentence. 2. The verb
should]{.underline}---the first part of a verb phrase [that urges
action]{.underline}. 3. An action verb to follow should in the
should-verb combination. [For example, should adopt]{.underline} here
[means to put a]{.underline} program or [policy into action though
governmental means]{.underline}. 4. A specification of directions or a
limitation of the action desired. The phrase free trade, for example,
gives direction and limits to the topic, which would, for example,
eliminate consideration of increasing tariffs, discussing diplomatic
recognition, or discussing interstate commerce. Propositions of policy
deal with future action. Nothing has yet occurred. [The entire debate is
about whether something ought to occur.]{.underline} What you agree to
do, then, when you accept the affirmative side in such a debate is to
offer sufficient and compelling reasons for an audience to perform the
future action that you propose.

#### Security cooperation refers exclusively to [inter-military cooperation]{.underline} authorized explicitly by US Code.

fall under security cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark} [as
well.]{.underline} We use the term security sector assistance for
simplicity, and distinguish where these additional security cooperation
activities are relevant. The U.S. government does not typically define
Foreign Military Sales as assistance, but we believe it should, and that
it ought to factor Direct Commercial Sales into its assistance planning
as well. Both types of sales can lead to sustained U.S. engagement with
a partner in the form of training, maintenance, and sustainment for the
purchased items.

Over the last several years, the national security enterprise has, with
a great many fits and starts, endeavored to shift its broader focus ---
from weapons systems to diplomacy --- away from counter-terrorism and
toward strategic competition with state actors. As part of this shift,
policymakers have attempted to realign security assistance to contribute
more directly to strategic competition, primarily by creating new
resources for security assistance in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region.
The European Deterrence Initiative, launched in 2014, has allocated
around \$6 billion annually to enhance America's deterrent posture
vis-à-vis Russia. It has been supplemented by the Ukraine Security
Assistance Initiative, authorized by Congress in Fiscal Year 2016 to
provide \$250 million in security assistance to bolster Ukraine's
security. Congress also created the Southeast Asia Maritime Security
Initiative in 2014, later re-designated as the Indo-Pacific Maritime
Security Initiative, and funded it as a five-year, \$425 million
security assistance effort, which it has since extended through FY2025.
This program is intended to improve the ability of Southeast and East
Asian nations to address growing Chinese assertiveness in the South
China Sea. In the FY2021 defense bill currently being finalized,
Congress is set to authorize a Pacific Deterrence Initiative, modeled on
the European Deterrence Initiative, with as much as \$6 billion annually
to improve U.S. posture in the Asia-Pacific region, reportedly with a
significant security assistance component.

These efforts have been laudable, but far from sufficient. The European
Deterrence Initiative has largely been used to shift enduring costs for
U.S. military presence in Europe into the Overseas Contingency
Operations portion of the defense budget. It has also dedicated the vast
majority of funds to posture and equipment pre-positioning, with little
attention to security assistance beyond combined exercises --- a
significant missed opportunity. The Ukraine Security Assistance
Initiative has been managed insularly by the U.S. Europe Command, which
has bypassed synchronization with other Defense Department and U.S.
government stakeholders, leading to a focus on the provision of
"training and equipment at the expense of developing a long-term
strategic vision and implementation of meaningful defense reform." In
the Asia-Pacific, the Maritime Security Initiative has shown promise,
but its relatively limited funding has failed to significantly
contribute to a rebalance of assistance toward the region, and it has
largely funded projects with little deterrent value. Incoming U.S.
Indo-Pacific Commander Adm. Philip Davidson declared, "China is now
capable of controlling the South China Sea in all scenarios short of war
with the United States." Moreover, none of these initiatives have
prioritized partner security sector governance --- a vital element of
any strategy that seeks to shape the behavior of U.S. allies and
partners. As Congress considers the Pacific Deterrence Initiative, it is
essential that these mistakes --- failure to integrate security
assistance with other instruments of national power, overemphasis on
posture at the expense of cooperation, and too little ambition for
assistance initiatives --- are not repeated. Even avoiding them,
however, will go only so far in terms of optimizing security sector
assistance for the challenges ahead. The U.S. government should also
address broader challenges with the way security sector assistance is
prioritized and executed.

Still an Outmoded Instrument

To increase the effectiveness of security sector assistance for
strategic competition, the United States should address deficiencies
related to where and how it uses this assistance. Currently, assistance
is focused on the wrong countries and being used to build the wrong
capabilities. Assistance remains over-directed toward countries in the
Middle East, Africa, and South and Central Asia, rather than to those in
Europe and Southeast Asia where the main competition with Russia and
China occurs. There are several reasons for this disparity.

First, annual commitments to Israel and Egypt --- totaling \$3.3 billion
and \$1.3 billion, respectively --- eat up a large portion of the
Foreign Military Financing budget. The origins of U.S. munificence to
both countries is linked to the "payoff for peace," that is, the U.S.
commitment to Israel and Egypt after they signed the 1979 Camp David
Accords. Distinct from the Foreign Military Sales program, through which
the State Department brokers purchases of U.S.-made defense articles and
defense services by foreign partners, the Foreign Military Financing
program provides grants and loans to help partners, generally
lower-income countries, purchase those articles and services. It is
intended to be the premier program for building the capabilities of
frontline allies and partners. Given its purpose, one would think that
the United States would be steering more Foreign Military Financing
toward Europe and Asia.

Second, the 9/11 attacks brought new requirements: promoting
counter-terrorism cooperation and rapidly building the capacity of local
part­ner forces, especially the creation or enhancement of tactical
units, to address "urgent and emergent threats." This naturally led to a
focus on countries where terrorists operated or might take root, which
reinforced the geographic focus on the Middle East, and expanded it to
include countries in Central and South Asia. This focus was especially
marked at the Defense Department. The amount of assistance it
administers climbed significantly since 9/11, and totaled just over
\$7.5 billion in the FY2021 budget request. Approximately \$6.5 billion
comes from contingency funds for capacity building in Afghanistan, Iraq,
and other conflict zones. Supporting these conflicts created additional
security assistance cost centers among partners that played critical
roles supporting counter-terrorism operations and U.S. logistics
footprints. For example, Pakistan received over \$23 billion in security
assistance and military reimbursements as a result of its importance to
the United States as a counter-terrorism partner after 9/11. Jordan has
also experienced a marked increase in assistance over the same period,
receiving close to \$10 billion.

Overall, the United States spends about \$20 billion annually on
security sector assistance, of which only approximately 8 percent is
allotted to Europe, East Asia, and the Pacific, according to Security
Assistance Monitor. Addressing this imbalance will require the
departments of State and Defense to reprioritize their budget requests,
and Congress to cease earmarking security sector assistance dollars
based on outmoded objectives.

The overriding focus on counter-terrorism in U.S. security sector
assistance programs and national security strategy more broadly over the
past two decades has not only contributed to its orientation toward the
Middle East, Africa, and South and Central Asia. It also compounded
challenges related to how the United States uses assistance,
specifically America's emphasis on countering urgent threats and on
capacity building for counter-terrorism or special operations units.
Where the State Department provides assistance to civilian security
sector forces and institutions in other countries, it overemphasizes
building tactical capabilities for law enforcement (that is, training
small operational units on narrow capabilities like interdicting
narcotraffickers or conducting counterterrorism raids) at the expense of
the administrative capacity and professionalism of these forces and
institutions. Defense Department assistance has similarly focused on
building the tactical capabilities of partner militaries. Such tactical
assistance --- which often includes status-signaling weapons systems and
resources to supplement partner personnel training budgets --- is often
prioritized by partners as well, particularly in the absence of
effective U.S. messaging on the importance of broader reforms.

The U.S. emphasis on counter-terrorism led to a buildup of Special
Operations Command and the services' special operations forces
components as well, and a commensurate focus on building the capacity of
their special operations counterparts in other countries. Although the
services dispense assistance, they don't invest much in terms of the
planning necessary to tie the execution of this assistance to either
specific objectives or longer-term engagements. Other than the Army's
Security Force Assistance Brigades, the services don't organize for the
security sector assistance mission. Even in the Asia-Pacific, the main
focus of assistance prior to the Maritime Security Initiative was the
special operations forces capacity-building mission in the Philippines.
This focus on special operations force has left the services, and U.S.
partners' conventional forces, out of the equation in many places. Iraq
and Afghanistan are a notable exception, but even in these countries the
United States has focused on building specific types of military units
with a heavy emphasis on partner special operations capacity.

While the United States has directed security sector assistance toward
the Middle East and South and Central Asia, and focused more on building
partners' tactical capacity for counter-terrorism, Russia and China are
using aggressive military pressure to coerce neighbors and compete in
new domains, such as cyber and space. They are also using instruments of
statecraft outside the traditional security arena, such as economic
pressure, lawfare, and even technical standards-setting. For example,
China has used commercially flagged fishing vessels to perform
militia-like functions in support of its activities around South China
Sea features. Russia has used its cyber capabilities to disrupt critical
infrastructure, interfere in elections, undermine political leaders, and
spread disinformation throughout NATO-aligned Eastern Europe. The United
States has failed to keep pace --- either on its own in terms of its use
of all instruments of national power, or in terms of the security
assistance it provides partners to enhance their capabilities to mount
effective responses and build resilience.

Optimizing Security Sector Assistance

If security assistance is to be an effective tool in strategic
competition, then the U.S. government needs to step up its game.
Washington should develop a sophisticated, integrated planning process
at the State Department and Department of Defense for security
assistance; significantly increase the Foreign Military Financing
budget, or redirect spending from the Middle East and North Africa to
Asia and Eastern Europe; use security assistance to convey strategic
messages to both rivals and partners; and feature human rights
considerations more prominently when engaging in arms sales. This would
require the United States to address underlying deficiencies in
planning, prioritization, and execution in ways that account for the
unique challenges that Russian and Chinese approaches to competition
bring: the use of disinformation, private security contractors, cyber
tools, and civilian and commercial actors such as commercial fishing
fleets. This is not to suggest that Washington should look to security
sector assistance as the solution to all of its national security
challenges --- far from it. Rather, assistance should be better
integrated with other instruments of national power. The following
recommendations are intended to close the gap between where the United
States currently is regarding its use of security sector assistance and
where it needs to be to compete effectively. Some of these
recommendations are focused more squarely on China and Russia, whereas
others relate to broader reforms to the security sector assistance
enterprise.

First, it is essential to create coordinated, department-wide planning
processes at the departments of State and Defense. The U.S. government
is hamstrung by inefficient and incoherent planning and coordination
processes that do not allocate assistance based on U.S. foreign policy
priorities, country prioritization, availability of resources, and
regional and country-specific assumptions. Congressional earmarks make
prioritization more difficult, but getting rid of them won't solve the
problem. Policymakers should recognize the fundamentally
interdisciplinary nature of many aspects of strategic competition and
begin to break down stovepipes both within and between key agencies
involved in the planning and execution of security assistance.
Interagency coordination should move beyond mere deconfliction and
concurrence toward a truly collaborative real-time planning and
response. Lack of coordination also exists within departments, which
should reform their assistance planning processes. Of equal importance,
security sector assistance planning and prioritization should account
for the fact that China and Russia are mounting sustained challenges to
governance and rule of law at the regional, national, and multinational
levels. Advancing governance and rule of law therefore should be a key
aim of assistance.

**[The [State]{.mark} Department [has a wider mandate for security
assistance]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [encompassing both military aid and
assistance for civilians. It is also supposed to use security assistance
[to advance broader,]{.mark} more long-term [objectives like trade and
investment]{.mark}, efforts to help allies and partners develop an
[innovation]{.mark} base, [and]{.mark} major [diplomatic
initiatives]{.mark}]{.underline}. To fulfill this mission, the State
Department should develop a planning process that elevates common
interagency objectives for assistance, deconflicts competing objectives
where necessary, identifies security assistance resources projected to
be available for the period of time necessary to achieve such
objectives, and recommends the allocation of assistance based on U.S.
foreign policy priorities. Those priorities should be derived from the
next administration's national security strategy and informed by the
availability of resources, and regional and country-specific
assumptions. State also needs to create a framework to guide the use of
assistance as dictated by the above planning process in alignment with
other instruments of national power, and a framework for factoring in
how arms sales --- both Foreign Military Sales and Direct Commercial
Sales --- might affect U.S. security assistance planning and broader
U.S. foreign policy objectives. Last year, the House of Representatives
passed a State Authorization Act that required these and other reforms,
but it has languished in the Senate since then.

Defense Department assistance should focus narrowly on four inherently
military objectives: supporting State Department-coordinated efforts to
build long-term capacity so that an ally or partner can manage its own
security challenges; achieving a fundamental improvement in U.S. posture
to prevail (including via coalitions) in a potential contingency, for
example by assisting a partner to build a deep-water port or develop the
capability to contribute in a specific role to potential coalition
operations; generating short-term capacity when deemed necessary to
achieve strategic objectives or improving interoperability for a
specific goal; and responding to real-time developments, such as
deterrent signaling, personnel recovery, or humanitarian response.
Defense Department planners should be required to identify the
objective(s) they're serving and justify their plans on that basis. They
also should be conducting a rigorous analysis to identify gaps in
Pentagon plans for contingency scenarios involving near-peer competitors
or other real-time developments that could impact U.S. interests, and
basing priorities for security assistance on those gaps. Stronger links
between contingency planning and security cooperation will help focus
Defense Department security assistance and advance strategic
competition.

Second, a more sophisticated and coordinated planning process should
lead the United States to redirect security assistance to U.S. allies
and partners in Asia and Eastern Europe, and expand the nature of
assistance provided. The U.S. government has begun shifting some
assistance, such as Section 333 capacity building administered by the
Pentagon, away from U.S. Central Command countries to countries in the
U.S. European Command and U.S. Indo-Pacific Command regions. The State
and Defense departments need to accelerate this shift to compete more
effectively with Russia and China. The United States should be using
Foreign Military Financing, as well as Maritime Security Initiative
funding and other programs, to help regional states in Asia develop
anti-access/area denial systems to challenge Chinese power-projection
operations. The departments of State, Defense, and Homeland Security
should also be coordinating to increase support for U.S. Coast Guard
cooperation with allies and partners to challenge China's white hull
strategy.

Realizing a significant reallocation of security assistance in support
of strategic competition will require increasing the overall budget for
Foreign Military Financing. These budgets have declined from a peak of
\$9.4 billion in FY2015 to the current year's \$7.5 billion, while the
importance placed on security cooperation with allies and partners and
the variety of threats they face have increased. The amount of such an
increase will depend on the needs of key allies and partners, and
whether Congress is willing to reduce Foreign Military Financing to
Israel and Egypt, which in some years accounts for nearly two-thirds of
the program's budget. Unquestionably, the State Department can improve
its prioritization of the remaining amount, which is spread across more
than 100 partners globally, but those limited resources go only so far.

In our experience, selling Congress on an injection of resources or on
reductions to Israel and Egypt will require considerable effort. The
State Department would need not only to provide a compelling strategy
for how resources that can be freed up by reducing commitments to Israel
and Egypt will be used to improve America's national security posture.
It also will need to provide a convincing assessment that such
reductions will not infringe on Israel's qualitative military edge in
the region or lead to a breakdown in the peace treaties between Israel
and Egypt. We believe these crucial U.S. interests --- Israel's security
and regional stability --- can be maintained at lower aid levels.
However, we are also realistic about the political challenges that make
such a shift so difficult regardless of what any policy analysis
suggests. For this reason, although we typically would recommend
starting with a reallocation of existing resources before increasing the
overall budget, in this instance we recognize that directing more money
to the problem might be the least-worst option. A compelling case can be
made for new resources and authorities to expand the types of aid
provided under Foreign Military Financing --- including to address the
gaps identified above, **[[such as cyber security and law
enforcement]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The argument will be strongest if it
is articulated within broader strategies for competing with China and
Russia.

[[In addition to Foreign Military Financing]{.underline}]{.mark}, there
are a mix of [[other programs]{.underline}]{.mark} the United States
could use [[to increase the capacity]{.underline}]{.mark} and
capabilities [[of]{.underline}]{.mark} key Eastern European [[NATO
allies]{.underline}]{.mark}. As Max Bergmann observed on these pages a
few years ago, Congress is likely to be unwilling to provide much
assistance funding through traditional grant methods, especially as
Eastern European countries are wealthier than typical grant assistance
recipients. This approach is deeply flawed: Many of Eastern Europe's
governments lack the economic wherewithal to engage in the types of
military development necessary to compete with Russia. Moreover, the
United States has clear and urgent goals in the region that should not
be left dependent on the vicissitudes of partners' budget politics. At
the same time, we agree with Bergmann that the United States cannot and
should not shoulder too much of the responsibility for these countries,
which should demonstrate a commitment to acquisitions. One of the
problems with Foreign Military Sales, though, is that U.S. weapons
systems that Eastern European militaries would need to compete with
Russia are top-of-the-line and likely unaffordable for midtier
countries. Providing excess defense articles is one workaround, but this
puts recipients at the mercy of what is available. Bergmann's
recommendation that the United States provide a mix of [[grants and
loans to help NATO countries make acquisitions]{.underline}]{.mark}
themselves is a fine one, and we would offer complementary or
alternative approaches as well. The U.S. government could consider [[a
lend-lease program]{.underline}]{.mark} in which equipment itself is
provided via a loan or low-cost lease for a period of time to be used in
an agreed-upon manner, after which the recipient could purchase the
equipment at a reduced cost. [[Pooled sales and multilateral cooperative
platforms]{.underline}]{.mark} modeled on the Movement Coordination
Center Europe are other promising solutions. Any one of these models
would be an improvement on the current approach.

As China, Russia, and others compete across a range of [[domains
stretching beyond traditional military strength]{.underline}]{.mark} ---
[[cyber security, law enforcement, and
disinformation]{.underline}]{.mark} --- the U.S. government should
enhance its ability to provide timely, relevant assistance in these
areas. In our experience in government, American allies and partners
routinely ask for this assistance. Yet, U.S. capacity building in each
of these areas is immature. [[Cyber security assistance]{.mark} is
meagerly resourced and often]{.underline} ad hoc, with limited
assistance programs spread incoherently across government agencies.
Likewise, [[intelligence and law enforcement capacity **building are
limited**]{.underline}]{.mark} and often plagued by turf battles.
Enabling allies and partners to counter disinformation represents an
emerging area of focus, and Washington should rise to the occasion. In
many of these areas, effective governance is often one of the most
crucial gaps America's allies and partners confront. To meet these
challenges, the United States should reimagine security sector
assistance, factor in its impact on governance and rule of law, and
increase the involvement of the departments of Homeland Security,
Justice, and Treasury.

#### Our impact is [debatability]{.underline}---there are two internal links:

#### Limits. A [bounded topic]{.underline} serves as a [predictable stasis point]{.underline} for debate that guarantees [thematic coherence]{.underline}. Absent [defined limits]{.underline}, debate's competitive incentives create a [race to the margins]{.underline} which [distorts topic research]{.underline}.

#### Ground. A [pre-defined controversy]{.underline} ensures a [vibrant lit base]{.underline} and [in-depth clash]{.underline}, but it's [unreasonable to prepare]{.underline} for alternative frameworks with the ground allocated to us by the parameters of the resolution. All 2AC defense to this claim will rely on [concessionary ground]{.underline}, which [isn't a stable basis]{.underline} for a year of debate.

### Anderson---T Isn't Violent

#### Analogies between limits and violent exclusion are [faulty]{.underline}---argumentative exclusion is [inevitable]{.underline}, but topicality ensures it occurs around [reciprocal lines]{.underline}. 

**Anderson, 6**---Andrew W. Mellon Professor of Humanities and English
at Brown University (Amanda, "Reply to My Critic(s)," Criticism, Vol.
48, No. 2, 281-290, dml)

My recent book, The Way We Argue Now, has in a sense two theses. In the
first place, the book makes the case for the importance of [debate
and]{.underline} argument to any vital democratic or pluralistic
intellectual culture. This is in many ways an unexceptional position,
but the premise of the book is that the claims of [reasoned argument are
often **trumped**]{.underline}, within the current intellectual terrain,
[by appeals to]{.underline} cultural [**identity** and]{.underline} what
I gather more broadly under the rubric of **[ethos]{.underline}**, which
includes cultural identity but also forms of ethical piety and
charismatic authority. In promoting [argument as a universal practice
keyed to a human capacity for communicative reason]{.underline}, my book
[is a **critique** of]{.underline} relativism and identity politics, or
[the notion that forms of cultural authenticity or]{.underline} group
[identity have a certain **unquestioned legitimacy**]{.underline}, one
[that **cannot** or **should not** be subjected to the challenges of
**reason** or **principle**]{.underline}, precisely [because
reason]{.underline} and what is often called \"false universalism\"
[are, according to this pattern of thinking, **always** involved in
forms of **exclusion**, **power**, or **domination**]{.underline}. My
book insists, by contrast, that [argument is a form of
**respect**]{.underline}, that the ideals of democracy, whether
conceived from a nationalist or an internationalist perspective, rely
fundamentally upon procedures of argumentation and debate in order to
legitimate themselves and to keep their central institutions vital. And
[the idea that one should be **protected from debate**, that argument is
somehow **injurious** to persons if it **does not honor** their desire
to have their basic beliefs and claims and solidarities **accepted
without challenge**, is **strenuously opposed**. As is the notion that
**any** attempt to ask people to agree upon processes of **reason-giving
argument** is somehow **necessarily** to impose a **coercive
norm**]{.underline}, one [that will disable the **free expression** and
**performance** of identities]{.underline}, feelings, or solidarities.
Disagreement is, by the terms of my book, a form of respect, not a form
of disrespect. And by disagreement, I don\'t mean simply to say that we
should expect disagreement rather than agreement, which is a frequently
voiced---if misconceived---criticism of Habermas. Of course we should
expect disagreement. My point is that we should focus on the moment of
dissatisfaction in the face of disagreement---the internal dynamic in
argument that imagines argument might be the beginning of \[End Page
281\] a process of persuasion and exchange that could end in agreement
(or partial agreement). [For those who advocate **reconciling**
ourselves to disagreements rather than **arguing them
out**]{.underline}, by contrast, [there is a
**complacent**---and]{.underline} in some versions, [even
**celebratory**---attitude toward fixed disagreement]{.underline}.
Refusing these options, I make the case for dissatisfied disagreement in
the final chapter of the book and argue that [people should be willing
to **justify** their positions in dialogue with one
another]{.underline}, especially if they hope to live together in a
post-traditional pluralist society.

One example of the trumping of argument by ethos is the form that was
taken by the late stage of the Foucault/Habermas debate, where an appeal
to ethos---specifically, an appeal to Foucault\'s style of ironic or
negative critique, often seen as most in evidence in the interviews,
where he would playfully refuse labels or evade direct answers---was
used to exemplify an alternative to the forms of argument employed by
Habermas and like-minded critics. (I should pause to say that I provide
this example, and the framing summary of the book that surrounds it, not
to take up airtime through expansive self-reference, but because neither
of my respondents provided any contextualizing summary of the book\'s
central arguments, though one certainly gets an incremental sense of the
book\'s claims from Bruce Robbins. Because I don\'t assume that readers
of this forum have necessarily read the book, and because I believe that
it is the obligation of forum participants to provide sufficient context
for their remarks, I will perform this task as economically as I can,
with the recognition that it might have carried more weight if provided
by a respondent rather than the author.)

The Foucauldian counter-critique importantly emphasizes a relation
between style and position, but it obscures (1) the importance or value
of the Habermasian critique and (2) the possibility that the other side
of the debate might have its own ethos to advocate, one that has
precisely to do with an ethos of argument, an ideal of reciprocal debate
that involves taking distance on one\'s pre-given forms of identity or
the norms of one\'s community, both so as to talk across differences and
to articulate one\'s claims in relation to shared and even universal
ideals. And this leads to the second thesis of the book, the insistence
that an emphasis on ethos and character is interestingly present if not
widely recognized in contemporary theory, and one of the ways its
vitality and existential pertinence makes itself felt (even despite the
occurrence of the kinds of unfair trumping moves I have mentioned). We
often fail to notice this, because identity has so uniformly come to
mean sociological, ascribed, or group identity---race, gender, class,
nationality, ethnicity, sexuality, and so forth. Instances of the move
toward character and ethos include the later Foucault (for whom ethos is
a central concept), cosmopolitanism (whose aspiration it is to turn
universalism into an ethos), and, more controversially, proceduralist
ethics and politics (with its emphasis on sincerity and civility).
Another version of this attentiveness to ethos and character appears in
contemporary pragmatism, with its insistence on casualness of attitude,
or insouciance in the face of \[End Page 282\]
contingency---recommendations that get elevated into full-fledged
exemplary personae in Richard Rorty\'s notion of the \"ironist\" or
Barbara Herrnstein Smith\'s portrait of the \"postmodern skeptic.\"
These examples---and the larger claim they support---are meant to defend
theory as still living, despite the many reports of its demise, and in
fact still interestingly and incessantly re-elaborating its relation to
practice. This second aspect of the project is at once descriptive,
motivated by the notion that characterology within theory is
intrinsically interesting, and critical, in its attempt to identify how
characterology can itself be used to cover or evade the claims of
rational argument, as in appeals to charismatic authority or in what I
identify as narrow personifications of theory (pragmatism, in its
insistence on insouciance in the face of contingency, is a prime example
of this second form). And as a complement to the critical agenda, there
is a reconstructive agenda as well, an attempt to recuperate liberalism
and proceduralism, in part by advocating the possibility, as I have
suggested, of an ethos of argument.

Robbins, in his extraordinarily rich and challenging response, zeroes in
immediately on a crucial issue: who is to say exactly when argument is
occurring or not, and what do we do when there is disagreement over the
fundamentals (the primary one being over what counts as proper
reasoning)? Interestingly, Robbins approaches this issue after first
observing a certain tension in the book: on the one hand, The Way We
Argue Now calls for dialogue, debate, argument; on the other, its
project is \"potentially something a bit stricter, or pushier: getting
us all to agree on what should and should not count as true argument.\"
What this point of entry into the larger issue reveals is a kind of blur
that the book, I am now aware, invites. On the one hand, the book
anatomizes academic debates, and in doing so is quite \"debaterly.\"
This can give the impression that what I mean by argument is a very
specific form unique to disciplinary methodologies in higher education.
But the book is not generally advocating a narrow practice of formal and
philosophical argumentation in the culture at large, however much its
author may relish adherence to the principle of non-contradiction in
scholarly argument. I take pains to elaborate an ethos of argument that
is linked to democratic debate and the forms of dissent that
constitutional patriotism allows and even promotes. In this sense, while
argument here is necessarily contextualized sociohistorically, the
concept is not merely academic. It is a practice seen as integral to
specific political forms and institutions in modern democracies, and to
the more general activity of critique within modern societies---to the
tradition of the public sphere, to speak in broad terms. Additionally,
insofar as argument impels one to take distance on embedded customs,
norms, and senses of given identity, it is a practice that at once
acknowledges identity, the need to understand the perspectives of
others, and the shared commitment to commonality and generality, to
finding a way to live together under conditions of difference.

More than this: the book also discusses at great length and from several
different angles the issue that Robbins inexplicably claims I entirely
ignore: the \[End Page 283\] question of disagreement about **[what
counts as argument]{.underline}**. In the opening essay, \"Debatable
Performances,\" I fault the proponents of communicative ethics for not
having a broader understanding of public expression, one that would
include the disruptions of spectacle and performance. I return to and
underscore this point in my final chapter, where I espouse a democratic
politics that [can embrace and accommodate a **wide variety** of
expressions and modes]{.underline}. This is certainly a discussion of
what counts as dialogue and hence argument in the broad sense in which I
mean it, and in fact I fully acknowledge that taking distance from
cultural norms and given identities can be advanced not only through
critical reflection, but through ironic critique and defamiliarizing
performance as well. But I do insist---and this is where I take a
position on the fundamental disagreements that have arisen with respect
to communicative ethics---that [when they have an
**effect**]{.underline}, these other dimensions of experience do not
remain unreflective, and insofar as they do become reflective, [they are
contributing to the **very form of reasoned analysis** that their
champions sometimes imagine they must **refuse** in order to liberate
other modes of being (the **affective**, the **narrative**, the
**performative**, the **nonrational**)]{.underline}. If a narrative of
human rights violation is persuasive in court, or in the broader
cultural public sphere, it is because it draws attention to a violation
of humanity that is condemned on principle; [if a performance jolts
people out of their normative understandings]{.underline} of sexuality
and gender, [it prompts forms of understanding that can be **affirmed**
and **communicated** and also can be used to justify **political
positions** and **legislative agendas**]{.underline}.

Robbins claims that I violate my own ideal of dialogue by failing to
engage those who, according to him, are \"\[my\] most significant
antagonists\": Jean-François Lyotard and Jacques Rancière. But it is
simply not true that I fail to address the fundamental concerns that
neither of these thinkers owns in any absolute sense. I might have
addressed their work particularly (there are significant differences
between them), and I think the example of Rancière is a particularly
fruitful one, especially given his own critique of sociological
reductionism (and identity politics), and his universalism, which shares
affinities with the forms of poststructuralist universalism (notably,
Etienne Balibar\'s) that I address in the third chapter of my book. But
the relevant issues of incommensurability of language games or cultural
perspectives, and the question of intractable or \"hardwired\"
exclusion, are adduced and repeatedly critiqued throughout the book,
across a range of disciplines. The debate between the accommodationist
position of Thomas McCarthy and the universalist position of Habermas
addresses these issues straight on, and the discussion of Habermas
clearly maps out the two main alternatives to his position as (1)
incommensurable perspectives and (2) overlapping consensus. The analysis
of Satya Mohanty and Martha Nussbaum is also directly relevant: Mohanty
situates his project with respect to a well-known and parallel debate in
anthropology represented by the opposed positions of Ernest Gellner and
Talal Asad. My emphasis on the newer discussions of accommodation, \[End
Page 284\] rather than the incommensurability theorists (e.g., Lyotard),
is meant to argue for the Habermasian position against its newer and
more interesting challengers, and I also wanted the book to move beyond
the parochial reference points of literary and cultural studies to
engage relevant work in political theory and political philosophy. And
of course I do discuss the work of many influential theorists and
literary critics who oppose the approach I take in the book generally.
But I\'m not going to reproduce my complete range of references: readers
are free to decide for themselves how comprehensive and various the
theoretical landscape is in my book. But I will say in response to
Robbins that my \"primary antagonist\" considered as a position rather
than a set of proper names is consistently present in the book, and
taken on in a number of different ways.

There is a deeper issue at play in Robbins\'s invocation of Lyotard and
Rancière, especially given where his discussion of what he calls my
\"argumentative normativity\" ends up. On the one hand, Robbins wants to
say that the argument I am taking up is no longer relevant, that
\"thankfully\" literary critics have moved past the critique of
Enlightenment. On this account I am sadly unaware that my earlier books
have actually had some influence, and seem to be stuck in an agonistic
position that has no traction, and that at this point constitutes a
regression toward a naively pro-Enlightenment position that is likely to
invite---and that at some level deserves to invite---a strong
reiteration of the critique of Enlightenment. The moves need to be
replayed in slow motion here to discover exactly what is going on, since
the argument is quite kinetic, and involves a dubious framing of my own
project. It is certainly the case that in diagnosing the state of
academic argument in the humanities today, I invoke, as one of the
contributing factors, the excesses involved in the critique of
Enlightenment. It is not the only factor I invoke, but it is certainly
adduced as a major contributing factor to the denigration of reason,
critical distance, and formal argument. I do agree with Robbins that
there are many critics challenging the critique of Enlightenment. There
are also, as it happens, many critics who have walked away from the
debate to do other things. But it remains the case, as Robbins\'s own
response makes clear, that the stronger version of the critique has a
kind of staying power, particularly as a way of asserting political
pedigree in the last instance. Indeed, Robbins must insist that I
resurrect a version of the very form of Enlightenment that was once the
whipping boy of poststructuralism, in order to himself reintroduce a
high-stakes political allegory that will imagine cultural criticism to
be an immediate actor in the current international political landscape.

Let\'s first examine the claim that my book is \"unwittingly\" inviting
a resurrection of the \"Enlightenment-equals-totalitarianism position.\"
[How]{.underline}, one wonders, [could]{.underline} a book [promoting
**argument** and **debate**, and]{.underline} promoting [**reason-giving
practices** as a kind of common ground that should prevail over
assertions of **cultural authenticity**, somehow come to be seen as a
**dangerous resurgence** of bad Enlightenment?]{.underline} Robbins
tells us why: [I want \"**argument on my own
terms**\"]{.underline}---that \[End Page 285\] is, [I want to **impose
reason** on people, which is a form of **power** and **oppression**. But
**what can this possibly mean**? Arguments **stand** or **fall** based
on whether they are **successful** and **persuasive**, even an argument
in favor of argument. It **simply is not the case** that an argument in
favor of the importance of reasoned debate]{.underline} to liberal
democracy [is **tantamount to oppressive power**. To assume so is to
assume]{.underline}, in the manner of Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer,
[that reason is itself **violent**, **inherently**, and that it will
**always mask power** and **enforce exclusions**. But to assume this is
to assume the **very view of Enlightenment reason**]{.underline} that
Robbins claims we are \"thankfully\" well rid of. (I leave to the side
the idea that any individual can proclaim that a debate is over,
thankfully or not.) But [perhaps]{.underline} Robbins will say, \"[I am
not imagining that your argument is **directly** oppressive, but that
what you argue for **would be**, if it were **enforced**]{.underline}.\"
[Yet my book **doesn\'t imagine** or **suggest it is enforceable**; I
simply **argue in favor of**]{.underline}, I promote, [an ethos of
argument within a]{.underline} liberal democratic and **[proceduralist
framework]{.underline}**. As much as Robbins would like to think so,
[neither I nor the books I write can be cast as an arm of the
police]{.underline}.

Robbins wants to imagine a far more direct line of influence from
criticism to political reality, however, and this is why it can be such
a bad thing to suggest norms of argument. Watch as the gloves come off:

[Faced with the prospect of submitting to]{.underline} her version of
[argument]{.underline}---roughly, Habermas\'s version---and of being
thus authorized to disagree only about other, smaller things, [some may
feel that there will have been]{.underline} an end to argument, or [an
**end** to the arguments they **find most interesting**]{.underline}.
With current events in mind, [I would be surprised if there were no
recourse to the metaphor of a]{.underline} regular army facing a
**[guerilla insurrection]{.underline}**, [hinting that Anderson wants to
force her opponents to **dress in uniform**, reside in **well-demarcated
camps** and **capitals** that can be **bombed**, fight by the **rules of
states**]{.underline} (whether the states themselves abide by these
rules or not), and so on---in short, that she wants [to get the battle
onto a terrain where her side will be **assured** of having the **upper
hand**]{.underline}.

Let\'s leave to the side the fact that this is a disowned hypothetical
criticism. (As in, \"Well, okay, yes, those are my gloves, but those are
somebody else\'s hands they will have come off of.\") Because far more
interesting, actually, is [the **sudden elevation of
stakes**]{.underline}. It [is a symptom of the]{.underline} sorry state
of affairs in our profession that it plays out repeatedly this
tragicomic [tendency to give a **grandiose political meaning** to every
object it analyzes or confronts]{.underline}. We have evidence of how
desperate the situation is when we see it in a critic as thoughtful as
Bruce Robbins, where it emerges as the need to allegorize a point about
an [argument]{.underline} in such a way that it [gets cast as the
**equivalent of war atrocities**]{.underline}. It is especially ironic
in light of the fact that to the extent that I do give examples of the
importance of liberal democratic proceduralism, I invoke the disregard
of the protocols of international adjudication in the days leading up to
the invasion of Iraq; I also speak \[End Page 286\] about concerns with
voting transparency. [It is **hard**]{.underline} for me [to see
how]{.underline} my [argument about proceduralism can be associated with
the policies of the **Bush administration** when that]{.underline}
administration has [exhibited a **flagrant disregard of**]{.underline}
democratic **[procedure]{.underline}** and the rule of law. I happen to
think that a renewed focus on proceduralism is a timely venture, which
is why I spend so much time discussing it in my final chapter. But I
hasten to add that [I am **not**]{.underline} interested in
[**imagining** that proceduralism is the **sole political response** to
the needs of cultural criticism in our time]{.underline}: my goal in the
book is to argue for a liberal democratic culture of argument, and to
suggest ways in which argument is not served by trumping appeals to
identity and charismatic authority. I fully admit that my examples are
less political events than academic debates; for those uninterested in
the shape of intellectual arguments, and eager for more direct and
sustained discussion of contemporary politics, the approach will
disappoint. Moreover, there will always be a tendency for a
proceduralist to under-specify substance, and that is partly a
principled decision, since the point is that agreements, compromises,
and policies get worked out through the communicative and political
process. My book is mainly concentrated on evaluating forms of arguments
and appeals to ethos, both those that count as a form of trump card or
distortion, and those that flesh out an understanding of argument as a
universalist practice. There is an intermittent appeal to larger
concerns in the political democratic culture, and that is because I see
connections between the ideal of argument and the ideal of deliberative
democracy. But there is clearly, and indeed necessarily, significant
room for further elaboration here.

There is a way to make Robbins\'s point more narrowly, which would run
something like this: Anderson has a very restricted notion of how
argument should play out, or appear, within academic culture, given the
heavy emphasis on logical consistency and normative coherence and
explicitness. This conception of argument is too narrow (and hence
authoritarian). To this I would reply simply that [logical consistency
and normative coherence and explicitness **do not exhaust** the possible
forms, modes, and strategies of argumentation. There is a
**distinction** to be made between the **identification** of moves that
**stultify**]{.underline} or disarm [**argument**, and an **insistence**
on some sort of **single manner** of reasoned argument. The former I am
**entirely committed** to; the latter **not at all**]{.underline},
despite the fact that I obviously favor a certain style of argument, and
even despite the fact that I am philosophically committed to the claims
of the theory of communicative reason. I do address the issue of diverse
forms and modes of argument in the first and last chapters of the book
(as I discuss above), but it seems that a more direct reflection on the
book\'s own mode of argumentation might have provided the occasion for a
fuller treatment of the issues that trouble Robbins.

[Different genres within academe have **different
conventions**]{.underline}, of course, [and we **can** and **do** make
decisions **all the time** about what **rises** to the **level of
cogency** within specific academic venues, and what
**doesn\'t**]{.underline}. Some of those judgments \[End Page 287\] have
to do with protocols of argument. The book review, for example, is
judged according to whether the reviewer responsibly represents the
scholarship under discussion, seems to have a good grasp of the body of
scholarship it belongs to, and convincingly and fairly points out
strengths and weaknesses. The book forum is a bit looser---one expects
responsible representation of the scholarship under discussion, but it
can be more selectively focused on a key set of issues. And one expects
a bit of provocation, in order to make the exchange readable and
dramatic. But of course [in a forum exchange there is an **implicit
norm** of argument, a tendency to **judge** whether a particular
participant is making a **strong** or a **weak case** in light of the
**competing claims** at play. Much of our time]{.underline} in the
profession [is taken with **judging** the quality of **all manner** of
academic performance, and much of it has to do with **norms of
argument**]{.underline}, however much Robbins may worry about their
potentially coercive nature.

From time to time I myself have wondered whether my book is too
influenced by the modes of academe. But when I read a piece of writing
like the one that Elspeth Probyn produced, I find myself feeling a
renewed commitment to the evaluative norms of responsible scholarship,
and to the idea that clearly agreed-upon genres and protocols of fair
scholarship benefit from explicit affirmation at times. Probyn\'s piece
does not conform at all to the conventions of the forum response. She
may herself be quite delighted that it does not. Robbins may find
himself delighted that she represents a viewpoint that does not agree on
my (totalitarian) fundamentals of forum responses. But I would simply
say that here we do not have fair or reasoned argument, which is one of
the enabling procedures of forum exchanges. Indeed, I hear a different
genre altogether: the venting phone call to a friend or intimate. In
this genre, which I think we are all familiar with, one is not expected
or required to give reasons or evidence, as one is in academic argument.
Here\'s how the phone call might go: \"Ugh. I have to write a response
to this awful book. I agreed to this because I thought the book had an
interesting title; it\'s called The Way We Argue Now. But I can\'t get
through it; it isn\'t at all what I expected. I find myself alternately
bored and irritated. It\'s so from the center---totally American
parochial, and I just hate the style: polemical in a
slam-bam-thank-you-ma\'am way---really quite mean-spirited. She\'s so
arrogant. And you wouldn\'t believe the so-called critique of Foucault.
I don\'t know, I think I\'m just sick of abstract theory---I mean,
aren\'t we past this? It\'s so stultifying. I wish there were some way
to get out of the commitment. I don\'t know how I\'m ever going to get
to it anyway, with all my journalism deadlines.\" The friend: \"That
sounds awful. But just use the occasion to write about something else,
something you think is important. Write about yourself. Direct attention
to a book that you do like. Whatever you do, don\'t spend too much time
on it. And definitely call her out on the American centrism.\"

Do we really want to overhear this kind of conversation when we turn to
the review section of a journal like Criticism? Of what intellectual
value is it to know \[End Page 288\] Probyn\'s casual reactions to a
book she won\'t bother responsibly to describe or engage, unless of
course we accord to Probyn some sort of authority in advance that makes
argument unnecessary. That she herself believes in such
argument-by-authority is evident when she tells us, \"As Stuart Hall
would say, along with any undergraduate in my classes, \'A discourse is
a group of statements that provide a language for talking about a
particular kind of knowledge about a topic.\'\" This is the extent of
Probyn\'s searing critique of the problem with advocating debate
generally. But note that it relies, first, upon the invocation of an
authority, Stuart Hall, and then upon the implication that her students
have all entirely absorbed her own channeling of that authority. Probyn
is entirely unbothered, moreover, that the undergraduates in her classes
unblinkingly accept this empty statement without protest or challenge or
further inquiry into its aimless specificity.

Probyn\'s piece is a mixture of affective fallacy, argument by
authority, and bald ad hominem. [There\'s a **pattern**
here]{.underline}: precisely [the tendency to **personalize argument**
and to foreground]{.underline} what Wendy Brown has called \"**[states
of injury]{.underline}**.\" Probyn says, for example, that she \"felt
ostracized by the book\'s content and style.\" Ostracized? [Argument
here is seen as **directly harming** persons, and this is]{.underline}
precisely [the state of affairs to which I **object**. Argument is **not
injurious** to persons. **Policies** are injurious to persons and
institutionalized practices can **alienate** and **exclude**. But
argument itself is **not directly harmful**; once one says it is, one is
**very close** to a logic of **censorship**. The **most productive
thing** to do in an open academic culture]{.underline} (and in societies
that aspire to freedom and democracy) [when you encounter]{.underline} a
book or [an argument that you disagree with is to **produce a
response**]{.underline} or a book [that states your disagreement. But to
assert that the book itself **directly harms you** is tantamount to
saying that you **do not believe** in argument or in the **free
exchange** of ideas, that your claim to injury somehow **damns your
opponent\'s ideas**]{.underline}.

When Probyn isn\'t symptomatic, she\'s just downright sloppy. One could
work to build up the substance of points that she throws out the car
window as she screeches on to her next destination, but life is short,
and those with considered objections to liberalism and proceduralism
would not be particularly well served by the exercise. As far as I can
tell, Probyn thinks my discussion of universalism is of limited
relevance (though far more appealing when put, by others, in more
comfortingly equivocating terms), but [she\'s certain my critique of
appeals to identity is simply **not able to accommodate** the importance
of identity in social and political life]{.underline}. As I make clear
throughout the book, and particularly in my discussion of the headscarf
debate in France, [identity is likely to be at the **center** of key
arguments about life]{.underline} in plural democracies; [my point is
**not** that identity is **not relevant**, but simply that it should not
be used to **trump** or **stifle** argument]{.underline}.

### Andreotti---Humility

#### Debate's [not]{.underline} about finding the perfect solution, it's about [learning from the failures of our imperfect ones]{.underline}---the belief that any one debate can translate to material outcomes is [naïve at best]{.underline} and [complicit in the systems they critique at worst]{.underline}---topical advocacy encourages an ethos of [humility]{.underline} and [interconnectedness]{.underline} which can engender [ontological shifts]{.underline} in society and [confront the crises of modernity]{.underline}---but that requires a [willingness to be wrong]{.underline}

**Andreotti, 18**---Canada Research Chair in Race, Inequalities and
Global Change at University of British Columbia and Associate Professor
in the Faculty of Education (Vanessa de Oliviera, interviewed by Scott
Baker, "Countless Rebellions -- Decolonizing education,"
<https://mcconnellfoundation.ca/interview/vanessa-andreotti/>, dml)

Andreotti: When I talk about **[humility]{.underline}**, it [is about
**sitting at the edge**, understanding the **limits of knowing**, not
only of **our own knowledge**, the limits of **knowing itself**, the
limits of **making sense of the world**]{.underline} --- understanding
that it's possible to reason with other senses. [Although we see
ourselves as]{.underline} individuated or as [**individuals**, we are
**interwoven with everything else**. If we are going to **engage with
the world in change-making**, it would be important to both **understand
the contradictions** and **paradoxes** of our own ways of knowing, but
also to **sit at the edge of the way of being** that engendered this way
of knowing so that we can engage with the world **without trying to
project our delusions onto the world itself**, without trying to
**over-determine** both the **direction** and **how the relationship
should happen**]{.underline}. So, starting from a place of not knowing
and engaging with the world as if we are not individuals, as we inhibit
each other in multiple temporalities, and taking responsibility for this
form of engagement, I think, for me, is what humility entails.

If we are able to be humble and accept that we exist as a part of a much
larger society and ecosystem, how do we then go about creating systems
change?

Andreotti: A system rises, peaks, and starts its decline. And,
generally, [when a **system is in decline**, a lot of people want to
**walk out** from that system]{.underline}. This is the work of Debra
Friesen. But one important thing to remember [when we are walking
out]{.underline} is that [**we can't create a different system from the
hot ashes of the system that hasn't yet cooled down**. In many
alternative movements, people **want results straight away**. They want
to **substitute the system** that they had before for something that
they **already know that they can control**. This is]{.underline} just
again [a **replacement** of the securities that were promised by the
system, the other system, and now these promises are **perceived as
broken**. But what if we understand the promises of the systems as
**unrealistic from the outset** and start to look for other
securities?]{.underline} In that sense, [what we need is **not to
replace it straight away**, because **we can't**]{.underline},
basically. [We will end up **reproducing the old system whether we like
it or not**]{.underline}. But what if [what we need to do is
**experimentation**]{.underline}? [If we want to experiment, we need to
**start from a place of not knowing**, because **otherwise it's not an
experiment**, it's you trying to **engineer something**]{.underline}.
But [if it is an experiment]{.underline}, you are kind of doing it, [you
are designing something that **you know is going to fail**, and the
**learning from this failure** is the **most important
thing**]{.underline}.

How do you go about making sure that you fail in the right way?

Andreotti: The same way that a new system cannot be built on the hot
ashes of the old, the role of improvisation here is that the
difficulties that we face --- [this sitting at the limits of what is
perceived as possible of what we know, the **learning that can take
place** in that space, through **failure**]{.underline} --- [becomes a
**fertilizer for something else that happens when these ashes cool
down**, the ashes of the old system]{.underline}. [What]{.underline} I
think [is important]{.underline} here [is **not to see failure as
failure**. Failure is also **success**. It's success in terms of the
**learning that it generates** --- for the **possibility that it
opens**, in terms of the **new world that it can create**]{.underline}.
As a researcher, for example, in an experiment, [if I **keep doing the
same experiment**, with the **same results**, it becomes not only a
**waste of energy**, but, because I'm **not deriving any learning out of
it**, also **boring**!]{.underline} There is a sense of it in this
experimentation and improvisation, that [in order for it to be
**fulfilling**, and **rewarding**, and **exciting**, and **fun** even,
it needs to be **learning**. And it needs to be **learning from
failure**. And it needs to **make mistakes** too!]{.underline} [It's
**part of the process**.]{.underline}

So, [how can we **turn ourselves to this other way of experimenting**
where we are not afraid, we are actually **quite okay with both
failing** and **succeeding**]{.underline} and stumbling and falling and
getting back up, [and **not being overwhelmed** or **exhausted** by this
process]{.underline} --- [by our **desire to get
somewhere**]{.underline}, right? I keep saying that [if you think this
is going to be a **process from A to B**]{.underline}, the only thing I
can tell you is that [you're going to be **frustrated**. For a **long
time**. But if you understand that there's **no end**, and that the
**process itself**]{.underline}, the path itself, [is what you're
looking for]{.underline} --- and [with all its **problems**, and
**paradoxes** and **contradictions**]{.underline} --- [it's **joy** that
comes out of **walking together**, and **breathing together** and
**learning together**, then]{.underline}, I think, [we are in a **very
different footing** to be able to **tackle the crisis** that we have to
tackle **together**]{.underline}.

[It can be tempting to conceive a system's change in terms of
**ourselves**, our **communities**, or even the **societies** within
which we live, but]{.underline} as Vanessa teaches, by [thinking about
change vis-à-vis **those who are coming next**]{.underline}, it [opens
up a **different approach**.]{.underline}

Andreotti: So, [if we have this **responsibility towards those who are
coming next** rather than the responsibility towards **making us become
the heroes**]{.underline} of the new system, [or the **engineers** of
the new system, we]{.underline} are going to **[shift the
focus]{.underline}** of our attention and [of our learning from the
**outcomes** to this **process** of]{.underline} walking and
[experimenting knowing that it will require falls and
stumbles]{.underline} and rest and laughter and being naked, [and
helping each other in the journey **rather** than trying to **quickly
replace** the securities that we lost with the **same securities
disguised as something else**]{.underline}.

What becomes possible if we change the way we view the world?

Andreotti: So, [if we can get to a point where we are **present to the
world**]{.underline}, we are disarmed towards the world, [and we are
**decentered**, we are **with the world**, **extremely attentive** to
what we are being called to do with others in order to **shift our
ontological reality** and also **operate within this reality with
responsibility**]{.underline}, then we are onto something else. And [I'm
not saying that this is going to be **necessarily immediately
better**]{.underline}. I'm saying that [this is going to **open up other
possibilities** that are **viable** --- but they are **unthinkable** or
**unimaginable at the moment**.]{.underline}

### Battistoni---Organizing

#### Debate is valuable because it [iteratively teaches]{.underline} the skills of [persuasive organizing]{.underline} and [relationality]{.underline} through [face-to-face dialogue]{.underline} over [what is at stake]{.underline} and [how to solve it]{.underline}---this is the [foundation]{.underline} of successful movement organizing, which [outweighs]{.underline} and [turns]{.underline} the aff.

**Battistoni, 19**---editor at Jacobin, Department of Political Science,
Yale University (Alyssa, "Spadework: On political organizing,"
<https://nplusonemag.com/issue-34/politics/spadework/>, dml)

By the time I started organizing so much that it felt like a full-time
job, it was the spring of 2016, and I had plenty of company. Around the
country there were high-profile efforts to organize magazines, fast-food
places, and nursing homes. Erstwhile Occupiers became involved in the
Bernie Sanders campaign and joined the exploding Democratic Socialists
of America, whose members receive shabby business cards proclaiming them
an "official socialist organizer." [Today's **organizers** --- **not
activists**]{.underline}, thank you --- make clear that they [are
**not**]{.underline} black bloc participants [**brawling with police**
or **hippies plotting a love-in**. They are inspired by a **tradition of
professional revolutionaries**, by Lenin's exhortation that "unless the
masses are **organized**, the proletariat is **nothing**.
Organized --- it is **everything**." Organizing]{.underline}, in other
words, [is **unembarrassed about power**. It recognizes that to wield it
you need to **persuade untold numbers** of people to **join a cause**,
and to **begin organizing themselves**. Organizing means **being in it
to win**.]{.underline}

[But how do you win?]{.underline} Historical materialism holds that
**[crises]{.underline}** of capitalism [**spark revolts**, perhaps even
**revolutions**, as witnessed in the eruption of **Occupy** and **Black
Lives Matter**; uprisings in **Spain**, **Greece**, and **Egypt**; and
the **British student movement**]{.underline} against tuition fees. [But
there's **no guide for what happens** in the **long aftermath**, as the
left has **often learned the hard way**.]{.underline}

In previous moments of upheaval and promise the left has often turned to
Antonio Gramsci, who sought to understand why working-class revolts in
Europe following the Russian Revolution had led to fascism. Gramsci
concluded that on some level people consent to subservience, even take
it for granted, when the order in which they live comes to seem like
common sense. Hegemony was subtler than outright coercion, more
pervasive, permeating the tempos of daily life.

It was hegemony, Stuart Hall argued in 1983, that was key to
understanding the disappointment of his own generation --- why Thatcher
and the new right had triumphed in remaking common sense after a decade
of labor union revolt. Hegemony shaped how people acted when they
weren't thinking about it, what they thought was right and wrong, what
they imagined the good life to be. A hegemonic project had to "occupy
each and every front" of life, "to insert itself into the pores of the
practical consciousness of human beings." Thatcherism had understood
this better than the left. It had "entered the struggle on every single
front on which it calculated it could advance itself," put forth a
"theory for every single arena of human life," from economics to
language, morality to culture. The domains the left dismissed as
bourgeois were simply the ones where the ruling class was winning. Yet
creating hegemony was "difficult work," Hall reminded us. Never fully
settled, "it always has to be won."

In other words, [there is **no**]{.underline} economic [**deus ex
machina** that will **bring the revolution**. There are still
**people**, in their **stubborn**, **contradictory particularities**, as
they exist in **concrete space** and **time**. It is **up to you** to
figure out how to **act together**, or **not**; how to **find common
ground**, or **not**]{.underline}. Gramsci and Hall insist that [you
must **look relentlessly at things** and **people as they are**, **face
your prospects with brutal honesty**, and **act in ways that you think
can have an effect**]{.underline}. In these ways they are an organizer's
theorists.

BUT IN FACT, one doesn't become an organizer by reading theory, or at
least I didn't. I went to graduate school to study political theory, in
hopes of figuring out what to do about the dilemmas that weighed on me.
But it took something else to give that theory meaning in my own life.
This was the experience of graduate school, which wasn't necessarily
your typical workplace --- so the Yale administration kept telling us.

I'd joined the union as a matter of course, stopping by the Graduate
Employees and Students Organization (GESO) table at the extracurriculars
fair before I'd gone to a single day of class. Politically, it seemed
obvious: I supported unions in general, so why not join? Plus my college
roommate had been at Yale and organizing for years already: I'd heard
from him of struggles and triumphs, of how he'd knocked doors all summer
to help a slate of union members and supporters take over city
government the year prior. A few days after I signed my card, I went to
a union pizza lunch in my department to welcome our new cohort --- I was
one of just three people who'd showed up, out of seventeen --- and
nodded along with the organizer's rap about why the union was good. I
didn't need convincing.

Yet when another organizer asked me to join the union communications
team a few weeks later, I burst into tears. I was already completely
overwhelmed with hundreds of pages of reading I couldn't possibly hope
to complete, response papers to write and presentations to give on said
reading, obligatory departmental workshops and talks to attend. Doing
one more thing seemed impossible. She talked me down from panic and I
agreed to do something small --- an interview with a union member for a
newsletter we hoped to revive. I took on a series of other
projects --- more interviews, filming testimonials for a new website. At
the end of our first year, my closest friend in my graduate cohort ran
for a municipal office on the union slate, and I spent the summer
knocking doors for his campaign. I met up with other organizers for
"visits," where we walked around campus looking for members to sign
whatever petition we were running at the time, and joined my
department's organizing committee. I cried in many more meetings.

Graduate school, I came to realize, was not the place to go to learn
about politics. I was bewildered by its rituals, which
counterintuitively seemed structured around avoiding intellectual
conversation in favor of gossip and shoptalk. At house parties and
department receptions, we rarely talked about the things we'd read or
thought about; instead we complained about how many papers we'd written
that week, how many deadlines loomed for funding applications or summer
programs, how little sleep we'd gotten. We tiptoed around more sensitive
conversations: access to mental-health care, caring for children on a
stipend, the cratering job market and growing pool of adjunct labor. I
was desperate for those conversations, and organizing, I found, was the
way to have them. Like a consciousness-raising group, organizing
conversations allowed you to air grievances long suppressed in the name
of politeness or professionalism, to create a space for politics where
it wasn't supposed to be. The point was to locate the fundamental
experience of powerlessness lurking beneath the generalized misery. Yet
for all that we griped about how much we worked, in organizing
conversations the question of whether we were really workers came up
constantly.

Why was it so hard to see ourselves as people who might need a union?
Gramsci had observed that any individual's personality was "strangely
composite," made up of a mixture of beliefs, thoughts, and ideas gleaned
from family history, cultural norms, and formal education, filtered
through their own life experiences read through the prevailing ideology
of the time. Hall had taken this up to argue that when the working class
failed to espouse revolutionary thought, women to embrace feminism, or
people of color to advocate antiracism, it wasn't because they suffered
from false consciousness. The idea that consciousness could be true or
false simply made no sense: it was always, Hall stated, "complex,
fragmentary, and contradictory." This was just as true for those on the
left as for anyone else. "A tiny bit of all of us is also somewhere
inside the Thatcherite project," Hall had warned in 1988. "Of course,
we're all one hundred per cent committed. But every now and
then --- Saturday mornings, perhaps, just before the demonstration---we
go to Sainsbury's and we're just a tiny bit of a Thatcherite subject."

The Thatcherite project was since then much advanced, and we had
internalized its dictates. For our whole lives we had learned to do
school very well; in graduate school we learned to exploit ourselves on
weekends and vacations before putting ourselves "on the market." Many of
us still believed in meritocracy, despite learning every day how it was
failing us. The worse the conditions of academic life became, the harder
everyone worked, and the harder it became to contest them. Plus, we were
so lucky to be there --- at Yale! Compared to so many grad students, we
had it good, and surely jobs were waiting on the other side for us, if
for anyone. Who were we to complain? Organizing a union of graduate
students at Yale seemed to many like an act of unbearable
privilege --- a bunch of Ivy League self-styled radicals doing worker
cosplay.

Then there was the prevailing ideology. Many people liked unions in the
abstract, for other people, but had reservations about whether one made
sense for us. We worked independently for the most part (getting paid to
read!); we exercised control over our own work --- or at least hoped to
one day. Nearly all of us had grown up hearing about how bad teachers'
unions were for our own precious educations. Few of us came from union
families; almost no one had belonged to a union before, and those who
had sometimes cited bad experiences. Even among those who were nominally
sympathetic, "I think unions are good, but . . . " was a common refrain.

The really controversial thing, though, wasn't joining the union but
organizing it. We asked people to help build the union, and to help lead
it. We asked them to sign a card, then to ask a friend to sign one, too;
to commit to meeting regularly with an organizer; to join the organizing
committee and bring the people they knew to meetings and to rallies. We
asked a lot --- too much, some thought. Many people were happy to sign a
membership card and a petition from time to time but didn't want to go
to more meetings or talk to colleagues about the union: they were
already busy, so busy. They supported the union, they said, but they
wanted it to leave them alone.

This seemed like a distinctive challenge of organizing graduate
students, who on the one hand were notoriously overworked and never
really off the clock, and on the other were not quite immiserated, at
least at Yale. (In fact, this was partly because the university had
increased graduate stipends and benefits over the years in order to
undercut the union; it was the price of success.) Yet I came to think it
was part of the challenge of organizing more generally.
[Reading]{.underline} Charles Payne's I've Got the Light of Freedom,
[about **civil rights organizing** in the **Jim Crow South**, I was
struck by the list compiled by]{.underline} Student Nonviolent
Coordinating Committee (**[SNCC]{.underline}**) [**canvassers** of
reasons black Mississippians gave for not wanting to register to vote in
the early 1960s]{.underline}, which could by and large have been given
by grad students: ["Just not interested." "Don't have the time to
discuss voting." "Feel the politicians are going to do whatever they
want, regardless of votes cast." "Too busy, engaged in personal
affairs." "Wants time to think it over." "Satisfied with things as they
are."]{.underline}

[We **were not**]{.underline}, of course, **[fighting Jim
Crow]{.underline}**. Yale was miserable and feudal in many respects, but
we were there temporarily and by choice; [many of us]{.underline} feared
our advisers but **[did not fear for our lives]{.underline}**. We might
give the same excuses, but they didn't mean the same things. [Still,
**certain dynamics** of the two organizing campaigns were **similar**,
despite the **obvious differences**. People **often told you** why they
**weren't going to do something**, often with **perfectly good
reasons**, and you **tried to convince them that they
should**]{.underline}.

We were all too busy, but the too-busyness wasn't really about time, or
at least not only. Being too busy meant people didn't see why the union
was worth making time for. [Your **job as an organizer** was to **find
out what it was that people wanted to be different** in their lives, and
then to **persuade people that it mattered whether they decided to do
something about it**. This is **not the same thing** as persuading
people that the **thing itself matters**: they **usually know it does**.
The **task** is to **persuade people that they matter**: they **know
they usually don't**]{.underline}.

"THE BEGINNER WHO has learned a new language always translates it back
into his mother tongue," Marx observed in The Eighteenth Brumaire of
Louis Bonaparte, "but he assimilates the spirit of the new language and
expresses himself freely in it only when he moves in it without
recalling the old and when he forgets his native tongue." [Organizing
requires you to **learn the language of politics so well** that it
**becomes your own**. Like any other language, it takes a **lot of
practice**, during which time you **often feel awkward** and
**unsure**]{.underline}. For [this stage]{.underline} there are
exercises like "stake, take, do," which [lays out a **sequence of
questions** for you: **What is at stake for you?** **What will it take
to win?** **What will you do about it?** **You have to start with what
matters to you** and the **person you're organizing before jumping into
how hard it's going to be** and **why they should do it anyway**. These
exercises are **useful**, but they can be **stiff** and **artificial**,
because you're **not really speaking politics yet**: you're still
**translating**]{.underline}. It's why new organizers often sound
slightly robotic, repeating something they've clearly learned from
someone else. But [eventually you learn to **leave this scaffolding
behind** and **speak as yourself**]{.underline}.

[Often]{.underline}, however, [you have to learn to speak
**differently** --- to speak as a **different version of yourself**.
This means **discarding** many of your **most familiar
habits**]{.underline}. Like many women, for a while I managed to get by
on likability; I was already good at a certain kind of emotional labor.
But as the asks got bigger, I hit a wall: people might spend thirty
seconds signing a petition they didn't think mattered much because they
liked me, but they weren't going to piss off their boss just to stay in
my good graces. So I had to learn something else. "An axiom of
organizers," writes Jane McAlevey, "is that every good organizing
conversation makes everyone at least a little uncomfortable." The most
awkward part is what McAlevey calls "the long uncomfortable
silence" --- the moment when you make an ask and let someone think about
their answer. For a long time my biggest weakness was my tendency to shy
away from making sure people knew that winning the things they said they
wanted was up to them. [Too often I tried to **gloss over the
discomfort** instead of **letting it sit**. It was **a lot easier** to
talk about our **brilliant plan** or **how much support we had from our
allies** than to insist with the people I was organizing that **whether
we won**]{.underline} our own union **[or not depended on
them]{.underline}**. As a result, people saw me as the union person who
would deliver information and lay out a plan and keep them posted; they
did not see themselves as union people who were also responsible for
helping to win the things they said they wanted. McAlevey would call
this a shortcut; [we called it **protecting people from the
organizing**. To **soften the ask** seems **compassionate**, but **like
any other protective measure**, it **condescends**, and **like any other
shortcut**, it **makes things harder in the long run**]{.underline}.

Realizing that it was not enough for people to like me was revelatory.
[I had to **learn to be more comfortable with antagonism** and
**disagreement**, with **putting a choice in front of people** and
**letting them make it** instead of **smiling away tension** and **doing
the work myself**]{.underline}. I had to expect more from other people.
[**With other organizers**, **I role-played the conversations I feared
most before having them**; **afterward**, **I replayed them over** and
**over in my head**. I struggled to be]{.underline} different: the
version of myself I wanted to be, [someone who could **move people** and
**bend at least some tiny corner of the universe**.]{.underline}

[It's **not easy** to be the site of a battle for hegemony]{.underline}.
It's not a beatific Whitmanesque "I contain multitudes"; [it's an
**often painful struggle** among your competing selves for dominance.
You have **one body** and **twenty-four hours** in a day. An organizer
asks **what you'll do with them**, **concretely**, **now**. You **may
not like your own answer**]{.underline}. Your inner Thatcherite will
raise its voice. You can't kill it off entirely; you will almost
certainly find that it's a bigger part of you than you thought. [But
organizing **burrows into the pores** of your practical consciousness
and asks you to choose the part of yourself that **wants something other
than common sense**. It's **unsettling**. It can be **alienating**. And
yet I also often felt I was **finally reconciling** parts of myself I'd
tried to keep separate --- what I thought, what I said, what I did. To
organize, and to be organized, you have to keep in mind]{.underline}
Hall's lesson: [there is **no true** or **false consciousness**, **no
true self that organizing discovers** or **undoes**. You
too]{.underline}, Hall reminds us, [were made by this world you hope to
change. The **more distant** the world you want to live in is from the
world that exists, the **more deeply** you yourself will feel this
disjuncture. "**I'm not cut out for this**," people **often say** when
they struggle with organizing. **No one is**: one **isn't born an
organizer**, but **becomes one**]{.underline}.

THE SOBER, UNSEXY character of organizing is often reromanticized in
paeans to the "real work." Organizing's defenders are the most likely to
insist that it is boring. For a generation maligned as flighty and
self-absorbed, the mundanity and dullness signify authenticity, like
political normcore. Organizing signals heroic commitment rather than
faddish dilettantism, a noble resolve to do something in real life
rather than trade memes in Facebook groups or dunk on Twitter enemies.
It's true that [organizing is the **day-to-day work** of
politics --- what Ella Baker called "**spadework**," the **hard labor
that prepares the ground for dramatic action**. But I've **never
understood** the charge of **mundanity**]{.underline}. Canvassing on a
slow day can be tedious, but [**no other part** of organizing has **ever
felt dull**]{.underline} to me. [**Quite the opposite**: **nothing has
ever felt more thrilling** or **more wrenching**. Nothing has **ever
been harder to do**, or **harder to stop thinking about**]{.underline}.

In The Romance of American Communism, Vivian Gornick tells a story I
think about often, about a young woman tasked with selling the Communist
Party newsletter The Daily Worker. "My God! How I hated selling the
Worker!" she recalls. "I used to stand in front of the neighborhood
movie on a Saturday night with sickness and terror in my heart,
thrusting the paper at people who'd turn away from me or push me or even
spit in my face. I dreaded it. Every week of my life for years I dreaded
Saturday night. . . . God, I felt annihilated. But I did it, I did it. I
did it because if I didn't do it, I couldn't face my comrades the next
day. And we all did it for the same reason: we were accountable to each
other."

No one ever spat in my face, but the rest I recognize. Though I didn't
always dread organizing, I often woke up with a pit in my stomach,
thinking of the phone calls I'd have to make that day and the people I
was supposed to catch in the hallway after class. If anything, it was
worse: the people I was talking to weren't strangers on the street, but
friends and colleagues. It hurt when they stopped picking up the phone
or looked away in the halls. Why on earth did I keep doing it?

Why did anyone? Because of their political beliefs? Maybe at first --- I
didn't want to be an armchair revolutionary. But sheer ideological
conviction is rarely a predictor of someone's organizing stamina. More
importantly: because your father was in a union, or --- more
likely --- your mother needed to be; because your friend needed child
care or you needed a therapist. These things genuinely mattered. But at
some point you took a leap into excess. Was I really organizing forty
hours a week because I wanted dental? At the rate we were going, I was
unlikely to see any of the benefits anyway.

If much of my daily struggle was against the experience of grad school
itself, I had also been looking for something like the union for a long
time. I had ended up at the community-organizing nonprofit all those
years prior after a few months spent volunteering with an anarchist
collective in the ruins of New Orleans after Katrina, frustrated with
the limits of mutual aid in the face of total state breakdown, and had
been grasping for some kind of political activity that was both
transformative and pragmatic ever since. Organizing was all about that
dialectic. The union connected our demands --- which were real but not
exactly world-historical --- to the long history of labor struggles,
contemporary efforts to rebuild worker power, visions of a radically
different future that we could play a role in bringing about.

So we demanded bread and butter, but we were ultimately organizing for
the future of academic life, which was visibly crumbling around us; or
for the revival of the labor movement, which had mostly already
crumbled; or because it was intolerable to live in a city as segregated
as New Haven and not do something about it. That our union had been
organizing for three decades was both motivating and burdensome. We knew
the past triumphs and failures, attachments and wounds; we inherited
hope and melancholy. In this, it was not unlike the broader left: so
much history, so much struggle --- sometimes too much. We knew we had
tuition waivers and stipends and health care because of the union;
still, the fact that no one yet had won the whole thing in the end could
be sobering. Why would we be the ones to succeed where so many others
had failed? But it was also comforting: as there was GESO before us, so
there would be GESO after. The campaign to unionize US Steel had taken
nearly fifty years; more recently, Smithfield Foods had taken
twenty-four.

Sometimes I felt I was organizing for the future of the entire world, in
a deductive train that went: capitalism was going to devastate the
planet; to fight it we needed strong unions, which meant new organizing,
particularly in low-carbon fields like teaching, which meant building
the academic labor movement --- which meant that I needed to unionize
the Yale political science department. It was absurd. Could I have been
more quixotic, more grandiose, more self-important? Our style of
organizing was intense, often all-consuming, and I knew that, too. I
didn't always like it. Often I longed for a nice life, an easy life, the
life of the mind that academics were supposed to have. Couldn't I just
go to demonstrations here and there on the weekends before stopping off
for groceries, the way I had before?

But that hadn't worked. And the gap between the smallness of everything
I could realistically do and the largeness of everything I wanted to
happen was so immense. I was deeply pessimistic, intellectually. The
time in which to transform the global economy in order to prevent untold
death and destruction shrank daily, and the forces of reaction grew
stronger just as fast. So I wanted to do something ambitious and hard:
something commensurate with the monstrosity of the world, with the
distance of utopia and the nearness of catastrophe. There was so much I
wanted to change, so many people I wanted to move. In the daily struggle
to build the union and beat the boss and the odds, I saw something I
desperately wanted to learn.

[THE RELATIONALITY of organizing is maybe the **hardest thing to
understand**]{.underline} before you've done it. [But it is the **most
important**]{.underline}. This is not because people are governed by
emotions instead of reason, though they sometimes are. It's because [the
**entire problem** of collective action is that it's **rational to act
collectively** where it's **not to act alone**. And you build the
collective **piece** by **piece**]{.underline}.

[Organizing relationships can be **utopian**: at their **best**, they
offer the **feminist dream** of **intimacy outside of romance** or
**family**]{.underline}. In the union, I loved people I did not know
very well. In meetings I was often overcome with awe and affection at
the courage and wisdom of the people there with me. I came to count many
of the people I organized with as my dearest friends. When I needed
help, there were always people I could call, people who would always
pick up the phone, people I could and did talk to about anything. [These
relationships often served as a **source of care** and **support** in a
world with **too little of those things**. But they were not only
**friendships**, and not only **emotional ballast**. The]{.underline}
people I looked to for support would also push me when it was called
for, as I would them; that, I knew, was the deal.

Our [relationships **forged the practical commitments** to one another
that]{.underline} held the union together. They [**made us accountable**
to each other]{.underline}. They were difficult and multifaceted, often
frustrating, intensely vulnerable, and potentially transformative but no
less prone than any other relationship to carelessness, hurt, and
betrayal, and always a lot of work. [We were constantly building them
and testing their limits, pushing each other harder the closer we
got]{.underline}. They had to bear a lot of weight. In more abject
moments, I wondered whether they were anything more than instrumental.
More often, though, I wondered what was so menacing about usefulness
that it threatened to contaminate all else.

The word comrade, Jodi Dean argues, names a political relationship, not
a personal one: you are someone's comrade not because you like them but
because you are on the same side of a struggle. Comrades are not
neighbors, citizens, or friends; nor are they any kind of family, though
you might call them brother or sister. The comrade has no race, gender,
or nation. (As one meme goes: "My favorite gender-neutral pronoun is
comrade.") Comrades are not even unique individuals; they are "multiple,
replaceable, fungible." You can be comrades with millions of people you
have never met and never will. Your relationship is ultimately with the
political project you have in common. To many noncommunists, Dean
readily admits, this instrumentalism is "horrifying": a confirmation
that communism means submitting to the Borg. But the sameness of the
comrade is a kind of genuine equality.

Being an organizer is like being a comrade in some ways but different in
others. [The people you organize alongside **may be comrades**, but the
people you are organizing **often aren't**; the **point of organizing**,
after all, is to **reach beyond** the people who are **already on your
side** and **win over as many others as you can**. So you **can't
assume** the people you organize **share your values**; in fact, you
should **usually assume they don't**. This means that unlike comrades,
organizers **aren't interchangeable**. **It matters who you
are**]{.underline}. McAlevey's theory of the organic leader is that
people have to be organized by people they know and trust, not by
strangers who claim to have the right ideas. The SNCC looked for "strong
people" --- not necessarily traditional leaders, but people who were
respected and trusted among their peers, on the logic that people would
only take risky political action alongside people they trusted. When
organizers reflect the people they organize, they win: when women of
color organize other women of color, a 2007 paper by Kate Bronfenbrenner
and Dorian Warren shows, they win almost 90 percent of elections. This
cuts both ways: when women and people of color led the organizing in my
department, we often struggled to get white men to take us seriously.

Yet [the comradely element of organizing can also **open up space for
building relationships** with people beyond those boundaries. It's **not
that class** and **race** and **gender disappear**, **transcended by the
cause** --- but the **need to work together to achieve a shared end**
provides a **baseline of commonality** that makes it possible to
**relate across difference**]{.underline} and essential [to **figure out
how**. That's why you **meet people one-on-one** and **talk about what
you both care about**]{.underline}, why you open up to someone you only
know as a colleague or share with a stranger things you hardly even
discuss with your friends. It's why I cried about the humiliation of the
grad-school pecking order with my organizer when I wouldn't admit to
anyone else that I was struggling. [One-on-ones are **countercultural**:
the conversations you have in them **challenge your default
expectations** of who you can relate to, **force you outside** of the
**demographic categories** that organize most of your life and the
**scripts you've learned** for interacting with people accordingly. You
**build trust** with people you have **no prior reason to trust** not
simply by **affirming your commitment** to the shared
project]{.underline}, your devotion to the Borg, [but by **coming to
understand what brought someone else to it**]{.underline}.

### Brescia---Creative Lawyering

#### Creative lawyering: The skills of [creative legal problem solving]{.underline} and [iterative design thinking]{.underline} that debate inculcates are [essential responses]{.underline} to [multiple global threats]{.underline}. Our model teaches students the [skills to succeed as social change lawyers]{.underline}, but we [don't need to win]{.underline} everyone goes to law school because learning how the law intersects with activism and society is relevant for [everyone]{.underline}.

**Brescia, 19**---Hon. Harold R. Tyler Chair in Law and Technology,
Albany Law School (Raymond, "CREATIVE LAWYERING FOR SOCIAL CHANGE,"
Forthcoming: Volume 35, GEORGIA STATE LAW REVIEW (2019), dml)

Whether evidenced by the election of Donald J. Trump to the U.S.
presidency, the Brexit vote in Great Britain, the Women's Marches, or
advocacy on behalf of stricter gun laws in the wake of the school
shooting in Parkland, FL, [there appears to be a **clamoring**, on the
**right** and the **left**, for **social change**]{.underline}.1 Many of
these efforts are organized at the grassroots, organically, and some are
orchestrated by wealthy donors.2 Whether organic or orchestrated, [many
participating in such efforts are **dissatisfied with the status quo**
and seek social change, regardless of their political
perspective]{.underline}. 3 When people seek social change, they often
see a problem before them that they want solved, whether it is to end
gender-based, work-place harassment and sexual violence,4 or relieving
corporations of what are perceived as burdensome, "job-killing"
regulations.5 In what Gillian Hadfield calls a "law-thick world,"6 in
order to address such problems, [the solutions often involve **some
change to the legal infrastructure** that addresses the social issue
advocates seek to affect when they pursue social change]{.underline}. 7
And [in order to affect such social change, **creativity** in finding
solutions is often a **critical feature of any effort** to change that
**legal** or **regulatory infrastructure**]{.underline}. [In addition to
the **conscious efforts** of individuals, groups, and corporations to
effectuate social change, through **legal** and **policy
advocacy**]{.underline}, campaign donations, [and **community
mobilization**, social change is also happening, whether it is **driven
by forces** that may have **humans at the center** of them]{.underline},
like commercial ventures that produce technological change,8 [or
occurring **despite the best efforts** by some to **curtail them**, like
**climate change**]{.underline} as a product of human activity that sets
natural forces and responses in motion.9 [Whether humans cause such
problems **directly**]{.underline}, and with intention, [or only
**indirectly**, and **unintentionally**, [human agency is **central** to
address]{.mark} the **range of [problems the world faces]{.mark}** at
present]{.underline}.10 [Given the **complexity** of such problems,
**creativity is needed** to craft solutions]{.underline}.11 What is
more, [[the **curation of legal**, **policy**, and **regulatory
solutions**]{.mark} to these problems [will]{.mark} **likely [be at the
center]{.mark}** of efforts to address them, [whether]{.mark} they
involve **[building up]{.mark}** and **[increasing]{.mark}**,
[or]{.mark} **taking away** [and **reducing**, the **size** and
**scope** of the]{.mark} [**legal**, **policy**, and **regulatory
infrastructure**]{.mark} that addresses such problems. If
**[creative]{.mark} problem solving** is a **necessary element** of
social change now and in the future, and a **core element** of such
problem solving will require **legal**, **policy**, and **regulatory
responses** to these problems, [**lawyers** will be **at the
center**]{.mark} of social change for the **foreseeable
future**]{.underline}.12 [Given the complexity of the problems and the
need for creative solutions to address them, it will not be just any
lawyers at the center of this change, but, rather, creative
ones]{.underline}. If this is the case, can we identify the elements of
creative lawyering for social change so that we might understand what it
will take to prepare and train lawyers to assume their proper role in
efforts to bring about such change? This Article is an attempt to
identify these elements by a review of three moments in American social
and political history when lawyers played a critical role in crafting
creative solutions to thorny social problems.

The lawyers I will choose to highlight in this review include several
lawyers involved in the effort to end slavery in the United States,
those engaged in the legal fight to dismantle the Jim Crow system in the
South in the mid-20th century, and the recent effort to bring about
marriage equality for the LGBTQ community. While the lawyers in these
moments were not the sole actors in the social change effort that
unfolded in these particular points in history, nor were they even the
main drivers of the campaign to end slavery, nevertheless, in all three
examples, the lawyers I will highlight played key roles in helping to
craft not just our understanding of these problems but also creative
responses to them.13 In at least the last two examples, the **[creative
lawyers]{.underline}** I will highlight helped to [lead the legal
struggle to **reconstruct an edifice of inclusion** and **equality** and
**solve dramatic legal inequalities** with an ultimate goal of
**rectifying broader**, **societal inequalities**]{.underline}. The hope
is that [this]{.underline} review [can help **unearth lessons from past
instances** when lawyers **used creativity** to advance social change,
particularly social change that **had a legal component at its center**,
to help **inform efforts in the present** and **future** to effect
similar social change]{.underline}.

With these goals in mind, this Article proceeds as follows. In Part I, I
will review the literature on creativity in the law in an effort to show
that, contrary to popular perception, there can be creativity to the
lawyer's craft generally, and I will try to review the techniques that
lawyers often use when they seek to address their clients' problems
creatively. I will also explore the ways in which social change
lawyering is different from, and can often be more complex than, more
traditional lawyering.

In Part II, I will explore three examples of instances where lawyers
played a significant role in helping to advance social change in the
hope that such an exploration will help unearth common themes regarding
the approaches these lawyers appear to have taken in advancing social
change creatively and with intention. These three examples, as
discussed, will involve the effort to end slavery in the United States,
the campaign to dismantle Jim Crow, and the effort for recognition of
same-sex marriage. I submit that these three examples offer critical
lessons about what creative lawyering for social change entails.

In Part III, I will identify what I consider to be the five common
components of these [[campaigns]{.mark} for [social
change]{.mark}]{.underline}. This review suggests that these components
include, first, that the lawyers have often
**[[proceed]{.underline}]{.mark}**ing [**incrementally** and [in an
**iterative**]{.mark}, **experimental [fashion]{.mark}**. [They]{.mark}
have looked for ways [to **build support**]{.mark} **for their legal
position** [both in]{.mark} the [**courts of law** and]{.mark} in those
of [**public opinion**, seeking a **tipping point** where]{.mark} the
[solutions]{.mark} they propose **[gain]{.mark}** and **secure
[traction]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} ultimately **[create a new]{.mark}
legal [paradigm]{.mark}** around the problem]{.underline}.14 Second,
[creative lawyers advocating for social change have typically viewed the
legal problem that presented itself in a way that **others have not
viewed it**, often **taking the arguments of their adversaries**,
**coopting them**, **turning them on their heads**, **reframing them**,
and **shifting them** to the lawyers' advantage]{.underline}.15 Third,
[[creative lawyers are **humble enough** to incorporate]{.mark} the
**viewpoints** and **approaches** of [other disciplines]{.mark},
bringing **different [domains]{.mark}** into the advocacy effort in
order [to **strengthen**]{.mark} **their legal
[arguments]{.mark}**]{.underline}.16 Fourth, [lawyers often **seek
out**, both consciously and unconsciously]{.underline}, what the late
Derrick Bell called "Interest Convergence": [opportunities for different
sectors in society to **share a common goal** based on their
**similar**, though often **different**, **particular
interests**.]{.underline}17 Fifth, creative lawyers for social change
often recognize that [their advocacy **does not appear in a vacuum**: it
is **dependent on** and occurs **simultaneously** with changes occurring
in broader society]{.underline}.18 In these ways, it is interdependent
with larger social forces and [the creative lawyer must take them into
account]{.underline} when she engages [in efforts to bring about social
change]{.underline}.

The final section, Part IV, will explore the implications of this
taxonomy of creative social change lawyering and attempts to chart a
path forward for those who might want to bring creativity to such an
endeavor, either because they are currently lawyers advocating for
social change, they are current law students or law faculty, or even
those who are simply contemplating going to law school. It tries to
spark a discussion about the proper role of creativity in lawyering at
this time of great social ferment, when many seek to advance social
change and to alter the legal landscape in order to address what they
see as societal ills.

I. CREATIVE PROBLEM SOLVING AND THE LAW

A. Lawyering as Creative Problem Solving

[[The **world's**]{.mark} **natural [resources are under
threat]{.mark}** and the ability to **feed a growing global population
faces serious challenges** [due to]{.mark} the **specter of
[drought]{.mark}**, the **[inundation of farmlands]{.mark}**, the
[**erosion of top soil**, and]{.mark} other problems caused by
**[climate change]{.mark}**]{.underline}.19 [**Armed [conflict]{.mark}**
[in the **Middle East** and **Africa**]{.mark}]{.underline},20
**[political unrest in [South]{.mark} America]{.underline}**,21
[[and]{.mark} **criminal terror in [Central America]{.mark}** have
[created a]{.mark} **global [refugee
crisis]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark}22 [The rise of
[**authoritarianism** and]{.mark} a hard-edged form of **conservative
[populism]{.mark}** [threaten the **rule of
law**]{.mark}]{.underline}.23 A threat to the rule of law, in turn, is a
challenge for economic growth, as fairness, consistency, and
predictability in governance is directly correlated with the economic
health of a nation as well as its long-term survival.24 [**Rapid
technological change**, which is a product of compounding technological
innovation, is already **remaking society** and is likely to have
**dramatic effects** on social and economic relations for
generations]{.underline}.25 [Whether it is **[a]{.mark}utonomous
[v]{.mark}ehicle[s]{.mark}**, [the **I**]{.mark}**nternet [o]{.mark}f
[T]{.mark}hings**, or [**Big Data** and **a**]{.mark}**rtificial
[i]{.mark}ntelligence**, the **rapid increase in computing power** that
has been unleashed [could **address some**]{.mark} **of the world's
[problems]{.mark}**]{.underline}, like pedestrian, passenger, and driver
deaths from automobiles,26 [[but]{.mark} has also **[create]{.mark}d
[new ones]{.mark}**[, like **privacy breaches**,
**cyber-security**,]{.mark} and the threat of [a
**drone**]{.mark}]{.underline} or unmanned vehicle [[delivering]{.mark}
a **dirty bomb** or, worse, [a **nuclear payload**]{.mark}, from a
remote location on the other side of the planet]{.underline}.27 [Rapid
technological change has also **remade the economic landscape**,
[and]{.mark} stands to alter the relationship of many workers to their
employers]{.underline}, a shift we are already seeing in the sharing
economy.28 [Whether it is **complete displacement from
[automation]{.mark}**, or a **shift** from regular employment to
sporadic, contract, "on demand" work, the relationship of many of the
world's workers]{.underline}, in such diverse fields as truck transport,
manufacturing, and even the law, [are likely to see **dramatic changes**
to the ways in which they relate to their employer and earn a living
over the coming decades]{.underline}.29 Furthermore, as the evidence of
the use of modern technologies like the internet and social media to
undermine elections in several democratic nations is overwhelming, it is
apparent that [sometimes the forces]{.underline} described above, [like
**authoritarianism**, **technological change**, and threats to the
**rule of law**, **compound** each other]{.underline}, as technological
advances can support efforts to undermine the rule of law, exacerbating
the threats to stability and democracy.30 Similarly, technological
change is having a dramatic impact on economic well-being across the
world, creating vast wealth for a few and increasing inequality in some
nations.31 [[These]{.mark} problems [are]{.mark} all [**crying out for a
solution**; and lawyers are in the **problem solving
business**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

For Gerald Lopez, "**[Lawyering means problem-solving]{.underline}**."32
Similarly, for Carrie Menkel-Meadow a lawyer is a "professional with
formal legal training who employs law, as well as other relevant
disciplines, to solve human problems and disputes, plan transactions,
prepare legal instruments and regulations."33 Lawyers often find
themselves in the "problem space" where they must either find solutions,
or, in order to advance a client's interests, make situations more
complex or difficult.34 According to Gary Blasi: "At bottom, lawyering
entails solving (or making worse) problems of clients and others, under
conditions of extraordinary complexity and uncertainty, in a virtually
infinite range of settings."35 The American Bar Association describes
problem solving and legal analysis as the two "conceptual foundations
for virtually all aspects of legal practice."36 But [lawyers do **more**
than bring **mere technical skill** to this problem space]{.underline}.
As Paul Brest argues, [a lawyer must certainly utilize]{.underline} her
[**legal training** and **judgment** to address a]{.underline} client's
[problem]{.underline}, she [must also understand]{.underline} the
[**other constraints**---like]{.underline} the [**political setting**
or]{.underline} the **[economic capacity]{.underline}** with which a
client operates---that bound that client's actions.37 Indeed, as he and
Linda Hamilton Krieger explain: "[[finding the **best
solution**]{.underline}]{.mark}---a solution that addresses all of the
client's concerns---[usually [requires **more** than technical legal
skill]{.mark}]{.underline}[."]{.mark}38 Lawyers thus solve client
problems that have a legal component to them, taking into account a
range of interests and needs, in the pursuit of solutions that address
those needs.39

But what role does creativity play in lawyering and problem solving?
According to Shultz and Zedeck, [[creativity is]{.mark} one of the
**[core]{.mark}**]{.underline} lawyering **[skills]{.underline}** they
have identified as [**essential** to contemporary law
practice]{.underline}.40 [[Legal problem solving]{.mark} tends to
**require some degree of creativity**, [**regardless** of the]{.mark}
**nature** of the [work]{.mark} involved]{.underline}.41 When engaging
in creative problem solving, Menkel-Meadow argues that [the lawyer uses
**analogy** and **metaphor**, **draws lessons** and **insights** from
other fields, "[extend\[s\]]{.mark} a **line of [reasoning]{.mark}**,
**principle** or **solution** beyond its original purpose",
**[challenges]{.mark} conventional [assumptions]{.mark}**,
**[deploys]{.mark} narrative**, and **reframes problems** by looking at
them from **different perspectives**]{.underline}.42 Another way to
think about [these approaches]{.underline} is that they
[represent]{.underline} what is sometimes called ["**[lateral
thinking]{.mark}**"; moving **beyond purely linear**, **analytical
thought**; and **shifting mental paradigms**]{.underline}.43 Similar to
Menkel-Meadow, Linda Morton has identified the characteristics of
creative problem solving in the law as including a focus on the
"underlying needs and interests . . . of individuals as well as
society;" an analysis of the values at stake in a situation, including
those of an individual but also "society as a whole;" the use of
interdisciplinary resources; a focus on problem prevention; and
"self-reflection and analysis."44

B. Problem Solving and the Social Change Lawyering

While the problem-solving work of lawyers often involves creativity,
particularly when she is asked to solve complex problems, the lawyer who
works for social change---however she defines that change---faces unique
challenges that add another layer, or layers, of complexity to the
lawyer's work and the choices she must make.45 Social change lawyers
certainly must bring creativity to their work to solve the complex
problems they are often asked to solve, or take it upon themselves to
solve, but the role they assume when seeking to address social problems
takes on new dimensions beyond that which the traditional lawyer must
address.

1\. Social Change Lawyers Work to Change the System.

The most important difference between a social change lawyer and a
traditional lawyer is that the social change lawyer is generally working
to change the legal infrastructure affecting her client's life.46 The
traditional lawyer, by contrast, generally works within that
infrastructure.47 Certainly, there are situations where a traditional
lawyer might argue for a novel or creative take on a particular
precedent so as to gain an advantage for a specific client, but the
social change lawyer generally works for broader, societal change, and
the novel or creative arguments about precedent can, at times, have
tremendous impact on not just her client, but society more broadly. The
lawyers who argued Obergefell v. Hodges48 were claiming recognition of
their clients' marital relationships. A traditional lawyer might do that
when seeking recognition of spousal support on behalf of a client. But
the arguments the traditional lawyer might make are likely asking for
recognition for the client within existing definitions of marital
relations. The marriage equality lawyers were arguing, similarly, for
recognition of LGBTQ relationships using existing legal frameworks, for
sure: in fact, that was the point of the marriage equality effort.49 But
what that required was a new understanding of not just marital
relations, but also of the Equal Protection clause itself.50 This is
just one example of a situation in which the social change lawyer is
often arguing not inside the system, but seeking to change the system
itself, making her job much more complicated and challenging than that
of the traditional lawyer in many instances.51

2\. Social Change Lawyers Must Strive to Empower Their Clients and Not
Further Marginalize Them.

Not only must social change lawyers work to improve the lives of their
clients and the communities in which they live, they must also strive to
ensure that they are placing the clients out in front of the advocacy,
empowering them.52 The wave of legal advocates that emerged in the wake
of the successes of the Civil Rights Movement in the late 1960s and
early 1070s, and the work they shouldered on behalf of marginalized
groups, generated critiques of lawyer-driven advocacy.53 Some raised
concerns that such advocacy, which was often focused on such
lawyer-centric strategies like litigation, ran the risk of disempowering
grassroots groups and detracting from efforts to build grassroots
campaigns and, ultimately, grassroots power;54 moreover, some critics
argued that such lawyer-driven strategies, on their own, fail to lead to
lasting change.55 Such lasting change is difficult to achieve when
efforts to promote social change do not fundamentally attack and alter
existing power relations.56 Making matters worse, there is a threat that
advocacy that places the lawyer at the center of the work can even
further marginalize clients, typically by casting such clients as
victims, and often treating them as such, rather than recognizing the
potential of their own power as individuals and groups of individuals to
pursue and obtain selfdetermination, autonomy, and power.57 Thus, social
change lawyers should strive to put their client at the center of their
work so as not to further marginalize them. Society does that enough.
The traditional lawyer likely does not face similar challenges.

3\. Social Change Lawyers Have Different Constraints in Case Selection.

There is also a unique financial component to the lawyer-client
relationship that exists between the social change lawyer and her
clients when compared to that typically involved in the traditional
lawyer-client relationship.58 This different relationship can have
ramifications for the actions the lawyer takes, or does not take, on
behalf of her client. In the typical lawyer-client relationship in the
contemporary legal profession, the lawyer is paid on a feefor-service
basis, often at an hourly rate, and sometimes based on a flat fee
depending on the service she provides.59 Sometimes a lawyer proceeds on
a contingency-fee basis, where she bears the risk of an unsuccessful
outcome, receiving compensation only if she is successful on behalf of
her client.60 Each of these relationships hinge on the economic
relationship between the lawyer and the client; the client often makes
decisions based on an economic calculus of whether it is worth it to
proceed with the representation based on---to put it crudely---how much
justice she can afford.61 Thus, critical tactical decisions may come
down to whether the client wishes to pay for the service offered by the
lawyer.62 A client may wish to spare no expense and give the lawyer
great freedom to make tactical decisions, regardless of the cost.63 The
client may choose certain tactics based solely on a cost-benefit
calculus of the likely gains possible through the use of different
tactics and the potential outcomes and risks associated with those
tactics.64 Of course, while cost may impact the tactical choices a
lawyer might make on behalf of a client, with the decisions about those
choices made with the client's costconsciousness in mind, it is also
entirely possible that the lawyer and client may have no tactical
choices to make because the clients foregoes legal representation
altogether based on the perceived costs associated with that
representation and the likely benefits that might accrue, or, more
simply, because she cannot afford any level of service from the
lawyer.65 Indeed, many Americans face their legal problems without a
lawyer, with cost being one of the main contributing factors to their
decision to proceed, or not proceed, with representation.66 In many
ways, this is a relative easy decision. The client consults with the
lawyer, makes a decision on the likely costs and potential benefits of
representation, and decides how she would like the lawyer to proceed.67

In the social change context, the calculus is often much different.
There is certainly some small degree of overlap in the approaches
utilized by some social change lawyers and those in traditional
settings. With certain socialchange oriented fields of practice, like
employment discrimination, employee wage-and-hour rights, police
brutality actions, and social security benefits to name just a few,
social change lawyers may operate from within the private bar, charging
contingency fees for their work and taking a portion of the award they
may win on behalf of their clients or earning remuneration through
fee-shifting provisions in the statutes governing the claims.68 At the
same time, the possibility of contingency-fee arrangements often crowds
out the work of the social change lawyer, who might make strategic
decisions about the types of cases she tends to take based on whether a
particular client might have other options for representation based on
the availability of lawyers from the private bar willing to take the
client's case through a contingency-fee-based retainer.69

But in other fields, where there are few contingency-fee opportunities,
where the private bar might see the client's claim as too risky to take
(even on contingency), or where fee shifting might not be available, the
social change lawyer will typically work in a non-profit legal services
provider, whether that provider is a small, local organization that
addresses local concerns, or a large, national organization, that seeks
to promote a national agenda in a particular field.70 Indeed, the
diversity of issues non-profit lawyers address is quite large, from
animal rights and environmental justice, to claims on behalf of the
transgender community and the rights of low-wage immigrant workers.71
For lawyers not operating in fields typically dominated by paying
clients, or clients who can be served through contingency-fee
arrangements, lawyers face a different calculus when it comes to the
costs associated with providing representation.72 They must find funding
to provide the representation, and that funding might come from a
government entity, a private foundation, or a private donor.73 While the
decision to take on a case in the traditional lawyer-client relationship
may come down to whether a particular client will pay for the services
she will receive from the lawyer, in the social-change setting, the
lawyer must make a different calculation: whether the case is one that
fits within the constraints that may be imposed by the donor or the
source of funds.74 If the source is a government entity, the client must
fit within the constraints imposed by that source, which is typically a
function of the income of the client or the nature of the case.75 If the
source of the funds that might allow the representation of the client is
a private foundation or individual donor, the lawyer must ensure she
provides services consistent with the donor's intent when that donor
made the contribution to the legal organization.76

The decision to represent a particular client in a particular case is
not made simply on whether the client fits within the confines of the
constraints imposed by the sources of funds the organization receives.
While that is certainly a baseline requirement---i.e., the lawyer's
organization typically must have funding to provide the services---the
organization will also take into account other concerns when considering
whether to take on the case. In a world of scarce resources, legal
organizations may impose a sort of "lifeboat" ethics when make decisions
with respect to which cases to take.77 The degree of complexity of the
case may make it so resource intensive that the decision to accept the
case might mean that the organization is unable to accept other clients
who might also fit within the categories of cases the organization may
handle. If, for example, the lawyer were to take on a complicated
eviction case, and, even if she were to save the client's apartment,
that representation might mean that three other families go without
representation and face eviction as a result. Lawyers in these
situations must make decisions about which cases to take based on some
rubric of cost, merit, resources required, likely benefits that might
flow from the representation, and the opportunity cost associated with
rejecting other clients.78 While these decisions come down to resource
constraints and costbenefits analyses, not unlike the factors that weigh
on the client in the traditional attorney-client relationship, the
social change lawyer and the organization in which she works typically
make the decision whether to accept the case for representation. As a
result, where in the traditional lawyer-client relationship the
cost-benefit analysis is one made by the client, in the social change
context, this decision is one typically made by the lawyer and the
organization in which she works, adding a layer of complexity to the
work that is mostly not present in the traditional setting.79 A private
lawyer certainly may make the decision that, despite a client's desire
for representation, the lawyer may not take on the case, based on her
present workload or other factors.80 Such decisions do not take on the
same degree of complexity as in the social change setting. They may not
take on the same moral or social weight either. A private lawyer turning
down a paying client probably can rest assured that client will find
another lawyer to represent her; that is not always, or even often, the
case with the social change lawyer.81

Moreover, for the social change lawyer, there is often another aspect of
the decision to take on a case: whether a particular client's case
presents itself as a vehicle for furthering the lawyer's social change
goals or agenda.82 In other words, one client's case may offer the
lawyer an opportunity to advance the social change goals she wants to
pursue. The factors that go into the decision as to whether a particular
case might advance the social change the lawyer wants to see are often
quite complex, offering another degree of complexity to legal advocacy
for social change.83 For many social change lawyers, as with any
lawyers, the primary issue they must face when deciding whether they can
take a case is often, first, whether the case has merit, and, second,
whether the lawyer thinks she can win it. But whether one can win the
case is often, itself, a question involving a highly complicated
calculus, as is the case with all lawyering. For the social change
lawyer, however, even defining what a win is can be complicated.84 The
lawyer may score a moral victory, may delay an eviction or deportation,
or may apply enough political pressure on a government agency that it
decides to change a policy even when that policy is upheld by the
courts.85 Some of these same considerations may play into the
traditional lawyer's calculus, but the decision to proceed is often left
to the client in that setting. In the social change setting, the lawyer
will have to balance the interest of the client before her, the interest
of the broader community in seeing the policy challenged, and the
interests of the funders of the organization in seeing activity
consistent with the organizational goals the funder supports. These
other interests may weigh on the social change lawyer in other ways as
well, which introduces considerations the traditional lawyer does not
typically face.86

4\. Social Change Lawyers Face Different Opportunity Costs Related to
the Tradeoff between Direct Services and Law Reform Activities.

Another aspect of social change lawyering that emerges in the face of
resource constraints is that in order to pursue a longer-term legal
strategy, when resources are committed to such a strategy (toward what
is often called law reform), that necessarily means that such resources
are channeled away from direct services that might solve a particular
client's immediate problem without addressing larger social change
goals.87 While long- and short-term strategies do not need to be in
tension, they can be when an organization does not have the resources to
do both, and it must choose between law reform and other, similar
strategies, and emergency, direct, and atomized services to individual
clients.88 When members of the community the social change lawyer is
dedicated to serving face real harm in the absence of legal
interventions, social change lawyers can face a devastating choice:
prevent an eviction, defend against the loss of custody of a child, or
secure public assistance benefits on the one hand, or, on the other,
pursue strategies that might restructure the legal relationships, over
time, such that fewer members of the community face such harrowing
outcomes.89 In some ways, these choices may have become less complex for
some lawyers, because they have fewer choices to make: cutbacks to
federal funding for legal services programs and restrictions imposed on
such funding mean that lawyers in programs receiving funds from this
source are able to serve fewer clients and have fewer tactical choices
among which to choose. 90 This means both that lawyers who do not face
such restrictions have more clients from which to choose (meaning
greater complexity and choices), even as the overwhelming majority of
low-income people face their legal problems without legal assistance.91

5\. Social Change Lawyering Often Involves Complex Goals.

Putting aside the question of how resources should be deployed in the
service of social change, and whether lawyers should choose between
direct services and longer-term strategies, for the social change
lawyer, there are often other, "larger" interests she must weigh in the
decision to take on a case.92 If the cause she promotes is a goal
identified by a particular community-based organization or the expansion
of rights for a particular social or demographic group, taking on a
case, pressing certain rights, and bringing them to the attention of the
courts and the general public can sometimes undermine the long-term
interests of the cause the lawyer supports because it can spark a
backlash, a retrenchment of rights through the adoption of legislation
that undermines any victory the lawyer may achieve in the courts, either
through the acts of a hostile legislature or an electorate willing to
adopt a ballot initiative to scale back or reverse such victories.93 In
the marriage equality context, lawyers won victories in the state courts
in several states, only to have those victories undermined by
legislative action and even ballot initiatives.94 Thus, when considering
the interests of the client that presents herself for representation to
the social change lawyer, that lawyer often must balance the interests
of that client against other interests.95 Once the lawyer accepts the
case for representation, these other interests should generally factor
less in the decisions that transpire throughout the course of the
representation, however. But before the lawyer agrees to accept the
representation of the client, these issues will likely weigh heavily on
her decision to proceed or not to proceed with the case.96

6\. Social Change Lawyers Must Often Chose among a More Complex Array of
Tactics in Pursuant of Complex Goals.

If the decision is made to take on the case, another decision that the
lawyer must make in the social change setting, often in consultation
with the client, is the tactics that she will deploy in proceeding with
the representation. In the traditional attorney-client relationship,
these decisions might present themselves in a more straightforward way.
The client wants to purchase property. She wants to sue over a breach of
contract. The goals are often more discrete and more easily identifiable
in such settings. For the social change lawyer, the goal or goals she
might pursue might be more amorphous, and present more challenging
problems to solve.97 The lawyer's social change objectives might include
improving the treatment of a particular social group in society
generally or to protect a community from a particularly destructive
government or business practice. The goals, and the tactics that one
might use to achieve them, might not present themselves in so obvious a
fashion. When the goals are themselves less defined, the lawyer will
often find that the decision choosing among tactics is more complex. The
lawyer, in consultation with the client, will likely weigh the likely
costs and benefits of the different tactics that could be utilized to
achieve the overarching goals of the representation, introducing even
more complexity into the situation.98

7\. Social Change Lawyers May Find It Difficult to Identify the Client.

Another layer of complexity comes from not just defining the goals of
the representation or the tactics to be utilized to achieve them.
Indeed, social change lawyering sometimes involves some debate over even
identifying the client in each situation.99 Is the client the individual
or group who presents him-, her- or itself to the lawyer for
representation, or is the client someone or some group the lawyer has
identified as serving as a strategic partner to advance the cause the
lawyer seeks to further?100 Sometimes the social change lawyer goes out
in search of the appropriate client who may serve as a participant in
the social change strategy because that sometimes idealized and
sought-after client's situation is sympathetic or compelling, offering a
salient narrative that both illuminates the plight of those whose
situation the social change lawyer wants to improve through her advocacy
and helps present facts that might garner support from the courts,
policymakers or legislators who the lawyer may need to persuade in order
to convince them to embrace the cause and advance the social change the
lawyer is pursuing.101 This search for the client or clients that might
help fill this narrative role might mean the client in such settings may
assume a different role than one in the traditional lawyer-client
relationship.102 Contemporary legal ethics requires even the social
change lawyer to maintain a relationship with every client such that the
client controls the critical ends of the representation.103 When the
lawyer may have a different sense of who the client is in any given
situation---is it the person who is the nominal representative plaintiff
in a class action, is it the community the individual represents, is it
someone or some other entity or group---the lawyer's sense of whom she
serves may change. The social change lawyer may thus perceive that she
is entitled to have a different relationship to a specific client in a
particular matter because the social change lawyer might see a living
and breathing client as representing some larger cause or interest. This
then means the process of identifying the clients' interests and needs,
and the tactics the lawyer should pursue, becomes more complex, and the
lawyer, whether we like or not, must try to both understand who the
client is, what the client wants, and how the lawyer should proceed on
the client's behalf. But all that depends on how the lawyer defines the
client. When the client is an amorphous group like "the community," with
no clear spokesperson or constituent who can provide the guidance to the
lawyer as to the interests and preferred tactics of the client, the
process of identifying both who the client is as well as how the lawyer
should proceed becomes more challenging.104 Admittedly, for some
lawyers, they may feel that gives them license to proceed as they see
fit, substituting their sense of what that undefined, incorporeal
"client" wants; for others, the lawyer who truly wants to ensure that
she proceeds with the interests of a client or clients at the center of
what she does, that process becomes only harder, not easier.

C. What Complexity Means for Social Change Lawyers

When comparing the social change lawyer's role to that of what I have
called a traditional lawyer, it would appear that there is some greater
level of complexity that adds to the general complexity of the problem
the lawyer is attempting to address. The decision to accept or reject a
client often has different components in the social change context when
compared to that decision in the traditional, private relationship. In
fact, that identity of the client may itself shift when the lawyer is
engaged in social change lawyering; in turn, that shift in the identity
of the client means the considerations and factors a lawyer must weigh
are also different---and also more complex. So, the [additional
complexity]{.underline} often [centers around **[what clients to
accept]{.mark}** for representation; **[what strategies to
deploy]{.mark}** to achieve them; the **tactics to utilize** in pursuing
those strategies; and the **direction** the lawyer should take, and
**from whom**, when pursuing those tactics and strategies.]{.underline}
To a certain extent, some of these decisions play a role in the
traditional lawyer-client relationship, but, generally, they involve a
greater deal of complexity in the social change context. [This
complexity **[brings new dimensions]{.mark}** to problem solving in this
type of advocacy, requiring a **greater degree of creativity** from the
social change lawyer in pursuing solutions to such
problems]{.underline}.

Despite these additional considerations that lawyers working for social
change have faced when engaging in creative problem solving for their
clients (however they define those clients), [[lawyers have **long
played roles** in]{.mark} attempting to help **engineer [social
change]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The unsuccessful litigation that would
lead to the Supreme Court's decision in Plessy v. Ferguson, which
enshrined the doctrine of separate but equal, was in many ways the
product of the type of legal campaign that became commonplace by the
1970s. 105 [[The]{.mark} **prominent [role]{.mark}** that [lawyers
played in]{.mark} the **[Civil Rights]{.mark} Movement** helped to
[**serve as a model** for]{.mark} efforts of progressive lawyers that
have sought to **promote [environmental protection]{.mark}**[;
**women's**]{.mark} **rights**; the rights of **different racial** and
**ethnic groups**, like the **[Latinx]{.mark}** and
**[Asian-American]{.mark} communities**; [and **LGBTQ
rights**]{.mark}]{.underline}.106 It also prompted the rise of
conservative legal organizations that promoted a pro-business or
libertarian agenda through the courts.107

[With **some degree of urgency**, there is a **growing understanding**
that the law **must be used** to promote social justice and social
change, but there is also an **emerging appreciation** for the fact that
[there is **not just one way to use the law**]{.mark} to promote social
justice, and that those who would use the law to do so must be sensitive
to community needs. This work is thus not only **tactically flexible**,
"but also **responsive** and **accountable** to community interests and
needs."]{.underline}108 Scott Cummings describes this reemergence, with
a focus on advocates seeking to promote workers' rights, as follows:
["[\[L\]abor activists]{.underline}]{.mark} [have]{.underline}, in fact,
[begun to **leverage a broader range of legal regimes** to [advance
**multiple**]{.mark} **labor [goals]{.mark}**]{.underline}, from direct
worker mobilization to the protection and expansion of unionized
industries."109 They have done this [[by]{.mark} **filing suits**
[pressing **i**]{.mark}**nternational [h]{.mark}uman [r]{.mark}ights
[claims]{.mark}** in order to "to **mobilize immigrant
workers**,"]{.underline}110 [[brought **land use claims**]{.mark} "in an
effort to **block big-box retailers** from entering markets dominated by
unionized groceries,"]{.underline}111 [and "**[threatened]{.mark}
environmental law[suits]{.mark}**"]{.underline}112 [in order to
**strengthen their negotiating position** when seeking "community
benefit agreements with labor-friendly provisions."]{.underline}113 He
argues that this suggests that "a more fundamental reorientation is
under way within the labor movement,"114 because [activists are
adopting]{.underline} what he calls [a "**legal
pluralist**"]{.underline}115 [approach]{.underline} which recognizes the
many ways in which the law interacts with the employer-employee
relationship to "leverage the power of law to advance labor goals."116
This work is thus [a "**more politically integrated**, **tactically
versatile model** of legal practice,"]{.underline}117 [where [legal
victories are **only** "**moments in broader campaigns** to
**stimulate**]{.mark} **collective [action]{.mark}** [and
**leverage**]{.mark} **political [reform]{.mark}**"]{.underline}118 [[as
**opposed to ends**]{.mark} **in themselves**]{.underline}. As Cummings
further explains, [litigation affords advocates just "**one of many
problem solving tools**," and clients are "allies to be **educated** and
**empowered for future struggles**."]{.underline}119 Others scholars
have identified the ways in which low-wage worker legal advocacy has
embraced this accountable and tactically pluralistic approach.120

It is also evident in the housing context.121 In my own work and
research, I was a part of, and attempted to assess, the coordinated
effort to fight the radical transformation of what was two middle-class
and working poor housing developments in New York City, Peter Cooper
Village and Stuyvesant Town, into luxury housing for the very rich. That
effort, which combined community education, grassroots organizing,
direct services through brief advice and assistance and direct
representation, and an affirmative class action case, ultimately
prevented the conversion of affordable housing to unaffordable
housing.122 This was done in a tactically pluralistic way, in
collaboration with a range of community partners, including an engaged,
local elected official and a robust tenant association, as well as
non-profit lawyers and private lawyers working on contingency. That work
showed that [lawyers from **different backgrounds** and **experiences**
could bring a **range of tactics** to bear to bring about **important
social change**, or at least **prevent an erosion of
significant**]{.underline} economic **[rights]{.underline}** from
befalling the residents of these developments.123 [This required
**effective coalition building**, and the delivery of **targeted**,
**customized**, and **focused representation** and **assistance** in an
**efficient way** in order to **balance the need for direct services**
that would **prevent displacement** while bringing **tactical**,
**affirmative litigation** that would **ensure the protection of
broader**, **comprehensive rights**]{.underline} for the collective
benefit of the residents of these developments. [This tactical pluralism
**provided effective relief**, and **required creativity** both in terms
of **pulling together the different strands** of the services to be
provided as well as the **individuals** and **organizations** that would
provide them]{.underline}. The complex problem of preserving affordable
housing required innovative legal and advocacy strategies, as well as a
diverse team of stakeholders and service providers, to bring about a
successful outcome.124

The example of the work of labor rights activists and the housing
lawyers involved in the effort to defend affordable housing in New York
City show that lawyers engaged in problem solving in pursuit of social
change face additional creative challenges that add new dimensions to
their work when compared to the work of traditional lawyers. At the same
time, as the following Part shows using just three examples, though
there are many, many more from which to choose, despite these
challenges, [lawyers working for social change have **helped to bring
about dramatic change** by playing a role in **reforming the legal
institutions** that structure the relations between individuals,
communities, broader society, and the government. Lawyers have helped
**sparked meaningful change** in terms of **improving civil**,
**political**, and **human rights for countless millions** of
Americans]{.underline}. Thus, [lawyers have found ways to **confront the
complexities** associated with social change lawyering with
**creativity** and **zeal**, helping to **advance new understandings**
of the U.S. Constitution, the laws, and social relations in the United
States]{.underline}.125 Are there lessons we can learn from the examples
of such successful efforts to bring about positive social change that I
will highlight here, particularly those ways in which such efforts
involved creative solutions to solving complex social problems? In the
next section, I will use three examples of lawyers playing a role in
addressing complex social problems through legal advocacy in an effort
to identify some of the common approaches and themes of such lawyers. It
is to these examples that I now turn.

II\. LAWYERING FOR SOCIAL CHANGE

In this Part, I will describe the role that lawyers played in three
moments of significant social change in the United States: the effort to
combat slavery, the decades-long struggle for Civil Rights for African
Americans, and the campaign for marriage equality for members of the
LGBTQ community. In the first example, much larger forces played a
greater role in ultimately bringing about an end to slavery, yet lawyers
still played an important role in addressing the treatment in the law of
slaves, particularly escaped slaves, and that approach helped inform the
larger effort to end slavery. In the Civil Rights Movement and the
effort to attain marriage equality, lawyers played central roles (and at
least in the Civil Rights Movement, subsequent critiques have argued
that their role was too central).126 In each of these examples, however,
the lawyers whose work I will highlight did not operate in a vacuum. The
lawyers all were sensitive to forces playing out in the wider world,
brought in other disciplines to support their efforts, and sought to
form broad coalitions. What follows is a description of each of these
three examples of lawyers working for social change. In subsequent
Parts, I will explore some common themes that emerge from this analysis
as well as what this analysis might say about creative lawyering for
social change now and in the future.

A. Lawyers and the Abolition of Slavery in the United States

The first example to explore recounts the efforts of two lawyers who
played roles in the effort to end slavery in the United States: one
famous one and one not-so famous. Of course, lawyers had a significant
hand in crafting the laws that first enshrined slavery in the U.S.
Constitution127 and then in the many legislative compromises and
proposals that would ultimately prove unsuccessful in either maintaining
or ending slavery, with the failure of such efforts to end slavery
peaceably ultimately leading to the U.S. Civil War. One of the main
tensions between the Northern and Southern states was the Fugitive Slave
Act, which had been updated as part of the package of provisions that
would become the Compromise of 1850.128 The 1850 version of the law
required that any slave holder whose slave escaped to free state or
territory could petition federal authorities to return that slave to his
or her master.129 Riots would sometimes occur in free states when
federal authorities would move in to enforce the law, as abolitionists
would seek to protect the escaped slave from return to bondage.130

With the outbreak of the Civil War, a question remained whether a slave
holder from a Confederate state (or even a non-seceding slave state like
Maryland) could enforce the law despite the open hostilities. An
abolitionist general in the Union Army in the Western theater, John C.
Frémont, issued a military proclamation freeing the slaves of any slave
holder in Missouri who took up arms in rebellion.131 Abolitionists
cheered this move, but conservatives in the north did not approve of it
and Lincoln was concerned that such efforts might alienate border states
that still recognized slavery. He would ultimately rescind the order.
132

Another Union officer, Benjamin Butler, a lawyer-turned-general who was
commanding Fort Monroe, a Union garrison in northern Virginia, took a
slightly different approach, and this creative approach helped advance
the abolitionist cause on firmer ground than Frémont's efforts had done.
When three slaves who had been forced to assist the Confederate forces
in building breastworks across the river from the Union fortress slipped
under cover of darkness behind Union lines and presented themselves to
Butler, he was forced to confront the applicability and enforceability
of the Fugitive Slave Act in their situation. Butler seems to have had a
complicated view of slavery. A northern Democrat before the war, some
paint him as an abolitionist, and others reveal he very much feared that
free slaves might, if armed, rise up in rebellion and strike out
mercilessly against slave owners and their families.133

Nevertheless, as any self-respecting lawyer should do when faced with
whether to apply a law to a particular situation, he consulted the text
of the Fugitive Slave Act. For Butler, a plain reading of the law seemed
to require that a slave owner residing in a slave state could petition
federal authorities for return of an escaped slave. But Butler read the
law literally, and took into account the position of the slave states,
those in open rebellion like Virginia, from which these slaves had
escaped. That position held that Virginia, since it had claimed that it
seceded from the Union, was no longer a state. And if it was no longer a
state, a slave owner from Virginia could no longer claim rights under
the Fugitive Slave Act.134

Moreover, Butler took into account the role the slaves had played in
supporting the enemy troops across the river. They had been dragooned
into helping to build fortifications opposing the Union position and
thus had supported the Confederate war effort. Logically, if Butler had
come across a cache of Confederate gunpowder or cannon, it would be
preposterous to expect that he would return such contraband of war to
the rebel forces. Butler claimed the slaves were no different; they,
too, were contraband and he would not return them to the southern
side.135 Again, Butler used his enemy's own logic against it, arguing
that slaves were property, and used to aid in the enemy war effort. As
such, he determined he should not return them. Indeed, a Confederate
officer appeared under flag of truce, someone Butler knew from his days
as a politician and who was acting as an emissary of the Confederate
Colonel who claimed ownership of the slaves, and sought to reclaim the
slaves and enforce the Fugitive Slave Act, Butler refused.136 According
to Butler's autobiography, he told the adversary the following: "'I mean
to take Virginia at her word, as declared in the ordinance of secession
passed yesterday. I am under no constitutional obligations to a foreign
country, which Virginia now claims to be.'"137 Butler's position would
anger abolitionists, like Frederick Douglass, who proclaimed that these
escaped slaves were not to be considered contraband, as if they were
pistols,138 nevertheless, Butler's clever use of the Southern arguments
to undermine their position seemed to offer a basis upon which Butler
could conclude he was under no obligation to return the escaped slaves.
What it would also do would solve a problem that President Lincoln
faced: how to hold his coalition together, i.e., his collection of
factions that included those who wanted to abolish slavery and those who
wanted to save the Union. The value of this decision for assuaging the
different factions within Lincoln's coalition was not lost on an
editorial published in the Atlantic Monthly at the time:

There is often great virtue in such technical phrases in shaping public
opinion. They commend practical action to a class of minds little
developed in the direction of the sentiments, which would be repelled by
formulas of a broader and nobler import. The venerable gentleman, who
wears gold spectacles and reads a conservative daily, prefers
confiscation to emancipation. He is reluctant to have slaves declared
freemen, but has no objection to their being declared contrabands. His
whole nature rises in insurrection when Beecher preaches in a sermon
that a thing out to be done because it is a duty, but he yields
gracefully when Butler issues an order commanding it to be done because
it is a military necessity.139

Nevertheless, Butler's position put the other lawyer I will highlight in
this example, Abraham Lincoln, in another uncomfortable spot, as Frémont
had months earlier. As said, Lincoln had a fragile coalition of
unionists who were supporting the war effort to preserve the republic,
and abolitionists who believed it was a crusade to end slavery.140
Lincoln needed some way to tie this coalition together and he would
consider the question whether bringing escaped slaves and free blacks
into the war effort by arming them and forming black regiments to fight
on the Union side.141 He knew he was depleting his stock of eligible
fighting men in the North and saw the opportunity that presented itself
of recruiting thousands of blacks to join the war effort. But he knew
also that he would have to take steps toward freeing the slaves, at
least escaped slaves and those liberated from southern territories, in
order to offer these potential recruits, and the abolitionists who
supported such an effort, cause to support black enlistment.142 His
policies toward slavery over the years had evolved. At times he would
support colonization for freed slaves, and, at others, compensation for
slave owners who would be forced to give up their slaves.143 Lincoln
would ultimately settle on the notion that in order to keep his
coalition together, he would need to both support the enlistment of
black troops while giving them and their supporters reason to enlist.
This would satisfy the unionists who would recognize the need to recruit
black troops to support the war effort and the desire of the
abolitionists to end slavery, at least in the South.144 This two-pronged
approach would culminate in the drafting of Lincoln's Emancipation
Proclamation, which would free slaves in occupied territories and those
who escaped to Union lines (a recognition, in a way, of the predicament
in which Butler found himself and a nod to his on-the-fly solution). But
Lincoln still faced another hurdle before he could release the
Proclamation.

The Union war effort had stalled. General McLellan's campaign to strike
decisively at the heart of the Confederacy had ground to a frustrating
halt on the Virginia peninsula.145 Grant had not yet emerged as the
brilliant and dogged tactician he would prove to be in subsequent years
and his campaign in the Mississippi was not going well.146 The major
foreign powers of Great Britain and France watched developments in the
war with great interest, poised to recognize the Confederacy, if not aid
it outright, if it appeared that the South might be able to secure some
kind of brokered peace and remain intact.147 Were Lincoln to release the
Emancipation Proclamation at a point the Union war effort was going
poorly, he might seem weak, and its issuance a desperate, last-ditch
effort to alter the course of the war. Lincoln needed a victory on the
battlefield to give him an opening in which he could issue the
proclamation, and he would get one when Robert E. Lee would test the
Union resolve in a march on Maryland, a slave state that, the Southern
general felt, might welcome Confederate troops as heroes as opposed to
invaders. Such a move would also likely have the effect of drawing
McLellan's troops away from their likely march on Richmond, should the
"Little Napoleon," as he was called, ever exhibit any of the French
emperor's aggressiveness on the battlefield (he would not). McLellan's
forces would clash with Lee's near the tiny town of Antietam in
Maryland, which would ultimately lend its name to the bloody melee that
would ensue there.148 While historians often consider the battle a
stalemate, Lee's retreat from the field, after both sides suffered heavy
losses, gave Lincoln the opportunity he needed to claim victory and
issue the Emancipation Proclamation at one of the few high points of the
war for the North, at least to that point.149 What this edict would do
would help unite Lincoln's fragile coalition around the cause of ending
slavery because it was through the effort to end slavery, in Lincoln's
eyes, that would ultimately bring about the preservation of the Union.

Lincoln's chosen tactics in promoting abolition, at least in the
Confederate states, was consistent with a prior statement on the
interplay between abolition and maintaining the integrity of the nation.
In a letter to abolitionist publisher Horace Greeley, Lincoln emphasized
that his primary goal was to save the Union. To do so, he believed he
needed to end slavery. Thus, his war aims, and those of the
abolitionists who sought to end slavery, would converge.

My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and not
either to save or destroy slavery.

If I could save the Union without freeing any slave, I would do it; if I
could save it by freeing all the slaves, I would do it; and if I could
save it by freeing some and leaving others alone, I would also do that.

What I do about slavery and the coloured race, I do because I believe it
helps to save the Union; and what I forbear, I forbear because I do not
believe it would help to save the Union.150

Lincoln's issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation was consistent with
this approach. It satisfied the abolitionists, for sure, but also tied
the unionists to the abolitionist cause by linking emancipation directly
to the war effort. As one excerpt of the proclamation reads:

And I further declare and make known that such persons of suitable
condition will be received into the armed service of the United States
to garrison forts, positions, stations, and other places, and to man
vessels of all sorts in said service.151

Lincoln, the tactician, proved adept, and creative, at using a legal
strategy---here, the Emancipation Proclamation---and timing it in light
of a major development in the war (the battle of Antietam), to help
achieve what would appear to have been his ultimate social change goal:
preservation of the Union.

Of course, the cause of civil rights would not end with the victory of
Union forces, or even passage of the Reconstruction Amendments to the
Constitution. The next example to highlight is the effort to end Jim
Crow segregation, which followed the collapse of the effort at reforming
the South in the wake of Reconstruction. 152

B. Lawyers and the End of Jim Crow

Unlike most discussions of this legal campaign, hatched in the offices
of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund (LDF) and those of other legal allies, I
will not start with a discussion of the landmark case of Brown v. Board
of Education, in which the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that
segregation in educational institutions violated the Equal Protection
Clause of the 5th and 14th Amendments to the Constitution, which would
spell the beginning of the end of the institutional edifice of Jim
Crow.153 The paradigm of social change litigation through which the
lawyers would take direct legal aim at segregation in a broad-based
challenge to the practice, would have its predecessors in more modest,
incremental, and narrowly crafted challenges to other institutions in an
effort to build the legal case that might serve as a base that could
help launch the broader attack with success.154

Hemann Sweatt was a postman in Texas who wanted to go to law school in
the late 1940s.155 The problem was, there were no law schools in the
state of Texas that admitted African Americans. Sweatt would submit his
application to the University of Texas School of Law, asserting that,
since the state university system did not have a separate law school for
African Americans, the law school that system did operate had to admit
him.156 The state hastily put together what it would try to call a law
school, but that entity would have no full-time faculty (it would
"borrow" faculty from the main law school), no law books, no alumni
base, and was unaccredited.157 The LDF would challenge the university's
solution to the Sweatt application, arguing that, yes, segregation was
unconstitutional. The lawyers also had a fallback position, however.
They would argue that, taking the holding in Plessy seriously, the
university system was obligated, if it was planning on offering separate
institutions, those institutions also had to be equal.

By any objective measure, the law school for African Americans was in no
way equal to that offered to white students in the University of Texas
system. The unaccredited school for African Americans with no faculty
and essentially no students and no books could not measure up to the
University of Texas's school of law, which had 850 students, a vast
alumni network, 65,000 books in its library, and was fully
accredited.158 Even when the case had gone to trial and the law school
for African Americans had 23 students, five full-time faculty, and
10,000 books, it still could not compare in quality or degree to the
opportunities afforded the students enrolled in the all-white
institution.159 Even putting aside these objective measures, the LDF
lawyers also argued that a law school is so much more than the books in
its library or the physical accommodations. A law school is a platform
for knowledge exchange and a network that creates mentorships and job
opportunities for its students. It connects those students to the bench
and the broader practicing bar. A good law school is more than just the
sum of its parts and develops value to its students because of the
relationship of those parts to each other and to the broader community.
A law school with fewer faculty, no alumni network, and weak ties to the
broader community could not possibly afford its students the same
opportunities that the University of Texas's law school for whites
offered its students.160

While the lawyers knew all these things about the qualities that make a
great law school, they knew something else as well. They intuited that
the judges would also know this about a law school.161 The judges before
whom such a case would come would all have gone to law school, would all
know the ineffable qualities of a good law school, and they could
compare the extent to which two law schools were comparable along these
difficult-tomeasure metrics. While the LDF had tried to bring other,
somewhat successful lawsuits challenging segregation in other graduate
and professional schools, it was the action filed against segregation in
a separate and unequal law school where they would gain the greatest
legal traction.162 While they would certainly include a direct challenge
to segregation itself, and they enlisted the support of an
anthropologist (who was also a lawyer) to make the claim that
segregation was itself stigmatizing (foreshadowing the arguments they
would make in Brown), they would also rely on a secondary position that,
even if one recognized that separate but equal was still the law of the
land, and Plessy was good law, if one took Plessy seriously, the
separate and clearly unequal institution set up as the law school for
African Americans in the University of Texas law school would not pass
muster.163 Moreover, by challenging the way in which segregation
operated in an institution judges would understand well, the LDF lawyers
made a brilliant tactical decision to appeal to the judge's own
appreciation for the special qualities upon which one can compare
separate institutions, more so, perhaps than they might understand other
institutions that the LDF might target. Ultimately, the Supreme Court
would conclude, unanimously, in the Sweatt v. Painter decision, not that
segregation was unconstitutional on its face, but, rather, that the
operation of a separate---and clearly unequal---law school for African
Americans could not pass constitutional muster.

One of these reasons---apart from the objective criteria---that the
Court reached this conclusion was that it was "more important" that the
law school for whites "possesses to a far greater degree those qualities
which are incapable of objective measurement but which make for
greatness in a law school."164 These qualities included, but were not
limited to the following: the "reputation of the faculty, experience of
the administration, position and influence of the alumni, standing in
the community, traditions and prestige."165 While the Court could easily
differentiate the two schools along objective criteria, concluding that
"\[i\]t is difficult to believe that one who had a free choice between
these law schools would consider the question close."166 Moreover,
"\[f\]ew students and no one who has practiced law would choose to study
in an academic vacuum, removed from the interplay of ideas and the
exchange of views with which the law is concerned."167 The school for
African Americans "excludes from its student body members of the racial
groups which number 85% of the population of the State and include most
of the lawyers, witnesses, jurors, judges and other officials with whom
petitioner will inevitably be dealing when he becomes a member of the
Texas Bar."168 For these reasons, the Court could not conclude "that the
education offered petitioner is substantially equal to that which he
would receive if admitted to the University of Texas Law School."169

In many ways, this incremental challenge to segregation would ultimately
set the stage for the lawyers' work that followed in bringing the
broader challenges to segregation in primary and secondary educational
institutions in several jurisdictions across the country, which would
culminate in the victory in Brown. In those challenges, the LDF lawyers
would bring in experts from other disciplines, like sociology, to
establish that segregation had a stigmatizing effect.170 They would
build on the arguments made in Sweatt that separate was inherently
unequal, and, once again, the Supreme Court would rule unanimously in
their favor, this time concluding that separate but equal would no
longer stand.

C. Lawyers and Marriage Equality

The final example to use here is the work of the lawyers who helped to
lead the successful campaign for recognition of marriage equality for
the LGBTQ community. That campaign, which was really many campaigns, the
first of which was launched in the early 1990s in Hawaii, proceeded in
fits and starts. There were victories in the courts in Hawaii, Vermont,
and Massachusetts, on state constitutional grounds, but at least some of
those victories were undermined by legislative action, or the work of
advocacy groups that organized ballot initiatives to overrule those
courts by adopting constitutional amendments that barred recognition of
same-sex marriage.171 In addition, fear that states would be expected to
recognize same-sex marriages in states where they were legal prompted
Congress to take legislative action and pass the Defense of Marriage Act
(DOMA),172 which would attempt to offer states protection from such a
requirement and ensure that the federal government would not be expected
to recognize marriage rights for same-sex couples with respect to a
range of federal benefits that accrued to married heterosexuals.
Moreover, the forces aligned against marriage equality gained enough
momentum that they would seek to introduce anti-same-sex marriage ballot
initiatives in many states, mostly timed to generate conservative voter
turnout for the 2004 presidential election year.173 Most of these ballot
initiatives would succeed.174 When conservative groups sought to promote
a ballot initiative in California, a deeply liberal state, many thought
they had gone too far, and that the voters of the state would reject
it.175

On election night 2008, when the nation was electing its first
AfricanAmerican president, and voters in California voted overwhelmingly
in his favor, they would also pass so-called Proposition 8, which banned
same-sex marriage in the state.176 This came as a shock to advocates for
same-sex marriage across the nation and led them to take stock of their
efforts and consider what, if anything, they might do differently in the
future to promote same-sex marriage and rebound from this devastating
defeat.177

Advocates in the LGBTQ community and their allies conducted a review of
their efforts to defeat Proposition 8. They worked with researchers to
conduct focus groups and surveys of voters to assess what they had done
wrong and how they might change their strategies and tactics. This
review produced startling results.178 They learned that the way they had
been going about promoting same-sex marriage was all wrong. They had
made legalistic arguments, like same-sex couples were denied hospital
visiting privileges and other benefits granted heterosexual couples.
These types of arguments, they would learn, left many potential allies
cold and led them to believe that the advocates were seeking something
different from what heterosexual couples achieved through marriage.179
Voters told them they thought the advocates were looking for special
treatment for same-sex couples. For the advocates, nothing could be
farther from the truth. Indeed, what the advocates wanted was simply
equal treatment: i.e., marriage equality. 180 They took this feedback to
heart and began to shift their message in subtle yet powerful ways. They
would begin to advocate for marriage equality, not same-sex marriage.
They would stress that what the LQBTQ community wanted was equal
recognition of their relationships and equal access to the institution
of marriage, on the same terms as heterosexual couples. This subtle
shift would begin to turn the tide.181

In addition to the shift in messaging, as with the desegregation
litigation, legal advocates challenging Proposition 8 in the courts
would deploy expert witnesses from the disciplines of sociology and
psychology to undermine the key arguments of the ballot initiative's
supporters.182

In 2012, just four years after the devastating loss in California, they
would win ballot initiatives in Maine, Minnesota, Maryland and
Washington State.183 Two years later, they would win a challenge to
certain core aspects of DOMA in U.S. v. Windsor. 184 Finally, in 2015,
they would win the landmark Obergefell v. Hodges, 185 which would
establish that states could not deny members of the LGBTQ community
access to marriage. Justice Kennedy, speaking for the majority, would
side with those who favored the marriage equality arguments as opposed
to the "special treatment" arguments that preceded the loss in the
Proposition 8 fight:

\[B\]y virtue of their exclusion from that institution, same-sex couples
are denied the constellation of benefits that the States have linked to
marriage. This harm results in more than just material burdens. Same-sex
couples are consigned to an instability many opposite-sex couples would
deem intolerable in their own lives. As the State itself makes marriage
all the more precious by the significance it attaches to it, exclusion
from that status has the effect of teaching that gays and lesbians are
unequal in important respects. It demeans gays and lesbians for the
State to lock them out of a central institution of the Nation\'s
society. Same-sex couples, too, may aspire to the transcendent purposes
of marriage and seek fulfillment in its highest meaning.186

The triumph of the marriage equality campaign follows a tradition of
creative lawyering for social change that dates back to the Civil War
era, and even to the framing of the U.S. Constitution. I have used three
examples of lawyers who contributed to successful efforts to bring about
social change. Are there common lessons that one can draw from these
experiences? The next Part addresses this question.

III\. A TAXONOMY OF CREATIVE SOCIAL CHANGE LAWYERING

This review of the role of lawyers in the campaign to end slavery in the
United States, defeat Jim Crow, and advance the cause of marriage
equality for the LGBTQ community reveals some common themes of such work
and the ways in which [lawyers working for social change can **adopt
creative strategies** for promoting that [change]{.mark}]{.underline}.
As the following discussion shows, some of these themes include that
[the work is often **incremental** and **iterative**; it
[involves]{.mark}]{.underline} what is sometimes referred to as
["**[reframing]{.mark}**" -- looking at [issues in **new**]{.mark}, and
**different [ways]{.mark}**[, **especially the arguments of one's
opponents**; it]{.mark} often **[borrows from other
disciplines]{.mark}**; it **[seeks out]{.mark} opportunities for
[interest convergence]{.mark}** among otherwise disparate groups; and it
**[does not operate in a vacuum]{.mark}** in that it is often
**conscious of corresponding events** in society that might have a
bearing on the **ways in which legal strategies will be perceived** and
**whether they will be supported** at a particular point in
time]{.underline}. I will discuss each of these characteristics, in
turn, below.

A. Incremental, Iterative Advocacy

Probably [[the **main common feature**]{.mark} of]{.underline} these
three examples of [creative lawyering [is]{.mark}]{.underline} that each
involved [**incremental** and **[iterative steps]{.mark}**. For the
**end of slavery**]{.underline}, while the factions within Lincoln's
fragile coalition may have disagreed about what the North's goals should
be, [the **[smaller steps taken]{.mark}**]{.underline} to address the
issue of escaped slaves finding themselves among Union troops [helped to
[**lay the ground work** for]{.mark} what would ultimately become the
**[Emancipation]{.mark} Proclamation**]{.underline}, and, at the
conclusion of the war, adoption of the 13th Amendment during
Reconstruction. Lincoln did not announce an end to slavery at the outset
of the war. If he had done so, he might have faced the prospect of the
border states that had both remained slave holding but also stayed in
the Union deciding to secede, or at least not supporting the war effort.
Similarly, conservatives in the North might have aligned themselves
behind the war effort for the purpose of preserving the Union, but might
not have embraced such an effort if it was perceived as primarily a
campaign to end slavery. The incremental steps taken by Union generals
like Frémont and, more effectively, the attorney and fortress commander
General Butler, helped lay the groundwork for the Emancipation
Proclamation, where Lincoln was able to satisfy different elements of
his fragile coalition. [It was **[only]{.mark}** through this
**[incremental]{.mark}**, **iterative strategy** that [showed]{.mark}
that [**doing nothing about slavery** would be **unacceptable**]{.mark}
to the abolitionists]{.underline}, but Frémont's strategy went too far
for some. In the end, Butler's approach seemed to be "just right", a
balancing of interests that tied abolition to the war effort. [This type
of approach, accomplished through **experimentation** and **iteration**,
may have helped **show Lincoln the way forward**, by revealing a
strategy that would **bind the different fractious elements** of his
ruling coalition]{.underline}.

Similarly, [[the **LDF's**]{.mark} **iterative**, **incremental
[approach]{.mark}** also [helped to **lay the groundwork** for]{.mark}
the campaign that would **ultimately succeed**, [bring]{.mark}ing about
the victory in **[Brown v. Board]{.mark} of Education** and [an **end to
Jim Crow**]{.mark} in education, [and]{.mark} which would help [**light
a fire** among the activists that]{.mark} helped them **[bring]{.mark}
about [changes in public accommodations]{.mark}**[, **housing**, and
**voting**]{.mark} **through legislative victories**, the organizing for
which had been prompted by the end of separate but equal. The LDF
lawyers]{.underline} in Sweatt and other, similar cases, [**took on
smaller**, **individual institutions** rather than those they would
assail in the collection of cases that would lead to Brown, which
attacked the broader edifice of Jim Crow]{.underline}. While these
lawyers certainly challenged Jim Crow directly, cases like Sweatt
afforded the judges before whom the cases were filed an opportunity to
slowly chip away at the broader system. By filing this sort of smaller,
probing attack against an institution like a law school, an institution
the judges would understand, they made it possible to show that a school
system would have a hard time offering separate and equal institutions.

[[Incrementalism]{.mark} also **[helps]{.mark} advocates
[develop]{.mark} different types of [arguments]{.mark}**[, **field test
them**, **explore how**]{.mark} **well [they are received]{.mark}** by a
wider audience, [and **bring back**]{.mark} **the [feedback]{.mark}**
from such efforts [to **further hone those**]{.mark} **arguments** in
broader contexts.]{.underline} In many ways, [[this]{.mark}
**iterative**, **incremental approach** [is]{.mark} akin to]{.underline}
the concept known as ["[**design thinking**,]{.mark}"]{.underline}187
which is sometimes seen as having four, main components: inspiration;
synthesis; ideation and experimentation; and implementation.188 The
inspiration phase is investigatory. It involves communicating with those
who are most affected by a problem or issue to work with them to explore
potential solutions.189 Once the inspiration phase is complete
(although, in some ways, it is never really complete), the design
thinker moves into the ideation and experimentation phase where
[[**prototypes are developed** and]{.mark} **field-[tested]{.mark} to
assess their effectiveness** in terms of **addressing the problem at
hand**]{.underline}.190 [The [results]{.mark} of this rapid prototyping
help to [**create a feedback loop** and]{.mark} the original
[efforts]{.mark} and tactics [are]{.mark} then **[altered in
response]{.mark}** to the data received through the successes and
failures of those prototypes to **create new prototypes** and **run new
experiments**]{.underline}.191 [[After **successful prototyping**, a
finished]{.mark} product or [idea can go "**mainstream**]{.mark},"
although the **experimentation**, **iteration**, **feedback**, and
**modification** is an **ongoing process**]{.underline}.192 [This
design-thinking approach is **similar** to]{.underline} how Linda Morton
describes [**legal creative problem solving**. That
process]{.underline}, for her, [includes **identification of the
problem**, **understanding it**, **posing solutions**, **choosing
solutions**, **implementing solutions**, and **engaging in a final
analysis** of such solutions]{.underline}.193 Similarly, the ABA, in its
1992 report, identifies several technical steps related to problem
solving, including identification of the problem, the generation of
solutions to the problem, developing and implementing a plan of action,
and remaining open to new information and ideas.194

[A design-thinking approach to creative problem solving would seem
**perfectly suited for social change advocacy** in the legal
context]{.underline}.195 [Lawyers can **gather**]{.underline} the
**[perspectives]{.underline}** of their clients [to **understand the
problem** they are trying to solve and **begin to develop solutions** to
such problems, can **prototype potential solutions** based on that
fact-finding process, can **launch** "prototypes" of such solutions into
the world to **see how they fare** and **bring feedback** from those
efforts to **craft more robust solutions**, and then can **take more
dramatic steps** based on those iterated prototypes and the lessons
learned from the prototyping process and the feedback loop it
generates]{.underline}. 196

B. Interpretive Creativity

[We also see]{.underline} in these examples [that]{.underline} the
[[creative lawyers]{.mark} seeking social change [engaged
in]{.mark}]{.underline} a degree of [**interpretative creativity**,
often **re-framing the legal issues in new ways** or [**borrowing from
their opponents' arguments** and **using such**]{.mark} **arguments
[against them]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Menkel-Meadow calls this
notion of reframing [[finding new "**entry points**"]{.mark}: a **new
way of looking at a problem from different
perspectives**]{.underline}.197 Of course, [many lawyers spend much of
their time interpreting statutes, regulations, contracts, and behavior
in light of all three, but social change lawyers are often in a **more
difficult position** than the traditional lawyer because their paths to
interpretative success are **narrower**. They are **trying to change the
status quo** and **alter the legal infrastructure** that governs
behavior within that status quo. **Common interpretations** of the
**scope** and **contours** of that infrastructure **gain some
interpretive force** because of the **widely shared** and **widely
accepted understandings** of their meaning]{.underline}. Of course,
[this forces the social change lawyer to **be more creative**
in]{.underline} her [interpretive efforts, and can leave]{.underline}
her with [**little choice** but to attempt to **seize
upon**]{.underline} her [**opponents' arguments**, **embrace them**, and
**bend them** to support the social change lawyer's
position]{.underline}.198

[This is often apparent in many efforts by [lawyers]{.mark} to advance
social change. They [may have little support]{.mark} for their own
positions [so they **turn to the positions of their opponents** to
**show**]{.mark} **the [hypocrisy]{.mark} of them**, [or]{.mark} the
fact [that they are **based on weak**]{.mark} **legal [force]{.mark}
themselves**. This is **often an important asset** for the social change
advocate fighting long odds]{.underline}. Malcolm Gladwell, in his work,
David and Goliath: Underdogs, Misfits, and the Art of Battling Giants,
points out that [**[our perception of power asymmetries are often
wrong]{.mark}**. The **very [qualities]{.mark}** [that may **appear to
give strength**]{.mark} to a dominant individual or entity [are often a
source of]{.mark} "**great [weakness]{.mark}**."]{.underline}199 The
Biblical Goliath was weighted down by his bulk and heavy armor.200
Turkish fortifications were easily overrun by Lawrence of Arabia's
nimble Bedouin cavalry.201 [For the social change lawyer, [when]{.mark}
the [arguments of]{.mark}]{.underline} her [\[their\] [adversary, that
**may have enjoyed**]{.mark} **support** from what may be seen as
[common sense]{.mark} arguments, [are **held up to rigorous analysis**,
they]{.mark} often **[collapse under their own
weight]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

In the decades leading up to the decision in Obergefell, advocates for
the rights of the LGBTQ community won victories in the Supreme Court
showing that a state constitutional amendment in Colorado stripping
local communities of the ability to pass pro-LQBTQ rights ordinances,
and laws against sodomy, were based on little more than the moral
preferences of legislators that could not withstand careful scrutiny.202
Similarly, in the state courts of New York, a legal definition of family
that appeared based on little more than "traditional" notions, with no
basis in law, failed to recognize the many ways in which families form
and their members recognize themselves as such.203 The [arguments
**supporting the opponents' position** may have been, **at one time**,
**consistent with the common sensibilities** of some portion of the
population and may have, **at one time**, **seemed inevitable** and
**subject to little criticism**. When **analyzed** for their **source**
and their **logic**, however, these arguments **proved insufficient to
support discriminatory treatment** through the force of
law.]{.underline}

[At the same time, if the **force of the common sense support** for the
opponent's position is **too strong** to overcome through a direct
attack, the social change lawyer often **uses**]{.underline} her
**[opponents' own arguments against them]{.underline}**. We saw this in
Butler's controversial cooption of Southern arguments about property and
secession in order to justify his refusal to enforce the Fugitive Slave
Act. Similarly, although the LDF would challenge segregation directly in
Sweatt, they also tried another line of argument: that, even accepting
separate but equal as the law of the land, the separate law school for
African Americans was not, in fact, equal by any measure. Thus,
[**forcing their opponents to defend their own position**, it **became
untenable on the facts**]{.underline}.

Artist Pablo [Picasso is sometimes quoted as having said that "**good
artists copy**, **great artists steal**."]{.underline}204 [Perhaps the
**best**, **most creative social change lawyers also steal**---they just
**steal from their opponents**]{.underline}.

C. Interdisciplinary Approaches

Another common feature of the social change efforts highlight here is
that lawyers in at least two of the three examples, the LDF lawyers and
the marriage equality advocates, explicitly incorporated
interdisciplinary approaches in their advocacy.205 Thurgood Marshall
would bring together sociologist, historians, political scientists,
educators and anthropologists when planning the anti-segregation
strategy.206 The Sweatt trial, like those that would lead to the Supreme
Court's decision in Brown that would follow, included expert testimony
from another discipline. In fact, anthropologist Robert Redfield,
chairman of the Department of Anthropology at the University of Chicago,
himself embodied interdisciplinarity: he held a doctorate in
Anthropology as well as a law degree.207 Redfield would testify about
the lack of differences in the educational capacity of African Americans
as compared to whites as well as the dangers of segregation in
education, particularly as they related to the price that society pays
for the distrust segregation creates among the population. 208 In Brown,
Thurgood Marshall and the legal team would utilize the research and
testimony of psychiatrist Frederic Wertham and sociologist Kenneth B.
Clark to show the harmful effects of segregation on African-American
children.209

In the marriage equality litigation, expert witnesses were used in trial
courts to show the complete lack of evidence to support the opponents'
positions that marriage could not be open to same-sex couples because,
the opponents argued, children did not fare well when reared in families
headed by parents of the same sex.210 In addition, in the wake of the
failure to defeat Proposition 8, advocates enlisted the support of
researchers in surveying and conducting focus groups to understand the
failure of the campaign's messaging strategies.211

In many ways, the social change lawyer's use of interdisciplinary
strategies builds on the iterative and interpretative approaches
described above in that it helps to reframe arguments and tests other
theories against perceived wisdom and common understandings of the law
and society that may need to change in order to bring about wider social
change. Such interdisciplinary approaches are not new, as Louis
Brandeis, then a practicing lawyer in the early 20th century, utilized
social science to support his legal claims.212 By incorporating
disciplines other than law, social change advocates widen their own lens
when they view a problem and start to begin to see legal issues in a
different light, which then helps them frame their arguments and present
new theories and new ways of looking at the world to judges, juries,
policymakers, legislators and the general public. In turn, these
theories, informed by interdisciplinary views, might find an audience
more receptive to these arguments because they help that audience see
the law in different ways, undermining traditional understandings and
interpretations of the law and social relations. Those new
understandings and interpretations can lead to the social change the
lawyer and those she serves may seek to bring about.

D. Interest Convergence

The lawyers for the Civil Rights Movement and President Lincoln knew not
only that they could build a coalition to achieve their social change
goals, but that they had to do so, and they both crafted these
coalitions around the interests different members and groups shared.
This convergence of interest helped to build and sustain critical
coalitions necessary to support and advance the social change movement
leaders and their lawyers wanted to bring about. The late Derrick Bell
first identified the notion that interest convergence could justify
changes to our collective understanding of constitutional law. Bell
first articulated his Interest-Convergence Theory in response to Herbert
Wechsler's argument critiquing the Court's decision in Brown. Weschler
argued that Brown was not supportable by what he called "neutral
principles": when a court "reach\[es\] judgment on analysis and reasons
quite transcending the immediate result that is achieved."213 Wechsler
argued that promoting the freedom of association of blacks could not
undermine the freedom of association of whites.214

Countering Weschler, Bell asserted that the shared interests between the
black community and a large proportion of the white community justified
the decision in Brown. 215 For Bell, the interests of blacks (and
others) in seeking an end to segregation aligned with national white
elites who were concerned with the U.S. standing in the world,
particularly as it sought to maintain its influence in post-colonial
nations where the Soviet Union was using the Jim Crow system as a wedge
between the U.S. and potential allies.216 Mary Dudziak's archival
research lends ample support for Bell's explanation of the forces that
aligned to bring about the unanimous decision in Brown. 217

Bell utilized Interest-Convergence Theory in order to explain and
justify the Court's decision in Brown. Some have taken this theory a
step farther, as a way to not just understand but also to promote social
change generally: when one wants to advance social change, one should
look for an alignment of interests among different factions and
communities and seek out ways to build coalitions around such interests.
218 The theory itself is not above critique, however, and it is argued
that it is flawed in that it appears to discount the agency of advocates
in spurring social change, suggesting that one needs to wait for
interests to converge to bring about social change.219 But lawyers who
seek to support efforts to bring about social change can turn to
Interest-Convergence Theory as an organizing principle and guide, and
work with clients and partners to be the agents of that change.

While Bell identified the convergence of interests at the center of the
Civil Rights Movement's advocacy, this idea appears in the two other
examples described above. First, Lincoln tied an end to slavery to
preserving the union. In order to hold his coalition together, he knew
he needed to address the slavery question and seek to bring about its
end. He could only go so far with his Emancipation Proclamation,
however, and slavery was not abolished in the border states that both
maintained slaveholding yet remained loyal to the union. For those who
saw victory on the battle field as essential to preserving the union,
freeing the slaves in confederate states and territories occupied by
Union forces increased the number of eligible males available to serve
as troops in the Union army. The North's martial strategy, particularly
in the latter years of the conflict, was to field much larger armies,
attack Southern forces at as many points as possible to test their
capacity, and to strike at critical transportation and supply hubs.220
Each aspect of this strategy needed as many troops as possible, and
Lincoln knew that he could increase recruitment by making former slaves
available to join the army in order to carry out these strategic goals.
The Emancipation Proclamation would ultimately satisfy his coalition's
goals by tying the abolition of slavery to the goal of preserving the
union.

For the marriage equality advocates, within the LGBTQ movement generally
there was not always support for the effort to promote same-sex marriage
rights. As Nathaniel Frank recounts in his work Awakening: How Gays and
Lesbians Brought Marriage Equality to America, 221 members of the more
radical elements of the LGBTQ movement did not support the effort to
recognize same-sex marriages initially, but different strains of the
movement would ultimately coalesce around the idea of marriage equality
as a way to accomplish broader protections for the community, gain
respect, counter discrimination, and attain cultural acceptance of LQBTQ
members and relationships. 222 This sort of interest convergence also
occurred outside the movement itself as well. After President Obama
signaled his support for marriage equality, the NAACP announced its own
support for the effort, which represented a shift for the
African-American community after the results of the Proposition 8 vote
in California showed communities of color narrowly supporting the
ban.223 For the NAACP, they identified a robust interpretation of the
Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution, which is what the marriage
equality advocates sought, as consistent with their own interests and
their own views on the applicable constitutional protections.224 In each
of these situations, Bell's Interest-Convergence approach seems to
represent an aspect of the lawyers' strategy: keep fragile coalitions
together, and bring new groups into the coalition, through the
thoughtful curation of shared interests.

E. Interdependence

Similarly, the legal advocates in each of these situations did not
advocate in a vacuum and were always conscious of events and trends in
the culture and society generally. Lincoln waited for a victory on the
battle field before he released the Emancipation Proclamation. A deeply
religious man, he is sometimes described as waiting for a victory
because he sought a spiritual sign that his cause was just.225 He and
his cabinet advisors were also keenly aware that release of the
proclamation when the North was losing the war would be seen as an act
of desperation.226 Lincoln's willingness to create a new legal approach
to slaves that had escaped lands controlled by Confederate forces was in
some ways beholden to the larger forces at play as he considered the
proclamation's release. Moreover, Lincoln would strike a delicate
balance in the manner and timing of the issuance of the proclamation,
particularly as it related to both enhancing the northern forces'
capacity to recruit more able-bodied soldiers as well as preserving the
slaveholding status of loyal border states.

With the lawyers supporting the Civil Rights Movement, they were keenly
aware of the predicament in which national leaders found themselves on
the geopolitical stage. They exploited the fact that the standing of the
U.S. with developing nations while the country was engaged in
competition with Soviet Bloc countries for global influence.227
Throughout the course of the Civil Rights Movement's struggle in the
courts and as the movement went from the courts to the streets and the
halls of Congress in the 1960s, the national security and foreign policy
components of the civil rights strategy played a role in the movement's
advocacy to bring about legislative changes to private accommodations,
housing, and voting rights. This aspect of the strategy was not lost on
national leaders. In a conversation with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.,
President Lyndon Johnson praised his legislative efforts in promoting
civil rights, referencing the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as follows: "I
think the greatest achievement in foreign policy \[of the Johnson
administration\]...was the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act." 228

Progressive advocates have also shifted their focus away from the
federal courts in many instances as a reaction to the ways in which the
federal judiciary has become more conservative since the Reagan
Administration began to use the judicial appointment power to select
more overtly partisan judges, something that continued through the
presidency of George W. Bush, and has proceeded apace during the Trump
Administration. As a part of this campaign, at least originally, Reagan
Administration officials sought to curtail the type of social change
litigation, like Brown, that came to be known as public law
litigation.229 This effort was designed to protect not just federal
actors from judicial oversight, but also state and local government
allies of the Administration, from judicial intervention in their
practices.230 In what Derrick Bell might call an interest convergence,
pro-business forces also advocated for relief from litigation.231
Finally, members of the judiciary, for political reasons or out of a
desire to control their own dockets, sought mechanisms for reining in
many different types of litigation, including public law/social change
litigation.232 Indeed, in decisions such as Bell Atlantic v. Twombly233
and Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 234 the Supreme Court altered the rules of
pleading to require litigants to set forth their claims and defenses
with such specificity that they might render such claims "plausible" in
the eyes of the judge. 235 Second, courts have made the dispositive
remedy of summary judgment more readily available by interpreting Rule
56 of the Rules more favorably for moving parties so that they might
avoid trial on the merits. 236 Third, courts have interpreted
fee-shifting statutes more narrowly than in the past, making contingency
fee cases less attractive to the private bar. 237 Fourth, courts have
taken a more expansive view of government immunity for both state and
local officials.238 In addition, courts have raised the standard for
certifying expert witnesses,239 made class actions more difficult to
commence and sustain,240 recognized the enforceability of arbitration
clauses, 241 and refused to engage in oversight of institutions that are
the subject of reform litigation.242 Owen Fiss has described these and
other trend away from public law litigation as a "counterrevolution" in
the courts. 243 As a result, in many instances, progressive lawyers have
had to explore tactics for promoting progressive social change
objectives other than through the filing of highprofile impact
litigation in the federal courts.

In many ways, [the fact that the **federal courts have become more
hostile** to]{.underline} public law litigation in general, and, by
extension, [social change litigation]{.underline} in particular, [has
led to the type of **pluralistic approaches** that many social change
lawyers are adopting, seeking out **new avenues for redress** and
**advocacy** apart from **looking solely to the federal courts** as the
venue for and the target of advocacy]{.underline}.244 While litigation
is often a common tactic used by progressive lawyers, [many have turned
to **state courts** as the forum in which to litigate claims based on
state constitutions and state law]{.underline}.245 [But **[litigation
alone is not the only tactic]{.mark}** utilized by lawyers working for
social change. They are [also]{.mark} engaged in **[legislative
advocacy]{.mark}**,]{.underline}246 **[[policy
change]{.underline}]{.mark}**,247 [**[community development
efforts]{.mark}** through the provision of **[transactional legal
services]{.mark}**,]{.underline}248 [[and]{.mark} **lending support to
[grassroots organizing]{.mark}**]{.underline}.249

Since the Brown litigation preceded this conservative backlash in the
courts, and, some would argue, was the reason for it,250 we must turn to
the tactics of the marriage equality movement to assess whether this
turning away from federal courts is a part of that pluralistic tactical
approach, embedded in a realpolitik that recognizes these wider trends
in society in general and their ramifications on the federal judiciary.
As we saw with Lincoln with Antietam and the civil rights advocates and
their recognition of the role that foreign policy interests could play
in applying pressure on the federal government to support their cause,
the marriage equality advocates waited until the point where the wider
aims could be served by litigating in federal court despite the
obstacles described above, choosing to litigate in state courts, under
state constitutional provisions, until the opportunity presented itself
to bring the broader challenge to prohibitions on same-sex marriage
under the U.S. Constitution. At the same time, the landmark cases of the
LQBTG rights advocacy---Romer v. Evans, 251 Lawrence v. Texas, 252 U.S.
v. Windsor, 253 and Obergefell v. Hodges254---were all filed in federal
court and made their way to the U.S. Supreme Court. For each of these
cases, a federal constitutional issue was at the heart of the
litigation, and, even if the case had begun in state court, the Supreme
Court would have been the ultimate arbiter of the claims. The litigants
may have had a choice of where they might file the case, there was no
doubt where the cases would ultimately end up. At the same time, with
the [**painstaking**, **incremental work**]{.underline} of the marriage
equality advocacy, that work, [**seeking out strategic victories where
they could find them** in order to **create a critical mass of
victories**]{.underline} at the state level, [was]{.underline}, for the
most part, carried out in state courts. From Hawaii to Massachusetts and
Vermont, the marriage equality advocates, fearing resistance at the
Supreme Court and the fact that the federal judiciary might not be ready
to rule in their favor, filed lawsuits based mostly on state
constitutional grounds. Thus, these advocates were [**not insensitive to
the trends** in the courts and wider society, and **crafted strategies**
that were **mindful of those trends** when they decided]{.underline} the
[legal steps]{.underline} to advance the cause of marriage equality.255

The [legal advocacy]{.underline} directed at social change described
here seems to indicate that these highlighted efforts shared several
common themes. These [efforts were **often incremental** in nature. They
**required creativity** in terms of the ways in which the advocates
viewed the law. They **often involved interdisciplinary approaches**.
The advocates **sought out opportunities** to **build coalitions**
through **finding common ground**]{.underline}---referred to here as
interest convergence---[with **likely** and **unlikely partners**. And
they viewed their work **in the context of what was happening in the
world outside of their advocacy**, assessing their work in light of the
**broader social context** and **making tactical decisions** based on
that context]{.underline}. In the previous Part, I identified the
challenges that lawyers working for social change and the extent to
which those challenges require creativity. In the next and concluding
Part, I will attempt to assess the extent to which these components of
the three efforts to bring about social change I have highlighted here
might offer ways for social change lawyers to overcome these challenges,
through creativity.

IV\. CREATIVITY AND THE SOCIAL CHANGE LAWYER

In Part II, I set forth some of the challenges lawyers must face when
they try to bring about social change. We hope that such lawyers seek to
make the lives of their clients---however they identify their
clients---better, through efforts to create lasting social change that
is meaningful to those clients. Such change work is challenging,
however, precisely because it involves change: change to power
relations, change to the status quo, change in the policies that impact
clients. Those challenges include that, first, they must alter the
existing laws and policies; they cannot simply work within existing
legal frameworks, using tried-and-true, formulaic, and time-tested
solutions to straightforward problems. Second, they must involve their
clients and the communities they serve in the critical strategic
decisions the lawyers make as they chart a course for the advocacy out
of fear that the legal strategy and the process by which it is developed
may further marginalize the clients. There is always a risk that
lawyer-centric strategies may weaken and distract from community efforts
to achieve self-determination and a more democratic society. Relying on
elites like members of the legal profession to engage in social
engineering that is not grounded in the lives and lived experience of
the clients those lawyers ostensibly serve might actually perpetuate
misunderstanding and marginalization, offering those communities
victories they have not sought and changes that are not necessarily
beneficial to them, further solidifying their outsider status. Lawyers
for social change must also strive to avoid a backlash against their
clients and the communities they represent, ensuring the ultimate goals
of the representation are not undermined by short-term victories. Third,
they must navigate between client demand and donor intent, finding ways
to fit their work within the constraints of existing funding sources, or
find ways to locate new financial support for work not supported by
existing funding streams. Fourth, social change lawyers must balance the
need to meet ongoing and direct needs of individual clients against the
longer-term, law reform efforts that build the political power that is
likely to bring about a re-ordering of social relations that are more
just. Fifth, and related to the fourth challenge, social change lawyers
must pursue complex goals and must do so on behalf of clients that are
not always easily identified. Sixth, the social change lawyer might have
to choose among a wider array of tactics than the traditional lawyer
simply because she may be foreclosed from using tactics commonly
utilized in most lawyering work. This limitation on tactics means that
the lawyer must look for other means of achieving client goals.

The main point of this Article is that these challenges the lawyer faces
when trying to serve her clients in advancing social change create
complexities for the lawyer that go beyond those which the traditional
lawyer faces when serving her client. Such complexities require
creativity to address them and to serve the client with zeal to achieve
the social change that will benefit that client. To what extent do the
common features of the examples of successful social change lawyering I
have provided here help chart a course for the social change lawyer? Do
the common characteristics of these examples of social change lawyering
offer techniques and tactics for bringing creativity to this work?

[While **iterative**, **incremental approaches** help advocates **hone
better ideas**, they also **advance the cause of social change** in a
**more just** and **democratic way** by **incorporating clients** in the
problem-solving effort. [Incremental approaches]{.mark} can]{.underline}
help to satisfy them, at least partially, on the way toward bringing
about the larger strategic measures that might ultimately lead to the
broader social change the lawyer seeks. Of course, some clients might
express frustration by the conservative nature of an incremental
approach, but incrementalism might turn out to serve the longer-term
goals of the client and the client's community better. Moreover, an
incremental, iterative approaches should include clients in the
inspiration and experimentation phases by consulting with them as the
lawyers and clients together determine the proper course of action. The
lawyer should **[engage]{.underline}** those [**clients** in developing
the experimental arguments that the lawyer may utilize, helping to
"**[crowdsource]{.mark}**" the [ideas]{.mark} that the lawyer will
promote, likely [**leading to better ideas**, but also
**investing**]{.mark} **the clients** [in the process]{.mark} itself,
**[giving]{.mark} them [confidence]{.mark}** that the lawyer is **taking
the client's problem seriously**]{.underline}.256 In addition, [the
lawyer can **balance the need for broader change** with
**addressing**]{.underline} the client's [**immediate needs through
[incremental measures]{.mark}** that are **designed to test ideas** that
can **build toward more wide ranging impacts** in a way that helps
**alleviate**]{.underline} the [**direct** and **immediate legal
needs**]{.underline} of the client. In this way, t[he lawyer
[can]{.mark} **use incrementalism** as a way to [**thread the needle**
between **broader**]{.mark} **social [change]{.mark}** [and
**meeting**]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}the [**[urgent needs]{.mark}**
of the client while]{.underline} she is **[waiting for]{.underline}**
that **[broader change to transpire]{.underline}**. The "test case"
model is a perfect example of this. [[A lawyer has]{.underline}]{.mark}
a client with [[facts that]{.mark} **serve to [exemplify the broader
problem]{.mark}**]{.underline} other clients and communities face,
[[but]{.underline}]{.mark} the lawyer **[[files a narrow
case]{.underline}]{.mark}** on that client's behalf [in the hope of
**[testing]{.mark} out**]{.underline} her
**[[arguments]{.underline}]{.mark}** on the courts, [hopefully [finding
ones that will **address**]{.mark}]{.underline} the client's
[[**immediate needs** while]{.mark} also [**garnering feedback** about
**what**]{.mark} **arguments [might resonate]{.mark}**]{.underline} with
the courts [should a **larger**, **more wide-ranging action
follow**]{.underline}.257

[[Incrementalism might]{.mark} also [serve as an]{.mark} **effective
[antidote to]{.mark} potential [backlash]{.mark}**: the **reversal of
victories** or an **erosion of rights** that might come [as
opponents]{.mark} are **[energized by]{.mark} their own
[losses]{.mark}** to **harness their own collective energy** and
**will** to take action to **[counteract]{.mark} the [strides]{.mark}**
made by the forces of social change. Taking [**small steps** allows the
community to]{.mark} begin to **[see]{.mark} what social [change]{.mark}
might look like**, **[experience it]{.mark}**, realize that the change
is itself **not all that different from the status quo**, [and]{.mark}
to **come to [accept]{.mark} that change** a small amount at a time. [As
**more people**]{.mark} **begin to [accept]{.mark} the change**, [even
if]{.mark} at a **[slow]{.mark} pace**, [it gives opponents]{.mark} of
the change [a **smaller base**]{.mark} **of support** when they begin to
mount their challenge to the change.]{.underline}

Another aspect of the creative social change lawyering described in Part
II is that each of the lawyers engaged in the exercise so critical to
lawyering generally and social change lawyering in particular: they
utilized their interpretive powers to reframe issues, often seizing on
the weaknesses of their opponents' position and exploiting them. For the
social change lawyer, her primary role in the context of efforts to
bring about such change is to serve as the translator of legal concepts
in ways that can support the social change she and her clients seek.
What makes this aspect of social change lawyering so creative is that
the lawyer often must face received wisdom and the controlling legal
narratives of dominant interpretations of the law that help to maintain
and preserve the status quo.258 Their dominance often leaves little room
for outsider perspectives on the law to convince decision makers of the
interpretation that the social change lawyer seeks. This is precisely
why social change lawyers often must attempt a reassessment of the
legal, sociological, ethical, moral, and factual bases and underpinnings
of their opponents' arguments. When faced with little room to maneuver,
and few options to make the affirmative case on their clients' behalf,
the creative lawyer can seek to encourage a reassessment of the support
of the opponents' position. And in order to carry out this reassessment
the lawyer deploys to tools of creativity described earlier,
particularly reframing.259

But does this type of reframing, and reimagining, help to overcome some
of the challenges the social change lawyer must overcome in pursuing
such change? One of the main uses of this type of reframing is that it
can often reaffirm the dignity of the community on whose behalf the
lawyer is advocating. In the marriage equality litigation, reframing the
issues helped to promote the interests of the LQBTQ community by
undermining the arguments of the marriage equality opponents. In so
doing, advocates destroyed the factual justifications for opposing
marriage equality and helped to fight the stigma those justifications
created. When marriage equality opponents said that heterosexual
marriage needed the endorsement of the state in order to ensure
procreation, marriage equality advocates argued that there were plenty
of heterosexual couples who could not procreate: should the state not
recognize their marriages then?260 When opponents argued that children
needed heterosexual couples to raise them, marriage equality advocates
presented overwhelming support for the proposition that children raised
in same-sex households fared the same as those in households headed by
heterosexual couples.261 Instead of further marginalizing and oppressing
their client communities, the reframing of the issues helped to reaffirm
the dignity of their LGBTQ clients and their families. Through creative
reframing, the lawyers were able to overcome obstacles to the social
change they sought, while also avoiding some of the deeper pitfalls of
social change lawyering.

Admittedly, this is not always the case. Indeed, the reframing carried
out by Benjamin Butler, when he called escaped slaves contraband, did
not sit well with abolitionists who thought Butler was accepting the
South's view of slaves as property too readily, and this reframing
undermined the efforts to recognize the humanity and dignity of the
slaves themselves, the very individuals Butler was trying to protect and
save. There is thus sometimes a risk that accepting the opponents'
position in an effort to undermine it can have the effect of further
marginalizing and demeaning the very clients the lawyer seeks to serve.
I do not know if anyone ever asked the escaped slave who presented
themselves on Fort Monroe in the early days of the war whether they
approved of Butler's tactics. My guess is, they preferred freedom, but
that is not to say that every interpretive act carried out by the social
change lawyer will always advance the client's interests, while also
reaffirming her basic dignity and humanity.262 Thus, while reframing can
offer social change lawyers an opportunity to advance their legal
position, the process of identifying those arguments to make, how and
when to make them, and to what ends, are issues that should always be
addressed in collaboration with the client and the community the lawyer
serves. That brings us back to the design thinking/incremental approach
described above. To the extent the interpretive strategies deployed by
the lawyer are carried out in collaboration with the client, it is
likely to yield better results that are reaffirming of the client and
effective in the course of the representation.

Similarly, by expanding the tools the lawyer uses to carry out these
interpretive functions, [the lawyer can create more creative strategies
by **developing an appreciation** for the ways in which the dominant
legal interpretation of particular social relations the lawyer is
challenging **cannot hold up** when assessed under the **scrutiny of
other disciplines**. By]{.underline} leaving the realm of law
altogether, and [**seeking out support** for one's position from **other
disciplines**, the social change lawyer is able to **overcome the
opponents' dominant position** and **undermine it** by looking at the
problem in **different ways**, from **different
perspectives**]{.underline}.263 [These different perspectives help to
**reveal the weaknesses**, **inconsistencies**, and **baselessness** of
the assumptions that **often underpin dominant narratives** and
**interpretations** of the law and social relations. By incorporating
insights from different disciplines in creative ways, the social change
lawyer **identifies flaws** in the dominant interpretation of the law
and the extent to which those flaws **often tend to find a basis in
unsupportable stereotypical** and **discriminatory
animus**]{.underline}. By bringing in perspectives from other
disciplines, [the lawyer can **reveal the narrowness** of the thinking
that supports the opponents' position and use those perspectives to
**advance a richer understanding** of the human experience and
**further**]{.underline} the **[social change]{.underline}** goals she
seeks.264

One way to further those goals in creative ways is to help the clients
and the communities the social change lawyers serves build power. [[A
**critical way** in which]{.underline}]{.mark} she helps those
[[communities build power is through]{.mark} **creative [coalition
building]{.mark}**. **[Central]{.mark}** to creative coalition building
[is]{.mark} the notion [that coalitions]{.mark} **often [form around
shared interests]{.mark}**, together [with **shared ways of viewing the
world**]{.mark}]{.underline}, which is sometimes referred to in the
social science literature as ["**[frame
alignment]{.mark}**."]{.underline}265 [The ability to **identify those
shared interests**---to **find opportunities** where interests
**converge** and **align**---requires **creativity**, an ability to
**sense opportunities for collaboration**, and to **craft [a]{.mark}
campaign's [message]{.mark}** in such a way [that]{.mark} it
[will]{.mark} [attract]{.mark} supporters from **[as wide a
section]{.mark} of the populace [as possible]{.mark}**. Such message
crafting [requires]{.mark} creativity, and a **sense of the needs** and
**interests of different sectors** of society. That **requires a
willingness [to seek out]{.mark}**[, **stay attuned to**, and **listen**
for]{.mark} opportunities [where]{.mark}]{.underline} one's clients'
[[interests]{.mark} will **[align with other]{.mark}
individual[s]{.mark}** and **groups** who might serve as potential
allies and supporters]{.underline}. In many ways, [the pursuit of such
potential allies requires]{.underline} the tools of creativity as well:
[an ability to **reframe ideas**, to **see things from different
perspectives**]{.underline}. In addition, [by **testing out theories
through [incremental steps]{.mark}**, the social change lawyer
[can]{.mark} begin to [**identify potential allies** and
**test**]{.mark} **out [new theories]{.mark}** [that]{.mark} might
[**bring new allies** in]{.mark}to the supportive fold]{.underline}. [An
example of this was the submission of an amicus brief filed on behalf of
the U.S. military's service academies]{.underline}266 [in support of the
**[University of Michigan]{.mark}** in defense of the use of racial
diversity in admissions decisions in Grutter v.
Bollinger]{.underline}267 [and Gratz v. Bollinger]{.underline}. 268 In
these ways, some of the components of the social change lawyering
described here can work together to identify and tap into where
interests converge.

### Hansen---Limits

#### Limits---

#### a) We control uniqueness, debate's [oversaturated]{.underline} with perspectives---preparing for this [inevitably]{.underline} requires filtering out arguments [whether we do it consciously or not]{.underline}---only a [mandated focus on controversy]{.underline} can [effectively narrow this down]{.underline}. There's no offense---it's T, [not framework]{.underline}---we're not a universal standard for every debater to meet, we're a [reasonable metric]{.underline} for [judging the deliberative value]{.underline} of speech acts---they can critique our interpretation, but they [can't win]{.underline} without a clearly-defined method of [assessing the relative worth of proposals]{.underline} under theirs.

**Hansen, 17**---Danish School of Media and Journalism (Ejvind, "Aporias
of courage and the freedom of expression," Philosophy & Social
Criticism, October 2, 2017, dml)

In the following we will pursue the idea that current discussions of the
(negative) freedom of expression should be supplemented with discussions
of how we achieve making the public spheres more open to courageous
truth-tellers. The main argument for going this way is a worry that
[with the **enormous growth** in the **number of those projecting their
expressions** into the public spheres]{.underline}, without a similar
growth in the span of attention, [we may end in a situation in which the
public exchanges become]{.underline} as **[ineffectual]{.underline}** as
in the pre-Enlightenment times[. It is]{.underline} thus [**necessary**
that we evaluate the public spheres **not only** in terms of their
permission for an **unlimited number of voices**, but also in terms of
the **mechanisms in place** that **allow attention to be attached** to
**courageous expressions**]{.underline}.

[The relationship between the **number of active participants** in
public sphere discourses and the **span of our attention** entails that
a **certain screening of information** and **expressions will happen
whether we do it actively or not**]{.underline}. The traditional idea of
the freedom of expression as just [the **absence of external
constraints** is]{.underline} thus in a certain sense [a **naïve
approach** to **achieve diverse public spheres** inasmuch as expression
**does not necessarily translate into discussion** or **any larger
social focus**]{.underline}.

The same applies to our suggestion based on both negative and positive
notions of freedom. [Even though we argue that public spheres that
**favour courageous truth-telling** are **democratically preferable to
those that do not**, to think of our argument as a **framework** to
**articulate some clearly defined criteria** that **must be met** by
discourse participants **misunderstands its nature**. Such
scenarios]{.underline}, as we know, [put the political order on a path
that **does not evoke pleasant historical memories**]{.underline}. On
the one hand, [our proposal is **mainly a suggestion** of **how to
assess the democratic worth of expressions** -- **certainly** there are
**other legitimate reasons** to participate in public
discussions]{.underline}. Second, [even for the evaluation of
the]{.underline} democratic [value]{.underline}, we will argue that [the
quest for courageous truth-telling functions as a **critical**,
**counterfactual ideal** -- an ideal that is **itself open for public
discussions**.]{.underline}

This is not to say that a counterfactual ideal is without actual
relevance in society. If [the]{.underline} suggested
[account]{.underline} of a positive freedom of expression is credible,
it [can serve as an **implicit reference** or **standard** from which to
**judge**]{.underline}, on the one hand, [**deliberative discussions of
actual expressions** in the public spheres and]{.underline}, second,
[**deliberations of the relationship** between **concrete**,
**prevailing interpretations** of the ideal and the actual
society]{.underline}.

[The main aim]{.underline} with the ideal [is thus **not to suggest a
norm** that **unequivocally determines whether or not actual expressions
are of democratic worth** in the public sphere. In order to have
practical worth the ideal **must**]{.underline}, admittedly, [be able to
**serve as a paradigm** for the **articulation of rules** and **values
against which actual expressions can be evaluated**]{.underline}. More
importantly, however, [the ideal is something that we **can**, and
**should**, **argue about**. If a speaker is **criticized for not being
a courageous truth-teller**,]{.underline} she or he [\[they\] can either
respond to the critique by showing that the expression is **actually
courageous according to the existing norms** for courage, or can
**challenge the norms as being inadequate**.]{.underline}

[This definitely opens the way to a **certain amount of unavoidable
relativism**, since the articulated ideals could **otherwise serve
repressive interests** by preventing expressions of views. The
relativism is, however, **conditional**. In the challenge of existing
norms of courage it will **still be necessary**, in order to be
**counted as a relevant voice**]{.underline} in the democratic public
sphere, [to **substantiate an alternative suggestion** as to **how the
notion of courage should be conceived**. In doing this, one will
**partake in a democracy-enhancing discussion**.]{.underline}

We will return to this discussion in section VI in which we argue that
on this aspect the deliberative understanding of communication and
democratic will formation (as articulated in Cohen, 1989, 1997;
Habermas, 1992, 1996; Rawls, 1999\[1971\]) bears some important
insights. Our account of deliberative reasoning is, however, furthermore
inspired by poststructuralist accounts in which it is taken seriously
that [deliberative exchanges]{.underline} to a large extent [**have to
focus on issues** that are **by their very nature impossible to agree
upon**]{.underline} -- [because the **crucial social challenges** are
**aporetic in nature** and thus any articulated account will be
inadequate. This is where ideals of courage come in, courageous
truth-telling being the practice of risking our lives in order to attain
some higher goal. The ideals of deliberation and courage indeed carry
some tensions]{.underline} (aporias), [but these tensions **should not
lead us to reject the ideals**]{.underline} -- the tension is, as it
were, a product of two mutually dependent and opposing ideals. In our
case [this will be a tension between the quest both for deliberative
consensus and courageous challenging]{.underline}. However, in order to
understand the structure of such paradoxes, we must turn our attention
to Derrida's notion of aporia.

#### b) Limits outweigh and turn case---rule-bounded debate is the only metric you have to fairly determine the winner, which is a prior concern to anything else you do with the ballot. Voting for disruption for its own sake when they don't have a broader vision for how to settle disputes achieves nothing more than trolling racists online---articulating a [vision for change]{.underline} and [defending it]{.underline} against [reasoned disagreement]{.underline} from a [well-prepared opponent]{.underline} is a [prerequisite]{.underline} to using the form of debate effectively, no matter what for.

**Hansen, 17**---Danish School of Media and Journalism (Ejvind, "Aporias
of courage and the freedom of expression," Philosophy & Social
Criticism, October 2, 2017, dml)

We can now return to the field of public exchanges. According to
Derrida, [courage carries the **aporia of death**: we are courageous if
we **risk life in order to be able to live** -- but a life lost is **not
worth living**. In the field of public exchanges this can be translated
into: expressions are **courageous** if the speaker **risks his or her
public life** -- i.e. if he or she brings out views that **radically
challenge existing horizons of exchange**. In doing so the speaker will
**risk losing his or her public reputation**. If this is **all that
happens**, the speaker '**dies**']{.underline} (and so does the message
-- 'Isaac') **[without having achieved his or her goal]{.underline}** (a
life lost is not worth living). Thus the paradox at the moral limit is
that [we need radical courage at the same time as courage needs to be
**moderated by the consideration of survival**. It is **not enough**
that we are **courageous** -- we need to be courageous in ways that
**actually achieve our goals**.]{.underline}

In a certain sense this aporia embodies a common experience that
[communicative exchanges are best if they **carry a certain amount of
disagreement** between the participants (otherwise they **cannot
challenge each other**), but without the disagreements becoming
**overwhelming** (because then exchanges **turn into
quarrels**]{.underline} -- elaborated in Hansen, 2009, 2011, 2015b).
When we analyse or assess actual public spheres [it is thus important
**not only to focus** upon the **plurality of voices** (because of our
**limited bandwidth of attention**). Plurality needs to be
**supplemented** with quests for radical courage that is
**moderated**]{.underline}. We will return to this in sections VI and
VII.

However, Derrida's point is opposite to Aristotle's: the mean challenge
is not the right solution to the aporia. In some cases we may have to
settle on some kind of mean between radicality and moderation; however,
at other points compromise-communication may in itself have become part
of the established normativity. In such cases courage calls for more
radical expressions.

To take an example: discussions of the freedom of expressions are often
summarized with the quote attributed to Voltaire: 'I disapprove of what
you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it' (actually
it was written by Evelyn Beatrice Hall in Tallentyre, 1906: 199 --
however, as a summary of Voltaire's general attitude at a certain
moment). Articulated as a statement in France in the 18th century it is
fair to consider it as a radical moderation: to allow a public existence
of unethical, dangerous or false statements was quite radical at the
peak of Enlightenment cultures in which censorship was not all that
uncommon. In some situations it probably still is.

At the same time, however, in other situations the quest for tolerance
can itself become a public dogma used to de-legitimize or at least
reduce voices of critique. Hardt and Negri have argued that
power-holders in modern societies increasingly use the ability of
cultures to contain critique as a mechanism to fortify the existing
power structures (Hardt and Negri, 2000: ch. 2.4; Hardt and Negri, 2009:
ch. 2.3). So, even though the saying attributed to Voltaire at first
sight makes room for disagreement and critique, in a second step it
actually also reduces the relevance of the other: 'I disagree with you,
but I don't have to respond to your critique, because our culture is
strong enough to be able to carry and contain differences.'

Furthermore, it may be argued that certain interpretations of the quest
for tolerance, on the other hand, leave room open for recent public
developments of 'post-truth' and 'fake news' (which means the use of
expressions with very vague, alternative or even false references to
truth claims are used to de-rail public discussions) because they need
to be tolerated too. In Hansen (2015a) I thus argue that it is important
that public expressions too are evaluated as to their commitment to some
shareable account of truth.

To summarize: even though we grant that the Voltaire/Hall statement in a
previous historical situation was an important radical challenge (if we
cannot reach an agreement, then we must settle on agreeing to disagree)
tolerance in historical situations coming after it and influenced by it
may become a way to escape challenges put forward in the public sphere
by shifting the focus to the issue of tolerance instead of the content
of the disagreement. The saying embodies a compromise -- but a
compromise that should itself continuously be challenged by new radical
challenges in order not to lose its public relevance.

VI

Derrida's voice in the previous section certainly embodies a disruptive
impulse in public cultures. In his reading, the aporia of courage calls
for continuous challenges of existing structures. He is, however, on the
other hand quite aware that this impulse leads to both responsibility
and irresponsibility (cf. the quote above), and according to the
deconstructive approach no destruction is possible without a
construction. Justice is not possible without the laws and norms of
right; [**challenges to existing rules** and **norms** are **not
courageous in themselves**. In the public spheres there are **numerous
examples** of expressions that **challenge prevailing norms** and
**rules**, **trolls** that **obstruct ongoing communicative expressions
without necessarily being courageous**]{.underline}. We will in this
section seek to explain the moral status of the notion of courage by
looking at two ways courage can be said to operate in the public
spheres. On the one hand, [the **mere challenge** is **not enough** to
**establish the courageousness** of the interlocutor]{.underline}.
Second, [the **aims** or **goals** of the acts are **constituent of the
degree** to which a gesture is courageous]{.underline}.

In order to see that the mere challenge is not enough for an act to be
courageous we can think of the recent emergence of trolls in Internet
communication (Hardaker, 2010; Binns, 2012). [Trolls specialize in
**disruptive** and **non-constructive interferences** in discussions
through **expressions of outrageous views**. Their practices **should
not**]{.underline}, however, [**be called courageous** because they **do
not actually risk any reputational capital**]{.underline} (at least to
the extent that the anonymity measures are effective).

Second, however, [the notion of courage]{.underline}, as Aristotle
noticed, [is **more than mere challenge** and the **risking of life** --
the notion of courage also carries an implication of **fighting for
something**]{.underline}. Aristotle distinguished foolhardiness from
courage. For instance, [to go to war unarmed against an armed enemy is
**foolhardy**]{.underline}. There are many instances where **[lack of
preparation]{.underline}** or foresight, or emotional acting out,
**[vitiate the bravery of the action]{.underline}**.

[In order for a practice to be courageous there **needs to be some kind
of goal**, and]{.underline}, furthermore, [**some kind of connection**
between the **goal** and the **practice**]{.underline}. This is
admittedly still pretty vague. Insofar as we define courage as a
challenging practice in which we risk our lives in order to reasonably
further some kind of goal, we have reached a definition with elements
('risk', 'lives', 'reasonably' 'further', 'some kind of goal') that are
very open to differing views.

On the one hand, this is certainly as it has to be. If we are to
articulate a positive supplement to the negative definitions of the
freedom of expression, it must be very open, because it should be open
to the improvisational and disruptive impulses of courage. As soon as we
start to define the goals and the ways of reaching them too strictly,
these very definitions might themselves become objects of challenge
through the aporias of courage.

On the other hand, [even though the]{.underline} positive [freedom we
are seeking to instantiate is **open to differing views**, this **does
not mean** that we **might as well do without it** -- **especially not**
when we are talking about **communicative expressions**]{.underline}. It
draws on the intuition that [life at the outset is the **prime value**,
and if you **risk your life** you are thus **expected to be able to say
something** about why this sacrifice is necessary. The
agent]{.underline} who risks her or his life **[always has the burden of
proof]{.underline}**.

Certainly, [what is taken to be necessary may **vary almost
endlessly**]{.underline}. That cannot be determined in advance, once and
for all. [But an agent who risks her or his life **without being able to
give some account of why**, is **foolhardy** -- and the chances that she
or he in some sense will be **taken seriously** is
**minimal**]{.underline}.

With this last move, we are, as premised above, closing in on a
deliberative approach (as articulated in Cohen, 1989, 1997; Habermas,
1981, 1992, 1996; Rawls, 1999\[1971\]), something that may seem
surprising given the French inspiration of the previous sections.
Knowing Habermas' hostility towards the anti-rational impulses in these
positions (Habermas, 1985) on the one hand, and Derrida's hesitation on
linguistic generality (cf. the previous sections) on the other hand,
this calls for some comments.

We are not going to claim that the Habermasian and Derridean approaches
could be reconciled. In previous writings we have, however, argued that
Habermas' deliberative approach and the world-disclosing approaches (in
this article: Foucault and Derrida) articulate two different (and to
some extent opposing) impulses in our social, political and
communicative practices: the impulses of systematicity (attempting to
bring together seemingly disparate phenomena) and the quest for adequacy
(attempting to understand phenomena in their entire diversity) (e.g. in
Hansen, 2005a, 2005b, 2013).

As shown above, Derrida's [deconstructive approach]{.underline} can
certainly be seen as an attempt [to]{.underline} reveal the necessary
gaps and aporias embodied in the generalizing aspects in argumentative
[deliberation]{.underline}. At the same time, however, the findings of
his analyses **[do not lead to a refusal of the generalizing
approaches]{.underline}** as such:

[The undecidable]{.underline} is not merely the oscillation or the
tension between two decisions; it [is the experience of that
which]{.underline}, [though]{.underline} heterogeneous, [foreign
to]{.underline} the order of the calculable and [the rule, is **still
obliged**]{.underline} -- it is of obligation that we must speak -- [to
**give itself up to the impossible decision**, while **taking account
of**]{.underline} law and **[rules]{.underline}**. (Derrida, 1994: 539;
emphases added)

Even though Derrida in the above quote is reflecting upon the
undecidable and the moment of freedom he still acknowledges that [the
**resulting decision needs to take account of laws** and
**rules**]{.underline}. Derrida is very clear that [**true decisions**
are **not determined by existing rules**]{.underline} and laws, [but
**at the same time**]{.underline}, however, [**neither** are they
**entirely independent of rules**]{.underline} and laws.

Habermas and Derrida certainly disagree in their analyses of how rules
and laws are (should be) established -- Derrida focusing on emergence
through continuous challenges, Habermas focusing on the deliberative and
argumentative trying to overcome mutual disagreements. Habermas' account
has its limits when it comes to articulating reasonable resentments
towards existing discursive structures (this is an often raised
criticism of Habermas' approach -- see, for example, in Thomassen,
2007), Derrida's approach is lacking in reflections on the forces or
mechanisms that bring back new accounts of the general: how and why do
new rules, laws and accounts of courage come about?

Both positions are (if not in their full articulations then at least in
their founding intuitions) in fact right. [In order for deconstruction
**not to become merely destructive**, we need to understand how reason
in communication plays the role of **helping agents to reach reasonably
towards each other**. Otherwise public discussions will tend to
**dissolve into an infinite ocean of unconnected conversations**; **any
point of view** will appear as **equally valid**; **any decision will be
prevented** by the **persistent possibility of raising counter-voices**
by minority groups. Deliberation is the responsibility of trying to
**reach common understandings in spite of initial
disagreements**]{.underline}. This is where Habermas is right. On the
other hand, in order for such reasonable accounts not to freeze into
dogma, we need (courageous) challenges of the very accounts of
reasonability. This is where world-disclosing approaches as suggested by
Foucault and Derrida are at their strongest.

However, having seen that every human practice is embedded in aporetic
paradoxes, it should not come as a surprise that even reason is
aporetically structured: seeking deliberative consensus is a legitimate
aim only insofar as the exchanged arguments seek to include courageous
challenges (possible disturbances of consensus) of the discursive
horizons, just as we have seen that notions of courage make sense only
through some deliberative reflections of our means and goals.

[The quest for a **reasonable account** of the necessity of change
**does not imply** that]{.underline} (1) [an act without such accounts
is **by itself illegitimate** -- sometimes we do things **without any
reason** or **clear ideas** of what we try to accomplish that turn out
to be of value nevertheless. But in **public exchanges where we want to
affect others**, the others should **in some way come to understand why
change is necessary**.]{.underline}

[Neither do we want to imply that]{.underline} (2) [changes **may never
come about** without agents being able themselves to give an account of
why this is necessary. Quite often actions and events are conceived in
ways that the initiators did not foresee.]{.underline}

What we are trying to argue here is thus not that the suggested
reflections on positive freedom of expression should replace prevailing
accounts of negative freedom. It may be argued that a freedom of
expression that is only thought through negative accounts of freedom is
problematic, but that is quite another argument and it is not implied by
the above reflections. The reflections merely suggest that [in
**evaluations of actual public spheres** it is **inadequate merely to
consider the plurality of voices**]{.underline} (as suggested in the
negatively conceived accounts of the freedom of expression).

This is where we suggest turning our attention towards notions of
courage. [If our **bandwidth of attention is limited**, it is
**important** that **we in our engagements**]{.underline} in the public
spheres [are **not overwhelmed** by **insignificant utterances** that
**merely affirm existing states of affairs**. For public deliberation to
become **democratically fruitful** it is important that we are
**attentive to courageously challenging statements**; challenges that
are]{.underline}, certainly, [**made comprehensible to us** by the
speakers' **attempts to convince us** of the **underlying goals** and
**means**.]{.underline}

Certainly, [if these reflections are to **gain any real relevance** they
will need to be **further articulated**, and in such articulations it
will be **necessary to substantiate notions** of '**life**',
**'reasonably**', '**some kind of goal**', etc. And these
substantiations might **narrow the plurality of voices heard** in the
public]{.underline}.

As demonstrated in the previous sections [the **alternative** to doing
this is]{.underline}, however, [**not to make every voice visible** in
the public spheres. Even though they may exist in the public sphere, it
is **not certain** that the **limited bandwidth of attention** leaves
room for their **actually being heard** by **any critical
mass**.]{.underline}

Insofar as we consider the public spheres not merely as spheres in which
voices should be uttered but also as spheres in which voices should be
heard, [we need **some way to select out those voices** from the chorus
that are **significant in relation to some given context**. **Unlimited
plurality is not an option**. The question]{.underline} thus [becomes
**how plurality should be limited**. Should plurality be limited
according to **explicitly articulated rules** and **norms**, rules and
norms that can, **due to their explicit articulations**, themselves
become **subjects of dispute**? Or should plurality be limited according
to **unconscious power structures**, the **rules of the
strongest**?]{.underline}

### Hvidsten---Testing

#### Debatability outweighs---[shared understanding]{.underline} of the [conceptual horizons]{.underline} of the topic allows us to work out [internal contradictions]{.underline} and achieve [higher levels of understanding]{.underline}---that's a [prerequisite]{.underline} to the capacity to [critique societal norms and]{.underline} institutions in the first place. There's no offense, it's T, [not framework]{.underline}---we're [agnostic]{.underline} about content because entering in debate means [accepting you could be wrong]{.underline}---but the [form]{.underline} of debate demands a [common criterion for internal coherence]{.underline} that alternative roles for the ballot make [impossible]{.underline}. 

**Hvidsten, 18**---PhD Fellow, ‎Department of Political Science,
University of Oslo (Andreas, "Arguing with the enemy: A dialectical
approach to justifying political liberalism," Philosophy & Social
Criticism, April 10, 2018, dml) \[gendered language modifications
denoted by brackets\]

[Deciding between competing understandings of the same issue through
reasoning **necessitates**]{.underline} a good deal of [**common
understanding**. This common ground is partly epistemological---an
(implicit or explicit) **consensus** on **what counts as good reasons**,
**valid arguments**, and so forth---and partly in the form of some
**overlap in conceptual horizons**: the **fundamental categories**
through which the issue is understood]{.underline}.

Philosophers have used different terms for this conceptual horizon, such
as "background" (Searle 1995, chap. 6), "paradigm" (Kuhn 2012, chap. 2),
"inescapable framework" (Taylor 1989, chap. 2), or "world view" (Weber
2004, 103). Regardless of the particular term one prefers, the main
point---now ubiquitous in modern philosophy---is that we human beings
inescapably relate to the world, to ourselves, and to others through
conceptual lenses of which we might be more or less conscious.

Kuhn, famously, pointed out that [even when we seemingly have an
external standard of reference]{.underline}, such as when observing
physical objects, [we **still rely on a shared conceptual framework in
order to agree**]{.underline} on what we are seeing: "[a paradigm is
**prerequisite to perception itself**]{.underline}" (Kuhn 2012, 113).
Kuhn's scientific paradigms are but one example of a general phenomenon
that extends also to political philosophy and ideology. Before Kuhn,
Karl Mannheim, known as the founder of the sociology of knowledge,
argued that [having different ideologies]{.underline}---being, say, a
liberal, a Marxists or a fascist---[amounted to **comprehending the
world very differently**, even **incompatibly**]{.underline} (Mannheim
1997). [Ideological divisions]{.underline}, Mannheim argued, [reached
**all the way down** to the **very meaning of words**]{.underline}.

Just as a Aristotelian and a Newtonian physicist would not mean the same
thing when speaking of "force"---and a Newtonian and an Einsteinian
physicist would not mean the same thing when speaking of "space" and
"time"---a liberal and a Marxist would not mean the same thing when
speaking of concepts like "liberty."8 A Lockean liberal for whom
"private property is \[...\] the natural expression and realization
\[...\] of individual freedom" (Scruton 2017)---and who sees the chief
end of political society to protect that property (Locke 2009,
97)---might find it absurd to learn that Marxists envision a society
without private property as the final emancipation of man.9

The issue, of course, is that word the "liberty" has different meanings
and different relations to other values in different political
philosophies and ideologies. It is not the case that liberals believe in
liberty and Marxists believe in something else. It was not freedom that
Marx sought to abolish but the oppression of the working class, which,
according to him, was ideologically justified by "bourgeois" concepts of
freedom, such as we find in Locke and in the liberal constitutions in
Marx' own time (see e.g. Marx 1994: 17--20).

Real freedom, Marxists have always argued, is economic freedom, which,
for classical Marxism/socialism at least, rests on ownership of the
means of production. Consequently, universal emancipation means
communism and collective ownership of land, factories, and
resources---the exact opposite of the liberal conclusion. Obviously, [if
a **consensus on fundamental political principles** is ever to be
obtained]{.underline} among liberals and Marxists, [a **consensus of
meaning** must be established **first**]{.underline}. (And foreshadowing
a second point: [such a consensus would **change the ideological
positions involved**, insofar as the content of an ideology is partly
defined by the **meaning of its central concepts**]{.underline}.)

[That people use the same word to mean different things in political
discourse obviously makes communication difficult, but I would contend
that the fact that **everybody claims to be the proper interpreters of
the same values**]{.underline} such as "freedom" [actually carries a
**good deal of hope**. This **transforms** at least some **political
value conflicts** into **conceptual conflicts**. And if we can translate
(at least some of) our **fundamental ideological differences** into
**conceptual issues**, then we can potentially **handle these difference
within the domain of reason**.]{.underline}

Dialectical argument

What I have portrayed above would be a case of what Mouffe calls a
"conflictual consensus"---"consensus on \[...\] ethico-political values
\[...\], dissent about their interpretation" (Mouffe 2005, 121)---which
is a form of "agonistic" relation that a democracy is supposed to be
able to handle. How, however, should we handle them? [If we want to
**handle**]{.underline} such [**disagreement through reasoning** and
**deliberation**]{.underline}, the circumstance [that we **lack a
consensus on meaning** is an obvious obstacle. **How can we talk to each
other** if we **use words differently**? And in what sense can
we]{.underline} really be said to **[have a consensus]{.underline}** on,
say, the importance of human liberty [if we have **deeply conflictual
interpretations**]{.underline} of "human liberty"---[especially when
these differing interpretations translate into **radically different
visions** for political society?]{.underline}

It seems that [focusing **less** on the **expression of values** and
**more** on their **interpretation**]{.underline}---less on the use of
words, such as "liberty," "equality," and "democracy," and more on the
meanings of those words---[could be **fruitful**. Once we realize that
these political values are **conceptualized very differently in
different ideologies**, we **can no longer take their meaning as
self-evident**. This circumstance **necessitates
self-reflection**---"**reasoning through cross-examination** and the
**constant repositioning of one's thought**"]{.underline} (Brincat 2014,
590)---[which is the **driving force of dialectical
argument**.]{.underline}

[Most theoretical positions have **internal inconsistencies** or
**contradictions**]{.underline} as they are often referred to in
dialectical parlance (we will find such contradictions in both
liberalism and Islamism in the next section), [which often come to light
**only when confronted with alternative ways of
thinking**]{.underline}.10 [The working out of these contradictions
usually has a **transformative effect**. At the end of a **truly
dialectical process**, **neither side** rarely find themselves in the
**exact same theoretical position** they had at the beginning.
**Conversion** is]{.underline}, of course, [a possibility---so is
**synthesis**. At the very least one can expect **more robust versions**
of the original positions, even]{.underline} perhaps amounting to [**new
positions**, insofar as **fundamental parts** of one's conceptual
apparatus may have been **altered in the process**]{.underline}.

The possibility of progress in political--philosophical argument

A crucial premise for dialectic reasoning is that [reasoning, if done
properly, can move subjects not only towards a **common understanding**,
but also]{.underline}---as an integral part of that process---[from
**lower** to **higher levels** of understanding. A higher level of
understanding entails a **better grasp of issues** that **could not be
properly dealt with** within a **lower-level paradigm**]{.underline}.
One example from the natural sciences is how Einsteinian physics---the
higher-level position in this example---can account for the
discrepancies in the orbit of Mercury that Newtonian physics---the
lower-level position---could not account for, by changing the
fundamental conceptual apparatus of physics.11

When comparing positions in political philosophy, the situation is more
complicated than in the case of physics in (at least) two important
ways. First, in the Einstein--Newton example there exists [a **clear
criteria**, **common to both paradigms**, can serve as an
"**umpire**"]{.underline} in Gaus' terms, namely the purpose and
principles of physics itself. Neither Einstein nor Newton, presumably,
would dispute that part of the purpose of physics is to account for the
movement of planetary bodies, and that any theoretical innovation that
allowed for a better account of this movement, without sacrificing
(indeed, in Einstein's case improving) explanatory power in other areas,
would constitute an advance.

Second, paradigms in physics are directed towards a physical reality
that, in the long run at least, serves as [an arbiter that **rewards
good theories** and **punishes faulty theories**]{.underline}. Political
philosophy works rather differently. How to best conceptualize "space"
and "time" will have to be worked out through combining reasoning and
experimentation, but there is no scientific experiment that can be run
to decide on the best conceptualization of "freedom." When it comes to
conceptual disagreements in political philosophy, reason has to carry
the burden on its own. Thus, any progressive development in political
philosophy will primarily be an internal movement in reason itself. The
dialectical expression of this would be that the relation between a
higher and a lower level of understanding in political philosophy is
such that the higher-level position understands---not some external
reality---but the lower-level position better than the lower-level
position understands itself (Skjervheim 1996, 274).

That it is possible to gain understanding in political philosophy such
that one might conceivably at some point in a larger process of
intellectual maturation look back at previous positions one used to hold
as inadequate in comparison to the position one now holds, is, I would
think, uncontroversial. The first complication, then, seems more urgent
to address. [Do we have a]{.underline} (or several) **[dialectical
yardstick]{.underline}**(s) of progress in political philosophy as we
arguably have in physics? Do we have [a set of criteria rooted **not in
a particular**]{.underline} political--philosophical
**[position]{.underline}**, but in the very purpose of political
philosophy itself, [that **might serve as a common standard** for this
practice]{.underline}? Perhaps we do.

I began this essay by connecting political philosophy to the idea of
political legitimacy. [The purpose]{.underline} of political philosophy,
I claimed, [is to **establish the contours of the politically
legitimate**: **what can be justified** as **just**, **fair**,
**reasonable**, and **right** when it comes to **political
institutions** and **practices**. Even if **particular ideas** about
what is just, fair, reasonable, and right are **likely to be
contested**, it is **difficult to contest** the **very ambition of
justifying political institutions** and **practices in the first
place**]{.underline}. Indeed, I would like to entertain the notion that
[abandoning this ambition in political philosophy is like **abandoning
the ambition of explaining physical phenomenon in physics**---it would
mean, in effect, **abandoning the practice itself**.]{.underline}

[**Everyone who argues from** and **for a political--philosophical
position**]{.underline}---be it liberalism, Marxism, Islamism, or any
other "ism"---[has, **regardless of any other disagreements** they might
have, **implicitly** or **explicitly agreed** that political
institutions and practices **should be justified**; that these
institutions and practices should be **backed by argument** and not
simply by force]{.underline}. Even the most hard-nosed political
realists who believe the Hobbesian dictum that "before the names of
Just, and Unjust can have place, there must be some coercive Power"
(Hobbes 2012, 66) cannot completely escape justification. They too feel
the need to argue the supposed futility of political argument and its
surrender to power, which then turns into an (implicit) justification of
any political order as long as it is powerful enough.

[This **commitment to justification**]{.underline}, then, [can form a
**criterion of internal coherence**]{.underline} of a
political--philosophical position: [does the position accommodate the
demands that justification]{.underline}, and therefore political
philosophy itself, [places upon us?]{.underline} The specification of
these demands and the answer to this question will be crucial components
of this justificatory strategy in practice.

One way to cash this out is to consider the implicit assumption about
human nature involved in the claim that political institutions and
practices should not merely exist, but also be justified. This is
actually, I would contend, a very specific claim about human liberty.
First, it is a claim that [institutions and practices are, **in some
form**, under our **collective control**]{.underline}; that [the
**laws**, **rules**, and **norms** that govern these institutions and
practices are **social constructs** that can **sensibly be critiqued**
and **not immutable natural laws**]{.underline} (which, of course,
cannot be sensibly critiqued in the same way). Second, [it is a claim
that that **such critique is possible**; that the individual human being
**in some way** is **ontologically detached** from]{.underline} his
[\[their\] political (and social) surroundings in such a way
that]{.underline} he or she is [\[they are\] **capable of taking a
critical stance** towards those surroundings.]{.underline} In short:

The practice of political philosophy is built a liberal concept of human
freedom as a private sphere for reflection of self-definition---which is
the basis for, among other things, adopting an autonomous stance on
political arrangements. Only against this background understanding of
human freedom does the practice of philosophy and the BLD become
sensical.

If the above claim is true, then non-liberal political philosophy, that
is, political philosophy that does not put the individual's autonomy at
its core, is not only anti-liberal but anti-philosophy. Or to put it
another way: non-liberal political philosophy is, in the last instance,
incompatible with political philosophy itself. As such, [Marx'
admonition to **stop philosophizing** and **start acting**---to **stop
interpreting the world** and **start changing it**---is a **perfectly
coherent part** of his **attack on the**]{.underline} bourgeois--liberal
**[state]{.underline}**. In a liberal state, philosophy, insofar as it
is aware of its own conditions of possibility at least, is a
conservative force. Abolishing liberalism means abolishing philosophy
(or at least curtailing it), as indeed totalitarian states usually
do---sometimes, perversely, in the name of "freedom."

Of course, the liberal concept of freedom could be accepted as a
condition for political philosophy and yet devalued in particular
political--philosophical positions. Human liberty (in the liberal sense)
could be recognized as real, but not worthy of political protection and
nourishment. Would this make the particular political--philosophical
position theoretically incoherent? Perhaps not, but I would argue that
maintaining such a position would make the practice of political
philosophizing incoherent, in the sense that it would undermine its own
foundation. [To **politically argue against the conditions of
possibility of political argument** is to **rebel against the project of
political philosophy** no less than to abandon the quest for explaining
physical phenomena is to **rebel against the project of
physics**.]{.underline}

### Manin---Clash

#### Debate is [distinct]{.underline} from discussion due to its [adversarial nature]{.underline}---we control uniqueness and the internal link is linear, multiple factors predispose us to avoiding clash, so you should seek to guarantee it as much as possible---the mere presence of limits or concessionary ground lapse into [confirmation bias]{.underline} at best and [mutual ignorance]{.underline} at worst. Centering debate on the [instrumental consequences]{.underline} of the 1AC's proposal solves.

**Manin, 17**---Professor of Politics, NYU (Bernard, "Political
Deliberation & the Adversarial Principle," Daedalus, Volume 146, Issue
3, Summer 2017, p.39-50, dml)

Let us begin with improving the quality of collective decisions. A long
tradition of thought, including, in particular, the reflections of John
Stuart Mill and Karl Popper, has highlighted what we can call the
epistemic virtues of criticism. Several arguments have shown that [to
submit an idea to criticism constitutes one of the **best means of
testing its validity**]{.underline}. This holds for practical ideas. [A
decision is **more likely** to be of a **high quality** -- whether in
**factual** and **technical terms**, or in terms of **values** -- if
**the proposals for action** have been **submitted to criticism
beforehand**. Criticism permits the **elimination**, or at least the
**reduction**, of proposals involving **false factual beliefs**,
**logical errors**, or **objectionable moral choices**]{.underline}. We
do not need to repeat here the arguments establishing the epistemic
merits of criticism. No one today would deny that criticism is one of
the best means at our disposal to test the quality, technical and moral,
of practical proposals. Nevertheless, [the conclusion that we
**generally draw** from these arguments is that it is enough **simply to
establish the freedom to express criticism** to produce its
benefits]{.underline}. This is without doubt how Mill reasoned. We find
an even more striking expression of this position in the famous
free-speech dissent of Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes. Men,
he wrote, will eventually realize "that the ultimate good desired is
better reached by free trade in ideas -- that the best test of truth is
the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of
the market."7 [Yet the conclusion that the free exchange of ideas is a
sufficient guarantee is **not justified**. Freedom of speech on its own
**does not ensure** that the **right to criticize** will be
exercised]{.underline}. Furthermore, as we shall see, [the fact that
criticisms are put forward **does not guarantee** that they will
**receive proper consideration**]{.underline}. Several mechanisms can
prevent the ability to criticize freely from leading to its exercise. I
group these together here under the label of conformism. Social
psychology has long told us (with elaboration in Rousseau) that people
want to be liked. Being esteemed and approved of by others also provides
a gratifying image of one\'s self. It follows that when people perceive
that, in a given social environment, others\' opinions lean in a certain
direction, they tend to bend their own expressions in the same direction
to gain the approval of their peers. They avoid expressing dissenting or
critical views, reinforcing the mechanism of the "spiral of silence."8
Even in the context of discussion, we observe the disposition to conform
to what is perceived as the norm within the group. This phenomenon is at
the heart of what has been named, since the works of psychologist Serge
Moscovici, the polarizing effect of group discussions.9 Thus, even if
criticism is formally free, a powerful social force works to
marginalize, or even to stifle, its expression. Contrary to what liberal
theorists often affirm, social or cultural [diversity within a group
**does not suffice** to assure a confrontation of opinions **critically
opposed to one another**. Suppose, for example, a deliberating body
whose members, **while being diverse** with regard to social position,
education, and beliefs, also **share a fear of some
danger**]{.underline}. Let us imagine, furthermore, that this assembly
discusses a measure that would contribute to the reduction of this
danger; for example, strengthening the powers of the police. [In this
context, it is **unlikely** that collective deliberation will **bring
forth many arguments against the adoption** of this measure, **however
much social** or **cultural diversity** there may be in the
group]{.underline}. Rather, the discussion will produce an accumulation
of reasons in favor of increased police power, with various members
finding, from within their own particular perspectives, diverse reasons
for adopting this course of action that others, differently situated,
may not have seen on their own. Yet even if increasing the prerogatives
of the police did, in fact, contribute to the realization of the desired
end, [the measure might also **present undesirable effects** or
**features** in other ways. Collective deliberation should **precisely
bring to light these potential negative effects** and **weigh them in
the balance against the benefits** of the measure]{.underline}. But in
our case, the assembly will systematically underestimate these possible
negative features even though members of the assembly have the liberty
to oppose the measure and criticize one another. It appears, then, that
[if one wants to obtain from political deliberation the **favorable
epistemic effects of criticism**, the expression of opposing opinions
**must be encouraged**, **not merely permitted**]{.underline}. But there
is another reason to ensure that the participants in a deliberation are
actually confronted with opposing points of view; it concerns the
reception of arguments, rather than their production. Studies in social
and cognitive psychology show that, confronted with new information or
evidence, people have a systematic propensity to see in it a
confirmation of their previous beliefs. In a now-classic experiment,
psychologists presented the same ensemble of documents and studies
concerning the death penalty and its effects to two groups of subjects
selected on the basis of their antecedent opinions: one group composed
of subjects favorable to the death penalty, the other subjects who are
rather hostile to it. After being confronted with these documents, the
group that was favorable to the death penalty became more favorable to
it, and the group hostile to it became still more hostile.10 This
phenomenon is particularly marked when the documents presented to the
subjects were ambiguous and called for interpretation. The propensity to
find support for one\'s antecedent beliefs is known as "confirmation
bias."11 Research has also shown that group discussion reinforces the
effects of confirmation bias. Groups interpret information with more
bias than do individuals; and they privilege information that supports
their antecedent beliefs to an even greater degree than do
individuals.12 Two mechanisms explain this tendency. First, as noted
earlier, group settings accentuate tendencies that predominate among
individuals. If privileging information supportive of prior beliefs is
already the dominant tendency among individuals, it is not surprising
that this tendency should be amplified in group discussion. But a
second, and more surprising, mechanism is also at work. It seems that
groups tend to discuss principally the information that was already
known to all the members before the beginning of the discussion. Within
groups, it turns out, discussion turns essentially on shared knowledge.
Members of the group are reluctant to discuss those bits of information
that are known only to one or a few other members prior to the
discussion.13 Shared information appears to have more weight in the eyes
of the group members, and has a greater chance of being mentioned during
the discussion, and thus remembered later.14 Finally, information
supporting the position preferred by the greatest number of group
members has a greater likelihood of becoming the object of discussion
than information supporting the contrary position.15 Collective
discussion thus tends to produce a disproportionate volume of
information and arguments in favor of the already-dominant belief in the
group. [If one wishes to check the effects of **confirmation
bias**]{.underline} -- a phenomenon to which groups are particularly
vulnerable -- [one must take **proactive measures**. One
can]{.underline}, for example, [**call special attention to arguments
contrary to prior beliefs** by]{.underline} highlighting them
(literally) or by [making them **cognitively more salient**. Not only is
the free expression of a multiplicity of voices **not sufficient** to
assure the **confrontation of opposing views**, but the **mere
expression of contrary arguments** is **not sufficient** for others to
**understand those arguments** or **consider them
objectively**]{.underline}. [In the absence of measures that **actively
induce individuals** to pay particular attention to **evidence** and
**points of view opposed to their own**, collective deliberation will
have the **greatest likelihood** of simply **reinforcing antecedent
opinions**. In a political deliberation]{.underline}, in short, [we
**cannot expect** that the gathering of diverse points of view will
**spontaneously produce a clash of arguments pro** and **contra**, nor
that it will **bring about a balanced consideration of
views**]{.underline}. Mill was [wrong to assume that, in a society or an
assembly composed of diverse members, opposing opinions would **already
be there**, **waiting to be set against one another** once they were
**allowed to be uttered**]{.underline}. Mill wrote: "The most intolerant
of churches, the Roman Catholic Church, even at the canonization of a
saint, admits, and listens patiently to, a 'devil\'s advocate.\'"16 He
failed to see that [the **presence of a devil\'s advocate was
required**, not **merely admitted**]{.underline}. And through [the
requirement]{.underline}, the Church [**secured** that
objections]{.underline} to the canonization of a given person [were
**aired** and **considered**, even if no individual would otherwise have
spontaneously offered them]{.underline}.17 [The confrontation of
opposing opinions also has merit beyond eliciting unshared perspectives.
It **unifies the field** in which opinions are formed and expressed,
**counteracting the fragmentation** of the public sphere. In order to be
**opposed to an opinion** and to **contest it**, it is **necessary**
that one be **cognizant** of that opinion and **take it into
consideration**. In a society in which points of view are objectively
diverse, the **open** and **explicit clash** of opposing ideas is
neither the **natural state** nor the **sole possible condition**.
Another configuration is **just as likely**: **mutual
ignorance**]{.underline}. The German sociologist Georg Simmel therefore
argued that conflict between social groups paradoxically served the
cause of social integration: first, by placing the conflicting groups
into a relationship with one another and, second, by exerting a pressure
for unity among the secondary divisions within each group. We can
advance a similar argument in matters of opinion. [The clash of opinions
**unifies the field** in which beliefs confront one another, **creating
a space** in which those beliefs are **addressed to** and **respond to
one another**. This task of mutual addressing is **harder** when the
space of opinions is **fragmented**]{.underline} into a multitude of
islets, homogenous within themselves but formed [in conditions of
**little communication** with outsiders]{.underline}. [Several
factors]{.underline} -- some older, some of more recent origin -- [now
**trend in the direction** of this sort of fragmentation]{.underline}.
First, we have long known that [people are **selective** in their choice
of contacts and social relations. They **tend disproportionately** to be
in contact with people who **share their political
opinions**]{.underline}.18 Psychologically, [many **fear the
face-to-face expression** of political disagreement and **want to avoid
it as much as possible**]{.underline}. [More recent factors also work in
the direction of fragmentation: the development of **cable
television**]{.underline} and its thematic stations, [the spread of the
**Internet**, and]{.underline} finally the movement toward
[**residential** and **territorial segregation**]{.underline}. Although
the effects of these transformations are still difficult to estimate,
they all present an analogous structure: [people are now offered, in
multiple ways, greater opportunities for communicating and coming into
contact **only with other individuals like themselves**]{.underline}.
Cable television and the rise of opinion-based television stations (a
phenomenon currently more pronounced in the United States than in
Europe) provide viewers with the possibility of receiving a high
proportion of their information only from a channel to which they feel
ideologically close. Worse still, cable TV allows individuals with
little interest in politics to avoid political news altogether and watch
only entertainment programs.19 For its part, the Internet has
dramatically increased the number and types of people with whom one can
enter into contact. But studies on the usage of the Web suggest that
contacts and links are established primarily through personal
affinities, and in particular through ideological affinities within the
political domain. Progressive blogs and forums link to other progressive
sites but not to conservative sites, and vice versa. From these islets
and networks of like-minded individuals we can expect the increased
effects of reinforcement and polarization, because, in general,
interacting with people of similar beliefs pushes one more toward the
extreme positions of the views common to the group.20 Finally, the
movement toward residential segregation, which has already progressed in
the United States and is at work today in Europe, further contributes to
the fragmentation of the public space of communication. If it is true
that opinions are strongly correlated with sociocultural and ethnic
factors, then in a neighborhood whose inhabitants share the same
sociocultural or ethnic profile, each person is likely, for the most
part, to encounter neighbors who share the same opinions. A selective
exposure to similar opinions emerges de facto. Faced with these forces
of fragmentation, [**only intentional collective action** can be
expected to **produce a degree of unification** of the public political
sphere. This second justification for the deliberate encouragement of
adversarial political debates is particularly salient
today]{.underline}. True, [adversarial debate is **by nature
reductive**. Faced with some political problem, the polity usually has a
**multitude of possible courses** of action, not all of which will be
**mutually exclusive**. Yet the reductive character of the adversarial
method is also **one of its merits**. It **simplifies complexity**,
making the choices **easier to grasp**]{.underline}. There is no doubt,
for example, that the current economic situation in Europe and the
United States calls for a range of measures that are more or less
intermingled and complementary to one another. [To obtain a **synoptic
view** of]{.underline} these [measures]{.underline} and their relations
[and to **choose among them** would require **considerable cognitive
effort**]{.underline}. There are cognitive advantages to presenting the
policy response as a choice between reducing public deficits now and
maintaining or increasing these deficits in the short term to prevent
further decline until the economy has regained its normal growth rate.
As democrats, [we **cannot discount the value** of such cognitive
simplicity. Groups of experts may be able to deliberate without using
the adversarial method. But if we want ordinary (or even well-informed)
citizens to **participate ably** in collective deliberation, the
simplification achieved by the adversary system is an **almost
indispensable instrument**.]{.underline} The fourth principle in support
of the adversarial method is the value of treating the minority with
respect. [No matter how conscientiously citizens deliberate, it is
likely that **disagreement will remain** at the end of the
process]{.underline}. Decisions will therefore be taken by the majority.
[The majority of people will get to live with the decision they desired;
a minority of people will have to **live under a decision they did not
support**]{.underline}. To be sure, the decision itself formed the
minority: it did not exist per se before the vote. But the manner of
conducting the deliberation before the vote entails consequences for the
treatment of those who, after the vote, will make up the minority. If
the deliberation has been conducted as a debate between opposed
positions, with each camp presenting its reasons in favor of its
position and criticizing those advanced by the opposition, two
consequences follow. After a vote has been taken, the minority must obey
the decision, but at least the reasons aiming to justify this decision
will have been formulated and made public. The minority might still
refuse to listen to these reasons seriously and in good faith, but it
was given the chance to consider them. The minority members were
therefore treated with the respect owed to autonomous beings. Once
children have reached the age of autonomy, parents must justify the
orders they give them. When they are not yet autonomous, children must
obey orders simply because they are orders. So, too, if the minority
members have not had the possibility of hearing the reasons for the
decision they must obey against their wishes, they are placed in a
situation of having to obey the order simply because it is an order, or
simply because it obtained the most votes. I do not mean to imply that
the members of the minority will consequently be more disposed to obey
the decision. Sometimes justifications exacerbate the opposition. But
justifying orders shows greater respect for the autonomy of those
receiving them. On the flip side, [the reasons for not taking the
decision that ultimately triumphed would also have been put forward.
These criticisms and objections **did not prevail**, but they were at
least **articulated** and **made public**. From the majority\'s
perspective, because it won, it will naturally think that it was right;
but in the process, it **had to listen to the opposition** explaining
their justification]{.underline}. [The members of the majority were **at
minimum forced to see that there were reasons supporting the other
side**. It seems reasonable to think that, as a result, the majority
will be **less inclined** to consider the minority as **unintelligent**
or **ill-intentioned**]{.underline}. Before I proceed to the practical
consequences that we can draw from my argument, I must first respond to
an objection: that rendering obligatory the presentation of opposing
points of view in the public sphere would require constraints on public
discourse and encroachments on freedom of speech. In response to this
objection I would first suggest turning to an institution that in the
relatively recent past followed just this path: the fairness doctrine in
effect in the United States from 1927 to 1987. The fairness doctrine,
implemented by the Federal Communications Commission, made it obligatory
for radio and television stations to give an evenly balanced
presentation of "opposing viewpoints on controversial issues of public
importance." The fairness doctrine not only imposed equality in airtime;
it also required the presentation of viewpoints opposed to one another.
The doctrine did not apply to airtime during electoral campaigns, which
was regulated on other terms. It applied instead to any question that
became the object of public controversy outside of electoral periods.
The constitutionality of this doctrine was upheld by the U.S. Supreme
Court in the famous 1969 decision of Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC.21
The central argument that the Court invoked in support of the
constitutionality of the fairness doctrine was that, in regard to
liberty of expression on the airwaves, it is "the right of the viewing
and listening public, and not the right of the broadcasters, which is
paramount." The Court thus held that listeners and viewers had the right
to hear conflicting viewpoints in order to make up their mind on the
issues: "Speech concerning public affairs is more than self-expression;
it is the essence of self-government."22 The fairness doctrine was
abandoned for two reasons. First, the doctrine led radio and television
stations to avoid controversial subjects for the sake of not exposing
themselves to lawsuits claiming they had violated the law. Second, the
question of what exactly constituted the opposition of one point of view
against another became the subject of repeated litigation, and the fcc
proved unable to reduce the insecurity and juridical uncertainty that
arose on this front. Despite its eventual abandonment, however, the Red
Lion decision shows that the obligation for the media to present
conflicting viewpoints is compatible with a certain interpretation of
freedom of speech in the public sphere, an interpretation that focuses
on the rights of the receiving public. That the U.S. Supreme Court has
since rejected this interpretation does not mean that the arguments
advanced in Red Lion were objectively weak. They are, in any case,
consistent with the claims of this essay. What, then, should we do in
practice to foster the confrontation of opposing arguments in today\'s
democracies? Without claiming to provide a complete and detailed
response to this question, I will conclude by suggesting two concrete
means for promoting the adversarial principle in politics. The first is
a practice yet to be invented, which would be implemented outside of
electoral periods. The second consists of reinforcing a practice already
used in electoral campaigns. First, my suggestion for the future.
Outside of electoral periods, civil-society actors (such as foundations
or think tanks) could organize adversarial debates on subjects of public
interest. These debates would not be regularly scheduled, but would be
organized only when a question sparked significant interest from the
public (as with such topics as nuclear energy, assisted suicide, or, in
certain countries, the wearing of the hijab) or when a large number of
citizens mobilized in favor of a cause. More generally, these public
debates would not aim to replace any existing democratic practices (such
as electoral campaigns or parliamentary debates), but would complement
them. [Neither the exposition of conflicting viewpoints nor
communication across ideological divides can be made mandatory. This
**does not mean** that it is **useless to try to facilitate
them**]{.underline}. Indeed, [**the probability of being confronted with
opposing points of view matters**: it tends to make one\'s thoughts
**more anticipatory**, **careful**, and **subtle**]{.underline}.23 [In
contemporary circumstances, this probability **tends to diminish**. The
**active promotion** of **adversarial debates** aims to **counteract
this pernicious tendency**]{.underline}. Given that the goal of these
debates would be to further the formulation and diffusion of arguments
for and against a given public decision, they should be guided by the
following principle: [speakers should defend or criticize a given policy
or position **only with reference to its own merits**, and not in
response to reasons **external to the policy** or **position**. The
arguments advanced in these debates should concern the **advantages** or
**disadvantages** -- whether technical or moral -- **inherent in the
decision**]{.underline}. I call this the principle of relevant reasons.
This principle has two implications: the first concerns simplifying the
debate to one issue; the second concerns choosing the right
participants. [In order to encourage citizens to **take account of** and
**weigh the reasons for** and **against a given decision**, each
question that can be **defined objectively** and **independent** from
other questions should be **debated separately**. Multidimensionality
and the bundling of different questions **undermine the coherence** of
the arguments]{.underline}. To be sure, at election time, the voter will
vote for a candidate or party that has bundled questions without an
objective connection between them. Such grouping may be desirable,
because it permits negotiations between different strands of the party.
Nevertheless, [to understand the bundling and negotiation **well enough
to cast an informed vote**, the voter needs to have thought through the
different issues **separately**, aided by adversarial
debate]{.underline}. [It is]{.underline} probably [too difficult to
completely exclude nonrelevant reasons]{.underline} -- that is, [reasons
**not substantively linked to the policy in question**]{.underline} --
[at the moment of organizing a deliberative debate. But the principle
**remains valid**: nonrelevant arguments should be **sidelined as much
as possible**. As a consequence, each debate should **focus on a
specific theme**, rather than on **platforms comprising multiple
dimensions**]{.underline}.

### Mellers---Tournaments

#### [Debating policy forecasts]{.underline} in a [competitive tournament format]{.underline} anchored by [fair adjudication]{.underline} encourages [epistemic humility]{.underline} and [cognitive flexibility]{.underline} that [spills outside debate]{.underline}---it's [unique]{.underline} because [broad under-forecasting]{.underline} is breeding [societal dogmatism]{.underline} now

**Mellers, et al, 18**---George Heyman University Professor in the
psychology department at the University of Pennsylvania (Barbara, with
Philip Tetlock and Hal R. Arkes, "Forecasting tournaments, epistemic
humility and attitude depolarization," Cognition, 30 October 2018, dml)

We assume that [the future is **not perfectly knowable**]{.underline} by
any political faction---and that political beliefs are better framed as
continuous probabilities than as off-on, dogmatic certainties. Although
[this assumption]{.underline} sounds uncontroversial, it [is **widely
ignored** in the heat of political controversies]{.underline}.
Content-analytic [studies]{.underline} of election campaigns and [of
debates]{.underline} in elite legislative bodies [have found a
**widespread tendency** to express political opinions in **sharply
dichotomous fashions**]{.underline} (Hopkins and King, 2010, Tetlock,
1981, Tetlock et al., 1984). [**Good-bad**, **categorical rhetoric is
common**, and **nuanced probability judgments are rare**. Americans are
**more polarized now** than at any time in **decades**]{.underline} (Pew
Research Center, 2014, Pew Research Center, 2017). [Many of us appear to
be **Manichaean thinkers** to whom probabilistic thinking **does not
come naturally**]{.underline} (Kahneman, 2011). All of which raises a
question that is part descriptive and part normative: [How feasible is
it to induce people to **treat their political beliefs as testable
probabilistic propositions open to revision** in response to
**dissonant** as well as **consonant evidence** and
**arguments**?]{.underline}

A survey of the psychological literature suggests the grounds for
pessimism out-number those for optimism. [People are often **too quick
to jump to conclusions** from fragmentary evidence]{.underline} (Fiske
and Taylor, 1991, Ross, 1977), [**too slow to update their views** in
the wake of disconfirming evidence]{.underline} (Lord, Ross, & Lepper,
1979), [**too tempted** to apply **weak "can-I-believe-this?" tests** to
agreeable claims and **tough "must-I-believe-this?" tests** to dissonant
claims]{.underline} (Belsky & Gilovich, 2010), **[too prone to
over-confidence]{.underline}** (Moore & Healy, 2008; Lichtenstein,
Fischhoff, & Phillips, 1982) [and **over-estimation** of how much others
share their views]{.underline} (Mullen et al., 1985, Ross et al., 1976),
[and **too fond of seeking out the company of like-minded
others**]{.underline} (Sunstein, 2004) [and, once in their company, of
**embracing increasingly extreme views**]{.underline} (Myers and Lamm,
1976, Sunstein, 2007). Whether working individually or in groups,
[people are often susceptible to **self-justifying cycles of reasoning**
that make them **progressively more self-righteous** and
**contemptuous** of the **competence** and **morality of the other
side**]{.underline} (Haidt, 2012). In this gloomy view of citizen
reasoning, we are "naïve realists" (Ross, in press) who are fated to be
"prisoners of our preconceptions" (Tetlock, 2005).

There are however **[pockets of experimental evidence]{.underline}**
that [give us **guarded grounds for optimism** that, under
**well-defined conditions**, people can shift into **more flexible modes
of thinking** and treat their political attitudes **less as dogmas** and
**more as testable propositions**. **Debiasing studies** have shown that
**careful engineering** of the **questioning process** and **social
context** can induce people to **become more aware** of how little they
know, **more attuned to alternative ways** of looking at the same
reality, and **more skilled at constructively criticizing their own
views** as well as those of **others**]{.underline}---all of which are
widely seen as essential cognitive virtues of democratic citizenship
(Gutmann & Thompson, 2009). We divide the existing work on debiasing
citizen reasoning into three categories.

First, building on Rozenblit and Keil's (2002) work on the illusion of
explanatory depth, Fernbach et al., 2013, Sloman and Fernbach, 2018 have
shown that [asking people to **explain complex policies**]{.underline},
such as transitioning to a single-payer health care system, [makes
people **appreciate the depth of their ignorance** which in turn causes
them to **moderate their policy preferences**. It is **essential**
though that the requests be explanations for "**how**" policies work,
not "**why**" one supports or opposes them---and that the requests fall
in **utilitarian** rather than **deontic domains**, topics on which
people feel that **merely invoking feelings**]{.underline} or hunches
**[would not count as a sufficient rationale]{.underline}**.

Second, building on the work of Ross (Lord et al, 1979) and Koriat et
al., 1980, Hirt and Markman, 1995 showed that [directing people to
"**consider the opposite**" and "**consider an alternative strategy**"
**reduces their confidence** in the focal hypothesis and allows them to
**entertain divergent scenarios**]{.underline}. Arkes, Faust, Guilmette
and Hart (1988) found that this strategy helped neuropsychologists asked
to read a case study and assign confidence judgments to three diagnoses.
[Those]{.underline} who listed at least one piece of evidence consistent
with each diagnosis before assigning confidence judgments [were **less
prone to**]{.underline} the **[hindsight bias]{.underline}** than those
who were told the cause and then asked to imagine the confidence ratings
they would have assigned to each causal candidate.

Third, building on classic symbolic-interactionist ideas about
perspective taking in social interaction (James, 1890, Mead, 1934),
[**many studies** have shown that **carefully choreographed forms of
accountability** can induce people to become more "**integratively
complex**" thinkers]{.underline}, that is, people [who **respect** and
**balance opposing views** and **resist biases** such as **belief
perseverance** and **over-confidence**]{.underline} (Lerner and Tetlock,
1999, Tetlock and Kim, 1987). But [researchers **need to ensure** that
participants **know they are accountable before voicing their
opinions**, and]{.underline} researchers [also]{.underline} need to
ensure [that participants **cannot easily guess the opinions** of those
to whom they **must answer**]{.underline}.

In brief, [researchers need to create **pre-decisional accountability to
an unknown audience**---a type of accountability that we **do not often
encounter** in the world but that **blocks off cognitively simpler
coping strategies**, such as **attitude shifting** toward the evaluative
audience]{.underline} (Cialdini, Levy, & Petty, 1976) [and **defensive
bolstering** of past attitudinal commitments]{.underline} (Festinger,
1957). [This **sweet-spot form** of accountability **boosts the
integrative complexity of reasoning in numerous studies**]{.underline}
(Lerner & Tetlock, 1999). [People]{.underline} seem to [engage
in]{.underline} a coping response known as [**pre-emptive
self-criticism**, in which they **concede legitimacy** to a **wider
range of views**]{.underline} (evaluative differentiation) [and **try to
understand how reasonable people can see the same events
differently**]{.underline} (Schroder et al., 1967, Tetlock, 1983).
[Having done so, people are also **likelier to moderate their
beliefs**]{.underline}.

Across all three lines of investigation, it is striking how careful
"debiasing" investigators need to be in designing their interventions to
pry open otherwise closed minds. Much hinges on who is requesting
explanations for which opinions, how they word their requests and why
people think they are being asked.

We explore a complementary approach to debiasing political judgment:
forecasting **[tournaments]{.underline}** that [challenge people to
**assign accurate probability estimates** to a **wide range of
events**]{.underline}. Tournaments are inherently multifaceted
manipulations that have arisen in response to the practical demands of
real-world organizations to provide policy-makers with timely
probability estimates of the consequences of options (Tetlock and
Gardner, 2015, Wolfers and Zitzewitz, 2004). When we inspect each facet
however, we find close parallels between their intended functions in
tournaments and the goals behind debiasing manipulations developed by
experimental psychologists.

[Tournaments put participants in an **unusual social world** in
which]{.underline} all three debiasing factors mentioned above are at
work. First, [players are **strictly accountable** for the **accuracy of
their views**, **not** for offering views that **play to the prejudices
of the like-minded** as is common in the political world. **Wishful
ideological thinking will quite directly translate into worse
performance**]{.underline}. Second, [tournaments **pressure people to
acknowledge opposing arguments** in the news, as well as **gaps in their
knowledge**, both of which should have effects that parallel those
observed in the illusion-of-explanatory-depth research: **reduce
confidence to more realistic levels** and **moderate affective
preferences**]{.underline}. Third, **[if one's goal is to do well in
a]{.underline}** political forecasting [**tournament**, one is **well
advised** to engage in **perspective taking**, a **defining property of
actively open-minded thinking**]{.underline} (Baron, 2008) [and an
**empirical correlate of top performance in tournaments**]{.underline}
("superforecasters"---Tetlock & Gardner, 2015).

These parallel lines of work---laboratory debiasing and forecasting
tournaments---raise two questions for democratic theory: (a) [if
political opponents were to **participate in**]{.underline} forecasting
[**tournaments focused on issues of the day**, would they learn to be
**more circumspect** in their beliefs?]{.underline}: (b) [if so, would
that process also **reduce the extremity** of their political attitudes,
even political preferences with **no logical connection** to the
probabilistic forecasts elicited in the tournament?]{.underline}

[We present evidence for **conditional optimism**]{.underline}.
Forecasting tournament, [participants must learn to cope with the
"**culture shock**" of moving from the **hurly-burly of the political
world**, in which **polemics dominate**, to the
**pure-epistemic-accountability world of tournaments**]{.underline}.
Tournament organizers can help with this adjustment by giving
participants guidance on the larger purpose of the exercise, on how to
translate inchoate hunches into precise probability metrics and on how
the scoring rules convert probability judgments into accuracy scores. In
sharp contrast to the vague-verbiage predictions so common in
high-visibility, social-media debates in op-eds and blogs, forecasting
[tournaments]{.underline} do not give bonus points for witty put-downs.
They [incentivize forecasters to **do one thing**]{.underline}:
**[getting the best]{.underline}** "Brier **[scores]{.underline}**"
(Brier, 1950) [by]{.underline} being faster than others at [putting
**higher probabilities on things that happen** and **lower probabilities
on things that do not** while avoiding the]{.underline} steep scoring
[**penalties** that accrue to **too hastily** declaring outcomes
"**certain**" or "**impossible**"]{.underline} (Mellers, Stone,
Atanasov, et al., 2015). [This trade-off]{.underline} is tricky. It
[requires balancing **caution** and **courage**]{.underline} (Tetlock,
2005), [where caution refers to skill at **making well-calibrated
probability judgments**]{.underline} that match relevant base rates
(e.g., events assigned 70% probabilities happen about 70% of the time)
[and courage refers to skill at **decisively discriminating between
signals** and **noise**]{.underline}, events and non-events, **[as the
evidence warrants]{.underline}**. Forecasting tournaments are
cognitively demanding.

1.1. The Good Judgment Project The largest scale, political-forecasting
tournaments to date have been sponsored by IARPA or the Intelligence
Advanced Research Projects Activity. From 2011 to 2015, IARPA invested
tens of millions of dollars in five university teams, each of which
competed to invent the best methods of eliciting and aggregating large
numbers of human forecasts in tournaments focused on geopolitical
events. Our team, the Good Judgment Project, won these contests.
Psychologists and statisticians working together constructed aggregate
forecasts on the "right side of maybe" on more than 85% of all daily
forecasts on over 500 questions, outperforming even professional
intelligence analysts who made predictions on the same questions and had
access to classified information (Goldstein, Hartman, Comstock, &
Baumgarten, 2018). The Good Judgment Project conducted experiments by
randomly assigning forecasters to conditions that tested hypotheses
about the drivers of accuracy. We discovered five such drivers: (a)
recruitment and retention of better forecasters; (b) cognitive-debiasing
training; (c) more engaging work environments, in the form of
collaborative teamwork and prediction markets; and (d) better
aggregation rules for distilling the wisdom of the crowd (the
log-odds-extremizing algorithm of Baron et al., 2014, Satopaa et al.,
2014, Satopaa et al., 2014). But the most potent driver was to skim off
the top 2% of forecasters at the end of each tournament year and place
them in elite, superforecaster teams. Despite skeptics' predictions to
the contrary, superforecasters largely resisted regression to the mean
in follow-up years (Mellers, Stone, Murray, et al., 2015).
Superforecasters learned to make well-calibrated, high-resolution
probability judgments with quite impressive consistency (Moore et al.,
2016, Tetlock and Gardner, 2015). They figured out how to treat
uncertainty in a nuanced fashion and use more distinctions on the
probability scale to express their beliefs. These distinctions turned
out to be meaningful. When we examined the loss of accuracy with
counterfactual analyses in which forecasters were assumed to use fewer
probability distinctions by rounding their predictions to the nearest
10% or 20%, accuracy scores based on rounded forecasts were worse than
accuracy scores based on the original forecasts. Rounding forecasts
produced a loss of information that took the largest toll on the most
accurate participants-- superforecasters (Friedman, Baker, Mellers, &
Zeckhauser, 2017). 1.2. The spillover hypothesis: beliefs and attitudes
Our main goal is testing the hypothesis that the process of making
subjective-probability forecasts in tournaments has spillover effects on
attitudes toward controversial political issues. From a formal
philosophical perspective, these two classes of variables are clearly
logically distinct. Forecasts are beliefs about matters of (future)
fact, whereas policy attitudes are ultimately value judgments about what
society ought to do. But of course that does not imply that
fact-grounded forecasts and value-grounded attitudes must also be
psychologically distinct. Much hinges on one's preferred
cognitive-affective framework for representing the connections between
beliefs (often operationalized as probability judgments in the attitude
change literature) and attitudes (operationalized as evaluative or
affective judgments). For instance, viewed from the standpoint of
attitude theories that stress the primacy of affect and treat cognition
(i.e., beliefs) as post hoc justifications for feelings (Haidt, 2001,
Zajonc, 1980), our spillover hypothesis is unrealistically optimistic.
Tails don't wag dogs. Changing policy affect is far likelier to change
policy beliefs than is changing the beliefs to change attitudes. But
viewed from the standpoint of cognition-driven theories that depict
attitudes as derivative products of expectancy-value calculations, as in
Fishbein and Ajzen's (1975) theory of reasoned action and in classical
decision theory, the spillover hypothesis is reasonable as long as the
attitudes are woven into networks of relevant beliefs. If so, when the
beliefs moderate, so too should the relevant attitudes.

Neither of these theoretical camps would however predict the strong
version of the spillover effect that we are proposing: namely, that
[tournaments can **moderate attitudes** by **changing how people
think**, a **cognitive-stylistic shift** in which the **more flexible**
and **analytic style** of thinking about beliefs encouraged by
tournaments **spills over** into how people make "**should**" or
**attitudinal judgments** on topics with **close-to-zero
expectancy-value linkage** to the probabilistic beliefs they endorsed in
tournaments]{.underline}.

To operationalize this idea, imagine we ran a study in which the
forecasting questions focused on exactly the same topics as the attitude
questions---and we discovered, say, that the (humbling) process of
trying to forecast in which cities charter schools boosted test scores
caused people to moderate their policy attitudes about charter schools.
Few observers would be surprised. But the current design provides a
tougher test. There are no strong connections between the forecasting
questions and the policy-attitude questions asked at the end of the
forecasting year. [We **test the hypothesis** that the **cognitively
demanding process** of participating in a tournament---of **having to
balance evidence** to put **well-calibrated probability estimates**
on]{.underline}, say, third quarter GDP [**growth** or **presidential
popularity**---has a **spillover effect** when people take
normative/"should" attitude positions on **unrelated
issues**]{.underline} such as the minimum wage or voter-identification
laws or U.S. policy toward Iran.

Tournaments require forecasters to transform their hunches into numbers
that roughly conform to the axioms of probability, a nontrivial task.
When they do internet searches to discover what high-profile pundits
say, they get little help because the "predictions" advanced in such
debates are rarely sufficiently explicit to be testable. After all,
elites need to preserve their long-term credibility so they tend to
avoid numerical probability judgments that could later be mocked as
embarrassingly far off (Tetlock & Gardner, 2015). It is safer to make
vague-verbiage forecasts, such as "x might well happen" or "there is a
distinct possibility of y" that psychological research has shown
comfortably straddle both sides of 50/50 or "maybe" (Wallsten, Budescu,
& Zwick, 1993). If an event happens, one can say "I warned you it was a
distinct possibility" and if the event never happens, one can shrug it
off by saying "I merely said it was possible."

To avoid this problem, forecasting tournaments press people to make
their beliefs explicit and do what Nate Silver, the founder of the 538
website, routinely does: attach specific numerical probabilities to
possible futures. After the 2016 US Presidential election, Silver was
chastised for falling on what appeared to be the "wrong side of maybe."
He had placed a 70% probability on a Clinton presidency. Was he wrong?
Drawing the correct conclusion requires an understanding that: (a) 70%
might have been the best forecast possible at the time; (b) the poll
aggregation techniques on which Silver relies were well calibrated,
which means that when Silver makes probabilistic predictions of events,
those events tend to occur roughly 70% of the time. They will "look
wrong" about 30% of the time (Lichtenstein et al., 1982).

Unfortunately, the vague-verbiage forecasting habits that confer
political safety on pundits also make it extremely difficult, arguably
impossible, to become a more realistic appraiser of the probabilities of
real-world events. [Without **measurement** of forecasting accuracy,
learning **can't take place**]{.underline}. To invoke an old
Wittgenstein aphorism, the limits of our language are the limits of our
world. [It is **hard to figure out whether**]{.underline} probability
**[judgments]{.underline}** of 70% [**are well-calibrated** if one is
**unsure** when one made]{.underline} 70% [forecasts]{.underline} and
unsure [of **what happened** when one did. The **potential mind-opening
power** of]{.underline} forecasting [tournaments comes from the fact
that they **pressure us to recognize the limits of our knowledge** and
focus on the world **as it is**, **not as we wish it to be**. They
expose us to]{.underline} the same criticisms that Nate Silver
experienced \-- [being on the "**wrong side of maybe**."]{.underline}

Forecasting [tournaments **push people out of their**]{.underline}
vague-verbiage [**comfort zone** and ask them to **quantify
uncertainty** in **as granular a fashion** as the problem permits. It is
this **more tentative** and **granular mode of thinking inculcated
in**]{.underline} forecasting [**tournaments** that]{.underline} we
hypothesize [can **spill over into unrelated attitude judgments outside
the tournament**]{.underline}.

### Poscher---Ground

#### Neg ground outweighs---the labor of the negative is the only unique feature of debate. Their model can't explain why we switch sides and why there has to be a winner and a loser.

**Poscher, 16**---director at the Institute for Staatswissenschaft and
Philosophy of Law at the University of Freiburg (Ralf, "Why We Argue
About the Law: An Agonistic Account of Legal Disagreement",
*Metaphilosophy of Law*, Tomasz Gizbert-Studnicki/Adam Dyrda/Pawel Banas
(eds.), Hart Publishing, forthcoming, dml)

Hegel's dialectical thinking powerfully exploits [the idea of
**negation**]{.underline}. It [is]{.underline} a
**[central]{.underline}** feature of spirit and consciousness that they
have the power to negate. The spirit "is this power only by looking the
negative in the face and tarrying with it. This \[...\] is the magical
power that converts it into being."102 The tarrying with the negative is
part of what Hegel calls **[the "labour of the
negative"]{.underline}**103. In a loose reference to this Hegelian
notion Gerald Postema [points to]{.underline} yet another feature of
[disagreements as a **necessary ingredient** of the process of practical
reasoning. Only if our reasoning is **exposed to contrary arguments**
can we **test its merits**. We must go through **the "labor of the
negative"** to have trust in our deliberative processes]{.underline}.104

This also holds where we seem to be in agreement. [Agreement without
exposure to disagreement can be **deceptive**]{.underline} in various
ways. [The first phenomenon]{.underline} Postema draws attention to
[is]{.underline} the **[group polarization]{.underline}** effect. When a
group of like‐minded people deliberates an issue, informational and
reputational cascades produce more extreme views in the process of their
deliberations.105 [The polarization and biases that are well documented
for such groups]{.underline}106 [can be **countered**]{.underline} at
least in some settings [by the **inclusion of dissenting
voices**]{.underline}. In these scenarios, [disagreement can be a cure
for dysfunctional deliberative polarization and biases]{.underline}.107
[A second]{.underline} deliberative [dysfunction]{.underline} mitigated
by disagreement [is **superficial agreement**]{.underline}, which can
even be manipulatively used in the sense of a "presumptuous 'We'"108.
[Disagreement can help]{.underline} to police such distortions of
deliberative processes [by challenging superficial
agreements]{.underline}. Disagreements may thus signal that a
deliberative process is not contaminated with dysfunctional agreements
stemming from polarization or superficiality. [Protecting our discourse
against such contaminations is valuable **even if we do not come to
terms**. Each of the opposing positions will **profit from the catharsis
it received** "by **looking the negative in the face** and **tarrying
with it**".]{.underline}

These advantages of disagreement in collective deliberations are
mirrored on the individual level. [Even if the probability of reaching a
consensus with our opponents is **very low from the
beginning**]{.underline}, as might be the case in deeply entrenched
conflicts, [entering into an exchange of arguments can still serve to
**test** and **improve our position**. We have to **do the "labor of the
negative" for ourselves**. Even if we cannot come up with a line of
argument that coheres well with everybody else's beliefs]{.underline},
attitudes and dispositions, [we can still come up with a line of
argument that achieves this goal **for our own personal
beliefs**]{.underline}, attitudes and dispositions. To provide ourselves
with the most coherent system of our own beliefs, attitudes and
dispositions is -- at least in important issues -- an aspect of personal
integrity -- to borrow one of Dworkin's favorite expressions for a less
aspirational idea.

[In hard cases we must]{.underline} -- in some way -- [lay out the
argument for ourselves to figure out what we believe to be the right
answer. We might not know what we believe ourselves]{.underline} in
questions of abortion, the death penalty, torture, and stem cell
research, [until we have **developed a line of argument** against the
background of our subjective beliefs, attitudes and
dispositions]{.underline}. In these cases [it might be rational to
**discuss the issue** with someone unlikely to share some of our more
fundamental convictions or who **opposes the view** towards which we
lean. This might even be **the most helpful way of corroborating a
view**, because we know that our adversary is **much more motivated** to
find a potential flaw in our argument than someone with whom we know we
are in agreement]{.underline}. It might be more helpful to discuss a
liberal position with Scalia than with Breyer if we want to make sure
that we have not overlooked some counter‐argument to our case.

[It would be **too narrow** an understanding of our practice
of]{.underline} legal [disagreement and argumentation if we restricted
its purpose to **persuading an adversary** in the case at hand and
inferred from this narrow understanding the **irrationality of
argumentation** in hard cases]{.underline}, in which we know beforehand
that we will not be able to persuade. Rational argumentation is a much
more complex practice in a more complex social framework. [Argumentation
with an adversary can have **purposes beyond persuading**]{.underline}
him: [to **test one's own convictions**, to **engage our opponent** in
inferential commitments and to **persuade third parties** are only some
of these; to **rally our troops** or **express our convictions** might
be others]{.underline}. To make our peace with Kant we could say that
"there must be a hope of coming to terms" with someone though not
necessarily with our opponent, but maybe only a third party or even just
ourselves and not necessarily only on the issue at hand, but maybe
through inferential commitments in a different arena.

f\) The Advantage Over Non‐Argumentative Alternatives

It goes without saying that in real world legal disagreements, all of
the reasons listed above usually play in concert and will typically hold
true to different degrees relative to different participants in the
debate: There will be some participants for whom our hope of coming to
terms might still be justified and others for whom only some of the
other reasons hold and some for whom it is a mixture of all of the
reasons in shifting degrees as our disagreements evolve. It is also
apparent that, with the exception of the first reason, [the rationality
of our disagreements is of a **secondary nature**. The rational **does
not lie** in the discovery of a **single right answer** to the topic of
debate]{.underline}, since in hard cases there are no single right
answers. Instead, [our disagreements are instrumental to rationales
which lie beyond the topic at hand, like the **exploration of our
communalities** or of our **inferential commitments**. Since these
reasons are of this secondary nature, they must **stand up to
alternative ways** of settling irreconcilable disagreements]{.underline}
that have other secondary reasons in their favor -- like swiftness of
decision making or using fewer resources. [Why does our legal practice
**require lengthy arguments** and **discursive efforts**]{.underline}
even in appellate or supreme court cases of irreconcilable legal
disagreements? [The closure has to come by some non‐argumentative
mean]{.underline} and courts have always relied on them. For the
medieval courts of the Germanic tradition it is bequeathed that judges
had to fight it out literally if they disagreed on a question of law --
though the king allowed them to pick surrogate fighters.109 It is
understandable that the process of civilization has led us to
non‐violent non‐ argumentative means to determine the law. But [what was
wrong with]{.underline} District Judge Currin of Umatilla County in
Oregon, who -- in his late days -- decided inconclusive traffic
violations by publicly [flipping a coin]{.underline}?110 If we are
counting heads at the end of our lengthy argumentative proceedings
anyway, [why not decide hard cases by **gut voting at the outset** and
**spare everybody the cost** of **developing elaborate arguments** on
questions, where there is not fact of the matter to be
discovered?]{.underline}

One reason lies in the mixed nature of our reasons in actual legal
disagreements. The different second order reasons can be held apart
analytically, but not in real life cases. The hope of coming to terms
will often play a role at least for some time relative to some
participants in the debate. A second reason is that [the objectives
listed above **could not be achieved by a non‐argumentative
procedure**]{.underline}. Flipping a coin, throwing dice or [**taking a
gut vote** would not help us to **explore our communalities** or our
inferential commitments nor help to **scrutinize the positions** in
play]{.underline}. A third reason is the overall rational aspiration of
the law that Dworkin relates to in his integrity account111. In a
justificatory sense112 [the law aspires to give a coherent account of
itself -- even if it is not the only right one -- required by equal
respect under conditions of normative disagreement]{.underline}.113
[Combining legal argumentation with the non‐argumentative decision‐
making procedure of counting reasoned opinions serves the coherence
aspiration of the law]{.underline} in at least two ways: First, [the
labor of the negative reduces the chances that constructions of the law
that have major flaws or inconsistencies built into the arguments
supporting them will prevail]{.underline}. Second, [since every position
**must be a reasoned one** within the given framework of the law, it
must be one that **somehow fits** into the **overall structure** of the
law along **coherent lines**. It thus protects against **incoherent
"checkerboard" treatments**]{.underline}114 [of hard cases. It is the
**combination** of **reasoned disagreement** and the **non‐rational
decision‐making mechanism** of counting reasoned opinions that provides
for both in hard cases]{.underline}: a decision and one -- of multiple
possible -- coherent constructions of the law. [Pure non‐rational
procedures]{.underline} -- like flipping a coin -- [would only provide
for the decision part. Pure argumentative procedures -- which are not
geared towards a decision procedure -- would **undercut the incentive
structure** of our agonistic disagreements]{.underline}.115 In the face
of unresolvable disagreements endless debates would seem an idle
enterprise. [That the debates are **about winning** or **losing** helps
to **keep the participants engaged**. That the decision depends on
**counting reasoned opinions** guarantees that the engagement **focuses
on rational argumentation**]{.underline}. No plain non‐argumentative
procedure would achieve this result. [If the judges were to **flip a
coin**]{.underline} at the end of the trial in hard cases, [there would
be **little incentive** to engage in an **exchange of arguments**. It is
specifically the count of reasoned opinions which provides for rational
scrutiny in our legal disagreements]{.underline} and thus contributes to
the rationales discussed above.

2\. THE SEMANTICS OF AGONISTIC DISAGREEMENTS

The agonistic account does not presuppose a fact of the matter, it is
not accompanied by an ontological commitment, and the question of how
the fact of the matter could be known to us is not even raised. Thus
[the agonistic account]{.underline} of legal disagreement is not
confronted with the metaphysical or epistemological questions that
plague one‐right‐answer theories in particular. However, it
[must]{.underline} still [come up with a semantics that explains in what
sense we **disagree about the same issue** and are not just **talking at
cross purposes**]{.underline}.

In a series of articles David Plunkett and Tim Sundell have
reconstructed legal disagreements in semantic terms as metalinguistic
negotiations on the usage of a term that at the center of a hard case
like "cruel and unusual punishment" in a death‐penalty case.116 [Even
though the different sides in the debate define the term differently,
they are **not talking past each other**, since they are engaged
in]{.underline} a metalinguistic [negotiation on]{.underline} the use of
[**the same term**.]{.underline} The metalinguistic negotiation on the
use of [the term serves as a **semantic anchor** for a disagreement on
the substantive issues]{.underline} connected with the term because of
its functional role in the law. The "cruel and unusual
punishment"‐clause thus serves to argue about the permissibility of the
death penalty. This account, however only provides a very superficial
semantic commonality. But the commonality between the participants of a
legal disagreement go deeper than a discussion whether the term "bank"
should in future only to be used for financial institutions, which
fulfills every criteria for semantic negotiations that Plunkett and
Sundell propose. Unlike in mere semantic negotiations, like the on the
disambiguation of the term "bank", there is also some kind of identity
of the substantive issues at stake in legal disagreements.

A promising route to capture this aspect of legal disagreements might be
offered by recent semantic approaches that try to accommodate the
externalist challenges of realist semantics,117 which inspire
one‐right‐answer theorists like Moore or David Brink. Neo‐ descriptivist
and two‐valued semantics provide for the theoretical or interpretive
element of realist semantics without having to commit to the ontological
positions of traditional externalism. In a sense they offer externalist
semantics with no ontological strings attached.

The less controversial aspect of the externalist picture of meaning
developed in neo‐ descriptivist and two‐valued semantics can be found in
the deferential structure that our meaning‐providing intentions often
encompass.118 In the case of natural kinds, speakers defer to the
expertise of chemists when they employ natural kind terms like gold or
water. If a speaker orders someone to buy \$ 10,000 worth of gold as a
safe investment, he might not know the exact atomic structure of the
chemical element 79. In cases of doubt, though, he would insist that he
meant to buy only stuff that chemical experts -- or the markets for that
matter -- qualify as gold. The deferential element in the speaker's
intentions provides for the specific externalist element of the
semantics.

In the case of the law, the meaning‐providing intentions connected to
the provisions of the law can be understood to defer in a similar manner
to the best overall theory or interpretation of the legal materials.
Against the background of such a semantic framework the conceptual unity
of a linguistic practice is not ratified by the existence of a single
best answer, but by the unity of the interpretive effort that extends to
legal materials and legal practices that have sufficient overlap119 --
be it only in a historical perspective120. [The fulcrum of
disagreement]{.underline} that Dworkin sees in the existence of a single
right answer121 [does not lie in its existence, but in **the communality
of the effort** -- if only on the basis of an **overlapping common
ground** of legal **materials**, **accepted practices**, **experiences**
and **dispositions**. As two athletes are **engaged in the same
contest** when they **follow the same rules**, **share the same concept
of winning and losing** and act in the same context, but **follow very
different styles**]{.underline} of e.g. wrestling, boxing, swimming etc.
[They are in the same contest, **even if there is no single best
style**]{.underline} in which to wrestle, box or swim.
[Each]{.underline}, however, [is engaged in developing the best style to
win against their opponent, just as two lawyers try to develop the best
argument to convince]{.underline} a bench of [judges]{.underline}.122
[Within such a semantic framework even people with radically opposing
views about the application of an expression can still **share a
concept**, in that they are **engaged in the same process** of
theorizing over **roughly the same legal materials** and
**practices**]{.underline}. [Semantic frameworks along these lines allow
for adamant disagreements without abandoning the idea that people are
**talking about the same concept**]{.underline}. [An
agonistic]{.underline} account of legal disagreement can build on such a
semantic [framework]{.underline}, which [can explain in what
sense]{.underline} lawyers, judges and [scholars engaged in agonistic
disagreements are **not talking past each other**. They are engaged in
developing the best interpretation of roughly the same]{.underline}
legal [materials, albeit against the background of diverging beliefs,
attitudes and dispositions that lead them to divergent
conclusions]{.underline} in hard cases. Despite the divergent
conclusions, [semantic unity is provided by the **largely overlapping
legal materials** that **form the basis** for their disagreement. Such a
semantic **collapses** only when we **lack a sufficient overlap** in the
materials]{.underline}. To use an example of Michael Moore's: If we
wanted to debate whether a certain work of art was "just", we share
neither paradigms nor a tradition of applying the concept of justice to
art such as to engage in an intelligible controversy.

**Shively 2K** -- Professor of Political Science, Texas A & M

(Ruth, *Political Theory and Partisan Politics*, p. 181-2)

The requirements thus far are primarily negative. The ambiguists must
say "no" to---they must reject and limit---some ideas and actions. In
what follows, we will also find that they must say "yes" to some things.
In particular, [they must say "yes" to the idea of rational persuasion.
This means]{.underline}, first, [that they must recognize the role of
agreement in political contest, or the basic accord that is necessary to
discord]{.underline}. The mistake that the ambiguists make here is a
common one. The mistake in thinking that agreement marks the end of
contest. In most cases, however, our agreements are highly imperfect. We
agree on some matters but not on others, on generalities but not on
specifics, on principles but not on their applications, and so on. And
[this kind of limited agreement is the **starting condition** of contest
and debate]{.underline}. As John Courtney Murray writes: We hold certain
truths; therefore we can argue about them. It seems to have been one of
the corruptions of intelligence by positivism to assume that argument
ends when agreement is reached. In a basic sense, the reverse is true.
[There can be no agreement except on the premise]{.underline}, and
within a context, [of agreement]{.underline}. (Murray 1960, 10) In other
words, [we **cannot argue** about something]{.underline} if we are not
communicating: [if we cannot agree on the topic and terms of
argument]{.underline} or if we have utterly different ideas about what
counts as evidence or good argument. [At the very least, we must agree
about what it is that is being debated before we can debate
it]{.underline}. For instance, **[one cannot have an argument about
euthanasia with someone who thinks euthanasia is a musical
group]{.underline}**. One cannot successfully stage a sit-in if one's
target audience simply thinks everyone is resting or if those doing the
sitting have no complaints. [Nor can one demonstrate resistance to a
policy if no one knows that it is a policy. In other words, contest is
meaningless if there is a lack of agreement or communication about what
is being contested.]{.underline} Registers, demonstrators, **[and
debaters must have]{.underline}** some [shared ideas about the **subject
and**]{.underline}/or [**terms** of their disagreements]{.underline}.
The participants and the target of a sit-in must share an understanding
of the complaint at hand. And a demonstrator's audience must know what
is being resisted. In short, [the contesting of an idea presumes some
agreement about what that idea is and how one might go about
intelligibly contesting it]{.underline}. In other words, [contestation
rests on some basic agreement or harmony]{.underline}.∂ The point may
seem trite, as surely the ambiguists would agree that basic terms must
be shared before they can be resisted and problematized. In fact, they
are often very candid about this seeming paradox in their approach: the
paradoxical or \"parasitic\" need of the subversive for an order to
subvert.∂ But admitting the paradox is not helpful if, as usually
happens here, its implications are ignored; or if the only implication
drawn is that order or harmony is an unhappy fixture of human life. For
what the paradox should tell us is that [some kinds of]{.underline}
harmonies or [orders are, in fact, good for resistance]{.underline}; and
some ought to be fully supported. As such, it should counsel against the
kind of careless rhetoric that lumps all orders or harmonies together as
arbitrary and inhumane. Clearly some [basic accord about the terms of
contest is a necessary ground for **all** further contest. It may be
that if the ambiguists]{.underline} [wish to remain
full-fledged]{.underline} ambiguists, [they cannot admit to these
implications, for to open the door to some agreements]{.underline} or
reasons as good and some orders as helpful or necessary, [is to open the
door to]{.underline} some sort of [rationalism]{.underline}. Perhaps
[they might just continue to insist]{.underline} that this initial
condition is ironic, but [that]{.underline} the irony [should not stand
in the way of the real business of subversion]{.underline}.∂ [Yet
difficulties remain]{.underline}. For [agreement is not simply the
initial condition, but the continuing ground, for contest]{.underline}.
If we are to successfully communicate our disagreements, we cannot
simply agree on basic terms and then proceed to debate without attention
to further agreements. [For debate and contest are forms of dialogue:
that is, they are activities premised on the building of progressive
agreements]{.underline}.∂ [Imagine, for instance, that two people are
having an argument about the issue of gun control]{.underline}. As noted
earlier, in any argument, **[certain initial agreements will be needed
just to begin the discussion]{.underline}**. At the very least, [the two
discussants must agree on **basic terms**: for example, they must have
some shared sense of what gun control is about; what is at issue in
arguing about it; what facts are being contested]{.underline}, and so
on. They must also agree---and they do so simply by entering into
debate---that they will not use violence or threats in making their
cases and that they are willing to listen to, and to be persuaded by,
good arguments. Such agreements are simply implicit in the act of
argumentation.\',∂ Imagine, then, that our two discussants have the
following kind of exchange:∂ Mary Cuns don\'t kill people; people kill
people.∂ Tom: Yes, but guns make it a lot easier for people to kill one
another.∂ Mary: That\'s not necessarily true. There are lots of other
murder weapons---knives or rat poison, for instance---that may be just
as handy and lethal.∂ At this point, the argument reaches an impasse.
Tom has presented i claim that Mary does not accept. Thus, if the
argument is to continue, Tom must either find a way to convince Mary oi
this claim or he must go on to a different line of argument. Let us say
that, in this case, lorn backs up his initial claim with further
evidence. Perhaps he has some evidence to show that people are less apt
to survive a gunshot wound than they are to survive being stabbed or
poisoned. Mary then relents on this point:∂ ∂ Mary: All right, I\'ll
grant you that gun shot wounds an? more apt to kill people. But that\'s
exactly the reason I want lo own a gun---so I can effectively protect
myself and my family.∂ Tom: Well I sympathize with that motive, but 1
don\'t think owning a gun is the best way to protect yourself. In fact,
I\'ve heard that people who own guns are more apt to get injured or
killed them¬selves than to protect themselves against an intruder.∂
Mary: What?! I find that very difficult to believe.∂ Here, again, our
discussants reach an impasse. If the argument is to go further, they
must either find a way to agree on the disputed claim, or move on to
another claim (if there is one). Thus, if Tom has some further evidence
that Mary will find convincing, they can continue this line of
reasoning; if he does not, then they must move on to something else or
give up the argument completely.∂ This is the ordinary ebb and flow of
debate. Argument continues .is long as there is some hope of progress in
coming to agreement or as long as there are other lines of argument to
be explored. But if there∂ ∂ comes a point a I which the two sides run
out of new claims or cannot igree about the facts supporting claims
already made, the argument is effectively over. The participants may
continue to shout at one an¬other, as they often do, but there is no
longer anything positive or informative that can come from their
interaction. There is nothing more to be learned and nothing that either
side will find convincing.∂ The point here is that in arguing---and the
point holds equally for other forms of contest---we assume that it is
possible to educate or persuade one another. We assume that it is
possible to come to more mutual understandings of an issue and that the
participants in an argument are open to this possibility. [Otherwise,
there is **no** **point** to the exercise; we are **simply talking at or
past one another**]{.underline}.∂ [At this point,]{.underline} the
[ambiguists might respond that, even if there are such rules of
argument, they do not apply to]{.underline} the more [subversive or
radical activities]{.underline} they have in mind. Subversion is, after
all, about questioning and undermining such seemingly \"necessary\" or
universal rules of behavior.∂ **[But]{.underline}**, again, the response
to the ambiguist must be that [the practice of questioning]{.underline}
and undermining [rules]{.underline}, like all other social practices,
[**needs a certain order**. The subversive **needs rules** to protect
subversion. And when we look more closely at the rules protective of
subversion, we find that they are roughly the rules of
argument]{.underline} discussed above. In fact, the rules of argument
are roughly the rules of democracy or civility: the delineation of
boundaries necessary to protect speech and action from violence,
manipulation and other forms of tyranny.

## Blocks

### AT: Agency=Illusory

#### Even illusory agency is productive. Imagining possible changes is necessary to motivate action.

Elizabeth **SHOVE** Sociology @ Lancaster **AND** Gordon **WALKER**
Geography @ Lancaster **'7** \["CAUTION! Transitions ahead: politics,
practice, and sustainable transition management," *Environment and
Planning C* 39 (4)\]

For academic readers, our commentary argues for loosening the
intellectual grip of 'innovation studies', for backing off from the
nested, hierarchical multi-level model as the only model in town, and
for exploring other social scientific, but also systemic theories of
change. [The more we think about the politics and practicalities
of]{.underline} reflexive [transition management]{.underline}, the more
complex the process appears: for a policy audience, our words of caution
could be read as an invitation to abandon the whole endeavour. If
agency, predictability and legitimacy are as limited as we've suggested,
this might be the only sensible conclusion.However, [we are with
Rip]{.underline} (2006) [in recognising the value, productivity and
everyday necessity of an **'illusion of agency'**]{.underline}, [and of
the working expectation that a difference can be made even in the face
of so much evidence to the contrary. The outcomes of actions are
unknowable, the system unsteerable and the effects of deliberate
intervention inherently unpredictable and, ironically, it is this that
sustains concepts of agency and management]{.underline}. As Rip argues
'[**illusions are productive** because they **motivate action** and
repair work, and thus something]{.underline} (whatever) [is
achieved']{.underline} (Rip 2006: 94). [Situated inside the systems they
seek to influence, governance actors]{.underline} -- and actors of other
kinds as well - [are part of the **dynamics of change**: even if they
cannot steer from the outside they are **necessary to processes
within**. This is]{.underline}, of course, also [true of academic
life]{.underline}. Here [we are]{.underline}, busy critiquing and
[analysing transition management in the expectation that somebody
somewhere is listening and]{.underline} maybe [even taking notice. If we
removed that illusion would we bother writing anything at all? Maybe we
need such fictions to keep us going, and maybe -- fiction or no -
somewhere along the line something really does happen]{.underline}, but
not in ways that we can anticipate or know.

### AT: Defending State=Violent

#### Demands on the state are a productive center of discussion but don't tie us to the government or its legitimacy

Saul **Newman**, PhD, Professor of Political Theory, Goldsmith
University, London, **'11**

(*The Politics of Postanarchism*, pg. 114)

[Despite the]{.underline} obvious [pitfalls of the Leninist vanguard
strategy]{.underline}, [we should]{.underline} nevertheless [take
Zizek\'s challenge]{.underline} to Critchley [seriously]{.underline}:
that, in other words, [the problem with the strategy of working outside
the state is that it **may essentially leave the state
intact**]{.underline}, [and entail an irresponsible and even
**self-indulgent politics of demand**]{.underline} that hides a secret
reliance on the state to take care of the everyday running of society.
Is there some truth to this claim? There are two aspects that I would
like to address here. [First, the notion of demand:]{.underline} [making
certain demands on the state]{.underline} - say for higher wages, equal
rights for excluded groups, [to not go to war or an **end to draconian
policing**]{.underline} - [is one of the **basic strategies** of social
movements and radical groups.]{.underline} [Making such demands **does
not necessarily mean working within the state or reaffirming its
legitimacy.**]{.underline} [On the **contrary**]{.underline}, [demands
are made from a position **outside the established political
order**]{.underline}**,** [and they often **exceed the question of the
implementation**]{.underline} of this or that specific measure. [They
implicitly **call into question the legitimacy** and even the
sovereignty of the state]{.underline} [by highlighting fundamental
inconsistencies between]{.underline}, for instance, [a formal
constitutional order that guarantees certain rights and equalities, and
state practices that]{.underline} in reality violate and [deny
them]{.underline}. Jacques [Ranciere gives a succinct
example]{.underline} of this when he discusses [Olympe de Gouges, who,
at the time of the French Revolution, demanded that women be given the
right to go to the Assembly]{.underline}. In doing so, [she demonstrated
the inconsistency between the promise of equalit]{.underline}y - invoked
in a general sense and yet denied in the particular by the Declaration
of the Rights of Man and the Citizen - [and the political order which
was formally based on this:]{.underline} Women could make a twofold
demonstration. They could demonstrate that they were deprived of the
rights that they had, thanks to the Declaration of Rights. And they
could demonstrate, through their public action, that they had the rights
that the constitution denied to them, that they could enact those
rights. So they could act as subjects of the Rights of Man in the
precise sense that 1 have mentioned. [They acted as subjects that did
not have the rights that they had and had the rights that they had
not]{.underline}.21

### AT: Exclusion

#### Our interpretation is open to contestation but comparatively better than a model that allows affirmation of anything whatsoever -- criticisms of "exclusion" do not invalidate the utility of using a model of debate centered around [state praxis]{.underline} as a *regulative ideal* toward which debate moves towards -- their model reduces [politics]{.underline} to [luck]{.underline} 

**Ruti '15** (Prof. of English and Critical Theory @ U. Toronto,
*Between Levinas and Lacan: Self, Other, Ethics*, pp. 170-176)

After the collapse of metaphysical justifications for universality, [we
do not have any choice but to admit that **the version of universality
we conjure** into existence]{.underline} -- and the a priori norms that
support this universality -- **[inevitably arises in a particular
context]{.underline}**: it is historically and culturally specific even
as it strives to transcend this specificity. [But]{.underline} -- and my
point here mirrors the argument I made about rationality above --
[**this does not mean that our universalism is intrinsically
worthless**; while the loss of metaphysical foundations for our
normative systems complicates their claim to universality, it does not
automatically invalidate them.]{.underline} This is exactly what Allen
is getting at in the passage I quoted at the beginning of this chapter:
[we make a mistake if we assume that our only options are either the
delusion of being able to transcend our context into a realm of \"pure\"
universality or a descent into \"anything-goes\"
relativism.]{.underline} More specifically, Allen argues that we can
profess the universal validity of some of our principles -- such as the
principles of equality, reciprocity, or mutual respect -- as long as we
remain aware that these principles are derived from the historical and
cultural resources of Western modernity. In this manner, Allen advocates
what she calls \"principled contextualism\": we may take our norms \"to
be universal and context transcendent, as long as we recognize that the
notions of universalizability and context transcendence are themselves
situated in the context of late Western modernity\" (PS 180). An
important part of this recognition is the admission that [\"it may turn
out from some future vantage point that our normative ideals are
themselves]{.underline}, in some ways that we have yet to realize,
[pernicious]{.underline} and oppressive\" (PS 180). That is, we need to
be \"more historically self-conscious and modest about the status of our
normative principles\" (PS 180); among other things, [we need to be open
to the possibility that our principles can be contested.]{.underline}
Yet [this does not imply that \"we are incapable of making normative
judgments in light of such principles\"]{.underline} (PS 180). Allen is
looking for a way out of nihilistic relativism by proposing that our
awareness that we must continuously interrogate our ethical principles
does not mean that these principles are devoid of all value. Nor does
our recognition that our principles cannot be divorced from their
context mean that we cannot claim that they are capable of transcending
their context; that is, [our principles can be context-transcending
without being context-neutral.]{.underline} This, as we saw in Chapter
2, is Butler\'s argument in *Parting Ways*, even if she ends up
backpedaling on the univcrsalist implications of her approach. 14 More
important for our present purposes, this is how Allen arrives at the
\"historical a priori\" I have referred to in passing. As Allen
explains, [\"The historical specificity of our a priori
categories]{.underline}, their rootedness in historically variable
social and linguistic practices and institutions\" (PS 31-2) [does not
cancel the power of these categories to order our
existence.]{.underline} However, [**if we want others to be convinced by
our a priori ideals, we need to persuade them through a democratic
process. If the Enlightenment resorted to aggression** to spread its
views, **the Habermasian democratic method**]{.underline}, according to
Allen, **[relies on more collectively formed public
opinions.]{.underline}** Allen\'s point is akin to the one Benhabib
makes through her notion of \"democratic iterations\": [rather than the
solitary Kantian subject trying to figure out in the abstract what
everyone might conceivably agree on, the Habermasian approach offers a
model where **social agents collaborate** with each other **to forge a
perspective** that everyone can agree on. This junction]{.underline} of
compatible views, then, [becomes the current \"historical a
priori]{.underline},[\"]{.underline} the current version of the
universal. [Any given \"historical a priori\" can obviously take
hegemonic forms. I grant]{.underline}, as does Allen, [that we need to
remain vigilant]{.underline} about the constitutive exclusions that a
priori norms often imply. [Yet **the merits of a normative system that
is brought into being through a continuous democratic process** -- a
process **that can accommodate the tensions of rethinking**, refinement,
**and renegotiation**]{.underline} -- also **[seem
considerable.]{.underline}** Borrowing from Fraser, one could say that
the historical a priori is always open to reframing. [Such reframing
happens]{.underline}, for instance, [when individuals]{.underline} or
groups [who have been excluded from a given ethical frame demand
admission to it, thereby]{.underline} automatically [altering the
parameters of the frame.]{.underline} Proposing that \"misframing\" may
be \"the defining injustice of a globalizing age,\" Fraser advocates --
echoing Butler\'s observations about the necessity of revising the
frames of perception that eliminate some populations from the status of
the fully human -- \"an enlarged, transnational sense of who counts as
one\'s fellow subjects of justice.\" 15 This implies that [when the
frame shifts]{.underline} -- say, from a national to a transnational one
-- [so does the historical a priori: an a priori that was formulated in
a given national context might not be appropriate for a transnational
one.]{.underline} There must thus be a period of readjustment, but this
does not imply the neutralization of the a priori -- as some cultural
relativists might assume -- but merely its reconfiguration. Or, to
restate the larger argument I have tried to articulate, [the concept of
the historical a priori requires that we admit that an a priori
principle can be normatively meaningful even as it is open to
alteration]{.underline}; the a priori -- as I noted above -- holds until
it is deemed somehow flawed or unjust. In Fraser\'s words, **[\"The
result would be a grammar of justice that incorporates an orientation to
closure necessary for political argument, but that treats every closure
as provisional]{.underline}** -- subject to question, possible
suspension, and thus to reopening\" (SJ72). The model Fraser advocates
hence treats every ethical closure as provisional. Fraser calls
[this]{.underline} model [\"reflexive
justice]{.underline},[\"]{.underline} specifying that it [scrambles the
opposition between the Habermasian democratic model]{.underline} on the
one hand [and the more poststructuralist]{.underline}, Marxist, and
skeptical model (which she calls \"[agonistic]{.underline}\") -- the
[model]{.underline} that dominates contemporary progressive criticism --
on the other. [If the first of these is sometimes accused of being
excessively normalizing, the second]{.underline}-which is essentially
the model I have been analyzing in this book (with the exception of
Levinas) -- [is]{.underline}, as Fraser puts it, [\"often seen as
irresponsibly reveling in abnormality\"]{.underline} (SJ73 ). Against
this backdrop, the advantage of Fraser\'s model is the following: [Like
agonistic models, **reflexive justice valorizes** the moment of
**opening**]{.underline}, which breaches the exclusions of normal
justice, [embracing claimants the latter has silenced]{.underline} and
disclosing injustices the latter has occluded-all of which it holds
essential for contesting injustice. **[Like discourse ethics, however,
reflexive justice also valorizes the moment of closure, which enables
political argument, collective decision-making, and public action -- all
of which it deems indispensable for remedying injustice.]{.underline}**
(SJ73-4) In this manner, [Fraser declares the standard opposition
between]{.underline} the [Habermasians and]{.underline} the
[agonists]{.underline} to be a [false]{.underline} one, [for **it is
possible to admit the best insights of both by acknowledging the value
of** both opening (**contestation**) **and closure** (binding norms that
enable ethical and political decisions).]{.underline} [**Such an
approach rejects relativism, enabling** normative judgments and
**political interventions, but without thereby locking the content of
such judgments** and interventions **into a fixed, immutable
definition.**]{.underline} All of [this]{.underline} of course [implies
that there is one norm that stands above every other]{.underline}: what
Fraser calls [\"the overarching normative principle of parity of
participation\"]{.underline} (SJ60). On this view, Fraser explains,
\"Overcoming injustice means dismantling institutionalized obstacles
that prevent some people from participating on a par with others, as
full partners in social interaction\" (SJ 60). In other words, for
Fraser\'s paradigm to function, [**one needs a base-level faith in the
democratic process even as one acknowledges that it is always going to
fall short** of its own ideals.]{.underline} Like Levinasian justice,
which knows that it will never he able to live up to the demands of
ethics, **[concrete democratic formations are invariably
guilty]{.underline}**, humiliated by their failures, **[but this
cannot]{.underline}**, for the Habermasians at least, **[discourage us
to the point that we stop trying to improve them.]{.underline}** As
Benhabib explains: As with any normative model, [one can always point to
prevailing conditions of inequality]{.underline}, hierarchy,
exploitation and domination, [and prove that \"this may be true in
theory but not so in practice\"]{.underline} (Kant). [The
answer]{.underline} to this ancient conflict between norm and reality
[is simply to say that **if all were as it ought to be in the world,
there would be no need to build normative models**]{.underline}, either.
**[The fact that a normative model does not correspond to reality is no
reason to dismiss it]{.underline}**, for the need for normativity arises
precisely because humans measure the reality they inhabit in the light
of principles and promises that transcend this reality. [**The relevant
question** therefore **is: Does a given normative model enable us to
analyze** and distill **the rational principles of existing practices
and institutions in such a fashion that we can then use these** rational
**reconstructions as critical guidelines for measuring really existing
democracies?**]{.underline} 16 Allen sums up the matter by noting that
[**though imbalances of power are important** for Habermasian critical
theory to grapple with, **the solution** to this **\"can only be more
discourse or debate\"**]{.underline} (PS 18). This continued faith in
the perfectibility of the democratic process is what distinguishes the
Habermasian feminists I have cited in this chapter from the thinkers --
perhaps, again, with the exception of Levinas -- I have discussed in
earlier chapters of this book. The latter **[thinkers]{.underline}**, as
well as those aligned with these thinkers, [would]{.underline} in fact
[**ridicule the Habermasian stance for its naive inability to recognize
how power corrupts the democratic process**, how]{.underline}, for
example, [neoliberalism and global capitalism have torn democracy into
shreds.]{.underline} As Wendy Brown explains, \"This is a political
condition in which the substance of many of the significant features of
constitutional and representative democracy have been gutted,
jettisoned, or end- run, even as they continue to be promulgated
ideologically, served as a foil and shield for their undoing and for the
doing of death elsewhere.\" 17 Indeed, what good can the ideal of
participatory parity do in the context of biopolitical and other
invisible forces of power that constitute us as compliant subjects well
before we understand the basic principles of such parity? [If our
psychic lives]{.underline}, including our unconscious desires,
fantasies, and motivations, [are shaped by hegemonic power, then
participatory parity seems like a mere stopgap measure]{.underline} --
something that makes us feel slightly better about being nothing but the
obedient marionettes of power. 5 To some degree [I agree with such
pessimism]{.underline} about the Habermasian democratic process. **[But
I am not convinced that the alternative approaches]{.underline}** I have
analyzed in this book necessarily **[fare any better in terms of being
capable of addressing the problem of power.]{.underline}** I have
already explained my reservations about the ability of Zizek and Badiou
to do so. Butler may at first glance seem more competent in this regard,
given that the critique of disciplinary power has always been central to
her theory. Yet, as I have demonstrated, I am not reassured by her
assertion that opposing power is a matter of negotiating with it. Nor am
I persuaded by the haphazardness of her understanding of resistance -- a
haphazardness that arises from her rejection of agency. Take her
assertion that the Benjaminian messianic rupture of divine violence --
outlined in Chapter 3 -- offers the possibility of a political
intervention based on distraction: Perhaps we need to be more
distracted, as Baudelaire was said to be, in order to be available to
the true picture of the past to which Benjamin refers. Perhaps, at some
level that has implications for the political point I hope to bring out
here, a certain disorientation opens us to the chance to wage a fight
for the history of the oppressed.JS **[Butler]{.underline}** here
**[offers disorientation and chance -- rather than action, choice, or
decision]{.underline}** -- **[as a political strategy.]{.underline}** As
she adds, \"We have to be provisional situationists, seizing the chance
to fight when it appears\" (PW 110). This is not a new problem, for long
before Butler\'s turn to ethics, she wrote, in relation to our tendency
to identify with the power structures that subjugate us: \"The very
categories that arc politically available for identification restrict in
advance the play of hegemony, dissonance and rearticulation. It is not
simply that a psyche invests in its oppression, but that the very terms
that bring the subject into political viability orchestrate the
trajectory of identification and become, with luck, the site for a
disidentificatory resistance.\"19 I have already expressed my
dissatisfaction with the idea that the psyche invariably \"invests in
its oppression,\" but in the present instance [I want to call
attention]{.underline} to Butler\'s [reduction of resistance -- here
configured as a practice of disidentification -- to a kind of lucky
break from the generalized background of power.]{.underline} Allen has
noted the same problem, arguing that **[luck is too flimsy a basis for
political resistance]{.underline}**, and pointing out, furthermore, that
Butler\'s **[reluctance to theorize the social world as anything but
hegemonic makes it difficult]{.underline}** for her **[to envision the
possibility of social solidarity, including nonsubordinating,
nonstrategic forms of mutual recognition.]{.underline}** As Allen
asserts: [Without a more fully developed]{.underline} and less
ambivalent [notion of recognition, Butler is]{.underline} left [unable
to explain the possibility of collective or]{.underline}, ultimately,
[individual resistance]{.underline} \.... Without an account of how the
recognition of our commonality provides the basis for political
community and collective resistance, Butler is left suggesting that the
transformation from identification to disidentification, from
signification to resignification, from subjectivation to a critical
desubjectivation, is nothing more than a matter of luck. (PS 93)
Exactly. **[As complicated and potentially flawed as the democratic
ideal of participatory parity may be, it still seems like a better basis
for political action than dumb luck.]{.underline}**

### AT: Identity First

#### Identity support *[alone]{.underline}* leaves students [unprepared]{.underline} to situate their personal experiences within an institutional framework. This shuts down discussions of [solutions]{.underline} and disempowers students' [agency]{.underline}. Political education involving the identification of [specific problems]{.underline} and [concrete policy solutions]{.underline} is the best way to support youth activism. This evidence [beats the case]{.underline} and proves that the [alt is best]{.underline}.

Nurturing Collective Forms of Identity

> yourself. This is about identity development, the history of your
> people, where your people stand in the bigger picture.
>
> ---Staffer at CAPAY (Coalition for Asian Pacific American Youth), in
> Boston, Massachusetts

As evidenced by this quote, [civic activism organizations focus on
raising awareness and strengthening individuals' ability to navigate and
negotiate the challenges they face. In doing so, they seek to "**make
the personal political**" among youth from marginalized social groups in
the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates. Civic activism
organizations recruit youth from marginalized ethnic, racial, or
cultural groups; within our study, there were organizations focused
explicitly on African American, Native American, Asian American, and
gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgendered, and questioning (GLBTQ) identity.
There were other organizations that coalesced around larger identity
categories, such as youth of color.

[We found that there was a clearly defined need for identity support
among the young people within these organizations]{.underline}. Youth we
interviewed described that before joining these groups they had a poor
view of themselves, had been ignorant about their history, and/or had
been involved in self-destructive behaviors. For instance, as one youth
explained, "When I first realized I was queer I felt really powerless
and really scared of myself. And that was really scary; to be scared of
who you are is totally diminishing." Other youth said that they "didn't
know there were so many different kinds of Asians," "didn't know about
self-hatred," or didn't "understand what really happened in the civil
rights movement; schools didn't really give you more than the basics."
The need for identity affirmation, therefore, within these youth
populations was particularly strong. [It is important]{.underline},
however, [to point out that civic activism organizations **moved beyond
mere identity affirmation**, gearing their work in such a way as it
**set the groundwork for a broader social justice
orientation**]{.underline}.

[Most organizations offered "critical education" on prejudice and
discrimination as **an entry point for social justice issues** in order
to help youth understand]{.underline} \[end page 26\] [the legacy of
oppression and **identify present-day challenges** facing their identity
group]{.underline}. One organization, for example, believed that the
barriers faced by African American youth are best addressed once youth
have considered the legacy and impact of their own history, including
the painful scars left by slavery and segregation. They encouraged youth
to reflect on and "heal" these scars so that they could transcend
internalized racism and learn to effectively function in society. This
approach is consistent with Watts et al.'s argument that African
Americans benefit from an understanding of the social structure of power
and privilege. In their struggle against oppression, African Americans
can "benefit from a strong sense of self that incorporates both the
cultural and sociopolitical aspects of their African American heritage"
(2003, p. 188).

[Civic activism organizations move beyond the exploration of the history
of particular identity groups, seeking to emancipate youth through a
process of deep critical analysis and reflection]{.underline}. Some
organizations are intentional about pushing youth out of their "comfort
zone" by asking that they interrogate their assumptions about
themselves, each other, and about the society around them. One youth
captured this aspect of this approach when he said,

> I don't think it's about being comfortable all the time. It's about
> learning different circumstances that make you uncomfortable, where
> you have to stand up for what you say, even if it's not the majority
> opinion. It's about getting over the discomfort you feel.

Thus, [youth within these organizations are pushed to **extend their
thinking**, to confront their own biases, and to ask **hard questions**
of the leaders within their communities]{.underline}. Further, [they
analyze issues of oppression and consider how their own personal
experiences **relate to the struggles of others** within and outside of
their own community. This kind of identity support]{.underline}, in
turn, [creates a sense of purpose in young people to take a civic
activist stance and to work with others in their communities to end
various forms of oppression]{.underline}.

Making Social Change Tangible

> Social change happens at the personal level, at the gut level, and has
> to come out of self-interest. People mobilize because their daughter
> has asthma and they need to do something about it.

---Staffer at 21st Century Youth Leadership Movement, in Selma, Alabama

As captured by this quote, [the desire for social change is often
**rooted in** personal needs and experiences, and as such, connection to
collective forms of identity can be a precursor to social action. Civic
activism, however, also]{.underline} \[end page 27\] [depends on **the
identification of tangible goals for social change**, an articulation of
**a coherent strategy** for reaching those goals, and a belief in **the
power and efficacy of groups of people to effect change**]{.underline}.

Further, we have found that [the social change goals or **"wins"** that
civic activism groups use to measure their own progress are, **by
design, incremental** so that youth can **remain engaged in the
process**]{.underline}. These include press coverage of their issues,
the number of people they recruit to attend rallies or events, and the
number of meetings they hold with people in power. Over the course of
the study, civic activism groups achieved some relatively large-scale
community wins. These include one organization's success in closing down
a cement plant in their community, another's successful defeat of a city
council measure to create a daytime curfew for teens, and a third
organization's successful effort to have a sexual harrassment policy
created for their school district. These types of [victories fueled
young people's **sense of purpose** and their belief that **they could
make a difference**]{.underline}. The following quote from one youth is
illustrative of the sense of enthusiasm and competence that young people
within these groups radiated.

> We have a big voice. There aren't a lot of other youth who are as
> involved as we are\.... But, we're at the point now where we are taken
> seriously. We earned their respect by the actions we take. When we
> were opposing the cement plant, the owner challenged us at a city
> council meeting. He told us to be more "productive." So, we went out
> and got 1,000 sig- natures opposing his plant and that shut him up and
> impressed the city council people.

[Civic activism groups use a variety of strategies to build the capacity
of youth leaders to effect change. One of most **universal and potent
strategies** used by organizing groups is **political education**. This
approach enables youth to learn about **social movements** (e.g., the
civil rights movement), **political processes** (the electoral process)
and **current events** (e.g., racial profiling and the effects of 9/11
on immigrant communities). Through **political education**, youth
organizing groups hope to **support critical-thinking skills** and
**develop values and attitudes that move youth to act against
injustice**. Political education sessions often seek to **make
connections between larger social issues and young people's day-to-day
lives**, and center on such issues as policing, school quality,
environmental justice, and immigrants' rights. **On one level**, youth
are seen as experts on these issues, and they are encouraged to share
their experiences as well as compose and defend their own opinions. **On
another level**, youth are pressed by program leaders to think about
these issues **abstractly**, on a scale **beyond their individual
experience**, including a consideration of the **international or global
characteristics** of power and oppression]{.underline}.

[From **a base of political education**, civic activism groups have
progressed toward the development of **a clear and manageable
community-change**]{.underline} \[end page 28\] [**agenda**. They have
sought]{.underline}, at the most basic level, [to empower youth to take
leadership on issues in their lives, emphasizing their role as
grassroots leaders within their communities]{.underline}. The first step
in that process is to identify the issues most salient to the youth who
participate in the organization. The second step is to ask youth to
actively seek out the perspectives and concerns of other community
members, in an effort to find issues of broad concern that can serve as
the basis for sizable coalitions and collective action. Thus, the issues
that civic activist groups address are reflective of issues that
community members face. The process of listening to and raising
awareness about such issues is seen as a high priority in and of itself.
Issues identified as most relevant to youth and their communities
include the lack of recreational spaces, lack of green spaces,
environmental pollution, sexual harrassment in schools, policing and the
increased incarceration of youth offenders, and unfair working
conditions.

Coaching Strategies for Fostering Lifelong Activism

[Without grounding youth in the larger sociohistorical context of social
movements and introducing them to **concrete strategies for social
change**, impassioned youth **would be at a loss to translate their
ideas and beliefs into action**. Civic activism groups use a variety of
mechanisms or levers]{.underline} ("direct actions") [for
change]{.underline}, including education, letter-writing campaigns,
petitions, public presentations, meetings with people in power,
protests, and boycotts. [In taking such approaches to civic engagement,
youth activism groups dispel some of the stereotypes that characterize
their work as "oppositional." They emphasize the need to **work within
the system** to the extent possible]{.underline} (i.e., through
participation in decision-making bodies), [while always being prepared
to apply pressure from outside the system]{.underline} (i.e., through
protests and boycotts). [In the words of one program director, "We're
clear that **being in the system or out isn't important**. It's a
strategy that's rooted in **systems change** that is
important."]{.underline} Further, civic activism groups embrace a
philosophy of nonviolent and peaceful activism; they are concerned that
youth develop a social justice orientation that is positive and
affirming, because they believe that this is necessary to sustain social
action in the long run. The following quote, by a staff member at one
organization, speaks to this issue:

> We don't organize out of hate, but out of love---our love for people.
> Because hate is very defeating, and can motivate and charge you to do
> something about injustices. But \[we ask youth\], how long is your
> hate going to sustain your commitment to social justice?

Hence, [these organizations]{.underline} promote spiritual and/or human
rights arguments for social justice. In doing so, they [seek to **strike
a delicate balance**, supporting young people's ability and opportunity
to actively question authority **while at the same time** enabling youth
to **resist cynicism that could potentially lead to social distrust
and/or alienation**]{.underline}.

### AT: Limits/Fairness=Exclusionary

#### Limits don't uniquely produce exclusions, those are external features of society that aren't unique to debate and that voting aff can't solve---using a limited topic to develop provisional consensus through reciprocal and fallible argumentation is a [better method]{.underline} of [exposing]{.underline} how those exclusions [function]{.underline} 

**Dahlberg, 14**---Centre for Critical and Cultural Studies, University
of Queensland (Lincoln, "The Habermasian Public Sphere and Exclusion: An
Engagement with Poststructuralist-Influenced Critics", Communication
Theory Volume 24, Issue 1, pages 21--41, February 2014, dml)

Normatively then, [the]{.underline} Habermasian (or
[deliberative]{.underline})4 public [sphere refers to the communicative
space constituted through **rational-critical deliberation** over
**practical problems**, deliberation that leads to **critically
(in)formed public opinion**, which in turn enables the]{.underline}
democratic [**scrutiny** and **guidance** of **official decision-making
processes**. The criteria for rational-critical
deliberation]{.underline} are understood to [involve **inclusive**,
**reasoned**, **reciprocal**, **reflexive**, **sincere**, and
**coercion-free argumentation**]{.underline} (Habermas, 2005, 2006).
[Communicative rationality is supported by open information
flows]{.underline} (publicity), [motivated by the aim of reaching
understanding and agreement]{.underline} (public opinion), [and moved
toward this end by the "**forceless force of the better
argument**"]{.underline} (Habermas, 2005, p. 384). [Claims and
agreements are here **contingent** since **every claim can be met by a
"no"** and every deliberatively achieved agreement can be challenged and
potentially undone]{.underline}. It is important to note that
"[public]{.underline}" here [refers to the mode, rather than the content
or place or medium, of communication]{.underline}. Thus, [the public
sphere may come into existence]{.underline}, for instance, [through
face-to-face]{.underline} or technologically mediated [argumentation
between individuals and within informal groups, or through]{.underline}
the [more organized discussions]{.underline} found in civil society
associations and explicitly political organizations, or through the
reflection and debate engendered by the whole range of mass media forms
and contents---"news, reports, commentaries, scenes and images, and
shows and movies with an informative, polemical, educational, and
entertaining content" (Habermas, 2006, p. 415; see also Habermas, 1996a,
pp. 373--374).

[Habermas does not see rational-critical deliberation]{.underline},
which he also refers to as "communicative rationality," [as
some]{.underline} sort of [metaphysical ideal, but]{.underline} rather
argues that [it can be identified as an idealization implicit in the
"inconspicuous daily routines of asking for and giving
reasons"]{.underline}: It is "built into communicative action"
(Habermas, 2006, p. 413). In other words, [the]{.underline} set of
public sphere [criteria]{.underline} listed above [are, and must be,
**tacitly presupposed** by **anyone engaging in any practical
argument**]{.underline}. As such, [these criteria are **conditions of
possibility** for such engagement, "constitutive of **the game of
argumentation**"]{.underline} (Habermas, 2005, p. 385). These
presupposed criteria, Habermas (1984) argues, can be "rationally
reconstructed"---using the "presuppositional analysis" of "formal
pragmatics"5---from out of everyday arguments, illuminating a universal
public sphere norm that sets out "nonarbitrary standards for the
identification of communication pathologies" (Habermas, 2006, p. 416).
That is, [the implicit idealization provides a **critical ideal** by
which to **evaluate** the **deliberative quality** of actual public
sphere communication and thereby identify communicative]{.underline}
"distortions" or "[deviations]{.underline}" [and associated "moments of
inertia," the latter resulting from a "scarcity of those functionally
necessary resources on which processes of deliberative
opinion]{.underline}- and will-formation significantly
[depend]{.underline}" (Habermas, 1996a, p. 326, drawing on Bernhard
Peters\' work). [Such identification of **limits**]{.underline} in turn
[provides the basis for **reflection** on the **cultivation** of **more
rational-critical deliberation**. The aim of such reflection is **not**
to set out **strict procedures** for deliberation]{.underline}, as is
required in formal decision-making (on this see Habermas, 1996a, pp.
302--308), [but to **identify** the "functionally necessary"
sociopolitical resources]{.underline} (or positive conditions) [needed
to **enhance**]{.underline}---in quality and
quantity---[rational-critical deliberation in everyday practical
argumentation]{.underline} (Chambers, 1996; Habermas, 1996a, p. 325).
Specific resources will depend on context, but according to Habermas
(1996a, 2006; see also Carleheden & Gabriëls, 1996) they will, in
general, include: (first) a mass media system regulated in relation to
the idealized criteria, (second) a network of autonomous civil society
associations supporting communicative reasoning and public opinion
formation, the emergence, reproduction, and influence of which depend on
(third) "a liberal-egalitarian political culture sensitive to problems
affecting society as a whole" (Habermas, 1996a, p. 488), which, in turn,
requires (fourth) social rights to the provision of sustainable living
conditions, and (fifth) a population accustomed to (universal) freedom
and versed in critique.

This deliberative public sphere norm, as already noted, is reconstructed
from presuppositions of actual argumentation. However, there is always a
gap between idealization and practice: "due to their idealizing content,
the universal presuppositions of argumentation can only be approximately
fulfilled" (Habermas, 1996a, p. 178, see also pp. 323--326). As an
idealization, rational-critical deliberation (communicative rationality)
is not burdened by the demands and impediments of everyday communicative
practice, which means the latter always falls short of the idealized
presuppositions that are made. Habermas accepts the impossibility of
realizing the always-already-presupposed idealization of communicative
rationality: "[the public sphere ideal is **not perfectly
reachable**]{.underline}" (Habermas 1992b, p. 477). [This impossibility
is not just due to empirical "distortions]{.underline}" (which will be
discussed further in the next section), [but also to logical
limits]{.underline}: Responding to his critics,6 Habermas has,
particularly in recent times, argued that [communicative rationality,
and]{.underline} thus [the deliberative public sphere]{.underline} norm,
**[cannot be understood as an "end state,"]{.underline}** a "final stage
which can be realized in time" (Habermas as cited in Carleheden &
Gabriëls, 1996, p. 10), because if realized it "would make all further
communication superfluous" (Habermas, 1996b, p. 1518). In other words,
[the full realization of communicative rationality would mean the end of
communication]{.underline}, and human history, [as it would eliminate
those negative social conditions that make communication in social life
necessary]{.underline}, "conditions such as inadequate information,
interpersonal misunderstandings, lack of insight, and so on" (Cooke,
2004, p. 417, referring to Albrecht Wellmer\'s work). [By blocking the
realization of fully rational-critical deliberation, these negative
social conditions ensure that no actual deliberation or agreement can
ever be fully rational, which invites challenges to any democratic
process and agreement]{.underline} ([including over deliberative
criteria]{.underline}), [and calls for ongoing
argumentation]{.underline}. Thus, in parallel with Derridian logic, [the
"unavoidable moments of inertia"]{.underline} (Habermas, 1996a, p. 326)
[of everyday communication, along with the idealized criteria of
communicative rationality that they limit, are conditions of possibility
and impossibility of fully realizing in actual argumentation the
deliberative public sphere]{.underline} norm.

[This]{.underline} deliberative conception of the public sphere
[is]{.underline} seen by advocates as **[radically
democratic]{.underline}**---in the sense of being based solely on the
will of those affected by a dispute---for a number of reasons: First,
[because it conceives of a rational-critical public and associated
public opinion that can **scrutinize**, **inform**, and
**hold**]{.underline} publicly [**accountable** political
decisions]{.underline}; second, [because it sees]{.underline} all
[instituted processes and decisions as **open to contestation**
by]{.underline} any **[excluded voices]{.underline}**; [and]{.underline}
third, [because it understands the **criteria** for **guiding** and
**judging** the deliberative practice of participants as **immanent to
these practices**]{.underline}.

However, poststructuralist-influenced critics, including those focusing
on contemporary communication systems (e.g., Nguyen & Alexander, 1996;
Poster, 1997), see the Habermasian public sphere conception failing to
be as radically democratic due to its not taking full account of
exclusion, both exclusion in everyday deliberative practice and
exclusion resulting directly from the conception\'s formulation. I will
now outline this critique, and examine how Habermasians have responded
and might further respond to it.

The Habermasian public sphere conception and exclusion

Poststructuralist-influenced [critics]{.underline}, generally speaking,
[argue]{.underline} [that]{.underline} by [promoting a universal
rational norm as the basis for public sphere communication]{.underline},
Habermasians make (at least) two fundamental mistakes with respect to
exclusion. First, they [assume the possibility of the
eliminability]{.underline}, or near eliminability, [of exclusions in
actual argumentation]{.underline}, so that given the right conditions we
could approximate (if not fully reproduce) communicative rationality,
[which underestimates the **pervasiveness** of power and the extent of
exclusions in everyday communicative interaction]{.underline} (e.g.,
Flyvbjerg, 2000; Shabani, 2003). Second, and more widely articulated
than the first critique, [the]{.underline} Habermasian public sphere
[norm is **itself seen as exclusionary**, despite its democratic
aims]{.underline}. Poststructuralist-influenced [critics]{.underline},
paralleling feminist concerns (e.g., Dean, 1996; Fraser, 1997; Gould,
1996; Young, 2000) and rhetorical studies critique (e.g., Huspek, 2007a;
Phillips, 1996), [argue that the deliberative public sphere criteria,
which]{.underline} are supposed to [define democratically legitimate
communication and]{.underline} to [differentiate between reasoned
argumentation and coercion, actually support domination and
exclusion]{.underline} (e.g., Coole, 1996; Devenney, 2009; Lyotard,
1984, pp. 65--66; Mouffe, 1999, 2000; Rabinovitch, 2001; Villa, 1992).
[In order to be considered legitimate deliberators, subjects must come
to internalize the rules of the particular form of communication deemed
to be the]{.underline} universally [valid form of]{.underline}
democratic [engagement or be excluded from the public
sphere]{.underline}. As such, the Habermasian public sphere conception
is seen as an exemplary form of what critical theorists would refer to
as ideology (a universal claim obscuring its particularity) and of what
Foucault showed to be the operation of modern disciplinary power---the
deliberative public sphere norm relying on the subjugation of selves
through subjectivation, a normalizing that constitutes subjects as
"rational-critical" communicators (Villa, 1992, p. 715). As a result,
[participants who have internalized modes of communication closer to
what is determined valid are advantaged over others]{.underline}. That
is, in order to be equally included, some participants must be
disciplined more than others---those more accustomed to
rational-critical deliberative forms of communication---so as to be
capable of reproducing the idealized deliberative mode, disciplining
that involves the exclusion or suppression of those voices judged
"illegitimate" (irrational, strategic, private). The problem for
poststructuralist-influenced critics here is not with exclusion per se,
as they see norms as necessarily exclusionary, but with such exclusion
being unaccounted for in relation to democratic communication and in
fact obscured by the claim to universality.

I will briefly outline how Habermas and Habermasians have responded and
might further respond to these two interrelated lines of critique. [In
response to the]{.underline} first line of
[critique]{.underline}---[that the]{.underline} Habermasian [public
sphere]{.underline} conception [does not adequately account for
exclusions]{.underline} in practice---I have already noted how
[Habermas]{.underline} not only [understands]{.underline} [the public
sphere norm]{.underline}, despite being reconstructed from everyday
communicative interaction, [as being logically impossible to fully
realize]{.underline} in practice [but sees "moments of inertia" as
ever-present and **necessary features** of actual
deliberation]{.underline}: [They block the full realization of
communicative rationality and yet **make communication necessary** in
the first place. These]{.underline} moments of inertia [include
**"illegitimate"** exclusion: Any deliberative practice will involve
exclusion]{.underline}, not just "legitimate" exclusion of
"undemocratic" elements but exclusions [defined as "illegitimate" with
respect to the idealization of communicative rationality. Such
"illegitimate" exclusions result from]{.underline}: "unequal
distribution of attention, competencies, and knowledge" (Habermas,
1996a, p. 325); strategic manipulation of various sorts, including
bribes, threats, or violence (Habermas, 1996a, pp. 307--308); and
[systemic coercion]{.underline}---state and corporate interests and
their instrumental media of money and power colonizing more and more
areas of life including those that should, for a healthy democratic
society, be coordinated by public opinion derived from rational-critical
deliberation (for an overview of the forms of distorted communication
identified by Habermas, see Huspek, 2007b, pp. 827--830). In relation to
systemic coercion, Habermas has been particularly critical of the
instrumentalization of communication media: How the potential of the
mass media to support rational-critical deliberation, with maximum
inclusion of voices, is continually thwarted by system colonization, and
particularly the "intrusion of the functional imperatives of the market
economy in the 'internal logic' of the production and presentation of
messages" (Habermas, 2006, p. 422).

As well as exclusion resulting from such explicitly "distorted
communication," Habermasian theory also considers the exclusionary
effects of culturally specific (lifeworld) contexts. [The interpretation
and application of public sphere criteria as well as the validity and
strength of arguments will **always be contextually affected** and
historically specified]{.underline} (Habermas, 1992b, p. 477; 1996a, p.
324). As a result, [what comes to be defined as "legitimate"
deliberation will be colored by taken-for-granted meanings, leading to
some voices being]{.underline} illegitimately (according to the
deliberative public sphere norm) [valorized over others]{.underline},
with the illegitimate marginalization or exclusion of these other
voices.

Thus Habermas (2006) and [adherents are **fully aware** of how public
spheres]{.underline} in practice [are "dominated by the kind of mediated
communication]{.underline} [that lacks the defining features of
deliberation]{.underline}" (p. 414), "the kind of political
communication we know goes against the grain of the normative
requirements of deliberative politics" (p. 420). However, as we have
seen, for Habermasians it is not just culture and power that determine
communicative practice, as some poststructuralist-inspired critique
suggests. Rather, [presuppositions of communicative rationality
are]{.underline} understood as [**implicit in every argument**,
providing a **countervailing force** to distorted communication and the
basis for a]{.underline} postmetaphysical **[critique of
exclusion]{.underline}** and "a potential for self-transformation"
(Habermas, 1992a, pp. 419--429; 1992b, pp. 476--479; 1996a, p. 374,
2006, p. 419; see also Benhabib, 1996; Chambers, 1996; Cooke, 1994). We
can see this historically in the labor and women\'s
[movements]{.underline}, as Habermas (1996a) points out, which [have
been able to draw on "the rights to unrestricted inclusion]{.underline}
and equality [built into liberal **public spheres** . . . in order to
**shatter the structures** that had initially constituted them as 'the
other']{.underline} of a bourgeois public sphere" (p. 374). The central
purpose in reconstructing the public sphere idealization of
rational-critical deliberation, as already outlined in the previous
section, is to illuminate this basis for critique and transformation.
Yet, [poststructuralists see such a universal norm as **in itself
producing exclusions**]{.underline}, exclusions that are not only
unaccounted for but are, in fact, obscured by the claim to universality.
This is the second line of critique outlined above.

In reply to this second line of critique, it must first be noted that
[Habermasians accept that there is a **necessary constitutive
exclusion** involved in the deliberative public sphere
conception]{.underline}. In fact, [any conception of democracy must
involve normative claims about what democracy is and is not, including
**what is acceptable as democratic communication** and what is not,
drawing a line between reasoned argumentation and coercion]{.underline},
democratically "legitimate" and "illegitimate" exclusion. [It
is]{.underline} simply [**not possible** to call on democracy and
**escape invoking a norm** of democratic communication with **associated
exclusions**. The question is then whether we can]{.underline}, as
Habermas claims, [reconstruct]{.underline} from everyday communicative
practice [a]{.underline} universal [norm]{.underline} of the public
sphere [that distinguishes between democratically "legitimate" and
"illegitimate" exclusion.]{.underline}

According to Habermas (1992a), [not only can we reconstruct such a norm,
but the public sphere norm thus identified is **not normalizing** in the
**disciplinary** and **exclusionary sense** suggested by
the]{.underline} poststructuralist [critique]{.underline}. Of course,
[**any norm will require certain behavior** from participants, and thus
**the constitution of subjectivity** in **particular ways**. But
Habermasians **do not see such requirements** and
constitution]{.underline} [as]{.underline} necessarily
**[antidemocratic]{.underline}**. More specifically, [they do not see
the deliberative public sphere norm as **having to be internalized** in
a **disciplinary** and exclusionary **fashion**]{.underline}. Rather,
[they see it as **an always already presupposed communicative
structure** that can be **explicitly reconstructed** as a **critical
ideal** by which to **illuminate "illegitimate exclusion"** within
deliberation specifically, and society more generally, and enable
**reflection upon possibilities** for **greater freedom** and
equality]{.underline} (Habermas, 1996a; Markell, 1997). As Chambers
(1996) argues, [rational-critical deliberation]{.underline} here [is
about "the endless questioning of codes," **the reasoned questioning of
normalization** and thus of **exclusions**]{.underline} (pp. 233--234).
[Through deliberation, participants presuppose themselves as
**rational-critical subjects**]{.underline} (and in the process are
constituted as such), [able to **reflexively interrogate**]{.underline}
all aspects of [their situation, including the **particular deliberative
rules** applied in practical disputes]{.underline}. Of course, as
critics point out, [subjects whose everyday communicative practice is
already more in line with the deliberative public sphere norm will be
**advantaged over others**]{.underline} in becoming such
rational-critical interlocutors. [However]{.underline}, for
Habermasians, [it is **not** the reconstructed **norm** that should be
seen as at fault---seeing the reconstructed norm marginalizing or
excluding voices---but the **uneven distribution** of the sociocultural
resources **necessary for engaging in rational-critical
deliberation**]{.underline} (that fall under the five general positive
conditions of the public sphere listed in the previous section). [This
unevenness]{.underline}, which is in fact highlighted by the Habermasian
public sphere norm in its critical role, [indicates the need to provide
for these resources so as to **enhance** and **extend communicative
rationality**]{.underline}. That is, we are faced here with a
sociological problem, one that the Habermasian public sphere norm
illuminates and demands be addressed for the advancement of democracy,
rather than a problem internal to the character of the norm.

### AT: Personal Experience First

#### Positioning of experience as a justification for belief creates a self-referential insulation from criticism \["How can you know how I felt? You can't criticize how I felt!"\] and prevents meaningful criticism of the status quo which can always be rendered as purely subjective -- any theory of politics that takes as transparent the meaning of personal experience can only but naturalize the categories it attempts to criticize. 

**Scott 97.** Joan Scott, Professor of History at Princeton, 1997,
Feminists Theorize the Political, "Experience"

[When the evidence offered is **the evidence of
"experience**]{.underline}," [the claim for **referentiality** is
further **buttressed**]{.underline} -- **[what could be
truer]{.underline}**, after all, **[than a subject\'s own account of
what he or she has lived through]{.underline}**? It is precisely [this
kind of appeal to experience as **uncontestable evidence** and as an
**originary point of explanation**]{.underline} -- [as foundation upon
which analysis is based]{.underline} -- **[that weakens the critical
thrust of histories of difference]{.underline}**. By [remaining within
the **epistemological frame of orthodox history**]{.underline}, [these
studies **lose the possibility of examining those assumptions** and
practices that **excluded considerations of difference** in the first
place]{.underline}. **[They take as self-evidence the identities of
those whose experience is being documented and thus naturalize their
difference]{.underline}**. [They **locate resistance outside its
discursive construction** and **reify agency** as an **inherent**
attribute of individuals, thus decontextualizing it]{.underline}. [When
**experience** is taken as the **origin** or **knowledge**]{.underline},
[the vision of the **individual subject**]{.underline} (the person who
had the experience of the historian who recounts it) [becomes the
bedrock of evidence upon which explanation is built]{.underline}.
**[Questions about the constructed nature of experience, about how
subjects are constituted as different in the first place, about how
one\'s vision is structured -- about language (or discursive) and
history -- are left aside]{.underline}**. [The **evidence of
experience** then becomes **evidence for the fact of difference** rather
than a way of **exploring how difference is established**, how it
**operates**, how and in what ways it **constitutes subjects** who see
and act in the world]{.underline}.

To put it another way, [the **evidence of experience**, whether
**conceived through a metaphor of visibility** or in any other way that
**takes meaning as transparent**, **reproduces rather than contests
given ideological system**]{.underline}- [those that assume that the
facts of history speak for themselves and]{.underline}, in the case of
histories of gender, [those that rest on notions of a natural or
established opposition between sexual practices and social conventions,
and between homosexuality and heterosexuality]{.underline}. Histories
that document the hidden world of homosexuality, for example, show the
impact of silence and repression on the lives of those affected by it
and bring to light the history of their suppression and exploitation.
**[But the project of making experience visible precludes critical
examination of the workings of the ideological system itself, it\'s
categories of representation (homosexual/heterosexual, man/woman,
black/white as fixed immutable identities), its premises about what
these categories mean and how they operate, its notions of subjects,
origin, and cause]{.underline}**.

[The project of making experience visible precludes analysis of the
workings of this system and of its historicity; **instead it reproduces
its terms**]{.underline}. We come to appreciate the consequences of the
closeting of homosexuals and we understand repression as an interested
act of power or domination; alternative behaviors and institutions also
become available to us. [What we don\'t have is a way of placing those
alternatives within the framework of (historically contingent) dominant
patterns of sexuality and the ideology that supports them. **We know
they exist, but not the extent of the critique**]{.underline}. Making
visible the experience of a different group exposes the existence of
repressive mechanisms, but not their inner workings or logics; [we know
that difference exists, but we don\'t understand it as constituted
relationally]{.underline}. [For that **we need to attend to the
historical processes that, through discourse, position subjects and
produce their experiences**.]{.underline} [It is not individuals who
have experience, but **subjects who are constituted through
experience**]{.underline}. [Experience in this definition then becomes
not the origin of our explanation, not the authoritative (because seen
or felt) evidence that grounds what is know, but rather what we seek to
explain, **that about which knowledge is produced**]{.underline}. [To
think about experience in this way is **to historicize it** as well as
to **historicize the identities** it produces]{.underline}. This kind of
historicizing represents a reply to the many contemporary historians who
have argued that an unproblematized "experience" is the foundation of
their practice; it is a historicizing that implies critical scrutiny of
all explanatory categories usually taken for granted, including the
category of "experience"

### AT: Predictability/Rules Bad

#### No link---our argument is a set of contestable guidelines for competitions. Only a standard like the resolution is limited enough to enable prep AND creativity

**Armstrong 2K** -- Paul B. Armstrong, Professor of English and Dean of
the College of Arts and Sciences at the State University of New York at
Stony Brook, Winter 2000, "The Politics of Play: The Social Implications
of Iser\'s Aesthetic Theory," New Literary History, Vol. 31, No. 1, p.
211-223

\*aleatory = depending on luck, i.e. the throw of a die

[Such a play-space]{.underline} also [opposes the notion that the only
alternative to]{.underline} the [coerciveness of consensus must
be]{.underline} to advocate the [sublime]{.underline} powers of
[rule-breaking]{.underline}.8 Iser shares Lyotard's concern that to
privilege harmony and agreement in a world of heterogeneous language
games is to limit their play and to inhibit semantic innovation and the
creation of new games. Lyotard's endorsement of the "sublime"---the
[pursuit of the "unpresentable" by rebelling against
restrictions]{.underline}, defying norms, and smashing the limits of
existing paradigms---[is undermined by contradictions]{.underline},
however, which Iser's explication of play recognizes and addresses. The
paradox of the unpresentable, as Lyotard acknowledges, is that [it can
only be manifested through a game of representation]{.underline}. The
sublime is, consequently, in Iser's sense, an instance of doubling. [If
violating norms creates new games, this crossing of boundaries **depends
on** and carries in its wake the]{.underline} conventions and
[structures it oversteps]{.underline}. The sublime may be
uncompromising, asocial, and unwilling to be bound by limits, but [its
pursuit of what is not contained in any order]{.underline} or system
[makes it dependent on the forms it opposes]{.underline}. ¶ [The
radical]{.underline} presumption of the sublime [is not only terroristic
in refusing to recognize]{.underline} the [claims of other games whose
rules it declines to limit itself by. It is also naive and
self-destructive in its]{.underline} impossible [imagining that it can
do without the others it opposes]{.underline}. As a structure of
doubling, the sublime pursuit of the unpresentable requires a play-space
that includes other, less radical games with which it can interact. Such
[conditions of exchange would be provided by]{.underline} the
[nonconsensual reciprocity of]{.underline} Iserian [play]{.underline}. ¶
Iser's notion of [play]{.underline} offers a way of conceptualizing
power which [acknowledges the necessity]{.underline} and force [of
disciplinary constraints without seeing them as]{.underline}
unequivocally [coercive]{.underline} and determining. [The]{.underline}
contradictory [combination of restriction and openness]{.underline} in
how play deploys power [is evident]{.underline} in Iser's analysis of
"regulatory" and "aleatory" rules. [Even the regulatory rules, which set
down the conditions]{.underline} participants submit to [in order to
play a game, "permit a]{.underline} certain [range of
combinations]{.underline} while also establishing a code of possible
play. . . . Since [these rules limit the text game without producing
it,]{.underline} they are regulatory but not prescriptive. They do no
more than set the aleatory in motion, and the aleatory rule differs from
the regulatory in that it has no code of its own" (FI 273). [Submitting
to]{.underline} the discipline of [regulatory restrictions is both
constraining and enabling because it makes possible certain kinds of
interaction that the rules cannot completely predict or prescribe in
advance. Hence]{.underline} the existence of aleatory [rules that are
not codified]{.underline} as part of the game itself [but
are]{.underline} the [variable]{.underline} customs,
[procedures]{.underline}, and practices for playing it. [Expert facility
with aleatory rules marks the difference]{.underline}, for example,
[between someone who just knows the rules of a game and another who
really knows how to play it. Aleatory rules are more
flexible]{.underline} and openended and more susceptible to variation
than regulatory rules, [but they too are characterized by]{.underline} a
contradictory combination of [constraint and possibility, limitation and
unpredictability]{.underline}, discipline and spontaneity.

### AT: Switch Side Negates Identity

#### At worst we require a "devils advocate" -- which is on balance good for activism---their ethics args are bad for the aff itself

**Haskell 1990** -- history professor at Rice University (May, Thomas,
History and Theory, 29.2, "Objectivity is Not Neutrality: Rhetoric vs.
Practice in Peter Novick's That Noble Dream", p. 129-157)

[Detachment functions in this manner **not by draining** us of
**passion,** but by helping to **channel** our intellectual passions in
such a way as **to insure collision** with rival perspectives. In that
collision]{.underline}, if anywhere, [our thinking transcends both the
idiosyncratic and the conventional.]{.underline} Detachment both
socializes and deparochializes the work of intellect; it is the quality
that fits an individual to participate fruitfully in what is essentially
a communal enterprise. Objectivity is so much a product of social
arrangements that individuals and particular opinions scarcely deserve
to be called objective, yet the [social arrangements that foster
objectivity have no basis for existence apart from individual striving
for detachment. Only insofar as the members of the community are
disposed to]{.underline} [set aside the perspective that
comes]{.underline} most [spontaneously to them]{.underline}, and [strive
to see things in a detached light, is there any likelihood that they
will engage with one another mentally and provoke one another through
mutual criticism to the most complete, least idiosyncratic, view that
humans are capable of.]{.underline} [When the]{.underline} ascetic
[effort]{.underline} at detachment [fails,]{.underline} as it often
does, [**we \"talk past one another**,\" producing nothing]{.underline}
but discordant soliloquies, each fancying itself the voice of reason.
The kind of thinking I would call objective leads only a fugitive
existence outside of communities that enjoy a high degree of
independence from the state and other external powers, and which are
dedicated internally not only to detachment, but also to intense mutual
criticism and to the protection of dissenting positions against the
perpetual threat of majority tyranny. Some hypothetical examples may
clarify what I mean by objective thinking and show how remote it is from
neutrality. [Consider]{.underline} an extreme case: [the person who,
although capable of detachment, suspends]{.underline} his or her own
[perceptions]{.underline} of the world [not in the expectation of
gaining]{.underline} a broader [perspective, but only]{.underline} in
order [**to learn how opponents think** so as to demolish their
arguments more effectively]{.underline} - who is, in\* short, a
polemicist, deeply and fixedly committed as a lifelong project to a
particular political or cultural or moral program. Anyone choosing such
a life obviously risks being thought boorish or provincial, but insofar
as such a person successfully enters into the thinking of his or her
rivals and produces arguments potentially compelling not only to those
who already share the same views, but to outsiders as well, I see no
reason to withhold the laurel of objectivity. 10 [There is nothing
objective about hurling imprecations at apostates]{.underline} or
catechizing the faithful, [but as long as the polemicist truly engages
the thinking of the enemy he or she is being as objective as
anyone.]{.underline} In contrast, [the person too enamored of his or her
own interpretation of things seriously and sympathetically **to
entertain alternatives, even for the sake of learning** how best to
defeat them, fails my test of objectivity, no matter how serene and even
tempered.]{.underline} The most common failure of objectivity is
preaching to the converted, proceeding in a manner that complacently
presupposes the pieties of one\'s own coterie and makes no effort to
appreciate or appeal to the perspectives of outsiders. In contrast, the
most commonly observed fulfillment of the ideal of objectivity in the
historical profession is simply the powerful argument-the text that
reveals by its every twist and turn its respectful appreciation of the
alternatives it rejects. Such a text attains power precisely because its
author has managed to suspend momentarily his or her own perceptions so
as to anticipate and take account of objections and alternative
constructions -not those of some straw man, but those that truly issue
from the rival\'s position, understood as sensitively and stated as
eloquently as the rival him- or herself could desire. [Nothing is
rhetorically more powerful than this, and nothing, not even capitulation
to the rival, could acknowledge any more vividly the force and
respectability of the rival\'s perspective. To]{.underline} mount a
telling [attack]{.underline} on [a position, one must first inhabit it.
Those so habituated to their customary intellectual abode that they
cannot even explore others can **never be persuasive** to anyone but
fellow habitues. That is why powerful arguments are often more faithful
to the complexity and fragility of historical interpretation - more
faithful even to the irreducible plurality of human perspectives, when
that is, in fact, the case -than texts that abjure position-taking
altogether and ostentatiously wallow in displays of \"reflexivity\" and
\"undecidability.\"]{.underline} [The powerful argument is the
highest]{.underline} fruit of the kind of [thinking I would call
objective, and]{.underline} in it **[neutrality plays no
part]{.underline}**. Authentic objectivity has simply nothing to do with
the television newscaster\'s mechanical gesture of allocating the same
number of seconds to both sides of a question, or editorially splitting
the difference between them, irrespective of their perceived merits

are in pain - assertions for which there are data to serve as grist for

[\"Other people hurt too\"?]{.underline} Or, most dangerously - and
perhaps most tellingly - \"What do you expect when you keep shooting
yourself in the foot?\" If the majority were perceived as having the
well- being of minority groups in mind, these responses might be
acceptable, even welcomed. And they might lead to real conversation.
But, [writes Williams, the failure by those \"cushioned within the
invisible privileges of race and power]{.underline}\... to incorporate a
sense of precarious connection as a part of our [lives is\... ultimately
obliterating]{.underline}.\" n74

\"Precarious.\" \"Obliterating.\" [These words will clearly invite
responses only from fools and sociopaths; they will, by **effectively
precluding objection**, disconcert and disunite others]{.underline}.
[\"I hurt,\" in academic discourse, has three broad though interrelated
effects]{.underline}. First, [it demands priority from the reader\'s
conscience. It is for this reason that law review editors, waiving usual
standards, have privileged a long trail of undisciplined - even
silly]{.underline} n75 [- destructive and, above all, self-destructive
arti]{.underline} \[\*695\] [cles.]{.underline} n76 [Second, by
emphasizing the emotional bond between those who hurt in a similar way,
\"I hurt\" discourages fellow sufferers from abstracting]{.underline}
themselves from their [pain in order to gain perspective on their
condition]{.underline}. n77

\[\*696\] [Last, as we have seen, it precludes the possibility of **open
and structured conversation** with others]{.underline}. n78

\[\*697\] [It is because of this conversation-stopping
effect]{.underline} of what they insensitively call \"first-person agony
stories\" [that Farber and Sherry deplore their use.]{.underline} \"The
norms of academic civility hamper readers from challenging the accuracy
of the researcher\'s account; it would be rather difficult, for example,
to criticize a law review article by questioning the author\'s emotional
stability or veracity.\" n79 Perhaps, a better practice would be to put
the scholar\'s experience on the table, along with other relevant
material, but to subject that experience to the same level of scrutiny.

If [through the foregoing rhetorical strategies CRATs succeeded in
limiting academic debate]{.underline}, why do they not have greater
influence on public policy? [Discouraging white legal scholars from
entering the national conversation about race]{.underline}, n80 I
suggest, [has generated a kind of cynicism in white audiences
which]{.underline}, in turn, [has]{.underline} had [precisely the
reverse effect]{.underline} of that ostensibly [desired]{.underline} by
CRATs. [It drives the American public to the right and ensures that
anything CRT offers is reflexively rejected.]{.underline}

In the absence of scholarly work by white males in the area of race, of
course, it is difficult to be sure what reasons they would give for not
having rallied behind CRT. Two things, however, are certain. First, [the
kinds of issues]{.underline} raised by Williams [are too
important]{.underline} in their implications  \[\*698\]  for American
life [to be confined to communities of color.]{.underline} If the lives
of minorities are heavily constrained, if not fully defined, by the
thoughts and actions of the majority elements in society, [it would seem
to be of great importance that white thinkers and doers participate in
open discourse]{.underline} to bring about change. Second, given the
lack of engagement of CRT by the community of legal scholars as a whole,
the discourse that should be taking place at the highest scholarly
levels has, by default, been displaced to faculty offices and, more
generally, the streets and the airwaves.

190-198, dml)

In order to understand the conceptual difference, it is important to
note that when Baudrillard speaks of the law, he is not referring to law
only in the strictly judicial meaning of the term. Baudrillard is rather
drawing on a psychoanalytical tradition from Freud and Lacan in which
the concept of [law stands for]{.underline} any kind of [**social
regularity**, such as prohibitions, norms, values]{.underline}, morals,
conventions, and so on, [that structures the way we act and construct
meaning in society]{.underline}. Law constitutes the social order of
society.

Viewed from the perspective of an individual immersed in the daily life
of society, [the difference between]{.underline} the
**[law]{.underline}** of society [and the **rule** of the game is a
difference between **necessity** and **arbitrariness**. The law consists
**not only** of]{.underline} a series of [**prohibitions** and
**norms**. It carries also an **account** of the **justification** and
**rationality** of the law. The law tells us not only what we **should**
and **should not** do; it tells us **also why**]{.underline} we should
or should not do this or that. [The law claims to be valid and necessary
regardless of the opinions held by the individual subject included in
the law. The necessity of law is founded on transcendence]{.underline}.
This may be the transcendence of a religious order, a principle of
reason and rationality, or a system of tradition. In any case [the law
justifies itself with reference to some order **beyond the immediate
content** of itself]{.underline}.

[Contrary to the law, the game and the rule are **characterized by their
arbitrariness**. The rule claims **no justification** beyond its
**immediate appearance**]{.underline}. It does not profess to represent
a higher religious order or rational principle. In this way [the rule is
**purely immanent to the game**]{.underline}. Furthermore, [the rule
tells the subject engaged in the game what to do and not to do, but it
**does not** give]{.underline} him \[[them\] any reasons
**why**]{.underline} he \[[they\] should follow the rule]{.underline}.
When asked, [the rule provides **no other justification** for itself
than the **mere reference to the game** itself]{.underline}: "Because
these are the rules of the game!" Baudrillard sums up the difference
between the rule and the law: "The Rule plays on an immanent sequence of
arbitrary signs, while the Law is based on a transcendent sequence of
necessary signs."4

Think of the very simple game you can play when walking on the street in
which you are not allowed to step on the lines between the flags of the
pavement. The game is instituted by the invocation of the rule "Don't
step on the lines!" This rule is purely arbitrary. The game could be
played just as well with the complete opposite rule: "You must step on a
line for every single step you take!" Furthermore, the rule gives no
reason that it should be followed. It has no "formal, moral or
psychological structure or superstructure"5 to support its functioning.
[The functioning of the game is **dependent** on the **voluntary
submission** to the rule by the players engaging in the
game]{.underline}.

[Compare this to]{.underline} the traffic **[regulations]{.underline}**
prescribed by law: "Don't walk in the street." "Cross the street only at
the green light." [These]{.underline} regulations [apply
**unconditionally** and **must be obeyed** by anyone regardless of
whether]{.underline} he wants \[[they want\] to or not]{.underline}.
Traffic [regulations come with]{.underline} a series of explicit and
implicit **[reasons why they should be followed]{.underline}**, [for
instance, that they secure the social order]{.underline} of the traffic
situation [for the safety of everyone]{.underline}.

The transcendence of law makes the validity of law unconditional. It is
not up to the individual subject of law to decide whether he wants to
submit to the law or not. [Conversely, the **purely arbitrary
character** of the rule **sets free the subject** and **leaves it up to
the individual** whether]{.underline} he [\[they\] wants to participate
in the game and become obliged by the rules of the game or
not]{.underline}. In Homo Ludens Huizinga indeed proposes voluntariness
and freedom as the first in his list of characteristics of play.6

"because it's fun"

Law as understood by Baudrillard not only constitutes society. In the
psychoanalytic tradition that Baudrillard is drawing on, law also plays
a crucial role in the very constitution of the subject. To be a subject
is to be subject to law. Without law, there would be no subject.

At first glance, law manifests itself as a prohibition banning our
access to certain objects and acts. We may think of the law as an
institution necessary in order to discipline our wild and otherwise
uncontrolled desires for different forbidden things such as other
people's property (Thou shalt not steal) or transgressive sexual acts
(Thou shalt not commit adultery). In this line of thinking, a society
without law would be an anarchical allagainst-all with everybody
satisfying her every desire at the expense of everybody else.

However, working along similar lines as Baudrillard, Zizek argues that
law has also the latent function of structuring our very being as
subjects since the law is what institutes our desires in the first
place. When the law tells us not to do this or that, it carries an
underlying fantasmatic message promising that beyond the prohibition of
the law lie the objects that may satisfy the desire of the subject.
Inherent in the law is the fantasy of what might happen if the law was
not there to prevent me from pursuing my immediate desires.

As was the case with the concept of law, it is important to note that
the concept of fantasy differs from its usual meaning. Here is how Zizek
explains the term:

Fantasy is usually c\]onceived as a scenario that realizes the subject's
desire. This elementary definition is quite adequate, on condition that
we take it literally, what the fantasy stages is not a scene in which
our desire is fulfilled, fully satisfied, but on the contrary, a scene
that realizes, stages, the desire as such. The fundamental point of
psychoanalysis is that desire is not something given in advance, but
something that has to be constructed---and it is precisely the role of
fantasy to give the coordinates of the subject's desire, to specify its
object, to locate the position the subject assumes in it. It is only
through fantasy that the subject is constituted as desiring: through
fantasy, we learn how to desire.7

Based on this understanding, Zizek often uses the concept of fantasy in
conjunction with the concept of ideology.8 Only on a very superficial
level is fantasy opposed to law in the sense that we fantasize about the
transgression or even the abolition of law. We might think here of
consumerist fantasies of the kind where we imagine gaining access to
products that we cannot afford to buy: "If only the law of property or
the law of equivalences did not prevent me from having this sweater or
that car I would . . ." On another level, fantasy and law work together
in structuring the desire of the subject. By restraining the subject's
access to the objects of desire designated by fantasy, law prevents the
subject from realizing that the qualities and possibilities for
enjoyment imagined to belong to the object are in fact projections of
the subject's own fantasy. In this way, the different laws of the market
restraining our access to consumer goods are the condition of
possibility for the fantasmatic projections about the amount of
happiness, enjoyment, and fulfillment we would attain if we had free and
unlimited access to these goods.

The idea of law instituting order in an otherwise anarchical world of
unrestrained desire (e.g., in Hobbes) is actually a myth produced in the
domain of fantasy and ideology. First, [the myth **gives legitimacy to
law** by explaining **why it is necessary**]{.underline}, but second and
perhaps more importantly [the myth tells us **what we would really
want** if it were not for the law restraining us]{.underline}. Thus,
[the message of the law is **split** into the **explicit prohibition**
and the **fantasmatic injunction** to transgress the law]{.underline}.9
In this way law interacts with fantasy in the domain of ideology in
order to teach the subject what and how to desire.

An important implication of this understanding of the relation between
fantasy and law is that [even in transgression, the subject **does not
move beyond the domain of law**]{.underline}. A thief illegally
appropriating consumer goods by transgressing the law of property does
not violate the fundamental principles for the structuring of desire in
the consumer society. It may in fact even be argued that his
transgressive act confirms the desirability of the consumer goods. Since
the thief will go to such extremities in order to attain the goods, the
goods must indeed be something extraordinary.

In Baudrillard's analysis of the difference between law and rule, we
find the following reflection related to transgression: Ordinarily [we
live within the realm of the Law, **even when fantasizing its
abolition**. Beyond the law we see **only its transgression** or the
**lifting of a prohibition**]{.underline}. For [the discourse of law and
interdiction **determines the inverse discourse** of transgression and
liberation]{.underline}. [However, it is not the absence of the law that
is opposed to the law, but the Rule]{.underline}.10

Instead of transgression or absence of law, Baudrillard suggests the
rule as being opposed to law. The argument is here not that by following
the rule of the game, the player is violating the law of society. The
point is rather the much more subtle one that [by entering the sphere of
the rule and the game the player moves **beyond the ideological domain
of the law**]{.underline}.

Law, desire, and subjectivity tie into each other in a kind of Gordian
knot. In the game, where law is substituted for the rule, this knot is
cut. In its explicit contingency, the rule is not supported by fantasy.
[The rule **does not** hold a **promise of satisfaction**; no sublime
object is imagined beyond the rule. The rule claims to be **nothing more
than what it is**]{.underline}.

So what is the attraction of the rule and the game, if not satisfaction
of a desire? [Entering the game means **voluntarily submitting** to an
**arbitrary rule** with **no higher meaning**. This act is]{.underline},
however, [a way of **delivering oneself from the law**. Since
transgression is **already inscribed** in the law **even in the
violation** of a prohibition, we are **still caught in the web of the
law** and its **matrix of satisfaction/unsatisfaction**. In the
violation, we may contradict the explicit word of the law but we are
**still confirming its underlying principle** of desire.]{.underline}

[When choosing to submit to the rules of a game]{.underline}, however,
[we **step into another order** not structured by the law and desire. We
**renounce our desire**]{.underline}, not in an ascetic abstinence from
particular objects of desire (which is by the way only an extreme
sublimation of the objects of desire), but [by **letting ourselves be
seduced** into an order not promising **any kind of satisfaction at
all**]{.underline}. In this way, [we **move beyond** the law's matrix of
satisfaction/unsatisfaction]{.underline}. When obeying the law, our
conscious rational belief in it is supported by an unacknowledged
irrational belief. Yet, [entering the game, we **openly acknowledge**
the **pure contingency** of the rule, and so our conscious submission to
it is based on **no belief whatsoever**. We have **no illusions** that
the game is **nothing but an illusion**]{.underline}, and so our
approach to the game is perhaps more "realistic" than our approach to
the law.

[The game's **sole principle** . . . is that by choosing the rule one is
**delivered from the law**]{.underline}. Without a psychological or
metaphysical foundation, the rule has no grounding in belief. [One
**neither believes** nor **disbelieves** a rule---**one observes
it**]{.underline}. The diffuse sphere of belief, [the need for
credibility that encompasses the real, is **dissolved in the game**.
Hence their immorality: to proceed without believing in it, to sanction
a direct fascination with conventional signs and groundless
rules]{.underline}.11

In the game, [desire is **suspended** and so is]{.underline} desire's
eternal shadow figure, **[unsatisfaction]{.underline}**, which is a
necessary condition for the reproduction of desire. [In the game, there
is **no promise** and therefore **no disappointment**. In the order of
the law, we may find enjoyment in the **momentary** and **partial
satisfaction** of our desires through obtainment of different objects.
The joy of the game stems **not** from this kind of satisfaction but
**exactly from**]{.underline} the **[suspension]{.underline}** [of the
satisfaction/unsatisfaction matrix]{.underline}.

In order to understand the intensity of ritual forms, one must rid
oneself of the idea that all happiness derives from nature, and all
pleasure from the satisfaction of a desire. On the contrary, [games, the
sphere of play, reveal a **passion for rules**, a **giddiness born of
rules**, and a force that comes from **ceremony**, and **not
desire**]{.underline}.12

As an equivalent to the "giddiness" of which Baudrillard speaks here, we
find in Huizinga's characteristic of play the notion of "fun." [People
play games **because it is fun**. Rather than providing a **full** and
**conclusive explanation** for the engagement in games, the concept of
fun seems to **mark the limitation** of such an explanation. "The fun of
playing]{.underline}," Huizinga notes, "[**resists all analysis**, **all
logical interpretation**]{.underline}."13

Think again of the game Don't Step on the Lines. [Why would someone
engage in this game?]{.underline} Why would someone chose to submit
himself to the stupid and completely arbitrary rule of not stepping on
the lines? [In the obvious absence of sanctions, potential rewards or
other kinds of meaningful satisfactions, the question can only be
answered: "**Because it's fun**."]{.underline} This, however, is
probably more of a displacement of the question than an actual answer.

In the tradition of psychoanalysis, we find also the concept of drive.
Drive is opposed to desire insofar as desire is focused on a particular
object imagined to provide satisfaction for the desire, whereas drive is
not directed at any object. Drive is a short circuit unmediated by
fantasy, where the joy of an act derives from the activity of acting
itself. Here is how Zizek defines the difference between drive and
desire:

[Drive]{.underline} . . . [stands for the]{.underline} paradoxical
[possibility that the subject]{.underline}, forever prevented from
achieving his Goal (and thus fully satisfying his desire),
[can]{.underline} nevertheless [**find satisfaction** in
the]{.underline} very circular [movement of **repeatedly missing its
object**]{.underline}, of circulating around it.14

The point is here of course that the concept of [drive as opposed to
desire **provides an account of fun**]{.underline} as opposed to the
meaning of ordinary goal-oriented behavior. Here is how the distinction
between goal-oriented desire and self-propelling drive turns out in the
words of the legendary poker player Nick "The Greek" Dandalos: "[The
**next best thing** to]{.underline} gambling and [winning
is]{.underline} gambling and **[losing]{.underline}**."15

game as parody

We have seen that the rule is opposed to the law and that the choice of
the rule delivers the player from the ideology of law. What does this
say about the relation between game and society? We might for a brief
moment be tempted to proclaim the playing of games as an act of
criticism toward the ideology of society. This, however, would be
jumping ahead, and it would fit very badly with the actual position held
by different games in our society. How would we think, for instance, of
Champions League football as a form of resistance toward society?
Furthermore, our analysis has just shown that [the domain of the rule
and fun is characterized by **arbitrariness** and **absence of
meaning**]{.underline}. Hence, [it would be **contradictory** to project
a certain **critical** and **normative intentionality** into the **mere
engagement in a game**]{.underline}.

At the same time, the analyses carried out in this book are motivated by
the assumption that there is indeed some kind of sociologically
significant relation between the games played in society and society as
a whole. This assumption is shared by Huizinga, whom we have already
quoted saying: "All play means something."16 [In order to **avoid the
pitfalls** of **formally fixating** the normativity of the meaning of
games in relation to society]{.underline} [by making]{.underline}
general [statements such as: "games constitute a critique of the
ideology of society]{.underline}," "games constitute a celebration of
societal values," "games constitute a way of governing the subjects of
society," "games constitute a way of opposing dominant power structures
of society," and so on, we shall once again turn to Baudrillard for
conceptual support:

[The rule functions as the **parodic simulacrum** of the law.
**Neither** an **inversion** nor **subversion** of the law, but its
**reversion in simulation**]{.underline}. The pleasure of the game is
twofold: the invalidation of time and space within the enchanted sphere
of an indestructible form of reciprocity---pure seduction---and the
parodying of reality, the formal outbidding of the law's constraints.17

Insofar as the game emerges as the institution of an extra set of rules
governing the subject, it seems to constitute an addition to the order
of the law. Perhaps the social significance of the game lies, however,
in the subtraction of fantasmatic ideology from the prescriptions of
law. [**On an immediate level**, the rules of a game **look like the
law** of society. The rule]{.underline} "Don't step on the lines"
**[looks like the regulation]{.underline}** "Only walk on a green
light." However, on closer inspection [the rule **lacks the fantasmatic
support of ideology**. The game thus presents the rule in its **naked
arbitrariness**]{.underline}.

[To the extent that the rules of a game **carry some similarity** to
particular laws of society, the institution of the game may **affect**
and **transform our view** of the **particular law**. The **subtraction
of ideology** in the game may **make us aware** of the **ideological
dimension** of the law, thus causing us to view the law in **the same
"naked arbitrariness" as the rule**]{.underline}.

According to Zizek, [any law is **inherently contradictory** and
basically founded on a **violent** and **illegitimate move** in which
law constitutes itself as law]{.underline}. The obvious example here is
of course [the allegedly humanistic laws of democracy]{.underline},
which [are **founded on**]{.underline} the cruel, violent, and anything
but democratic **[brutality]{.underline}** of the French Revolution.
Underneath the surface of the normal, rational, legitimate, universal
law lies a traumatic truth about the abnormal, irrational, illegitimate,
contingent foundation of the law, and [for law to **function** this
traumatic truth must **remain concealed**]{.underline}. Zizek states:
"Every reign of law has its hidden roots in such an
absolute---selfreferential, self-negating---crime by means of which
crime assumes the form of law, and if the law is to reign in its
'normal' form, this reverse must be unconditionally repressed."18 [The
function of ideology is to **conceal the traumatic contradictions** of
law in order for law to function in a smooth and orderly
fashion]{.underline}.

[When the rule]{.underline}, in the words of Baudrillard, [functions as
the **parodic simulacrum** of the law, it **simulates the law** in the
context of the play world]{.underline}. Since the play world is devoid
of the fantasmatic projections of ideology, the rule stands forth in a
more "naked" appearance than the way we are used to seeing the law. [The
rule of the game **mimics law**. It **does not pretend to be law**. In
fact, the rule does not pretend to be **anything more** or **less** than
what it is]{.underline}.

[Given that the rule is **conventional** and **arbitrary**, and has **no
hidden truth**, it knows **neither repression** nor the **distinction**
between the **manifest** and the **latent**. It **does not carry any
meaning**, it does not lead anywhere; by contrast, the Law has a
**determinate finality**]{.underline}.19

[The **absence** of any kind of **justification** or **rationalization**
transcending the rule **produces a vacuum** around the
game]{.underline}. Contrary to the laws of the social order, [the game
**does not explain** or **account for itself**. It merely **offers
itself**]{.underline}. Consequently, [the game **does not pass** any
**critical** or **normative judgment** on the law and society. However,
the **vacuum** produced by the rule--- the space devoid of ideology
constituted by the game---**opens the potential** for **critical
reflections** on the nature of law and society]{.underline}. Indeed,
[these reflections **cannot be made** from **within the game**. The game
**merely opens the space** for such reflections]{.underline}.

### XT---Baudrillard Votes Neg

#### Game-playing DA -- 

#### 1. We should not seek meaning nor should we move towards a legitimate engagement with alterity. Rather, debate should be as a ritual dramaturgy wherein we submit absolutely and totally submit to the rules of the game as a transgression of the law. The only impact to game playing is the ability to lose oneself in total submission to the rules.

**Baudrillard 79.** Jean, Seduction, pg. 131-3

The Diary of the Seducer claims that in seduction the subject is never
the master of his master plan, and even when the latter is deployed in
full consciousness, it still submits to the rules of a game that goes
beyond it . [A ritual dramaturgy beyond the law, seduction is both game
and fate, and as such pushes the protagonists towards their inevitable
end without the rule being broken - for it is the rule that binds them.
And the rule\'s basic dictum is that the game continue]{.underline}
whatever the cost, be it death itself. There is, then, a sort of passion
that binds the players to the rule that ties them together - [without
which the game would not be possible.]{.underline} [Ordinarily we live
within the realm of the Law, even when fantasizing its abolition. Beyond
the law we see only its transgression or the lifting of a
prohibition.]{.underline} For the discourse of law and interdiction
determines the inverse discourse of transgression and liberation.
**[However, it is not the absence of the law that is opposed to the law,
but the Rule.]{.underline}** [The Rule]{.underline} plays on an immanent
sequence of arbitrary signs, while the Law is based on a transcendent
sequence of necessary signs. The one [concerns cycles, **the recurrence
of conventional procedures**, while the other is an instance based in an
irreversible continuity.]{.underline} The one involves obligations, the
other constraints and prohibitions. [Because the Law establishes a line,
it can and must be transgressed. By contrast, it makes no sense to
\"transgress\" a game\'s rules; within a cycle\'s recurrence, there is
no line one can jump (instead, one simply leaves the game).]{.underline}
Because the Law - whether that of the signifier, castration, or a social
interdiction - claims to be the discursive sign of a legal instance and
hidden truth, it results in repression and prohibitions, and thus the
division into a manifest and a latent discourse. Given that [the rule is
conventional]{.underline} and arbitrary, [and has no hidden
truth]{.underline}, it knows neither repression nor the distinction
between the manifest and the latent. It does not carry any meaning, it
does not lead anywhere; by contrast, the Law has a determinate finality.
The endless, reversible cycle of the Rule is opposed to the linear,
finalized. progression of the Law. **[Signs do not have the same status
in the one as in the other.]{.underline}** [The Law is part of the world
of representation]{.underline}, and is therefore subject to
interpretation or decipherment. It involves decrees or statements, and
is not indifferent to the subject. It is a text, and falls under the
influence of meaning and referentiality. [By contrast,]{.underline} the
Rule has no subject, and the form of its utterance is of little
consequence; [one does not decipher the rules,]{.underline} nor derive
pleasure from their comprehension - **[only their observance
matters,]{.underline}** and the resulting giddiness. This also
distinguishes the passion for the game\'s rituals and intensity from the
pleasure that attaches to obedience to the Law, or its transgression. In
order to understand the intensity of ritual forms, one must rid oneself
of the idea that all happiness derives from nature, and all pleasure
from the satisfaction of a desire. On the contrary, [games, the sphere
of play, reveal a passion for rules, a giddiness born of rules, and a
force that comes from ceremony, and not desire.]{.underline} Does the
delight one experiences in a game come from a dream-like situation,
where one moves free of reality, but which one can quit at any time? Not
at all. [Games, unlike dreams, are subject to rules, and one just
doesn\'t leave a game. Games create obligations like those found in
challenges. To leave a game is unsportsmanlike.]{.underline} And the
fact that one cannot refuse to play a game from within - a fact that
explains its enchantment and differentiates it from \"reality\" -
creates a symbolic pact which compels one to observe the rules without
reserve, and to pursue the game to the end, as one pursues a challenge
to the end. The order instituted by the game, being conventional, is
incommensurable with the necessary order of the real world: it is
neither ethical nor psychological, and its acceptance (the acceptance of
the rules) implies neither resignation nor constraint. As such, there is
no freedom in our moral and individual sense of that term, in games.
They are not to be equated with liberty. [Games do not obey the
dialectic of free will,]{.underline} that hypothetical dialectic of the
sphere of the real and the law. [To enter into a game is to enter a
system of ritual obligations.]{.underline} Its intensity derives from
its initiatory form - not from our liberty, as we would like to believe,
following an ideology that sees only a single, \"natural\" source of
happiness and pleasure. [The game\'s sole principle, though it is never
posed as universal, is that by choosing the rule one is delivered from
the law.]{.underline} Without a psychological or metaphysical
foundation, the rule has no grounding in belief. [One neither believes
nor disbelieves a rule - one observes it.]{.underline} The diffuse
sphere of belief, the need for credibility that encompasses the real, is
dissolved in the game. Hence their immorality : to proceed without
believing in it, to sanction a direct fascination with conventional
signs and groundless rules.

#### 2. Their attempt at transgression of the rules of debate is the ultimate conformity. Not only is this a very clear reason to vote negative on presumption, they reify the rules of debate, which turns the case. 

**Baudrillard 79.** Jean Baudrillard, Seduction, pg. 140-1

If games had a finality, the only true player would be the cheater. Now,
if a certain amount of prestige can be acquired by transgressing the
law, there is no prestige in cheating or transgressing a rule. In truth,
the cheater cannot transgress the rules since the game, not being a
system of interdictions, does not have lines one can cross. [One does
not \"trangress\" a rule, one fails to observe it . And non-observance
does not lead to a state of transgression ; it brings one back under the
jurisdiction of the law. This is the case with the cheater, who denies
or]{.underline}, even better, [profanes the game\'s ceremonial
conventions for economic]{.underline} reasons [(or]{.underline}
psychological reasons, if he cheats [simply for the pleasure of
winning), and thereby restores the laws of the real world. **By
introducing factors of an individual nature, he destroys the game\'s
\"duel\" enchantment .**]{.underline} If cheating was once punished by
death and is still condemned strongly, it is because, as a crime, it
resembles incest : cultural rules being broken to the sole profit of the
\"laws of nature.\" For [the cheater]{.underline}, there is no longer
anything at stake. He [confuses the stakes with surplus-value. But the
stakes are what enables one to play, and to turn them into the game\'s
purpose is to abuse one\'s position of trust. In a similar manner, **the
rules establish the very possibility of playing, the space within which
the sides confront each other.**]{.underline} To treat the rules as ends
(or as laws or truths) is to destroy both the game and its stakes. The
rules have no autonomy, that quality which, according to Marx,
characterizes commodities, both individually and in general, and is the
sacrosanct value of the economic domain. [The cheater too is autonomous:
he establishes a law, his own law, against the arbitrary rituals of the
rule - this is what disqualifies him.]{.underline} And he is free -this
explains his downfall . Moreover, he is rather dreary, because he no
longer exposes himself to the seduction of games, because he refuses the
vertigo of seduction. By way of hypothesis, one might postulate that
[personal advantage is only an alibi: in reality he cheats]{.underline}
in order to escape seduction ; he cheats [because he is afraid of being
seduced.]{.underline}

### Bogost/Fun

#### The impact outweighs---[adhering to limits]{.underline} isn't uncritical faith in them, rather, it cultivates an [ethos of play]{.underline} that breeds [respect]{.underline} for the world outside us and helps navigate existence ethically

**Bogost, 16**---holds a joint professorship in the School of
Literature, Media, and Communication and in Interactive Computing in the
College of Computing at the Georgia Institute of Technology, where he is

Studies (Ian, *Play Anything: The Pleasure of Limits, the Uses of
Boredom, and the Secret of Games* pg 115-120, kindle, dml)

[Play entails a paradox: it is an activity of **freedom** and
**pleasure** and **openness** and **possibility**, but it arises from
**limiting freedoms** rather than **expanding them**]{.underline}. The
boundaries of a playground, the contents contained within them. Their
structures. [Colloquial senses of game, play, and fun would hold that
these activities amount to **going outside the boundary** of normal
behavior, of **doing whatever you want**]{.underline}: "Don't play with
your food" or "stop fooling around." But in fact [**the opposite is
true**: interesting play experiences arise from **more constraints
rather than fewer**. Erecting barriers and boundaries **more clearly
delineates a system**]{.underline}. As Bernard Suits puts it, [play
requires its participants to accomplish something "using **only means
permitted by rules**]{.underline}, where the rules prohibit more
efficient in favor of less efficient means, [and where such rules are
accepted **just because they make possible such
activity**]{.underline}." 21

Normally, we address a play experience like my daughter's either as if
it were separate from the trip to the mall or as if it were perpetrated
in the service of the errand I had dragged her along on. On the one
hand, we could construe my daughter's activity as a distraction from the
"real" work of running errands and therefore existing outside the domain
of mall going, a play activity meant to release the boredom and unrest
of being somewhere unpleasant. On the other hand, we could see her
improvised play as a welcome and even a necessary distraction to help
facilitate the rest of the afternoon's errands. The first interpretation
assumes the work-play differential--- that the work of chores exists
nearby but orthogonal to the play that would divert a young child from
boredom. The second interpretation invokes the productive repurposing of
play as a means to pleasure or sanity, a resource to be put to use in
the interest of "real" effort.

The truth is stranger than either option. My daughter's game isn't a
distraction from errands, nor is it a mechanism to make errands
possible. Instead, it's an activity made out of errands and other things
too, like legs and ceramic tiles, in the same way golf is made out of
grass and sand and rubber and wood--- and leisure and wealth and zoning.
A playground.

While Huizinga's examples of the play element in culture are far
weightier than shopping, [the **profundity** of **war** and **politics**
and the like can hide the **ubiquity of play**. Play isn't only an
activity whose surprising uses can be found in **serious**,
**consequential activity**. It is also a **condition of the world**,
**everywhere we look**, available to us should we choose to see it---
and even if we don't.]{.underline}

PLAY IS THE WORK OF WORKING SOMETHING

An apparatus or experience fashioned by the boundaries of a magic circle
is not necessarily a "game" or a "toy." After all, a highway system or a
family budget has as many constraints as Monopoly or Super Mario Bros.
[Instead of calling everything a game, we should think of **everything
as playable**: capable of being **manipulated** in an **interesting**
and **appealing way** within the **confines of its constraints**. **All
media are playable** when we look at them in the right light. And that
light **need not entail** the **total reform** of our]{.underline}
educational [system]{.underline}, as Gray implies, [and it **need not
signal** the resolution of **insufferable institutional
autocracy**]{.underline}, as Sicart suggests. Rather, [play is the work
of **operating a subset of the world**, one separated from itself
via]{.underline} the **[circumscription]{.underline}** of the magic
circle.

The playground offers another perspective on the ironoiac madness of its
mirror image, the protective encasing symbolized by the plastic sofa
cover. By enclosing and encapsulating objects of experience, irony
protects us from them, but in so doing it removes them from possible
experience. Malls and school and food and everything else are
transformed into motifs rather than cohorts. The best we can do with
them is to emblazon them on T-shirts or tweets or Tumblrs, to use them
as catalogs of insufficiency, bestiaries of lost opportunities.

On first blush, ironic circumscription looks similar to tracing the
magic circle, to erecting a playground. A thing arises,
cheeseburger-flavored Pringles or espresso machines or a Frisbee, and it
preoccupies the attention of its observer. That thing is isolated, then
contained within the security of irony's seemingly impregnable blister
pack. Inevitably, irony's makeshift prison doesn't hold, and both the
object and its prison prove untrustworthy, demanding new enclosure. And
irony's gambit continues on ever larger scales, never offering succor
but only increasingly larger and more cumbersome enclosures.

But there's a difference between the ironic and the playful
circumscription. The former holds the object at arm's length--- beyond
arm's length, really, far enough to defuse it as a threat, and in so
doing shields the ironist from all possible encounter. Irony is the
playground circumscribed but then abandoned. Encounter leads to
potential disappointment or betrayal. Better to treat everything as a
threat, to trust nothing, to experience nothing save involvement with
distrust itself. Confinement, regulation, and control characterize
ironic circumscription. And like all good prisons, the ironoiac's object
of mistrust is caged, isolated from its warden so to hold its savagery
at bay. Who knows what potato chips and roadways and lawns might do if
unleashed?

By contrast, [the playground includes the observer as a member. It
fashions the would-be ironist into a **participant**]{.underline}---
whether as operator or observer--- [but still maintains the tenuousness
of that involvement]{.underline}. Like a chalk line on pavement, [the
playground knows that it is **arbitrary** and **temporary**,
**flexible** and **negotiable**. Play takes **ironic detachment** and
transforms it into the conditions that **bring about the experience it
makes possible**. Play **refuses to presume** that the golf course
or]{.underline} the [shopping center is **reasonable** or **even
desirable**, a **legitimate** and **certain source** of basic operation,
let alone success or meaning or joy. Instead, it **merely asks** what
**might be possible** when things]{.underline} like fairways and malls
[are **encountered** by human agents.]{.underline}

[The playful stance is]{.underline} the opposite of the ironic one: [an
embrace of the thing in question rather than a rejection of
it]{.underline}. But not because play is more earnest or sincere, and
not because it represents the free and liberated will of the player,
whose volition elects the play experience instead of some other, less
desirable labor or chore. For the ironoiac, the threat of an object's
insufficiency produces paralysis. But [for the player, this
insufficiency is **assumed from the start**, as a **necessary
condition** of play. Play is **impossible without restriction**--- not
doing what you want, but **determining what is possible to do** given
the meager resources provided]{.underline}.

[Play and the resulting effect we call fun are **not loose human
actions** and **emotions**. They are **created** in conjunction with
external objects. To experience fun, we must **shift our
reference**]{.underline} from the joy or enjoyment we have come to
expect from play, [and instead understand play as a **condition of
objects** and **situations**. Things are at play more so than we play
with them. And when we encounter things that are subject to play,we
**need not subsume them** into]{.underline} the domain of toys or games
or playthings or other [mere amusements, but we might instead simply
allow them to **be exactly what they are**]{.underline}. Indeed,
[perhaps viewing them as what they are is the **only way** we can truly
allow objects, situations, events, people, communities, and anything
else to **produce pleasure**. **Not** by **subsuming** or **capturing
them**, and not by deluding ourselves into believing that we are
exerting our own control, creativity, and disruption over them. But
rather by addressing each thing **for what it is**, while all the while
acknowledging that anything is not entirely ours to address in the first
place. If fun is an **admiration** for the **absurd arbitrariness of
things**, play is the **process** by which we **arrive at that
respect**. Play is an **activity**, but even more so it's a **material
property of all objects**]{.underline}--- from guitars to steering
columns to malls to lawns to language to, well, games--- [and fun is a
**sensual quality** that emanates from them when we **touch these things
in the right way**. Discovering, choosing, managing, and living with
what's inside a particular playground--- that's where **fun**, and where
**meaning**, **resides**.]{.underline}

#### Fun is an impact! It's not just some vacuous sense of enjoyment, it's an ethos of [willfully enjoying]{.underline} a game shaped by arbitrary limits---this cultivates a joyous approach to the world that lets value to life flourish, but not one they can access through transgressing the rules

An old aphorism about golf calls the game "a good walk spoiled." That
funny quip underscores a fundamental feature of games: [games **make no
sense**, and yet we take them seriously **precisely because they make no
sense**]{.underline}. The philosopher Bernard Suits calls that
seriousness "a voluntary attempt to overcome unnecessary obstacles." 15
Golf is a desirable experience because it distorts space and time in
order to make the player's experience of a landscape more deliberate.
[We **seek out this deliberateness** when we play.]{.underline}

[Fun is **not a feeling**]{.underline}, it turns out. And [it's
certainly not the feeling of enjoying ourselves by **doing exactly what
we want**, by **making something easy** or by rewarding ourselves with
points]{.underline}, as if life is some latent version of Space Invaders
that turns chores into chortles. Instead, [fun is a name for
**deliberately manipulating** a familiar situation in a new way. We can
**only have fun** once we have **accepted the truth** of a situation and
**treated it for what it is**. When we've agreed to **suspend our
disbelief** in its preposterousness]{.underline}. Golf isn't a good walk
spoiled, but a way to transform landscapes into a centuries-long hobby.

And like golf, the things we tend to find the most "fun" are not easy
and sweet like the Bankses' cleanup routine. Manual transmissions and
knitting are fun because they make driving and fashion hard rather than
easy. They expose the materials of vehicles and fabrics, and they do not
apologize for doing so. They make playgrounds in which gear ratios and
yarn loops become materials like ceramic floor tiles or zoysiagrass or
espresso. [Terror is at work in real fun, the terror of **facing the
world as it really is**, rather than covering it up with
sugar.]{.underline}

The process of fun turns out to be work. But not work like you find in
the workplace. Rather, work like you find when working something:
working wood, or working the muscles, or working the dance floor. In
each of these cases, [the extraction of pleasure or enjoyment we derive
does not constitute the fun of the act, but the experience of
oscillating between the potential and actual properties of a set
of]{.underline} people, [things]{.underline}, events, and ideas [outside
of us.]{.underline} In Marshall McLuhan's terms, fun is the process of
flipping figure and ground, taking something unseen and forcing it to
become visible again or anew and taking something obvious and hiding it
away temporarily. In Martin Heidegger's terms, [fun is taking something
ready-to-hand]{.underline} (in use, but unseen) [and reframing it as
present-at-hand]{.underline} (outside implementation, with potential).
[And then, after **circumscribing a playground** around it]{.underline}
to set its materials in relief, [**imagining** and **deploying new
actions** on and with that thing]{.underline}.

This explanation may sound somewhat abstract and unnecessarily
philosophical, but actually, [it's precisely what people do when they
partake in the activities they think to call fun.]{.underline}

Golf isn't a good walk spoiled, but an approach to encountering a
designed and tended environment. A playground made of playgrounds.
First, a natural environment is reformed into a manicured one, with
fairways, rough, sand-and-water traps, rocks, curves and switchbacks,
trees, and so forth. In this respect, the golf course is similar to the
English garden, insofar as both create an invitation to pastoral
traversal. The garden stops there, and that fact is its delight: the
opportunity arises to watch, to think, to listen, to stroll, or to
attend to nothing whatsoever.

But at the golf course, traversal is only the beginning. The ball and
the clubs and the rules of the game shift the ground of the course---
the actual grounds, in this case--- into figure. They recast the
fairways and roughs and greens as possible vantage points or obstacles
for moving the ball toward the hole. New playgrounds get circumscribed
as others fall away, and then spring up again anew. The golfer's own
strength, experience, adeptness, and tactical wherewithal perform
further oscillations of figure and ground, use and potential. So do the
other material conditions that might intersect with the game: the
weather, such as the effects of heat on the golfer's stamina or the
effects of a prior rain on the ball's ability to rebound from a bounce
on the fairway; the time of day and week, and its impact on the crowds
on the greens; the familiarity of a local course, or the novelty of a
new one; the languor or pressure of a particular foursome, filled with
friends or family or strangers or business prospects. Instead of a good
walk spoiled, golf is a walk refactored, turned in on itself like a
helix, again and again.

[The gyres and volutions of fun activities help explain another
counterintuitive property of the phenomenon. Fun **isn't a distraction**
or an **escape** from the world, but an **ever deeper** and **more
committed engagement** with it. The golfer who **fails to engage** with
the various figures of the course and its related
materials]{.underline}, whether through incompetence or refusal, [is
**likely** to have **far less fun** than the player who has, through
**practice** and **attention**, found reason to **address those
conditions** as a **part of the play experience**]{.underline}.

Proponents of Csikszentmihalyian flow would add a codicil here: that the
novice or the amateur's fun only arises from goals and capacities
carefully balanced between anxiety and boredom. And here, the role of
flow may indeed have a place: difficult courses like Pebble Beach or
Torrey Pines push even competent golfers to the edge of useful action.
Without the capacity to engage the materials of golf as materials, to
work them like one works wood, the resulting experience would be
inferior.

But these local minima of fun rely too heavily on human goals and
accomplishments, and not enough on the unassailable nature of reality.
Flow may help us optimize experience, but viscosity is needed to
understand where such optimizations might take place. A supposedly
inferior experience, like the novice golfer at Pebble Beach, is only
terrible if we are unwilling to engage with boredom or anxiety in the
first place, if we are so selfish as to see our performance as central
to the encounter with a sublime place like Pebble Beach.

[Fun is not only the delight in success, but also the **panic of
uncertainty**, the **agony of failure**]{.underline}. It arises when
figure and ground swap places and surprise us. [The familiar **turns
strange**; we no longer grasp it fully. There, facing the world's stark
truth, we either **throw up our hands** in disgust or dread--- or we
**persist** and **discover something new**]{.underline}.

THIS PROCESS OF discovery that we have heretofore nicknamed fun is a
good candidate for the physical therapy we require to overcome ironoia.
Irony, remember, arises when we fail to trust things as they are, but
instead hold them at arm's length for fear they will turn on us or
otherwise disappoint. But in the symptom we also discovered a possible
cure: treating the sensation of ironoia as a signal that something is
worthy of further attention. As a sign that we've already found or
constructed a playground--- all we need to do is accept the invitation
to make use of it.

The desire to encapsulate something in the safety of a new covering or
to reject it as insufficient signals an opportunity to renew one's
commitment toward it. My flight-mate's discomfort at the air marshal
(the ironic not-fun "super fun") or the novice golfer's anxiety when
facing the unfamiliar rituals of a foursome--- these moments of distrust
offer evidence that something deeper and weirder is present than each
agent had previously considered possible.

And just as Wallace argued that satisfaction and joy and contribution
might come from work--- even boring work--- as much as from
entertainment, so the feelings that we might extract from a particular
playground are far more numerous and more complex than the simple, easy
pleasure we have mistakenly named "fun." Anxiety, uncertainty, sorrow,
and even misery and horror prove compatible with fun, once we've allowed
ourselves to think of fun as treating something for what it is rather
than as a nickname for diversion or satisfaction.

A job is made fun not by turning it into a game, but by deeply and
deliberately pursuing it as a job. Jobs are fun when their work is
meaningful, when their activities matter, and when the act of conducting
them can be done over and over again with increased commitment. Fun
can't be added to something, like sugar to coffee or like songs to
chores.

In their book All Things Shining, the philosophers Hubert Dreyfus and
Sean Dorrance Kelly talk about this same issue in the context of
Wallace's depression and eventual suicide: in a secular age, meaning has
to come from within, created from nothing. 16 Dreyfus and Kelly argue
that this demand to make something wholly from nothing, by sheer force
of will, is the weight that undid Wallace--- and that the same demand is
eating away slowly at all the rest of us, too. Wallace's desperate
attempt to make fun equal delight on the cruise he took for Harper's or
to see literary and televisual irony as a means to uncovering hypocrisy
are the desperate grasps of the secular ironoiac who knows that
dissatisfaction is only your fault, given the infinity of options
available instead of ocean cruises and contemporary fiction and golf and
air travel and all the rest.

But near the end of Pale King Wallace puts his finger on an alternative:
boredom. [Working through boredom in order to **find deeper structure**
can form the **boundary** and **contents** for a playground. "It is the
**key to modern life**]{.underline}," he writes, "[If you are **immune
to boredom**, there is **literally nothing you cannot
accomplish**]{.underline}." 17 [Embracing boredom doesn't really mean
enjoying being bored. Rather, if we can **bore through the boredom**
when paying attention to ordinary, mundane things]{.underline} (tax
returns and televised golf are Wallace's examples), [then something
magical happens underneath. Ride that out]{.underline}, writes Wallace,
"[and it's like **stepping from black and white into color**. Like
**water after days in the desert**. **Constant bliss in every atom**."
Achieving this bliss requires **giving yourself over to the structure**
of a situation rather than **asking it to return its spoils to
you**]{.underline}.

This tactic is the cure for ironoia, too: [you accept that meaning **can
come from outside of you** rather than from within. Perhaps, even, that
it must]{.underline}.

THE SUSPENSION OF FOLLY

Along with Mary Poppins, we assume that [finding the fun starts with us
rather than the thing itself]{.underline}. That we must bring something
to the table that makes intolerable things tolerable, like a song covers
chores or like chocolate covers broccoli. But as Suits suggests, [a game
is something **good enough on its own**, something for which
on-its-ownness is **precisely the point**. Suits calls this willingness
to accept the **arbitrariness of a game** the "**lusory
attitude**]{.underline}." Golf would be worse than "a good walk ruined"
were it a Broadway song and dance number about dropping balls in holes,
Mary Poppins style.

[To reject these systems as insufficient is certainly
possible]{.underline}--- the ironoiac does so all the time, after all.
[To doubt that anything positive, credible, or long-lasting could arise
from]{.underline} something like [the]{.underline} thankless, [arbitrary
world]{.underline}, or else to capture its surface effects and to see
them as mere signs, exchangeable for one another via new proverbial
blister packs of ironic appropriation. Or else to assume that you
yourself are unprepared for them, not good enough for Pebble Beach--- or
anything else. It turns out we can hold ourselves at an ironic distance,
too. But [to issue such rejections just because the materials in our
midst are annoying or unsatisfactory is to **miss the point**: they are
**meant** to be **annoying** and **unsatisfactory**. Meaningful things
contain something abhorrent]{.underline}, something revolting [even
though sublime. And every now and then, when you stare down their
abhorrence, **they will reward you**.]{.underline}

### XT---Fun

#### We straight turn the aff and solve it better---playing within [limits]{.underline} in an isolated game space like debate reveal that play is a [condition of the world]{.underline} in that all objects we encounter can be approached in new, playful and experimental ways. Affirming the arbitrariness of limits by [adhering]{.underline} to the [baseline constraint]{.underline} of being topical is [key]{.underline} to this---it's the only method you as a judge can choose that approaches the [object]{.underline} of the game on its [own terms]{.underline} by affirming limits have value even if we'd prefer total self-expression---that's a [better way]{.underline} of cultivating a posthuman ethos than demanding [affective solidarity]{.underline} via the ballot

Even in philosophy [humans have sat at the center of being, ethics, and
aesthetics since the Enlightenment]{.underline}, when Immanuel Kant
imagined a Copernican Revolution in philosophy to mirror the one in
cosmology. It was from this common origin in Enlightenment rationalism
that human culture spread in the different directions Watts judged
insufficient. Science broke down the biological, physical, and
cosmological world into smaller and smaller bits in order to understand
its truth, which would then be deployed to service the betterment of
humankind. Religion redoubled its investment in God via a new dedication
to reason, both through hybrids like God-as-watchmaker deism, and via
the religious revivalism that rose up against the new era of reason. In
both cases, the reign of mankind on Earth remained absolute, its
terrestrial matter at our absolute disposal thanks to the pending
eternity we would find in heaven. For its part, philosophy concluded
that reason could not even explain external objects but only experience
itself--- this was Kant's position, one that still hasn't outworn its
influence in epistemology and metaphysics. And it was the position in
more populist cultural debates, too, where all reality gets strained
through the sieve of culture, religion, science, politics. Everything
whatsoever becomes but the expression of human will or ideology.

The sociologist Bruno [Latour wraps all of it]{.underline}--- religion,
science, philosophy, and more--- [into]{.underline} one historical era:
**[modernity]{.underline}**. Starting in the Renaissance, human cultures
began dividing and "purifying" the domains of nature and culture from
one another. 17 But [this modern idea is really a misconception;
instead, things are **hybrids** of **nature** and **culture**,
**\[hu\]mankind** and **world**, **society** and **individualism**. We
are all **bound up** with so many other actors]{.underline}, as Latour
calls them: roadways and chlorofluorocarbons, mature woods and IKEA
boxes, global banking networks and the wayward birds that clog jet
turbines.

Worse, the modern misconception is a positive feedback loop, a Chinese
finger trap in which we only become more imbricated the more we try to
escape it. Climate change is a hybrid created by the fusion of human
progress with planetary fragility, a collaboration underwritten by
myriad political, industrial, and economic circumstances. But when we
insist on the inevitable defeat of nature by science, we end up with
even more hybrids, and even more hybridized ones: robotic car services
that promise to end the reign of the passenger automobile, or the dream
of uploading ourselves to powerful computers that will simulate human
consciousness. Latour advocates for a "parliament of things" that
accepts hybridization and ends the false dream of purification. 18 Among
those who have carried Latour's torch is the philosopher Graham Harman,
whose revision of the Heideggerian idea of readiness-to-hand and
presence-at-hand applies to the relationships between objects of all
sorts we visited earlier. It's not only that people find hammers to be
ready-to-hand when in use and present-at-hand when broken; it's also
that hammers and nails, hammers and hooks, hammers and rust have the
same relationship.

That concept leads us back to Alan Watts. When we feel insecurity, we
are really feeling the wish for our own permanence. "We do not actually
understand that there is no security," writes Watts, "until we realize
that this 'I' does not exist." 19 It's a decidedly Buddhist statement
whose new age bell ringing might make your eyes roll, but Watts is
really saying the same thing as Latour and Harman: we humans are not
separate from the world, but a part of it, just another thing among all
the other things, from ketchups to ketch boats, RAV4s to ravines.

And as Burkeman also divines, mistaking the world for our world is
another name for ironoia. Thinking of ourselves as centered bodies
drawing meaning and contentment toward ourselves like gravity to
planetary bodies, bodies that deserve something from everything. But our
refusal to relinquish faith in the "I" that does not exist, says
Burkeman,

. . . explains in the most complete sense why our efforts to find
happiness are so frequently sabotaged by 'ironic' effects, delivering
the exact opposite of what we set out to gain. All positive thinking,
all goal-setting and visualizing and looking on the bright side, all
trying to make things go our way, as opposed to some other way, is
rooted in an assumption about the separateness of "us" and those
"things." But on closer inspection this assumption collapses. 20

[**Embracing the play made possible by limitations** turns happiness
inside out. When you circumscribe]{.underline} a magic circle around
[something, you **inaugurate a different attitude** from the modernist,
from the self-help happiness seeker]{.underline}, from the ironoiac.
[**Instead** of **asking for an affective return** on investment
transferrable to **specific psychological outcomes**, you **submit
yourself** to the **same system** as the elements you have drawn into
your magic circle. You **become a thing** like them,
imbricated]{.underline}, bound up, twisting, dancing, trying to make the
Rube Goldberg machine that is you-and-them work, [turning the crank
**not** because it **does something useful**, but **just to see what it
does**.]{.underline}

[PLAY INVITES US to draw an **overdue conclusion**: that the potential
meaning and value of things]{.underline}--- anything: relationships, the
natural world, packaged goods--- [is **in them rather than in us**. Play
is **not** a kind of **self-expression**, nor a **pursuit of freedom**.
It is a **kind of creation**]{.underline}, a kind of craftsmanship,
even. [By adopting]{.underline}, inventing, constructing, and
reconfiguring [the **material** and **conceptual limits** around us, we
can fashion novelty from **anything at all**]{.underline}. Although they
refer to poiesis--- the making that grounds poetry--- instead of play,
the philosophers Bert Dreyfus and Sean Kelly come to a similar
conclusion about finding meaning in a secular age: "[The
task]{.underline} of the craftsman [is **not** to
**generate**]{.underline} the [**meaning**, but rather to
**cultivate**]{.underline} in himself [the **skill** for **discerning
the meanings that are already there**]{.underline}."

### Caillois/Play

#### Their nihilistic depictions of the political present and its commitment to a ressentiment based politics can be true about the world, academia, or their own lives in the abstract -- debate is DIFFERENT because it is a game -- the space of play must remain unique as it carves out moments of play and joy despite the depleted condition of modern life and work. Play is different than work BECAUSE adherents agree to minimal consensus based work -- this is a UNIQUE link turn to the aff value claims. 

**Caillois 61.** Roger Caillois, famous French intellectual and
sociologist, Bataille's friend, Man, Play and Games, trans. Barash,
University of Illinois Press, 1961, 54

In effect, [play is]{.underline} essentially a separate occupation,
carefully isolated from the rest of life, and generally is [engaged in
with precise limits of time and place]{.underline}. There is place for
play: as needs dictate, the space for hopscotch, the board for checkers
or chess, the stadium, the racetrack, the list, the ring, the stage, the
arena, etc. Nothing that takes place outside this ideal frontier is
relevant. **[To leave the enclosure by mistake, accident, or necessity,
to send the ball out of bounds, may disqualify or entail a
penalty.]{.underline}**

**[The game must be taken back within the agreed
boundaries]{.underline}**. The same is true for time: the game starts
and ends at a given signal. Its duration is often fixed in advance. It
is improper to abandon or interrupt the game without a major reason (in
children's games, crying "I give up," for example). If there is occasion
to do so, the game is prolonged, by agreement between the contestants or
by decision of an umpire. In every case, [the game's domain is therefore
a restricted, closed, protected universe: **a pure space.**]{.underline}

[The confused and intricate laws of ordinary life are
replaced]{.underline}, in this fixed space and for this given time,
**[by precise, arbitrary, unexceptionable rules that must be accepted as
such and that govern the correct playing of the game]{.underline}**.
**[If the cheat violates the rules, he at least pretends to respect
them]{.underline}**. [He does not discuss them: he takes advantage of
the other players' loyalty to the rules]{.underline}. From this point of
view, [one must agree with the writers who have stressed the fact that
the cheat's dishonesty does not destroy the game]{.underline}. **[The
game is ruined by the nihilist who denounces the rules as absurd and
conventional, who refuses to play because the game is
meaningless]{.underline}**. [His arguments are
**irrefutable**]{.underline}. The game has no other but an intrinsic
meaning. **[That is why its rules are imperative and absolute, beyond
discussion]{.underline}**. [There is no reason for their being as they
are, rather than otherwise. Whoever does not accept them as such must
deem them manifest folly.]{.underline}

One plays only if and when one wishes to. In this sense, [play is free
activity]{.underline}. [It is also uncertain activity]{.underline}.
Doubt must remain until the end, and hinges upon the denouement. In a
card game, when the outcome is no longer in doubt, play stops and the
players lay down their hands. In a lottery or in roulette, money is
placed on a number which may or may not win. In a sports contest, the
powers of the contestants must be equated, so that each may have a
chance until the end. [Every game of skill, by definition, involves the
risk for the player of missing his stroke, and the threat of defeat,
without which the game would no longer be pleasing. In fact, the game is
no longer pleasing to one who, because he is too well trained or
skillful, wins effortlessly and infallibly.]{.underline}

#### Second, this a unique case turn -- the corruption of the principle of play fuels endless global warfare thru the justified destruction of all limits. 

**Caillois 61.** Roger Caillois, famous French intellectual and
sociologist, Bataille's friend, Man, Play and Games, trans. Barash,
University of Illinois Press, 1961, 54

[What we set out to analyze was **the corruption of the principles of
play**, or preferably, their free expansion without check or
convention]{.underline}. It was shown that such corruption is produced
in identical ways. [It entails consequences which seem to be
inordinately serious]{.underline}. **[Madness or intoxication may be
sanctions that are disproportionate to the simple overflow of one of the
play instincts out of the domain in which it can spread without
irreparable harm]{.underline}**. In contrast, the superstitions
engendered by deviation from alea seem benign. Even more, **[when the
spirit of competition freed from rules of equilibrium and loyalty is
added to unchecked ambition, it seems to be profitable for the daring
one who is abandoned to it]{.underline}**. Moreover, [the temptation to
guide one's behavior by resort to remote powers and magic symbols in
automatically applying a system of imaginary correspondences does not
aid man to exploit his basic abilities more efficiently]{.underline}.
**[He becomes fatalistic]{.underline}**. He becomes incapable of deep
appreciation of relationships between phenomena. **[Perseverance and
trying to succeed despite unfavorable circumstances are
discouraged.]{.underline}**

**[Transposed to reality, the only goal of agon is
success]{.underline}**. The rules of courteous rivalry are forgotten and
scorned. [They seem merely irksome and hypocritical
conventions]{.underline}. **[Implacable competition becomes the
rule]{.underline}**. **[Winning even justifies foul
blows]{.underline}**. **[If the individual remains inhibited by fear of
the law or public opinion, it nonetheless seems permissible, if not
meritorious, for nations to wage unlimited ruthless
warfare.]{.underline}**

**[Various restrictions on violence fall into disuse]{.underline}**.
Operations are no longer limited to frontier provinces, strongholds, and
military objectives. **[They are no longer conducted according to a
strategy that once made war itself resemble a game]{.underline}**. War
is far removed from the tournament or duel, i.e. from regulated combat
in an enclosure, and now finds its fulfillment in massive destruction
and the massacre of entire populations.

[**Any corruption of the principles of play** means the abandonment of
those precarious and doubtful conventions that it is always permissible,
if not profitable, to deny, but the arduous adoption of which is a
milestone in the development of civilization]{.underline}. If the
principles of play in effect correspond to powerful instincts
(competition, chance, simulation, vertigo), [it is readily understood
that they can be positively and creatively gratified only under ideal
and circumscribed conditions, which in every case prevail in the rules
of play]{.underline}. **[Left to themselves, destructive and frantic as
are all instincts, these basic impulses can hardly lead to any but
disastrous consequences]{.underline}**. **[Games discipline instincts
and institutionalize them]{.underline}**. [For the time that they afford
formal and limited satisfaction, **they educate, enrich, and immunize
the mind against their virulence**]{.underline}. At the same time,
**[they are made fit to contribute usefully to the enrichment and the
establishment of various patterns of culture.]{.underline}**

### Negarestani/Engineering

#### Debate should be a site of [engineering]{.underline} in which we adhere by [shared norms of communication]{.underline} to experiment with [concrete political visions]{.underline}---you should [reject]{.underline} explanations of metaphysical totalities that can't account for the reverberating effects of individual experiments. Communication and rationality are inevitable---trying to subvert them fizzles out [at best]{.underline} and is [proto-fascist bad faith at worst]{.underline}---only [proactively engineering political visions]{.underline} within the constraints of the world we live in can prevent [extinction]{.underline}.

**Gironi and Negarestani, 18**---IRC Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the
School of Philosophy, University College Dublin AND Iranian philosopher
(Fabio and Reza, "ENGINEERING THE WORLD, CRAFTING THE MIND,"
<https://www.neroeditions.com/docs/reza-negarestani-engineering-the-world-crafting-the-mind/>,
dml)

[As long as]{.underline}, [we are not willing to recognize
**education**]{.underline} in the aforementioned sense [as the
**scaffolding upon which any political movement should be built** we are
**doomed to live in the status quo**]{.underline}. Short of an
unconditional prioritization of education, [**all we ever can hope for
are quick fixes** accompanied with phases of socio-political
overexcitement which **soon fizzle out**, leading us to a position which
was **worse than before**. Politics without education as its premise
**can never maintain its long-term traction**. It effectively **exempts
itself** from the **concerns of the next generations**]{.underline}. But
what is a politics without the potential concerns for next
generations---whoever or whatever they might be---if not an extension of
our egotism and selfishness here and now? While I consider myself a
leftist, I nevertheless think that my frustration with the left is
precisely the issue of education. Look at something like left
accelerationism: where is the acknowledgment of education or
developmental psychology i.e. nurturing as the unconditional factor?
[Where is your **logistical-financial** and **organizational
plan**]{.underline} for education? [If you **lack these** then no matter
**how much you insist** on egalitarian ends, you are **not going to
attain them**]{.underline}. However, being the hopeless leftist that I
am, I believe that left, has "in principle" more chance to concretely
address the issue of education than the right.

[I believe in]{.underline} something like [a **universalist
paradigm**]{.underline} of education or equality of minds. Here, the
appellation [universal **does not mean a pre-conceived global paradigm**
that can be **indiscriminately imposed** upon everyone. Education is
**all about context sensitivity**, fulfilling local
exigencies]{.underline}. But at the same time, I think [there are **deep
cognitive frameworks** which are **common to us all** and can be
**augmented** under a universal or global framework]{.underline}. I
think Kant was onto something important. His hierarchies of faculties as
elaborated under the rubric of transcendental psychology---i.e. the
necessary conditions for the possibility for having a mind---are not
merely a trivial or arbitrary list of faculties. They were as much a
necessary list of abilities as they were an example of an
epistemological inquiry into the specific modes of cognition required
for critical and objective thinking. For example, what he calls
sensibility, reproductive and productive imagination, understanding and
reason are actually necessary "classes" or "types" for being a minded
subject. If we believe in the equality of all minds then we ought to
also believe in complex recipes that can universally augment such
necessary classes, regardless of whether we belong to different
geographic locations, ethnicities, or even species.

Fabio Gironi: The delicate question of universalism was indeed my next
target. Those who grew up intellectually in the leftist academic
environment of the late twentieth century were taught, more or less
explicitly, that "universalism" is something of a taboo term. Indeed,
you just mentioned [the left's penchant for **intersubjectivity without
objectivity**]{.underline}---that is to say for [a celebration of
**irreducible particularities**, **local practices**, **identities** and
so on]{.underline}---which [**renounces global** and **universalist
ambitions**]{.underline}. Now, I think that [this **anti-totalizing
intellectual season**]{.underline} (a former teacher of mine once told
me how, sometime in the mid-80s, he witnessed a heckler shout "you
totalizing bastard!" during a public talk by Fredric Jameson---this
peculiar "insult" always makes me chuckle) was a necessary step,
contextually justified by a certain post-World War II socio-political
environment. However, it [has]{.underline} now [become **unreflective
doxa**, leading to a **counterproductive knee-jerk reaction** against a
**whole constellation** of ideas and concepts]{.underline}---many of
which you are explicitly committed to. Universalism is one of those and
(neo)rationalism is another, and the two are obviously related.

[This]{.underline} stance of yours [has]{.underline} occasionally
[led]{.underline} you [to a **collision course**]{.underline} with,
let's say, more "orthodox" leftists, [since **all too often**
universalism is **equated with authoritarianism**, while neo-rationalism
is **confused with dogmatism** and **blinkered logicism** (just like
**any talk of "norms"** is taken to be an **implicit call for
normalization**---**may Foucault save us all!**]{.underline}). As if
"rationalism" in general was always necessarily guided by an ambition of
comprehensive and total control: a reactionary intellectual orientation
for the preservation of good societal order, the adversary of the
philosophical and political projects prioritizing the bottom-up
affective development of vectors of individual freedom. What are the
methods and goals of the universalist rationalism?

Reza Negarestani: [Calling yourself a rationalist universalist
is]{.underline} even worse, it is doubly **[taboo]{.underline}**. [It is
akin to identifying yourself as an **agent of some totalitarian
nightmare straight out a postmodern parody** where you actually **take
pride** in having a poor sense of humour, being cretinous and
shamelessly insensitive]{.underline}. The corresponding image would be
not O'Brien from 1984 but a villain from a Donald Barthelme's story who
just wants to liquidate people using absurdist methods for the sheer
experimental joy of it. So, the question, as you brought it up, is: [how
did we come to have such a cultural perception about reason or
universalism?]{.underline} Can we ever step outside of this culture? If
the answer is positive, what can we accomplish by doing so? And
correspondingly, [if we continue to remain in this culture what do we
**lose** or **risk**? The answer]{.underline} to these questions is
obviously not straightforward. It [requires **not just**]{.underline} a
historical **[analysis of]{.underline}** economic and social
[**conditions using adequately objective diagnostic tools**, but also a
**system of thought for imagining** and **concretely building an
alternative world**, one that]{.underline} does not begin with the year
zero but [is **built in continuity with the existing one** which we
currently inhabit. Both]{.underline}, of course, [require the
**adoption**, **refinement** and **development** of our concepts of
reason and universality as the first step]{.underline}.

As you mentioned, given the historical contamination of these concepts,
there is an immense work to be done not just to gain the trust of people
but also to repair or discard their negative aspects in theory and
practice. Let me begin with universalism. I see universalism as a
necessary, concrete and global labour of collectivization. It is very
much in tandem with the idea of concrete self-consciousness or
collective self-determination as a matter of practical achievement built
simultaneously on inter-subjectivity and objectivity, particularities
and universalities which are a priori. [Even in our particularities and
differences, we **always begin with abstract** or **formal
universalities**, things like being concept-users, private thoughts
which are **modelled on a public language**]{.underline}, deep cognitive
faculties and categories which even in their specificity have universal
logical structures. So, in a sense, we already live in a universalist
state, albeit an abstract one. [We are experiencing, thinking and acting
individuals to the extent that we are **socially constituted through**
and **through**]{.underline}. Kant and Hegel---despite their
shortcomings in appreciating the true consequences of the sociality of
mind---make this point quite clear: [we **could not have
experience**---through which it is possible to **develop a conception of
ourselves** in the world---in the first place, if we **did not have some
shared repertoire of universal** and **necessary
conditions**]{.underline}. Speaking of experience as something
originally particular or individual is hardly anything more than a
symptom of a purely solipsistically perspectival view that is
irreconcilable with the reality represented by cognitive science, logic,
computation, mathematics, and even evolutionary biology.

However, there is nothing in this abstract universality that safeguards
it from pathologies of individuation and particularism precisely because
the real social conditions in which it is embedded can in fact be
pathological as it is the case. So, [universalism in its genuine form is
the **concrete** and **critical expression of universalities** at the
level of **real social conditions**. And its aim is the **maximization
of the capacities to think** and **act**, to **entertain** and
**actualize possibilities beyond the confines of the existing world** in
which we live]{.underline}---a world that purports to be a completed
totality. [To achieve this aim, to **build a new world** in which the
possibility of disenthralled thinking and action coincides with
possibilities of a world in which the individual and social problems and
pathologies are resolved]{.underline}, however, [is **impossible without
first responding systematically** and **rationally** to the constrains
of the world in which we already live.]{.underline} In this sense, I
would say [universalism is at its core concerned with **world-building**
or more precisely **world-engineering** to the extent that our premise,
resource and space of labour is **always this world** and **not some
imaginary world**]{.underline} or an afterlife heaven. [The possible
world **cannot be one that is sealed off from this world**, a universe
or a commune that exists parallel to our world. The former is **merely a
fantasy**, the latter is not only **phantasmic** but also **parasitic**
upon the pathologies the real world without even realizing
it]{.underline}.

To sum up, the path to concrete universalism always begins from
particularities of our experience of the world which are constituted by
abstract universalities. So, in a sense, the trajectory of universalism
should always begin from local conditions of thinking and action, rather
than a purported universal condition under which we can all be
integrated and unified. But this trajectory does not end with the local,
it must pass through stages and encompass the global conditions of
thinking and action. [Remaining in the ambit the local is **actually
what suffers** from a **delusive idealism**, not
universalism]{.underline}. Why? Because [this localism abides by **the
myth of a closed system** in which jobs can get done **effectively** and
**perfectly**. But a closed system is **simply an idealized state**, to
**mistake an idealized model with the messy reality** is a hallmark of
credulity]{.underline}. Not to mention, the microlocalist setup is
destined to be afflicted with what I call theoretical-practical Habsburg
syndrome, i.e., [you end up breeding thoughts and actions which are
**increasingly less optimal** to address your initial ambitions and
problems]{.underline}. In other words, [the logarithmic curve of
thinking and acting which were supposed to optimally solve your local
problems **suddenly drops** after a sufficient time, precisely because
you run out of computational or cognitive resources, the majority of
them you have **chosen to call enemies**. Without interaction with the
environment, your system becomes **ever more fragile** and soon a
**premature death knocks at your door**]{.underline}.

Fabio Gironi: So [what are the main obstacles and resistances posed to
universalism by its detractors, and how can they be
countered]{.underline}?

Reza Negarestani: With regard to the demand to resurrect rationalist
universalism---or more broadly the rationalist reconstruction of the
world to appropriate the Vienna Circle as opposed to the Frankfurt
School---[there are]{.underline} at least three [major
objections]{.underline}:

\(1\) [Universalism will **flatten differences** and is ultimately,
another form of **imposed global order** whose parameters are set in
advance]{.underline}. In response to this objection, I would say that
yes [this was the case with **old traditions of universalism** coming
from European thinkers]{.underline} such as Kant. [But concrete
universalism **cannot be imagined** without the non-trivial or synthetic
integration of local conditions. A paradigm of universalism that does
not respond to **local exigencies** in their own context is **only a
disguised imperialism**]{.underline}.

\(2\) [The second objection]{.underline} might come from a communitarian
perspective: surely we can build a world sealed off from the
pathological systems that plague this planet. I counter this claim by
saying that this supposed world [is built on two
presuppositions]{.underline}: (a) [You are implicitly endorsing a
**metaphysical totality** in which everything that is going on in this
world of ours has been **assimilated by a pathological
system**]{.underline} (e.g., Capitalism) [but this totality is **only an
illusion** which you have **chosen to take for reality**]{.underline};
(b) [your commune in fact **parasitizes on the affordances** provided by
our world. The alleged purity of your thoughts and actions is **actually
made possible** by the **pathologies from which you think you have
diverged**. Your commune is **not a solution** but **only another
anonymous contribution** to the status quo]{.underline}.

\(3\) [The third objection]{.underline} comes from the neoreactionary
doctrine: [the **whole pursuit of universalism is misguided**, for we
are particular individuals **so entrenched in the particularities** of
our experiences and ideologies that any recipe for universalism is
**nothing more than a fable for naive ideologues**]{.underline}. My
retort to this third objection is: ok, [let us believe that
universalism, hegemony-construction and consensus-building are **just
the logics of illusion**]{.underline}. But surely your neoreactionary
island requires a certain labor to integrate the like-minded
individuals. In this process, you have assumed that doctrinal
preferences trump over individual preferences, but you are sadly
mistaken. For even in your neoreactionary island, you should deal with
the problems of hegemony and consensus, albeit in a restricted scope. It
is not that your idea of universalism is naïve---even though it really
is but rather that you cannot even fathom the scope of particularities.
[Even in the case of people subscribing to the same agenda, we are
always the creatures of our own particular experiences]{.underline}.

Now, an advocate of neoreaction might object that the institution of
such islands does not require any form of unified ideology or
consensus-building. Biorealism, or cybernetic circuitry of capitalism
and untethered economic competition, can effectively consolidate those
who have enlisted for neoractionary experimentations. But again, [what
is **missing** in such scenarios is a **deeper understanding** of the
scope of human experiential particularities as **dynamic perturbations**
of the system. Over time, **even minor disturbances will have cumulative
effects** which, if **not attended to** in a **context-sensitive
manner**, are **guaranteed to throw the entire system into
disarray**]{.underline}. As for biorealist schemas, even if they were
more than unscientific and dogmatic fantasies about nature---which they
aren't---that could consolidate and orient populations at an accelerated
rate in the fashion depicted by Theodore Sturgeon in his story
Microcosmic God: they will be still impinged upon by norms and personal
desires of individuals. Not to mention, that the apt metaphor for
natural selection is nature as a slow tinkerer rather than a great
accelerator. What I would say to my neoreactionary friends is that to
the extent that they do not take seriously the depths of incommensurable
experiences, their island will eventually sink. For [they
think]{.underline} that in the Hobbesian game-theoretic jungle, [**all
you need to do is to ward off enemies** and **make islands for those who
believe in the same social experimentations**. But as time passes,
the]{.underline} Hobbes [Inferno will **exact its revenge upon you**.
Without an **adequate understanding of particularities** even when a
common ideology or a so-called universal method of pruning is at stake,
you will end up not just **devouring your enemies** but also **eating
your kin alive**]{.underline}.

\(4\) [The final objection comes from various fatalist
doctrines]{.underline}, particularly, [the doctrine of anti-praxis with
its slogan "**let it go**."]{.underline} First of all, I think
[anti-praxis attempts to present itself as a **zero-claim ideology**,
one that has **no claim**, **no practical norm**, and **no recipe for
collective political action**]{.underline}. In this sense, [one can get
the impression that perhaps anti-praxis is more genuine]{.underline}
than the other tenets I listed above, [in so far as it **does not
deceive you with lofty promises of salvation**]{.underline},
emancipation or the great outdoors. [It]{.underline} is what it is and
[stands in sharp contrast to the illusions of collective political
action. However, such an impression is **fundamentally credulous**.
There is **no such a thing as a zero-claim doctrine**]{.underline}. If
we look at the early doctrine of fascism---particularly its Italian
offshoot---we realize that [this is **precisely how fascism took root**.
It began with the claim that we indeed have **no claim**, **no recipe
because all recipes are oppressive**]{.underline}.

[This is not to equate anti-praxis with fascism but to simply point out
that a zero-claim doctrine---one that sees **all practical norms as
oppressive**---is **rife for fascist appropriation**. When the
proponents of anti-praxis tell us that they have **no political norm**
or **recipe**, we should look at them with **utter suspicion**. They are
either trying in the **worst case** to dissimulate their ulterior
motives under the **rubric of ideological innocence** or, in the **best
case**, they are **not conscious of their own implicit practical norms**
because they have **already dispensed** with the responsibility,
authority, presuppositions, and implications involved in consuming and
producing norms. Saying that we must abandon all practical norms is
**already a normative recipe** to the extent that is **predicated on the
impermissibility**---i.e. **what we ought not do**---of **practical
norms**]{.underline}. In this sense, [anti-praxis is **just a false
consciousness** of its so-called lack of normativity or purported
innocence]{.underline}.

Therefore, [either anti-praxis **is** an implicit normative recipe or
**it is not**. If it is, then it is **not really anti-praxis**, and it
means that it is **unaware of its own normative** and/or **practical
assumptions**. If it is **not normatively practical**, then it **must be
a theoretical position** and as such it is **predicated upon theoretical
norms** such as the knowledge of the current state of affairs, and thus
**beholden to epistemological norms** of attaining the knowledge of the
current situation]{.underline}. In other words, [**how do we know** that
the current state of affairs is thus-and-so? Either we have a
**procedure of determination**]{.underline} that is in accordance with
the public norms of doing theory, epistemology, etc, [or it is the case
that anti-praxis assumes we **do not follow** norms of theory (which are
**fundamentally entangled with norms of practical
reasoning**)]{.underline}. In the latter case, anti-praxis is just
another variation of the myth of the given and/or private access to
reality. Or, maybe it is the case that anti-praxis is not even a
theoretical position. In that case, it should be an aesthetic position.
But if that is the case, [it]{.underline} then [**has no purchase** on
the **knowledge of the state of affairs** on which it is built, **nor
does it have any saying as what ought to be done** and **what ought
not**, even **doing nothing**]{.underline}. We should realize that
[doing nothing is **itself a practical norm** to the extent that we
**can only say "do nothing"** insofar as we assume we **ought not do**
such and such things]{.underline}. I would say anti-praxis is more like
a new age monotheistic religion that prohibitively feeds off of
practical norms of other religions, all to present itself as the last
religion you should embrace.

So, in a nutshell, the first concrete recipe of universalism is the
realization of our world: the real world is not a division between us
and them, but a trap or enigma in which we are all ensnared. Aiming
towards the construction a better world, entails seeking more
computational resources. [To see an enemy as an enemy is the **first
unwise strategy**. The enemy]{.underline} is he or she who [**gives us a
perspective otherwise unavailable** to our intuitive or so-called
immediate experience of the world. The abolishment of our pathological
particular traits **can only start** when we diagnose **what these
particularities are** and **strive to change them** by global or
universal conditions]{.underline}.

Fabio Gironi: [Let us move deeper into a **more explicit political
register**]{.underline}. Some of your comments above regarding
universalism and its detractors remind me of the "first law" of
[what]{.underline} the late Mark [Fisher]{.underline} infamously [called
the "**Vampire Castle**,"]{.underline} i.e. [the **priestly**,
**resentment-ridden left-wing intelligentsia**]{.underline}. As he put
it: ["the first law of the Vampires' Castle is: **individualise** and
**privatise everything**. While **in theory** it claims to be in favour
of structural critique, in practice it **never focuses on anything
except individual behaviour**"]{.underline}. Similarly, your polemic
against communitarianism and particularism, and against an understanding
of the "local" as terminal horizon rather than as synthetic step for the
piecemeal construction of a global framework seems in broad agreement
with those political-economic stances that in recent years have been
assimilated under the banner of accelerationism (as most concretely
expounded in Srnicek's and Williams' Inventing the Future). I know that
you were a friend of Fisher, and that you know Srnicek and Williams
well, but can you offer me a clear description of your political stance,
in relation to this broad orthodoxy-breaking and future-oriented trend
in leftist thinking? [Do you have any prescriptive stance regarding
political action?]{.underline}

Reza Negarestani: I'm afraid that my political stance---or rather my
philosophical view concerning what ought to be done in the arena of
politics---oscillates between deep pessimism regarding our methods and
optimism about future possibilities. Yet, [insofar as any possibility
can only be actualized by **adequate** and **malleable methods** and
**tools**, and to the extent that our methods, ways of systematization,
intervention with socio-economic reality and so on are either **quite
rudimentary** or **disoriented** with regard to the realization of
**consequential political changes**, I think I am more comfortable to
identify myself as a **rational pessimist**. I **reject passive
pessimism** in the sense that **as long as possibilities can be
imagined**, we have to **actively gamble** and **push beyond any vestige
of resignation**. **Without imagining possibilities** and **piecewise
attempts at actualizing them**, there is in fact **no good justification
for surviving as a species**]{.underline}. As Seneca has pointed out,
[in **complete absence** of such a struggle, we must perhaps devise the
**most cunning** and **artful contrivance** for bringing our death
about. In that case, even the slogan "**let it go**," once inflated, is
**nothing but a disingenuous pessimism** that attempts to **fabricate a
semblance of profundity**]{.underline}. In reality, it [is the **very
exemplification of human conservatism**]{.underline} and an adolescent
disgruntlement [which **secretly hopes for a miraculous change even when
it tries to seem detached** from such concerns]{.underline}. After all,
[**romantic fatalism** is the **shallowest form** passive optimism,
rather than **genuine pessimism**]{.underline}.

Other than the question of methods and tools, another reason for my
doubt is what I mentioned in my answer to your previous question and
which you brought up through Mark. It is the enigma of the particular.
It is enigmatic precisely because the particular as a real condition can
shapeshift and come in different guises, play different even
contradictory roles in the domains of both the individual and the
collective, the local and the universal piecewise integration and
mobilization of localities. Mark was one of the best critics of the
Hobbesian myth of the state as that which guards the human from their
complete transformation into wolves, as that without which humanity is
inconceivable. In a sense, Mark was far more radical than Hobbes in that
he fathomed the depth of the enigma of the particular. [The particular
can be **pernicious** or even **illusory** through and through. The
**absolutization of the particular**, the individuals---whether in the
name of the **victim**, the **sufferer** or in the name of **individual
choices** and **preferences**---**completely misses the fact** that the
conditions of individuation can **themselves be pathological**. The
overemphasis on the particular or the local]{.underline}, accordingly,
[can **very well**]{.underline} the blind **[perpetuat]{.underline}**ion
of [the **conditions of exploitation** and **misery**]{.underline}. But
particulars can also be positively non-trivial and implicitly collective
perspectives: by making these perspectives explicit, we can shed light
onto the problems of the individual and the collective. However, one
thing is certain---as Mark would have agreed---the depth of
particularities is inexhaustible. So much that, as I argued earlier,
even those who dismiss the universalist labour have to deal with its
drastic implication within their neo-reactionary floating islands.
[Absent a **diagnosis of different kind of particularities**, and short
of **analysing them** with regard to the mechanisms responsible for
generating and distinguishing such causal factors or mechanisms at
different levels of socio-economic reality, we are **all**---and I mean
**everyone**---on the **same Hobbesian Raft of the Medusa**. We will
**eventually betray ourselves** and **eat one another**, irrespective of
whether we think we should strive for a future universalist collective
project, we should denounce such endeavours, or we should do nothing and
just let it go]{.underline}.

Given the endless series of particularities, of individuals, and of
localities, as well as their protean nature, I think that---given our
current tools, modes of thinking and action, methods, etc.---we have at
this point a very slim, if any at all, chance to do anything that leads
us beyond the nightmare of this auto-cannibalistic raft. While I
wholeheartedly support the paradigms raised by people like Patricia
Reed, Nick Srnicek and Alex Williams which are focused on
consensus-building, hegemony-construction and the critical integration
of particularities of the human condition, I think as a philosopher I
should take side with the Socratic method of the courage of truth with
regard to the political action. And as such, I believe the prospects are
now very dim, shockingly so. This claim should not incite the cheer of
the right-inclined, resignatory, neo-reactionary, and conservative
thinkers. If anything, it should lead them to confront the prospects of
their own reality as well in terms of a pure terror, insofar as this dim
prospect is not exclusive to the emancipatory politics to which we have
subscribed but also includes their recipes or the lack thereof.

This brings me to [the]{.underline} main [question]{.underline} you
raised [regarding]{.underline} my [political stance]{.underline}. I
think this question [is predicated on the assumption that we can define
our political position by rummaging through and resorting to the
concretely instantiated political paradigms which have already been
realized and then choose one that fits our methodological and ideal
ambitions]{.underline}. I really fail to see such an exemplification
that I can hold to or define as my political position. [One should
engage a great feat of self-deception to see contemporary political
paradigms as adequate to respond the existing tribulations and
problems]{.underline}. Sure, I am a leftist who believes in the reality
of the class struggle, but this is not really a political position, only
a consciousness of the socio-economic reality. I take seriously Marx and
Engels's thesis that communism "is not a state of affairs which is to be
established, an ideal to which reality (will) have to adjust itself.
Communism is the real movement which abolishes the present state of
things. The conditions of this movement result from the premises now in
existence." This is what I would call---again following Mark---the
possibility of actualizing that which is possible but from our
perspective, here and now, seem impossible. For me [the task of
politics]{.underline} in conjunction with the support of philosophy and
technoscience [is to **not only show**---in **theory** and in
**collective imagination**---that the reality of our world is neither
**inevitable** nor a **completed totality**, but also manages to
**concretely build a new world** from whose perspective our reality will
be **exposed as the illusion** of the inexorable and
finality]{.underline}. But then again, [even this, is **not a clear-cut
political position**. It is merely a **philosophical thesis** on the
**possibility of a different world** and the **range of political
actions** that can fully actualize it.]{.underline}

Fabio Gironi: [You merge this rational pessimism with the "**engineering
approach**" for the construction of a better world]{.underline}, as you
explained before. [To some, this paradigm]{.underline} of political
action [will sound like]{.underline} you are vouching for [a
**dispassionate** and **formalist approach** to politics, and a
government of experts---a "**technocracy**,"]{.underline} something that
in recent times has become anathema in most public discussion (but that,
the critic might enjoy pointing out, has been proven to be a failure at
least since Plato's political misadventure in
Syracuse)---[or]{.underline} even for [a nefarious kind of "**social
engineering**."]{.underline} I suspect that in large part [this depends
precisely on]{.underline} am **[equivocation]{.underline}** about the
very concept of "engineering." In our folk understanding
["engineers,"]{.underline} broadly conceived, [are **often considered
too naive** to deal with the intricacies of politics, a domain fraught
with normative considerations]{.underline}.

[But]{.underline} if I am not mistaken, [your expert engineer is as much
a **technically-minded problem-solver** as it is a **creative conceptual
builder**: a figure that applies]{.underline} his or her [intelligence
to the resolution of problems by means of **more than the unilateral
application of simple formulas** or **pre-packaged
precepts**]{.underline}. Indeed, it seems to me that this is where many
contemporary ideas converge. Srnicek's and Willams' proposal to "move
beyond folk politics and create a new hegemony" and their insistence on
the practical/political concept of "repurposing." Ben Singleton's
reflection on cunning reason (metis) as employed for the strategic and
piecemeal construction of freedom from constraints. And of course, your
own "speculative inquiry into the future of intelligence," or functional
reconceptualization of intelligence as an emancipatory tool of self- and
collective improvement---as well as for practical action upon the
world---where conception and transformation are two sides of the same
coin. Is it then correct to say the concept of "engineering" (rather
different from its "folk" equivalent) is at the core of both your
philosophical and political thinking?

Reza Negarestani: Among computer scientists, there is this joke: when
computer scientists go into a room full of political theorists,
philosophers, cultural critics and linguists, they say to each other,
"get rid of all of them and replace them with engineers." Well, perhaps
this joke is a bit too much but it has a grain of truth. Neither
philosophers nor political theorists are able to design proper methods
adequate to actualize possibilities, imagined or not. [We need
**politically** and **philosophically informed engineers** and
**designers**. Engineers are indeed **not mindless technicians**, they
are people who have **one foot in the domain of thinking** and one in
the realm of an **external reality** or **worldly affairs**. They **do
not see action as a form of hubristic mastery** to the extent that they
know whatever we do at any level of reality]{.underline}---be it
natural, social or cultural---[will meet the resistance of that
reality.]{.underline} To use a Sellarsian metaphor, reality in the
broadest possible sense is not a block of wax ready to be imprinted.
Engineers truly know that. They also never see reality in any sense as a
flat universe, they see it as vast and deeply multi-scaled structure.
[In order to **concretely intervene** at any level of reality we must
not only have a **multi-level view** of the reality but also know
**which methods**, **models** or **tools should be implemented**, and
**at which level**. To **cut at the joints without splintering the
bones**]{.underline} is a description of what engineers---as Plato's
good butchers---do.

There are at least two other important tasks which are deeply entangled
with the discipline and philosophy of engineering. One is the labour of
modelling and the other, the design of approximation techniques. Michael
Weisberg has recently written a wonderful book on models and modelling,
a topic which in the past was not being taken seriously but was central
to engineering. Weisberg elaborates why all our encounters with reality
involve one or another kind of model, for example, descriptive,
explanatory and predictive models. Even what we call empirical data are
not ready-made, they are products of model projection, which means data
can be distorted or even false data may be derived if the model is
inadequate, too small or too big, misapplied to a target system or
applied to a wrong sector of reality. The thing about models is that
they are packed with all sorts of implicit and explicit theoretical,
mathematical, logical and computational assumptions. Such assumptions
encompass not just the model's description but also the core of the
model i.e. the structure and its interpretive factors or construals
which include information about the scope, assignment, and fidelity
criteria of the model itself. The latter criteria pertain to the exact
information which specify the model's representational, dynamic and
resolution constraints for a given level or scale. Without proper
attention to such details and the assumptions underlying them, all data
and facts can be fundamentally distorted or erroneous. The whole myth of
raw or pure data is perpetuated by people who have no clue about how
data is mined---irrespective of what kind of data we are talking about.
The other task, the design of approximation techniques, is even
trickier. Mark Wilson sums up the nature of the approximation techniques
in his new book, Physics Avoidance. Engineers---like Ben Singleton's
designers as embodiments of metis or cunning intelligence---are adept at
trickery, hacking the system and reality. They know that it is not the
best solution to modify a given target system by intervening with lower
levels or fine-grained scales (like for example, the atomic scale-length
of a metal beam). Intervention at such bottom levels is rife for what
Wilson calls computational hazards, due to extreme fine-grained details
of lower levels, any attempt at modification and intervention will
either fail or become sub-optimal. Not to mention that we often lack any
solid grasp of lower level mechanisms, sometimes we don't even have any
indication as what these fine-grained scales are, we can only postulate
them. So what engineers do is first they model scales or levels
pertaining to the structure of the target system or the phenomenon in
question. Such modelling always involves a controlled amount of
simplification and/or idealization which can at a later time be revised
or equipped with more details. Then, they think of how to carefully
bridge lower levels to upper levels where the structure is less
fine-grained and more accessible and more hospitable to intervention and
modification. These bridges---which are essentially mixed-level in that
they contain information regarding middle scales between the bottom and
the top---are called approximation techniques. These are procedures by
which engineers circumvent the messy problems of physics without
forgetting about them. Such techniques allow engineers to modify a given
system optimally without always the need to deal with all sorts of
details which make intervention fundamentally impractical from an
applied perspective, from the computational cost standpoint, etc.

Here, however, a problem arises that André Carus, in his critique of
Wilson's work, has elaborated with the utmost lucidity. What is this
problem? It is the idea that [engineering conceived this way would be
**anti-Enlightenment** in the sense that all we can ever do is to
**reform our local concepts** and **descriptive pragmatic resources** in
a **piecemeal manner**, without hoping to achieve unification. We **can
no longer have ambitious concepts** that can be **applied across the
board**]{.underline}---those global concepts treasured by philosophers
such as the Copernican imperative, reason, freedom, etc. Our situation
is similar to that of a child who plays in the tub and is in command of
a rubber duck. But, of course, the picture of reality is more like that
a river where torrential flows, undertows, and chaotic behaviours take
hold of the rubber duck. In order to make sure this rubber duck sails in
the river, we can no longer adopt a global concept of sail or
navigation. We should have atlases of local theory façades which are
responsive to such turbulent quandaries. And of course, to conform to
such a picture of reality, we can only develop local concepts and
heuristic norms which are informational packages that reflect varying
and non-unifiable perspectives such as the concept of hardness---as for
example applied to a metal beam---which fundamentally varies across
different scale-lengths of the metal structure.

While I have a sympathy for such view, I believe Carus is right. [Our
encounters with reality are **not merely such heuristic** or **pragmatic
devices**. Engineers always have a **main solution**]{.underline}---a
global concept---[in mind. Then they try to **bring various real-time
scenarios** under it such that neither the global concept nor local
pragmatic concepts are **mutually exclusive** but are rather **mutually
positively constraining** and **self-reinforcing**.
Engineering]{.underline}, in this sense, [is about the
**commensuration** of the **local** and the **global**, the **ideal**
and the **messy**, the **strategic** and the **tactical**]{.underline}.
Engineering, therefore, incorporates two senses of the Enlightenment's
rational reconstruction of the world or---to use Carnap's later
term---explication. One in the sense of realism and one in the sense of
idealism, naturalism and constructivism. [To reengineer and recognize
reality, one can neither adopt a universal concept or paradigm nor just
local and perspectival concepts. Both the **overarching paradigm** and
**local malleable solution** are needed]{.underline}.

Now, as you asked, how do we adapt this engineering paradigm to
politics? My friend Ray (Brassier) cautioned me regarding this
unconditional espousal of engineering as a political method. I fully
agree with him. [Politics **fundamentally differs from engineering**
from the perspective of **norms of political action**]{.underline}. The
[philosophically and politically informed engineering as a political
method is predicated on the **hard labour of politics**
which]{.underline}, to a great degree, [consists of **diagnosing our
current situation** and then **deciding how should we move forward**,
the work necessary for arriving the global concept]{.underline}.
However, [I do **disagree** with the idea that]{.underline} unlike the
realm of politics where "what ought to be done" is a matter of
antagonism and consensus-building, [engineering is centred on a
**pre-established conventional norm**]{.underline} (i.e., [**this is
what the system should do**, or **this is the agreed upon
norm**]{.underline} by which the system should behave). Even in
engineering, we know that [the system can have **multiple diverging
trajectories** of evolution. There is **no pre-established norm** or
**consensus** as what the system is and how it should
behave]{.underline}. For engineers, [there is no pre-established
function of a given system since such functions **do change over time**
and **in accordance with local contexts**. Modelling a system is **as
daunting a task** for engineers as it is for political theorists and
activists to **diagnose pathologies of society**, and to **find a way to
eliminate them**. Reality is **not a given totality**: sometimes you
should approach it as a **black box** that can only be unveiled by
**systematically playing** or **intervening with it**. Other times, you
should do the **hard work of modelling under epistemological
constraints**]{.underline}. All in all, the task is to integrate global
concepts with contrasting local concepts.

So yes, in response to your question I take the paradigm of engineering
as a profoundly composite---epistemological and practical---way of
thinking about the world. And [this]{.underline} also
[leads]{.underline} me [to]{.underline} finally answer the question you
posed earlier regarding what can be [the **concrete way** of getting
political ambitions done. Our **first step in a concrete political
project** should be focused on **diagnosing the precise causal mechanism
responsible** for the pathologies of individuation, to **detect the
levels** at which such mechanism are entrenched, and then proceed to
**develop tools to intervene** at those exact levels---like an engineer.
If you **don't have the adequate tools** to intervene at that level,
then **devise approximation techniques**, resolve the problem at a
**different level**. And, again like an engineer, attempt to **lay out
the logic(s)** of existing worlds at different scales. **Make new tools
to construct new worlds** from the **detritus of the old one**. The new
different world is not a miracle]{.underline} or a religious afterlife,
[it is a world **engineered from what is available to us**]{.underline}.
To recapitulate, [we need to **first understand the plural logics** of
this world]{.underline} almost like the multi-level ontologies of
information science [to **even think what ought to be done** and
**decide exactly what methods** or **tools at what level should be
exercised**.]{.underline}

### AT: Debate=Will To Transparency/Predictability

#### They link at the level of [how to play the game]{.underline}, which [outweighs]{.underline} their links and solvency args about [why]{.underline} they play. They are the ones trying to map out debate in form even if they claim to be mysterious in content, they excise otherness from debate by stacking the deck of prep in their favor---which means their vision of debate isn't radically subversive and even if they do collapse debate, it's not in a way that breaks down the logic they critique. You should vote neg for a passion for rules. This resituates the debate game as a totally insular space that [squanders]{.underline} the will to transparency through a de-subjectifying immersion within the experience of the game. Fairness outweighs and link turns all of their offense.

**Forester, 14**---East Tennessee State University (Gus, "Was Gawain a
Gamer?,"
<http://dc.etsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1260&context=honors>,
dml)

The Green Knight's game serves as the catalyst for all these changes. I
see it as no coincidence that Baudrillard claimed, "The world is a
game," and argued that [gaming]{.underline}, in turn, [indicated a
"**passion for rules**"]{.underline} (Baudrillard Live 46, Seduction
131). In understanding the complex mechanisms behind how [a "passion for
rules" can bring about a **utopia of liberation** defined by
hyperreality]{.underline}, I feel that it is appropriate to turn to the
work of the philosopher of sport, Bernard Suits in defining a game. In
his book The Grasshopper he provides his most oftenquoted version of the
definition in his concise claim, "playing a game is the voluntary
attempt to overcome unnecessary obstacles" (Suits 55). In the same book,
he offers an expanded version of the definition:

[To play a game is to attempt to achieve a **specific state of
affairs**]{.underline} \[[prelusory goal]{.underline}\], [using only
means **permitted by rules**]{.underline} \[[lusory
means]{.underline}\], [where the rules **prohibit use** of **more
efficient** in favour of **less efficient means**]{.underline}
\[[constitutive rules]{.underline}\], [and where the rules are accepted
**just because they make possible such activity**]{.underline} \[[lusory
attitude]{.underline}\] (54-55).

Perhaps the most complex, but important, part of Suits's definition is
his concept of "[constitutive rules]{.underline}." Although the Gawain
critic Victor Yelverton Haines rejects Suits's definition on the basis
that a game world can exist with "God-made laws," Suits anticipates and
refutes such an argument later in The Grasshopper (Haines 223). Suits
uses the example of mountain climbing, arguing that even in a world
where an elevator cannot be used to get to the top, a mountain climber
would still be adhering to the game's constitutive rules because they
would reject such means if available. Thus, Suits's phrase, "less
efficient means," does not literally mean that there must be more
efficient [means]{.underline}, but [that the player partakes in the
means allowed by the game **purely for the sake of doing such** and
would **reject more efficient means** if they were
available]{.underline}. This is key to Suits's later argument that a
"utopia" would effectively be a world where everyone plays games all day
every day. [To game is essentially to do what one desires **purely
because it satisfies that desire** and **without any grander utilitarian
purposes** for doing such]{.underline}. Thus, [from the vision of a
utopia as a world built on satisfying desires and which removes any
barriers in doing such, **no other conception of a utopia is
possible**.]{.underline}

The most obvious counterargument one could use against Suits's claim is
that there are other activities that can be described as having no
purpose beyond satisfying desires for their own sake. Suits himself does
not address why a utopia would be defined by gaming instead of, for
example, pornography or action movies. My argument would be that Suits's
definition with its requirement of [a prelusory goal **presupposes some
possibility of failure** built into the game, whereas the closest thing
in other forms of entertainment is to **simply quit**. This is a **key
distinction**. Because one **cannot fail at movies** and **similar
pursuits**, viewers]{.underline} are put in the position of passively
carting to the finish line and, thus, **[cannot escape]{.underline}**
consummating Baudrillard's [characterization of the masses as
"**objects**." Because, as has been claimed, "there is nothing outside
the text," art forms that are driven by passive interpretation **can
only exist** as artifacts of the **grander political
system**]{.underline} that spawned them. [This is **reversed** in games.
The **possibility of failure** allows for a system where not only can
the gamer **restore their role as the subject** by **crafting their own
active experience**, but it is a **necessity** if a gamer **desires to
continue playing**]{.underline}. As Friedrich Nietzsche wrote, "That
which is done out of love always takes place beyond good and evil"
(103). [This importance of **active experience** in gaming means that
the political realm of textual interpretation that dominates other art
forms is **forced into a secondary role** to the **apolitical realm of
passion**]{.underline}.

This is what Baudrillard describes in the phrase, "passion for rules."
Although Bernard Suits was attempting to define the act of playing a
game, [it would **not be a stretch** to view]{.underline} his conception
of [constitutive rules as **comprising the game itself**]{.underline}.
And [if "**The world is a game**]{.underline}," as Baudrillard claims it
is, [what can a reality be but **a set of rules one
accepts**]{.underline}? Yet, whereas the writer can only describe a
reality with an existence dependent on surrounding political systems
(because, again, "there is nothing outside the text"), [the gamer, in
**directly interacting with a set of rules**, participates in a new
reality **independent of the outside world**]{.underline}. In this
sense, [games are **realer than**]{.underline} the Platonic [**real**
because, instead of ending at the representations, games turn them into
instruments that are used to gain a deeper interaction with the senses
that make such representations possible. Thus, in its ideal form, gaming
aims to **realize the passions of the real** in a form exaggerated
**beyond what the rules of the real allow**. Gaming is]{.underline}, as
Suits posits, [the **antithesis to labor** in that it **not only offers
liberation**, but it uses the opportunities offered by liberation to
**construct a new reality built around pleasure** while minimizing any
inconveniences. Herein lies the link between the **realization of a
democratic utopia**, **gaming**, and **rules**]{.underline}. In a
liberated world, immersion in [gaming's hyperreality]{.underline} is the
likely result because it [allows for the **ultimate liberation from
liberation**]{.underline}.

Before I analyze the poem using this system, however, there is one more
crucial addition to be made to Suits's theory of gaming. Although he
adequately covers both the requirements and purpose behind gaming, he is
missing an additional factor that must be present to bridge the gap
between theory and practice, allowing the player to extract pleasure
from the game's framework. That factor has commonly been argued as
"immersion," but to fully understand what immersion is, I feel it is
appropriate to reconsider the full implications behind Baudrillard's
theory of hyperreality. Hyperreality inherently draws into question the
concept of not only an objective reality, but also a single subjective
reality. Rather, [a world of hyperreality is one of an infinite number
of equally valid realities competing to immerse the individual. With
this, the distinction between fact and fiction collapses]{.underline}. A
news story, an action movie, and even Baudrillard's own philosophy all
coalesce into competing realities. In this light, Samuel Taylor
Coleridge's [**suspension-of-disbelief** must be viewed as a **crucial
element** in]{.underline} not only art but also in [**any experience
possible**, because it describes the individual's]{.underline}
unconscious (or, possibly, conscious) [effort to filter out excess
information that would interfere with emotional investment in a
particular reality. I will refer to this]{.underline} phenomenon of
successful [suspension-of-disbelief]{.underline} that makes possible the
passions of gaming [as "**immersion**."]{.underline}

For the reasons that I have given, [to **engage with the constitutive
rules** of a game is not merely to engage in a **leisurely activity**
but to engage with a **construction of a new reality**]{.underline}. As
I have explained, [the **possibility of failure** is an **important
part**]{.underline} of that reality, [but it should not be taken as my
claiming that winning **does not matter**]{.underline}. Rather,
[**winning** and **losing** are **both equally important** because the
existence of one **presupposes of the other** and the passions derived
from either one are **dependent** on its **complex interactions with the
other**. For **either winning** and **losing** in a game to be
**possible** however, **the rules of the game must be accepted by the
player**]{.underline}, that is to say [**one must first be playing the
game**. Behind **even the passions of winning** and **losing**, in
**every player** there lies a deeper reason for playing in the
**immersion** that **ultimately makes the aforementioned passions
possible**]{.underline}. b Thus, the term "role-playing game" becomes a
useless term, insofar as that [the goal of every game is to **enjoy the
passions** of playing a role **made possible by the
rules**]{.underline}. Giving immersion a central role in gaming also
puts the act of gaming in more of a sliding scale based on the gamer's
engagement with the game world, rather than the absolute of either
playing a game or not as Suits seems to suggest.

However, this emphasis on immersion also reveals my major point of
divergence with Baudrillard's own views on gaming, specifically his
seemingly interchangeable usage of the term with gambling. The videogame
critic Alex Kierkegaard argues, "scoring in games creates a game OUTSIDE
the game (the king-of-the-ladder game), while demoting the actual game
to a minigame" (Web). I don't agree with his application of his claim,
in that the scoring driving the "king-of-ladder-game" mentioned exists
exclusively as a summarization of actions within the actual game, but I
do think the claim has merit when applied to playing for cash or other
prizes with value created outside the game (gambling). Again, my view of
gaming as a vehicle for immersion allows the activity to represent more
of a sliding scale than an absolute, but gambling's emphasis on prizes
for their value outside of the game undeniably places it on the lower
end of the scale. The reason [the act of playing for something **greater
than the game itself**]{.underline} (which I will hereafter refer to as
gambling, though gambling can admittedly be a very immersive game if
played as an end in itself) [is **opposed to gaming**]{.underline} can
be seen in two ways. Most clearly, [if something is viewed as **being
greater than the game**, the immersion is **irreparably damaged**
because the game **merely becomes a currency** within some greater world
rather than **a world in itself**]{.underline}. Secondly, and less
obviously, gambling gives the game a definite endpoint. This is a less
than preferable attribute of a game because, if we view gaming as aiming
to create a reality more immersive and, thus, more passsionate that of
the outside, it follows that it should continue to immerse the player as
long as the player's body can allow.

[The ultimate game would be one that can be **replayed
indefinitely**]{.underline}. Gawain's apparent rejection of the
elaborate pentagram to accept the simpler circular shape of the girdle
serves as the perfect symbol for his wholehearted acceptance of the
simple pleasures comprising the passions of gaming's loop over the
elaborate rituals of the chivalric hegemony. [On one side, there
is]{.underline} masochism, comprising the traditionally "negative"
emotions of **[defeat]{.underline}** such as anger and frustration, [and
on the other side is]{.underline} sadism, comprising the traditionally
"positive" emotions of **[victory]{.underline}** such as dominance and
accomplishment. [Seeking **only extreme passion**, a great player lives
as the **embodiment** of]{.underline} Nietzsche's concept of [**amor
fati**.]{.underline} That is to say he \[[they\]
understand]{.underline}s [that **neither state is inherently better**
and **enjoys them both in themselves**, though the illusion that one
might be better **serves as a motivation** for the player's actions. The
resulting **drive towards victory** and the **many inevitable defeats**
that it brings merely serve as **vital illusions** to make possible the
**true ecstasy of reversal** of the two extremes]{.underline}. As
Baudrillard writes, "**[The supreme orgasm is
metamorphosis]{.underline}**" (Fatal Strategies 160).

### AT: Deliberation Excludes Affect

#### They have sequencing [backwards]{.underline}---it's not that we have to make deliberation [affective]{.underline}, we have to make affect [deliberative]{.underline}---affective redescriptions are [only useful]{.underline} insofar as they [facilitate deliberative testing]{.underline} based on [shared understanding]{.underline}---this [straight turns]{.underline} their offense

**Livingston, 12**---Assistant prof of Government @ Cornell (Alexander,
"Avoiding Deliberative Democracy? Micropolitics, Manipulation, and the
Public Sphere", Philosophy & Rhetoric, Vol. 45, No. 3 (2012), pp.
269-294, dml)

To put this in the language of Deleuze, [deliberative
redescription]{.underline} can function as a war machine. The
experimenting with resonating reasons in a public on the part of
activists is an exercise in "plugging in" a resonance machine into the
public sphere. The transformative power of the resonance machine,
understood as an inventive redescription of our received practices, [has
the power to **transform the way citizens see their shared
world**]{.underline}, their own interests, and the suffering of others.
[The work of counterpublics is to "smooth" the striated space of public
political culture]{.underline} so as [to]{.underline} displace old
prejudices and [allow new identities and claims to
flourish]{.underline}.

But if this is so, then [deliberative democracy **does not stop here**.
This "weaponry" of redescription is of value only **insofar as it opens
up conceptual spaces for reason giving**. It is **here**]{.underline},
along this destratified plane, [that citizens and spectators have to
make use of]{.underline} what Deleuze calls ["**tools**" to build up
**reasoned** but **revisable agreements** about **what causes to
pursue**, **what practices to quash**, or **which candidates to elect**
or **kick out**]{.underline}. Indeed, [the creative work of
redescription is only **the mise-en-scène** of a democratic praxis
through which ordinary people **offer** and **contest** what they think
to be **good arguments** and **reasons** about political issues. It is
**only** through the reflective pursuit of overlapping agreement that
**collective action becomes possible**]{.underline}. \[End Page 287\]

Once we see all this, that the modern public sphere is an indefinite
sphere for the circulation and contestation of expansive reasons, we
have grounds for questioning Connolly's characterization of deliberative
intellectualism. Recall that [this claim is that deliberative democrats
are captured by too narrow a vision of thought]{.underline}, one [that
makes no place for the visceral and affective registers of
thinking]{.underline}. I want to turn [this argument]{.underline} around
and suggest that Connolly himself [**focuses too closely** on the moral
psychology of the individual citizen and **does not give enough
credence** to the **decentered institutional registers** by which
deliberative persuasion takes place. The public sphere serves as **a
mediating institution** between the visceral and the conceptually
articulate, the actual and the virtual.]{.underline}

Connolly describes the visceral register and the amygdala as inscribing
cultural values and judgments directly into the "soft tissue" of
thought. Connolly's [argument hinges on the claim that what the body
remembers]{.underline}, in this visceral sense of proto-thoughts, [is
both distinct from and more concrete than the conceptually refined
thinking of reasoned argumentation]{.underline}. But [when this argument
is refracted through a critical theory of the public sphere, the
dichotomy between visceral and intellectual]{.underline} he introduces
**[falls flat]{.underline}**. Of course the limbic system and even the
stomach can be said to learn cultural codes, discourses, and symbolic
orders. Yet [these codes and discourses are]{.underline} themselves
[primarily linguistic orders that circulate at the level of reasons and
understandings in the public sphere]{.underline}. They are precisely the
sorts of discourses that circulate in the public sphere [and are thus
subject to its **rationalizing**, **radicalizing**, and **democratizing
power**]{.underline}. While you cannot argue with the disgust you feel
in your stomach directly, [the kinds of understandings that provoke that
disgust are part of a lifeworld that reproduces itself through the
exchange of reasons]{.underline}. For example, the relatively recent
transformation in the popular perception of smoking from something
innocuous to something disgusting over is a clear example of how the
publicization of reasons to avoid smoking, combined with cultural
practices that reflect and rearticulate these reasons (bans on smoking
indoors, more explicit warnings about health costs, etc.), feed back
into the visceral judgments about its value. [It is at the level
**critical publicity**, **not visceral manipulation alone**, that these
discourses are **challenged** and **transformed**]{.underline}.

Negotiation

[Tactics and techniques alone are **insufficient** for reinvigorating
democracy]{.underline} in our late-modern world. [**Cooperation**,
**deliberation**, and **collective action** are needed **first** and
**foremost**]{.underline}. But does Connolly really frame the \[End Page
288\] distinction between the two in such stark terms? Surely this way
of putting the point must overstate the case. As I have mentioned, he
issues a number of caveats that stress that he is not to be taken as
suggesting that he sees no value in deliberation or public reason. As we
have also seen, however, [the power of dialogue and mutual understanding
can have little place in his vision of politics owing his critique of
intellectualism and his Deleuzian micropolitics. He foregrounds the
multiple registers of thinking, an ethics of self-care, and a
micropolitics of manipulation]{.underline}, all the [while
**downplaying** the issues of **the public sphere**, **publicity**, and
**political dialogue**]{.underline}. But there is another theme lurking
in the background of Connolly's texts. Behind the celebration of ethics
and micropolitics there are vague but regular appeals to another
ingredient in his ethos of pluralism. It is something he refers to, all
too in often in passing, as negotiation (1999, 35, 92, 143, 186; 2002,
138; 2005, 65, 123--26).21

[An ethos of pluralism may come about through **tactical interventions
into the visceral** but also through a **modus vivendi** negotiated
between **interdependent parties** who honor different "final moral
sources." In negotiation, the parties bring their comprehensive
conceptions to bear on issues of political disagreement]{.underline}.
According to Connolly, [negotiation is a conception of political
dialogue that **abstains** from hiding behind a privileged]{.underline}
Kantian [account of right that magically floats above the messy world of
competing conceptions of the good]{.underline}. Rather, [it takes place
between the **unavoidable conceptions of the good** that citizens bring
to politics]{.underline}. [This thick negotiation means that deeply held
convictions]{.underline} about religion, the good, and so on [are **put
on the table** and are **opened up to the scrutiny** and **critique of
others**. To endure the agon of opening oneself up in this way, **all**
parties need to acknowledge the "**comparative contestability**" of
their fundaments]{.underline}; that is, citizens need to acknowledge
that their conception of the good is just one among others and that they
have no special privilege or insight that would make it right for them
to impose their understanding of the good on others (1999, 8). [Trying
to reach some understanding across these differences, in a situation in
which the interdependence of identities and interests is not something
abstracted from deliberation but the very substance of it, is the hard
work of an agonistic democratic politics]{.underline}. Shared
understandings or [consensus are]{.underline} of course [not the likely
outcome]{.underline} of this sort of negotiation, [but good negotiation
will make for **revised self-understandings** and maybe even **some sort
of self-transformation** of the participants involved]{.underline}.
[Good negotiation,]{.underline} as Connolly calls it, [shares
information, challenges prejudices, and produces]{.underline} \[End Page
289\] [a degree of mutual respect, or rather an affirmation of "
comparative contestability," when agreement is not
possible]{.underline}. That is, good negotiation is good deliberation.

Rereading his comments on resonance machines from the perspective of his
comments on negotiation gives a different impression of how Connolly
thinks a transformative democratic politics ought to function. That is,
[**folding the politics of affective infusion** into an **agonistic**
but **respectful process of negotiation** begins to look a lot more like
the redescriptive politics of the public sphere proposed by deliberative
democracy]{.underline}. The generous ethos of public engagement Connolly
champions as negotiation, then, appears to be an instance of
deliberative democracy, not an alternative or even a supplement to it.
However, his account of negotiation is incomplete as it stands.
Connolly's negotiation captures the normative concerns of deliberative
democracy but lacks the accompanying explanatory function of a critical
theory of deliberative democracy. [Where are the fora of this
negotiation **if not in the public sphere**, and how do these moments of
responsive negotiation add up to displace the stingy sensibility that
has puts a strangle hold on a more civil and egalitarian public
ethos?]{.underline} [Without a revised account of how negotiation
contributes to a democratic public sphere---through **participating in
it**, **drawing on it** as a resource, transforming its subjectless
claims, and **being transformed by them** in turn---negotiation **lacks
the critical resources** to **mobilize a democratic left**
today]{.underline}. Torn between the adversarial and manipulative
politics of war machines on one side and an ethically sensitive
negotiation that seeks understandings and mutual respect on the other,
Connolly's recipe for a democratic reinvigoration of the left oscillates
back and forth between a worrisome politics that would subvert popular
reflection and a dialogical art that would provoke it. [A critical
theory of the public sphere]{.underline}, however, [closes this gap and
finds room for both power and legitimacy, strategy and communication,
within a sociologically complex defense of a radical alternative:
deliberative democracy]{.underline}. \[End Page 290\]

### AT: Literal Meaning Impossible

#### Gut check---none of their language games or paradoxes really matter---despite all this philosophy babble, you're still flowing this speech and processing its meaning...

#### Literal meanings are dicey, but intersubjective agreement is possible based on reasonable interpretation. Their arg just proves topicality solves their offense because we can debate about suitable definitions---hence the limits DA

We\'ve seen that [sloppy or misleading use of]{.underline} ordinary
[language can seriously limit our ability to]{.underline} create and
[communicate]{.underline} correct reasoning. As philosopher John Locke
pointed out three centuries ago, [the achievement]{.underline} of human
knowledge [is often hampered by the use of words without fixed
signification. **Needless controversy is** sometimes **produced** and
perpetuated]{.underline} **[by]{.underline}** an unacknowledged
**[ambiguity in the application of key terms]{.underline}**. We can
distinguish disputes of three sorts: [Genuine disputes involve
disagreement about whether or not some specific proposition is
true]{.underline}. Since the people engaged in a genuine dispute agree
on the meaning of the words by means of which they convey their
respective positions, each of them can propose and assess logical
arguments [that might eventually lead to a resolution of their
differences]{.underline}. Merely verbal disputes, on the other hand,
arise entirely from ambiguities in the language used to express the
positions of the disputants. A verbal dispute disappears entirely once
the people involved arrive at an agreement on the meaning of their
terms, since doing so reveals their underlying agreement in belief.
Apparently verbal but really genuine disputes can also occur, of course.
In cases of this sort, the resolution of every ambiguity only reveals an
underlying genuine dispute. Once that\'s been discovered, it can be
addressed fruitfully by appropriate methods of reasoning. [We can save a
lot of time, sharpen our reasoning abilities, and communicate with each
other more effectively if we watch for disagreements about the meaning
of words and try to resolve them whenever we can]{.underline}. Kinds of
Definition [The most common way of preventing]{.underline} or
eliminating [differences in the use of languages is by agreeing on the
definition of our terms]{.underline}. Since these explicit accounts of
the meaning of a word or phrase can be offered in distinct contexts and
employed in the service of different goals, it\'s useful to distinguish
definitions of several kinds: [A lexical definition simply reports the
way in which a term is already used within a language
community]{.underline}. The goal here is to inform someone else of the
accepted meaning of the term, so the definition is more or less correct
depending upon the accuracy with which it captures that usage. In these
pages, my definitions of technical terms of logic are lexical because
they are intended to inform you about the way in which these terms are
actually employed within the discipline of logic. At the other extreme,
[a stipulative definition freely assigns meaning]{.underline} to a
completely new term, creating a usage that had never previously existed.
Since the goal in this case is to propose the adoption of shared use of
a novel term, there are no existing standards against which to compare
it, and the definition is always correct (though it might fail to win
acceptance if it turns out to be inapt or useless). If I now decree that
we will henceforth refer to Presidential speeches delivered in French as
\"glorsherfs,\" I have made a (probably pointless) stipulative
definition. [Combining these two techniques is]{.underline} often [an
effective way to reduce the vagueness of a word or phrase. These
precising definitions begin with the lexical definition of a term but
then propose to **sharpen it by stipulating more narrow limits** on its
use]{.underline}. Here, [the lexical part must be correct and the
stipulative portion should appropriately reduce the troublesome
vagueness]{.underline}. If the USPS announces that \"proper notification
of a change of address\" means that an official form containing the
relevant information must be received by the local post office no later
than four days prior to the effective date of the change, it has offered
a (possibly useful) precising definition.
