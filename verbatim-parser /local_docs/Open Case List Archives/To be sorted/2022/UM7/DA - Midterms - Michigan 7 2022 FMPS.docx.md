Democrats are widely seen as the underdogs in the 2022 midterm
elections, with the party expected to suffer substantial losses and
likely lose control of at least one chamber of Congress. In this

crowds with the Flag of the USA, America The serving president\'s party
usually performs poorly during midterms. However, that doesn\'t mean
they always suffer a wipeout---and [certain conditions could set the
stage for a surprise comeback for President Joe Biden and the
Democrats]{.underline}. Biden Admits Democrats Don\'t Have Votes To
Bypass Filibuster To Codify Roe Perhaps the most obvious is the U.S.
Supreme Court\'s decision to overturn the landmark abortion rulings Roe
v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, which found that a woman\'s
right to abortion was constitutionally protected. It remains to be seen
if the Court\'s ruling will affect turnout. However, **[if Democratic
voters and women are motivated by a desire to protect abortion access,
Biden\'s party might just beat the odds]{.underline}**. The best-case
scenario for Democrats would be retaining control of both the House of
Representatives and the Senate---and perhaps making net gains in both
chambers. Holding the Senate The U.S. Senate is currently divided
between 50 Republicans, 48 Democrats and two independents who caucus
with the Democrats. This has meant that Vice President Kamala Harris has
had to use her casting vote on several occasions. [**Poll tracker
FiveThirtyEight\'s 2022 election forecast rates the Senate as a toss-up
with Democrats defending 14 seats and Republicans 21, but there is
some** room for Democratic gains]{.underline}. The Pennsylvania Senate
race is a toss-up as Republican Senator Pat Toomey is retiring. If
Democratic Lt. Governor John Fetterman can defeat Republican Dr. Mehmet
Oz, that will go a long way to holding the Senate. Democrats could also
make gains in potentially close races that FiveThirtyEight rates as
leaning Republican---Wisconsin and North Carolina---and could even score
an upset victory in Ohio. However, incumbent Democrats in close races
will also have to win re-election if the party hopes to maintain control
of the Senate. FiveThirtyEight rates the races in Georgia, Nevada and
Arizona as toss-ups. All those seats are currently held by Democrats. If
everything goes right for Democrats on election day, they could end up
with 54 seats---still shy of the 60 votes needed to overcome the
filibuster. This outcome seems unlikely, however. Keeping the House
It\'s a different picture in the House of Representatives, where
Republicans are favored to win, according to FiveThirtyEight\'s
analysis. Democrats currently hold 220 seats to Republicans\' 210, while
five seats are vacant. The president\'s party will need 218 seats to
keep the chamber. FiveThirtyEight argues that even if Democrats hold all
their current seats and win all the toss-up races, it will not be enough
to hand them the majority. A Democratic [victory in the House
appears]{.underline} to require a major shakeup in the dynamics of the
midterm elections. That is **[possible---especially given likely ongoing
controversy over abortion laws and investigations into the role some
Republicans played in efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential
election.]{.underline}** The election could throw up a so-called
\"October surprise\" that changes the course of the race in Democrats\'
favor, but right now that seems a distant prospect. It also seems
unlikely that neither chamber will change hands. The last time that
happened was in 1998, when Republicans held both the House and Senate
despite modest Democratic gains in the House and some changes in the
composition of the Senate. It\'s worth noting that at that time,
Republicans\' failure to make gains was seen as a major surprise. If
Democrats can buck the trend and keep the House, it will be considered a
significant victory and could see Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi
remain in the leadership amid recent speculation about her future.
Biden\'s Agenda and 2024 The outcome of the November elections will have
a major impact on two issues heading into 2023: whether President Biden
can implement his agenda and the 2024 presidential race. If Republicans
take control of either chamber of Congress, they will be able to stymie
the president\'s agenda, preventing the passage of legislation and, if
they control the Senate, stopping Biden from filling any vacancy that
might arise on the Supreme Court. Even narrow Democratic majorities in
the House and Senate would make matters easier for the administration,
while surprise victories could give Biden the legislative firepower he
needs to pass stalled measures such as the \$1.75 trillion Build Back
Better plan. Democrats keeping the House would also prevent Republicans
launching a series of investigations into the administration - which
they are reportedly already planning - and stop those potential
investigations from dominating the political agenda in the run up to
2024. Threats of impeachment against Biden from some quarters of the
Republican Party would also become meaningless if Democrats retain both
houses of Congress, removing another potential headache for the
president.

#### Plenty of competitive races that mean the dem's can still come out on top 

- Democracy warrants

John **Harwood 22**, 6-26-2022, \"Democrats still have this glimmer of
hope for the midterm elections,\" CNN,
https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/26/politics/midterm-elections-democrats/index.html

President Joe Biden can\'t avoid a bad midterm election. But **[with a
boost last week from the US Supreme Court, he still might avoid the
worst.]{.underline}** A bad election means losing the Democratic
majority in the US House of Representatives, which his own party\'s
strategists now consider virtually certain. A Republican-controlled
House would roadblock his legislative agenda, investigate his
administration and family, and perhaps even impeach him \--
notwithstanding the absence of legitimate cause. The worst means losing
the Senate, too. Returned to the job of majority leader, Mitch McConnell
could deny Biden the ability to fill top administration jobs and
judicial vacancies \-- including any potential vacancy on the Supreme
Court. Both outcomes will be shaped by the same atmospheric conditions,
which for months have strongly favored the GOP. But fortunately for the
beleaguered Biden, critical House and Senate contests sometimes move in
different ways. Voters know less about individual House members and
their challengers. That leaves competitive House races largely at the
mercy of a national mood soured by inflation worries and disappointment
with Biden. Though gerrymandering of House districts leaves only a few
truly competitive ones, that pool of targets appears plenty large enough
to place the speaker\'s gavel in GOP hands. Republicans need a net gain
of only four seats \-- a fraction of the average historical gain for the
party not holding the White House \-- to recapture the majority. In a
Senate now split 50-50, Republicans need a net gain of only one seat.
But that won\'t come as easily. More than House members, higher-profile
senators and their challengers have some ability to create their own
political weather. [In competitive races, they invariably have plenty of
cash for campaign advertising to burnish their own images and tar their
opponents\'. A higher profile can magnify the assets of strong
candidates and the liabilities of weak ones]{.underline}. [Republicans
worry most about the latter, having watched inept nominees blow several
winnable Senate races when their party was in the minority in 2010 and
2012]{.underline}. The 10 Senate seats most likely to flip in 2022 Since
only one-third of Senate seats are up in any single election, partisan
outcomes hinge largely on which seats those are. In 2018, even as the
unpopularity of then-President Donald Trump helped Democrats recapture
the House, Republicans netted two Senate seats because that campaign
included battleground races in reliably red states such as Missouri,
North Dakota and Indiana. In 2022, the political geography is decidedly
blue. Democrats can hold the Senate merely by reelecting incumbents in
Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and New Hampshire \-- all states Biden won in
2020. If they can\'t keep them all, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin provide
chances to flip Republican seats in two more states Biden won. \"I\'ve
never seen a map this good\" for an embattled majority party, observed
Amy Walter, editor of the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. On that
auspicious battlefield, Democrats have lately acquired fresh ammunition.
On Capitol Hill, the House select committee investigating the January 6,
2021, insurrection has laid out in riveting detail the lengths to which
Trump and his allies went in their attempt to overturn the American
people\'s verdict in the 2020 election. And at the Supreme Court, new
rulings have demonstrated the willingness of GOP-appointed conservative
justices to defy majority opinion and its own precedents on the most
volatile issues roiling the country. First, the court expanded the
constitutional right to bear arms by striking down a century-old New
York law limiting residents\' right to carry concealed weapons. Then a
5-4 majority erased the constitutional right to abortion that women had
for the last half-century as a result of its earlier Roe vs. Wade
ruling. Taken together, those developments highlight Biden\'s warnings
about the radicalism and extremism of Trump\'s \"Make America Great
Again\" movement. **[Democratic candidates crave the chance to shift the
electorate\'s attention from the economic concerns weighing down the
White House to more fundamental questions about American
democracy]{.underline}**. \"Is the disappointment in Biden a more
powerful force than fear of MAGA?\" asked Simon Rosenberg, president of
the New Democratic Network, a think tank. \"I just don\'t know that\'s
the case.\" These **[lines of Democratic attack place particular
pressure on untested GOP candidates who seem to match the portrait
Democrats paint]{.underline}**. In Georgia, a prime Senate Republican
target, ex-football star Herschel Walker has favored a complete abortion
ban that even bars exceptions for rape, incest or threats to the
woman\'s life. Walker has also struggled with personal controversies and
odd public pronouncements in his bid to oust Democratic Sen. Raphael
Warnock. GOP strategists acknowledge that the abortion issue, in
particular, adds a wild card for mobilizing Democratic voters. But the
specter of MAGA governance, they insist, will ultimately get swamped by
discontent with the economy and the nation\'s general direction. \"It\'s
not going to have nearly enough traction,\" said veteran GOP pollster
Neil Newhouse. A few intraparty dissidents remain uncertain. Mike
Madrid, a California-based Republican consultant who worked to defeat
Trump in 2020, sees the outcome turning on the relative magnitude of two
opposing trends: the drift of suburban White women toward Democrats and
blue-collar Hispanic men toward Republicans. By cooperating with
Democrats on gun safety legislation, McConnell told reporters last week,
he hopes to reverse enough of those suburban defections. But \"to
believe that\'s a foregone conclusion,\" Madrid said, \"is silly.\"

#### Democratic voter's are motivated to turn out now but any shift in the political environment means republican win congress 

Nate **Silver 22**, 6-30-2022, Silver is the founder and editor in chief
of FiveThirtyEight.\"Why Republicans Are Favored To Win The House, But
Not The Senate,\" FiveThirtyEight,
https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-republicans-are-favored-to-win-the-house-but-not-the-senate/

[Republicans are substantial favorites to take over the U.S. House of
Representatives]{.underline} following this November's midterm
elections, **[but]{.underline}** [the U.S. Senate is much more
competitive, according to FiveThirtyEight's 2022 midterm election
forecast]{.underline}, which launched today. Democrats are also favored
to hang on to the governorships in a trio of swing states in the Rust
Belt --- Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan --- although they are
significant underdogs to win high-profile gubernatorial races in Georgia
and Texas against Republican incumbents. The split diagnosis reflects
the difference between macro- and micro-level conditions. The national
environment is quite poor for Democrats. Of course, this is typical for
the president's party, which has lost seats in the House in all but two
of the past 21 midterm elections. But Democrats are also saddled with an
unpopular President Biden and a series of challenges for the country,
including inflation levels that haven't been seen in decades, the
lingering effects of the still-ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and fraying
trust in civic institutions --- caused, in part, by Republican efforts
to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Democrats, as a
predominantly urban party, also face a longstanding problem in the
Senate, where every state has equal representation regardless of its
population, resulting in a substantial built-in bias toward white, rural
states. And although **[Democrats are very slightly better off following
the redistricting process in the House than they were under the 2020
maps]{.underline}**, there are still more Republican-leaning seats than
Democratic-leaning ones. True, the political environment is dynamic.
**[The Supreme Court's decision last week to overturn Roe v. Wade is too
recent to be fully reflected in polls,]{.underline}** but there are
reasons to think **[it will help Democrats]{.underline}**. Roe, which
granted the constitutional right to abortion, was a popular precedent,
and [Democratic voters are more likely than Republican ones to say the
decision will encourage them to vote at the midterms.]{.underline}
Moreover, in striking down Roe and other popular laws like restrictions
against the concealed carry of firearms, the **[Supreme Court has in
some ways undermined one of the traditional reasons that the president's
party tends to lose seats at the midterms.]{.underline}** Typically,
**[voters like some degree of balance]{.underline}**: They do not want
one party to have unfettered control of all levers of government. But
the Supreme Court, with its 6-3 conservative majority, is a reminder of
how much power Republicans have even if they don't control the White
House. The insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on **[Jan. 6]{.underline}**
can also **[serve as a reminder to voters about what might happen if the
Electoral College certification process takes place in 2024 amid
Republican control of both chambers of Congress]{.underline}**.1
Democrats have had trouble getting the public to treat threats to
democracy as a high priority, but polls do show that the public is
sympathetic to the Democrats' case, especially after the recent
congressional hearings on the events of Jan. 6. So, this is not a
typical, low-stakes midterm election. On the contrary, there are [strong
forces tugging at each side of the rope]{.underline}, some of which are
potentially of existential importance. But Democrats' majorities in both
chambers of Congress are narrow, the historical precedent toward the
president's party losing seats is strong, and polls so far --- such as
the generic congressional ballot, which asks voters which party they
would support in an election --- suggest that voters slightly prefer
Republican control of Congress. Or at least that's the story in the
House, where there are dozens of competitive races and candidates are
relatively anonymous. There, big-picture factors tend to prevail. An
unusually weak Republican candidate in one district might be
counteracted by a strong one in another, for example. In the Senate and
gubernatorial races, by contrast, individual factors can matter more.
And the GOP has nominated --- or is poised to nominate --- candidates
who might significantly underperform a "generic" Republican based on
some combination of inexperience, personal scandals or having
articulated unpopular conservative positions. This is not a new problem
for Republicans: underqualified or fringy candidates have cost them
seats in the Senate in other recent cycles. So let's briefly run through
the model's forecast for House, Senate and gubernatorial races. Then
I'll describe some changes to the model since 2020 --- which are modest
this year but reflect how congressional races are changing in an
increasingly polarized political environment. The [House
Republicans]{.underline} have an 87 percent [chance of taking over the
House]{.underline}, according to the Deluxe version of our model. That's
**[far from certain, but Democrats are fighting the odds:]{.underline}**
Their 13 percent chances are equivalent to tossing a coin and having it
come up tails three times in a row. Ball-swarm (or bee-swarm) chart
showing which party wins control of the House in 100 sample outcomes
from our Deluxe model's 40,000 simulations, where Democrats have a 13
percent chance of winning the chamber and Republicans have a 87 percent
chance. That's not to say House control will be a matter of luck,
exactly. A **[change in the political environment could have ripple
effects]{.underline}**. For instance, sometimes one party wins nearly
all the toss-up races, as Republicans did in 2020. However, even if
Democrats were to win all 13 races that our model currently designates
as "toss-ups" (meaning that no party has more than a 60 percent chance
of winning), plus hold on to all the seats in which they're favored,
they would still wind up with only 208 seats, 10 short of the number
they need for a majority. Instead, Democrats will also have to win some
seats where Republican candidates are currently favored, and that
requires the national political environment in November to be more
favorable for Democrats than our model is currently expecting. On the
one hand, the task isn't that daunting for Democrats. Our model
[calculates that Democrats would be favored to keep the House if they
win the House popular vote]{.underline} --- or lose it by less than 0.7
percentage points --- [something that Democrats did in both 2018 and
2020.]{.underline} Moreover, **[Democrats are down by only about 2
points in our current average of generic-ballot polls]{.underline}**.
[Given the inherent error in polling]{.underline}, [and how much time
there is]{.underline} between now and November, **[it isn't hard to turn
a 2-point deficit in the polls into a 1-point win.]{.underline}**
However, in important ways, that 2-point deficit understates the degree
of trouble that Democrats are in. One reason is because many of those
polls are conducted among registered voters rather than likely voters,
and the electorate that turns out in November is likely to be more
Republican than the broader universe of all registered voters.
Historically, the patterns in midterm elections are that: 1) Republicans
turn out more than Democrats, and 2) voters for whichever party doesn't
control the presidency are more enthusiastic and turn out more. In 2018,
those factors canceled one another out. Democrats, not controlling the
presidency, were the more enthusiastic party, helping to neutralize the
Republicans' historical turnout advantage. This year, though, they both
work in the favor of Republicans. Thus, the model adjusts those
registered-voter polls based on its estimate of what likely-voter polls
would show, and when it does that, the Republicans' generic-ballot lead
is really more like 4 points than 2 points. I should note that this
adjustment is not rigid in the model. Although the model uses historical
turnout patterns as its baseline assumption, it will override that based
on polls. In other words, if polls come out showing Democrats holding
their own among likely voters --- such as because of increased
Democratic enthusiasm in the wake of Roe being overturned --- the model
will adjust to reflect that. Put another way, **[a very strong turnout
would give Democrats a fighting chance of keeping the
House]{.underline}**. But also, the generic ballot isn't the only input
that the model considers, and some of the other factors look worse for
Democrats than the generic ballot does. Based on the historical tendency
for the president's party to lose seats in the midterms and Biden's poor
approval rating, for instance, the situation is more likely to get worse
for Democrats than better. The model also evaluates factors such as
polling and fundraising data in individual races. Overall, the Deluxe
forecast expects Democrats to eventually lose the popular vote for the
House by closer to 6 points, about the margin that they lost it by in
2014. And it expects Republicans to wind up with 237 seats in an average
outcome, a gain of 24 seats from the 213 they had at the start of the
current Congress.2 Histogram of each party's seat count in scenarios
where it wins the House in our Deluxe model's 40,000 simulations, where
Republicans have an 80 percent chance of holding between 215 and 259
seats. As I mentioned, this analysis is based on the Deluxe version of
our model, which accounts for polling, "fundamentals" --- or factors
such as fundraising and incumbency --- and expert race ratings such as
those put out by the Cook Political Report. The Classic version of our
model, which leaves out the expert ratings --- sacrificing the
additional accuracy they add but sticking to purely quantitative factors
--- tells a similar story, with Democrats also having a 12 percent
chance of keeping the House. The Lite version of our model, meanwhile,
which tries to forecast as much as it can based on polls alone, does
paint a more optimistic picture for Democrats, giving them a 22 percent
chance of keeping the House. But that version leaves out a lot of useful
information, especially given that there isn't much polling in a number
of competitive House races. The Senate [Democratic hopes of keeping the
Senate are]{.underline} much more [viable]{.underline}, however. Part of
this, as I mentioned, is because they appear to have stronger candidates
in a handful of key races. Pennsylvania, for instance --- which is an
open seat after the retirement of Republican Sen. Pat Toomey --- is
ordinarily the sort of seat that you'd expect Republicans to win since
Pennsylvania is a purple state in a Republican year. However, the
Democratic candidate, Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, is ahead of Republican
Mehmet Oz, the doctor and TV personality, in every poll conducted so
far. The model, though, is trained to be a bit skeptical given the
fundamentals of the race, so it hedges against those polls and, at this
point, has determined that Pennsylvania is best thought of as a toss-up.
Still, that means Democrats have roughly a 50-50 chance of gaining a
GOP-held Senate seat, offsetting potential losses elsewhere. Indeed, our
forecast sees the overall Senate landscape to be about as competitive as
it gets. The Deluxe forecast literally has Senate control as a 50-50
tossup. The Classic and Lite forecasts show Democrats as very slight
favorites to keep the Senate, meanwhile, with a 59 and a 62 percent
chance, respectively. Ball-swarm (or bee-swarm) chart showing which
party wins control of the House in 100 sample outcomes from our Deluxe
model's 40,000 simulations, where Democrats have a 47 percent chance of
winning the chamber and Republicans have a 53 percent chance. Part of
this is because Senate terms last for six years, and so most of these
seats were last contested in 2016,3 a mediocre year for Democrats in
which they lost the popular vote for the House and also lost Senate
races in swing states such as Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Arizona. Of
the 35 Senate seats up for grabs in November, 21 are currently held by
Republicans. True, most of these are not competitive, but in addition to
their chances to gain a GOP-held seat in Pennsylvania, Democrats also
have credible chances in Wisconsin and North Carolina (and outside
chances in Ohio and Florida, although those are a stretch given how
GOP-leaning both states have become). Republicans don't have any
surefire pickups, meanwhile. Our model regards their best chances as
being in Georgia, but that race is rated as a toss-up. And the races in
Arizona and New Hampshire merely lean toward the Democratic incumbent,
meaning they are still highly plausible GOP pickup opportunities. Still,
the picture isn't as bad as you might expect for Democrats. **[If the
political environment really deteriorates for them, they'll be in
trouble, lose most of the competitive races and even blue states like
Colorado could come into play]{.underline}**. But if things are merely
pretty bad for Democrats instead of catastrophic, the outcome of the
Senate will remain uncertain enough that stronger candidates could make
the difference for them.

#### Roe turned the elections predictions on their heads\-- energized dems and flipped moderates while polarizing republican candidate's alienate republicans

GOP will make his midterm case for him,\" NBC News,
https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/pressures-mounting-biden-thinks-gop-will-make-midterm-case-rcna36514

Little is going President Joe Biden's way as the summer lull sets in
before the crush of midterm elections. Gas prices are up; his approval
rating is down. A conservative Supreme Court majority is hacking away at
his agenda by abolishing federal abortion rights and undermining
environmental protections meant to curb climate change. His own party is
losing patience, fearing that any chance of consequential change while
Democrats control Congress is vanishing. "There needs to be urgency and
action," said Rebecca Kirszner Katz, who was an aide to the late Senate
Democratic leader Harry Reid. "Folks have been saying since the day Joe
Biden was elected that we need to move fast. There are a lot of things
we need to get done for the American people." [Biden has been rolling
out plans to cope with the mounting crises. He has a three-part plan to
reduce inflation. Another plan to suspend the gas tax in hopes of
bringing prices down. Then there's his long-shot plan to enshrine
abortion rights into law by suspending the Senate filibuster rule
requiring 60-vote supermajoritie]{.underline}s. Inside the White House,
though, advisers grasp that what's required aren't just plans, but
votes. The 50-50 split in the Senate between the parties has proved an
insurmountable obstacle for Biden's grandest ambitions --- to expand the
social safety net in ways that insulate the most vulnerable Americans
from economic shocks. "He has to change course," said a Democratic
congressman, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of upsetting
the White House. "His numbers are in the toilet. Whatever he's doing is
not working." A perennial complaint from Biden's Democratic critics is
that he hasn't capitalized on the platform he commands as president.
"There's a benefit to having the president out there every day using his
executive power to show the country you're fighting for them," the
Democratic lawmaker said. "And it's almost like he's hiding. He has the
bully pulpit, and he's either hiding behind it or under it. I don't know
where he is." Allies say that Biden, along with others in the
administration, will take better advantage of their megaphone in the
run-up to the midterms, portraying Republicans as out of touch. Biden,
they said, is **[energized by the Roe v. Wade decision]{.underline}**,
which may be a prelude to future Supreme Court rulings rolling back
rights to same-sex marriage and contraception. Unpopular presidents tend
to fare poorly in midterm elections. [**But Biden-world sees an opening
to defy the historical trends, springing from some of the same setbacks
that have so angered the Democratic base.** Republicans are overreaching
in ways that will alienate voters]{.underline}, White House allies
contend. "I can tell you that on the street, what you hear is a
bubbling, seething cauldron of anger at the Republican Party for putting
in these antediluvian judges who think they can take us back to the 18th
century," said Jay Inslee, the Democratic governor of Washington state.
"My spidey sense and the polling indicate it's going to help people
decide not to vote for the red team." Biden and other administration
officials intend to draw a stark contrast between the parties in the
coming months in hopes of awakening voters to how their personal rights
will be imperiled if Republicans seize control of Congress. To the
extent that Biden can drive home the message that [the court's
conservative majority was built by former President Donald Trump and
Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, he can demonstrate the
enormous stakes in the upcoming elections]{.underline}. "You will see
them \[Biden administration officials\] having a sharper message as we
get close to the fall," one Biden ally said. "That message will revolve
around painting the Republican Party as extreme and doing things that
are actively hurting peoples' lives. Is there a strong enough message
now? Probably not. But they know that." Biden previewed the strategy
last week in a virtual meeting with Democratic governors. He pledged to
use the full weight of the federal government to prevent what he called
"extremist" governors who may try to block women from traveling out of
state to get an abortion. A Biden adviser pointed to former Vice
President Mike Pence's call for a national abortion ban --- something
that can only be stopped if Democrats have sufficient votes in Congress
to block it. That's [the sort of issue that can mobilize voters who
might otherwise be apathetic about coming out to vote]{.underline}.
Abortion "is much more motivating for Democratic-leaning voters than it
is for Republican-leaning voters," the Biden adviser said, speaking on
condition of anonymity to talk more freely. "A lot of that is due to the
fact that Republicans have sought this outcome for many years and they
just achieved it. But the [opposite effect is taking place with
Democrats and independents, who are deeply offended by this and who are
afraid about what it means for their lives]{.underline}." Most
[Democrats fret about a midterm wipeout, but recent polling shows
grounds for optimism]{.underline}. Bryan Bennett, a pollster for
Navigator Research, a coalition of progressive pollsters, noted that
something "weird" is happening in this political moment. Biden's
approval rating is hovering around 40%, which suggests that Republican
victories in the November midterms will be not so much a wave as a
"tsunami," he said. **[And yet in polls pitting generic Democrats
against Republicans in congressional races, Democrats perform better
than expected given the president's low standing]{.underline}**. Indeed,
**[since the Supreme Court reversed Roe v. Wade, three polls came out
showing Democrats leading Republicans by anywhere from 3 to 7 percentage
points]{.underline}**. **["It's a new election,"]{.underline}**
Democratic strategist Simon Rosenberg wrote in a blog. "The chances of
the anti-MAGA majority showing up again --- as it did in 2018 and 2020
--- have increased dramatically." And Republicans in some cases are
putting forward candidates whom mainstream voters may find unpalatable.
A video circulating on Twitter shows a recent debate among congressional
Republican candidates in Wyoming, where some of Rep. Liz Cheney's
challengers struggle to form a coherent sentence. "[People are going to
be stunned when they see some of the nominees they \[Republicans\] put
out there]{.underline}," said Joe Trippi, a longtime Democratic
strategist. Economics usually drive elections, though, and Republicans
are working hard to remind voters that Biden is presiding over a period
of \$5 a gallon of gas and rising prices across the board. The White
House describes inflation as a global problem for which Biden bears
little direct responsibility. Still, Biden was quick to claim credit a
year ago for low grocery prices. In the days before July 4, 2021, the
White House tweeted that the cost of a family barbecue had dropped. "Hot
dog, the Biden economic plan is working," the White House tweeted at the
time. This year, the cost of a cookout including hamburgers, potato
salad and ice cream was 17% higher, according to the American Farm
Bureau Federation. There was no White House tweet drawing attention to
that unhappy reality. The summer figures to be a tricky one for Biden.
Next week he will visit the Middle East for meetings in Israel and Saudi
Arabia. Normally, a foreign trip is a chance for the president to show
voters back home the respect he's accorded worldwide. He steps off of
Air Force One and onto red carpets. Troops line up for his inspection.
Bands play. Toasts are made. But Biden is already facing backlash over
the plan to stop in Saudi Arabia, having vowed during his 2020 campaign
to make the kingdom a "pariah" in part because of the killing of the
journalist Jamal Khashoggi. As for Israel, Biden will be meeting with a
government that is effectively leaderless, having dissolved its
parliament and scheduled its fifth election in the last four years. "I
don't envy Biden," Katz said. "There's a lot of pressure. But that's the
job."

[There are 10 potentially competitive Senate races this
year]{.underline}, according to the Cook Political Report, and
[Democrats need to win at least five of them to keep Senate control.
Democrats are favored in two of those 10 races]{.underline} (New
Hampshire and Colorado) and Cook rates another five (Arizona, Georgia,
Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin) as tossups. If Democrats keep the
Senate without the House, they still would not be able to pass
legislation without Republican support. But [Senate control nonetheless
matters. It would allow President Biden to appoint judges, Cabinet
secretaries and other top officials without any Republican support,
because only the Senate needs to confirm nominees.]{.underline} I'm
turning over the rest of today's lead item to Blake, who will preview
the campaign for Senate control. When asked to share their candid
thoughts about the Democrats' chances of hanging onto their House
majority in the coming election, party strategists often use words that
cannot be printed in a family newsletter. [But a brighter picture is
coming together for Democrats on the Senate side. There, Republicans are
assembling what one top strategist laughingly described as an "island of
misfit toys" --- a motley collection of candidates the Democratic Party
hopes to portray as out of the mainstream on policy, personally
compromised and too cozy with Donald Trump. These vulnerabilities have
led to a rough few weeks for Republican Senate candidates in several of
the most competitive races: Arizona: Blake Masters, a venture capitalist
who secured Trump's endorsement]{.underline} and is leading the polls in
the Republican primary, [has been criticized for saying that "Black
people, frankly" are responsible for most of the gun violence in the
U.S.]{.underline} Other Republicans have attacked him for past comments
supporting "unrestricted immigration." [Georgia: Herschel
Walker]{.underline}, the G.O.P. nominee facing Senator Raphael Warnock,
[acknowledged being the parent of three previously undisclosed children.
Walker regularly inveighs against absentee fathers. Pennsylvania: Dr.
Mehmet Oz]{.underline}, who lived in New Jersey before announcing his
Senate run, [risks looking inauthentic.]{.underline} Oz recently
misspelled the name of his new hometown on an official document.
[Nevada: Adam Laxalt]{.underline}, a former state attorney general,
[said at a pancake breakfast last month that "Roe v. Wade was always a
joke."]{.underline} That's an [unpopular stance in socially liberal
Nevada]{.underline}, where 63 percent of adults say abortion should be
mostly legal. [Wisconsin: Senator Ron Johnson made a cameo in the Jan. 6
hearings]{.underline} when it emerged that, on the day of the attack,
[he wanted to hand-deliver a fraudulent list of electors to former Vice
President Mike Pence.]{.underline} Republicans counter with some
politically potent arguments of their own, blaming Democrats for rising
prices and saying that they have veered too far left for mainstream
voters. In Pennsylvania, for instance, Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, the
Democratic Senate nominee, supports universal health care, federal
marijuana legalization and criminal justice reform. Republicans have
been combing through his record and his past comments to depict him as
similar to Bernie Sanders, the self-described Democratic socialist.
Candidate vs. candidate [One factor working in the Democrats' favor is
the fact that only a third of the Senate is up for re-election, and many
races are in states that favor Democrats.]{.underline} Another is the
fact that Senate races can be more distinct than House races, influenced
less by national trends and more by candidates' personalities[. The ad
budgets in Senate races can reach into the hundreds of millions of
dollars, giving candidates a chance to define themselves and their
opponents.]{.underline} Democrats are leaning heavily on
personality-driven campaigns, promoting Senator Mark Kelly in Arizona as
a moderate, friendly former astronaut and Senator Catherine Cortez Masto
of Nevada as a fighter for abortion rights, retail workers and families.
["Senate campaigns are candidate-versus-candidate battles,"]{.underline}
said David Bergstein, a spokesman for the Democrats' Senate campaign
arm. "[And while Democratic incumbents and candidates have developed
their own brands, Republicans have put forward deeply, deeply flawed
candidates."]{.underline} Bergstein isn't objective, but that analysis
has some truth to it. There are about four months until Election Day, an
eternity in modern American politics. [As we've seen from the Supreme
Court's abortion ruling and from the explosive allegations that emerged
in the latest testimony against Trump, the political environment can
shift quickly. If the election were held today, polls suggests that
Democrats would be narrowly favored to retain Senate
control.]{.underline} Republican elites are also terrified that voters
might nominate Eric Greitens, the scandal-ridden former governor, for
Missouri's open Senate seat, jeopardizing a seat that would otherwise be
safe. [But the election, of course, is not being held today, and polls
are fallible, as we saw in 2020. So there's still a great deal of
uncertainty about the outcome.]{.underline} Biden's approval rating
remains low, and inflation is the top issue on voters' minds --- not the
foibles of individual candidates. [For now, Democrats are pretty pleased
with themselves for making lemonade out of a decidedly sour political
environment.]{.underline}

https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-republicans-are-favored-to-win-the-house-but-not-the-senate/

[Democratic hopes of keeping the Senate are much more
viable]{.underline}, however. Part of this, as I mentioned, is because
[they appear to have stronger candidates in a handful of key
races]{.underline}. Pennsylvania, for instance --- which is an open seat
after the retirement of Republican Sen. Pat Toomey --- is ordinarily the
sort of seat that you'd expect Republicans to win since Pennsylvania is
a purple state in a Republican year. However, the Democratic candidate,
Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, is ahead of Republican Mehmet Oz, the doctor
and TV personality, in every poll conducted so far. [The model, though,
is trained to be a bit skeptical given the fundamentals of the race, so
it hedges against those polls and, at this point, has determined that
Pennsylvania is best thought of as a toss-up. Still, that means
Democrats have roughly a 50-50 chance of gaining a GOP-held Senate seat,
offsetting potential losses elsewhere.]{.underline} Indeed, our forecast
sees the overall Senate landscape to be about as competitive as it
gets[. The Deluxe forecast literally has Senate control as a 50-50
tossup. The Classic and Lite forecasts show Democrats as very slight
favorites to keep the Senate, meanwhile, with a 59 and a 62 percent
chance, respectively.]{.underline} Ball-swarm (or bee-swarm) chart
showing which party wins control of the House in 100 sample outcomes
from our Deluxe model's 40,000 simulations, where Democrats have a 47
percent chance of winning the chamber and Republicans have a 53 percent
chance. [Part of this is because Senate terms last for six years, and so
most of these seats were last contested in 2016,3 a mediocre year for
Democrats]{.underline} in which they lost the popular vote for the House
and also lost Senate races in swing states such as Pennsylvania,
Wisconsin and Arizona. Of the 35 Senate seats up for grabs in November,
21 are currently held by Republicans. True, most of these are not
competitive, but in addition to their chances to gain a GOP-held seat in
Pennsylvania, Democrats also have credible chances in Wisconsin and
North Carolina (and outside chances in Ohio and Florida, although those
are a stretch given how GOP-leaning both states have become).
[Republicans don't have any surefire pickups, meanwhile. Our model
regards their best chances as being in Georgia, but that race is rated
as a toss-up. And the races in Arizona and New Hampshire merely lean
toward the Democratic incumbent]{.underline}, meaning they are still
highly plausible GOP pickup opportunities. [Still, the picture isn't as
bad as you might expect for Democrats]{.underline}. If the political
environment really deteriorates for them, they'll be in trouble, lose
most of the competitive races and even blue states like Colorado could
come into play. But if things are merely pretty bad for Democrats
instead of catastrophic, the outcome of the Senate will remain uncertain
enough that stronger candidates could make the difference for them.

On Nov. 8, 2022, [the American people will make a decision that will
change the course of history]{.underline}, send shock waves across the
globe, and be written about by historians a century from now. **[It
may]{.underline}** literally **[be the most important midterm election
in a century]{.underline}**. Here's why:

Today [democracy is fighting back fiercely against attacks by foreign
dictators abroad]{.underline} [and Republican partisans at home who
still try to reverse the 2020 election]{.underline}, elect state
Republicans who would corrupt the 2024 election, and practice aggressive
voter suppression reminiscent of the dark days of segregation.

It is often suggested, in my view incorrectly, [that]{.underline}
because President Biden's favorable numbers are low, [Democrats are
doomed to defeat in the midterms]{.underline}. **[This results from a
misunderstanding of the political situation]{.underline}** today.

If we review the RealClearPolitics 10 most recent 2022 generic
congressional vote polls as of yesterday morning, Democrats were leading
in five, Republicans in four, and the other was tied.

How can this be? If we review the RealClearPolitics favorable ratings of
political leaders, as of yesterday morning, Biden's rating was 43.6
percent, House Minority Leader [Kevin
McCarthy](https://thehill.com/people/kevin-mccarthy/) (R-Calif.) was
much lower, at 28 percent, and Senate Minority Leader [Mitch
McConnell](https://thehill.com/people/mitch-mcconnell/) (R-Ky.) was even
lower, at 26.3 percent!

**[Voters are not dissatisfied with Biden, they are dissatisfied with
ALL leaders of BOTH parties]{.underline}** in Washington, with Biden's
approval significantly higher than McCarthy's or McConnell's!

Given this season of discontent in our democracy, with more than a 90
percent probability, on the morning of Nov. 9[, the nation and world
will wake up to one of two potential midterm outcomes.]{.underline}

[The first possibility is that Republicans gain control of the House,
the Senate or both. This result would be armageddon for the]{.underline}
[[Biden]{.underline}](https://thehill.com/people/biden/)
[presidency]{.underline}. The legislative branch would be unable to pass
any major proposal from President Biden or Democrats in Congress.
Congressional Republicans would be unable to enact any legislation
without President Biden's signature.

In this scenario, a [Republican House or Senate would degenerate into
little more than permanent partisan Republican investigations of
Democrats]{.underline} and partisan Republican gridlock in Washington
--- **[provoking widespread anger and rage from a majority of Americans,
while Republicans compete with each other to be more
extreme]{.underline}**, in the party of Trump, not Lincoln.

[The second possibility]{.underline}, which is less likely than I wish
but more likely than most pundits believe, [is that Democrats retain
control of the Senate and House, and gain one or two Senate
seats.]{.underline}

In this scenario, [Biden and Democrats would be able to
enact]{.underline} a substantial program of economic, health care,
crime, climate change and voting rights [legislation]{.underline}, which
a majority of Americans would applaud.

Let's be clear, blunt and honest. **[Biden and Democrats do not control
a 50-50 Senate in which one or two Democratic senators alone can
overrule the Democratic president]{.underline}**, 48 Democratic
senators, and all Democratic House members before they host fundraisers
with grateful Republican donors and special interests.

**[With only one or two more Democratic senators, Democrats and
democracy would flourish!]{.underline}**

from the 2022 election midpoint,\" POLITICO,

Donald Trump's legacy was on trial in Washington on Tuesday. But it was
his future as the leader of the Republican Party that was being tested
elsewhere in the country in the first primaries of the post-Roe v. Wade
world. More than half the states have now held primaries, and we're
beginning to see just how important Trump may be to the GOP --- and how
important Roe may be to the Democrats. They are desperate to stave off
disaster in November, and from the Democrats' messaging on Roe to their
interventions in Republican primaries in Colorado and Illinois on
Tuesday, the latest big round of multi-state primaries offered the first
test of Democrats' new outlook on the midterms. **[As Trump labors to
hold onto the GOP]{.underline}** and Democrats labor to limit their
losses in the midterms, here are five takeaways from a big primary night
--- and a midterm report card on the state of the race: Trump is
**[worse off than ever]{.underline}** Donald Trump's preferred candidate
in a contested House race, Rep. Mary Miller, won her member-on-member
primary in Illinois on Tuesday. But that's not likely to be the talk of
the town, not [after the testimony heard Tuesday about his culpability
in the riot at the Capitol]{.underline} on Jan. 6. Even on good nights
for the former president these days, he keeps taking hits. Halfway
through the midterms, Trump's candidates have won competitive primaries
in Ohio and Pennsylvania, among other states. And there have been scores
of Republicans who faced minimal or no opposition who Trump endorsed to
pad his resume. By the end of the primaries, he'll be crowing about his
designed-to-be-favorable scorecard in the midterms. But there's a reason
that every time one of his endorsed candidates wins, Republicans point
back to Trump's collapse in Georgia, or to polls like the one in New
Hampshire last week that had Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis statistically
tied with Trump among Republican primary voters in the
first-in-the-nation primary state. The primaries have been mixed for
Trump. He may not be beaten, but he's beatable --- and that wasn't so
clear when the primary season began. What's more, while primaries drag
on around the country, **[Trump is getting mauled in
Washington]{.underline}**, where the Jan. 6 committee [hearings appear
to be having at least some effect.]{.underline} [Fifty-eight percent of
Americans now think Trump should be prosecuted for his role in
the]{.underline} riot at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, according to a
recent ABC News/Ipsos poll, up slightly from previous measures. And that
was before Tuesday's jaw-dropping testimony about Trump's behavior on
Jan. 6. Between Trump's mixed midterm record, DeSantis's rise and the
testimony on Tuesday, said John Thomas, a Republican strategist, [the
party is "starting to see a crack here" in Trump's grip on the
party]{.underline}. Dick Wadhams, a former Colorado Republican Party
chair and longtime party strategist, said, "There are a lot of signs the
party is starting to move ever so slightly away from Trump." SCOTUS is
the new Trump The testimony on Tuesday --- that Trump was told
supporters in Washington on Jan. 6 were armed --- gave Democrats yet
another Trump-related outrage to pin on the GOP. But [electorally, the
effectiveness of yoking Republican candidates to Trump has always been
in question.]{.underline} It didn't work for Terry McAuliffe in last
year's gubernatorial race in Virginia. It hasn't moved polling at all
this year. And by November, Trump will have been out of office for
nearly two years. The better foil for Democrats is almost certain to be
the Supreme Court's overturning on Friday of Roe v. Wade. And Democrats
know it. Judging by Tuesday's primaries, the party in power in
Washington will be running against the court in the fall. The messaging
began even before the decision came down. Dems prepare for showdown in
state legislatures post-Roe \| The Midterm View The Democratic
Legislative Campaign Committee has now become one of the most important
arms of the Democratic party post-Roe. Eugene Daniels talks to Jessica
Post, of the DLCC on how abortion rights will be used in the 2022
midterm elections. Democratic Rep. Sean Casten, who beat Rep. Marie
Newman in a member-on-member primary in a Chicago-based district, ran
ads pledging to defend abortion rights from "extreme Republicans and
right-wing judges." (Newman had put the matter to voters in personal
terms, describing her own decision, at 19, to have an abortion.) In the
race to fill the seat now held by retiring Rep. Bobby Rush, an outside
group promoting Karin Norington-Reaves aired TV spots with
black-and-white images of conservative justices, saying Norington-Reaves
would "fight against the tyranny of the good old boys." Norington-Reaves
was running behind in that primary late Tuesday. But the ad will likely
endure. It's the kind of framing an incumbent party uses when it needs
to run against something -- and Democrats aren't pleasing voters enough
in Washington to be running on what they've done. "You can run against
the Supreme Court," said Craig Hughes, a Democratic strategist in
Colorado. "I do think Roe will absolutely matter." Alexandria
Ocasio-Cortez speaks to abortion-rights activists in front of the U.S.
Supreme Court after the Court announced a ruling in the Dobbs v Jackson
Women\'s Health Organization case on June 24, 2022, in Washington, DC.
ROE V. WADE OVERTURNED There are reasons to think Hughes may be right
--- not enough to keep Democrats from losing the House, probably, but at
least enough to limit their losses. The ruling was unpopular, and in
three polls released since the Roe decision, the generic ballot has
shifted in Democrats' favor --- with voters favoring Democratic
candidates over Republicans in November by as much as 7 percentage
points. "Hoping it's the start of a trend," said Kelly Dietrich, a
former Democratic fundraiser who is based in Illinois and founded the
National Democratic Training Committee, which trains candidates across
the country. "We'll see." Democratic voters aren't turning out --- yet
Primary turnout has historically been a poor indicator of general
election turnout, but in a year in which Democrats are desperate for
younger, lower-propensity voters to find their way to the polls, the
early turnout numbers in Illinois and New York on Tuesday were another
bad sign. In Illinois, early vote totals were lagging 2018 totals both
statewide and in Chicago, the kind of big, Democratic city where an
outpouring of voters due to Roe, if one were to come, would have been
expected. It was the same story in New York, where turnout was expected
to be lackluster. Democrats may be furious about Trump's behavior on
Jan. 6 or about the Supreme Court's behavior last week. But it's not
translating into voting --- at least not yet. "Nobody's turning out,"
said one Democratic strategist in Illinois who requested anonymity to
speak freely. "I mean nobody. Nobody is voting ... The early vote
numbers are abysmally bad." The strategist said voters are "pissed off"
but that between Roe and voting, "I don't think people are connecting
the dots." Democrats came into the midterm election cycle facing
historic headwinds, widely expected to lose the House in November. And
things haven't been going their way since. President Joe Biden's public
approval rating has dropped below 40 percent. Inflation does not appear
to be going anywhere, and a recession may be near. There is still a path
for Democrats to blunt Republicans' gains. [If Democrats can prosecute
the case on Roe effectively, their voters could have reason to turn out
in November]{.underline}. And the Jan. 6 committee may get what James
Carville, the former Bill Clinton strategist, called a "head of steam."
It certainly looked like it might on Tuesday. "The path is not
impossible," Carville said. Still, early voting in the general election
isn't far off. "**[If this needle doesn't move by the end of
July]{.underline}**," Carville said, "**[it's probably not going to
move.]{.underline}**" Democrats' savvy, sad 'choose your own adventure'
It tells you everything you need to know about how bad things are for
Democrats this year that they spent heavily in Illinois and Colorado on
Republicans, meddling in the opposition's primaries in a bid to
guarantee win-able elections in the fall. Joe Biden carried those states
by about 17 percentage points and 14 percentage points, respectively, in
2020. They aren't exactly states a confident party would expect to swing
to the GOP. Yet in a difficult midterm year, even Democrats acknowledge
the map for Republicans could expand. Call the spending ahead of
Tuesday's primaries an insurance policy. In Illinois, where Democrats
sought to tear down Richard Irvin in the gubernatorial primary, the
intervention worked, elevating a Republican state senator, Darren
Bailey, who is widely viewed as less electable than Irvin in the fall.

wife Cindy Stortzum. Republican gubernatorial candidate Darren Bailey,

questions after winning the Republican primary Tuesday, June 28, 2022,

strategy was a bust. Outside groups poured millions of dollars down the
drain in an effort to keep businessman Joe O'Dea from winning the
Republican U.S. Senate nomination, and he won, anyway. So did
Republicans running in two other Colorado races Democrats tried
unsuccessfully to sway. It's hard to argue with the politics of
Democrats trying to set up the best race they can. Still, as one
Colorado-based Democratic strategist put it, "This
choose-your-own-adventure thing is a little bit of risk-reward." Money
is always scarce in general elections, and Democrats may be groaning
about the Colorado investment in November. The 'Big Lie' takes a hit It
was a big night for pro-democracy Republicans in Colorado, where a
threesome of election deniers appeared headed to defeat. Ron Hanks, a
Colorado state representative who was in Washington on Jan. 6, 2021 and
maintains, falsely, that Trump won, lost to O'Dea, a more moderate
Republican, in the U.S. Senate primary. Tina Peters, a county clerk who
was indicted on charges she was part of voting system technology breach
scheme, went down in her primary for secretary of state, as did Greg
Lopez, who also believes Trump won, in the gubernatorial race. Pair
those with the big night election defenders had in Georgia's
gubernatorial and secretary of state races last month, and the Big Lie
is taking some hits. But it's nowhere near close to fading out of the
GOP. In Illinois, Miller, who campaigned with Trump recently, won
despite voting against certifying the 2020 election, and hitting her
opponent, Rep. Rodney Davis, for his votes to certify Biden's election.
That's on top of the dozens of election deniers who have already won
primaries in states across the country, many of them relatively
young-for-politics Republicans who, win or lose, will maintain a
presence in the party for years. There's Doug Mastriano, the far-right
election conspiracy pusher who won the Republican primary for governor
of Pennsylvania. In Nevada, Republican Jim Marchant, a leader of a
circle of MAGA-aligned election deniers running to become secretaries of
state, easily won his primary earlier this month. The Michigan
Republican Party's nominee for state attorney general, Matthew DePerno,
is a Kalamazoo lawyer who was a major figure in Trump's failed bid to
overturn the election in Michigan. More are likely to be nominated in
the second half of the year. Right after a break in the multi-state
primaries, in August, comes Arizona, where Kari Lake, the former TV
anchor who insists Trump carried the state, is among leading candidates
for governor. Also on the ballot in that state: state Rep. Mark Finchem,
one of the chief proponents of his state's farcical ballot review, is
running for secretary of state. Regardless of Trump's fortunes, large
majorities of Republicans still believe his lie that the election was
rigged. If the primaries have taught us anything, it's that that lie may
outlast him. "I think a lot of Americans have just lost faith in
American institutions," said Sean Walsh, a Republican strategist who
worked in the Reagan and George H.W. Bush White Houses. For many
Republicans, he said, "I think the lack of faith in the electoral system
does outlast Trump. Sadly, I think it does."

[Here are some vulnerable Republicans.]{.underline} GOVERNORS: [Brian
Kemp (Georgia), Ron DeSantis (Florida), and Greg Abbott (Texas) These
Republican governors signed abortion bans that are unpopular in their
states.]{.underline} Just this week[, a Quinnipiac poll showed the
Georgia gubernatorial race between incumbent Republican Brian Kemp and
former House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams in a dead heat, with Abrams
closing a two-point gap since January]{.underline}. However, a
smattering of prior polls from other outfits suggests that Kemp may
still hold a slight lead. [Kemp signed a 2019 law effectively banning
abortion after six weeks of pregnancy]{.underline}, with exceptions for
risking the mother's death, "medically futile" pregnancies, and---if a
police report is filed---rape and incest. The law has not been enacted
because of a federal court injunction, but now that Roe is gone, the
injunction should be soon lifted. Most Georgians won't celebrate. A
January Atlanta Journal-Constitution poll found that [54 percent of
Georgia voters opposed the law, and 68 percent did not want Roe
overturned.]{.underline} The Democratic gubernatorial nominee in Texas,
former Representative Beto O'Rourke, might face a tougher battle as he
trails Governor Gregg Abbott by five points in the most recent
Quinnipiac poll and eight points in the most recent CBS/YouGov poll. But
regarding abortion policy[, Quinnipiac found that Texas voters preferred
O'Rourke over Abbott by two points. And 59 percent of Texans in the
CBS/YouGov poll disapprove of Abbott's handling of
abortion]{.underline}. (The Quinnipiac poll was taken before, and the
CBS/YouGov poll was partially taken before, the Dobbs ruling.) Perhaps
O'Rourke can widen that margin. [Abbott has already enacted a six-week
abortion ban and a ban on most distribution of abortion
pills]{.underline}. He also signed a trigger law, which will soon
detonate, banning all abortions except to save the mother's life, with a
maximum sentence of 99 years for abortion providers. Yet, according to
the June Quinnipiac poll, [59 percent of Texas voters support legal
abortion in all or most cases. A December Spectrum News/Ipsos poll found
that 55 percent opposed the six-week ban.]{.underline} As I wrote last
month, [Abbott's unpopular abortion position hadn't weakened his overall
standing, because the impact of his policies hadn't been widely
felt.]{.underline} Most Texans seeking abortions were still getting
them, either by illegally obtaining pills or by crossing state lines.
[But with an even more draconian law about to go into effect and
disappearing abortion access in three of its four neighboring states,
the loss of reproductive freedom may soon be more painfully noticeable.
In Florida, DeSantis signed a law in April banning abortion after 15
weeks of pregnancy]{.underline}, a rare example of the right-wing
firebrand not going to the farthest possible extreme. He is being
pressured by the right to go further in the wake of Dobbs, even though
most Florida voters didn't want him to go as far as he did. [In a
February poll from the University of North Florida, 57 percent opposed
the 15-week ban, which went up to 62 percent when informed that the
legislation had no exceptions for rape and incest. Florida's support for
abortion rights is long-standing]{.underline}, and the state
constitution includes a right to privacy that has been interpreted by
state courts to cover reproductive freedom. A 2012 attempt to supersede
court rulings with an anti-abortion ballot initiative failed, with 55
percent of the electorate voting against it. In fact, on June 30, a
county circuit judge placed a temporary injunction on the 15-week ban
because it runs afoul of the state constitution. But the Florida Supreme
Court is stocked with Republican appointees---who serve six-year
terms---and may follow the U.S. Supreme Court's example, disregard
precedent, and overrule the lower court[. If it upholds the ban, that
will give the Democratic nominee---to be chosen in an August
primary---an even stronger argument for replacing DeSantis.]{.underline}
Other [2022 governor's races to keep an eye on: Arizona, Iowa, Ohio,
South Carolina, and South Dakota]{.underline}: According to the data
from Grumbach and Warshaw[, these states have pro-choice
majorities]{.underline}. (South Dakota just barely, though its voters in
2006 and 2008 defeated proposed abortion bans in referenda.) Yet Ohio's
Mike DeWine, Iowa's Kim Reynolds, and South Carolina's Henry McMaster
all signed effective six-week bans (injunctions have been lifted in Ohio
and South Carolina). South Dakota's 2005 trigger law lacks rape and
incest exceptions---and defies the voters' will in subsequent referenda.
Nevertheless, it's kicking in with Governor Kristi Noem's enthusiastic
support. Also, in Arizona, where the incumbent Republican is not running
for reelection, a 1901 law banning abortions enacted when Arizona was a
territory might be resurrected. The four incumbents are viewed as having
easy paths to reelection in November; The Cook Report with Amy Walter
rates McMaster, Noem, and Reynolds as "Solid," with DeWine as "Likely."
[But it's worth watching to see if their unpopular abortion stances give
their Democratic challengers a fresh foothold.]{.underline}

[Democrats]{.underline} hope to [make November's midterm elections a

law.]{.underline} What's more, polls showed **[a rising number of voters
listing abortion as their top midterm issue]{.underline}** after news of
Roe's imminent demise leaked in the form of a draft court opinion
published by Politico. Unfortunately, their current plan is almost sure
to fail. After the Democrats came up with just 49 votes to bring a
Roe-protecting bill before the Senate on May 11, they promised to keep
fighting and, in the words of Senator Amy Klobuchar, "take that fight
right to the ballot box" in November. But you can't make an election
into a referendum on an issue if you can't point to anything winning the
election would accomplish. To make the 2022 elections a referendum on
Roe, [Democrats]{.underline} have to [put protecting Roe and abortion
rights on the table]{.underline}. Here's one way to do that: get clear
public commitments from every Senate Democrat (and candidate for Senate)
not only to vote for the Roe bill in January 2023 but also to change the
filibuster rules to ensure that a majority vote would actually pass the
bill and send it to the White House for the president's signature. At
present, there are likely 48 Senate Democrats who can make that pledge.
Senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema are dead set against any changes
to the filibuster --- a fact you likely know because most of President
Biden's agenda has been bottled up behind their refusal for the past
year. Some claim that Senators Manchin and Sinema are just taking the
public heat for a number of other Senate Democrats who are also
unwilling to change the filibuster rules. That's highly unlikely. But if
any do have misgivings, that's why the public commitments are so
important. Getting a list of holdouts down to a publicly named handful
is the first step to persuading them to fall in line. If my math is
right and there are 48 Senate Democrats ready to make that pledge, they
**[need two additional Democratic senators in the next
Congress]{.underline}**. And that is the party's message that makes the
2022 midterms a referendum on Roe: "Give us the House and two more
senators, and we will make Roe law in January 2023." The End of Roe v.
Wade Commentary by Times Opinion writers and columnists on the Supreme
Court's decision to end ​​the constitutional right to abortion. Michelle
Goldberg: "The end of Roe v. Wade was foreseen, but in wide swaths of
the country, it has still created wrenching and potentially tragic
uncertainties." Spencer Bokat-Lindell: "What exactly does it mean for
the Supreme Court to experience a crisis of legitimacy, and is it really
in one?" Bonnie Kristian, journalist: "For many backers of former
President Donald Trump, Friday's Supreme Court decision was a
long-awaited vindication." It might also mark the end of his political
career. Erika Bachiochi, legal scholar: "It is precisely the unborn
child's state of existential dependence upon its mother, not its
autonomy, that makes it especially entitled to care, nurture and legal
protection." **[No ambiguity, no haggling, no living in Senator
Manchin's head for a year]{.underline}**. You give us this, and we'll
give you that. That [tells voters exactly what will be delivered with a
Democratic win]{.underline}. It also defines what constitutes a win:
control of the House and two more Senate seats. Dig deeper into the
moment. Special offer: Subscribe for \$1 a week. The campaign message is
clear: If you want to protect Roe, give us those majorities. If this is
your passion, here's where to channel that passion. These are the Senate
seats we need to hold (in New Hampshire, Arizona, Georgia and Nevada)
and here are the ones we need to win (in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and
possibly in Ohio, Florida and North Carolina). With those commitments in
hand, one question should be on the lips of every Democratic candidate.
Will you make **[a firm commitment to never vote for a federal law
banning abortion nationwide?]{.underline}** **[Few, if any, Republicans
would be able to make that pledge]{.underline}**. And their evasions
wouldn't just make them look ridiculous; that would put squarely on the
table [the very real threat that Republicans would enact a nationwide
abortion ban as soon as January 2025]{.underline}. That could prove
enough to win Senate races in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Ohio. In a
way, though, this strategy isn't so much about winning the 2022 midterms
or even making Roe into a federal law, although it's the best way to
accomplish both. It's just an example of how you win elections**[.
Effective campaigns are built on connecting the intense beliefs of the
electorate]{.underline}** --- their hopes and fears --- **[directly to
the hard mechanics of political power]{.underline}**. You've got to
connect those wires. If you were testing some new electrical
contraption, that's the first thing you'd do: make sure the energy
supply is wired to the engine that makes it run. This is no different.
Without tying a specific electoral result to a clear commitment to a
specific legislative action after the elections, you're not connecting
those wires. What Democrats would be proposing is a classic small-c
conservative solution in the best sense of the word. Codifying Roe would
preserve the set of rights and protections that the vast majority of
Americans have lived their entire adult lives with and that the
overwhelming majority of Americans do not want to change. The threat
that the court will strike down such a law is real but overstated. And
in any case, refusing to act because of what opponents might do is the
definition of political paralysis. So how do Democrats get from here to
there? They likely can't rely on the party's leaders, at least not at
first. But they're not essential. It's really up to voters and activists
and particularly committed members of Congress. Probably half the
Democrats in the Senate would be happy to sign on this dotted line by
the end of the day. Those who are up for re-election, even in safe
races, will come around quickly. Some senators may resist at first. And
that wouldn't be surprising. Politicians seldom see any advantage to
committing themselves in advance or reducing their room for maneuver.
It's always safer to keep your options open and be as general as
possible until the final moment. That's why assembling a clear public
list of commitments is critical. Once the list gets down to a handful of
hesitaters, the pressure from Democrats nationwide, focused on those
members, will be overwhelming. If there are real holdouts, they'll fold
in short order. You don't need to wait on Nancy Pelosi or Chuck Schumer
or President Biden. You can get the ball rolling by calling up your
Democratic senator today.

[With the Supreme Court ruling likely to come next year --- less than
six months before midterm elections that will determine control of
Congress and the future of President Biden's agenda --- the court's
expanded conservative majority has injected new volatility into an
already turbulent political atmosphere, leaving both parties to game out
the potential consequences. R]{.underline}epublicans had already shown
that they intended to take aim at Democrats over social issues, and
[abortion will only amplify the culture wars]{.underline}. Nearly all
agree that the latest fight over Roe, which has been building for years,
is certain to have significant political repercussions. [Conservative
voters are traditionally more energized than liberals about the abortion
debate, and for many of them it has been the single issue spurring voter
turnout.]{.underline} But [Democrats, likely to be on the defensive
given their current hold on the White House and Congress, say a ruling
broadly restricting abortion rights by a court whose ideological makeup
has been altered by three Trump-era appointees could backfire on
Republicans and galvanize women]{.underline}. "[Outlawing Roe would
create a backlash that would have critical unintended consequences for
those who would like to repeal it]{.underline}," said Senator Jeanne
Shaheen, Democrat of New Hampshire and a leading voice in Congress for
abortion rights. "The [women of the country would be very upset,
particularly young women, that there would be such a deliberate effort
to limit women's access to reproductive choices]{.underline}." Those on
the right, already anticipating a favorable ruling given the
conservative tilt of the 6-3 court, say [they expect liberals to seize
on the issue to try to "scare" voters. But they believe they can make a
case for "reasonable" abortion limits.]{.underline} "This is clearly
going to invigorate people on both sides of the debate, but **[this is a
winning issue for pro-life candidates]{.underline}**," said Mallory
Quigley, a spokeswoman for the Susan B. Anthony List, a conservative
nonprofit. She said she did not expect conservative voting enthusiasm to
ebb if the right triumphed at the Supreme Court, an outcome that would
bring to fruition years of emphasis on electing anti-abortion lawmakers
at the federal and state levels and working aggressively to confirm
conservative judges. "What happened on Monday is evidence that elections
have consequences," Ms. Quigley said, referring to the Supreme Court's
decision to take a case about a Mississippi law that seeks to ban most
abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy --- about two months earlier than
Roe and subsequent decisions allow. [The Supreme Court action may have
political ramifications before next year.]{.underline} The case is
likely to be argued weeks before Virginia voters head to the polls in
November to elect a new governor in a race often seen as a midterm
bellwether. [Terry McAuliffe, a former governor and most likely the
Democratic nominee, is eager for another political battle over abortion
rights,]{.underline} rattling off his record protecting clinics in the
state and vetoing legislation that would impose restrictions.. "[This is
going to be a huge motivator," he said in an interview. "In 2013, I
promised women I would be a brick wall to protect their rights. And I
will be a brick wall again."]{.underline} Senator Rick Scott of Florida,
the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, downplayed
the potential effect of the court ruling, though he said that as an
abortion opponent he welcomed the court taking up the case. But Mr.
Scott said he believed voters would be more persuaded by what he
described as the Biden administration's failings on issues such as
immigration, the economy, taxes, inflation and more. While the lines
have always been starkly drawn on abortion into the pro and anti camps,
public opinion has proved more nuanced, with a clear majority backing
Roe but majorities also favoring some limits. H[ow the Supreme Court
comes down on the fine points of abortion law **could determine how the
issue plays in the elections**. "Considering the decision will likely be
made five months ahead of the election, and depending on the decision
itself,]{.underline} it's too early to measure its ultimate impact on
the midterms," said Nathan Gonzales, the editor of the nonpartisan
Inside Elections. Mr. Gonzales said it could conceivably energize
Republicans but also pay benefits for Democrats --- a view shared by
others. [President Donald J. Trump helped inspire record turnout last
year from Democratic voters, who were eager to reject his
administration]{.underline}. With Mr. Trump no longer on the ballot,
[many Democrats say the Supreme Court case could provide crucial midterm
motivation, particularly for suburban women in swing districts who were
instrumental in Democratic wins last year. K]{.underline}atie Paris, the
founder of Red, Wine and Blue, a group focused on organizing suburban
female voters for Democrats across the country, said the Supreme Court
news immediately touched off alarm on the Facebook groups and other
social media channels run by her organization. "When the news came out
that this was going to be taken up, it was like, 'Everybody get ready.
This is real,'" she said. "[We know what this court could do, and if
they do it, the **backlash will be severe**."]{.underline} Tresa Undem,
a pollster who specializes in surveys on gender issues, said that
abortion rights would continue to be an effective cause for Democrats
because voters link it to larger concerns about power and control that
motivated female voters during the Trump administration. "Democrats and
independents have felt a loss of control and power from people at the
top," said Ms. Undem, who has conducted polling for several abortion
rights organizations. "[Now you have six individuals who are going to
make these decisions about your body in this personal area that will
affect the rest of your life." Mr. Bennet said he could not predict the
political implications of the court taking on abortion, but he wanted to
alert his supporters that something of consequence was at
hand]{.underline}. "There are a lot of people who have worked for a long
time to overturn Roe v. Wade, and that is what is at stake," he said. "I
think people needed to hear that in the wake of the Supreme Court taking
this case from Mississippi."

#### **Roe v. Wade has inflamed voters and urged reevaluation of parties -- will cause a dem win**

https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/08/opinion/democrats-abortion-midterms.html\]//RA

When it comes to abortion rights, the [Democrats need to lean into the
politics of fear]{.underline}.

They face a base that feels betrayed and a set of wealthy, moderate
voters in purple states who [may not realize that their own rights are
also on the
line.](https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/poll-finding/kff-health-tracking-poll-views-knowledge-abortion-2022/) Democrats
need both of these groups to stave off defeat in the fall, and fear can
drive them to the polls. What should the Democrats tell them to be
afraid of? A national abortion ban.

America after [the fall of Roe v. Wade might feel like]{.underline}
we're living in the [worst-case scenario]{.underline}, **[but anyone who
values reproductive freedom has reason to panic about what
could]{.underline}** **[happen if Republicans take back
power]{.underline}** in Washington. G.O.P. Congress members have already
introduced bills that would criminalize abortion in various ways. They
are only more emboldened now.

Last month, former Vice President [Mike Pence called for a national
abortion ban]{.underline}. More to the point, Senator Mitch McConnell,
the minority leader, has called it "possible." Recently, he hedged the
prediction by stating an obvious fact: "Neither side on this issue has
had 60" votes to pass such a ban. Is that a phrase you feel comfortable
hanging your future on?

Plenty of [progressive voters]{.underline} don't need to be made aware
of the danger. They [are already terrified for the future]{.underline}.
**[But everyone should be, not just those who might want or need an
abortion in the future.]{.underline}** The conservative legal theories
(and the conservative jurists) that brought down Roe threaten marriage
equality, privacy in the bedroom, even contraception. [A law banning
abortion by recognizing fetuses as humans with constitutional rights
could criminalize in vitro fertilization. The life-or-death pregnancy
scenarios now playing out in red states could be repeated right next
door, no matter where you live.]{.underline}

To meet the urgency of the moment and save their razor-thin and often
nonexistent hold on the Senate, **[Democrats must talk about that
future, giving voters across the country, in every state, a reason to
vote]{.underline}**. Lives are on the line. At the same time, Democratic
leaders have to understand that the politics of fear can run both ways.

The party needs to scare voters and show that they, too, are scared:
scared of the voters themselves. Democratic politicians watched
Republicans roll back abortion rights for decades --- and when Roe fell,
they had no plan. Now, [they need to demonstrate that they are willing
to put themselves at the mercy of those they failed]{.underline} ---
making specific promises and letting the voters know that if they fail
again, it will be more than a fund-raising opportunity. It will be a
reckoning.

Politicians have never shied away from making campaign promises, but the
Republicans are better at creating the circumstances for voters to exact
revenge. Grover Norquist's "Taxpayer Protection Pledge" held sway over
hundreds of Republican candidates for over a decade. For the G.O.P., the
pledge was a neat way to synchronize the interests of the very rich and
the defiant antigovernment streak of the white middle class, and the key
to making it work, for as long as it has, has been simple: letting
voters know they expect to be held accountable. If an elected official
bucks the tax pledge, voters have a specific reason to send them home
and the politician has no excuses.

**[A promise to protect abortion rights would]{.underline}** not have
the same kind of moneyed network behind it that the tax pledge does. But
it would **[carry]{.underline}** the same **[emotional and political
weight]{.underline}**. In the end, all politicians have to answer for
their records.

Say that Democrats committed, for once, to prioritizing action over
whatever solution Washington considers reasonable. Call it the Abortion
Access Pledge and turn running against the threat of a national abortion
ban into a chance to run for something, too.

Don't quibble, don't be distracted by debates over whether or when a ban
will happen. Instead, decide on a handful of action items around
abortion access and get everyone who wants a vote or a dollar to say it
out loud: "I will support abortion access in these ways and if I don't
follow through, you should kick me out."

I am honestly unsure if it matters what those action items are; I do
know [Democrats will have to throw out any concern for the appearance of
moderation]{.underline}. Right now, all the ideas about bridging the gap
to abortion access sound extreme. But so did the tax pledge at one
point. So did overturning Roe v. Wade.

[Take allowing abortions[ on federal
land](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/06/27/nominal-ways-president-biden-could-expand-abortion-rights/).
Biden could declare the policy so]{.underline}. Candidates would only
have to pledge to support it. Yes, the policy would invoke an avalanche
of untested legal theories and complicated jurisdictional questions.
[But Democrats who want to save the lives of those in need of an
abortion can't fall back on "it's complicated" as an excuse to not even
try.]{.underline}

If you want something less complicated --- something that would also
help roll out abortions on federal lands --- make a pledge not to vote
for any appropriation bill that carries the Hyde Amendment, which bans
federal funding for most abortions. On its own, abolishing the Hyde
Amendment would not greatly expand access outside states where abortion
is legal. But combined with abortion access on federal property, the
government could act even more directly to help those seeking abortion
care. Stonewalling Hyde-burdened budgets could lead to a government
shutdown, but if you think that ruins a party's reputation forever,
well, you are probably a current Democratic office holder.

**[Embracing a politics of fear on reproductive rights unites two of the
constituencies the Democrats need to edge out the G.O.P. in key narrow
races]{.underline}** (Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Georgia). First,
[hammering home the danger of a national ban may]{.underline}
sufficiently [alarm moderate voters in the suburbs]{.underline},
**[convincing them to abandon Republicans]{.underline}**. Second,
addressing the widespread sense of betrayal among progressive voters
will help keep them activated. The threat of a national abortion ban is
also a national message. [Democrats can make it clear that the party
can't risk a single loss, no matter how lopsided the polls
are]{.underline}. And then there is the simple truth underpinning this
entire strategy: Protecting abortion rights is popular.

This plan --- where Democratic leaders take real political risks --- is
untried. But it's worth the gamble. [Bold action is the only way to
assure voters that they are prepared to do whatever it takes when other
rights are on the chopping block]{.underline}. Most significantly,
prioritizing responsiveness to voters would reset the entire framework
of Democratic campaigns.

The only way this strategy could truly backfire is if Democrats run on a
promise and then break it, again. And expect to be re-elected, again. Of
course, that is what Democrats are doing right now. "Protect Roe" was
their rallying cry; it turns out that's all it was.

Fear often divides, but it can also unite. When you have a common
threat, there is an opportunity for a common mission. This threat is no
longer beyond the horizon --- it's at the door. [Now, Democrats, decide
on a mission]{.underline}.

[In the wake of the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade,

midterms.]{.underline} "If you want to change the circumstances for
women and \... girls in this country, please go out and vote," President
Joe Biden emphasized in a speech on Friday. "For God's sake, there's an
election in November." As Democrats stare down the typical backlash the
president's party experiences in the midterms[, they hope abortion
rights will energize voters in key battleground states and districts and
combat this dynamic, helping them keep their majorities in the House and
Senate.]{.underline} Whether it does remains to be seen: [There are
still several months before the midterm elections]{.underline}, and
voters are focused on a number of issues, including the economy.
[According to multiple polls]{.underline} conducted in June and July,
[inflation remains a top issue for many voters, though abortion rights
is highly ranked as well. Giving Democratic lawmakers hope, too, are
other surveys that have found Democrats are more likely to say they'll
vote in the midterms because of abortion rights compared to Republicans.
It's worth noting that most of these surveys were national, and that
abortion rights could have a bigger impact at the regional level,
particularly in states where abortion rights are actively being
threatened or restricted. When it comes to congressional races, the
issue is likely to have the largest effect in swing Senate and House
seats where candidates are in extremely tight contests --- races in
which even small shifts in turnout and enthusiasm could make the
difference.]{.underline}

### Uq ---- AT innovation bill thumper 

#### McConnell kills the bill---no thumper

kill the bipartisan China bill if Democrats revive their agenda with Joe

Mitch **[McConnell vowed to effectively kill major bipartisan
legislation]{.underline}** if Democrats pursue their own plan.
McConnell\'s statement is a major and perhaps [fatal setback for a
lengthy effort to pass a China bill]{.underline}. Lawmakers on both
sides have moved to bulk up the US semiconductor industry, which is a
major part of the plan. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell declared
on Thursday that he would block the progress of President Joe Biden\'s
major bipartisan semiconductor bill aimed at thwarting China if
Democrats continue to pursue a separate economic plan crafted from the
ashes of Build Back Better. \"Let me be perfectly clear: [there will be
no bipartisan USICA as long as Democrats are pursuing a partisan
reconciliation bill]{.underline},\" McConnell tweeted. In response,
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\'s office blasted McConnell as a tool of the
\"Chinese Communist Party.\" Related video: The moment Ketanji Brown
Jackson was confirmed to SCOTUS Scroll back up to restore default view.
\"Make no mistake: Senator McConnell is now siding with the Chinese
Communist Party against American workers and American industry,\" Pelosi
spokesperson Henry Connelly wrote on Twitter. \"And why? So that the
GOP\'s pals in Big Pharma can keep ripping off Americans struggling to
afford their prescriptions.\" McConnell\'s statement all but spells the
death knell for bipartisan talks that have dragged on throughout the
year as both chambers crafted their own sweeping plans aimed at
reinvigorating America\'s supply chain amid China\'s rise. It comes as
Democrats inch closer to striking a deal at reviving their stalled
party-line climate and healthcare bill. **[Democratic and Republican
leaders continuously feuded over the China bill\'s scope in negotiations
this year.]{.underline}** Republicans pressed Democrats to ditch
provisions dealing with trade, labor, and immigration to keep it
smaller. A chunk of the bill set aside \$52 billion to shore up the US
semiconductor industry during a chip shortage, a key Democratic
priority. Centrist Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema are
key votes on Biden\'s stalled economic agenda. All 50 Senate Democrats
must band together to advance the smaller spending bill with a
tie-breaking vote from Vice President Kamala Harris. Spokespeople for
Manchin and Sinema didn\'t immediately respond to a request for comment.
Biden and the White House have repeatedly made clear that passing the
China bill is a major priority. The legislation, the USICA or United
States Innovation and Competition Act, is at times just called [the
China bill. It is so massive that it has sparked a reputation for all of
the various special-interest driven provisions that have found their way
into the text]{.underline}. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo has
repeatedly warned that failing to pass the legislation could have
devastating consequences. Raimondo said on CNBC on Monday that
GlobalWafers might not follow through on its plans to build a \$5
billion factory in Texas if the bill fails. \"It has to be done before
they go to August recess,\" said Raimondo, who has been closely involved
in the talks. \"I don\'t know how to say it any more plainly[. This deal
... will go away, I think, if Congress doesn\'t act]{.underline}.\"
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer authored the Senate\'s version of
the bill, a sign of just how serious leadership is in passing it. Biden
also pushed it during his State of the Union address in March. The
Senate passed its \$250 billion package last June. The House advanced
its own plan in February. Both sides have been trying to sort out the
details for months. \"To compete for the best jobs of the future, we
also need to level the playing field with China and other competitors,\"
Biden said during his address. \"That\'s why it is so important to pass
the Bipartisan Innovation Act sitting in Congress that will make record
investments in emerging technologies and American manufacturing.\"

### Uq---dems win---AT empirics 

#### Empirics flow neg---president's party has been able to gain seat's in midterm elections 

Dean **Obeidallah, 22,** 3-8-2022, \"Opinion,\" MSNBC,
https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/democrats-chances-2022-midterm-elections-are-better-doomsayers-predict-n1290695

Anyone else sick and tired of hearing so-called political experts
predict that Democrats are going to lose badly in this year\'s midterms?
Apparently it doesn't matter that in President Joe B[iden's first year,
6.6 million new jobs were reported, the strongest first year of job
gains of any president since our government began collecting such data
in 1939.]{.underline} Nor does it appear to matter [that unemployment is
down from 6.7 percent in former President Donald Trump's last full month
in office to 3.8 percent and that wages are up 5 percent over the past
year.]{.underline} There are multiple signs that tell us Democrats could
not only hold on to the House but even pick up a few Senate seats.
Pundits tell us it's an "ironclad" rule --- as Fivethirtyeight.com put
it --- that the president's party loses congressional seats in midterm
elections. Hence, headlines that predict Democrats will lose this
November in a "wipeout" and a "bloodbath." If you listen to these
people, you might be tempted to cancel the 2022 election and simply
crown the GOP the winners of the House and the Senate. Democrats should
be concerned going into November. They hold only a nine-seat margin in
the House, and the Senate is divided 50-50, with Vice President Kamala
Harris serving as a tie-breaking vote. However[, there are multiple
signs that tell us Democrats could not only hold on to the House but
even pick up a few Senate seats given that there is an open Senate seat
in Pennsylvania and a vulnerable GOP incumbent in
Wisconsin]{.underline}, **[both states Biden won in 2020]{.underline}**.
For starters, while Biden won the White House in 2020, Democrats lost 13
seats in the House. That wasn't good for the party, obviously, but for
2022 purposes, it means **[the most vulnerable Democrats are already
gone.]{.underline}** On the flip side, not a single Republican incumbent
in the House lost in 2018. Good luck with GOP pulling that trick twice
and not losing even one of the 213 House seats they currently hold in
2022. For example, in New York, the recently finalized congressional map
that reflects the 2020 census data is expected to result in Democrats
picking up three current Republican seats in November. Plus, history
tells us that there have been **[two times in the modern era that a
president's party gained seats during midterm elections ---and the
circumstances that led to those victories apply to 2022 in varying
degrees]{.underline}**. In 1998, with Bill Clinton in the White House,
Democrats gained five House seats. [How did Democrats buck history? GOP
arrogance and overreach]{.underline}. The House GOP, led by then-Speaker
Newt Gingrich, impeached Clinton for lying about his affair with an
intern, Monica Lewinsky. But as midterm exit polls found, two thirds of
voters didn't think Clinton --- who was leading a strong economy ---
should have been impeached, and they cast their votes accordingly.
Today's GOP is even more arrogant and heavy-handed than Gingrich's GOP
was. Consider the Texas law that bans abortion after six weeks and
forces a woman who is raped to carry her rapist's fetus to term. [That
abomination of a law is being copied by numerous Republican-controlled
states despite the fact that 65 percent of Americans believe the Supreme
Court should uphold its landmark Roe v. Wade decision and only 29
percent support the Supreme Court striking down the constitutional right
to abortion access]{.underline}. The Republicans don't care what a
majority of Americans think; they only care about imposing their extreme
religious beliefs upon the rest of us. In 1998 with Bill Clinton in the
White House, Democrats gained five House seats. How did Democrats buck
history? GOP arrogance and overreach. Ditto for the party's overreach by
banning books and what they wrongly call critical race theory (CRT).
Americans are becoming increasingly aware that so-called CRT bans are
racist laws designed to prevent teachers from sharing the history of
Black achievement and Black suffering at the hands of white bigots. Look
at Virginia where Republican Glenn Youngkin won the governor's race in
2021 based in part on his attacks on CRT. A recent poll found that 57
percent of Virginians oppose banning CRT and only 37 percent support it.
That finding helps explain why Youngkin, who won in November with 51
percent of the vote, is already underwater with a 41 percent approval
rating. With only a few exceptions, these extreme abortion bans, bans on
books and CRT, and voter suppression efforts in 19 states are embraced
by Republicans nationwide. To animate their own voters, **[Democrats can
and should use the GOP's tyranny against them in 2022]{.underline}**.
The second time in recent history that a president's party picked up
seats during a midterm election was 2002, the year after the 9/11
terrorist attacks, when President George W. Bush was in the White House
with a sky-high approval rating and Republicans gained eight House seats
and two in the Senate. While Jan. 6, 2021, and 9/11 are not nearly the
same, **[the 2022 election will be the first after the "domestic
terrorism" waged on the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters trying to
prevent the peaceful transfer of power]{.underline}**. The big
difference, of course, is that after 9/11, Americans united against
those who attacked us. In contrast, the GOP overwhelmingly supports and
celebrates former President Donald Trump, who radicalized his supporters
with lies about the election and called them to Washington to "stop the
steal." Since then, Trump has defended the attackers and suggested he
would pardon them if he were elected president again. Republicans want
2022 to be a referendum on Biden's performance given that his approval
ratings are in the low 40s, but Democrats should turn the tables and
frame the election as a referendum on Republican extremism: from the
oppressive laws mentioned above to their embrace of the man who gave us
Jan. 6. That could spike Democratic turnout. Zeeshan Aleem Midterm
elections are won and lost on turnout. In the 2018 midterm, when voter
turnout was the highest in 100 years, Democrats won 40 House seats.
Contrast that with 2014 when voters came out in the lowest number in
over 70 years: Democrats lost 13 House seats and nine Senate seats.
Ignore the pundits and the noise. [When Democrats come out big,
Democrats win big. This year is no exception; in fact, history tell us
that victory in this November's election is completely in the hands of
Democrats.]{.underline}

### ATL abortion right XO 

#### XO wasn't sufficient -- only the promise of congressional action mobilizes voters

Grace **Panetta 22**, 7-9-2022, \"Democrats\' priorities have crumbled
under Biden and time is running out for the party to deliver before the
midterms,\" Business Insider,
https://www.businessinsider.com/why-democrats-cant-pass-bidens-agenda-2022-7

Enshrining abortion rights nationally: On June 24, the Supreme Court
overturned Roe v. Wade, a move that made abortion illegal in some
states. Most congressional Democrats are in favor of a national abortion
rights law, and have voted in favor of the Women\'s Health Protection
Act. The bill would make abortion legal in every state and undo most
restrictions. It is similar to the abortion rights set out under the
now-defunct Roe, though it also allows abortions after viability for
undefined \"health reasons.\" For that reason, Republicans have called
it \"extreme\" and refused to support the legislation. It passed the
House but has already failed twice in the Senate this year. Eleven more
senators would be needed to pass the legislation under the 60-vote
threshold. Manchin opposes the legislation, saying it goes beyond Roe.
That\'s why Biden calling for a filibuster carve-out on June 30 is
unlikely to be effective. Manchin and Sinema remain staunchly opposed to
abolishing the filibuster for any reason. Even without the filibuster,
Democrats lack the 50 votes they would need to pass their bill. GOP
Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Collins both support abortion rights
but say Democrats\' bill has gone too far because it doesn\'t create
moral or religious exemptions. Collins is working on a bipartisan
abortion rights bill with Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, but one senior
Democratic Senate aide told Insider that Democratic women senators and
abortion rights groups say privately that they don\'t see the
legislation going anywhere because nine Republicans would need to get
onboard, \"which everyone knows will never happen right now.\"
[Democrats have stressed that they want to put Republicans on the spot
over the issue to draw a contrast between the parties ahead of the
November midterms. Only remote possibilities exist for enshrining
abortion rights nationally. One would be for some Republicans to cross
over on the filibuster and on the abortion rights bill]{.underline}.
Another would be for Democrats and Republicans to compromise on which
measures they\'re willing to support. One former leader in the
reproductive rights movement told Insider that even a limited bill, such
as guaranteeing access to abortion in the first trimester, would help
90% of patients seeking to terminate pregnancies. In such a scenario,
states would be allowed to raise the gestation floor if they choose.
[But both sides remain staunchly divided on the issue, meaning that
without a supermajority in the Senate or the abolishment of the
filibuster, it could remain in limbo with a patchwork of rules from
state to state for years to come.]{.underline}

abortion access, but advocates urge him to do more,\" USA TODAY,
https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/07/08/roe-v-wade-biden-executive-order-protecting-abortion-access/10010822002/

WASHINGTON -- Facing pressure from his party to act more aggressively to
safeguard abortion access, President Joe Biden on [Friday announced
steps his administration is taking, including protecting access to
medication and making legal representation available to women who choose
to travel out of state for the procedure]{.underline}. Advocacy groups
have pressed for strong action, such as a declaration of a public health
emergency and leasing federal property to abortion providers, since the
Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade. Biden has resisted such
moves. "This is a moment -- the moment -- the moment to restore the
rights that have been taken away from us and the moment to protect our
nation from an extremist agenda," Biden said in the White House
Roosevelt Room before signing an executive order that outlines the steps
his administration will take. Biden\'s order instructs the Department of
Health and Human Services to protect and expand access to abortion care,
including access to medication approved by the Food and Drug
Administration as safe and effective for over 20 years. The order tasks
the department with expanding access to reproductive health services,
including family planning and providers, emergency contraception and
long-acting reversible contraception such as intrauterine devices,
according to a fact sheet distributed by the White House. The
administration promised to increase outreach and public education on
abortion and to ensure the safety of patients and providers, including
mobile clinics sent to borders to provide care for out-of-state
patients. [An advocacy group pushing to restore and sustain public
insurance said Biden\'s actions don\'t go far enough]{.underline}. \"We
are glad to see the White House start to implement a whole of government
approach to abortion access, **[but this plan, which the White House
committed to months ago, is both late and not enough]{.underline}**,\"
said Morgan Hopkins, interim executive director of campaigns and
strategies at All\* Above All. Mini Timmaraju, president of NARAL
Pro-Choice America, praised Biden's order as a "really strong next
step\" but said she wants to see what specific actions the
administration is going to take. \'THIS IS NOT OVER\':Harris warns
Supreme Court may target gay marriage, contraception next Biden called
for the creation of a task force on access to reproductive health care
and sought to provide protection to women who travel across state lines
to access clinical abortion services. The attorney general\'s office was
instructed to give assistance to states that offer legal protection to
out-of-state patients and health care providers. The attorney general
and the White House counsel\'s office will convene private attorneys
that offer free legal services, as well as bar associations and public
interest groups, to encourage legal representation to patients,
providers and other groups that provide reproductive services. Two weeks
ago, the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, the decision in 1973 that
established a constitutional right to abortion. Friday, Biden cast last
month\'s ruling as a throwback to the 1800s when women didn\'t even have
the right to vote. His voice rising, Biden said a 10-year-old girl in
Ohio got pregnant as the result of a rape and was forced to travel to
Indiana to get an abortion. "A 10-year-old girl should be forced to give
birth to a rapist\'s child?\" he asked. \"I can\'t think of anything
that is much more extreme.\" Biden called again for Congress to overturn
the decision by writing Roe v. Wade into federal law. He said he
supports changing filibuster rules in the Senate to make it easier to
codify the right to abortion and privacy into federal law. Sixty votes
are needed in the Senate to pass most legislation because of the
filibuster. Changing the rules would allow senators to write Roe v. Wade
into law with a simple majority. Getting rid of the filibuster is up to
the Senate, and there aren't enough votes to make that happen. The
fastest way to overturn the ruling, Biden said, is to pass a law to
protect abortion rights. "For God's sake, there's an election in
November," he said. "Vote! Vote! Vote! Vote!" BEYOND ABORTION:Ruling
overturning Roe v. Wade sparks debate about Supreme Court\'s legitimacy
amid partisan passions Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier
Becerra said federal officials are working to increase access to
medication abortion in limited circumstances, ensure providers have
appropriate training and resources and direct the Centers for Medicare
and Medicaid to take legal steps to protect family planning care.
Biden\'s order instructs Becerra to submit a report in 30 days on
protecting access to abortion medication and contraception and ensuring
that women have access to emergency medical care. Fatima Goss Graves,
president and chief executive officer of the National Women\'s Law
Center, lauded Biden for taking steps to protect access to reproductive
services but warned that "speed and intensity" are demanded to get
people the care they need. "Undoing these injustices will take efforts
by all of us, including using the full force of the federal government,"
she said. Hopkins, of All\* Above All, said more women are denied
reproductive care every day as a result of the Supreme Court ruling.
\"The ripple effects of the Supreme Court decision will spare no one --
and the harm will fall hardest on people of color working to make ends
meet,\" she said. \"President Biden must do more.\" March for Life,
which opposes abortion, criticized Biden for issuing the order. \"It is
tragic that this administration is using its power to push for more and
more painful abortions which harm women and take innocent lives,\" said
the group\'s president, Jeanne Mancini. \"Our nation today faces
significant challenges, not enough abortion is not one of them.\"

#### Increasing defense spending on NATO is unpopular across the board---causes the dem's to lose swing votes

Steven **Kull 19,** April 2019, Dr. Steven Kull is a political
psychologist who studies the impact of public opinion on public policy.
He has conducted polls and focus groups in over 30 countries around the,
Program for Public Consultation, No Publication,
https://publicconsultation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/NATO_Report_0419.pdf

**[Defense Spending Levels by NATO Allies]{.underline}** Respondents
were told about the dispute between the US and other NATO members
regarding their lower levels of defense spending towards NATO. Presented
three options for dealing with this situation, the least popular option
was to press European countries to spend more by threatening to
disengage from Europe and possibly withdraw from NATO. The **[most
popular option for both parties]{.underline}**, supported by half,
**[was to remain part of NATO, but reduce U.S. military investments to
bring them more in line with the level that the Europeans
spend]{.underline}**. The second most popular option was to press
European countries to spend more, but not to threaten to disengage or
withdraw from NATO. Respondents were introduced to the dispute between
the US and European NATO members over defense spending levels as
follows: For some years now there has been a dispute between the U.S.
and other members of NATO about their level of defense spending. The
U.S. has complained that it spends about 4-5% of the U.S. economy on its
military, while European nations generally spend about 2% or less, some
as low as 1%. Europeans point out that the amount that the U.S. spends
is not only in Europe but also in Asia and in the U.S. homeland, and
that Europe already spends twice as much as Russia, which is NATO's
primary focus. Nonetheless, in 2014, the European NATO partners agreed
to set a goal to increase their defense spending to at least 2% of their
budget. There have been some increases, but only 4 of the 26 European
countries have met this goal, though several more are expected to reach
this level within the year. One of the largest countries, Germany, is
unlikely to reach it at any point in the near future. They were then
told that there is some debate about what the U.S. should do about this
situation and were asked to evaluate three options with an argument in
favor of each one. Three possible approaches were presented. The first
argument stressed that the Europeans should stop taking advantage of the
US after it freed them from Hitler and defended them during the Cold
War, that the Europeans can afford to do their share, and that the
Russians pose a smaller threat, so if Europeans do not do more, the US
should be ready to disengage from Europe. This argument did only
moderately well with an overall majority of 56% finding it convincing.
However, there was a sharp partisan divide: 76% of Republicans, but only
39% of Democrats found it convincing. Likewise in very red districts 61%
found this argument convincing, but only 43% in very blue districts. The
second proposal considered was to press European countries to spend
more, but to refrain from threatening to disengage from Europe or
withdraw from NATO. The argument for this stressed that it is not really
feasible to withdraw from Europe or NATO, that the US should not make
such a threat, that doing so could backfire by emboldening Russia and
causing Eastern European countries to draw closer to Russia, and that
overall, it is better for the US to stand close to Europe and that doing
so is affordable. This argument did far better than the first argument.
Overall 80% found it convincing as did 87% of Democrats. Among
Republicans , 72% found it convincing --- roughly the same as the 76%
who found the argument for the first proposal convincing --- suggesting
substantial ambivalence. In very red districts , 72% found the argument
convincing --- more than the 61% that found the argument for the first
proposal convincing. The third proposal was that the **[US should remain
in NATO but adjust its military investment there to be more in line with
the European investmen]{.underline}**t. This argument stressed **[that
the European members of NATO spend a substantial amount on the military
and many troops under arms]{.underline}**, that their reluctance to
spend more is understandable given the low level of threat from Russia,
that [adjusting US commitments might cause Europeans to do
mor]{.underline}e, but even if they do not, NATO will still be far
stronger than Russia. This argument also did quite well with **[74%
finding it convincing. Among Republicans (77%) and in very red districts
(75%) it did the best of all arguments, with 72% of Democrats
concurring]{.underline}**. Asked for their final recommendation, the
clear favorite, endorsed by about half overall and by both parties, was
the third option. The least attractive option was to threaten withdrawal
from Europe and NATO , which was endorsed by just 12% overall ---one in
five Republicans and a miniscule 4% of Democrats. The option of pressing
the Europeans but not threatening withdrawal was endorse d by 35%
overall --- Republicans 29%, Democrats 41%. Those who voted for Donald
Trump in 2016 did not differ much from Republicans. One in five said the
US should threaten to withdraw, while 48% favored adjusting the US
military commitment.

#### NATO security cooperation worries voter and is perceived as trading off with domestic issues that appeal more to swing voters

Bruce **Stokes 20**, 9-4-2020, \"US Electorate Shows Distrust of the
Realities of Foreign Policy,\" Chatham House -- International Affairs
Think Tank,
https://www.chathamhouse.org/2020/09/us-electorate-shows-distrust-realities-foreign-policy

Whoever occupies the White House after the election, it is evident the
emphasis will be on 'America First', and that only characteristics and
approaches will differ. If Donald Trump is re-elected, his electoral
base will support a continuation of isolationist, protectionist
policies. If Joe Biden becomes president, he will enjoy some limited
popular backing for international re-engagement, but his voters still
clearly want him to prioritize domestic issues. Implications for the
foreign policy of the next US administration are evident. America may
have a long history of isolationism, but that should not be confused
with ignorance of the growing interconnectedness of today's world.
However, **[Americans are struggling to find a new equilibrium for their
country's role in the world]{.underline}**. Around seven-in-ten hold the
view that the United States should take a leading or major role in
international affairs, and the same number acknowledge that
international events affect their daily life. But **[Americans remain
reticent about global engagement, and half of registered voters believe
other countries take unfair advantage of the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates. This clear contradiction is mirrored in what
can be expected from the election victor, with a Joe Biden
administration likely to speak for those who want America to lead, while
a second Donald Trump administration is expected to continue complaining
about US victimization by an ungrateful world. A majority (57%) of
Americans say foreign policy is 'very important' to them as they decide
who to vote for in the 2020 election. This may seem like a high
priority, but American polls often show many issues are 'very important'
to voters. What matters is relative importance and **[foreign policy
pales in comparison with the significance the public accords to the
economy (79%) or healthcare (68%).]{.underline}** Immigration (52%) and
climate change (42%) are of even less relative importance to voters.
Notably, despite the deep partisanship in American politics today,
**[there is no difference between Republican and Democrat voters on the
low priority they accord foreign policy]{.underline}**. And barely
one-third (35%) of the public give top priority to working with allies
and international institutions to confront global challenges such as
climate change, poverty and disease --- in fact only 31% say improving
relations with allies should be a top foreign policy priority over the
next five years. However, despite this apparent lack of support for
international relations, a rising majority of Americans believe
international trade is good for the economy --- running contrary to many
international assumptions that Americans are inherently protectionist.
But this increased interest may not amount to much in reality. Americans
also believe trade destroys jobs and lowers wages. Trump is clearly
wedded to a protectionist worldview and may continue to try dismantling
the World Trade Organization (WTO). Biden is unlikely to initiate any
new trade liberalizing negotiations given what would be, at best, a slim
Democratic majority in the Senate and anti-trade views held by many
unions and blue-collar voters among his constituency. Any political
capital he commits to trade is likely to focus on reforming the WTO, but
privately his advisers admit they are not optimistic. In addition, both
Biden and Trump face strong public support for ratcheting up pressure on
China, although their lines of attack may differ, with Trump likely to
double down on tariffs while Biden would work closely with Europe on
both trade and human rights issues. More broadly, almost three-quarters
(73%) of Americans now express an unfavourable view of China, up 18
points since the last presidential election. One-quarter of Americans
classify Beijing as an 'enemy' with almost half saying the US should get
tougher with China on economic issues, although attitudes do divide
along partisan lines, with Republicans generally more critical of
Beijing, but Democrats are tougher on human rights. On immigration,
Trump's policies are out of step with the public. Six-in-ten Americans
oppose expanding the border wall with Mexico, 74% support legal status
for immigrants illegally brought to the United States as children ---
including a majority of Republicans (54%) --- and as many Americans
favour increasing immigration as support decreasing it. But Trump has
already promised to double down on limiting immigration if he wins
because it is what his Republican electoral base wants and, as with
trade, this is one of his long-expressed personal beliefs. If he wins,
expect more mass roundups of undocumented people, completion of his
border wall and stricter limitations on legal immigration. In contrast,
Biden is likely to loosen constraints on immigration because he believes
immigration has been good for the economy and the Democratic party is
increasingly dependent on Hispanic and Asian voters, the two fastest
growing portions of the population. However, open borders are not a
Biden option. The US foreign-born population is at near-record levels
and, every time in American history the portion of foreign born has come
close to being 14% of the total population --- in the 1880s, the 1920s
and now --- there has been a populist backlash. Democrats cannot risk
that again. On climate change, there is strong evidence the American
public is increasingly worried, and likely to support rejoining the
Paris Agreement if Biden is elected and increases US commitments to cut
carbon emissions. But the public also appears unlikely to punish Trump
if, as promised, he leaves that accord, and he is almost certain to
continue denying climate science in the interest of the coal, oil, and
gas industries. The public's concern about global warming does not
necessarily translate into support for taking substantive action. There
is a huge partisan divide between the number of Democrats (68%) and
Republicans (11%) who say climate change is a very important issue in
the 2020 election. When pressed on what action they want on climate
change, and who they trust to do it, Americans are less likely than
Europeans to accept paying higher prices. A carbon tax stands no chance
of passing the Senate, thanks to moderate Democrats from fossil-fuel
states, and America's love affair with large, CO²-emitting vehicles
shows no signs of ebbing. The outcome of the 2020 US election will
almost certainly not be determined by foreign concerns, although an
international crisis --- a terrorist incident, a military confrontation
with China or North Korea --- could impact voting in an unforeseen way.
But given the mood of the American electorate, if Trump is re-elected,
there will be scant public pressure for a more activist, collaborative
US foreign policy, beyond support for a tough line on China, while a win
for Biden will give more room for some international initiatives. **[But
public opinion data is clear. Voters want the next US president to focus
first on domestic issues]{.underline}** --- overcoming the pandemic,
digging the country out of a deep economic hole, calming racial
tensions, and reversing inequality. The outcome of the election may end
America's recently antagonistic foreign policy and halt the
deterioration of its international role. But dramatic American
re-engagement appears unlikely as the public's priorities lie elsewhere.

### L---Generic---Emerging tech 

#### NATO driven innovation alienates millennial and young voters which depresses dem turn out 

Will **Moreland 19**, 4-3-2019, associate fellow with Foreign Policy at
Brookings. His research focused on the future of U.S. alliances and
multilateralism in a more geopolitically competitive world \"Love me
today, love me tomorrow? Millennials and NATO,\" Brookings,
https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2019/04/03/love-me-today-love-me-tomorrow-millennials-and-nato/

As NATO leaders commemorate the 70th anniversary of the Washington
Treaty, talk of crisis again swirls around the alliance. Yet, against
President Trump's continued skepticism and reports lamenting the lapse
in American leadership, signs for optimism surface. Surveys reveal
relatively high public support for NATO. The 2019 Munich Security
Conference saw the largest, and bipartisan, congressional delegation.
Yet, today's groundswell of public support is likely to instill false
confidence in the future of Americans' sentiments. Backing the alliance
is easy today, particularly among the rising millennial generation, as
opposition to unpopular policies of Donald Trump. However, when examined
in the context of millennial foreign policy priorities, questions emerge
as to NATO's role vis-à-vis the issues that motivate them---and,
therefore, the long-term support for the alliance. Despite Trump's
longstanding inclinations, NATO today is in a relatively good place with
the American body politic. As the most recent Chicago Council survey
finds, not only do "a majority of Americans continue to favor
maintaining (57 percent) or increasing (18 percent) the U.S. commitment
to NATO...the 18 percent of Americans who want to increase the U.S.
commitment to NATO is the highest level ever recorded in Chicago Council
surveys." If talk of a "commitment" seems too vague, respondents broadly
feel comfortable, at least in theory, backing up words with action.
Fifty-four percent favor using American forces to respond to a Russian
invasion of a Baltic state---a new record since the question was first
asked in 2014. Such figures help explain the continued, bipartisan
willingness to flout the president on this issue. **[This support is not
limitless]{.underline}**. For a nation weary from nearly two decades of
war, the **[matter of burden-sharing is a real issue]{.underline}**. A
Europe perceived to be shirking a growing responsibility for its own
defense---such as recent troubling reports from Berlin---could squander
that support. Nonetheless, for an alliance turning 70, NATO looks
decently well-armed to weather another storm. People carry European
Union flags during a protest ahead of a visit by Russian President
Vladimir Putin, in Budapest February 16, 2015. Putin will discuss
Russian gas supplies to Hungary when he visits Budapest on Tuesday, an
adviser to the Russian president said on Monday. The trip will be
Putin\'s first bilateral visit to a European Union country since June
2014, reflecting a warming in ties that has irked some of Hungary\'s
allies in the EU and NATO. REUTERS/Laszlo Balogh (HUNGARY - Tags:
POLITICS CIVIL UNREST) - LR2EB2G1H542J no immediate action and is
largely synonymous with endorsing partnership with Europe. When the
Trump administration---particularly the president---has driven
trans-Atlantic rifts over issues from trade to the Iran Deal (Joint
Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA), NATO stands out as a symbol of
continued cooperation in a turbulent relationship. But as time passes,
it is an open question how NATO's mission tracks with the foreign policy
priorities of millennials, fast becoming the largest voter demographic
in the United States. While representing a cooperative partnership,
which millennials do value, [NATO has less direct bearing on the
generation's top five foreign policy goals,]{.underline} as found by
research from the Chicago Council and Charles Koch Institute in 2018[.
Asked for their priorities, respondents cited the importance of:
Protecting American jobs]{.underline}: **[70 percent Preventing the
spread of nuclear weapons: 64 percent Securing adequate supplies of
energy: 59 percent Improving America's standing in the world: 52 percent
Combating world hunger: 47 percen]{.underline}**t Though important
issues in their own right, these objectives are not traditional ones
with which NATO was created to contend directly: territorial defense and
the maintenance of stability in Europe. Such an absence speaks, in part,
to [the millennial generation's distance from NATO's founding
moment]{.underline}. For a cohort without any memory of great power
conflict, NATO's key role in deterring war is baked into assumptions
about how the world is naturally. Yet if, as my colleague Robert Kagan
argues, "we have lived so long inside the bubble of the liberal world
order that we can imagine no other kind of world," then my millennial
generation risks great stakes on this assumption. A lack of historical
memory that conflict can spark and spread even in Europe is tragic, but
not unreasonable. After all, even a scholar as thoughtful on these
issues as Barry Posen can question the U.S. commitment to NATO in the
popular press without considering the U.S. role in warding against the
return of "the German question." In this broader historical context,
[the absence of "maintaining U.S. military
superiority]{.underline}"---another option on the survey---[from
millennials' top five priorities not only contrasts with preceding
generations]{.underline}, but raises concerns as to whether the alliance
will be resourced to perform its mission or become more of a hollow
symbol. THE NEED FOR INFORMED SKEPTICISM Millennial skepticism of a
militarized American foreign policy is not baseless. From lived
experience, armed force appears ineffective at best, an expensive
boondoggle at worst---especially in the Middle East. Particularly since
9/11, as Robert Malley and Jon Finer have argued, "Washington has become
addicted to quick military fixes" when "sometimes what's needed is a far
broader approach." Nonetheless, a U.S. strategy containing a military
component oriented toward the forward defense of democracy in an
increasingly contested world---as NATO does in Europe---reflects a
different dynamic. While millennials are more familiar with scenes of
American soldiers patrolling desert streets or civilians mourning
casualties from drone strikes as exemplifying military power, the
forward deployment of U.S. forces, as a deterrent, has helped maintain
peace in Europe and Asia. As a recent RAND Corporation report notes,
"U.S. troop presence was associated with...a lower likelihood of
interstate war." That deterrence factor, however, is increasingly called
into question. As the congressionally-charted National Defense Strategy
Commission report details in Europe: "Russia is seeking to create
situations of military strength vis-à-vis America and its allies, and
despite its limited resource base, it is having considerable success."
To repair this growing disparity, the commission asserts, "**[the United
States needs more than just new capabilities]{.underline}**; it urgently
requires new operational concepts that expand U.S. options and constrain
those of China, Russia, and other actors." As NATO allies confront
critical questions about the allocation of resources, a more nuanced
understanding of the U.S. military role in NATO and Europe is vital to
an informed debate on U.S. strategy. Such a conversation should be a
debate, not merely acceptance of a limitless military [budget. Already
millennial skepticism of pursuing military primacy is increasingly
represented in an ongoing and vibrant policy debate---particularly among
progressives]{.underline}. Considering a spectrum of views, including
deviating from military primacy to military sufficiency, is necessary in
a climate of heightened geopolitical competition and limited resources.
To draw on President John F. Kennedy, the United States may be willing
to "pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship," but it is not
wise to pay every price, bear every burden, meet every hardship.
Washington must deploy its assets strategically in a competition with
authoritarian powers that encompasses a host of domains. The military
sphere cannot, and will not, be the end all of the growing competition.
But nor can it be wished away as a factor that requires a serious and
informed conversation among millennials as to how defense issues,
including NATO, should be included in American foreign policy.

Behind the increase: Google's spending jumped roughly 27 percent, from
\$7.5 million in 2020 to \$9.5 million in 2021, as the company has
sought to fend off antitrust legislation and has dealt with concerns
about YouTube's contribution to right-wing radicalization. Facebook and
Amazon broke their own spending records, with Amazon shelling out \$19.3
million and Facebook spending more than \$20 million. Facebook's
spending spree came as the company dealt with fallout from whistleblower
Frances Haugen's revelations; Amazon has faced antitrust heat as well as
significant labor complaints. Apple, which has had a more muted presence
in Washington, spent \$6.5 million in 2021 --- a small number compared
to its "Big Four" peers but still vastly more than smaller tech
companies such as Spotify, which spent \$820,000 in 2021. --- Speaking
of those smaller rivals ... 2021 was a huge year for the small- to
medium-sized tech companies, which say they have been harmed by
gatekeeping by giants like Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple.
Complaints from companies like Oracle, Yelp, Tile and Spotify have taken
center stage and informed antitrust legislation now moving through the
House and Senate Judiciary Committees. As a result, '**[Big Tech''s
rivals are spending more than ever]{.underline}**, too: Oracle, the
software company known for taking on Google, spent \$9.1 million on
lobbying in 2021, up from about \$8 million the year before. Microsoft,
though hardly a small company, has gained a reputation for lobbying
against its tech-sector rivals. It spent about \$10.2 million on
lobbying in 2021 compared to \$9.4 million in 2020, an increase of
roughly 8 percent. Fox Corp., the media company owned by Big Tech
antagonist Rupert Murdoch, increased its spending by about 22 percent
between 2020 and 2021, as the company lobbied in favor of the antitrust
bills in both chambers. Fox spent \$3.6 million in 2021, compared with
\$3 million in 2020. Epic Games, which is locked in a legal battle with
Apple over Apple's App Store, registered its first in-house lobbyists
during the last month of 2021, reporting \$40,000 in in-house lobbying
spending. Epic also tapped a pair of high-powered outside lobbying firms
last year, the Gibson Group and Subject Matter. --- Overall, this
spending pales in comparison to the tens of millions spent by Facebook,
Amazon and Google. But it's still notable that these **[companies are
dialing up their presences in Washington, readying themselves for all
the fights ahead]{.underline}**. NATSEC HAWKS ARE CIRCLING --- As the
tech antitrust bills pick up steam in the Senate, [Google has been the
tech company most forcefully pushing the idea that reforms could
threaten national security]{.underline}. "[Handicapping America's
technology leaders would threaten our leading sources of research and
development spending]{.underline}," Google's president of global affairs
and chief legal officer, Kent Walker, wrote in a blog post last week. He
argued that the bill that received a markup, S. 2992 (117), would "give
a free pass" to foreign companies and cited a letter from last year from
twelve former U.S. national security officials who argued the antitrust
bill could hurt U.S. competitiveness. (All 12 former officials have ties
to major tech companies, as POLITICO previously reported.) The
legislation would prohibit Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Google from
favoring their own products and discriminating against rivals on their
platforms. Google spokesperson Julie Tarallo told MT that the company
believes S.2992 "risks threatening our global competitiveness and
security, which is why we will continue urging Congress to take more
time to consider these and other unintended consequences."

### L---Generic---DOD funding 

#### Plan perceived as driven by the military industrial complex as a scheme to increase's DOD funding which angers dems who see it as trading off with domestic issues like Roe 

Robert **Weissman 22**, 6-7-2022, \"Americans Widely Reject Proposals
for More Pentagon Spending --- So Should Congress,\" Data For Progress,
https://www.dataforprogress.org/blog/2022/6/7/americans-widely-reject-proposals-for-more-pentagon-spending

The United States spends, by far, more on its military than other
nations. [U.S. military spending is more than the next nine countries
combined; it is 12 times the amount Russia spends.]{.underline} Yet
[demands persist from the military-industrial complex to spend ever
more]{.underline}. For the upcoming year (fiscal year 2023), the Biden
Administration has requested a \$31 billion increase in Pentagon
spending, to \$813 billion. [Congress]{.underline} is **[poised to add
even more to that total]{.underline}** --- with some saying the United
States should spend a trillion dollars on the military budget. The House
and Senate Armed Services committees are expected to vote in June on
spending levels in the National Defense Authorization Act. Polling from
Data for Progress and Public Citizen in May 2022 indicates that spending
more on the military than requested by President Biden would be out of
step with the public. The polling shows: **[A strong majority of voters
oppose an increase in military spending above Biden's
request]{.underline}**. **[Sixty-three percent of those polled say the
military\'s budget should remain at the level that Biden and the
Department of Defense requested]{.underline}**. Military spending
concerns a majority of Americans, with 55 percent of voters reporting
they are "somewhat concerned" or "very concerned" about current
proposals for \$813 billion in defense spending next year. [Democrats
overwhelmingly say Pentagon spending should not exceed current levels
when thinking about proposals to increase funding]{.underline} (83
percent say spending levels are too high or should remain the same,
while 8 percent say military spending should be higher). When informed
about how much the military is poised to receive, as compared to other
agencies, a majority of Republican voters say the military budget should
not be raised further (51 percent, versus 37 percent who think too
little is spent). There are very strong policy arguments to cut military
spending significantly. Not only does the United States vastly outspend
other nations, it doesn't effectively manage what it does spend. The
Pentagon is unable to pass an audit, and Pentagon spending is replete
with waste and fraud both small (a spare parts maker with a 3,800
percent profit level) and large (the defective and dysfunctional F-35
program that will cost more than \$1.7 trillion over its projected
50-year lifespan, according to the Project on Government Oversight). And
[money allocated to the Pentagon is money that could instead be spent on
priority domestic and human needs, and to ensure true national
security]{.underline}. For example, last year Congress increased
Pentagon spending by \$28 billion over the Biden Administration's
request. That same amount could instead have been spent to scale up
global vaccine production and end or at least diminish dramatically the
pandemic. Did the extra \$28 billion for the Pentagon do anything to
make us safer? By contrast, is there any doubt that our national
security would have been massively improved if we had helped vaccinate
the world? Pentagon cuts also are popular. Fifty-six percent of
Americans supported reinvesting 10 percent of the Pentagon budget into
coronavirus relief, housing, and education in the first year of the
pandemic, according to Data for Progress polling. In this immediate
moment, however, the **[congressional debate is not about Pentagon cuts,
but about further increases]{.underline}**. Those arguing for more
Pentagon spending say it is necessitated by inflation. This argument
ignores the fact that **[the Biden request already accounted for
inflation]{.underline}** and the fact that the Pentagon does not
experience inflation in the same way as the general economy, in part
because many of its costs are set by long-term contracts. Others say the
Ukraine war necessitates more spending. But the U.S. already spends far
more than Russia, and Ukraine-specific expenses are being funded by
supplemental spending bills and should not be incorporated into the
Pentagon's base budget. The arguments for still more Pentagon spending
are, in short, red herrings. But that's no surprise. In truth, no matter
what Pentagon spending level Biden proposed, the military-industrial
complex would respond with the same one-word answer: more. It's not an
argument the American people are buying, however. Congress shouldn't
either.

#### Any slight increase in DoD budget angers voter and is seen as a bolt from the blue 

Mark **Pocan 20**, 7- 20, 2020, Congressman Mark Pocan (D-WI) is the
Co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus \"The American People
Agree: Cut the Pentagon's Budget ,\" Data For Progress,
https://www.dataforprogress.org/blog/2020/7/20/cut-the-pentagons-budget

\$740 billion. That's how much Congress is on track to approve for the
defense budget in 2021. In the middle of a pandemic, as millions of
Americans face unemployment, evictions, and a broken healthcare system.
In 2020, the defense budget was 90 times the size of the budget of the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Now, we face a
pandemic with a lack of resources, no nationwide testing plan, 3.6
million cases and over 138,000 deaths. Maybe, just maybe, we could have
been better prepared for this disaster if the budget for our public
health agency wasn't about 1 percent of the defense budget. On Tuesday,
Congress will vote on the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), but
before that, they will vote on my amendment with Congresswoman Barbara
Lee and Senator Bernie Sanders to cut the bloated defense budget by 10
percent. We have a choice. We can ignore the systemic problems that this
pandemic has brought to the surface, continue with businesses as usual
and rubber stamp a \$740 billion giveaway to defense contractors. Or we
can **[listen to the American people and save \$74 billion towards their
urgent needs]{.underline}**---housing, healthcare, education and more.
In Data for Progress' [latest poll, the majority of American voters want
us to put their needs over the profits of Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and
Boeing. Fifty-six percent of voters support cutting the defense budget
by 10 percent to pay for priorities like fighting the coronavirus,
education, healthcare & housing---including 50 percent of
Republicans]{.underline}. image1.png Fifty-seven percent of voters
supported cutting the defense budget by 10 percent if funding was
reallocated to the CDC and other more pressing domestic needs. Only 25
percent of people opposed the cut, that means more than twice as many
people support an over \$70 billion cut to our defense budget than
don't, a 2:1 ratio. The polling is abundantly clear: the American people
know that new nukes, cruise missiles, or F-35s won't help them get their
next unemployment check, or pay next month's rent, or put food on their
family's table, or pay for the costs of healthcare in a global pandemic.
Over the past four years, during a time of relative peace, America has
increased its defense spending by 20 percent, over \$100 billion. There
is [no other part of the Congressionally-appropriated federal budget
that has increased by this much]{.underline}---not education, not
housing, and not public health. We have seen the effects of supporting
this endless cycle of exponential defense spending. In January,
President Trump's unilateral assassination of Iranian General Hassan
Soleimani almost led us down the path of another endless war. In the
last month, we have seen the President order military responses to
civilian protestors in Lafayette Park so he could hold a photo-op and we
have seen Department of Homeland Security agents swarm the city of
Portland assaulting and arresting protesters. The Pentagon's bloated
budget incentivizes people like President Trump to threaten wars abroad
and unleash militarized troops on our own people. The American public
has seen this firsthand and this new poll clearly shows that they are
fed up. Our nation is facing a pandemic that has killed more American
people than the Iraq War, the Afghanistan War, 9/11, the Persian Gulf
War, the Vietnam War and the Korean War combined. Yet, despite the
coronavirus clearly being the greatest threat to our nation currently,
**[Congress]{.underline}** is instead about to **[authorize and
appropriate more money for defense spending]{.underline}** than anything
else. Tomorrow, you will likely hear some Republicans say that our
amendment to cut 10 percent from this budget is another attack from the
"leftist mob" in Congress, that we want to undermine this country's
safety. We think America is only as safe as its people at home feel, and
right now with rampant unemployment, millions losing healthcare,
underfunded education, and families facing eviction---the American
people need our help. So often, as progressive members of Congress, we
try to explain to our Democratic and Republican colleagues that the
American people are more progressive than they think. We point to polls
showing overwhelming support for Medicare for All, for a Green New Deal
or a \$15 minimum wage. Progressive values are mainstream values,
because progressive values put people first. That's why a majority of
Americans support cutting our excessively large defense budget---because
they no longer see their values or needs reflected in the actions of the
Pentagon. Now it's up to us, the people they elected to represent their
interests, to hear them and take action. Tomorrow, Congress can
choose---the American people or not.

### L---Generic---AI 

#### Military-based AI cooperation fails. Public opposition and major private firms will refuse to cooperation.

Lin-**Greenberg 20**, postdoctoral fellow at the University of
Pennsylvania's Perry World House (Erik, "Allies and Artificial
Intelligence: Obstacles to Operations and Decision-Making," *Texas
National Security Review*, 3.2)//BB

[Tepid public support at home and abroad can stymie **alliance military
operations**]{.underline} in two ways. First, [public opposition to the
use of AI among allied populations may lead policymakers to restrict the
use of AI-enabled technologies for military operations]{.underline}. In
the event of future hostilities, for example, the South Korean or
[German governments might oppose an ally's use of
AI-enabled]{.underline} lethal weapon [systems]{.underline} on their
territory.60 Indeed, advocacy from the public and activist groups has
led a growing number of states --- including U.S. allies like Pakistan
and Jordan --- to call for bans on the use of lethal autonomous weapon
systems.61 Second, [civilian engineers and researchers that develop AI
technology may refuse to work on **military AI contracts**. Disruptions
to AI development can hinder the fielding of new capabilities and
generate mistrust between the government and civilian firms. Google
employees]{.underline}, for instance, [protested]{.underline} their
[involvement in]{.underline} Project Maven, a **[Defense
Department]{.underline}** program that uses **[AI]{.underline}** to
analyze video collected by military drones.62 In a letter to their CEO,
the employees argued that "Google should not be in the business of war,"
explaining that the company should not "outsource the moral
responsibility of \[its\] technologies to third parties," and that work
on Defense Department-backed AI would "irreparably damage Google's
brand."63 [The resistance ultimately led Google to **terminate** its
involvement in the contract and generated public criticism of the
Defense Department's AI efforts]{.underline}.64

#### AI policy drains PC 

George **Dvorsky 17**, 10-25-2017, \"Powerful Lobby Group Wants to Keep
AI Unregulated,\"
https://gizmodo.com/powerful-lobby-group-wants-to-keep-ai-unregulated-1819842165

The Information Technology Industry Council (ITI)---a Washington
D.C.-based [lobby group that boasts Google, Amazon, and Microsoft among
its many clients---is telling governments to think twice about
establishing laws to regulate AI.]{.underline} But given mounting
safety, ethical, and social justice concerns, is that such a good idea?
On Tuesday, ITI released its "AI Policy Principles," in which the lobby
group outlined "specific areas where industry, governments, and others
can collaborate, as well as specific opportunities for public-private
partnership." In the new document, ITI acknowledged the need for the
tech sector to promote the responsible development and use of AI, while
calling upon governments to support, incentivize, and fund AI research
efforts. But as for letting governments take a peek at an ITI client's
source code, or enact laws to steer the safe and ethical development of
AI, that's something it's a bit less enthused about. "We also encourage
governments to evaluate existing policy tools and use caution before
adopting new laws, regulations, or taxes that may inadvertently or
unnecessarily impede the responsible development and use of AI," notes
ITI in its new list of AI principles. "This extends to the foundational
nature of protecting source code, proprietary algorithms, and other
intellectual property. Failure to do so could present a significant
cyber risk." According to its mandate, ITI seeks to "encourage all
governments around the world---including the US government---to develop
policies, standards, and regulations that promote innovation and growth
for the tech industry." It represents some of the heaviest hitters in
the tech sector, including Amazon, Facebook, Google, IBM, and Microsoft,
[while claiming to be "the global voice of the tech sector" and "a
catalyst for preparing an AI world."]{.underline} ITI's document is
timely given just how important AI is starting to become, both in terms
of its burgeoning influence on our lives (whether it be a photo-sorting
app or an algorithm that invents new medicines), and in the global
economy (ITI estimates that AI will add at least \$7 trillion to the
global economy by 2025). But it's also [timely given the recent calls
for oversight and regulation.]{.underline} As Bloomberg reporters Gerrit
De Vynck and Ben Brody write: Hypersonic Plane From Venus Aerospace Will
Travel to the Edge of Space Big tech companies, and their software, are
coming under more scrutiny in the wake of news that Russian-sponsored
accounts used social networks to spread discord and try to influence the
outcome of the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Algorithms designed by
Facebook, Twitter Inc. and Google have also been criticized for
increasing political polarization by giving people the type of news they
already agree with, creating so-called "filter bubbles." And the
concerns don't stop there. Developers are starting to be criticized for
allowing their AI systems to adopt human biases and prejudices (a recent
Princeton study, for example, showed that some AI systems are sexist and
racist). There's also uncertainty about how AI will contribute to
technological unemployment, automated warfare, and computer hacking. And
there's still no consensus on the specific ethical or moral codes that
need to be imbued into these systems. There's also the frightening
potential, as thinkers like Elon Musk, Stephen Hawking, and others have
pointed out, for something to go horribly wrong with AI. As the recent
AI breakthrough by Google-owned DeepMind demonstrated, a fast takeoff
event, in which AI evolves into a superintelligent form, may happen
relatively quickly and without warning, thus introducing
catastrophic---and possibly existential---threats. As all of this is
happening, it shouldn't come as a surprise that some concerned observers
are calling for the government to step in. Musk has warned that
governments need to implement regulations "before it's too late," and
that it's only after things get out of hand that we tend to act. Two
years ago, the White House implemented a preliminary AI strategy, saying
AI needs to be ethical, that it must augment, and not replace, humans,
and that everyone should have a chance to participate in the development
of these systems. But as for formal regulations, the White House said
it's still premature. As former US president Obama told Wired last year,
"Most people aren't spending a lot of time right now worrying about the
Singularity---they are worrying about 'Well, is my job going to be
replaced by a machine?'" "**[A middle path between no regulation and
state regulation is to let industry regulate itself]{.underline}**,
which is the ITI approach. But this is far from ideal as well: it's
letting the fox guard the henhouse." Patrick Lin, director of the
Ethics + Emerging Sciences Group at California Polytechnic State
University, says that regulating new technologies is always a delicate
balancing act. "If you set regulation too early, then you may be betting
on the wrong standards, and that would be terrible for
commercialization, which is important," Lin told Gizmodo. "The same
problem exists with setting too many or unnecessary regulations; they
can create barriers to innovation. But commercialization isn't the only
value at stake here; public safety is another value in the equation. So,
if there's little or no regulation for technologies that can have
serious impact on our lives---from self-driving cars to AI systems that
make criminal sentencing and bank lending decisions---then that will be
bad for society. It's a mistake to have a knee-jerk reaction either way,
reflexively for or against regulation. Each technology is different and
needs to be considered carefully on its own merits." Lin says this
conversation is currently happening in regards to autonomous vehicles,
with one camp arguing that regulatory standards will put manufacturers
on the same page about safety-critical functions (which would protect
the industry from some liability), with the other camp saying we don't
know enough to start forging standards. "A middle path between no
regulation and state regulation is to let industry regulate itself,
which is the ITI approach," says Lin. "But this is far from ideal as
well: it's letting the fox guard the henhouse. There's no teeth to
enforce self-regulations if a company breaks rank; there may be even
less transparency than with government regulators; and many other
problems." Currently, the US has no federal agency dedicated to
regulating or monitoring AI, and it'll probably be a while before we see
anything like that (if ever). In the meantime, it'll be up to various
groups, both inside and outside the government, to monitor developments
in AI, such as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (to
oversee development of autonomous vehicles) and the Department of
Homeland Security (to monitor cybersecurity threats). Some private
individuals and companies have created their own groups, such as Musk's
OpenAI initiative and Google's DeepMind Ethics & Society group. But as
Lin points out, there's a "having your cake and eat it, too" aspect to
self-regulation. "On one hand, industry (correctly) says that AI is
going to be this game-changing, super-revolutionary thing, but on the
other hand, they often tell us not to worry about it, that they have it
handled," he said. "Worse, because the AI industry is so fragmented and
full of start-ups---or even individuals without formal education or
professional training, working from their basements---you couldn't
possibly get them all on board with your self-imposed regulations,
whereas government regulations can use the full force of law to achieve
compliance." Lin says that self-regulation may be better than no
regulation or uninformed regulation, especially when it's about a
technology that could cause major problems for society. As examples, he
points to fake news, dieselgate, biased decision systems, and so on.
Sara Wachter-Boettcher, author of Technically Wrong: Sexist Apps, Biased
Algorithms, and Other Threats of Toxic Tech, says she's happy to see an
acknowledgement of the problem and development of shared principles, but
the underlying message to her seems to be, "trust us, we're working on
it." "I would ask, what evidence do we have that they've got a handle on
removing bias from AI? Why should we trust tech companies when we see
examples of them embedding bias into software, or launching products
with unintended consequences, every day?," Wachter-Boettcher told
Gizmodo. "I understand that it's not as simple as lifting the curtain
and letting the public look at the code, but there needs to be
agreed-upon and enforced levels of transparency and accountability.
While industry says it's afraid of slowing down innovation, I think the
rest of us should be a lot more worried about the real risk of flying
headfirst into even more inequality, bias, and unintended harm." In an
email to Gizmodo, Jaan Tallinn, the co-founder of Skype, said "we need
regulation eventually, but first we need more research into what a
positive and effective regulation should look like." And indeed, those
arguing for regulations are having some difficulty articulating what
actually needs regulating, and how it should be implemented and
enforced. Thankfully, however, these conversations have started and the
frameworks for AI regulation are starting to emerge. As Tallinn noted,
we're going to need regulations eventually. The self-serving principles
set out by ITI can be seen as pre-emptive attack to delay the
inevitable, and to protect its clients from what it sees as meddlesome
and potentially costly intrusions. And self-serving it is; it can hardly
be said, for example---and as stated in the new list of
principles---that the ITI clientele could use some additional financial
support from the government. As Oxford philosopher Nick Bostrom wrote
last year, "Great resources are devoted to making \[progress in AI\]
happen, with major (and growing) investments from both industry and
academia in many countries." At the same time, investments "in long-term
AI safety\...remains orders of magnitude less than investment in
increasing AI capabilities." That ITI did not list the funding of AI
safety initiatives by industry, government, and private sources as an
"AI principle" is as problematic as it is revealing. Moreover, it's not
immediately obvious **[that profit-driven companies with cranky
shareholders in the background are in any way interested in constraints
imposed by outside forces, or in voluntarily contributing to the public
good]{.underline}**. Regulations and government oversight exists in the
absence of pro-social forces within the overarching capitalist
framework. "We can hope that corporate self-interest will align with
public interests, but that is a giant leap of faith, and many companies
in ITIC don't exactly have a great track record at winning public
trust," Lin told Gizmodo. "It's important to remember that they're not
in the business of protecting the public or promoting democracy---their
business is business. When profit motives and humanitarian motives
collide, take a wild guess which one usually wins."

### L---- Generic -- Biotech

#### Biotech developments unpopular

Cary **Funk et. Al 16**, 11/2/16, "U.S. Public Wary of Biomedical
Technologies to 'Enhance' Human Abilities", Pew Research Center Science
& Society,
https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2016/07/26/u-s-public-wary-of-biomedical-technologies-to-enhance-human-abilities/

Cutting-edge [bio]{.underline}medical **[techn]{.underline}**ologies
that could [push the boundaries of human abilities may soon be
available]{.underline}, making people's minds sharper and their bodies
stronger and healthier than ever before. But a [new Pew Research Center
survey of U.S. adults shows that majorities greet the possibility of
these breakthroughs with more wariness and worry than enthusiasm and
hope]{.underline}. Many in the general public expect continued
scientific and technological innovation, broadly speaking, to bring
helpful change to society[. Yet when people are queried about the
potential use of emerging technologies]{.underline} for "human
enhancement," **[their attitudes are not nearly as
affirming]{.underline}**. The survey examines public attitudes about the
potential use of three emerging technologies that could fundamentally
improve people's health, cognitive abilities or physical capacities. The
specific examples were: gene editing to give babies a lifetime with much
reduced risk of serious disease, implanting brain chips to give people a
much improved ability to concentrate and process information and
transfusing of synthetic blood to give people much greater speed,
strength and stamina. These are just three of many enhancements that
scientists and bioethicists say could arise from biomedical technologies
now under development. None of the three are currently available for the
purpose of enhancing otherwise healthy babies or adults, though all are
in a research and development phase or are being tested in very limited
circumstances for therapeutic uses, such as helping patients to recover
from a stroke or spinal cord injury. (For background see "Human
Enhancement: The Scientific and Ethical Dimensions of Striving for
Perfection.") When Americans are questioned about the prospect of these
specific kinds of enhancements for healthy people, their views are
cautious and often resistant: Majorities of U.S. adults say they would
be "very" or "somewhat" worried about gene editing (68%), brain chips
(69%) and synthetic blood (63%), while no more than half say they would
be enthusiastic about each of these developments. Some people say they
would be both enthusiastic and worried, but, overall, concern outpaces
excitement. More say they would not want enhancements of their brains
and their blood (66% and 63%, respectively) than say they would want
them (32% and 35%). U.S. adults are closely split on the question of
whether they would want gene editing to help prevent diseases for their
babies (48% would, 50% would not). At least seven-in-ten adults predict
each of these new technologies will become available before they have
been fully tested or understood. Some 73% say this about gene editing,
while an identical share says the same about synthetic blood; 74% says
this about brain chip implants. Majorities say these enhancements could
exacerbate the divide between haves and have-nots. For instance, 73%
believe inequality will increase if brain chips become available because
initially they will be obtainable only by the wealthy. In addition, many
Americans think recipients of enhancements will feel superior to those
who have not received them; 63% say this about synthetic blood
transfusions in particular. By the same token, but more optimistically,
half of Americans or more think recipients of enhancements will feel
more confident about themselves. Substantial shares say they are not
sure whether these interventions are morally acceptable. But among those
who express an opinion, more people say brain and blood enhancements
would be morally unacceptable than say they are acceptable. More adults
say the downsides of brain and blood enhancements would outweigh the
benefits for society than vice versa. Americans are a bit more positive
about the possibility of gene editing to reduce disease; 36% think it
will have more benefits than downsides, while 28% think it will have
more downsides than benefits. Opinion is closely divided when it comes
to the fundamental question of whether these potential developments are
"meddling with nature" and cross a line that should not be crossed, or
whether they are "no different" from other ways that humans have tried
to better themselves over time. The survey data show several patterns
surrounding Americans' wariness about these developments. First, there
are strong differences in views about using these technologies for
enhancement depending on how religious people are. In general, the most
religious are the most wary about potential enhancements. For example,
those who score high on a three-item index of religious commitment1 are
more likely than those who are lower in religious commitment to say all
three types of enhancement -- gene editing to give babies a lifetime
with much reduced risk of disease, brain chip implants to give people
much improved cognitive abilities and transfusions with synthetic blood
to give people much improved physical capacities -- would be meddling
with nature and crossing a line that should not be crossed. Americans
who have lower levels of religious commitment are more inclined to see
the potential use of these techniques as just the continuation of a
centuries-old quest by humans to try to better themselves. Second,
people believe that technologies that would bring more dramatic or
extreme changes to human abilities are less acceptable than technologies
that cause less dramatic or temporary changes. For example, 47% of
Americans consider the use of synthetic blood substitutes to improve
physical abilities an "appropriate use of technology" if the resulting
change to people's speed, strength and stamina would be "equal to their
own peak abilities." But if the same enhancement results in physical
abilities "far above that of any human known to date," far fewer (28%)
say it would be an appropriate use of technology. The same pattern
occurs as Americans consider the potential use of gene editing and
devices implanted in the brain to augment human abilities. Third, women
tend to be more hesitant than men about wanting the enhancements
potentially available from these cutting-edge technologies. They are
also more negative than men in their judgments and expectations about
what such enhancements would mean for society. Interestingly, although
majorities of the public expect these enhancements would lead to
increased social inequality, there are, at best, only modest differences
in attitudes about these topics by race, ethnicity, educational level,
income or age. Finally, there are some similarities between what
Americans think about these three potential, future enhancements and
their attitudes toward the kinds of enhancements already widely
available today. Many are skeptical about the need for cosmetic
procedures and other current enhancements. For example, 61% of Americans
say people are too quick to undergo cosmetic procedures to change their
appearance in ways that are not really important. Roughly a third (34%)
say elective cosmetic surgery is "taking technology too far." And,
overall, 54% of U.S. adults say elective cosmetic surgery leads to both
benefits and downsides for society, while 26% express the belief that
there are more downsides than benefits, and just 16% say society
receives more benefits than downsides from cosmetic surgery. These are
some of the key findings from a new nationally representative Pew
Research Center survey of 4,726 U.S. adults conducted online and by mail
from March 2 to 28, 2016. The margin of sampling error at the 95%
confidence interval for results based on the total sample is plus or
minus 2.2 percentage points.2 What do we mean by human enhancement?
Human enhancement encompasses a wide range of biomedical interventions
intended to increase human abilities. In simple terms, this means making
biochemical, surgical or other changes designed to improve cognitive,
psychological or physical capacities, and can include changes aimed at
bettering physical and mental health. The modern discussion of human
enhancement often is traced to an essay by Julian Huxley in 1957. The
essay suggested the human species could "transcend itself" through
biological intervention.3 Over the millennia, people have tried to
improve their abilities by learning, as well as using tools and gadgets.
Enhancement is different from those attempts at human betterment because
it involves biomedical intervention in the body to notch up a person's
capabilities. Many also think about human enhancement as distinct from
therapeutic interventions. Thus, medical treatments aimed at restoring a
person's ability to see or hear -- for example, to regain motor control
after a stroke or spinal cord injury -- would stand in contrast to
enhancing abilities in otherwise healthy and well-functioning people
beyond their current capacities (or some typical level).4 The line
between therapy and enhancement often is blurry, but this distinction
provides a framework for thinking about human enhancement in everyday
terms. Although the phrase "human enhancement" is used primarily by
ethicists, there are numerous enhancements available today. Examples
include: anabolic steroids used to promote muscle development;
reproductive technologies, including tubal ligation and vasectomies to
increase human control over the reproductive system; and an array of
cosmetic interventions to change people's physical characteristics. Two
widely available cognitive enhancements include the (off-label) use of
modafinil and Ritalin (methylphenidate) to stimulate a person's focus,
concentration or memory. Some also consider vaccines a form of
enhancement aimed at making people healthier by reducing the probability
of disease, although others consider vaccines to be firmly rooted in
medical or therapeutic treatment, not enhancement.5 Until now,
biomedical scientists have had the capacity to make only relatively
modest enhancements in people. However[, the convergence of innovations
in biotechnology, nanotechnology, information technology and other
fields is raising the possibility that future enhancements could enable
much more dramatic changes to human abilities]{.underline}. The pace of
innovation is difficult to predict and sometimes takes much of the
scientific community, let alone the broader public, by surprise. The
development of CRISPR, a gene-editing technique, is one example in which
potentially far-reaching techniques evolved very rapidly, within the
space of just a few years. Pew Research Center rooted much of this study
in [exploring public attitudes about breakthroughs that could expand the
boundaries of human limits]{.underline}, potentially creating even
healthier, stronger and smarter humans. In particular, the study focuses
on U.S. public reactions to three potential kinds of enhancement: gene
editing to give a healthy baby a much reduced risk of serious diseases
and conditions over their lifetime, implanting a computer chip in the
brain to give a healthy person a much improved ability to concentrate
and process information, and using synthetic blood substitutes to give a
healthy person much greater speed, strength and stamina. (For
comparison, survey respondents also were asked about a number of
procedures, such as elective cosmetic surgery, that are widely available
today.) The three future-oriented scenarios are meant to reflect the
range of enhancements being discussed by scientists and others as
potentially on the horizon, but it is by no means an exhaustive list.6
None of the techniques behind these ideas is being used for "enhancing
purposes" today, although all exist in some form of development for
therapeutic or medical applications. They were chosen in part because
they each raise potentially enticing prospects. What if we, as a
society, could virtually do away with illness? What if humans could all
raise their thinking capacity manyfold? And what if synthetic "super
blood" could boost physical prowess to "superman" and "superwoman"
levels? Whatever appeal these ideas may have, they also raise
fundamental questions about what it means to be human. From the earliest
days of civilization, people have sought to better their condition
through the use of tools, medications, surgeries and other therapies.
But as new scientific and technological breakthroughs arise, so do
questions about whether such developments move beyond limits set by God,
nature or reason. Thus, this research is aimed in part at understanding
where, if at all, the public might "draw the line" on human enhancements
and the possibilities they could bring to society.

#### Biotech lobbyists means the plan costs PC

Jason **Mast 18,** 19, 11-18-2019, \"In rare political foray, top
biotech investors urge Congress to reject drug pricing bill,\" Endpoints
News,
https://endpts.com/in-rare-political-foray-top-biotech-investors-urge-congress-to-reject-drug-pricing-bill/

Thirteen of the [top biotech venture capitalists]{.underline} in the
country wrote a letter last week warning lawmakers [that if Congress
passes a drug pricing bill]{.underline} House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has
put before lawmakers, [they won't be able to invest in biomedical
research]{.underline} at their current rate, and patients will suffer.
"If policies such as those included within H.R. 3, the Lower Drug Costs
Now Act, are passed, our ability to continue to invest in future
biomedical innovation will be severely constrained, thus crushing the
hopes of millions of patient waiting for the next breakthroughs to treat
or cure their cancers, rare genetic diseases, Alzheimer's, or other
serious and life-threatening conditions," they wrote in a letter
addressed to the highest-ranking Democrats and Republicans in the House
and Senate and acquired by Endpoints News. The list of signatories
includes Arch Venture Partners' Robert Nelsen, Bay City Capital's David
Beier, Flagship Pioneering's Doug Cole, RA Capital Management's Peter
Kolchinsky and Pappas Capital's Arthur Pappas. They write they have over
\$20 billion invested in private and public biopharmaceutical companies.
The investors join the larger pharma companies in expressing alarm about
the price controls in Pelosi's bill. Pfizer is urging voters to "Tell
Congress: Reject the Dangerous Drug Pricing Bill." While the [large
pharma companies have long peddled in Washington through the lobbying
group PhRMA and have amped spending to record levels as drug pricing
reform has gained traction]{.underline}, [biotech venture capitalists
have largely been more reluctant to enter the political
fray.]{.underline} Increasingly, though, the debate around drug pricing
reform and what it might mean for R&D has centered around the smaller
biotechs these VC funds keep afloat. Last week, STAT ran a piece quoting
tiny biotechs as fearing a "nuclear winter" if the Nancy Pelosi-backed
bill passed. In October, Bobby Dubois, the CSO of the industry-backed
National Pharmaceutical Council told Endpoints that he couldn't be sure
that a fall in revenue for big pharma would lead to cuts to R&D spending
but that it was very likely that such a bill would cut off dollars from
smaller biotechs. Biotechs' high startup costs and attrition rate, the
theory goes, make them dependent on huge potential payouts. Without
those, investments would dry up. The bill would also likely derail the
biotech IPO market, which is how venture capitalists have earned much of
their money in biopharma in recent years. Unveiled in September, the
Democratic bill --- which contains elements Republicans have backed but
has little chance of passing the Senate --- would tether the price of
the nation's 250 most expensive drugs to an international price index
and all-but-force companies to negotiate the final figure with the
federal government. An early Congressional Budget Office analysis
estimated the bill would reduce federal spending on Medicare Part D by
\$345 billion between 2023 and 2029 but also lead to between 8 and 15
fewer drugs being brought to market over the next 10 years, although
**[the CBO said the effect on innovation was difficult to quantify. In
the letter, the VCs argued such a system would be "granting the U.S.
government essentially unchecked authority" to set prices and pin those
prices to countries that "systematically undervalue" medical
breakthrough]{.underline}**s. "Biotech investment already is a high-risk
enterprise..." they wrote. "If, after we invest hundreds of millions of
dollars over a decade or more to achieve such success, the government
can impose an artificially low price on the few new drugs that make it
to market, our robust biotech investment ecosystem will become
unsustainable." The disagreement between the VCs and Democratic and some
Republican lawmakers is both around whether the cuts will affect
innovation and the value of some of that innovation. The VCs described
the therapies they back as "miracle drugs, with the ability not just to
treat, but to actually cure, so many genetically-based diseases and
other serious conditions." In past pushes for drug pricing reform,
advocates have mostly said that [that rhetoric is
overstated]{.underline} and pricing controls will leave R&D spending
mostly untouched. But a few Democrats, including Florida Representative
Darren Soto and California Representative Anna Eshoo, now argue an
uptick in access is worth losing a few drugs. "Three hundred forty-five
billion dollars in savings versus the cost of eight to 15 fewer drugs
over 10 years," Soto said at a recent hearing before the House Energy
and Commerce Committee, according to STAT. "I frankly think it's worth
it."

[to]{.underline} [Save]{.underline} Israeli-Palestinian [Security
Cooperation]{.underline},\" Lawfare,
https://www.lawfareblog.com/congress-has-less-60-days-save-israeli-palestinian-security-cooperation

Earlier this fall, Congress enacted a new law with potentially dramatic
implications for U.S. foreign policy toward the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict. The Anti-Terrorism Clarification Act (ATCA) exposes foreign
organizations that accept certain forms of U.S. foreign assistance to
the possibility of terrorism-related civil litigation in U.S. federal
courts. Fearful of potential liability, the Palestinian Authority and
Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) are now preparing to reject the
limited amounts of U.S. foreign assistance they still
receive---including support for an Israeli-Palestinian security
cooperation program that Israeli officials, among others, believe has
substantially improved the security situation in the West Bank. Aside
from a few astute observers, no one appears to have anticipated this
outcome. Or if anyone in the legislative process did, they did not
mention it. Both chambers of Congress approved ATCA through unanimous
voice votes. Only the House of Representatives engaged in any debate on
the matter, none of which raised potential policy ramifications. The
Trump administration, meanwhile, made no objections while the bill was
being debated, and the president himself signed it without reservations.
Yet support for the ATCA as-written has now soured. The Associated Press
reported on Nov. 30 that the White House plans to deploy Lt. Gen. Eric
P. Wendt, [the U.S. Security Coordinator (USSC) in charge of the
endangered Israeli-Palestinian security cooperation program, to Capitol
Hill in order to push for a legislative fix that will allow that program
to continue.]{.underline} **[Members of Congress, meanwhile, have
expressed growing concerns with some of the dramatic measures that U.S.
and Palestinian officials are preparing to pursue in response to the
ATCA]{.underline}**, including shutting down the USSC and U.S. Agency
for International Development (USAID) offices in the West Bank. All
corners, it seems, are hoping for some legislative solution. But it is
unclear whether Congress will be able to agree to one before Feb. 1,
2019, when the ATCA takes full effect. Adding a waiver position to the
ATCA is likely to be the most effective legislative solution, as it will
provide the executive branch with the flexibility necessary to continue
to use foreign assistance to advance U.S. foreign policy objectives
while allowing Congress and others to hold it accountable. Absent such a
legislative fix, the only means of escaping the ATCA's consequences will
be to challenge its constitutionality in federal court. But the
resulting litigation is likely to be costly and time-consuming with no
guarantee of a final resolution, imposing substantial costs on U.S.
foreign policy interests even if the ATCA is ultimately struck down.

within and outside the civil-military relations field and spurred the
publication of what has become a wide literature on the politics of
armies (particularly those of the United Kingdom, Italy, Russia, and
France) that takes a different approach to our conventional
understanding of civil-military relations.2 What makes these latter
books prescient in their instruction is that they disabuse Dr.

subservient to their political masters and eschew involvement in
domestic politics or in any system of governance. As the historical
record demonstrates (and, dare one suggest, a reflection of the U.S.
Armed Forces in a contemporary setting3 ), armies are all but inherently
political and need to be recognized as such if their effect on
civil-military relations is to be properly assessed. The
**[intrinsically political nature of military organizations is no less
true when it comes to armies' efforts in the education, training, and
equipping of foreign partner nations' armed forces, known as security
cooperation]{.underline}** (SC) and security assistance (SA). Yet much
of the American bureaucracy and legal framework for these activities
treat them as fundamentally technical problems that are susceptible to
improvement through better procedures. This technicism, to purloin a
term from Samuel Huntington,4 is arguably at the heart of many of our
failures and disappointments in building partner security forces (for
example, those of Afghanistan,5 Iraq,6 and Mali7 ) or in reforming
defense institutions in Central and Eastern Europe.8 Virtually every fix
proposed to partners is yet another technical or bureaucratic adjustment
rather than an acknowledgment of the fundamentally political nature of
these activities, both within a partner nation as well as among U.S.
agencies responsible for planning and carrying out the assistance
programs. The objective of this article is to argue that administration
officials and Congress face two different political challenges related
to improving SC and SA. Unless and until U.S. officials formulate
solutions to these political problems, both branches of government will
struggle to achieve more effective means of reforming partner nations'
key governmental institutions. First---and perhaps the easiest challenge
to address---is that [SC]{.underline} and SA [**have unintended
political consequences in the governm**ent]{.underline} institutions of
recipient countries and **[are not solely technical
tasks.]{.underline}** No one has expressed this point better than Mara
Karlin, albeit she was speaking in reference to weak states: Past
experience offers two key lessons for U.S. officials as they seek to
strengthen the security sectors of weak states. First, like all
state-building endeavors, these are political, not technical, exercises.
Instead of focusing narrowly on training and equipment**[, U.S.
policymakers responsible for implementing such programs must address the
purpose and scope of the U.S. role and the mission, leadership, and
organizational structure of the partner's military.9 Second, SC and SA
are highly politicized]{.underline}**; both are inefficient, because of
the lack of coordination between the Department of Defense (DOD) and
Department of State, and ineffective, because of lack of alignment with
national security goals (and/or foreign policy objectives). This
important reality needs wider appreciation by these departments, as well
as by Congress, if the U.S. Government is to improve its ability to find
value for money by improving partner nations' ability to defend their
sovereignty, let alone contribute to expeditionary operations. Recent
reforms initiated by Congress, most notably in the fiscal year (FY) 2017
National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), constitute a good first
effort at addressing these longstanding problems; however, a review of
the evidence shows that this legislation should be augmented to define
the problem as largely political in nature, as opposed to accepting the
traditional default assumption that it is solely technical, which would
have enabled it to call for even deeper reforms within these
bureaucracies. This article argues that, due to internal DOD politics
and the interorganizational politics within the U.S. Government,
suboptimal results ensue from the way the United States plans and
executes SC and SA. It then suggests legislative and policy changes that
might better take this reality into account. The stakes are high. If
U.S. strategy is to bring troops home from the so-called endless wars
overseas and let others do the fighting, then its success must be a core
priority. But only by reforming the way the United States organizes
itself to build allies' and partners' armed forces are we likely to meet
with any greater success than we have in the past.

MADRID --- For nearly a week, President Joe [Biden was the star
attraction at a pair of European summits]{.underline}, hailed as a
steadfast ally while he espoused the vital need for democracies to band
together against Russia's invasion of Ukraine. But once Air Force One
touched down in Washington late Thursday, [Biden returned to a starkly
different political reality]{.underline}. The days Biden spent at the
G-7 gathering in Germany and the NATO summit in Spain provided a brief
oasis for the president, who [must confront]{.underline} soaring
inflation, surging gas prices, questions about his political future and
**[a rage from his own party about a series of Supreme Court
ruling]{.underline}**s. Despite the domestic turmoil, and dismal poll
numbers, Biden rejected the notion that the nation was being doubted on
the world stage. "You haven't found one person, one world leader, to say
America is going backwards. America is better positioned to lead the
world than we ever have been," Biden told reporters at the conclusion of
the NATO summit in Madrid. "The one thing that has been destabilizing is
the outrageous behavior of the Supreme Court of the United States on
overruling not only Roe v. Wade, but essentially challenging the right
to privacy." But the trouble Biden left behind across the Atlantic was
what dominated the news conference he held at the end of the trip. [The
summits had undeniable successes --- including an agreement to admit two
new members to NATO --- yet they struggled to break through a domestic
news cycle back home.]{.underline} **[White House aides have long
conceded that]{.underline}** **[Biden's handling]{.underline}** of the
war in Ukraine, **[no matter how vital to global security, will win the
president and his party few votes back home]{.underline}**. And there is
growing concern that patience for sustaining the war effort --- both
among European allies and American voters --- could fade if the conflict
stretches into next year, exacerbating record inflation by sending
energy and food prices soaring. But for this week, there was no doubting
the worthiness of the cause, with the United States once again the
indispensable nation. In the stunning Bavarian Alps, Biden led the
leaders of the six wealthiest democracies to push for a measure to cap
Russian oil prices while also unveiling a global infrastructure plan
meant to pull some of the developing world out from the influence of
another authoritarian regime, China. And in sun-splashed Madrid, Biden
publicly declared the U.S. would stand with Ukraine while he worked
behind the scenes to assuage Turkey's concerns to pave the way for both
Finland and Sweden to join NATO. "Putin thought he could break the
trans-Atlantic Alliance. He tried to weaken us. \... But he's getting
exactly what he did not want." President Joe Biden Biden declared the
alliance would defy Vladimir Putin's war effort "for as long as it
takes," even if it meant spending billions more on weapons for Ukraine.
"Putin thought he could break the trans-Atlantic Alliance. He tried to
weaken us. He expected our resolve to fracture," Biden said. "But he's
getting exactly what he did not want." Not every item on the summits'
wish list was fulfilled, as talk of fighting climate change took a back
seat to trying to bolster fossil fuel production. And when asked at the
news conference about oil prices, Biden struggled to justify his
upcoming visit to Saudi Arabia, a nation he once deemed a "pariah." But
progress was made, experts said. "NATO enlargement and plans to increase
and move forces is a significant plus," said Richard Haass, head of the
Council on Foreign Relations. "When it comes to backing Ukraine
economically and militarily, it will all depend on what is actually
done." But Haass warned that the political morass back home "dilutes his
ability to lead as they raise questions about both his ability to
deliver and the long-term political direction of the United States."
While [Biden]{.underline} was **[in Europe, anger grew among Democrats
who believed he wasn't doing enough to support a woman's right to
choose]{.underline}**. He then made headlines Thursday when he
announced, for the first time, that he would support a carveout to the
Senate filibuster to protect privacy rights, which includes codifying
Roe v. Wade. "Any president contending with a Supreme Court that is
making decisions largely antithetical to most Americans, along with a
Senate gridlocked by the filibuster, would face a challenging political
landscape. What matters is how you deal with it," said Adrienne Elrod, a
Democratic strategist who advised Biden's transition. "His announcement
today that he supports getting rid of the filibuster for privacy issues
was smart, timely and has ignited an extra flame under an already
fired-up Democratic base." But it seemed unlikely the Senate would move
on the suggestion, and Biden's ability to protect abortion rights
through executive action was inherently limited. And the court didn't
stop there in its efforts to hinder the president's priorities. Days
before Biden left for Europe, it issued a decision to weaken gun control
laws. Then, just moments after Biden condemned the court on Thursday,
the Supreme Court released another ruling viewed as a crushing blow to
efforts at combating climate change. And while the White House has
pushed more Democrats to vote in this fall's midterms, to contribute to
larger Democratic margins in Congress, many **[Americans have been
frustrated by the lack of progress from a party that controls that White
House and both chambers of Congress.]{.underline}** And though Biden
downplayed worries among his international peers, many heads of state
openly condemned the Supreme Court's abortion decision while privately
whispering in both Bavaria and Madrid as to whether America would remain
a reliable partner after its next series of elections. "The world knows
that we are trouble. Americans know that we are trouble, too," said
Eddie Glaude, professor at Princeton University. "And, to be honest,
President Biden best put political calculus aside and fight like hell
for a democracy that seems to be in need of life support."

One area where the president is more likely to succeed in Congress is in
foreign policy. The amount of knowledge the president possesses in
matters of foreign policy, compared to members of Congress, is usually
much greater (Canes-Wrone, Howell, and

This information asymmetry in foreign policy leads Congress to be
relatively deferential to the president's proposals, therefore often
negating their need to act unilaterally in order to achieve the
president policy goals (Marshall and
Pacelle [2005](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/07343469.2019.1631905)).[11](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/07343469.2019.1631905#EN0011) Furthermore,
members of Congress often have little incentive to get involved in
foreign policy as there is little or no direct electoral return for them
(Mayhew [1974](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/07343469.2019.1631905)).[12](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/07343469.2019.1631905#EN0012)

[A president's [ability to **pursue policies**]{.mark} with Congress
is]{.underline} also [[affected by **institutional features** such as
**unified government**, **polarization**]{.underline}]{.mark},
filibuster or veto pivots, and the partisan composition of the chambers
(Bond and

Mayhew [2011](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/07343469.2019.1631905)).
Much of the previous work on presidential success in Congress has
focused on the distinction between unified versus divided government and
has found that presidents are more likely to shift policy when there is
unified government, which makes intuitive sense (Barrett and
Eshbaugh-Soha [2007](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/07343469.2019.1631905);

Mayhew [2011](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/07343469.2019.1631905)).
[If the same party controls the presidency and both chambers of
Congress, then]{.underline} it is reasonable to assume that [a majority
of the legislation that is proposed]{.underline} by the president
[will]{.underline} at least [make it **onto the legislative
agenda**]{.underline}. It also follows that during times of divided
government, [the president would have a hard]{.underline}er [time
getting legislation passed through Congress as a result of more
divergent policy preferences]{.underline}, which therefore impedes their
ability to form the necessary coalition needed to move the status quo
(Mayhew [2005](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/07343469.2019.1631905);
Ragusa [2010](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/07343469.2019.1631905)).[13](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/07343469.2019.1631905#EN0013) [The
effect of **divided government** is likely to be **exacerbated** with
**greater polarization** as well]{.underline}. As the parties'
ideologies diverge, fewer opportunities exist for bipartisan compromise
on issues, therefore potentially hampering the president's ability to
move policy.

Beyond simple majority status, the actual size of the president's party
within Congress also matters. Prior research demonstrates that the size
of the coalition that the president has within Congress affects the
likelihood that policy change is enacted (Bond and
Fleisher [1990](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/07343469.2019.1631905);

Maltzman [1999](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/07343469.2019.1631905)).
A bare majority is insufficient unless there is no diversity among
members' ideologies, and even substantial majorities may not suffice if
one faction holds substantially different policy preferences from the
rest of the party (such as the Southern Democrats during the 1950s and
1960s). Therefore, simple majority status is not sufficient for
understanding policy changes. Instead, one must consider the size of the
president's coalition and its ideological homogeneity as well
(Rohde [1991](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/07343469.2019.1631905)).
Increasing the size of the coalition the president has in Congress
should result in an easier path in passing
legislation.[14](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/07343469.2019.1631905#EN0014) This
should be especially true during times of distinctly different
ideological preferences between the majority and minority parties.

[A **[variety]{.mark} of factors**]{.underline} could
[[influence]{.mark} the [**success** of a president's]{.mark}
legislative proposal in [Congress]{.mark}]{.underline}. Based on the
president's proclivity to have legislative proposals realized through
law, [the [previous factors will influence]{.mark} the **[success or
failure]{.mark}** of a president's ability to have proposals make it
through Congress]{.underline}. Although presidents may not witness a
specific proposal become law, this does not mean their initiatives will
necessarily remain unrealized. Allowing an issue to remain at its status
quo is indeed an option; however, the president may also decide (or be
forced) to move policy
unilaterally.[15](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/07343469.2019.1631905#EN0015) There
are a multitude of reasons that a legislative proposal would receive no
action by Congress or the president. At times it is unclear why no
action is initially taken in Congress, because it is difficult to
ascertain a legislator\'s motivations in not pursuing a particular
course of action. In addition, the use of the Hastert Rule in the House
and the filibuster in the Senate could result in no action taken on
specific policy proposals. Gridlock is an issue that must be addressed
before legislation moves out of either chamber, which would stall
progress and result in no action taken by the legislative body.

[based on the fact that the **public** does not support the president,
Congress will **decide not to act**]{.underline}. When dealing with
legislative proposals, there are two specific endings---either the
status quo is changed (i.e., Congress or the president creates a policy
shift) or the status quo remains the same and the proposal receives no
action.

passage]{.underline}. at GEORGIAN COURT UNIV on April 25,
2015jtp.sagepub.comDownloaded from 16Journal of Theoretical Politics
23(1)In light of this self- and public perception of contemporary
presidents as 'Legislator-in-Chief', [political scientists have long
sought to assess the empirical reality of presidents' potential
influence in Congress.]{.underline} Although earlier generations of
scholars largely concurred with Woodrow Wilson's proclamation that 'The
President is at liberty, both in law and conscience, to be as big a man
as he can', subsequent research has rebutted such great man' conceptions
of presidential power in lawmaking. [More recent takes suggest
presidents may see some opportunities for exerting influence on Capitol
Hill, but as yet none has specified either the opportunities or the
systematic means by which presidents can exploit them]{.underline}. This
was what our paper sought to offer. Agreeing [that [presidents'
strategic options]{.mark} in Congress do indeed depend heavily on
factors **[beyond their control]{.mark}**]{.underline}, our model's
first insight is explicating the two systematic strategies presidents
have available for exerting influence in Congress: [they can target
marginal voters to shift the preference distribution on roll-call votes
and they can tar-get congressional leaders to censor the policy
alternatives making it that far]{.underline}. While the first of these
is widely recognized and studied, the second is not. [By detailing the
actual mechanisms of president-led coalition building on Capitol Hill,
ours is a theory that puts positive presidential power on a firmer
conceptual footing; legislative [opportunities are
**predictable**]{.mark}]{.underline} (if not controllable) [and
capitalizing on them depends on nothing more heroic than the normal
grist of legislative politics]{.underline}: arm-twisting, brow-beating,
and horse-trading. In this way, we subscribe to President Eisenhower's
observation: 'I'll tell you what leadership is: it's persuasion, and
conciliation, and education, and patience. It's long, slow, tough work'
(Hughes, 1963: 124). However, if **[[spending political
capital]{.underline}]{.mark}** [in the service of vote-centered and
agenda-centered strategies]{.underline} **[[is]{.mark} a
[necessary]{.mark} condition]{.underline}** [[for presidents to have
positive influence]{.mark} in Congress]{.underline}, it certainly is not
a sufficient condition. Instead, we find the exact policy return on a
particular presidential lobbying campaign is conditioned by the location
of the status quo, and the nature of leading opponents' and pivotal
voters' preferences. Beyond enjoying ample political capital, then,
[those **[presidents]{.mark} [who seek]{.mark} to [change]{.mark}
far-off status quos** and confront pliable leading opponents and/or
pivotal voters are expected to **[wield the greatest]{.mark}**
policymaking **[impact.]{.mark}**]{.underline} By comparison,
**[[presidents with]{.mark} little to [no p]{.mark}olitical
[c]{.mark}apital]{.underline}**, seeking to change centrist status quos,
or confronting opposing leaders and pivotal voters who staunchly oppose
their proposals [can **[find themselves with 'nothing to]{.mark}
[do]{.mark}** but stand there and take it',]{.underline} as Lyndon
Johnson once put it. Going forward, then, this more nuanced conception
of presidential power suggests presidential leadership in lawmaking
works through mechanisms different from those recognized previously and
is manifested in ways different from those tested previously. In fact,
our theoretical results set forth specific guidelines for properly
testing presidents' legislative influence. To conclude, let us briefly
delineate these empirical implications of our theoretical model. The
first and perhaps most important prescription is that [the [White House
does not treat all]{.mark} presidential [positions
equally]{.mark}]{.underline}: most receive nothing more than a mere
comment, a precious few get the White House's 'full court press', and
such prioritizing matters. Specifically, our basic hypothesis holds that
[presidents' positive influence depends heavily on lobbying to
work]{.underline}. The corollary, therefore, is that the crucial test of
presidents' influence is not whether 'skilled' presidents fare better
than their 'unskilled' counterparts, at GEORGIAN COURT UNIV on April 25,
but rather whether Congress responds differently to bills depending on
the presidents' lobbying, all else being equal. Second, our model
underscores the important distinction between policy outcomes and
roll-call votes. Because the White House wants to change the nation's
laws, the paramount metric of presidential success is the substantive
result. While political scientists lack any precise measure of policy
content, that is, there is no metric to judge one policy as 'units' more
liberal or conservative than another, the foremost tests of presidents'
influence should still highlight outcomes; they should address the
legislative process's ideological results. At the same time, to say
presidents' influence is primarily evidenced in substantive outcomes
does not mean its symptoms cannot be seen in roll-call votes. After all,
a requisite part of winning on the overall outcome is winning on the
relevant votes. On this score, our model has shown (1) tests of
presidential power should emphasize those votes that best indicate the
substantive outcome, such as CQ's 'key' votes and (2) tests based
exclusively on roll-call votes have missed an important aspect of
president-led coalition building. To properly test presidents' influence
on votes, researchers must simultaneously account for voting and
pre-voting processes. [A final empirically relevant point about testing
presidential influence in Congress is the relative unimportance of each
president's personal character or idiosyncratic traits]{.underline}.
Like other recent scholars, we predict that [because **[presidents'
strategic opportunities are]{.mark}** constrained, their tactical
resources are **[limited]{.mark}**]{.underline}, so all presidents will
execute more or less comparable strategies (see Cameron (2000), Edwards
(1989), Hagar and Sullivan (1994),Jones (1994), and Moe (1984, 1993)).
This is especially true for presidents' congressional relations since
all modern White House staffs include a team of Washington's most
experienced, successful legislative operatives (Collier, 1997). Thus, we
echo the growing scholarly consensus that [the presidency's
institutional incentives trump presidents' personal
characteristics]{.underline}.

## Dems Good 

### 1nc -- Democracy 

#### Dems can win midterms now with a domestic pivot in politics 

Josh **Marshall 22**, 6-6-2022, Joshua Marshall is an American
journalist and blogger writing about elections for 25 years \"Opinion,\"
No Publication,
https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/06/opinion/democrats-midterms-abortion-roe.html

[Democrats]{.underline} hope to [make November's midterm elections a
referendum on Roe v. Wade]{.underline}, the linchpin decision upholding
abortion rights, which the Supreme Court is almost certain to strike
down this summer. That strategy makes sense. Polls show [that roughly
two in three Americans oppose overturning Roe and almost 60 percent
support passing a bill to set Roe's protections in a federal
law.]{.underline} What's more, polls showed **[a rising number of voters
listing abortion as their top midterm issue]{.underline}** after news of
Roe's imminent demise leaked in the form of a draft court opinion
published by Politico. Unfortunately, their current plan is almost sure
to fail. After the Democrats came up with just 49 votes to bring a
Roe-protecting bill before the Senate on May 11, they promised to keep
fighting and, in the words of Senator Amy Klobuchar, "take that fight
right to the ballot box" in November. But you can't make an election
into a referendum on an issue if you can't point to anything winning the
election would accomplish. To make the 2022 elections a referendum on
Roe, [Democrats]{.underline} have to [put protecting Roe and abortion
rights on the table]{.underline}. Here's one way to do that: get clear
public commitments from every Senate Democrat (and candidate for Senate)
not only to vote for the Roe bill in January 2023 but also to change the
filibuster rules to ensure that a majority vote would actually pass the
bill and send it to the White House for the president's signature. At
present, there are likely 48 Senate Democrats who can make that pledge.
Senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema are dead set against any changes
to the filibuster --- a fact you likely know because most of President
Biden's agenda has been bottled up behind their refusal for the past
year. Some claim that Senators Manchin and Sinema are just taking the
public heat for a number of other Senate Democrats who are also
unwilling to change the filibuster rules. That's highly unlikely. But if
any do have misgivings, that's why the public commitments are so
important. Getting a list of holdouts down to a publicly named handful
is the first step to persuading them to fall in line. If my math is
right and there are 48 Senate Democrats ready to make that pledge, they
**[need two additional Democratic senators in the next
Congress]{.underline}**. And that is the party's message that makes the
2022 midterms a referendum on Roe: "Give us the House and two more
senators, and we will make Roe law in January 2023." The End of Roe v.
Wade Commentary by Times Opinion writers and columnists on the Supreme
Court's decision to end ​​the constitutional right to abortion. Michelle
Goldberg: "The end of Roe v. Wade was foreseen, but in wide swaths of
the country, it has still created wrenching and potentially tragic
uncertainties." Spencer Bokat-Lindell: "What exactly does it mean for
the Supreme Court to experience a crisis of legitimacy, and is it really
in one?" Bonnie Kristian, journalist: "For many backers of former
President Donald Trump, Friday's Supreme Court decision was a
long-awaited vindication." It might also mark the end of his political
career. Erika Bachiochi, legal scholar: "It is precisely the unborn
child's state of existential dependence upon its mother, not its
autonomy, that makes it especially entitled to care, nurture and legal
protection." **[No ambiguity, no haggling, no living in Senator
Manchin's head for a year]{.underline}**. You give us this, and we'll
give you that. That [tells voters exactly what will be delivered with a
Democratic win]{.underline}. It also defines what constitutes a win:
control of the House and two more Senate seats. Dig deeper into the
moment. Special offer: Subscribe for \$1 a week. The campaign message is
clear: If you want to protect Roe, give us those majorities. If this is
your passion, here's where to channel that passion. These are the Senate
seats we need to hold (in New Hampshire, Arizona, Georgia and Nevada)
and here are the ones we need to win (in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and
possibly in Ohio, Florida and North Carolina). With those commitments in
hand, one question should be on the lips of every Democratic candidate.
Will you make **[a firm commitment to never vote for a federal law
banning abortion nationwide?]{.underline}** **[Few, if any, Republicans
would be able to make that pledge]{.underline}**. And their evasions
wouldn't just make them look ridiculous; that would put squarely on the
table [the very real threat that Republicans would enact a nationwide
abortion ban as soon as January 2025]{.underline}. That could prove
enough to win Senate races in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Ohio. In a
way, though, this strategy isn't so much about winning the 2022 midterms
or even making Roe into a federal law, although it's the best way to
accomplish both. It's just an example of how you win elections**[.
Effective campaigns are built on connecting the intense beliefs of the
electorate]{.underline}** --- their hopes and fears --- **[directly to
the hard mechanics of political power]{.underline}**. You've got to
connect those wires. If you were testing some new electrical
contraption, that's the first thing you'd do: make sure the energy
supply is wired to the engine that makes it run. This is no different.
Without tying a specific electoral result to a clear commitment to a
specific legislative action after the elections, you're not connecting
those wires. What Democrats would be proposing is a classic small-c
conservative solution in the best sense of the word. Codifying Roe would
preserve the set of rights and protections that the vast majority of
Americans have lived their entire adult lives with and that the
overwhelming majority of Americans do not want to change. The threat
that the court will strike down such a law is real but overstated. And
in any case, refusing to act because of what opponents might do is the
definition of political paralysis. So how do Democrats get from here to
there? They likely can't rely on the party's leaders, at least not at
first. But they're not essential. It's really up to voters and activists
and particularly committed members of Congress. Probably half the
Democrats in the Senate would be happy to sign on this dotted line by
the end of the day. Those who are up for re-election, even in safe
races, will come around quickly. Some senators may resist at first. And
that wouldn't be surprising. Politicians seldom see any advantage to
committing themselves in advance or reducing their room for maneuver.
It's always safer to keep your options open and be as general as
possible until the final moment. That's why assembling a clear public
list of commitments is critical. Once the list gets down to a handful of
hesitaters, the pressure from Democrats nationwide, focused on those
members, will be overwhelming. If there are real holdouts, they'll fold
in short order. You don't need to wait on Nancy Pelosi or Chuck Schumer
or President Biden. You can get the ball rolling by calling up your
Democratic senator today.

#### The plan signals an unpopular international shift in democrat's priorities that undermines their path to victory. NATO security cooperation worries voters and is perceived as trading off with domestic issues that appeal more to swing voters

Bruce **Stokes 20**, 9-4-2020, \"US Electorate Shows Distrust of the
Realities of Foreign Policy,\" Chatham House -- International Affairs
Think Tank,
https://www.chathamhouse.org/2020/09/us-electorate-shows-distrust-realities-foreign-policy

Whoever occupies the White House after the election, it is evident the
emphasis will be on 'America First', and that only characteristics and
approaches will differ. If Donald Trump is re-elected, his electoral
base will support a continuation of isolationist, protectionist
policies. If Joe Biden becomes president, he will enjoy some limited
popular backing for international re-engagement, but his voters still
clearly want him to prioritize domestic issues. Implications for the
foreign policy of the next US administration are evident. America may
have a long history of isolationism, but that should not be confused
with ignorance of the growing interconnectedness of today's world.
However, **[Americans are struggling to find a new equilibrium for their
country's role in the world]{.underline}**. Around seven-in-ten hold the
view that the United States should take a leading or major role in
international affairs, and the same number acknowledge that
international events affect their daily life. But **[Americans remain
reticent about global engagement, and half of registered voters believe
other countries take unfair advantage of the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates. This clear contradiction is mirrored in what
can be expected from the election victor, with a Joe Biden
administration likely to speak for those who want America to lead, while
a second Donald Trump administration is expected to continue complaining
about US victimization by an ungrateful world. A majority (57%) of
Americans say foreign policy is 'very important' to them as they decide
who to vote for in the 2020 election. This may seem like a high
priority, but American polls often show many issues are 'very important'
to voters. What matters is relative importance and **[foreign policy
pales in comparison with the significance the public accords to the
economy (79%) or healthcare (68%).]{.underline}** Immigration (52%) and
climate change (42%) are of even less relative importance to voters.
Notably, despite the deep partisanship in American politics today,
**[there is no difference between Republican and Democrat voters on the
low priority they accord foreign policy]{.underline}**. And barely
one-third (35%) of the public give top priority to working with allies
and international institutions to confront global challenges such as
climate change, poverty and disease --- in fact only 31% say improving
relations with allies should be a top foreign policy priority over the
next five years. However, despite this apparent lack of support for
international relations, a rising majority of Americans believe
international trade is good for the economy --- running contrary to many
international assumptions that Americans are inherently protectionist.
But this increased interest may not amount to much in reality. Americans
also believe trade destroys jobs and lowers wages. Trump is clearly
wedded to a protectionist worldview and may continue to try dismantling
the World Trade Organization (WTO). Biden is unlikely to initiate any
new trade liberalizing negotiations given what would be, at best, a slim
Democratic majority in the Senate and anti-trade views held by many
unions and blue-collar voters among his constituency. Any political
capital he commits to trade is likely to focus on reforming the WTO, but
privately his advisers admit they are not optimistic. In addition, both
Biden and Trump face strong public support for ratcheting up pressure on
China, although their lines of attack may differ, with Trump likely to
double down on tariffs while Biden would work closely with Europe on
both trade and human rights issues. More broadly, almost three-quarters
(73%) of Americans now express an unfavourable view of China, up 18
points since the last presidential election. One-quarter of Americans
classify Beijing as an 'enemy' with almost half saying the US should get
tougher with China on economic issues, although attitudes do divide
along partisan lines, with Republicans generally more critical of
Beijing, but Democrats are tougher on human rights. On immigration,
Trump's policies are out of step with the public. Six-in-ten Americans
oppose expanding the border wall with Mexico, 74% support legal status
for immigrants illegally brought to the United States as children ---
including a majority of Republicans (54%) --- and as many Americans
favour increasing immigration as support decreasing it. But Trump has
already promised to double down on limiting immigration if he wins
because it is what his Republican electoral base wants and, as with
trade, this is one of his long-expressed personal beliefs. If he wins,
expect more mass roundups of undocumented people, completion of his
border wall and stricter limitations on legal immigration. In contrast,
Biden is likely to loosen constraints on immigration because he believes
immigration has been good for the economy and the Democratic party is
increasingly dependent on Hispanic and Asian voters, the two fastest
growing portions of the population. However, open borders are not a
Biden option. The US foreign-born population is at near-record levels
and, every time in American history the portion of foreign born has come
close to being 14% of the total population --- in the 1880s, the 1920s
and now --- there has been a populist backlash. Democrats cannot risk
that again. On climate change, there is strong evidence the American
public is increasingly worried, and likely to support rejoining the
Paris Agreement if Biden is elected and increases US commitments to cut
carbon emissions. But the public also appears unlikely to punish Trump
if, as promised, he leaves that accord, and he is almost certain to
continue denying climate science in the interest of the coal, oil, and
gas industries. The public's concern about global warming does not
necessarily translate into support for taking substantive action. There
is a huge partisan divide between the number of Democrats (68%) and
Republicans (11%) who say climate change is a very important issue in
the 2020 election. When pressed on what action they want on climate
change, and who they trust to do it, Americans are less likely than
Europeans to accept paying higher prices. A carbon tax stands no chance
of passing the Senate, thanks to moderate Democrats from fossil-fuel
states, and America's love affair with large, CO²-emitting vehicles
shows no signs of ebbing. The outcome of the 2020 US election will
almost certainly not be determined by foreign concerns, although an
international crisis --- a terrorist incident, a military confrontation
with China or North Korea --- could impact voting in an unforeseen way.
But given the mood of the American electorate, if Trump is re-elected,
there will be scant public pressure for a more activist, collaborative
US foreign policy, beyond support for a tough line on China, while a win
for Biden will give more room for some international initiatives. **[But
public opinion data is clear. Voters want the next US president to focus
first on domestic issues]{.underline}** --- overcoming the pandemic,
digging the country out of a deep economic hole, calming racial
tensions, and reversing inequality. The outcome of the election may end
America's recently antagonistic foreign policy and halt the
deterioration of its international role. But dramatic American
re-engagement appears unlikely as the public's priorities lie elsewhere.

#### Midterm's win for republicans means the collapse of American democracy 

Margaret **Sullivan 22**, 5-15-2022, \"Perspective,\" Washington Post,
https://www.washingtonpost.com/media/2022/05/15/democracy-midterms-vote-integrity-media-coverage/

I was mesmerized this past week by two astonishing videos, watching them
both multiple times. One showed the stunning Kentucky Derby, where the
little-known chestnut colt Rich Strike came out of nowhere to blast past
the favorites and win the race by less than a length. The other showed
an entire North Carolina beach house tumbling into the ocean, yet
another indication of Outer Banks shoreline erosion and, more generally,
the world's catastrophic climate crisis. And I couldn't help but see
both as metaphors for the [precarious state of democracy in
America]{.underline} and the news media's role in helping to save the
day or in succumbing to disaster. Here's what I mean. [Since Jan. 6 of
last year, a growing chorus of activists, historians and political
commentators have spoken of "democracy on the brink" or "democracy in
peril."]{.underline} What they mean is that, thanks to a paranoid,
delusional and potentially violent new strain in our nation's politics,
Americans may not be able to count on future elections being conducted
fairly --- or the results of fair elections being accepted. And at least
some news organizations are taking heed. The Washington Post established
a "democracy team" to expand reporting on the nationwide battles over
voting rules, access to polls, and efforts to create unfounded doubt
about the outcome of elections. At the New York Times, soon-to-be
executive editor Joe Kahn is talking frankly about the need to
investigate efforts to undermine the institutions that uphold democracy.
(If they don't, he told the Columbia Journalism Review, "we're not doing
our job as a leading news organization.") A number of regional
journalists are beginning to push against industry norms to speak more
clearly about the threat: The Philadelphia Inquirer boldly declined to
use the euphemism word "audit" to dignify state Republicans' endless
probes for nonexistent voter fraud --- essentially the GOP's attempt to
cast unwarranted doubt on the results of the 2020 election in
Pennsylvania. But the clearest recognition I've heard so far came last
week from a managing editor for CNN. Alex Koppelman is not the editor
overseeing the network's political coverage; instead, he supervises
business and media news. But CNN gave him a voice to lay out the harsh
reality of what the nation is up against, and what we in the media need
to do about it. Koppelman underscored what we should all be clear about
by now: [that most of the Republican Party publicly touts the lie that
Donald Trump won the 2020 election but that the vote was rigged and
victory stolen from him.]{.underline} The Republican **[elected
officials who won't back Trump are being driven out of office by his
faithful]{.underline}**. "Those true believers think there is no way
Trump could lose a presidential election," he wrote, "and maybe that no
Republican nominee could." **[That makes the outcome of this year's
midterm elections extraordinarily consequential]{.underline}**. If
[Republicans take]{.underline} one or [both houses of
Congress]{.underline}, and if Trump or another Trump-inspired Republican
runs for president in 2024, Koppelman added, "**[there may be no
stopping the tide."]{.underline}** These true believers will see to it
that the Republican nominee is declared the winner --- even if it takes
a coup to do so. (Let's face it: We saw that very thing attempted on
Jan. 6 last year when a violent mob stormed the Capitol and demanded the
election results be reversed.) Nor is it just about elections to
Congress. Secretary of state elections across the country may prove even
more consequential because those officials oversee elections, control
the machinery and vastly influence public opinion with their
pronouncements about the integrity of the vote. University of Michigan
law professor Barbara McQuade pointed out in a Times opinion piece that
27 states will choose a secretary of state this fall, and in 17 of those
states --- including some key electoral battlegrounds --- at least one
of the Republican candidates denies that President Biden is the
legitimate president. A Trump lawyer wrote an instruction manual for a
coup. Why haven't you seen it on the news? But do American citizens get
it? Do they fully recognize that our precious democracy may soon fall
into history's sea? If they think about it at all, have they resigned
themselves to what they consider the inevitable and not recognize that
[preserving that democracy is every bit as possible]{.underline} --- if
unlikely --- as that Churchill Downs stunner? My sense is that the news
media has to try harder --- and differently --- to get this message
across to voters, who are the only ones who can truly protect democracy.
How can news organizations do that? Is it just more of the
tried-and-true: good, solid, aggressive reporting? Or is another
approach necessary, and if so, what might that be? When I followed up by
phone with CNN's Koppelman, he suggested that newsroom leaders take the
time to ask themselves and their teams a basic question: "Does our
audience understand what the stakes of this election are?" Given the
press of daily deadlines and the constant flow of news, journalists
don't always take that step back to assess the overall impact of their
coverage. "We have to spend that time now," he told me. I've written
before about my own ideas: to make the threats to democracy a central
part of media coverage, not a sidelight; to stop treating campaigns like
so many horse races; to have coverage reflect a sharp focus on
government rather than politics; to label this coverage in a defining
and memorable way, as news organizations have done with "Spotlight" or
"Watchdog" teams in the past; to make it accessible to all by placing at
least some of the coverage in front of the paywall; to communicate with
audiences plainly and transparently about what this coverage is about
and why it's important. Those who grapple with this subject every day
could probably offer better suggestions. **[The midterm elections may be
the most consequential ones in American history.]{.underline}** They are
less than six months away, and many Americans don't understand how high
the stakes really are. There's not much time to fix that. It will
require a come-from-behind sprint like the one Rich Strike pulled off.
**[If we fail, we may see American democracy tumble into
oblivion]{.underline}** like that North Carolina beach house, never to
be seen whole again.

Institution, Senior Fellow at the Freeman Spogli Institute for

Winds: Saving Democracy from Russian Rage, Chinese Ambition, and
American Complacency, p. 199-202\]

The most obvious response to the ill winds blowing from the world's
autocracies is to help the winds of freedom blowing in the other
direction. T[he democracies of the West cannot save themselves if they
do not **stand with democrats** around the world.]{.underline}

This is truer now than ever, for several reasons. [We live in a
**[globalized world]{.mark}**, one in which models, trends, and ideas
**[cascade across borders]{.mark}**. Any wind of change may gather
quickly and blow with gale force. People everywhere form ideas about how
to govern]{.underline}---or simply about which forms of government and
sources of power may be irresistible---[based on what they **see
happening elsewhere**. We are now immersed in a fierce global contest of
ideas, information, and norms]{.underline}. In the digital age, that
contest is moving at lightning speed, shaping how people think about
their political systems and the way the world runs. [As doubts about and
threats to democracy are mounting in the West, this is [**not a
contest** that the **democracies can afford to
lose.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Globalization]{.underline}, with its flows of trade and information,
[raises the stakes for us in another way. **Authoritarian** and badly
governed regimes increasingly pose a [**direct threat** to **popular
sovereignty**]{.mark} and the rule of law in our own
democracies]{.underline}. Covert flows of money and influence are
subverting and corrupting our democratic processes and institutions.
They will not stop just because Americans and others pretend that we
have no stake in the future of freedom in the world. If we want to
defend the core principles of self-government, transparency, and
accountability in our own democracies, we have no choice but to promote
them globally.

[It is not enough to say that dictatorship is bad and that democracy,
however flawed, is still better. Popular enthusiasm for a lesser]{.mark}
evil cannot be sustained indefinitely. People need the inspiration of a
positive vision. Democracy must demonstrate that it is a just and fair
political system that advances humane values and the common good.

To make our republics more perfect, established democracies must not
only adopt reforms to more fully include and empower their own citizens.
They must also support people, groups, and institutions struggling to
achieve democratic values elsewhere. The best way to counter Russian
rage and Chinese ambition is to show that Moscow and Beijing are on the
wrong side of history; that people everywhere yearn to be free; and that
they can make freedom work to achieve a more just, sustainable, and
prosperous society.

In our networked age, both [idealism and the harder imperatives of
global power and security argue for **more democracy**, not
less]{.underline}. For one thing, if we do not worry about the quality
of governance in lower-income countries, we will face more and more
troubled and failing states. Famine and genocide are the curse of
authoritarian states, not democratic ones. Outright state collapse is
the ultimate, bitter fruit of tyranny. When countries like Syria, Libya,
and Afghanistan descend into civil war; when poor states in Africa
cannot generate jobs and improve their citizens' lives due to rule by
corrupt and callous strongmen; when Central American societies are held
hostage by brutal gangs and kleptocratic rulers, people flee---and wash
up on the shores of the democracies. Europe and the United States cannot
withstand the rising pressures of immigration unless they work to
support better, more stable and accountable government in troubled
countries. The world has simply grown too small, too flat, and too fast
to wall off rotten states and pretend they are on some other planet.

[**[Hard security interests]{.mark}** are at stake]{.underline}. As even
the Trump administration's 2017 National Security Strategy makes clear,
[the main threats to U.S. national security all stem from
authoritarianism, whether in the form of tyrannies from
**[Russia]{.mark}** and **[China]{.mark}** to **[Iran]{.mark}** and
**[No]{.mark}rth [Ko]{.mark}rea** or in the guise of antidemocratic
terrorist movements such as **[ISIS]{.mark}**]{.underline}.1 [By
supporting the development of democracy around the world, we can
[**deny** these **authoritarian adversaries** the **geopolitical running
room**]{.mark} they seek. Just as Russia, China, and Iran are trying to
undermine democracies to bend other countries to their will, so too can
we contain these autocrats' ambitions]{.underline} by helping other
countries build effective, resilient democracies that can withstand the
dictators' malevolence.

Of course, [**democratically** elected governments with **open
societies** will **not support** the American line on every issue. But
no free society wants to mortgage its **future** to another country. The
American national interest would best be **secured** by a **pluralistic
world** of **free countries**]{.underline}---[one in which autocrats can
no longer use corruption and coercion to gobble up **resources**,
**alliances**, and **territory**.]{.underline}

[If you look back over our history to see who has posed a threat to the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and our allies, it has always
been **authoritarian regimes** and empires. As political scientists have
long noted, [**no two democracies** have ever gone to war with each
othe]{.mark}r]{.underline}---[**ever**. It is not the democracies of the
world that are supporting international **[terrorism]{.mark}**,
[prolif]{.mark}erating **w**eapons of **m**ass **d**estruction, or
[**threatening** the **territory**]{.mark} of their

### 1nc -- Climate 

#### Dems can win midterms now with a domestic pivot in politics 

Josh **Marshall 22**, 6-6-2022, Joshua Marshall is an American
journalist and blogger writing about elections for 25 years \"Opinion,\"
No Publication,
https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/06/opinion/democrats-midterms-abortion-roe.html

[Democrats]{.underline} hope to [make November's midterm elections a
referendum on Roe v. Wade]{.underline}, the linchpin decision upholding
abortion rights, which the Supreme Court is almost certain to strike
down this summer. That strategy makes sense. Polls show [that roughly
two in three Americans oppose overturning Roe and almost 60 percent
support passing a bill to set Roe's protections in a federal
law.]{.underline} What's more, polls showed **[a rising number of voters
listing abortion as their top midterm issue]{.underline}** after news of
Roe's imminent demise leaked in the form of a draft court opinion
published by Politico. Unfortunately, their current plan is almost sure
to fail. After the Democrats came up with just 49 votes to bring a
Roe-protecting bill before the Senate on May 11, they promised to keep
fighting and, in the words of Senator Amy Klobuchar, "take that fight
right to the ballot box" in November. But you can't make an election
into a referendum on an issue if you can't point to anything winning the
election would accomplish. To make the 2022 elections a referendum on
Roe, [Democrats]{.underline} have to [put protecting Roe and abortion
rights on the table]{.underline}. Here's one way to do that: get clear
public commitments from every Senate Democrat (and candidate for Senate)
not only to vote for the Roe bill in January 2023 but also to change the
filibuster rules to ensure that a majority vote would actually pass the
bill and send it to the White House for the president's signature. At
present, there are likely 48 Senate Democrats who can make that pledge.
Senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema are dead set against any changes
to the filibuster --- a fact you likely know because most of President
Biden's agenda has been bottled up behind their refusal for the past
year. Some claim that Senators Manchin and Sinema are just taking the
public heat for a number of other Senate Democrats who are also
unwilling to change the filibuster rules. That's highly unlikely. But if
any do have misgivings, that's why the public commitments are so
important. Getting a list of holdouts down to a publicly named handful
is the first step to persuading them to fall in line. If my math is
right and there are 48 Senate Democrats ready to make that pledge, they
**[need two additional Democratic senators in the next
Congress]{.underline}**. And that is the party's message that makes the
2022 midterms a referendum on Roe: "Give us the House and two more
senators, and we will make Roe law in January 2023." The End of Roe v.
Wade Commentary by Times Opinion writers and columnists on the Supreme
Court's decision to end ​​the constitutional right to abortion. Michelle
Goldberg: "The end of Roe v. Wade was foreseen, but in wide swaths of
the country, it has still created wrenching and potentially tragic
uncertainties." Spencer Bokat-Lindell: "What exactly does it mean for
the Supreme Court to experience a crisis of legitimacy, and is it really
in one?" Bonnie Kristian, journalist: "For many backers of former
President Donald Trump, Friday's Supreme Court decision was a
long-awaited vindication." It might also mark the end of his political
career. Erika Bachiochi, legal scholar: "It is precisely the unborn
child's state of existential dependence upon its mother, not its
autonomy, that makes it especially entitled to care, nurture and legal
protection." **[No ambiguity, no haggling, no living in Senator
Manchin's head for a year]{.underline}**. You give us this, and we'll
give you that. That [tells voters exactly what will be delivered with a
Democratic win]{.underline}. It also defines what constitutes a win:
control of the House and two more Senate seats. Dig deeper into the
moment. Special offer: Subscribe for \$1 a week. The campaign message is
clear: If you want to protect Roe, give us those majorities. If this is
your passion, here's where to channel that passion. These are the Senate
seats we need to hold (in New Hampshire, Arizona, Georgia and Nevada)
and here are the ones we need to win (in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and
possibly in Ohio, Florida and North Carolina). With those commitments in
hand, one question should be on the lips of every Democratic candidate.
Will you make **[a firm commitment to never vote for a federal law
banning abortion nationwide?]{.underline}** **[Few, if any, Republicans
would be able to make that pledge]{.underline}**. And their evasions
wouldn't just make them look ridiculous; that would put squarely on the
table [the very real threat that Republicans would enact a nationwide
abortion ban as soon as January 2025]{.underline}. That could prove
enough to win Senate races in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Ohio. In a
way, though, this strategy isn't so much about winning the 2022 midterms
or even making Roe into a federal law, although it's the best way to
accomplish both. It's just an example of how you win elections**[.
Effective campaigns are built on connecting the intense beliefs of the
electorate]{.underline}** --- their hopes and fears --- **[directly to
the hard mechanics of political power]{.underline}**. You've got to
connect those wires. If you were testing some new electrical
contraption, that's the first thing you'd do: make sure the energy
supply is wired to the engine that makes it run. This is no different.
Without tying a specific electoral result to a clear commitment to a
specific legislative action after the elections, you're not connecting
those wires. What Democrats would be proposing is a classic small-c
conservative solution in the best sense of the word. Codifying Roe would
preserve the set of rights and protections that the vast majority of
Americans have lived their entire adult lives with and that the
overwhelming majority of Americans do not want to change. The threat
that the court will strike down such a law is real but overstated. And
in any case, refusing to act because of what opponents might do is the
definition of political paralysis. So how do Democrats get from here to
there? They likely can't rely on the party's leaders, at least not at
first. But they're not essential. It's really up to voters and activists
and particularly committed members of Congress. Probably half the
Democrats in the Senate would be happy to sign on this dotted line by
the end of the day. Those who are up for re-election, even in safe
races, will come around quickly. Some senators may resist at first. And
that wouldn't be surprising. Politicians seldom see any advantage to
committing themselves in advance or reducing their room for maneuver.
It's always safer to keep your options open and be as general as
possible until the final moment. That's why assembling a clear public
list of commitments is critical. Once the list gets down to a handful of
hesitaters, the pressure from Democrats nationwide, focused on those
members, will be overwhelming. If there are real holdouts, they'll fold
in short order. You don't need to wait on Nancy Pelosi or Chuck Schumer
or President Biden. You can get the ball rolling by calling up your
Democratic senator today.

#### The plan signals an unpopular international shift in democrat's priorities that undermines their path to victory. NATO security cooperation worries voters and is perceived as trading off with domestic issues that appeal more to swing voters

Bruce **Stokes 20**, 9-4-2020, \"US Electorate Shows Distrust of the
Realities of Foreign Policy,\" Chatham House -- International Affairs
Think Tank,
https://www.chathamhouse.org/2020/09/us-electorate-shows-distrust-realities-foreign-policy

Whoever occupies the White House after the election, it is evident the
emphasis will be on 'America First', and that only characteristics and
approaches will differ. If Donald Trump is re-elected, his electoral
base will support a continuation of isolationist, protectionist
policies. If Joe Biden becomes president, he will enjoy some limited
popular backing for international re-engagement, but his voters still
clearly want him to prioritize domestic issues. Implications for the
foreign policy of the next US administration are evident. America may
have a long history of isolationism, but that should not be confused
with ignorance of the growing interconnectedness of today's world.
However, **[Americans are struggling to find a new equilibrium for their
country's role in the world]{.underline}**. Around seven-in-ten hold the
view that the United States should take a leading or major role in
international affairs, and the same number acknowledge that
international events affect their daily life. But **[Americans remain
reticent about global engagement, and half of registered voters believe
other countries take unfair advantage of the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates. This clear contradiction is mirrored in what
can be expected from the election victor, with a Joe Biden
administration likely to speak for those who want America to lead, while
a second Donald Trump administration is expected to continue complaining
about US victimization by an ungrateful world. A majority (57%) of
Americans say foreign policy is 'very important' to them as they decide
who to vote for in the 2020 election. This may seem like a high
priority, but American polls often show many issues are 'very important'
to voters. What matters is relative importance and **[foreign policy
pales in comparison with the significance the public accords to the
economy (79%) or healthcare (68%).]{.underline}** Immigration (52%) and
climate change (42%) are of even less relative importance to voters.
Notably, despite the deep partisanship in American politics today,
**[there is no difference between Republican and Democrat voters on the
low priority they accord foreign policy]{.underline}**. And barely
one-third (35%) of the public give top priority to working with allies
and international institutions to confront global challenges such as
climate change, poverty and disease --- in fact only 31% say improving
relations with allies should be a top foreign policy priority over the
next five years. However, despite this apparent lack of support for
international relations, a rising majority of Americans believe
international trade is good for the economy --- running contrary to many
international assumptions that Americans are inherently protectionist.
But this increased interest may not amount to much in reality. Americans
also believe trade destroys jobs and lowers wages. Trump is clearly
wedded to a protectionist worldview and may continue to try dismantling
the World Trade Organization (WTO). Biden is unlikely to initiate any
new trade liberalizing negotiations given what would be, at best, a slim
Democratic majority in the Senate and anti-trade views held by many
unions and blue-collar voters among his constituency. Any political
capital he commits to trade is likely to focus on reforming the WTO, but
privately his advisers admit they are not optimistic. In addition, both
Biden and Trump face strong public support for ratcheting up pressure on
China, although their lines of attack may differ, with Trump likely to
double down on tariffs while Biden would work closely with Europe on
both trade and human rights issues. More broadly, almost three-quarters
(73%) of Americans now express an unfavourable view of China, up 18
points since the last presidential election. One-quarter of Americans
classify Beijing as an 'enemy' with almost half saying the US should get
tougher with China on economic issues, although attitudes do divide
along partisan lines, with Republicans generally more critical of
Beijing, but Democrats are tougher on human rights. On immigration,
Trump's policies are out of step with the public. Six-in-ten Americans
oppose expanding the border wall with Mexico, 74% support legal status
for immigrants illegally brought to the United States as children ---
including a majority of Republicans (54%) --- and as many Americans
favour increasing immigration as support decreasing it. But Trump has
already promised to double down on limiting immigration if he wins
because it is what his Republican electoral base wants and, as with
trade, this is one of his long-expressed personal beliefs. If he wins,
expect more mass roundups of undocumented people, completion of his
border wall and stricter limitations on legal immigration. In contrast,
Biden is likely to loosen constraints on immigration because he believes
immigration has been good for the economy and the Democratic party is
increasingly dependent on Hispanic and Asian voters, the two fastest
growing portions of the population. However, open borders are not a
Biden option. The US foreign-born population is at near-record levels
and, every time in American history the portion of foreign born has come
close to being 14% of the total population --- in the 1880s, the 1920s
and now --- there has been a populist backlash. Democrats cannot risk
that again. On climate change, there is strong evidence the American
public is increasingly worried, and likely to support rejoining the
Paris Agreement if Biden is elected and increases US commitments to cut
carbon emissions. But the public also appears unlikely to punish Trump
if, as promised, he leaves that accord, and he is almost certain to
continue denying climate science in the interest of the coal, oil, and
gas industries. The public's concern about global warming does not
necessarily translate into support for taking substantive action. There
is a huge partisan divide between the number of Democrats (68%) and
Republicans (11%) who say climate change is a very important issue in
the 2020 election. When pressed on what action they want on climate
change, and who they trust to do it, Americans are less likely than
Europeans to accept paying higher prices. A carbon tax stands no chance
of passing the Senate, thanks to moderate Democrats from fossil-fuel
states, and America's love affair with large, CO²-emitting vehicles
shows no signs of ebbing. The outcome of the 2020 US election will
almost certainly not be determined by foreign concerns, although an
international crisis --- a terrorist incident, a military confrontation
with China or North Korea --- could impact voting in an unforeseen way.
But given the mood of the American electorate, if Trump is re-elected,
there will be scant public pressure for a more activist, collaborative
US foreign policy, beyond support for a tough line on China, while a win
for Biden will give more room for some international initiatives. **[But
public opinion data is clear. Voters want the next US president to focus
first on domestic issues]{.underline}** --- overcoming the pandemic,
digging the country out of a deep economic hole, calming racial
tensions, and reversing inequality. The outcome of the election may end
America's recently antagonistic foreign policy and halt the
deterioration of its international role. But dramatic American
re-engagement appears unlikely as the public's priorities lie elsewhere.

#### EPA ruling drastically limited executive power in climate action \-- means only dem controlled senate can solve climate change 

Daniel **Sherrell 22**, 7-5-2022, \"Democrats have a month to revive the
climate deal our planet needs,\"

On Thursday, [the supreme court of the United States struck down the
EPA's Clean Power Plan, sharply limiting the federal government's
ability to fight climate change.]{.underline} The US supreme court has
declared war on the Earth's future Kate Aronoff Read more With
**[Earth's temperature rising steadily]{.underline}**, with [the
scientific community shouting at the top of its lungs for more
aggressive action, with fires and hurricanes pushing entire regions
beyond the bounds of human habitability, the court's
Republican-appointed supermajority has chosen to actively inhibit our
ability to respond to the crisis.]{.underline} The decision was in
keeping with the Republican party's deepening climate nihilism: as the
train careens off the rails, they strangle the conductor, destroy the
brakes. Though it's been subtext since the advent of Maga, it is worth
stating plainly what this ruling makes obvious: there is a death drive
animating the modern conservative movement. It is merciless and strange
and remarkably consistent. It stands on the side of whatever makes our
country poorer, greedier, less safe and more desperate. It deregulates
firearms after a massacre at an elementary school. **[It deregulates
carbon after experts issue a "code red for humanity".]{.underline}** It
forces mothers to bring their children to term, and then abandons those
children to bullets, to wildfires, to grinding, generational poverty.
Its pro-life policies seem to reverse precisely at the moment of birth.
When it comes to living children, conservatism is a pro-death movement.
Advertisement After the court gutted the EPA, conservative leaders
celebrated it as a win for democracy. Mitch McConnell argued that [it
had given "power back to the people" by]{.underline} wresting climate
policy from the hands of "unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats" and
**[investing it in Congress alone.]{.underline}** The irony could not be
more acute. Nevermind that "the people" -- [60% of Americans by one
recent estimate -- actively support the EPA regulating carbon
emissions.]{.underline} Never mind that the decision was issued by an
unelected, unaccountable court with no claim to democratic legitimacy
(the Republican supermajority having taken shape over an era in which
Democrats won the popular vote in eight of nine presidential elections).
The point is that Mitch McConnell has spent decades systematically
eroding Congress's ability to legislate -- not just on climate, but on
almost anything at all. With the court deferring to Congress, Congress
hog-tied by the filibuster and the White House stripped of its main
administrative recourse, control of our nation's climate policy falls to
exactly those conservative donors -- many with ties to the fossil fuel
industry -- who helped drive the nomination and confirmation of the
current Republican bench. They are the only people on the planet who
profit from seeing it burn. Their interests are in perfect opposition to
those of the public. And when it comes to the most consequential
challenge of the 21st century, the supreme court they hired is clearing
a path for them to rule by default. It would be a mistake to dismiss
this as pure, self-dealing avarice. To at least some of the conservative
stalwarts who spent decades orchestrating the decision, it represents a
sincere vision of the good. The richest people in the world, loosed from
the bounds of expertise, oversight or electoral accountability, imposing
their will on a prostrate public. It is a clean, satisfying system. It
activates something deep in the amygdala, a slavering, animal need for
dominion. This is the animating spirit of the court's decision: an old
ethic of might makes right, something much closer to Friedrich Nietzsche
than to Jesus Christ. Nietzsche memorably referred to Christianity --
with its exhortations to mercy and selflessness --as a slave's religion.
Justices Alito, Barrett, Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, Roberts and Thomas appear
to have agreed. Why let the meek inherit the Earth, when you can make so
much money burning it? Their nihilism has left the rest of us, the
proverbial meek, increasingly desperate. Our ability to maintain a safe
climate now rests on the Democrats passing clean energy investments
through congressional budget reconciliation. They only have about five
weeks left to do it. This will be the defining moment of Joe Biden and
Chuck Schumer's political careers. They cannot waffle. They cannot get
distracted. They cannot take two weeks to digest the ruling. Their best
people should be working around the clock to [land a climate deal that
can pass the Senate.]{.underline} In the glare of history, [failure on
climate will overshadow any other fact about their tenure.]{.underline}
Let's hope they feel the heat as much as we do.

#### Warming leads to extinction\-\--it's a conflict-multiplier and defense doesn't assume non-linearity

University, director of the Institute of the Environment and
Sustainability at UCLA, Pritzker Distinguished Professor in Environment

ecosystem collapse: Nature strikes back," *Futures*, 102)

In summary, six of the nine proposed planetary boundaries (phosphorous,
nitrogen, biodiversity, land use, atmospheric aerosol loading, and
chemical pollution) are unlikely to be associated with existential
risks. They all correspond to a degraded environment, but in our
assessment do not represent existential risks. However, the three
remaining boundaries ([[climate]{.mark} [change]{.mark}, global
freshwater cycle, [and]{.mark} ocean
[acidification]{.mark}]{.underline}) do [[pose **existential
risks**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[This is]{.mark} [because of]{.mark}
intrinsic **[positive feedback loops]{.mark}**]{.underline}, substantial
lag times between system change and experiencing the consequences of
that change, [[and]{.mark} the fact these different boundaries interact
with one another in ways that yield **[surprises]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
In addition, [[climate]{.mark}, freshwater, [and]{.mark} ocean
[acidification are]{.mark} all [directly connected to]{.mark} the

[shortages]{.mark}]{.underline} of food and water can [[create

a long history of disrupting civilizations and sometimes precipitating
the collapse of cultures or mass emigrations (McMichael, 2017). For
example, the 12th century drought in the North American Southwest is
held responsible for the collapse of the Anasazi pueblo culture. More
recently, the infamous potato famine of 1846--1849 and the large
migration of Irish to the U.S. can be traced to a combination of
factors, one of which was climate. Specifically, 1846 was an unusually
warm and moist year in Ireland, providing the climatic conditions
favorable to the fungus that caused the potato blight. As is so often
the case, poor government had a role as well---as the British government
forbade the import of grains from outside Britain (imports that could
have helped to redress the ravaged potato yields). [[Climate]{.mark}
[change]{.mark} intersects with freshwater resources because it [is
expected to **exacerbate**]{.mark} **drought** and]{.underline}
[**[water scarcity]{.mark}**,]{.underline} as well as flooding. Climate
change can even impair water quality because it is associated with heavy
rains that overwhelm sewage treatment facilities, or because it results
in higher concentrations of pollutants in groundwater as a result of
enhanced evaporation and reduced groundwater recharge. [[Ample clean
water]{.underline}]{.mark} is not a luxury---it [[is essential for human
survival]{.mark}.]{.underline} Consequently, cities, regions and nations
that lack clean freshwater are vulnerable to social disruption and
disease. Finally, ocean acidification is linked to climate change
because it is driven by CO2 emissions just as global warming is. With
close to 20% of the world's protein coming from oceans (FAO, 2016), the
potential for severe impacts due to acidification is obvious. Less
obvious, but perhaps more insidious, is the interaction between climate
change and the loss of oyster and coral reefs due to acidification.
Acidification is known to interfere with oyster reef building and coral
reefs. [[Climate change]{.mark} also [increases **storm**]{.mark}
**[frequency]{.mark}** and severity. Coral reefs and oyster reefs
provide protection from storm surge because they reduce wave
energy]{.underline} (Spalding et al., 2014). [If these reefs are lost
due to acidification at the same time as storms become more severe and
sea level rises]{.underline}, **[[coastal communities will be]{.mark}
[exposed to unprecedented storm surge]{.mark}]{.underline}**---[and may
be ravaged by recurrent storms]{.underline}. A key feature of the risk
associated with climate change is that mean annual temperature and mean
annual rainfall are not the variables of interest. Rather it is extreme
episodic events that place nations and entire regions of the world at
risk. These extreme events are by definition "rare" (once every hundred
years), and changes in their likelihood are challenging to detect
because of their rarity, but are exactly the manifestations of climate
change that we must get better at anticipating (Diffenbaugh et al.,
2017). [[Society will have a hard time responding to shorter intervals
between]{.mark} rare **[extreme events]{.mark}**]{.underline} because in
the lifespan of an individual human, a person might experience as few as
two or three extreme events. How likely is it that you would notice a
change in the interval between events that are separated by decades,
especially given that the interval is not regular but varies
stochastically? A concrete example of this dilemma can be found in the
past and expected future changes in storm-related flooding of New York
City. The highly disruptive flooding of New York City associated with
Hurricane Sandy represented a flood height that occurred once every 500
years in the 18th century, and that occurs now once [every 25 years, but
is expected to occur once every 5 years by 2050]{.underline} (Garner et
al., 2017). This change in frequency of extreme floods has profound
implications for the measures New York City should take to protect its
infrastructure and its population, yet because of the stochastic nature
of such events, this shift in flood frequency is an elevated risk that
will go unnoticed by most people. 4. The combination of positive
feedback loops and societal inertia is fertile ground for global
environmental catastrophes [[Humans]{.mark} are remarkably ingenious,
and [have **adapted**]{.mark} to crises [throughout]{.mark} their
[history]{.mark}]{.underline}. Our doom has been repeatedly predicted,
only to be averted by innovation (Ridley, 2011). [[However]{.mark}, the
many [stories of]{.mark} human ingenuity [successfully addressing
existential risks]{.mark}]{.underline} such as global famine or extreme
air pollution [[represent]{.mark} environmental [challenges that are
largely linear, have immediate]{.mark} [consequences, and operate
without positive feedbacks]{.mark}.]{.underline} For example, the fact
that food is in short supply does not increase the rate at which humans
consume food---thereby increasing the shortage. Similarly, massive air
pollution episodes such as the London fog of 1952 that killed 12,000
people did not make future air pollution events more likely. In fact it
was just the opposite---the London fog sent such a clear message that
Britain quickly enacted pollution control measures (Stradling, 2016).
Food shortages, air pollution, water pollution, etc. send immediate
signals to society of harm, which then trigger a negative feedback of
society seeking to reduce the harm. In contrast, today's great
environmental crisis of climate change may cause some harm but there are
generally long time delays between rising CO2 concentrations and damage
to humans. The consequence of these delays are an absence of urgency;
thus although 70% of Americans believe global warming is happening, only
40% think it will harm them
(http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/visualizations-data/ycom-us-2016/).
Secondly, [unlike past environmental challenges, **the Earth's
[climate]{.mark} system [is rife with positive feedback
loops]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [In particular, as CO2 increases and the
climate warms, that very [warming can cause more CO2]{.mark}
[release]{.mark} which further increases global warming, and then more
CO2, and so on]{.underline}. Table 2 summarizes the best documented
positive feedback loops for the Earth's climate system. These feedbacks
can be neatly categorized into carbon cycle, biogeochemical,
biogeophysical, cloud, ice-albedo, and water vapor feedbacks. As
important as it is to understand these feedbacks individually, it is
even more essential to study the interactive nature of these feedbacks.
Modeling studies show that when interactions among feedback loops are
included, uncertainty increases dramatically and there is a heightened
potential for perturbations to be magnified (e.g., Cox, Betts, Jones,
Spall, & Totterdell, 2000; Hajima, Tachiiri, Ito, & Kawamiya, 2014;
Knutti & Rugenstein, 2015; Rosenfeld, Sherwood, Wood, & Donner, 2014).
This produces a wide range of future scenarios. Positive feedbacks in
the carbon cycle involves the enhancement of future carbon contributions
to the atmosphere due to some initial increase in atmospheric CO2. This
happens because as CO2 accumulates, it reduces the efficiency in which
oceans and terrestrial ecosystems sequester carbon, which in return
feeds back to exacerbate climate change (Friedlingstein et al., 2001).
Warming can also increase the rate at which organic matter decays and
carbon is released into the atmosphere, thereby causing more warming
(Melillo et al., 2017). Increases in food shortages and lack of water is
also of major concern when biogeophysical feedback mechanisms perpetuate
drought conditions. The underlying mechanism here is that losses in
vegetation increases the surface albedo, which suppresses rainfall, and
thus enhances future vegetation loss and more suppression of
rainfall---thereby initiating or prolonging a drought (Chamey, Stone, &
Quirk, 1975). To top it off, overgrazing depletes the soil, leading to
augmented vegetation loss (Anderies, Janssen, & Walker, 2002). Climate
change often also increases the risk of forest fires, as a result of
higher temperatures and persistent drought conditions. [The expectation
is that [forest fires will become more]{.mark} [frequent]{.mark} and
severe with climate warming and drought]{.underline} (Scholze, Knorr,
Arnell, & Prentice, 2006), a trend for which we have already seen
evidence (Allen et al., 2010). Tragically, the increased severity and
risk of Southern California wildfires recently predicted by climate
scientists (Jin et al., 2015), was realized in December 2017, with the
largest fire in the history of California (the "Thomas fire" that burned
282,000 acres,
https://www.vox.com/2017/12/27/16822180/thomas-fire-california-largest-wildfire).
[This [catastrophic fire]{.mark} embodies the sorts of positive
feedbacks and interacting factors that [could **catch humanity
off-guard**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[and produce a]{.mark} true
**[apocalyptic event]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Record-breaking rains
produced an extraordinary flush of new vegetation, that then dried out
as record heat waves and dry conditions took hold, coupled with stronger
than normal winds, and ignition. Of course the record-fire released CO2
into the atmosphere, thereby contributing to future warming. Out of all
types of feedbacks, water vapor and the ice-albedo feedbacks are the
most clearly understood mechanisms. Losses in reflective snow and ice
cover drive up surface temperatures, leading to even more melting of
snow and ice cover---this is known as the ice-albedo feedback (Curry,
Schramm, & Ebert, 1995). As snow and ice continue to melt at a more
rapid pace, millions of people may be displaced by flooding risks as a
consequence of sea level rise near coastal communities (Biermann & Boas,
2010; Myers, 2002; Nicholls et al., 2011). The water vapor feedback
operates when warmer atmospheric conditions strengthen the saturation
vapor pressure, which creates a warming effect given water vapor's
strong greenhouse gas properties (Manabe & Wetherald, 1967). Global
warming tends to increase cloud formation because warmer temperatures
lead to more evaporation of water into the atmosphere, and warmer
temperature also allows the atmosphere to hold more water. The key
question is whether this increase in clouds associated with global
warming will result in a positive feedback loop (more warming) or a
negative feedback loop (less warming). For decades, scientists have
sought to answer this question and understand the net role clouds play
in future climate projections (Schneider et al., 2017). Clouds are
complex because they both have a cooling (reflecting incoming solar
radiation) and warming (absorbing incoming solar radiation) effect
(Lashof, DeAngelo, Saleska, & Harte, 1997). The type of cloud, altitude,
and optical properties combine to determine how these countervailing
effects balance out. Although still under debate, it appears that in
most circumstances the cloud feedback is likely positive (Boucher et
al., 2013). For example, models and observations show that increasing
greenhouse gas concentrations reduces the low-level cloud fraction in
the Northeast Pacific at decadal time scales. This then has a positive
feedback effect and enhances climate warming since less solar radiation
is reflected by the atmosphere (Clement, Burgman, & Norris, 2009). [The
key lesson from the long list of potentially positive feedbacks and
their interactions is that]{.underline} [**[runaway climate
change]{.mark}**, and runaway perturbations have to be taken as a
serious possibility]{.underline}. Table 2 is just a snapshot of the type
of feedbacks that have been identified (see Supplementary material for a
more thorough explanation of positive feedback loops). However, [this
list is not exhaustive and the possibility of undiscovered positive
feedbacks [portends]{.mark} **even greater [existential
risk]{.mark}s**]{.underline}. The many environmental crises humankind
has previously averted (famine, ozone depletion, London fog, water
pollution, etc.) were averted because of political will based on solid
scientific understanding. We cannot count on complete scientific
understanding when it comes to positive feedback loops and climate
change.

### 1nc -- tech leadership 

#### Dems can win midterms now with a domestic pivot in politics 

Josh **Marshall 22**, 6-6-2022, Joshua Marshall is an American
journalist and blogger writing about elections for 25 years \"Opinion,\"
No Publication,
https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/06/opinion/democrats-midterms-abortion-roe.html

[Democrats]{.underline} hope to [make November's midterm elections a
referendum on Roe v. Wade]{.underline}, the linchpin decision upholding
abortion rights, which the Supreme Court is almost certain to strike
down this summer. That strategy makes sense. Polls show [that roughly
two in three Americans oppose overturning Roe and almost 60 percent
support passing a bill to set Roe's protections in a federal
law.]{.underline} What's more, polls showed **[a rising number of voters
listing abortion as their top midterm issue]{.underline}** after news of
Roe's imminent demise leaked in the form of a draft court opinion
published by Politico. Unfortunately, their current plan is almost sure
to fail. After the Democrats came up with just 49 votes to bring a
Roe-protecting bill before the Senate on May 11, they promised to keep
fighting and, in the words of Senator Amy Klobuchar, "take that fight
right to the ballot box" in November. But you can't make an election
into a referendum on an issue if you can't point to anything winning the
election would accomplish. To make the 2022 elections a referendum on
Roe, [Democrats]{.underline} have to [put protecting Roe and abortion
rights on the table]{.underline}. Here's one way to do that: get clear
public commitments from every Senate Democrat (and candidate for Senate)
not only to vote for the Roe bill in January 2023 but also to change the
filibuster rules to ensure that a majority vote would actually pass the
bill and send it to the White House for the president's signature. At
present, there are likely 48 Senate Democrats who can make that pledge.
Senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema are dead set against any changes
to the filibuster --- a fact you likely know because most of President
Biden's agenda has been bottled up behind their refusal for the past
year. Some claim that Senators Manchin and Sinema are just taking the
public heat for a number of other Senate Democrats who are also
unwilling to change the filibuster rules. That's highly unlikely. But if
any do have misgivings, that's why the public commitments are so
important. Getting a list of holdouts down to a publicly named handful
is the first step to persuading them to fall in line. If my math is
right and there are 48 Senate Democrats ready to make that pledge, they
**[need two additional Democratic senators in the next
Congress]{.underline}**. And that is the party's message that makes the
2022 midterms a referendum on Roe: "Give us the House and two more
senators, and we will make Roe law in January 2023." The End of Roe v.
Wade Commentary by Times Opinion writers and columnists on the Supreme
Court's decision to end ​​the constitutional right to abortion. Michelle
Goldberg: "The end of Roe v. Wade was foreseen, but in wide swaths of
the country, it has still created wrenching and potentially tragic
uncertainties." Spencer Bokat-Lindell: "What exactly does it mean for
the Supreme Court to experience a crisis of legitimacy, and is it really
in one?" Bonnie Kristian, journalist: "For many backers of former
President Donald Trump, Friday's Supreme Court decision was a
long-awaited vindication." It might also mark the end of his political
career. Erika Bachiochi, legal scholar: "It is precisely the unborn
child's state of existential dependence upon its mother, not its
autonomy, that makes it especially entitled to care, nurture and legal
protection." **[No ambiguity, no haggling, no living in Senator
Manchin's head for a year]{.underline}**. You give us this, and we'll
give you that. That [tells voters exactly what will be delivered with a
Democratic win]{.underline}. It also defines what constitutes a win:
control of the House and two more Senate seats. Dig deeper into the
moment. Special offer: Subscribe for \$1 a week. The campaign message is
clear: If you want to protect Roe, give us those majorities. If this is
your passion, here's where to channel that passion. These are the Senate
seats we need to hold (in New Hampshire, Arizona, Georgia and Nevada)
and here are the ones we need to win (in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and
possibly in Ohio, Florida and North Carolina). With those commitments in
hand, one question should be on the lips of every Democratic candidate.
Will you make **[a firm commitment to never vote for a federal law
banning abortion nationwide?]{.underline}** **[Few, if any, Republicans
would be able to make that pledge]{.underline}**. And their evasions
wouldn't just make them look ridiculous; that would put squarely on the
table [the very real threat that Republicans would enact a nationwide
abortion ban as soon as January 2025]{.underline}. That could prove
enough to win Senate races in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Ohio. In a
way, though, this strategy isn't so much about winning the 2022 midterms
or even making Roe into a federal law, although it's the best way to
accomplish both. It's just an example of how you win elections**[.
Effective campaigns are built on connecting the intense beliefs of the
electorate]{.underline}** --- their hopes and fears --- **[directly to
the hard mechanics of political power]{.underline}**. You've got to
connect those wires. If you were testing some new electrical
contraption, that's the first thing you'd do: make sure the energy
supply is wired to the engine that makes it run. This is no different.
Without tying a specific electoral result to a clear commitment to a
specific legislative action after the elections, you're not connecting
those wires. What Democrats would be proposing is a classic small-c
conservative solution in the best sense of the word. Codifying Roe would
preserve the set of rights and protections that the vast majority of
Americans have lived their entire adult lives with and that the
overwhelming majority of Americans do not want to change. The threat
that the court will strike down such a law is real but overstated. And
in any case, refusing to act because of what opponents might do is the
definition of political paralysis. So how do Democrats get from here to
there? They likely can't rely on the party's leaders, at least not at
first. But they're not essential. It's really up to voters and activists
and particularly committed members of Congress. Probably half the
Democrats in the Senate would be happy to sign on this dotted line by
the end of the day. Those who are up for re-election, even in safe
races, will come around quickly. Some senators may resist at first. And
that wouldn't be surprising. Politicians seldom see any advantage to
committing themselves in advance or reducing their room for maneuver.
It's always safer to keep your options open and be as general as
possible until the final moment. That's why assembling a clear public
list of commitments is critical. Once the list gets down to a handful of
hesitaters, the pressure from Democrats nationwide, focused on those
members, will be overwhelming. If there are real holdouts, they'll fold
in short order. You don't need to wait on Nancy Pelosi or Chuck Schumer
or President Biden. You can get the ball rolling by calling up your
Democratic senator today.

#### The plan signals an unpopular international shift in democrat's priorities that undermines their path to victory. NATO security cooperation worries voters and is perceived as trading off with domestic issues that appeal more to swing voters

Bruce **Stokes 20**, 9-4-2020, \"US Electorate Shows Distrust of the
Realities of Foreign Policy,\" Chatham House -- International Affairs
Think Tank,
https://www.chathamhouse.org/2020/09/us-electorate-shows-distrust-realities-foreign-policy

Whoever occupies the White House after the election, it is evident the
emphasis will be on 'America First', and that only characteristics and
approaches will differ. If Donald Trump is re-elected, his electoral
base will support a continuation of isolationist, protectionist
policies. If Joe Biden becomes president, he will enjoy some limited
popular backing for international re-engagement, but his voters still
clearly want him to prioritize domestic issues. Implications for the
foreign policy of the next US administration are evident. America may
have a long history of isolationism, but that should not be confused
with ignorance of the growing interconnectedness of today's world.
However, **[Americans are struggling to find a new equilibrium for their
country's role in the world]{.underline}**. Around seven-in-ten hold the
view that the United States should take a leading or major role in
international affairs, and the same number acknowledge that
international events affect their daily life. But **[Americans remain
reticent about global engagement, and half of registered voters believe
other countries take unfair advantage of the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates. This clear contradiction is mirrored in what
can be expected from the election victor, with a Joe Biden
administration likely to speak for those who want America to lead, while
a second Donald Trump administration is expected to continue complaining
about US victimization by an ungrateful world. A majority (57%) of
Americans say foreign policy is 'very important' to them as they decide
who to vote for in the 2020 election. This may seem like a high
priority, but American polls often show many issues are 'very important'
to voters. What matters is relative importance and **[foreign policy
pales in comparison with the significance the public accords to the
economy (79%) or healthcare (68%).]{.underline}** Immigration (52%) and
climate change (42%) are of even less relative importance to voters.
Notably, despite the deep partisanship in American politics today,
**[there is no difference between Republican and Democrat voters on the
low priority they accord foreign policy]{.underline}**. And barely
one-third (35%) of the public give top priority to working with allies
and international institutions to confront global challenges such as
climate change, poverty and disease --- in fact only 31% say improving
relations with allies should be a top foreign policy priority over the
next five years. However, despite this apparent lack of support for
international relations, a rising majority of Americans believe
international trade is good for the economy --- running contrary to many
international assumptions that Americans are inherently protectionist.
But this increased interest may not amount to much in reality. Americans
also believe trade destroys jobs and lowers wages. Trump is clearly
wedded to a protectionist worldview and may continue to try dismantling
the World Trade Organization (WTO). Biden is unlikely to initiate any
new trade liberalizing negotiations given what would be, at best, a slim
Democratic majority in the Senate and anti-trade views held by many
unions and blue-collar voters among his constituency. Any political
capital he commits to trade is likely to focus on reforming the WTO, but
privately his advisers admit they are not optimistic. In addition, both
Biden and Trump face strong public support for ratcheting up pressure on
China, although their lines of attack may differ, with Trump likely to
double down on tariffs while Biden would work closely with Europe on
both trade and human rights issues. More broadly, almost three-quarters
(73%) of Americans now express an unfavourable view of China, up 18
points since the last presidential election. One-quarter of Americans
classify Beijing as an 'enemy' with almost half saying the US should get
tougher with China on economic issues, although attitudes do divide
along partisan lines, with Republicans generally more critical of
Beijing, but Democrats are tougher on human rights. On immigration,
Trump's policies are out of step with the public. Six-in-ten Americans
oppose expanding the border wall with Mexico, 74% support legal status
for immigrants illegally brought to the United States as children ---
including a majority of Republicans (54%) --- and as many Americans
favour increasing immigration as support decreasing it. But Trump has
already promised to double down on limiting immigration if he wins
because it is what his Republican electoral base wants and, as with
trade, this is one of his long-expressed personal beliefs. If he wins,
expect more mass roundups of undocumented people, completion of his
border wall and stricter limitations on legal immigration. In contrast,
Biden is likely to loosen constraints on immigration because he believes
immigration has been good for the economy and the Democratic party is
increasingly dependent on Hispanic and Asian voters, the two fastest
growing portions of the population. However, open borders are not a
Biden option. The US foreign-born population is at near-record levels
and, every time in American history the portion of foreign born has come
close to being 14% of the total population --- in the 1880s, the 1920s
and now --- there has been a populist backlash. Democrats cannot risk
that again. On climate change, there is strong evidence the American
public is increasingly worried, and likely to support rejoining the
Paris Agreement if Biden is elected and increases US commitments to cut
carbon emissions. But the public also appears unlikely to punish Trump
if, as promised, he leaves that accord, and he is almost certain to
continue denying climate science in the interest of the coal, oil, and
gas industries. The public's concern about global warming does not
necessarily translate into support for taking substantive action. There
is a huge partisan divide between the number of Democrats (68%) and
Republicans (11%) who say climate change is a very important issue in
the 2020 election. When pressed on what action they want on climate
change, and who they trust to do it, Americans are less likely than
Europeans to accept paying higher prices. A carbon tax stands no chance
of passing the Senate, thanks to moderate Democrats from fossil-fuel
states, and America's love affair with large, CO²-emitting vehicles
shows no signs of ebbing. The outcome of the 2020 US election will
almost certainly not be determined by foreign concerns, although an
international crisis --- a terrorist incident, a military confrontation
with China or North Korea --- could impact voting in an unforeseen way.
But given the mood of the American electorate, if Trump is re-elected,
there will be scant public pressure for a more activist, collaborative
US foreign policy, beyond support for a tough line on China, while a win
for Biden will give more room for some international initiatives. **[But
public opinion data is clear. Voters want the next US president to focus
first on domestic issues]{.underline}** --- overcoming the pandemic,
digging the country out of a deep economic hole, calming racial
tensions, and reversing inequality. The outcome of the election may end
America's recently antagonistic foreign policy and halt the
deterioration of its international role. But dramatic American
re-engagement appears unlikely as the public's priorities lie elsewhere.

#### Only a dem midterm win can assure successful China policy to counter Chinese leadership

A [[Biden]{.underline}]{.mark} White House is [[likely to oversee
a]{.mark} steadier and [more coherent China policy
than]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}
administration, whose erratic approach careened from President Donald
Trump's fawning praise of Chinese President Xi Jinping---including
reportedly condoning concentration camps in Xinjiang---to name-calling
and fighting a failed tariff war. [A consistent approach will bring more
stability to a delicate and difficult relationship]{.underline}. [But
[a]{.mark} more [stable approach does not mean a soft one]{.mark},
[since there is]{.mark} now a [bipartisan recognition]{.mark} in the
United States [that]{.mark} [China is a strategic
competitor]{.mark}]{.underline}. Indeed, while Beijing may appreciate
soon having a more predictable set of interlocutors, it should not
expect them to be more pliable. [Helping Biden is the fact that much of
U.S. foreign policy is the prerogative of the president and therefore
less constrained than domestic policy by the legislative
branch]{.underline}. **[But]{.underline}** if Republican Sen. Mitch
McConnell remains in control of the U.S. Senate, **[[one of the first
tests for]{.underline}]{.mark}** the
**[[Republicans]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the Senate [[will be whether
they will **cut off America's nose**]{.mark} [in order to spite the new
president's face]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[The]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[[**needs** a]{.mark} robust economic stimulus, **including [significant
investment in infrastructure]{.mark}**, in order to make it to the other
side of the pandemic [and jump-start the econom]{.mark}y]{.underline}.
[[Republicans who **want to be tougher on China** must recognize that a
strong U.S. economy is a **strategic imperative**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Some commentators have suggested that the Trump presidency, and its
undignified end, has emboldened Chinese government leaders and raised
their confidence in the superiority of their own system. On Election
Day, the editor of the Chinese government propaganda newspaper Global
Times, Hu Xijin, gleefully posted on Twitter about storefronts being
boarded up in U.S. cities, writing that unrest is usually a
"complication of elections in poor countries, but people are worried it
may appear in the US. The US is in degradation." It should be noted, of
course, that the Chinese Communist Party boards up its windows from the
inside, metaphorically speaking, to keep citizens from seeing how the
leaders of its authoritarian regime are selected. [We cannot
deny]{.underline} or dismiss [the damage done to the global reputation
of U.S. democracy by Trump's antics. But neither should we overstate
that damage. In the end, the United States]{.underline}---a giant,
multiethnic, multiconfessional, industrialized democracy---had an
election where the result was unknown ahead of time. It generated record
voter participation and was held with relatively few problems in the
midst of a global pandemic. It [delivered a defeat for the incumbent and
a new president]{.underline}. [Biden will most likely lead the United
States with a divided government]{.underline}. [[His
admin]{.mark}istration [will have to work with senators and
representatives]{.mark} from diverse constituencies and make compromises
in order to strike deals that equip the county [to
**confront**]{.mark}]{.underline} the challenges of the 21st century,
including **[its strategic rivalry with]{.underline}**. It will be messy
and challenging, and progress will not be linear. But this is not a new
story---it is a very old one. Chinese leaders pride themselves on taking
a long view. The United **[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}** States faces
plenty of foreign and domestic challenges today, including in its
democratic institutions. But in the long view, its democracy is not a
source of weakness; it is a source of strength.

#### US tech leadership solves nuclear war

**Kroenig** & Gopalaswamy **18**, \*Associate Professor of Government
and Foreign Service at Georgetown University and Deputy Director for
Strategy in the Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security at the

Recently, analysts have argued that emerging technologies with military
applications may undermine nuclear stability (see here, here, and here),
but the logic of these arguments is debatable and overlooks a more
straightforward reason [why new technology might cause **nuclear
conflict**: by upending the existing balance of power among
nuclear-armed states]{.underline}. This latter concern is more probable
and dangerous and demands an immediate policy response. For more than 70
years, the world has avoided major power conflict, and many attribute
this era of peace to nuclear weapons. In situations of mutually assured
destruction (MAD), neither side has an incentive to start a conflict
because doing so will only result in its own annihilation. The key to
this model of deterrence is the maintenance of secure second-strike
capabilities---the ability to absorb an enemy nuclear attack and respond
with a devastating counterattack. Recently analysts have begun to worry,
however, that [new strategic military technologies may make it possible
for a state to conduct]{.underline} a [successful first strike on an
enemy]{.underline}. For example, Chinese colleagues have complained to
me in Track II dialogues that the United States may decide to launch a
sophisticated cyberattack against Chinese nuclear command and control,
essentially turning off China's nuclear forces. Then, Washington will
follow up with a massive strike with conventional cruise and hypersonic
missiles to destroy China's nuclear weapons. Finally, if any Chinese
forces happen to survive, the United States can simply mop up China's
ragged retaliatory strike with advanced missile defenses. China will be
disarmed and US nuclear weapons will still be sitting on the shelf,
untouched. If the United States, or any other state acquires such a
first-strike capability, then the logic of MAD would be undermined.
Washington may be tempted to launch a nuclear first strike. Or China may
choose instead to use its nuclear weapons early in a conflict before
they can be wiped out---the so-called "use 'em or lose 'em" problem.
According to this logic, therefore, the appropriate policy response
would be to ban outright or control any new weapon systems that might
threaten second-strike capabilities. This way of thinking about new
technology and stability, however, is open to question. Would any US
president truly decide to launch a massive, bolt-out-of-the-blue nuclear
attack because he or she thought s/he could get away with it? And why
does it make sense for the country in the inferior position, in this
case China, to intentionally start a nuclear war that it will almost
certainly lose? More important, this conceptualization of how new
technology affects stability is too narrow, focused exclusively on how
new military technologies might be used against nuclear forces directly.
Rather, [we should think]{.underline} more [broadly about how new
technology might affect global politics, and]{.underline}, for this, [it
is helpful to turn to scholarly international relations
theory]{.underline}. The dominant theory of the causes of war in the
academy is [the "[bargaining]{.mark} model of war."]{.underline} This
theory [[identifies rapid shifts in the balance of power as a **primary
cause of conflict**]{.mark}. International politics]{.underline} often
[presents states with conflicts that they can settle through peaceful
bargaining, but when bargaining breaks down, war results. Shifts in the
balance of power are problematic because **they undermine effective
bargaining**]{.underline}. After all, why agree to a deal today if your
bargaining position will be stronger tomorrow? And, a [clear
understanding of the military balance of power can contribute to
peace]{.underline}. (Why start a war you are likely to lose?) [But
shifts in the balance of power muddy understandings of which states have
the advantage]{.underline}. You may see where this is going. [[New
tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nologies [threaten to [create]{.mark}
potentially **[destabilizing shifts in]{.mark} the [balance of
power]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For decades, [stability in]{.underline}
Europe and [Asia has been supported by US military power.]{.underline}
In recent years, however, [the balance of power in Asia has begun to
shift, as China has increased its military capabilities]{.underline}.
Already, [[Beijing has become]{.mark} **more [assertive]{.mark}** in the
region, [claiming]{.mark} contested [territory]{.mark}]{.underline} in
the South China Sea. And the results of Russia's military modernization
have been on full display in its ongoing intervention in Ukraine.
Moreover, [[China may]{.mark} have the [lead over the
**U**]{.mark}]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[in
emerging tech]{.mark}nologies [that could be decisive for]{.mark} the
future of military acquisitions and [warfare, including 3D
printing]{.mark}, hypersonic [missiles,]{.mark} quantum [computing,
5G]{.mark} wireless connectivity, [and]{.mark}]{.underline} artificial
intelligence ([[AI]{.underline}]{.mark}). And Russian President Vladimir
Putin is building new unmanned vehicles while ominously declaring,
"Whoever leads in AI will rule the world." [[If
China]{.underline}]{.mark} or Russia [[are able to incorporate new
tech]{.mark}nologies into their militaries [before the
**U**]{.mark}]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates, then
[this [could]{.mark} lead to the kind of rapid shift in the balance of
power that often [cause]{.mark}s [war. If Beijing believes emerging
tech]{.mark}nologies [provide]{.mark} it with a newfound, local
[military advantage over the **U**]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates, for example, [[it may]{.mark}
be]{.underline} more [willing]{.underline} than previously [to
**[initiate conflict over Taiwan]{.mark}**]{.underline}. And if Putin
thinks new tech has strengthened his hand, he may be more tempted to
launch a Ukraine-style invasion of a NATO member.
[[Either]{.underline}]{.mark} scenario [[could bring]{.mark} these
nuclear [powers into]{.mark} direct [conflict with the
**U**]{.mark}]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates, [and
once nuclear armed states are at war, [there is]{.mark} an [inherent
risk of nuclear conflict through limited]{.mark} nuclear [war]{.mark}
strategies, **nuclear [brinkmanship]{.mark}**[, or]{.mark} **simple
[accident]{.mark}** or **inadvertent escalation**. This framing of the
problem leads to a different set of policy implications. The concern
is]{.underline} not simply technologies that threaten to undermine
nuclear second-strike capabilities directly, but, rather, any
[technologies that can result in a meaningful shift in the broader
balance of power]{.underline}. And the solution is not to preserve
second-strike capabilities, but to preserve prevailing power balances
more broadly. When it comes to new technology, this means that [[the
**U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[[should seek to maintain]{.mark} an [innovation
edge]{.mark}]{.underline}. Washington should also work with other
states, including its nuclear-armed rivals, to develop a new set of arms
control and nonproliferation agreements and export controls to deny
these newer and potentially destabilizing technologies to potentially
hostile states. These are no easy tasks, but t[he [consequences of
Washington **losing**]{.mark} **the race for [tech]{.mark}**nological
**[superiority]{.mark}**]{.underline} to its autocratic challengers just

## !---Democracy 

### I/L -- Filibuster 

#### The filibuster hinders democratic progression and stunts governance

**Zajdowicz 5/25** \[Thad Zajdowicz, Co-editor of the Book Corner, "The
Filibuster---Good or Bad?", League of Women Voters, June 25 2022,
https://my.lwv.org/california/pasadena/article/book-corner-5\]//RA

The word *filibuster* does not appear in the Constitution. The word is
originally from the Dutch *vrijbueter* (freebooter), with contributions
from the Spanish and French. The genesis of the filibuster is arcane and
the history voluminous.

[Filibusters were uncommon in the nineteenth century]{.underline}. In
1917, the Senate created Rule 22, which allowed cloture to bring a bill
or other matter to a vote. Between 1917 and 1975, cloture required only
a supermajority (two-thirds) of senators who were present and voting.
"Present and voting" was defined as being in or near the Senate chamber.
This meant that cloture could be invoked by a small number of senators
(e.g., two out of three who were present and voting). In 1975, the
cloture requirement was changed to three-fifths of all senators, none of
whom needed to be in Washington to count. Cloture became very difficult
to invoke with that rule, making the simple threat of a filibuster
enough to stall legislation.

[Filibusters increased after 1951 as Southern senators worked to block
civil rights legislation**.**]{.underline} Strom Thurmond infamously
conducted the longest filibuster on record, twenty-four hours and
eighteen minutes, in opposition to the Civil Rights Act of 1957. **[This
was not what the Framers intended when they wrote the
Constitution.]{.underline}** James Madison and the other Framers viewed
the Senate as a body that would debate measures in meaningful ways,
rather than reading from the Bible or recipe books. When the membership
of the Senate was smaller and communications slower, the idea made
sense. But **[the rise of political parties in the early nineteenth
century and the splits over policy resulting from the Civil War and
Reconstruction]{.underline}**---not to mention our more recent political
polarization---**[have enabled a minority party to drive the federal
legislative agenda.]{.underline}** [The simple threat of a filibuster is
now enough to kill prospective legislation and nominations;]{.underline}
tweets and emails suffice to sink important agendas. The Senate today is
anti-majoritarian.

Is the filibuster good or bad? Mostly, **[it is a mistake that was
allowed to grow for partisan purposes over two centuries]{.underline}**.
Those who believe the filibuster resembles anything like Jimmy Stewart's
version in *Mr. Smith Goes to Washington* are mistaken.
[Republicans]{.underline}, currently the minority in the Senate, [have
threatened that elimination of the filibuster will be paid back in full
if and when they regain a Senate majority.]{.underline} The reality is
that there have been more than twenty years of legislative gridlock, in
large part due to the threat of filibusters.

[There is so much to be done to move our nation forward]{.underline}
that requires passing laws: voting rights, solving inequality,
healthcare, climate change, and dealing with over 400 years of racism.
[The answer is not abolishing the filibuster but deciding that a
minority that wants to preserve it must endure pain.]{.underline}
Senators should have to stand and deliver their objections, on their
feet, yielding the floor only because of fatigue or calls of nature.
Senate work may grind to a halt, but honest debate---not obstruction by
the minority---was why the Framers created the Senate. **[The filibuster
as it stands impairs governance.]{.underline}**

#### American democracy threatened by a republican midterms sweep

The [stakes for the 2022 midterm elections just got a lot
higher]{.underline}. [American democracy and majority rule, a
cornerstone principle of our democracy, are on the ballot]{.underline}.
The recent [decisions to overturn Roe]{.underline} v. Wade and to allow
[gun owners' to carry a weapon in public reveal a Supreme Court far out
of touch with the views of an overwhelming majority of
American]{.underline}s. The [attempted coup by]{.underline} former
President [Trump]{.underline} and his cronies, exposed by Republican
witnesses at the explosive hearings of the January 6 special committee,
**[represents the greatest threat to American democracy since before the
Civil War]{.underline}**. And the continued success of pro-Trump
election deniers in Republican primaries this year coupled with the
reticence of far too many Republicans to renounce Trump's brazen and
illegal efforts to overturn 2020 election demonstrate [that threat is
ongoing]{.underline}. "[Our democracy is on a knife's edge," warned
conservative judge]{.underline} J. Michael Luttig in testimony before
the January 6 committee. How can democracy in America, the
constitutional republic that has been a model for free people everywhere
for nearly 250 years be suddenly in trouble? First, **[the vitality of
any democracy depends on the ability of democratic institutions to keep
pace with changing times]{.underline}**. But in the last quarter
century, important [democratic institutions]{.underline} like the
Senate, the Electoral College and the Supreme Court [have not kept up
with changes in our culture and the electorate.]{.underline} That
failure has [resulted in a structural imbalance in national
politics]{.underline}. Second, [a vibrant democracy must be a nation of
laws, not of men]{.underline}. We've had unscrupulous politicians
throughout our history, but until now we've always been able to stop the
rise of "cunning, ambitious, unprincipled men" who, George Washington
warned in his farewell address, would "usurp for themselves the reins of
government." Trump, his cronies, and, to a lesser extent, Senate
Republican leader Mitch McConnell have shown themselves to be the kind
of men Washington warned us about. The root of the institutional
imbalance is in the structure of the United States Senate. Our founding
fathers were men of great foresight, but in drafting the constitution,
they could hardly have imagined the chasm that divides today's America
between the fast growing, populous, increasingly diverse states along
the two coasts and the more numerous, more homogenous, less densely
populated, slower growing states in between. Because the constitution
allots two senators to each state, regardless of population, the senate
has in recent decades taken on a decidedly small state bias. For
example, California, the nation's largest state, and Wyoming, the
nation's least populous state, both get two senators despite the fact
that California's population is eighty times larger than Wyoming's. In
fact, the population of California is bigger than the combined
populations of the smallest 21 states. That means that more than 39
million people in those 21 states have 42 votes in the Senate while the
same number of people in California have just two. Since California
votes Democratic by large margins, if those 44 senators were allotted on
a per capita basis, they would overwhelmingly tilt Democratic by a
margin of about three to one, or 33 to 11. But because each state gets
two senators, and a majority of those 21 states vote Republican, the
actual tally is 25 Republicans and 19 Democrats. That's a swing of 28
seats. If you believe in one person one vote, the small state bias
clearly puts Democrats at a significant disadvantage. Just to break even
in the Senate, Democrats need to win more of the national vote for
Senate than the Republicans. With the even split in the current Senate,
the 50 Democratic senators represent 56.5% of the voters, while the 50
Republican senators represent just 43.5% of the voters. In 2018, the
Democrats won nearly 18 million more votes for Senate than the
Republicans, but the Republicans still gained two seats. Because so many
Republican senators come from very small states, the last time they
represented a majority of voters nationally was in 1996. But in seven of
12 Congresses since then, Republicans have held a majority of Senate
seats. Political data analyst David Shor projects that to have an even
chance of holding on to the Senate this year, Democrats need to win the
national vote for Senate by four points. If they win 51% of the national
vote for Senate this year, they'll likely lose a seat---and control of
the Senate. And Shor's model projects that in 2024 if the Democrats win
that same 51% majority, they could lose seven seats. The small state
bias in the Senate carries over to the Electoral College since each
state gets an Electoral College vote for each of its senators. So small
states get proportionately more electors. As a result, political analyst
Nate Silver estimates that a Democratic candidate must win the popular
vote by at least three percentage points to have an even chance of
winning in the electoral college. That reality has never been more
evident than in recent presidential elections. In the 25 presidential
elections in the 20th century, not once did the candidate who lost the
popular vote win the presidency in the Electoral College. But in the six
elections in this century, that has already happened twice. The Supreme
Court by design inevitably lags behind the public will. Because justices
have lifetime appointments, at any one time, the majority of the
justices will have been appointed by a past president and, thus unlikely
to reflect current majority opinion. The recent Roe and gun decisions
are prime examples. [The three justices who cast the deciding votes in
both cases were appointed by former President Trump who lost the popular
vote]{.underline} (in 2016) [by nearly three million votes and were
confirmed by senators who represented less than 45% of the
electorate]{.underline}. Trump, elected by a minority of voters, had
three court appointments because McConnell manipulated Senate procedures
to block confirmation of a justice appointed by President Obama, who
twice won a majority of the popular vote. In the best of all worlds, the
two parties would get together to reform and modernize our institutions
to eliminate their biases. But with today's polarized politics, that's
not going to happen. Instead, Republican leaders, as evidenced by
McConnell's manipulation of the Supreme Court confirmation process and
Trump's attempted coup, have exploited these institutional imbalances in
order to cling to vital levers of power even though their coalition now
represents a minority of voters. Think about this: the Democrats have
won the popular vote in seven of the last eight presidential elections,
the longest winning streak for any party in American history, yet they
have won the presidency only five times.\[1\] The chances of changing
the small state bias are slim to non-existent. Representatives from
small states cannot be expected to amend the political deal that gave
them such outsized power in the first place, particularly if, as most
pundits predict, the Republicans, who benefit from it, win control of
the House and Senate this year. RELATED CONTENT Congresswoman Diane

explicitly stated in the Constitution (e.g., same-sex marriage). With
the exception of Thomas, all of the conservative justices in the

only alternative is for Democrats to appeal beyond party lines to voters
concerned about democracy and majority rule, even small state
conservatives, and win House and Senate seats not only in traditional
Democratic areas but also in districts and states that ordinarily vote
Republican. Admittedly, with voters dissatisfied with President Biden
over high inflation and rising crime, that's not likely to happen. Even
in years that the political environment favors Democrats they have to
over perform just to break even. But it's not impossible as the
Democratic sweep in the post-Watergate election of 1974 has shown. That
was the last time the fate of our democratic system was on the line. To
win in normally hostile territory, Democrats will need to find new
allies among all voters who want to preserve our
democracy---independents, suburban voters, moderate and anti-Trump
Republicans, and hardworking ordinary Americans---voters who would
normally vote Republican but are appalled at the actions of Trump, his
extremist MAGA supporters, and the McConnell Supreme Court. That will
require the Democrats to ditch their normal base-oriented midterm
election strategy. They need to make **[this fall's election about
preserving democracy and majority rule]{.underline}**. Democrats need to
open their tent to all voters who share that grand purpose---regardless
of party or ideology. Pressing partisan Democratic agendas, and pet
programs will have to wait until our democratic system is secure.
Progressives will have to understand that Democrats will not defeat
Republican extremism by offering extreme ideas of their own. The late
Democratic political commentator Mark Shields once said that politics is
about looking for converts, not punishing heretics. 2022 is not a year
for ideological purity tests and punishing heretics. For the sake of our
country, our democracy and the principle of majority rule, this year
more than ever Democrats need to find more converts.

#### Midterm's crucial to prevent democratic backsliding

from Democrats that **[US democracy will be at stake in the November

star Ron DeSantis the man to displace Trump in 2024? Read more In South
Carolina, a vote to impeach Trump for inciting the January 6
insurrection proved one Republican's undoing while another survived the
former president's wrath to win the nomination. n In south Texas, where
Hispanic voters have shifted sharply toward the Republican party, a
Republican flipped a House seat long held by a Democrat. The [loss was a
stark warning that Democrats' standing with a crucial voting bloc is
slipping]{.underline}. Nevada, a swing state that has trended Democratic
in past election cycles, will play host to a number of consequential
races this fall, for House, Senate, governor and secretary of state, as
Democrats seek to defend narrow majorities in Congress. **[In the 50-50
Senate, every race will matter]{.underline}**. But the party is saddled
with a deeply unpopular president in a political system primed for
revolt against the party in power. Inflation and the war in Ukraine have
caused the cost of food and gas to shoot up while angst over gun
violence and a shortage of baby formula deepens voter frustration.
Republicans view the Nevada Senate race as one of their best chances of
flipping a Democratic seat. They also sense an opportunity to make
inroads in a state dominated by Democrats who were guided to power by
the late Senate majority leader, Harry Reid. The senator up for
re-election, Catherine Cortez Masto, was his chosen successor. Adam
Laxalt, a former state attorney general endorsed by Trump, easily won
the Republican primary to take on Cortez Masto in one of the most
fiercely contested races of the cycle. Jim [Marchant]{.underline}, a
former lawmaker who has dabbled in [the QAnon conspiracy theory and
openly embraced the idea of overturning elections, will be the
Republican nominee to become secretary of state, and]{.underline}
therefore **[the top election official in a swing state]{.underline}**
that could be crucial to determining the presidential contest in 2024.
Advertisement The elevation of election-denying Republicans across the
US comes even as a bipartisan House panel investigating the Capitol
attack unspools damning testimony from Trump's inner circle,
discrediting the former president's claims. In South Carolina,
Republicans ousted the five-term incumbent, Tom Rice, who crossed Trump
and loyalists by voting to impeach the former president. Rice was
defeated by Russell Fry, a Republican state lawmaker backed by Trump.
The result was a welcome one for Trump after setbacks last month in
races where Trump sought retribution against Republicans who rebuffed
his attempts to overturn the 2020 election. But as in Georgia, there
were limits to his influence. Another Republican House incumbent, Nancy
Mace, fended off a Trump-backed challenger. Unlike in Rice's staunchly
conservative district, Mace -- who did not vote to impeach but did
criticise Trump -- held on by attracting support from suburban voters
who abandoned the party during the Trump years. On social media, Trump
spun the evening as a resounding success. Mace's challenger, Katie
Arrington, he said, was a "very long-shot" who "did FAR better than
anticipated". "The 'Impeacher' was ousted without even a runoff. a GREAT
night!," Trump wrote on his social media site, Truth Social, about Rice.
In Maine, Jared Golden, one of the few Democrats to represent a House
district Trump carried, will attempt to defy political gravity in a
rematch against the seat's former representative, Bruce Poliquin. Golden
narrowly beat Poliquin in the anti-Trump wave of 2018. With political
winds reversed, Poliquin hopes to regain the seat. The state's combative
former governor, Paul LePage, is also attempting a comeback. Facing no
opposition, he clinched the Republican nomination to run against the
incumbent, Janet Mills. Perhaps most worrying for Democrats was the loss
in south Texas. A Republican state representative, Mayra Flores, cruised
to victory, avoiding a runoff against her main Democratic opponent, Dan
Sanchez, in a special election to fill a seat vacated by a Democratic
congressman, Filemón Vela. Flores will have to run again in November.
Because of redistricting, she is set to square off against the
Democratic congressman Vicente Gonzalez in a district considerably more
left-leaning than the one she will temporarily represent. Nevertheless,
some prognosticators moved their ratings for the district in
Republicans' favor, citing gains among Hispanic voters in the Rio Grande
Valley. In a memo from the National Republican Congressional Committee
obtained by CNN, the party touted Flores' victory as the culmination of
efforts to recruit and run more diverse candidates and said it offered a
"blueprint for success in South Texas". It concluded: "This is the first
of many Democrat-held seats that will flip Republican in 2022."

#### Democratic win revives democracy and prevents backsliding 

Brent **Budowsky 22,** 5-25-2022, Budowsky is an American political

an epic midterm election,\" Hill,
https://thehill.com/opinion/3500318-budowsky-how-dems-can-win-an-epic-midterm-election/

On Nov. 8, 2022, the American people will make a decision that will
change the course of history, send shock waves across the globe, and be
written about by historians a century from now. It may literally be
**[the most important midterm election in a century]{.underline}**.
Here's why: Today [**democracy is fighting** back fiercely against
attacks by foreign dictators abroad and Republican partisans at home who
still try to reverse the 2020 election, elect state Republicans who
would corrupt the 2024 election, and practice aggressive voter
suppression reminiscent of the dark days of segregatio]{.underline}n.
Many of our citizens are deeply concerned about the dangers to their
economic lives. They face the risks of inflation and recession. They
widely distrust politicians in BOTH parties. [Americans are enormously
frustrated by the inability of official Washington to transcend
gridlock]{.underline}, act to protect them, and lift their lives and
those of their family, community and country. They are appalled by a
packed Supreme Court essentially employing party-line votes to undermine
their rights, while extremist Republicans states try to force-feed
far-right views while attacking the right to vote. Democrats need to
powerfully address their concerns with a Contract for America that
includes specific pledges to improve their economic lives, health care,
environment, safety from crime and right to vote. To defend against
threats to our democracy, they should mobilize the largest voter
registration in history, propel massive small donor fundraising and
inspire a rousing defense for democracy with large donations from the
wealthiest believers in the cause. ADVERTISING It is often
[suggested]{.underline}, in my view **[incorrectly, that because
President Biden's favorable numbers are low, Democrats are doomed to
defeat in the midterms.]{.underline}** This results from [**a
misunderstanding of the political situation to**day]{.underline}. If we
review the RealClearPolitics 10 most [recent 2022 generic congressional
vote polls]{.underline} as of yesterday morning**[, Democrats were
leading in five, Republicans in four, and the other was
tied]{.underline}**. How can this be? If we review the RealClearPolitics
favorable ratings of political leaders, as of yesterday morning, Biden's
rating was 43.6 percent, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.)
was much lower, at 28 percent, and Senate Minority Leader Mitch
McConnell (R-Ky.) was even lower, at 26.3 percent! Voters are not
dissatisfied with Biden, they are [dissatisfied with ALL leaders of BOTH
parties in Washington, with Biden's approval significantly higher than
McCarthy's or McConnell's]{.underline}! Given this season of discontent
in our democracy, with more than a 90 percent probability, on the
morning of Nov. 9, the nation and world will wake up to one of two
potential midterm outcomes. The first possibility is that **[Republicans
gain control of the House, the Senate or both]{.underline}**. This
**[result would be armageddon]{.underline}** for the Biden presidency.
The [legislative branch would be unable to pass any major proposal from
President Biden or Democrats in Congress. Congressional Republicans
would be unable to enact any legislation without President Biden's
signature. In]{.underline} this scenario, a Republican House or Senate
would degenerate into little more than permanent partisan Republican
investigations of Democrats and partisan Republican gridlock in
Washington --- [provoking widespread anger and rage from a majority of
Americans]{.underline}, while Republicans compete with each other to be
more extreme, in the party of Trump, not Lincoln. The second
possibility, which is less likely than I wish but more likely than most
pundits believe, is that Democrats retain control of the Senate and
House, and gain one or two Senate seats. In this scenario, [Biden and
Democrats would be able to enact a substantial program of economic,
health care, crime, climate change and voting rights legislation, which
a majority of Americans would applaud]{.underline}. What good is
intelligence in Ukraine? The Supreme Court fires broadside against the
Constitution Let's be clear, blunt and honest. Biden and Democrats do
not control a 50-50 Senate in which one or two Democratic senators alone
can overrule the Democratic president, 48 Democratic senators, and all
Democratic House members before they host fundraisers with grateful
Republican donors and special interests. **[With only one or two more
Democratic senators, Democrats and democracy would
flourish]{.underline}**! Budowsky was an aide to former Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen (D-Texas) and former Rep. Bill Alexander (D-Ark.), who was chief

As we get closer and closer to November\'s midterm elections, doomsday
predictions about a bloodbath for Democrats have come to dominate the
news. It seems like you can\'t turn on your TV or scroll through Twitter
for five minutes without being informed by some pundit or other---on
both sides of the political spectrum---about the dire situation the
Democrats face in races across the country. These naysayers are missing
the robust record that the [Democrats]{.underline} have to run on---one
that includes the not insignificant [line item of being the only side
standing up for Democracy itself]{.underline}.
**[Republicans]{.underline}** have shown their [laissez faire attitude
toward democracy]{.underline} in numerous ways, starting with **[passing
bills across the country restricting the right to vote.]{.underline}**
Then there\'s their **[penchant for denying the results of the 2020
election]{.underline}**, or **[opposing the bipartisan commission to
investigate the storming of the Capitol on January 6]{.underline}**, an
effort designed to undermine the electoral process altogether. Most
recently, leaked tapes revealed how Republican House Minority Leader
Kevin McCarthy really felt about Trump\'s role in inciting the January 6
attack, going so far as to say that Trump should resign immediately. In
another recently released tape, McCarthy accused some GOP lawmakers of
putting people in jeopardy. McCarthy was telling the truth: GOP
lawmakers put their colleagues in jeopardy and Trump should\'ve
resigned. But instead of admitting this, McCarthy attacked the press,
accusing them of spreading lies. Of course, he had to deny his
condemnation of Trump; he has done nothing but defend him since January
6, fighting the creation of an inquiry into that ugly day. Meanwhile,
it\'s been the Democrats (and two exiled Republicans) who have worked
overtime to expose Republicans\' corruption and sedition. Kevin McCarthy
and Donald Trump President Donald Trump reportedly said House Minority
Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-California) has an \"inferiority complex.\"
Above, Trump speaks as he is joined by McCarthy at the White House on
January 4, 2019 in Washington, D.C. But while the work of the January 6
Committee is crucial to stabilizing our democracy, it\'s only the first
in a long list of accomplishments that Democrats can tout to their
constituents. President Biden\'s infrastructure bill is already
delivering: The bill has created jobs and is already fixing roads,
bridges and railways. It\'s already bringing clean drinking water to
some of the poorest communities and building access to high-speed
internet across the country. Democrats should be speaking nationally
about these accomplishments while showing the specific locations that
are being improved in their states or congressional districts. This is
nothing short of a home run for candidates running on the blue ticket.
Another huge victory for Democrats to tout is the American Rescue Plan,
which helped put money directly in the pockets of the American people,
helped protect them from COVID-19 and gave money directly to working
families. Democrats should remind voters of this---and of the fact that
most Republicans voted against the plan. Democrats also swiftly pushed
through Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson\'s nomination, a historic victory
that made Judge Jackson the first Black woman on the Supreme Court,
another thing most Republicans opposed. Reminding voters of this
accomplishment, and that it happened under the most diverse
administration in American history, should remind folks that diversity
in leadership matters. Then there\'s the fact that Biden helped unite
the western world against Russia together with the leadership shown by
Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Democrats. Finally, we must remind Americans
what Republicans stand for: a whole lot of nothing. Nothing good, at
least. The Republicans are the party of January 6, of banning Critical
Race Theory (CRT) in schools where it\'s not taught, and of anti-gay
legislation that addresses \"problems\" that don\'t exist. So as
[Democrats]{.underline} move into the midterm elections, they must
remember one key thing: This is their election to lose. They **[have the
record to run on and theirs is the only party defending
democracy]{.underline}**. If the Democratic Party can focus on a clear,
cohesive and united message that just tells the American people the
truth, they will prove to be unbeatable.

However, [reducing the United States' emphasis on a values-driven
foreign policy is wrong, and contrary to the strategic interests of the
United States]{.underline}. **[[Democracy
promotion]{.underline}]{.mark}** [in particular [serves]{.mark} a **[key
role in safeguarding U.S. interests]{.mark}**]{.underline} []{.mark}[and
promoting global, long-term growth in ways fundamentally compatible with
U.S. strategic interests.]{.underline} After all, **[[democracies
protect private property]{.underline}]{.mark}** [in important ways[,
**invest in public goods**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [are more politically
stable, make for **[more dependable allies]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [and
empirically **[do not go to war with one another]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Ultimately, a world full of democratic governments is safer, more
prosperous, and more stable --- all states of being that the United
States has an interest in promoting.

[[Democracy guarantees]{.mark} that the public has a stake in its own
institutions and government, which leads to **[investor confidence
and]{.mark} growth**. Since elected politicians are accountable to
property owners and are held in check by an independent judiciary,
democracies tend to have better mechanisms for **protecting private
property**]{.underline} [than their autocratic counterparts. This makes
democracies a **particularly attractive type of country for investors**
--- both public and private --- because checks and balances make it
difficult for the state to nationalize industries]{.underline}. Further,
[private property rights protected by the legal system **[encourage
entrepreneurship and small business development]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[both of which are **key to a growing and modernizing
economy**]{.underline}. As a result, [democracies tend to be wealthier
and more economically stable than their autocratic
counterparts.]{.underline} This is fundamentally in the interest of the
United States in that both private and public investors have an interest
in seeing returns on their investments, [thereby potentially making
**countries less willing to go to war if that would require severing
economic ties**]{.underline}. Democratic institutions ensure that
citizens with both economic and political power are heard.

[Democracies also **[invest in public goods]{.mark} at much higher rates
than autocratic governments**]{.underline}. [Because politicians must
cater to the median voter, they **approve policies that invest in public
education and healthcare**]{.underline}, [both of which promote
long-term growth and development]{.underline}. Public education invests
in a country's human capital, setting the stage for long-term
innovation, adaptability, and advancement. [Public healthcare,
meanwhile, has been shown to **[increase overall societal
productivity]{.mark}** and well-being as people take fewer sick days,
citizens are able to afford their healthcare without going bankrupt, and
ultimately, [the overall **costs of healthcare are driven down**]{.mark}
as citizens become healthier]{.underline}. Productive, innovative
societies are also better for the United States --- [innovation around
the world improves global quality of life, results in more educational
and vocational opportunities for Americans]{.underline} (both because
other universities and jobs become more attractive to Americans who want
to go abroad and because potential immigrants are more likely to want to
stay in their own country, opening up opportunities for U.S. citizens at
home), [and may reduce friction between countries over resources and
labor]{.underline}.

[Democracies are also generally more politically stable because regular
election cycles ensure an established process for the habitual and
peaceful removal of leaders from power.]{.underline} [Elections ensure
the non-violent transition of power and reduce the need for mass
protest, rioting, and revolution --- which **[makes countries more
politically stable]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Further, when citizens are
granted rights and protections from government abuse, enforced by an
independent judiciary, they have fewer grievances against the government
and are thus less able to mobilize large numbers of people to violently
overthrow the regime. [Revolution, while not always violent, often leads
to political instability, challenges to growth, **[increased incentives
for diversionary war and conflict]{.mark}**, and oftentimes civil
war]{.underline}. The externalities of civil war and international
conflict then put pressure on the United States to intervene, protect
human rights, and otherwise expend resources on other countries' issues.
[Further, civil wars are highly destructive to institutions, human
capital, and resources, and can have significant security spillover
effects, increasing global risk of political [instability and **violent
extremism**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[This political stability, in addition to institutional checks and
balances, makes **democracies better international partners and allies
in the long-term**]{.underline}. Treaties ratified by multiple branches
of government are more durable than executive agreements signed by a
single leader who may be replaced within a short period of time. [While
democracies may be more reluctant to commit to alliances and formal
security pacts, once a party to them, they are more dependable than
other states with concentrated power at the executive
level]{.underline}. **[These [kind of durable commitments are of
interest to the United States as it seeks to preserve the liberal world
order]{.mark}]{.underline}**; [it is far more effective to ally with
partners whose institutions make withdrawal from the alliance
costly]{.underline}.

Finally, [it has been empirically observed that **[democracies do not go
to war with one another]{.mark}**]{.underline}. While there is a robust
debate around the exact nature of the so-called "democratic peace," it
[appears that there are qualities particular to democracies that make
war between them particularly unlikely: a **dovish public constrains
leaders' ability to wage war**]{.underline}, [competitive elections and
a free press make it **easier to credibly communicate resolve to
potential adversaries**]{.underline}, [consolidated democracies tend to
be **more wealthy and economically interdependent**]{.underline},
[like-minded people are more hesitant to wage war against one another,
and so on]{.underline}. Regardless of the precise mechanisms, however, a
[world of democracies is inherently safer, more prosperous, and less
likely to initiate a war against the United States --- a key factor in
protecting American security and interests]{.underline}.

### IL -- Dems k2 solve

#### Dem win in the midterms is key to implimenting effective climate policy 

Ben **Geman 21**, 6-26-2021, \"The clock is ticking on Biden\'s climate
agenda,\" Axios,
https://www.axios.com/2021/06/26/biden-climate-change-ticking-clock

President Biden is [under intense pressure to deliver on his historic
climate plans, with real danger that he'll miss his window on major
goals that allies had hoped were in their]{.underline} grasp. Why it
matters: Only six months into his presidency, Biden has a [limited
amount of time to tackle what he calls \"the No. 1 issue facing
humanity]{.underline}.\" Key parts of his platform are tethered to the
infrastructure push underway right now. Biden and liberal Democrats want
huge clean energy investments and tax incentives. They hope a
Democrats-only package would provide vastly more than energy measures in
the infrastructure outline Biden unveiled with a bipartisan Senate group
on Thursday. Threat level: **[Republicans have a good chance of
regaining one --- and perhaps both --- chambers of Congress in the 2022
midterms, effectively slamming Biden\'s window shut]{.underline}**. And
already [Democrats are having trouble locking down enough votes in their
own ranks for anything r]{.underline}esembling Biden\'s proposals around
electric cars, renewables, efficient buildings and more. The intrigue:
The time pressure is even more intense than the electoral calendar
suggests. November brings the most important United Nations climate
summit since the 2015 talks that birthed the Paris agreement. Walking
into that summit with an enacted package would help show that the White
House pledge to slash U.S. emissions by 50% by 2030 is realistic. But if
the U.S. effort is foundering, winning higher ambition and tangible new
steps from other nations could be a harder diplomatic lift. The big
picture: The U.S. is the world\'s second-largest greenhouse gas polluter
behind runaway leader China. Biden\'s campaign platform pledged a
sweeping emissions-cutting agenda that would go far beyond that of
former President Obama. The goals include a carbon-free power sector by
2035; strong new regulations to limit tailpipe emissions; new
restrictions on fossil fuel development; and massive new resources for
clean energy R&D and deployment. Big new investments and greatly
expanded clean energy incentives would require approval from Congress.
Another part of Biden\'s plan --- a [\"clean energy standard\" that
forces utilities to vastly ramp up carbon-free power --- also requires
legislation]{.underline}. Yes, but: The White House also hopes to
accomplish a lot with executive actions by redirecting agencies,
including the EPA and the Interior and Energy Departments, to be more
climate-focused. Just one of many examples: Biden is pushing the EPA and
the Transportation Department to rewrite vehicle efficiency rules to be
much tougher. There\'s also a multi-agency push to accelerate the
development of large offshore wind projects. And U.S. development
finance agencies --- including the U.S. International Development
Finance Corp. --- are putting a higher priority on clean energy.
Executive actions face their own hurdles, however, including litigation
that greets every major rulemaking. This month, a federal judge issued
an injunction against Biden\'s freeze on new oil lease sales --- a move
that foreshadows legal battles that will confront all his regulatory
efforts. The bottom line: \"Every passing day tests \[Biden\'s\] ability
to achieve an ambitious climate agenda in his first term, especially if
the infrastructure bill doesn't include the transformative investments
and tax credits for clean energy,\" Margaret Jackson of the Atlantic
Council\'s Global Energy Center tells Axios via email.

[Biden "needs the investments, and a lot rides on, does he get the
things he's proposed in the American Jobs Plan?" Podesta
said]{.underline}. "You can get some things going, but boy, I think
they're pretty dependent on some of the things \[Congress\] puts forth."
And progressives are also worried what not delivering on a bold climate
and infrastructure package could mean for the 2022 midterms, which
largely hinge on turning out a fired-up Democratic base. More liberal
lawmakers are coalescing around a new slogan: "No climate, no deal."
"We're not going to be able to get votes for a bill that does not
seriously address the climate crisis," Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA), the
chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said. The tepid economic
recovery under Obama pushed Democrats to go big on recent stimulus. Many
also learned a darker lesson about opportunities to pass climate
legislation: The stakes of inaction are incredibly high. Why the 2009
climate bill failed Fresh off resounding victories in the White House
and Congress in the 2008 election, Democrats had an ambitious list of
policy proposals. [Combatting climate change was a big priority, but it
fell behind passing economic stimulus, expanding health care, and a
financial reform bill after the recent economic crash. For about a
six-month window from summer 2009 to January 2010, Democrats had the 60
votes needed for a filibuster-proof majority. But that changed when
Republican Scott Brown won the special Senate election in Massachusetts
to fill the seat of the late Democratic Sen. Ted Kennedy. "We thought we
had more time with that supermajority than we ended up
having,]{.underline}" Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), a member of Senate
Democratic leadership, told me in an interview last summer. "Sen. Byrd
died and Sen. Kennedy died, and we only had a matter of months and got
the \[Affordable Care Act\] done, an economic stimulus package, and
Dodd-Frank done." Work on the Waxman-Markey climate bill began in the US
House, where it would continue for months of drafting and committee
input. The officially titled "American Clean Energy and Security Act"
was introduced in May 2009, weighing in at 1,400 pages. RELATED The once
and future Democratic consensus on climate change Democrats' plan would
have capped the nation's greenhouse gas emissions at a lower level,
giving fossil fuel companies the ability to buy emissions offsets to hit
their targets, or pay up if they went over. They settled on the
cap-and-trade model in part because it was something that past
Republican presidents had embraced. President George H.W. Bush proposed
a cap-and-trade system as part of the 1990 Clean Air Act to help reduce
sulfur emissions --- and many Republican senators voted for it. Indeed,
the Waxman-Markey cap-and-trade bill was controversial among climate
activists and experts who thought it was too friendly to big business
and called for a carbon tax instead. The bill also contained funding for
many of the things Biden is trying to do today, including incentives to
support more electric vehicles and clean energy. [The bill squeaked
through the House on a vote of 219-212 in June 2009, after months of
work and whipping votes by Pelosi's team. It never even made it to the
floor of the Senate, because then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid had
lost his supermajority with the Massachusetts election, and Democrats
were suddenly staring down a set of tough midterms in the House and
Senate. "The votes weren't there," said Jim Manley, a former
spokesperson for Reid. "I found that some of the worst vote counters
around were in the environmental community at this time. I don't blame
them for trying." Democrats' big climate bill died in the Senate in
2010. T]{.underline}hat history is a warning for Democrats today, who
have no margin for error in their current 50-50 Senate, where Vice
President Kamala Harris gives them one vote to break ties. Looking back,
a number of things set Waxman-Markey's demise in motion, current and
former lawmakers and staff told me. Democrats' big climate bill was too
in the weeds, was introduced when the country was still in a painful
economic recession, and wasn't the top priority. And even though
Democrats' climate bill was modeled on a Republican idea, Republicans
pounced on it as a job killer, taking a do-nothing stance on climate in
the process. "It [was a very tenuous economic time in a deeper, more
profound way than currently," said John Lawrence, who was chief of staff
to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi at the time. "It was difficult to figure
out where to put a big new controversial bill that looked to some people
like it would compound problems impacting the economy rather than
alleviating it." Then-Rep. Ed Markey speaks in 2009 as, left to right,
Reps. Henry Waxman, Steny Hoyer, James Clyburn, and House Speaker Nancy
Pelosi listen during a news conference after a vote on the Clean Energy
and Security Act on Capitol Hill. Alex Wong/Getty Images Sen. Tammy
Baldwin (D-WI), who was serving on the House Energy and Commerce
Committee at the time, said that cap and trade was too complicated for
voters to understand. Democrats need to improve their messaging, tying a
climate and clean energy agenda to a clear message about jobs, she said.
"Lessons learned \[are\] that we have to be able to show how we're
protecting working people, how we're creating new job opportunities, and
how we're protecting the planet]{.underline}," said Baldwin. "We have to
be very proactive, not just policy nerds." Ultimately, Waxman-Markey's
failure in 2010 meant that what Obama feared came to pass. The vast
majority of Obama's climate change agenda happened through the executive
branch, with regulations on vehicles and electrical appliances, and the
creation of the Clean Power Plan. Obama officials assumed that 2016
Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton would build on that, but Obama's
successor was instead President Donald Trump. It hasn't all been bad. As
the Atlantic's Robinson Meyer recently wrote, the US was still able to
hit --- even slightly exceed --- the carbon emissions targets
Waxman-Markey laid out (though, as Meyer points out, it's impossible to
know how much more emissions could have been avoided if the bill had
passed[). Even then, it still hasn't been enough to stop the devastating
impacts of climate change around the world and in the US. All of this
has convinced climate-minded Democrats that action from Congress is
needed to push the US into a clean energy transition. While Podesta told
E&E News in 2016 that Waxman-Markey's failure had shown him that strong
executive branch action was the way to go on climate, five years later,
he believes that action from Congress is essential,]{.underline} he told
me. Biden "needs a big jolt of federal investment to grease the gears,"
Podesta said.

#### Solves warming.

**Tucker and Steinbaum 18** \[Tucker and Steinbaum are fellows at the
Roosevelt Institute." 2020 Matters for the Left. Here\'s Why 2022
Matters Much More"
https://time.com/5475791/2020-bernie-sanders-2022-progressives-left-corbyn/\]//LP

For progressives across America, 2020 can't come fast enough. Fresh on
the heels of the biggest blue sweep of congressional seats since
Watergate, dozens of Democrats are readying potential presidential runs.
Mere days after trouncing his Republican opponent in a Senate, Ohio's
Sherrod Brown announced he was "thinking" about a run. Ditto for Beto
O'Rourke, who narrowly lost to Texas' arch-conservative Ted Cruz. Both
Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have given major foreign policy
speeches this fall --- a common prelude to a presidential campaign. Any
of these candidates would likely govern to the left of any recent
Democratic presidents.

But American progressives may be thinking too small. While the next U.S.
presidential election is a crucial stepping stone, [an even bigger year
rests on the horizon: 2022. By that time, the major European countries
will have had their national elections, and there is a non-trivial
chance that progressives could make a clean sweep. The first round of
voting in France will take place in April 2022, while the UK's must
happen no later than May 2022.]{.underline} German polls will take place
no later than October 2021. In the U.K., the Tories' unpopular Brexit
and "universal credit" policies have boosted Jeremy Corbyn's Labour
[Party. In France, the economically marginalized are protesting Emanuel
Macron's austerity measures, giving an opening to Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a
socialist who would have come in first in the 2017 elections had his
votes not been split with other likeminded candidates. A]{.underline}nd
in Germany, the Green Party made significant gains in local elections
last month, while the youth wing of the Social Democrats is pushing
their party elders to the left or to the side. And outside of Europe,
the Brazilian elections are also scheduled for 2022, while progressive
governments are already in place now in Canada, Mexico, and New Zealand.

If the stars align, [2022 could be a once-in-a-century opportunity for
progressives to push through major changes to an international system
that has often held back progress at the domestic level]{.underline}.
After all, the fundamental problems the left wants to solve don't
respect borders. [Take the latest projections from the United Nations on
climate change. The agency estimates mass food shortages and wild fires
as soon as 2040, unless greenhouse gas pollution is cut in half in the
next decade. Such a rapid energy transition has no precedent in human
history, and is unthinkable without internationally coordinated
government interventions and spending far beyond that envisioned in the
Paris climate accords.]{.underline}

### IL -- Narrow Window

#### There's a narrow window to avoid climate catastrophe

**Orszag** 3-2-20**21**, chief executive officer of financial advisory
at Lazard. He was director of the Office of Management and Budget from
2009 to 2010, and director of the Congressional Budget Office from 2007

https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-03-02/biden-s-build-back-better-plan-must-put-climate-over-deficit)//BB

Yet [[sacrificing climate investments]{.mark} at the altar of budget
neutrality [would be a grave mistake]{.mark}]{.underline}. **[[We have
reached a crucial moment]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the climate debate.
Lazard's [studies]{.underline} of the levelized cost of energy and
storage have [documented stunning declines in the expense of generating
and storing renewable energy]{.underline}. What's more, [a generation of
[electricity-producing capacity needs to be
replaced]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} and [hydrogen technology may be
on the verge of a revolution]{.underline}. [[The **window for making
bold investments**]{.mark} to cut the risk of catastrophic climate
change **[remains open]{.mark}**]{.underline}[,
**[but]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[it [won't stay
open]{.mark}]{.underline}** forever. There's a reason Bill Gates took
this moment to write a book about the clean-energy transition: He knows
[**[it's essential to act now to "avoid a climate
disaster]{.underline}**."]{.mark} So there are two fundamental risks in
requiring deficit neutrality for new climate investments: It would shift
the debate to offsets, rather than the need for ambitious new
investment. And the investments would be scaled back to match the
available offsets, making the legislation insufficiently ambitious. 3
Forced to choose between going big on climate mitigation or limiting
deficit expansion, I would take the first option without hesitation.
Fiscal problems can be fixed in the future if need be, but [the
opportunity to fix climate change won't last]{.underline}. If our main
concern is our legacy for future generations, **[[climate must be the
priority]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

#### It's our [last]{.underline}, [best bet]{.underline} to stop 2 degree warming.

[Texas prides itself on being different.]{.underline} [Yet it is in the
grip of a winter storm that typifies the **[Snowmageddon-size
problems]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[facing]{.underline} **[energy in
America]{.underline}**]{.mark}. [Although]{.underline} [nobody can be
sure if this particular freeze is a sign of **climate
change**]{.underline}, [the [growing **frequency of extreme weather**
]{.mark}**across the country is**]{.underline}. Texan [[infrastructure
has **buckled**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [The problem is not]{.underline},
as some argue, that Texas has [too many renewables]{.underline}.
Gas-fired plants and a nuclear reactor were hit, as well as wind
turbines. Worse, [Texas had too little capacity and its **poorly
connected grid** was unable to import power from elsewhere]{.underline}
(see article). [Texas shows that **[America needs both a cleaner grid
and a more reliable one.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[Plans to overhaul American energy will **come before
Congress**]{.underline} in the next few months. President Joe Biden has
said that he wants fossil-fuel emissions from power generation to end by
2035 and the economy to be carbon-neutral by 2050. [[America is]{.mark}
not just the world's second-largest **emitter**]{.underline}, [but also
[a source of]{.mark} **climate-related policy**]{.underline},
**[technology]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}, potentially,
**[[leadership]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[[What is about to unfold in
Washington]{.mark} [will set the course in America for the next
decade]{.mark}---[and]{.mark} quite possibly
[beyond]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

[**[Time is pressing]{.underline}**.]{.mark}
[[Neither]{.underline}]{.mark} Mr [[Biden nor]{.mark} his
[successors]{.mark} may [get a **second chance**]{.mark} to recast
policy on such a scale]{.underline}. Global emissions from fossil fuels
and cement production in 2019 were 16% higher than in 2009. [[It will be
**even harder**]{.underline} [to limit]{.underline}]{.mark} [climate
change [to less than 2°C]{.mark} above the pre-industrial level, the
global threshold from which America's target for 2050
comes]{.underline}. To be carbon neutral, the world must curb emissions
by 7.6% a year for a decade, a steeper decline than in 2020, when
covid-19 cut demand for oil and coal. [For America, [delaying
action]{.mark}]{.underline} to 2030 [[would]{.mark} nearly **double the
cost of reaching net zero**]{.underline} [or]{.underline}, **[more
likely]{.underline}**, [[mean it **overshoots**]{.mark} **its
targets.**]{.underline}

[Yet [there are grounds for **hope**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Although the
Republican Party is against almost all action, [voters are
**increasingly alarmed** by climate change]{.underline}.
**[Two-thirds]{.underline}** of them [think the federal government is
doing too little about it]{.underline}, [and that share includes
**plenty of younger Republicans**.]{.underline} Although the fossil-fuel
lobby remains powerful, [many Republican business donors want more
action]{.underline}---partly because asset managers are urging firms to
align their strategies with the net-zero world Mr Biden envisions.

[Most encouraging]{.underline} of all, [the costs of power from wind and
solar have **plunged by** 70% and **90% over the past
decade**]{.underline}. Along with cheap gas, [this has already helped
America decarbonise at an impressive rate]{.underline}, despite Donald
Trump's rolling back of fossil-fuel regulations. Price has not been the
only factor; [more than half of the states have some sort of
clean-energy mandate]{.underline}, a device that Mr [Biden wants to
introduce on a national scale.]{.underline}

[This involves a regulatory framework that favours **renewable-energy
developments**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[grid connections to
hook them up]{.underline}**. It will take a lot of extra
investment---about \$2.5trn in the coming decade, say researchers at
Princeton (see Briefing). In a new book, Bill Gates, a billionaire
philanthropist, argues that research is needed into a host of areas such
as energy storage, advanced nuclear reactors to complement renewables
and technologies for clean concrete-making and other activities that are
hard to decarbonise (see article). Without these, even if a clean grid
is powering electric cars and light trucks, it will displace only around
half of emissions.

**[America is good at innovation]{.underline}**, [but new ideas need to
be **deployed at scale**]{.underline}, not languish in the lab. One tool
is a carbon price which, if it were high enough and if investors
believed it would last, would signal what improvements were needed
where. But for all its attractions, carbon pricing failed in Congress in
2009. Although many economists and opinion-makers on the right favour
it, Republican politicians do not. And even if a carbon price were in
place, public-private co-operation would still be needed for America to
act as fast as Mr Biden proposes.

[For all those reasons]{.underline}, [[an]{.underline} **[ambitious
climate-oriented infrastructure bill]{.underline}** [looks
like]{.underline}]{.mark} Mr [[Biden's best chance]{.mark} of getting
new policy on climate through the Senate]{.underline}. Unfortunately
such a plan will be lucky to attract any Republican votes. Yet, if
mustering the 60 needed to see off a Senate filibuster is improbable, a
plan could be stripped of some measures, including a clean-energy
standard, and passed with a simple majority through the parliamentary
manoeuvre known as reconciliation. The bill must still be of a scale and
ambition that matches America's challenge.

[[Failure to act would bring **big risks**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [For a
start, [it would make America **less competitive**]{.mark} in the new
**clean-energy economy**]{.underline}. China is the dominant producer of
solar panels and batteries; it has also invested in foreign mines to
secure minerals needed for them. Europe has its own "green deal" to
boost its clean-energy industries. It plans to tax imports from
countries that do not pledge to lower their emissions.

[[America would also be deprived of]{.mark} **global [influence over
climate]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [It has direct control over
only about 10% of the world's greenhouse-gas effluvia]{.underline}. [If
it wants the benefit of a stabler climate]{.underline}---and with it a
stabler world economy, stabler geopolitics and much avoided
suffering---**[it needs to influence the other 90%, too.]{.underline}**
Mr Biden has appointed John Kerry, a former secretary of state, to
spearhead that effort (see Lexington). America is to rejoin the Paris
agreement on February 19th, making it a full participant in the un
conference to be held in Glasgow, in Scotland, in November, when
countries will be able to lodge new and more ambitious pledges to cut
emissions. [[If America tables]{.mark} [goals and **gives
evidence**]{.mark} that [it will **back them**]{.mark} with domestic
policy, **[it will gain influence]{.mark}**]{.underline}. China's two
big development banks have doled out \$51bn for foreign coal plants
since 2008. America should be part of a push against such subsidies.

Enough drifting

Unfortunately, [America brings little credibility to action on
climate]{.underline}. Mr [Trump took pleasure in subverting
it]{.underline}, but his country's poor record precedes him. George W.
Bush declined to implement the Kyoto protocol. Congress has not
considered serious climate legislation since 2009. **[Today must be
different]{.underline}**. [**[There will never be a better
chance]{.mark} for Mr Biden to show real ambition.** If the
**blackouts** in Texas are any guide, it would not just be the world
that would thank him, but **Americans, too.**]{.underline}

### !\-\--Conflict Multiplier

#### Warming's a [conflict multiplier]{.underline} 

**Scheffran 16**, Professor at the Institute for Geography at the
University of Hamburg and head of the Research Group Climate Change and
Security in the CliSAP Cluster of Excellence and the Center for Earth
System Research and Sustainability, et al (Jürgen, "The Climate-Nuclear
Nexus: Exploring the linkages between climate change and nuclear
threats,"
<http://www.worldfuturecouncil.org/file/2016/01/WFC_2015_The_Climate-Nuclear_Nexus.pdf>)

Climate change and nuclear weapons represent two key threats of our
time. [[Climate change endangers ecosystems]{.mark} and social systems
**[all over the world]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The [degradation
of]{.underline} natural [resources]{.underline}, the [[decline of water
and food]{.underline}]{.mark} supplies, [forced [migration]{.mark},
and]{.underline} more frequent and intense [[disasters]{.mark}
will]{.underline} greatly [affect population clusters]{.underline}, big
and small. [Climate-related shocks will **[add stress to]{.mark} the
world's existing [conflicts]{.mark}** [and **act as a "threat
multiplier**]{.mark}" in already fragile regions]{.underline}. [[This
could]{.mark} contribute to a **[decline]{.mark} of [international
stability]{.mark}** [and trigger **hostility
between**]{.mark}]{.underline} people and
**[[nations]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Meanwhile, the 15,500 [nuclear
weapons]{.underline} that remain in the arsenals of only a few states
[possess]{.underline} the [destructive force to **destroy life on
Earth**]{.underline} as we know multiple times over. [With]{.underline}
nuclear deterrence strategies still in place, and [hundreds of weapons
on 'hair trigger alert', the **[risks of nuclear war]{.mark}** caused
[by accident, miscalc]{.mark}ulation [or intent
remain]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[plentiful]{.mark} and
imminent]{.underline}**. Despite growing recognition that climate change
and nuclear weapons pose critical security risks, the linkages between
both threats are largely ignored. However, nuclear and climate risks
interfere with each other in a mutually enforcing way. [[Conflicts
induced by climate change could]{.mark} contribute to **global
insecurity**]{.underline}, which, in turn, could **[[enhance the
chance]{.mark} [of a nuclear weapon being used]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
could [[create]{.mark} more fertile breeding [grounds for]{.mark}
terrorism]{.underline}, [including **[nuclear
terrorism]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} could [feed the
ambitions among]{.underline} some [states to **acquire nuclear
arms**]{.underline}. Furthermore, as evidenced by a series of incidents
in recent years, extreme weather events, environmental degradation and
major seismic events can directly impact the safety and security of
nuclear installations. Moreover, a [nuclear war could lead to a
rapid]{.underline} and [prolonged drop in average global temperatures
and significantly disrupt the global climate for years]{.underline} to
come, which would have disastrous implications for agriculture,
**[threatening the food supply for most of the world]{.underline}**.
Finally, climate change, nuclear weapons and nuclear energy pose threats
of intergenerational harm, as evidenced by the transgenerational effects
of nuclear testing and nuclear power accidents and the lasting impacts
on the climate, environment and public health by carbon emissions.

### AT Paris Solves

#### Re-joining [alone]{.underline} is insufficient. That only solves if it's perceived as a credible and genuine commitment.

**Dennis 12-22**-2020 (Brady, "The U.S. will soon rejoin the Paris
climate accord. Then comes the hard part.," *Washington Post*,
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/12/22/biden-paris-climate-accord/>)//BB

[Leaders from 75 countries gathered]{.underline} this month ---
[virtually]{.underline}, of course --- [to mark the fifth anniversary of
the Paris climate accord and to outline more ambitious plans to cut
planet-warming emissions]{.underline} in the critical years ahead. The
United Kingdom vowed to stop funding fossil fuel projects abroad. The
European Union said it will push to cut emissions 55 percent by 2030.
Canada detailed plans to ramp up its tax on carbon to more than \$130
per ton over the same period. A handful of smaller countries pledged to
reach net-zero emissions by 2035, if not sooner. Three dozen nations
have declared a "climate emergency" inside their borders. "[They
recognize the urgency and the stakes]{.underline}," said António
Guterres, secretary general of the United Nations. "**[It's time for all
countries to do the same]{.underline}**." Dangerous new hot zones are
spreading around the world [The one glaring absence at the anniversary
gathering: the United States]{.underline}. The nation that has
historically spewed more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere than any
other, and the only country to withdraw from the global pact, was
nowhere in sight. But just before the Dec. 12 event got underway,
President-elect Joe [Biden blasted out]{.underline} a statement, [vowing
to rejoin the Paris agreement "on day one" and to restore the United
States as a world leader in climate action]{.underline}. "I'll
immediately start working with my counterparts around the world to do
all that we possibly can, including by convening the leaders of major
economies for a climate summit within my first 100 days in office," he
said. Biden promised to put the nation on a path to achieve net-zero
emissions by 2050, to ensure that the shift toward cleaner energy brings
new U.S. jobs, and to "listen to and engage closely with the activists,
including young people, who have continued to sound the alarm and demand
change from those in power." [Biden's promises no doubt provided
relief]{.underline} to many world leaders, who are eager for the United
States to rejoin an effort that remains far from meeting the goals
forged five years ago in Paris. [But [Biden **may not find as warm a
reception** as he hopes]{.mark} when the United States steps back onto
the global stage in 2021]{.underline}. Instead, [[he is likely to
encounter a **hopeful but wary world**]{.underline}]{.mark}. "**[[The
U.S. has to do a lot to rebuild trust]{.underline}]{.mark}**," said
Harjeet Singh, global climate lead for the advocacy group ActionAid.
"**[[It really needs to find a way to convince the world that this time,
the U.S. is genuine]{.underline}]{.mark}**ly ready to do its share."
[Many]{.underline} in the international community [have harbored
resentment about the United States' seeming inability]{.underline}, or
unwillingness, [[to live up to its]{.underline}]{.mark} lofty
[[promises]{.underline}]{.mark} to the rest of the world when it comes
to climate change. President Trump announced early in his tenure that he
would withdraw the nation from the Paris accord --- insisting that
following through with the nonbinding pledges of the Obama era could
economically disadvantage the country. But the United States has wavered
even before Trump, most notably on a key global climate treaty forged in
1997, known as the Kyoto Protocol. The United States signed that global
climate treaty in 1998 under the Clinton administration, but did not
ratify the deal and backed away from it under President George W. Bush.
Over the years, the United States has failed to hit its own
emissions-cutting targets --- even as overall emissions have decreased.
It also has not adequately contributed to a fund meant to help
vulnerable nations that have done little to cause climate change but are
most affected by it. President Bill Clinton makes a statement
celebrating the Kyoto Protocol on climate change on "[There's no
papering it over]{.underline}," John Holdren, an environmental policy
professor at Harvard who served as President Barack Obama's top science
adviser, [said of the loss of trust the United States has suffered
internationally during the Trump era]{.underline}. "**[[It's going to
involve more than just saying we are back]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[[We
are going to have to demonstrate we are back, and we are going to have
to demonstrate it powerfully]{.underline}]{.mark}**."

## !---China tech scenario 

### IL -- Dems k2 solve 

#### Only dem lead congress pushes through China tech bill that's k2 competition

**Editorial 22**, 2-1-2022, \"Opinion,\" Washington Post,
https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/02/01/democrats-want-win-tech-war-with-china-best-way-is-bolster-us-allies/

House Democrats are poised to vote this week on a massive bill designed
to [best China in high technology and preserve U.S. access to critical
goods]{.underline}. The America Competes Act would [direct billions into
technological research and manufacturing, improving education, and
stockpiling critical items such as prescription drugs and personal
protective equipment.]{.underline} A hefty 68-to-32 majority passed a
similar bill in the Senate last June, making it likely some version of
this legislation will reach President Biden's desk this year. Sign up
for a weekly roundup of thought-provoking ideas and debates But many
issues still need to be worked out between the chambers, and the details
could make it substantially better --- or much worse. The House bill
would [pump money into federal agencies to fund a dizzying array of
research initiative]{.underline}s: nanoscience, quantum computing,
artificial intelligence, climate technology, even biometric
identification systems. The bill would also make it easier for
scientists and engineers to stay in the country, a long-needed update to
the nation's irrational immigration laws. More questionable is the
bill's provision allocating \$52 billion to onshore semiconductor
fabrication. While the United States remains a leader in semiconductor
research, the country manufactures only 12 percent of the chips that run
everything from toasters to Toyotas. A recent semiconductor shortage has
driven up the price of cars and other consumer goods; to many, this
painful bout of inflation underlines the risk of allowing China to
consolidate control over industries that the United States should
consider strategic, such as chipmaking. Indeed, \$52 billion may seem
like too small a response to China's recently announced \$150 billion
program to establish more chip production facilities inside its borders.
In fact, however, the United States cannot meet China dollar for dollar,
and it should not try. Much of China's chips money will be wasted as the
country tries to create artificially many of the advantages the United
States already has, such as a concentration of expertise, an advanced
research and development ecosystem, and the free flow of capital.
[Congress should double down on these advantages by funding the
development of the next generation of chips that might render obsolete
the ones lawmakers are currently worried about manufacturing, as other
provisions of the bill would do, and cracking down on Chinese
intellectual property theft]{.underline}. Meantime, if lawmakers are
going to make chip manufacturing a top national priority, they should
pursue a broader strategy. The bill's backers argue that the United
States cannot ignore the possibility that the Chinese regime will corner
the market on manufacturing critical components, then use that economic
power to bully the world. The best response would be to coordinate with
friendly trading partners, such as the European Union, Japan, Korea and
Taiwan, to ensure that sufficient manufacturing capacity remains outside
China. The legislation's proponents argue that the United States must
still ensure that more chips are produced here, so that disruption in
one link in the supply chain --- if, for example, U.S. ports slow, as
they did during the pandemic --- does not cause another punishing
shortage. It is not clear this risk justifies massive new onshoring
subsidies. But if lawmakers are determined to approve them, they must
attach substantial strings. Federal agencies should have broad authority
to manage government aid --- and terminate funding to failing firms.
Otherwise taxpayers may get paltry returns on their investment.

#### Necessary and sufficient\-\--now is key

**Anderson** 3-9-20**21**, Chairman & CEO of CG/LA Infrastructure, a
firm focused on global infrastructure project development, driving
productivity across countries, and maximizing the benefits of
infrastructure for people in the U.S. and around the world (Norman, "AI
& The Biden Infrastructure Plan - How To Invest In Our Future," Forbes,
<https://www.forbes.com/sites/normananderson/2021/03/09/ai-and-infrastructurethe-schmidt-report--the-wild-blue-yonder/?sh=357facf8366b>)

[Last week was a bad week for democracy]{.underline}, and for liberty
[globally]{.underline} - but hopefully a wake-up call for all of us.
[[The Schmidt]{.underline}]{.mark} AI [[Report highlighted]{.mark} a
huge danger in [how quickly we could fall behind China in AI]{.mark},
across the board, [and]{.mark}]{.underline} - especially from my point
of view - in the area of [[infrastructure]{.underline}]{.mark}. China's
National People's Congress - no way to sugarcoat this - set out goals,
and a confident plan, for becoming the leading economy across the board,
and across the world, with average 6% growth through to the end of the
decade (U.S. growth is barely 1/3 of that, and we don't set goals
anyway). [To top off the week Freedom House released their annual report
showing an increase in the velocity of the fifteen year decline in
democracy around the world]{.underline} - "[[The malign influence
of]{.mark} the regime in [China]{.mark}]{.underline}, the world's most
populous dictatorship, [[was especially profound]{.mark} in
2020]{.underline}." This is not a good set of facts. What does AI have
to do with infrastructure and investment? Everything. By focusing on the
digitization and electrification of infrastructure we can drive an
industrial Renaissance, turbo-charging a sustained period of
productivity growth and opportunity creation. The best way to start is
to unleash an AI mini moonshot on infrastructure by opening up the
sector's investment potential: addressing regulation (speed,
transparency), so that great projects can be approved quickly;
identifying best practices, so that the death valley of construction
risk is minimized, or obliterated; and highlighting priority brownfield
projects - digitizing and electrifying the \$33 trillion in invested
assets (the interstate highway system, our transmission network, our
ports and waterways) - so that we finally put our industrial commons in
a position to compete globally. From Infrastructure to Neuralstructure.
In my book, Vision - Our Strategic Infrastructure Roadmap Forward, I
highlight this shift from physical infrastructure - roads, bridges,
power plants as foundational to our productivity - to something that
might be called 'neuralstructure,' in which 5G, AI and Machine Learning
create an end to end, coast to coast, logistics network - the brains
enabling a new era of economic productivity. This is where our
attention, our dollars and our innovation should go This injection of
intelligence into everything from roads to transmission networks, in
which these networks become the brains of the economy, also means -
quite obviously - that new infrastructure investment is no longer a
supporting investment, but a first order strategic priority. This in
turn means that the way we think about that investment needs to leapfrog
past the way we thought about it in the past. This has already happened
in most industries, of course - we don't even think about all of the
intelligence behind banking, or consumer advertising. Now this change is
coming to the physical world - it's going to happen fast, and it will
easily be the biggest economic shift in 120 years. One of the quickest
bangs for our buck is investment in a new logistics system. This is a
\$12 trillion global market - and sized at \$2 trillion in the the U.S.
By electrifying and digitizing our highways, we enable local distributed
and advanced manufacturing - the industrial equivalent of farm to table.
We also create an industrial logic that makes deep environmental sense,
bringing manufacturing (and well-paying jobs) back home rather than
shuttling goods back and forth across the Pacific. Panasonic's March 8th
purchase, for \$6.5 billion, of the software logistics firm Blue Yonder
gives you a glimpse of how quickly industry will embrace this
potential - as long as we quickly make progress on the right
infrastructure investments. It can't continue to take 9.5 years to
approve a new smart highway - how do we get things done with 2030 as the
outside of the envelope? Here are three priorities that can focus this
effort: Priority 1 - Focus on Strategic Projects/Mini Moonshots. Above
all, we have to get moving - waiting for a \$3-4 trillion infrastructure
bill, based on tax increases, is meager gruel for a great country. A
series of mini moonshots, focused on strategic advances, will build our
confidence, build trust between the public and private sectors, and
create real capacity. Here are three candidates: Arizona's Technology
Highway, uniting Reno and Las Vegas - and the Port of Oakland and the
Port of LA/Long Beach; The Great Basin Logistics Project, creating an
integrated rail, highway and airport corridor around greater Chicago;
and the Autonomy Institute's plan to create 5G-enabled autonomous truck
lanes on the 50,000 miles of the U.S. Interstate Highway System. Think
of what this would do for people's investment plans - and for our
country's confidence! Utilizing U.S. Pension Funds for Infrastructure
Investment Growth of U.S. Pension Fund Assets STATISTA Priority 2 -
Unleash Investment. Right now it is difficult to bring pension fund or
other private investments to priority projects, since nobody knows a)
how long the approval process will take, b) whether it will be
interrupted capriciously, and c) whether someone will throw a wrench
into the process even after that happens. You cannot overestimate the
chilling effect that the pre-digital and easily manipulated approvals
process has on investors. At the same time, we have a powerful
public/private opportunity: Privately, our \$32 trillion in pension fund
assets (projected to exceed \$55 trillion in ten years) can be quickly
brought to bear on a robust pipeline of key projects; Publicly, we have
enormous available resources support these investments, including from
the Department of Commerce (a revitalized Economic Development
Administration); the Department of Transportation (TIFIA, and the Build
America Bureau); and the Department of Energy (especially the loan
guarantee program). Priority 3 - Use Muscle Memory. A great strength is
that the U.S. has navigated through turbulence and uncertainty in the
past - our national identify is defined by these successes. We know we
are good at this, and need to build a vision for the future based on
these successes: launching a new economy in 1900, navigating the
transition to automobiles and airplanes; rebuilding an economy in the
1930's, recovering from economic collapse to win a war; and doing
something extraordinary in the 1960's, erasing economic uncertainty by
galvanizing the pride of an entire country around the Apollo moon
mission. A Hinge Moment in History. [**[This is a hinge moment in
history]{.underline}**,]{.mark} and one that - with the right vision,
bringing us all together - can take us to the Promised Land. It feels a
lot like what 1901 must have felt like (this is easy to say, of course,
since no-one alive knows what that felt like): a moment of great
promise, tremendous dislocation, huge optimism. I am optimistic, but
concerned\.... Two things have to happen if we are going to mobilize our
country to effectively create the next great American economy. First, we
[[have to recognize that]{.underline}]{.mark} new **[[infrastructure is
a first order issue]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[and]{.mark} [create a
predictable pipeline of projects]{.mark} [so]{.mark} that
[investment]{.mark}]{.underline} - especially pension fund investment -
[[can take place efficiently,]{.mark} [and]{.mark} as
[cheaply]{.mark}]{.underline} as possible. [[Getting this right is
**clearly a national security priority**]{.mark} as well - nobody ever
built a secure economy on a weak economy]{.underline}. Second, we live
in a Madisonian Republic, and along with technocratic leadership driving
industrial strategy and direction, [[we need]{.mark} active and [engaged
Congressional involvement]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} and that will
involve the return of earmarks - there is nothing wrong with that, it is
how democracy actually works.

[The system must]{.underline} also [be adapted to deal with]{.underline}
new issues that were not envisioned when the existing order was
designed. Foremost among these issues is [emerging and disruptive
technology, including **[AI]{.mark}**, **additive
manufacturing**]{.underline} (or **[[3D

[**[genetic engineering]{.mark}**, **robotics**, [**directed energy**,
the]{.mark}]{.underline} Internet of things ([[**IOT**), **5G**,
**space**, **cyber**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and many others. Like other
disruptive technologies before them, [these innovations [promise]{.mark}
great [benefits, but]{.mark} also [carry]{.mark} **serious downside
[risks]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For example, AI is already resulting in
massive efficiencies and cost savings in the private sector. Routine
tasks and other more complicated jobs, such as radiology, are already
being automated. In the future, autonomous weapons systems may go to war
against each other as human soldiers remain out of harm's way. Yet, [AI
is]{.underline} also transforming economies and societies, and
[generating new security challenges]{.underline}. Automation will lead
to widespread unemployment. The final realization of driverless cars,
for example, will put out of work millions of taxi, Uber, and long-haul
truck drivers. Populist movements in the West have been driven by those
disaffected by globalization and technology, and mass unemployment
caused by automation will further grow those ranks and provide new fuel
to grievance politics. Moreover, some fear that [[autonomous
weapons]{.underline}]{.mark} systems will become "killer robots" that
select and engage targets without human input, and [[could]{.mark}
eventually **[turn on]{.mark} their [creators, resulting in]{.mark}
human [extinction]{.mark}**. The other technologies on this lisgt
similarly balance great potential upside with great downside risk. [3D
printing]{.mark}]{.underline}, for example, can be used to "make
anything anywhere," reducing costs for a wide range of manufactured
goods and encouraging a return of local manufacturing industries.61 At
the same time, advanced 3D printers [[can]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[be
used by]{.mark} revisionist and [rogue states to print]{.mark} component
parts for advanced weapons systems or]{.underline} even
[[WMD]{.underline}]{.mark} programs, **[[spurring arms races and]{.mark}
weapons [prolif]{.mark}eration]{.underline}**.62 [**[G]{.mark}**enetic
**[e]{.mark}**ngineering [can]{.mark}]{.underline} wipe out entire
classes of disease through improved medicine, or [[wipe out]{.mark}
entire [classes of people]{.mark} through genetically engineered
superbugs. [Directed-energy]{.mark} missile defenses [may]{.mark} defend
against incoming missile attacks, while]{.underline} also
**[[undermin]{.mark}ing [global]{.mark} strategic
[stability]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Perhaps [the [greatest risk]{.mark}
to global strategic stability from new technology]{.underline}, however,
[[comes from]{.mark} the [risk]{.mark}]{.underline} that **[revisionist
[autocracies]{.mark} may [win the]{.mark} new [tech]{.mark} arms
[race]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Throughout history, [[states that have
dominated]{.underline}]{.mark} the commanding heights of
[[tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nological progress [[have also
dominated]{.mark} **[i]{.mark}**]{.underline}nternational
**[[r]{.underline}]{.mark}**elations. The United States has been the
world's innovation leader from Edison's light bulb to nuclear weapons
and the Internet. Accordingly, [[stability has been maintained
in]{.mark} [Europe and Asia]{.mark}]{.underline} for decades [[because
the **U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[[and its democratic allies possessed a favorable]{.mark} economic and
military [balance of power]{.mark}]{.underline} in those key regions.
Many believe, however, that China may now have the lead in the new
technologies of the twenty-first century, including AI, quantum, 5G,
hypersonic missiles, and others. [[If]{.mark} [China succeeds in
mastering]{.mark} the [tech]{.mark}nologies of the future [**before**
the democratic core]{.mark}]{.underline}, then [[this could lead to
a]{.mark} drastic and [**rapid shift in the balance of power**,
upsetting]{.mark} **[global strategic stability]{.mark}**, and the call
for a democratic- led, rules-based system]{.underline} outlined in these

scale]{.mark}]{.underline}**, as in the Napoleonic Wars, World War I,
and World War II. [[Since]{.underline}]{.mark} 1945, however, [[there
have been **zero**]{.mark} **great-power wars**]{.underline}. As shown
in Figure 1, [the percentage of people killed in armed conflict has
drastically declined in the post-World War II era]{.underline}. [Armed
conflict killed an average of 1--2 percent of the human population from
1600 to 1945]{.underline}. [During the Cold War, an average of **0.4
percent**]{.underline} [of the world's population perished due to
war]{.underline}. [Since]{.underline} the year 2000, [less than **one
one-hundredth of 1 percent of people**]{.underline} [have died this
way]{.underline}.8 [Under a rules-based system,]{.underline} [the world
has continued to make progress in reducing deaths from all kinds of
war,]{.underline} including often-intractable civil conflicts.9 Turning
to economic prosperity, the global gross domestic product (GDP) per
capita in 1945 was \$4,079.10 Today it is \$11,570.11 This drastic
increase in global living standards is evident in Figure 2. The share of
the global population living in poverty has dramatically decreased. In
1929, the number of people living in extreme poverty (defined as earning
less than 1.90 international dollars per day) was 1.35 billion, almost
two-thirds of the world population at the time. In 2015, that figure was
733.48 million, or slightly less than 10 percent of the world
population.12 China itself has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of
this system, as geopolitical stability in Asia and integration into the
global economy helped to lift four hundred million Chinese out of
poverty. [In the realm of **good governance,**]{.underline} [the number
of democracies has]{.underline} substantially [increased]{.underline}.
With the end of World War II and decolonization, the number of
democracies increased from seventeen to forty-eight between 1945 and
1989.13 That number further skyrocketed at the end of the Cold War, as
countries formerly behind the Iron Curtain rushed to join the West. [In
the year 1900,]{.underline} [there were twelve democracies in the
world]{.underline}. [Today there are **ninety-six.**]{.underline}14 The
percentage of the world's population living under democratic governments
has also increased from about 12 percent in 1900 to more than 55 percent
today.15 This trend is visible in Figure 3. To be sure, these outcomes
are the result of an enormous and interconnected range of factors.
**[I]{.underline}**nternational-**[r]{.underline}**elations
[scholars]{.underline}, for example, [believe]{.underline} that [nuclear
deterrence]{.underline} and the absence of a multipolar distribution of
power also [contributed to great-power peace]{.underline}.16 In
addition, globalization and economic development have been fueled by new
technological developments. Further, global norms on democratic
governance and human rights have come a long way since the early
twentieth century.17 [Still, [it is doubtful]{.mark}
whether]{.underline} [[this dramatic]{.mark} [improvement]{.mark} in the
human condition]{.underline} [[could have been achieved]{.mark} [in the
absence of the]{.mark}]{.underline} [rules-based international
[system]{.mark}]{.underline}. Moreover, many of these **[other driving
forces are]{.underline}** themselves **[constitutive of,]{.underline}**
if not partially the result of, **[that system]{.underline}**. Global
bipolarity, and then unipolarity with the United States at its center,
was critical for [the postwar development of **[a rules-based
system]{.mark}**]{.underline}, which **[[may not have been
possible]{.underline}]{.mark}** in a more multipolar distribution of
international power, or **[[with a non-democratic
hegemon]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[at the]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[system's [apex]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The splitting of the atom
could have resulted in widespread nuclear-weapons proliferation and
nuclear use had it not been for the NPT and extended US nuclear
deterrence in Europe and Asia.18 The most important technological
advances for globalization, including the Internet, occurred and
flourished in the free world, defended by the United States and its
democratic allies and partners.19 Finally, the United States and its
[[democratic partners]{.underline}]{.mark}, along with nongovernmental
organizations and individuals operating in these states, [were the
**most important norm entrepreneurs [propagat]{.mark}ing
global**]{.underline} norms around issues of **[[good
governance]{.mark},]{.underline}** democracy, and human rights. In sum,
[the rules-based]{.underline} international system that has been the
defining feature of [global order]{.underline} for the past seventy
years has coincided with---and [was]{.underline} almost certainly
**[essential]{.underline}** [in bringing]{.underline} about---**[the
most secure]{.underline}**, prosperous, [and well-governed
world]{.underline} [humanity has ever known]{.underline}. [Despite
this]{.underline} [record of unprecedented and enduring
success]{.underline}[, [the rules-based]{.underline}]{.mark}
international [system [is currently besieged]{.mark} by]{.underline} a
number of [challenges]{.underline} unleashed by rapid and dramatic
global change. [Understanding]{.underline} the [current]{.underline}
strategic context, including [global]{.underline} trends and
[threats]{.underline} both external and internal [to [the system's
**democratic core**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[is]{.mark} a
**[necessary]{.mark} first step**]{.underline}
[[to]{.underline}]{.mark}ward devising a strategy to revitalize, adapt,
and [[defend a rules-based international system]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Global Diffusion of Power. The international distribution of power, as
defined by relative economic weight, is shifting away from the founders
of the post-World War II system to other emerging economies. As recently
as the 1990s, nearly 70 percent of global economic activity occurred in
Europe and the Americas. By the 2040s, that number is expected to drop
to roughly 40 percent. At the same time, the Asian share of global GDP
will increase from 32 percent at present to 53 percent in 2050, meaning
that, by that time, the majority of all economic activity on Earth will
occur in Asia. While the United States remains the world's most powerful
state militarily and economically, it is declining relative to other
rising powers, particularly China. When corrected for purchasing-power
parity (PPP), China's GDP has already surpassed the United States. The
better metric for international power and influence, however, is real
GDP; here, too, the US advantage is narrowing, but more slowly.21 At the
conclusion of World War II, the United States possessed roughly 50
percent of global GDP.22 From the 1970s through today, that number has
held steady at roughly 25 percent.23 Despite a common misperception, the
United States' share of global power is not declining in absolute terms.
Rather, other powers---especially China---are rising. China's share of
global GDP rose from 4.6 percent in the 1990s to 15 percent today.24
Many economists predict that China could surpass the United States as
the world's largest economy by 2030. It is noteworthy, however, that in
2009, economists predicted that this transition would happen by 2020.
That date has been pushed back a decade as Chinese growth has slowed.
Future projections depend entirely on assumptions about growth rates in
the United States and China that cannot be known with certainty. Still,
most economists expect that China will, at some point, surpass the
United States as the world's largest economy. China is joined by other
emerging economies with rapid growth rates, including India, Indonesia,
and others. US allies, including Japan, Germany, and the United Kingdom,
remain among the wealthiest nations on Earth, but their share of global
power is also declining relative to the rise of the rest. This shift is
significant because international orders function best when their formal
attributes at least roughly reflect the underlying balance of power.
While only one measure of global influence, economic power is central
given the leverage it provides over trade and investment, and the
resources it offers to sustain military and security advantages. [It is
also important to point out]{.underline}, [however, that]{.underline}
the United States and its formal treaty allies continue to possess a
preponderance of power in the international system. As Figure 4 shows,
the United States and its formal allies currently produce 59 percent of
global GDP. When including other countries considered to be
"democracies" by the widely used Polity scores, that number rises to 75
percent of global GDP. [Democracies continue to retain global
influence]{.underline} [because more countries have transitioned to
democracy since the end of the Cold War]{.underline}, and overall
economic growth in democratic countries has outpaced that in autocratic
states since 1991. [[The]{.mark}]{.underline} major
[[shift]{.underline}]{.mark} [since the dawn of the post-Cold War
world]{.underline}, [therefore,]{.underline} [[is not
that]{.underline}]{.mark} the power of the United States and its
[[democratic]{.mark}]{.underline} allies and [[partners has
declined]{.mark} substantially]{.underline}. [[The]{.mark}
major]{.underline} [[difference is that the share possessed by
**autocratic challengers**]{.underline}]{.mark}, **[especially
[China]{.mark},]{.underline}** [[has grown]{.mark}.]{.underline} As
Figure 4 shows, the world is approaching a more bipolar distribution of
power, with more wealth concentrated in the democracies and in a
grouping of autocratic challengers led by China. [This means
that]{.underline}, if they are able to work together more cohesively,
the United States and its [[democratic]{.underline}]{.mark} allies and
[[partners]{.mark} [still have the power]{.mark} and influence necessary
[to]{.mark}]{.underline} significantly [[shape]{.mark} international
[outcomes]{.mark}.]{.underline} Moreover, if they are able to expand
their ranks to court other nonaligned democracies like India, Indonesia,
and Mexico, their influence on the international system can be even more
decisive. Disruptive Technologies. New technologies---including
artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, quantum computing, and biotech,
among others---are being developed at an exponential pace, and have the
promise to transform society. They will determine how people live and
function in the twenty-first century, significantly shaping the global
economy, international security, and the course of geopolitics.
Throughout history, progress has been built on technological innovation,
ranging from Thomas Edison's light bulb to Henry Ford's assembly line to
the silicon chip, the personal computer, and the Internet. While [[new
technology]{.underline}]{.mark} promises improved productivity and
quality of life, it [[will bring serious downside
risks]{.underline}]{.mark}, including economic dislocation and weapons
proliferation. AI, for example, is already being widely adopted in the
private sector to achieve great efficiencies and cost savings.25 At the
same time, automation threatens to put millions out of work as jobs once
performed by humans are replaced by machines. Moreover, [[AI
is]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[being introduced]{.underline}]{.mark}
in[[to]{.mark} national [militaries]{.mark}.]{.underline} A logical next
step is fully autonomous weapons that can select and engage targets
without a human in the decision-making loop. Some warn that
[[these]{.mark}]{.underline} "[killer [robots]{.mark}"
[introduce]{.mark} many]{.underline} ethical and [[security
risks]{.underline}]{.mark}, including the fear that they may turn on
their creators **[[and]{.mark} threaten [human]{.mark}s' very
[existence]{.mark}]{.underline}** or, indeed, what it means to be
human.26 Henry Kissinger warns, "We are in danger of losing the capacity
that has been the essence of human cognition."27 [[The existing]{.mark}
international [system was designed to deal with]{.mark}]{.underline} the
most [important [dual-use tech]{.mark}nologies]{.underline} of the
twentieth century, such as nuclear power, [[but it must be
updated]{.underline}]{.mark} to deal with the technologies of the
twenty-first century. As with nuclear energy, [[the international
community needs]{.underline}]{.mark} an entirely new set of
international [[norms]{.underline}]{.mark}, standards, [and
agreements]{.underline} for responsible uses of new technologies [[that
mitigate]{.underline}]{.mark} their [downside
[risks]{.mark}]{.underline}, [while maximizing their upside
potential.]{.underline} Since the time of Edison, the United States has
been the world's most innovative country, but it is at risk of losing
that title to China and other countries that aim for the first-mover
advantage in the next round of technological breakthroughs. Throughout
history, technological progress and international leadership have gone
hand in hand. Think of roads and aqueducts in ancient Rome, the steam
engine in nineteenth-century Great Britain, and the Internet in the
United States. [[If China]{.underline}]{.mark} or another country
[[takes the lead]{.underline}]{.mark} in the new tech arms race,
[[Beijing may]{.mark} be in a better position **to [rewrite the]{.mark}
international [system's rules]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Nuclear
Proliferation. Even as the world grapples with the technological
challenges of the twenty-first century, century-old technological
challenges remain. The NPT may be the most successful treaty in history,
but its future is uncertain. North Korea has become the only country in
history to sign the treaty, withdraw, and build nuclear weapons. If
North Korea is allowed to become an accepted nuclear-weapons state, it
would pose a severe threat to international peace and security. Other
members of the treaty may also reconsider their nuclear options. In
particular, South Korea and Japan may be at risk of pursuing
nuclear-weapons programs if the program in Pyongyang continues to
advance and the United States is unwilling or unable to provide Seoul
and Tokyo with adequate security assurances. Iran's nuclear program was
allowed to operate within strict limits according to the terms of the
Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), but the US withdrawal from
that agreement may lead Tehran to accelerate its nuclear program or dash
to achieve a nuclear weapon. A bomb in Iran could also instigate further
regional nuclear proliferation.28 Officials in Saudi Arabia, for
example, have declared that if Iran acquires nuclear weapons, Riyadh
will follow suit. A proliferation cascade in East Asia or the Middle
East would undermine the global nonproliferation regime and fuel
regional insecurity. Moreover, new technologies such as additive
manufacturing may make it easier for future proliferators to build
nuclear-weapons programs, and harder for the international community to
catch and stop them.29 The additional spread of a weapon that remains
the ultimate instrument of military force could threaten the global
security and stability necessary for the smooth functioning of the
rules-based international system. Ecological Disaster. **[[As with
nuclear war]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[an ecological disaster could
constitute a direct threat to humanity's]{.underline}]{.mark} very
[[existence]{.mark}.]{.underline} While states have made efforts to
address climate change caused by carbon emissions, including in the
Paris Climate Agreement, these steps will not be sufficient to keep
emissions below the target levels set by leading scientific panels.
Higher average global temperatures are leading to rising sea levels,
drought, an increased frequency of violent storms, and forced
migrations, all of which are threatening vulnerable societies,
undermining already-weak national governments, and contributing to
conflicts over natural resources.

#### Dems winning midterms allows for renegotiating bills to solve for the looming recession

Tony **Romm 22**, 6-27-2022, \"Democrats race to revive economic package
as inflation spikes,\" Washington Post,
https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2022/06/27/manchin-schumer-build-back-better/

With [inflation on the rise and the threat of a recession
looming]{.underline}, congressional [Democrats are scrambling to revive
their long-stalled economic spending package, hoping to deliver relief
to Americans whose finances have soured during months of political
bickering]{.underline}. When [Democrats last tried to advance the
party's \$2 trillion initiative]{.underline} in December, hoping to
overhaul the nation's health-care, education, climate and tax laws, [the
economy seemed to be booming]{.underline}: Stocks traded high, gas
prices were low and lawmakers saw an opening to advance the measure then
known as the Build Back Better Act. More than six months later, however,
[the economy has shifted considerably]{.underline}. Along with Russia's
invasion of Ukraine and another resurgence of the coronavirus, the
nation faces soaring costs for housing, gasoline, groceries and other
goods, all made worse by the specter of another downturn. The [economic
peril has fueled new urgency on Capitol Hill]{.underline}, where
Democrats hope to resolve their differences, re-craft their agenda and
deliver before fall on at least some of the promises they made in the
last election. "It's essential to do because it responds to pocketbook
concerns right now --- financial concerns right now, it [moves to cut
costs right now --- and it also lays the foundation for these smarter
approaches for the future]{.underline}," said Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.),
the leader of the tax-focused Senate Finance Committee. How the White
House lost Joe Manchin, and its plan to transform America The chief
obstacle remains Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.), a moderate whose
opposition last year scuttled President Biden's agenda. Manchin has
huddled privately and repeatedly with Senate Majority Leader Charles E.
Schumer (D-N.Y.) in recent weeks, as [Democrats labor anew to secure his
must-have vote on a scaled-back bill]{.underline} that they hope to
bring to the floor in July. Manchin has remained steadfast in his belief
that the U.S. government should spend less, and raise more, than others
in his party prefer. Increasingly, Democrats believe they will end up
with a package far smaller in scope than they first envisioned --- one
focused on lowering prescription drug prices and combating climate
change, with spending financed through changes to tax laws that also cut
the deficit. But many of the key details are still unresolved,
generating fresh discomfort among lawmakers. In a sign of the lingering
schisms, a broadly supported attempt to lower the price of health
insurance by extending subsidies under the Affordable Care Act remains
at risk of falling out of the package entirely. The loss of those tax
credits could result in premium increases for millions of Americans next
year. The delays and doubts have only compounded Democrats' frustrations
after they had to abandon plans to lessen the price of housing, make
child care more affordable and push the development of energy sources
that can be alternatives to expensive gas --- ideas, they say, that
might have made a difference with a potential recession on the horizon.
"You know how strongly I felt about Build Back Better as we passed it.
... None of that has changed," said Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), the
leader of the left-leaning Congressional Progressive Caucus. "What I
also know is that we desperately need to deliver on some big policies
immediately. "Much to my chagrin, we have one person that didn't want to
vote for the deal that had been agreed to, but we need that one person,"
she added. "We need to pass the maximum we can pass that's going to make
a real difference for people." For Democrats, [the economic challenges
are immense as a slow-motion crisis comes into view]{.underline}. This
year, [inflation has reached a nearly half-century high]{.underline},
and gas prices in particular have soared due to geopolitical
instability. The Dow Jones industrial average, meanwhile, has lost more
than 5,000 points since the start of the year, part of a broad market
slump that has hit even the once-burgeoning tech industry hard. Hoping
to cool a hot economy, the Federal Reserve has responded aggressively in
recent weeks with steep interest rate increases. That may eventually
bring prices down, but only after making mortgages and other borrowing
more expensive for Americans. Higher rates could also slow a hiring boom
brought about by trillions of dollars in federal stimulus spending over
the past two years, some under Biden's watch. [The situation didn't seem
as dire last year]{.underline}, when Democrats last tried to advance
their agenda. Many in the party saw their proposed spending as a way to
shore up the economy --- offering financial help to Americans already
grappling with high costs in the wake of the pandemic. But Manchin
argued then that the economic package would add to the debt and worsen
inflation. Although the House passed its \$2 trillion version of the
measure in November, the Senate ultimately concluded the year without
even holding a vote. Since then, Democrats have insisted they are not
giving up, even as time begins to run out. They have about three months
to broker the sort of compromise that has eluded them for more than a
year; otherwise, [they may lose the ability to adopt the bill under a
special legislative tactic that allows them to bypass a GOP filibuster
in the Senate]{.underline}. To speed up their efforts, the party's
lawmakers are already huddling with the Senate's parliamentarian, hoping
to ensure their final package works within the confines of the process
known as reconciliation, according to two people familiar with the
matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the talks.
Speaking to reporters Wednesday, Schumer stressed after his latest
meeting with Manchin that they are having "very good and productive
discussions, but there are still some issues that have to be resolved."
Sam Runyon, a spokesman for Manchin, added in a statement that the
senator "continues to engage in respectful conversations about the best
way to move our country forward but is still seriously concerned about
harmful inflation taxes hurting Americans and our nation's lack of
energy security." Democrats scramble to resurrect 'chunks' of \$2
trillion spending plan backed by Biden In the meantime, though, the
stakes in their deliberations have grown exponentially higher. The party
now faces an even tougher balancing act as it looks to whittle down a
roughly \$2 trillion package in a way that lowers costs, satisfies
Manchin's whims and shores up the economy --- without making inflation
worse. "Anything that Congress does that adds to inflation will lead to
more interest rate increases," said Jason Furman, an economist at
Harvard University who previously advised President Barack Obama.
"Anything Congress does to take the pressure off inflation will
consequently lead the Fed not to raise interest rates as much. This is
much more of an interaction between fiscal and monetary policy than one
would have expected a year ago." Some of the ideas Democrats initially
proposed might have offered more of a direct, immediate financial
reprieve from rising prices --- including, for example, restoring
expanded monthly tax credit payments to families with children. The
pandemic-era program expired last year partly because Manchin objected
to renewing it, which economists say has cut deeply into families'
finances and raised the risks of child poverty. "If you expanded the
child tax credit the way we did ... wouldn't that help families pay for
child care, for prescription drugs, for school supplies for kids?" asked
Rep. Rosa L. DeLauro (D-Conn.), a leading advocate for the tax credit
and the chairwoman of the House Appropriations Committee. Democrats had
also proposed more than \$166 billion to construct new homes and help
low-income Americans pay their rents and mortgages in the original Build
Back Better Act. That would have marked the largest-ever federal
investment in housing affordability, clinching what might have been a
key policy before rental prices reached record highs in some major
cities. "There's no part of the country that has enough affordable homes
for families to buy or rent," said Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), the
leader of the Senate Banking Committee, which helped craft the
provision. "If we want to address the costs that are weighing families
down, we have to tackle the shortage of quality, affordable homes." But
those ideas long ago fell out of the discussions on Capitol Hill,
frustrating many Democrats, who have come to acknowledge their final
bill may offer only limited relief for families --- no free
prekindergarten, no rebates for child care, no aid for elder care, no
paid family and medical leave. While DeLauro, Brown and others pledged
to continue pushing, party leaders broadly have resigned themselves to
securing whatever deal they can with Manchin. "I think there's great
support still for some of the key elements of the package, especially
some of the elements that reduce costs for consumers," said Sen. Chris
Van Hollen (D-Md.), a top lawmaker on the chamber's appropriations
panel. But Van Hollen acknowledged that Congress and the economy are
"not where we were months ago, and getting something important now is
better than getting nothing." Fed chair acknowledges that higher
interest rates could cause a recession Democrats do still believe they
can secure prescription drug pricing revisions, empowering the
government to negotiate some costs on behalf of Medicare beneficiaries.
Wyden, who helped craft the provision, said that alone would help
seniors who are "getting clobbered at the pharmacy counter just as
they're getting clobbered at the gas station." An earlier version of the
proposal also would have saved the government about \$160 billion,
according to estimates at the time. But some other health-care
initiatives remain in doubt. That includes an existing federal program
that lowers insurance costs for millions of Americans who purchase
coverage through national health exchanges. These expanded subsidies
under the Affordable Care Act are set to expire at the end of the year.
Yet Democrats so far have not been able to strike a deal with Manchin to
preserve them, according to three people familiar with the matter who
spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the talks. The sources
cited Manchin's broader cost concerns as a key reason for the trouble,
especially since he has rejected past Democratic attempts to proffer
short-term extensions in a bid to save money. Manchin publicly has
expressed mixed views on the idea, at times citing the need to restrict
any benefits to lower-income Americans[. Without action, however,
roughly 13 million Americans could see higher premiums in
2023]{.underline}. The prospect prompted some Democrats this week to
redouble their calls for action, with House Majority Leader Steny H.
Hoyer (D-Md.) telling reporters on a call Thursday that the provision
"must be included" in any Senate deal. "Inflation is causing great shock
at the pump and in the grocery store," Hoyer added. "We must not let the
cost of health care go up as well when we have the power to stop that
from happening."

Economic recovery efforts since the 2008-2009 global financial crisis
have mainly depended on unconventional monetary policies. As fears rise
of yet another international financial crisis, [there are growing
concerns about]{.underline} the increased possibility of [large-scale
military conflict]{.underline}. More worryingly, **[in the current

Crisis responses limited [The 2008-2009 global financial crisis almost
'bankrupted' governments and caused systemic collaps]{.underline}e.
[Policymakers managed to pull the world economy from the brink, but soon
switched from counter-cyclical fiscal efforts to unconventional monetary
measures]{.underline}, primarily 'quantitative easing' and very low, if
not negative real interest rates. But while these [[monetary
interventions]{.underline}]{.mark} averted realization of the worst
fears at the time by turning the US economy around, they [[did little
to]{.underline} [address]{.underline}]{.mark} underlying [[economic
weaknesses]{.underline}]{.mark}, largely due to the ascendance of
finance in recent decades at the expense of the real economy. Since
then, despite promising to do so, policymakers have not seriously
pursued, let alone achieved, such needed reforms. Instead, ostensible
structural reformers have taken advantage of the crisis to pursue
largely irrelevant efforts to further 'casualize' labour markets. This
lack of structural reform has meant that [the]{.underline} unprecedented
[liquidity central banks injected into economies has not been
well]{.underline} [allocated to stimulate resurgence of the real
economy]{.underline}. From bust to bubble Instead, easy credit raised
asset prices to levels even higher than those prevailing before 2008. US
house prices are now 8% more than at the peak of the property bubble in
2006, while its price-to-earnings ratio in late 2018 was even higher
than in 2008 and in 1929, when the Wall Street Crash precipitated the
Great Depression. [[As monetary tightening checks asset price bubbles,
another economic crisis]{.underline}]{.mark} --- possibly more severe
than the last, as the economy has become less responsive to such blunt
monetary interventions --- [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} considered
[[likely]{.underline}]{.mark}. A decade of such unconventional monetary

### I/L -- Inflation 

#### U[nchecked inflation]{.underline}\-\--triggers a Deep recession

**Tully 11-3**-2021, citing William Luther, an economics professor at
Florida Atlantic University (Shawn, \"Th[e Fed has two options on
inflation---and **neither are pretty**]{.underline}\", *Fortune*,
<https://fortune.com/2021/11/03/fed-inflation-recession-forecast/>)

The two possible scenarios for inflation

[[The **longer** market]{.mark} participant[s]{.mark} [view]{.mark} the
[big numbers arriving]{.mark} month after month, [the **more they\'ll
lose faith**]{.mark} that the Fed\'s committed to doing what\'s
necessary to conquer inflation. The Fed could quell the outbreak now by
raising rates]{.underline} and otherwise modestly tightening its
monetary grip, notes William Luther, an economics professor at Florida
Atlantic University. But the central bank isn\'t moving. Although
Fed-watchers expect the central bank to hike rates twice next year,
those actions would simply mark the close of its super-stimulative
stance, maintained to counter the pandemic. So far, the Fed\'s shown no
intention of taking tough measures to slow jack rabbit prices.
\"Instead, all companies and consumers are witnessing is rising
inflation when the CPI reports each month, and the Fed saying nothing
about fighting it,\" says Luther. \"[If prices keep increasing at the
current clip, [producers will]{.mark} start **[bak]{.mark}**ing
[**expectations** of]{.mark} higher [inflation in]{.mark}to their wage
and procurement contracts]{.underline}.\" [Those **[locked-in
escalators]{.mark}** will [give the **hot streak
legs**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[If]{.mark} **strong [inflation]{.mark}** [takes
hold]{.mark},]{.underline} Luther predicts, [[the Fed will face **two
options**, **both bad**]{.mark} **for the economy**]{.underline} and
stocks. \"[[The]{.mark} first is that the [Fed]{.mark} \'sticks to its
guns\' by pledging to wrestle the price trend back to 2%, and because
it\'s waited so long, [must **radically contract**]{.mark}
**[credit]{.mark} to get there**]{.underline},\" say Luther.
[[That]{.underline}]{.mark} course [[would cause a **deep
recession**]{.underline}]{.mark}, pounding bonds and equities. [[In the
**second**]{.mark} course, [the Fed would]{.mark} simply
**[accept]{.mark}** and **perpetuate**]{.underline} the today\'s higher
[[inflation]{.underline}]{.mark} as a new normal. \"[The
market]{.underline} participants [would be expecting 3% inflation, and
the Fed would meet those expectations]{.underline} by delivering 3%
inflation,\" says Luther. The appeal of taking that path: It would avoid
an immediate recession. \"The first \'stick to your guns\' solution
would be require such a steep downturn because the Fed delayed getting
tough for so long,\" says Luther. \"It might take the second option
because the harder something is to do, the the less likely the Fed is to
do it.\" **[Punting carries a cost.]{.underline}** [The central bank
would be [**scrapping** its]{.mark} **longstanding**, [2% goal]{.mark},
and adopting a new stance of **tolerating high inflation**]{.underline}
to sidestep a recession. \"[That [would **greatly increase
uncertainty**]{.mark}]{.underline} for consumers, producers and
[[investors]{.underline}]{.mark},\" says Luther. \"[They**[\'d]{.mark}**
[worry]{.mark} that [the Fed is **no longer credible**]{.mark}, that
[it]{.mark} could [let inflation **get out of
control**]{.mark}]{.underline}.\"

#### Tolerating inflation [shatters]{.underline} growth

**Tully 11-3**-2021, citing William Luther, an economics professor at
Florida Atlantic University (Shawn, \"The Fed has two options on
inflation---and neither are pretty\", *Fortune*,
<https://fortune.com/2021/11/03/fed-inflation-recession-forecast/>)

Or, the Fed could take the low road and skirt the agony of a hard times.
But [**[embracing inflation]{.mark}** of 3%-or-higher [creates its
**own**]{.mark} **set of [problems]{.mark}**[. Suppliers would]{.mark}
**[avoid]{.mark} long-term [contracts]{.mark}** that provide their
clients certainty on their future input costs]{.underline}.
\"[[Those]{.mark} suppliers [would]{.mark}]{.underline} stand to
[[**lose money** if they committed to multi-year contracts]{.mark}, and
inflation raised their costs a lot more than they
anticipated]{.underline},\" says Luther. The bigger worry: [[America
would be]{.mark}come [a **far riskier place to do
business**]{.mark}]{.underline}, chiefly [because]{.underline}
consumers, companies and [[investors could no longer rely on the Fed to
keep **purchasing power** steady, a **pillar of our economic
might**]{.underline}.]{.mark} More uncertainty raises the \"equity risk
premium,\" the extra investors are willing to pay for stocks over
super-safe Treasuries. A rising ERP means lower multiples, and lower
equity prices. \"[[If the Fed **permits** higher
inflation]{.underline}]{.mark} to avoid recession, [we **know** that it
conducts policy not the way it promised]{.underline}, but the way it
sees fit at the moment,\" says Luther. [If the Fed\'s gone this far,
market participants will **fret**, [**who knows** if it will allow
inflation]{.mark} to **race [even faster]{.mark}?**]{.underline}

### Turns China 

#### Failure to prevent economic collapse guarantees US-China war

**Tkacik, 20** (Michael Tkacik, professor of government and director of
the School of Honors at Stephen F Austin State University in Texas,

for new great power war\",
<https://asiatimes.com/2020/04/ingredients-in-place-for-new-great-power-war/>)

[The [events leading to war in]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[1939]{.underline}** [included]{.underline}]{.mark} a sharp division
between the wealthy and everyone else, **[[economic
catastrophe]{.underline}]{.mark}** [in the **Great
Depression**]{.underline}, sharp reductions in global trade, a breakdown
in international cooperation, and the end of liberal governance in much
of the world. Once again, these variables are present.
[[Even]{.underline} **[before]{.underline}**]{.mark} the
**[[Covid]{.underline}]{.mark}**-19 pandemic, [**[trade]{.underline}**
[was]{.underline} **[decreasing]{.underline}**]{.mark} and
beggar-thy-neighbor economic policies had become the norm. It might be
tempting to place this blame on Trump, but he was elected by people in
his country who have suffered 40 years of criminal economic competition
from China. It is no wonder they elected Trump and it is no wonder he
undermined a global trade system that has failed America's working
class. Similarly, [evidence of the [breakdown of]{.mark} **international
[coop]{.mark}eration**]{.underline} [[and]{.underline}
**[liberalism]{.underline}** [are **everywhere**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
The world is unable to deal with the existential threat of climate
change. Authoritarian regimes have seats on the UN Human Rights Council.
There is a great and increasing gap between the wealthy and everyone
else, a new Gilded Age. Liberalism, unable to cope, is in retreat
everywhere, from the US and the UK to fledgling democracies in Eastern
Europe and Latin America. Our world is gravely ill. Pandemic [Into this
morass [we stir a **global pandemic**]{.mark}]{.underline}, with its
origin in a corrupt, authoritarian state that is hostile to openness,
human dignity and truth. That China denied and then exported the
pandemic was as predictable as it is lamentable. The pandemic will bring
[a]{.underline} [**[global]{.mark} economic [depression]{.mark}**[, the
**only variable from World War II not present
today**]{.mark}]{.underline}. We should expect more governments to fall,
we should expect liberalism to retreat further, and we should expect
increased nationalism and violence upon our own species. In short, we
are in for dark days. **[[Dictators]{.underline}]{.mark}** [attempt to
**[divert]{.mark}** the]{.underline}
**[[attention]{.underline}]{.mark}** [of their people
[from]{.mark}]{.underline} corruption and [[injustice by
seeking]{.underline} [**external enemies**. **Wars
will**]{.underline}]{.mark} **[therefore
[increase]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, [and]{.underline}]{.mark} status quo
powers such as [[the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**]{.mark}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[may]{.mark} attempt to]{.underline}
[**[defend]{.mark} a crumbling system**. [The chance
of]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[war between China and the
U]{.underline}**]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates has
**[[increase]{.underline}]{.mark}**d
**[[dramatically]{.underline}]{.mark}** because almost all of the
structural variables today point toward war. Both [[World War **I** and
**II**]{.underline}]{.mark} were avoidable because different variables
were present. Consequently, had skilled leadership been present, each
war might have been avoided by correctly diagnosing the causes of the
impending crises. That the wars were not avoided does not mean they
could not have been; it simply means leadership was not up to the task.
But today the causes of both of those wars [have been
**combined**]{.underline} [[in a **single
cauldron**]{.underline}]{.mark}. So it is reasonable to ask, [[even with
**good leadership**]{.underline}]{.mark} (of which there is no doubt we
are lacking), **[[can great-power war be avoided?]{.underline}]{.mark}**

### UQ -- House

#### **The GOP has an 87% chance of winning the House**

**Silver 6/30 --** Nate Silver is the founder and editor in chief of
FiveThirtyEight and the author of "The Signal and the Noise: Why So Many
Predictions Fail --- But Some Don't.", 6-30-2022, \"Why Republicans Are
Favored To Win The House, But Not The Senate,\" FiveThirtyEight,
https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-republicans-are-favored-to-win-the-house-but-not-the-senate/

[Republicans have an 87 percent chance of taking over the House,
according to the Deluxe version of our model. T]{.underline}hat's far
from certain, but [Democrats are fighting the odds: Their 13 percent
chances are equivalent to tossing a coin and having it come up tails
three times in a row.]{.underline} Ball-swarm (or bee-swarm) chart
showing which party wins control of the House in 100 sample outcomes
from our Deluxe model's 40,000 simulations, where Democrats have a 13
percent chance of winning the chamber and Republicans have a 87 percent
chance. That's not to say House control will be a matter of luck,
exactly. [A change in the political environment could have ripple
effects.]{.underline} For instance, sometimes one party wins nearly all
the toss-up races, as Republicans did in 2020. [However, even if
Democrats were to win all 13 races that our model currently designates
as "toss-ups" (meaning that no party has more than a 60 percent chance
of winning), plus hold on to all the seats in which they're favored,
they would still wind up with only 208 seats, 10 short of the number
they need for a majority. Instead, Democrats will also have to win some
seats where Republican candidates are currently favored, and that
requires the national political environment in November to be more
favorable for Democrats than our model is currently
expecting.]{.underline} On the one hand, the task isn't that daunting
for Democrats. Our model calculates that Democrats would be favored to
keep the House if they win the House popular vote --- or lose it by less
than 0.7 percentage points --- something that Democrats did in both 2018
and 2020. Moreover, Democrats are down by only about 2 points in our
current average of generic-ballot polls. Given the inherent error in
polling, and how much time there is between now and November, it isn't
hard to turn a 2-point deficit in the polls into a 1-point win. However,
in important ways, that 2-point deficit understates the degree of
trouble that Democrats are in. [One reason is because many of those
polls are conducted among registered voters rather than likely voters,
and the electorate that turns out in November is likely to be more
Republican than the broader universe of all registered voters.
Historically, the patterns in midterm elections are that: 1) Republicans
turn out more than Democrats, and 2) voters for whichever party doesn't
control the presidency are more enthusiastic and turn out
more]{.underline}. In 2018, those factors canceled one another out.
Democrats, not controlling the presidency, were the more enthusiastic
party, helping to neutralize the Republicans' historical turnout
advantage. [This year, though, they both work in the favor of
Republicans.]{.underline} Thus, the model adjusts those registered-voter
polls based on its estimate of what likely-voter polls would show, and
when it does that, the Republicans' generic-ballot lead is really more
like 4 points than 2 points. I should note that this adjustment is not
rigid in the model. Although the model uses historical turnout patterns
as its baseline assumption, it will override that based on polls. In
other words, if polls come out showing Democrats holding their own among
likely voters --- such as because of increased Democratic enthusiasm in
the wake of Roe being overturned --- the model will adjust to reflect
that. Put another way, a very strong turnout would give Democrats a
fighting chance of keeping the House. But also, the generic ballot isn't
the only input that the model considers, and some of the other factors
look worse for Democrats than the generic ballot does. [Based on the
historical tendency for the president's party to lose seats in the
midterms and Biden's poor approval rating, for instance, the situation
is more likely to get worse for Democrats than better.]{.underline} The
model also evaluates factors such as polling and fundraising data in
individual races. Overall, the Deluxe forecast expects Democrats to
eventually lose the popular vote for the House by closer to 6 points,
about the margin that they lost it by in 2014. And [it expects
Republicans to wind up with 237 seats in an average outcome, a gain of
24 seats from the 213 they had at the start of the current
Congress.]{.underline}2 Histogram of each party's seat count in
scenarios where it wins the House in our Deluxe model's 40,000
simulations, where Republicans have an 80 percent chance of holding
between 215 and 259 seats. [As I mentioned, this analysis is based on
the Deluxe version of our model, which accounts for polling,
"fundamentals" --- or factors such as fundraising and incumbency --- and
expert race ratings such as those put out by the Cook Political Report.
The Classic version of our model, which leaves out the expert ratings
--- sacrificing the additional accuracy they add but sticking to purely
quantitative factors --- tells a similar story, with Democrats also
having a 12 percent chance of keeping the House. The Lite version of our
model, meanwhile, which tries to forecast as much as it can based on
polls alone, does paint a more optimistic picture for Democrats, giving
them a 22 percent chance of keeping the House]{.underline}. But that
version leaves out a lot of useful information, especially given that
there isn't much polling in a number of competitive House races.

#### Republicans regain support to win despite current tensions

still **[the [Republican
Party](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/republican-party) who is expected
to come out on top in November.]{.underline}**

Historically, the party controlling the White House is the one that
loses the most seats in the first midterm election of its
administration, a fact that doesn\'t bode well for President [Joe
Biden](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/joe-biden).

[With [rising inflation](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/inflation),
record-breaking [gas
prices](https://www.newsweek.com/federal-gas-tax-holiday-isnt-relief-americans-truly-need-opinion-1721989) and [Biden\'s

has been]{.underline}** long **[predicted that
the [Democrats](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/democrats) will
see]{.underline}** particularly **[heavy losses this
year]{.underline}**, **[raising the potential of them losing majority
power of both the House and
the [Senate](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/senate) to the
GOP.]{.underline}**

However, there have been significant developments just in the past few
weeks which may drastically alter how people vote, including
the [ongoing January 6 hearings surrounding Donald
Trump](https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-jan6-cassidy-hutchinson-testimony-capitol-1720510),
and the [Supreme
Court](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/supreme-court) vote to
overturn *Roe v. Wade*, triggering abortion bans and severe restriction
in several states across the country.

With several weeks still to go before the polls open, a number of
[experts have suggested what the realistic best case scenario for the
GOP is]{.underline}, given the current political and economic climate.

Sean [Freeder]{.underline}, an assistant professor of political science
at the University of North Florida, [suggested that out of more than 450
congressional elections, only around six to 10 Senate races and 30-40
congressional House seats are competitive.]{.underline}

While **[Freeder expects the GOP to easily regain control of the
House]{.underline}**, [it may be more difficult for the party to take
the Senate]{.underline} because of what he calls \"a slate of weak
Republican candidates\" such as [Mehmet
Oz](https://www.newsweek.com/equality-deleted-mehmet-ozs-juneteenth-post-truth-social-1717218) in
Pennsylvania, [Herschel Walker in
Georgia](https://www.newsweek.com/herschel-walker-says-there-are-52-us-states-while-slamming-stacey-abrams-1718306),
and hopefuls in Arizona and Wisconsin.

\"It will ultimately come down to framing by each party. Democrats want
this election to be a referendum on Trump and the Dobbs
decision. [Republicans](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/republicans) want
this election to be a referendum on Biden and the economy,\" Freeder
told *Newsweek*.

\"[Best case scenario]{.underline} for Republicans: [Young and/or
leftist voters, disillusioned, stay home, and independents focus on
inflation and the concern of a looming recession]{.underline}.
Republicans sweep the winnable Senate seats, giving them 54-46 control
of the Senate, and a 40 seat advantage in the House.

\"[It would then be virtually impossible for Democrats to then pass any
major legislation in the period prior to the 2024
election.\"]{.underline}

Dr. Bernard Tamas, associate professor of political science at Valdosta
State University, also suggested that the best case scenario for
Republicans would be winning around 50 seats in the House, but only gain
around four or five seats in the Senate.

\"Flipping 10 seats in the Senate seems out of rea ch, which means that
the Republicans are unlikely to gain a [filibuster
proof](https://www.newsweek.com/manchin-sinema-critics-say-gop-will-end-filibuster-anyway-ban-abortion-1721215) majority,\"
Tamas told* Newsweek.*

\"Since the Republicans tend to vote as a bloc (much more than
Democrats), and since having a total of 60 seats in the Senate seems
unlikely, there might not be that much difference between the
Republicans doing either moderately well or extremely well against the
Democrats.\"

However, **[Tamas suggested it may still be too difficult to predict how
the overturning of Roe V. Wade will influence voters by the time of the
midterms]{.underline}**, despite polls suggesting a [majority of
Americans disagree with the
decision.](https://www.newsweek.com/supreme-court-overturning-roe-met-67-disapproval-among-women-poll-1719267)

\"[This is]{.underline} partially [because we haven\'t faced a
situation]{.underline} quite [like this before]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} partially [because]{.underline} [we don\'t know what
the abortion-related politics will look like in November]{.underline},\"
he said.

\"Midterm elections are heavily influenced by turnout. Anger drives up
turnout, and Republicans were the angrier group up until the Dobbs
decision was announced.\"

Dawn Teele, associate professor of political science at Johns Hopkins
University\'s SNF Agora Institute, believes \"big symbolic wins\" for
people who have expressed [anti-abortion views in the wake of *Roe W.
Wade*](https://www.newsweek.com/roe-wade-abortion-gop-midterms-democrats-1719910)---such
as Gov Greg Abbot in Texas, Walker in Georgia, and J.D Vance in Ohio,
all of whom have been endorsed by Trump---would be considered a success
for the GOP.

However, David [Niven]{.underline}, a political science professor at the
University of Cincinnati**[, believed that the best case scenario for
the Republicans is a \"triumph of mundane frustrations]{.underline}**\"
in which people decide to vote for issues other than abortion.

\"Inflation. Gas prices. Concerns about the strength of the economy. [If
voters make up their minds at the kitchen table while they\'re paying
bills, **Republicans could [sweep back into control of the
House](https://www.newsweek.com/just-how-much-trouble-are-democrats-these-polls-give-you-clue-1721692) and
the Senate---and maintain their advantage in governor\'s
races**]{.underline},\" Niven said.

President Joe Biden and congressional Democrats have checked some
big-ticket items off their list before the first half of his term is
over. First, there was the \$1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill,
followed by a bipartisan infrastructure bill, and a narrow gun safety
bill that nevertheless was supported by Republicans and represented the
biggest change to gun laws in 20 years. They confirmed the first Black
woman to the Supreme Court, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson[. But when it
comes to the 2022 midterm elections in November, it\'s what the party

incredibly difficult during the last two years of Biden\'s term. The GOP

& democracy reform: Biden and congressional Democrats placed passing
voting rights legislation as a top agenda item in response to a
years-long erosion of the Voting Rights Act at the hands of the Supreme
Court, new restrictions tightening voting rights in
Republican-controlled states, and President Donald Trump\'s brazen
efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss. But Democratic leaders\'
soaring rhetoric came careening against the math of the 50-50 Senate and
the reality of the filibuster. [Neither of the bills that Senate
Democrats proposed, a sweeping voting rights and campaign finance reform
bill and legislation to refortify the VRA, garnered firm support from
Republicans.]{.underline} Most GOP senators decried the measures as a
federal takeover of elections and a Democratic power grab and
filibustered voting rights legislation four times in 2021 and 2022.
Biden expressed his frustration with the bills stalling out in a January
2022 speech in which he blasted the Senate as a \"shell of its former
self,\" saying the filibuster has been \"weaponized\" and \"abused.\"
\"I\'ve been having these quiet conversations with members of Congress
for two months,\" Biden said. \"I\'m tired of being quiet!\" After that
speech, in which Biden endorsed filibuster reform to pass voting rights
legislation, Schumer deployed the last-ditch tactic of calling for a
vote on changing the Senate\'s filibuster rules via the \"nuclear
option,\" under which a simple majority of senators can vote to change
the chamber\'s filibuster rules, in January 2022 But two Democrats ---
Sen. Krysten Sinema of Arizona and Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia ---
have been steadfast in their opposition to scrapping or modifying the
filibuster rules, arguing that lowering the threshold to pass Democratic
priorities would come back to bite their party when Republicans retake
power and exacerbate partisan divisions in the chamber. The two
Democrats joined all 50 Senate Republicans in shooting down Schumer\'s
proposal to change the filibuster rules, striking the final nail in the
coffin for Democrats\' voting rights push. Since then, Manchin and GOP
Sen. Susan Collins of Maine have been **[leading a bipartisan group of

August recess]{.underline}**. [Any legislation they do propose would
fall far short of the voting rights protections Democrats

Police reform: The May 2020 murder of George Floyd and police-inflicted
killings of other Black Americans, including Daunte Wright and Breonna
Taylor, sparked massive protests around the globe and reinvigorated a
push to enhance accountability and overhaul standards for law
enforcement at the federal level and in many states and cities. After
taking office, Biden directed Congress to deliver a police reform bill
to his desk by May 25, 2021, the one-year anniversary of Floyd\'s
murder. In June 2020 and again in March 2021, the House passed [**the
George Floyd Justice in Policing Act**,]{.underline} a wide-ranging bill
sponsored by Democratic Rep. Barbara Lee that would ban chokeholds and
no-knock warrants for federal drug cases, require all federal law
enforcement officers to wear body cameras, end qualified immunity,
impose more federal oversight of police departments, and restrict access
to military-grade equipment. Democratic Sen. Cory Booker and Republican
Sen. Tim Scott took point on leading bipartisan negotiations to work out
a version of the legislation that could earn 60 votes in the Senate. But
**[talks officially broke down in September 2021 \"after months of
exhausting every possible pathway to a bipartisan deal]{.underline}**,\"
and securing the backing of major law enforcement unions, Booker said.
The negotiations fell apart when the parties deadlocked over how far to
rein in qualified immunity, the controversial legal doctrine that
shields law enforcement officials from personal liability for actions
they take on the job, including the use of force, that don\'t violate
\"established law.\" \"Unfortunately, even with this law enforcement
support and further compromises we offered, there was still too wide a
gulf with our negotiating partners and we faced significant obstacles to
securing a bipartisan deal,\" Booker said. Chances of priority passing

Washington, Wednesday, June 15, 2022. Scott J. Applewhite/AP Enshrining
abortion rights nationally: On June 24, the Supreme Court overturned Roe
v. Wade, a move that made abortion illegal in some states. [Most
congressional Democrats are in favor of a national abortion rights
law]{.underline}, and have voted in favor of the Women\'s Health
Protection Act. **[The bill would make abortion legal in every state and
undo most restrictions. It is similar to the abortion rights set out
under the now-defunct Roe, though it also allows abortions after
viability for undefined \"health reasons.\" For that reason, Republicans
have called it \"extreme\" and refused to support the
legislation]{.underline}**. It [passed the House but has already failed
twice in the Senate this year]{.underline}. Eleven more senators would
be needed to pass the legislation under the 60-vote threshold. Manchin
opposes the legislation, saying it goes beyond Roe. That\'s why Biden
calling for a filibuster carve-out on June 30 is unlikely to be
effective. Manchin and Sinema remain staunchly opposed to abolishing the
filibuster for any reason. Even without the filibuster, Democrats lack
the 50 votes they would need to pass their bill. GOP Sens. Lisa
Murkowski of Alaska and Collins both support abortion rights but say
Democrats\' bill has gone too far because it doesn\'t create moral or
religious exemptions. Collins is working on a bipartisan abortion rights
bill with Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, but one senior Democratic Senate
aide told Insider that Democratic women senators and abortion rights
groups say privately that they don\'t see the legislation going anywhere
because nine Republicans would need to get onboard, \"which everyone
knows will never happen right now.\" Democrats have stressed that they
want to put Republicans on the spot over the issue to draw a contrast
between the parties ahead of the November midterms. [Only remote
possibilities exist for enshrining abortion rights
nationally]{.underline}. One would be for some Republicans to cross over
on the filibuster and on the abortion rights bill. Another would be for
Democrats and Republicans to compromise on which measures they\'re
willing to support. One former leader in the reproductive rights
movement told Insider that even a limited bill, such as guaranteeing
access to abortion in the first trimester, would help 90% of patients
seeking to terminate pregnancies. In such a scenario, states would be
allowed to raise the gestation floor if they choose. But both sides
remain staunchly divided on the issue, meaning that without a
supermajority in the Senate or the abolishment of the filibuster, it
could remain in limbo with a patchwork of rules from state to state for
years to come. Chances of priority passing before the midterms: 0/5 Job

The Democratic record on the economy is a mixed one. The party\'s
enormous legislative ambitions to overhaul the American economy and
diminish worsening inequality have been undermined by their needle-thin
majorities in both chambers of Congress. Biden campaigned on restoring
the economy after it sharply contracted at the onset of the pandemic
with mass business closures and a drop in discretionary spending. Taking
office, he instilled a sense of urgency as he sought to avoid the kind
of drawn-out recovery that plagued past economic crises in the US.
\"There is real pain overwhelming the real economy,\" Biden said as he
introduced a COVID-19 rescue plan in January 2021. \"The very health of
our nation is at stake.\" During Biden\'s time in office, Americans have
poured back into the labor market and unemployment has fallen to lows
last seen in the late 1960s. In 2021, the economy grew at its fastest
pace since the Reagan years. Some of that progress can be attributed to
the \$1.9 trillion stimulus law, which provided financial relief to
Americans along with state and municipal governments. It also set aside
money for vaccine distribution that helped states and cities ease
pandemic restrictions. The law passed with unanimous GOP opposition.
However, **[the stimulus also partly caused another problem that
blindsided Biden administration officials. Inflation is now at its
highest level since the 1980s, largely the product of Americans with
plenty of cash to spend facing supply-chain bottlenecks]{.underline}**.
Democrats made limited legislative headway on what they intended to do.
Biden secured a \$1 trillion infrastructure law with some GOP support,
locking in a victory that eluded past Republican and Democratic
presidents. It contained \$550 billion in new funding to repair roads
and bridges, airports, ports and waterways. Other parts of Biden\'s
economic agenda --- including climate initiatives to reduce greenhouse
gas emissions and encourage the production of electric vehicles ---
remain an open question. Joe Manchin speaks with Kyrsten Sinema Sen. Joe
Manchin speaks with Sen. Kyrsten Sinema Jacquelyn Martin/AP Photo The
infrastructure law was originally tied to the passage of a larger social
spending and climate bill. Binding the priorities together was intended
to keep the small but potent centrist faction in line with progressives.
But when Republicans lined up against the larger bill, Democratic
leadership decided to settle for the smaller infrastructure-only
package, which Biden signed into law in November**[. Efforts to advance
immigration reform have also floundered]{.underline}**. Some Democrats
initially viewed setting up a pathway to citizenship for unauthorized
immigrants as a way to finance their spending ambitions, arguing it
would provide an economic boost. But it was knocked out of the social
bill by a Senate official and separate talks with Republicans haven\'t
yielded a breakthrough. Manchin and Sinema both wielded immense
influence over the Democratic agenda in the past year. That allowed them
to shrink the size and scope of the original safety-net bill since
Democrats couldn\'t afford to lose their votes in the 50-50 Senate.
**[The House-approved \"Build Back Better\" legislation died after
Manchin torpedoed it in December. D]{.underline}**emocrats are poised to
take another shot at passing a slimmer energy, climate and tax bill this
month. But it won\'t include many of the initiatives that Biden pressed
for, such as establishing a monthly child tax credit for parents,
universal pre-K, tuition-free community college, and expanding
affordable housing. Senate Democrats face a serious time-crunch to
approve the bill and send it to Biden\'s desk before the start of the
August recess. But they\'ve blown past deadlines before. Democrats have
until Sept. 30 to pass it with many elements outstanding as lawmakers
begin focusing on campaigning. Chances of priority passing before the

promise to expand the Affordable Care Act, more colloquially known as
Obamacare, so that more people living in the US could buy health
insurance. Biden and the Democratic-controlled Congress did deliver on
that to a small extent. The 2021 American Rescue Plan Biden signed into
law poured billions of federal dollars into the private health insurance
market. Doing so allowed buyers to get health insurance at a lower price
than before the stimulus law, sometimes even at no --- or very little
--- cost to themselves. But Democrats appear to have largely backed off
Biden\'s promise to create a \"public option\" for health insurance.
Such a system would give people the option to buy a health plan similar
to Medicare, rather than going to private insurers. As for the
subsidies, they are limited and set to run out at the end of the year.
That means that in the weeks leading up to the election Democrats will
face a barrage of stories about soaring health insurance costs. An
estimated 13 million people are expected to be affected, according to
the Department of Health and Human Services. Once again, Manchin holds
the cards. In June, he signaled to Insider he was open to expanding the
Obamacare subsidies but wanted to workshop them so they wouldn\'t go to
wealthy people. Under current law, some people receive more generous
subsidies than others depending on their income. People with
middle-class incomes and higher pay no more than 8.5% of their annual
income on health insurance they buy through the Obamacare marketplaces,
with the federal government picking up the rest of the tab. Democrats
may be able to extend the subsidies or make them permanent alongside
their economic policy proposals. Health insurers are pressing lawmakers
to get it done, and Democratic leaders have said it\'s a priority.
Manchin has been noncommittal. Democrats also are in talks about a bill
that would allow the federal government to negotiate the prices of some
prescription medicines. Doing so would help pay for the health insurance
subsidies. But pharmaceutical companies have been generous to Democrats
during recent election cycles and will oppose any attempt to curb their
profits. Plus the prescriptions proposal would need to get the agreement
of the Senate parliamentarian, Elizabeth MacDonough, to ensure that it
fits the rules of reconciliation. If it doesn\'t, then whether Senators
accept it or not becomes moot.

#### No chance of dem's winning -- razor thin margins, empirical midterms loss, and approval ratings are in the trash

Alison **Durkee 22**, 6-14-2022, \"Democrats' Midterm Nightmare: Polls
Suggest Party Could Face Historic Loss,\" Forbes,
https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2022/06/14/democrats-midterm-nightmare-polls-suggest-party-could-face-historic-loss/?sh=720fb2c15193

The Gallup poll, conducted May 2-22 among 1,007 U.S. adults, found [only
41% approve of]{.underline} President Joe [Biden's job performance, 18%
approve of Congress' performance and 16% are "satisfied with the way
things are going]{.underline} in the U.S." Only 14% have a positive view
of economic conditions right now and 46% rate the economy negatively,
meaning Americans have a 32-point net negative view of the economy.
**[All of those metrics are at least 10 points below the average for
midterm years,]{.underline}** based on Gallup's polling **[going back to
1974.]{.underline}** Americans have a 51% approval rating for the
president on average during midterm election years, a 30% congressional
approval rating, 35% satisfaction with the state of the U.S. and a
nine-point net positive rating of the economy. Other than presidential
approval rating---where Biden's 41% approval is tied with former
President Donald Trump's in 2018 and higher than President George W.
Bush's 38% in 2006---**[every metric recorded this year marks a historic
low]{.underline}**. Gallup suggests the low ratings mean **[Democrats
will likely lose seats in the election this year---as a president's
party typically does during the midterms---and their losses would likely
be even larger than usual if these low ratings hold]{.underline}**. BIG
NUMBER 23. That's the average number of House seats a president's party
loses during the midterms, Gallup found based on data going back to
1974. Parties suffer even bigger losses when Americans aren't satisfied
with how things are going, though: Republicans lost 40 seats in 2018
when Americans had a 21% positive view of Congress and 41% approval of
Trump, for instance, and Democrats lost 63 seats in 2010 during Barack
Obama's presidency. Though Obama was slightly more popular than Biden
(45% approval), Americans similarly had a 21% approval of Congress, 22%
satisfaction with the U.S. and 31-point net-negative view of the economy
that year. WHAT TO WATCH FOR How Democrats will fare in the midterms.
Republicans only need to flip five House seats to gain control of the
chamber, and one seat in the Senate, where the parties are now evenly
split. Based on current trends, Gallup projects the midterms will
potentially be a "wave election" for the GOP and give them a
"comfortable governing majority." WHAT WE DON'T KNOW How things could
change before November for Democrats. The Supreme Court is poised to
likely overturn Roe v. Wade and let states ban abortion in the coming
weeks, for instance, which recent polling has suggested may help
galvanize Democrats and get more to the polls. Gun control could also
come into play in the wake of a string of mass shootings, Gallup notes,
as polling shows most Americans favor stricter gun measures and thus
could be motivated to vote against Republicans who oppose them. KEY
BACKGROUND Gallup's polling comes as Biden has seen record-low approval
ratings in recent months, with a FiveThirtyEight analysis finding 39.7%
approve of him on average---the lowest share at any point during his
presidency. The president has not had an average approval rating over
50% since August 2021. Other polls have similarly found Republicans are
likely to have a clear advantage in the midterms, with a FiveThirtyEight
poll analysis finding 45% of Americans prefer to vote for a Republican
candidate in November versus a Democrat (42.6% would support the
Democrat). A Morning Consult/Politico poll from May found Republicans
were still more enthusiastic about voting in the midterms than Democrats
(61% versus 54%), even after Politico leaked a draft opinion suggesting
the Supreme Court will overturn Roe v. Wade.

#### Republican's win inevitable BUT no impact to the DA because dems can win next election

**Gallup. 22**, 6-14-2022, \"Usual Midterm Indicators Very Unfavorable
for Democrats,\" Gallup,
https://news.gallup.com/poll/393626/usual-midterm-indicators-unfavorable-democrats.aspx

WASHINGTON, D.C. \-- With less than five months to go before voters
elect all members of the House of Representatives and one-third of the
Senate, the **[current Democratic congressional majority is facing an
extremely unfavorable election environment]{.underline}**. The **[party
of the president typically loses U.S. House seats in midterm elections
\-- an average of 23 since 1974]{.underline}**. However, 2022 is not
shaping up to be an average year. Rather, as of May, Gallup finds
[presidential job approval and three other key national mood indicators
well below the historical averages measured in past midterm election
years]{.underline}. On their own, those numbers would all predict a
greater-than-average loss of seats for the Democratic Party this fall.
Gallup\'s latest data, from a May 2-22 survey, finds 41% of Americans
approving of the job President Joe Biden is doing, 18% approving of the
job Congress is doing, 16% satisfied with the way things are going in
the U.S., and a 32-percentage-point deficit in positive (14%) versus
negative (46%) ratings of current economic conditions. Each of those
metrics is at least 10 points lower than the historical average at the
time of past midterm elections, and most are on pace to be the worst of
such readings. The following sections of this report discuss how each of
these four polling indicators, as well as party affiliation, has related
to midterm election outcomes historically. President Biden Job Approval
Rating Midterm elections are widely seen as a referendum on the
incumbent president, and this is justified by the high correspondence
between overall job approval and seat loss for the president\'s party.
Given this, [congressional seat losses for unpopular presidents\'
parties have been above average historically, averaging 37 since
1946]{.underline}. [Biden\'s current 41% approval rating puts him in the
lower tier of all prior presidents\' job approval ratings taken just
before past midterm elections.]{.underline} Biden currently has the same
approval rating that Donald Trump did at the time of the 2018 elections,
when the GOP lost 40 House seats, and similar to Ronald Reagan\'s 42% in
October 1982, before the Republicans lost 26 seats. Only one president,
George W. Bush, had a lower rating than Biden does today, and his 38%
rating in November 2006 was associated with a 30-seat loss. Biden\'s
fellow Democrats Bill Clinton and Barack Obama lost an even larger
number of House seats in 1994 and 2010, respectively, with slightly
higher approval ratings than Biden has now. Those steeper losses reflect
the relatively large number of House seats held by Democrats going into
those elections in addition to the president\'s unpopularity. The
Democratic Party lost fewer seats in Obama\'s second midterm in 2014
when Obama was no more popular than in his first midterm four years
earlier, but Democrats were defending fewer seats. In the few elections
where the president\'s party has gained seats (1998 and 2002) or lost a
small number of seats (1986 and 1990), the incumbent president has been
broadly popular, with approval ratings well above 50%. The exception was
1974, with Gerald Ford\'s 54% job approval more reflective of his
honeymoon period in the months after he took office following Richard
Nixon\'s resignation in August of that year. The GOP\'s 43-seat loss was
likely tied to Nixon\'s unpopularity (24% approval in his last rating)
stemming from the Watergate scandal that led to his resignation. [While
Biden\'s job approval rating could improve by November, putting his
party in a less precarious position, he would be bucking the trend for
second-year presidents]{.underline}. Historically, presidents\' job
approval ratings have rarely improved in the last few months before
their first midterms. Democrats currently hold 220 seats in the House,
just two above the number needed for a majority, and far fewer than the
250-plus they held before the Republican wave elections of 1994 and
2010. This relatively low seat exposure could help to check Democratic
losses, as occurred in 2014. Congressional Job Approval Rating The 18%
of Americans who approve of the job Congress is doing would be the
lowest Gallup has measured in a midterm election if it holds at that
level through the fall. However, it would not be much lower than the 20%
to 21% approval ratings for Congress at the time of the past three
midterm elections. Americans\' view of the job Congress is doing is also
broadly predictive of how the president\'s party \-- if not also the
majority party in Congress \-- will perform in the midterms. In 1994,
2010 and 2018 \-- all years when Congress\' approval rating was between
21% and 23% and the president\'s party was in the majority \-- the
incumbent party lost between 40 and 63 House seats. In 2014, even with
approval of Congress at 20%, the Democratic Party lost only 13 seats \--
again explained by Democrats\' weak starting position that year when
House Republicans were in the majority. In years when congressional
approval was significantly higher, the president\'s party suffered
minimal losses or even gained seats. U.S. Satisfaction Americans\'
satisfaction with the way things are going in the U.S. is also on pace
to be the worst it has been in a midterm election year. The 16%
currently satisfied is six points lower than the prior midterm low \--
22% in 2010. Satisfaction relates to midterm House seat loss in a
similar way as the job approval variables, with greater losses tending
to happen in elections when satisfaction is low \-- such as in 1982
(24%), 1994 (30%) and 2010 (22%) \-- and more minimal losses or gains
for the president\'s party in years when satisfaction is high, including
1986 (58%), 1998 (60%) and 2002 (48%). Ratings of the Economy Gallup has
a shorter history of measuring Americans\' perceptions of current U.S.
economic conditions, dating back to the early 1990s. Since that time,
Americans\' views of the economy during midterm election years have only
ever been similarly bad as now once before \-- in 2010, when net ratings
of economic conditions were -31. Economic ratings tend to be less
strongly related to midterm election outcomes than other mood indicators
are, though views of the economy certainly influence how Americans rate
the job that political leaders are doing and whether they are satisfied
with the way things are going in the country. Positive evaluations of
the economy in 2006 and 2018 were not enough to overcome weak job
approval ratings for Presidents Bush and Trump, respectively, and for
Congress, suggesting political leaders were being evaluated on factors
besides the economy. But even if the economy is less correlated with
midterm election outcomes, the fact that Americans view it negatively
this year is just one more issue that does not reflect favorably on the
governing Democratic Party. Party Affiliation Vote choices in elections
are strongly tied to a voter\'s political leanings. Party affiliation
has been a good indicator of midterm election outcomes in the past
because it either related to the partisanship of the electorate or was a
harbinger of how people would vote. On average over the past three
months, Americans have been equally likely to identify politically as
Republicans or say they are independents who lean toward the Republican
Party (45%) as to identify as Democrats or to lean Democratic (45%).
While the parties appear, then, to be on equal footing heading into the
midterms, **[the figures are generally a better sign for the Republican
Party]{.underline}** than the Democratic Party for two key reasons:
First, historically, Democrats usually have an advantage on this measure
of party affiliation. For example, in 2021, Democrats had a three-point
advantage (though the numbers varied greatly over the course of the
year), which is typical. Second, Republican voters usually turn out at
higher rates than Democratic voters do. If usual turnout patterns hold,
and partisanship among all national adults is even, then the electorate
will have more Republican identifiers and leaners than Democratic ones.
There were also even splits in party affiliation in 1994, 2002, 2010,
2014 and 2018 election years, and all but one were good years for
Republican candidates. The major exception was 2018, a year in which the
parties were fairly evenly matched but Democrats did better in the
elections, perhaps because of Trump\'s unpopularity and the unusually
high turnout that year. By contrast, in years when the Democratic Party
had sizable advantages on party identification, like in 1998 and 2006,
Democrats picked up seats in Congress. Implications Americans\' dour
evaluations of the president, Congress, the economy and direction of the
country all suggest that the typical pattern by which the president\'s
party loses seats in midterm elections will hold this year. While
Republicans need to only pick up five seats in the House to take the
majority in that chamber (assuming the vacant seats formerly held by
Republicans stay with the party), the national mood is such that 2022
has the potential to be a wave election for the Republican Party and the
GOP could have a more comfortable governing majority. At the same time,
the relatively slim majority enjoyed by House Democrats should shield
the party from losses in the upper range of what\'s possible when
presidential approval is in the low 40s and less than a quarter of
Americans are satisfied with the state of the nation. While it is
unclear whether policy issues can eclipse presidential performance or
the national mood as midterm election voting factors, Democrats may
benefit politically from the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade and
Republican opposition to gun control measures in the wake of a series of
mass shootings. Recent Gallup data suggest abortion will be a more
important voting factor this year than it usually is in U.S. elections,
more so among those who support rather than oppose legalized abortion.
Also, even before the mass shootings, the majority of Americans
expressed dissatisfaction with U.S. gun laws and favored enacting
stricter laws. On the other hand, further increases in gas prices or
renewed focus on the border crisis could compound Democrats\' problems
in November. [Regardless of what issues might drive voter behavior,
unless Americans\' opinions of the job Biden is doing and the state of
the nation improve over the next five months, the Democratic Party may
face a situation similar to 1994 and 2010 when it suffered major losses
in its presidents\' first midterms but regrouped in time to win the
presidential election two years later.]{.underline}

#### Dem voter turn out low now and midterm cycle empirics means dems can't win \-- that's debate math

Joe Biden can thank record voter turnout, women, Black and Latino
Americans, young people and voters eager to get Donald Trump out of
office for the Democratic president\'s 2020 victory. Unfortunately for
Biden and his Democratic Party, **[the voters expected to turn out this
fall will be fewer, older, more likely to be white]{.underline}** --
[and eager to take out their frustrations on the party in
charge]{.underline}. Those historical voting patterns are a big reason
why [Democrats]{.underline} face such daunting challenges this fall as
they [struggle to hang onto razor-thin majorities in
Congress]{.underline}. And it has Democrats scrambling to find ways to
tweak the turnout machine in key states, where even a shift of a single
percentage point in a voter group could decide who controls the Senate
next year[. Not only are minority and young voters typically less likely
to vote in midterm elections, but the people who are inclined to turn
out are in a mood to punish]{.underline} -- and that means voting out
incumbents, says Matt Grossman, director of the Institute for Public
Policy and Social Research at Michigan State University. \"It\'s better
to say that you\'ve done something,\" if you are the party in power,
\"but you can\'t expect that to overwhelm the basic dynamic -- and that
is that people are more motivated by something that has happened that
they didn\'t like than that they did like,\" Grossman says. Record high
jobs creation? That\'s not resonating much with voters upset about
inflation that is at a 40-year high, experts say. Record numbers of
Black women being named to judicial posts by the Biden administration?
The voters who are thrilled by that development can\'t match the
motivation of parents convinced their K-12 children are being made to
feel guilty in the classroom for America\'s history of slavery and
racism. An anticipated Supreme Court opinion undoing guaranteed abortion
rights could well propel disaffected Democratic voters to the polls in
some areas of the country, making a pivotal difference in key races,
analysts say. With the governor poised to be the one-person roadblock to
abortion bans in several states, pro-abortion rights voters may be more
motivated to turn out, casting votes for Democrats up and down the
ballot. But [Democrats still suffer from basic math that disadvantages
the party in midterms]{.underline}. Voters 18-29 made up 17% of the 2020
electorate and voted heavily for Biden. In 2014, the last midterm where
a Democrat was president, young voters made up just 13% of the
electorate. In several states -- notably Wisconsin, Georgia and Arizona
-- small shifts could decide whether Biden will have a Democratic or
GOP-run Senate next year. But the peculiar natures of those states\'
electorates and candidates could make this fall far less predictable,
analysts and political operatives say. In Georgia, slight upticks in
turnout by women and Black voters helped Biden eke out a dramatic 2020
victory there and helped put Democrats Sen. Raphael Warnock and Sen. Jon
Ossoff over the top in 2021 runoffs, flipping control of the Senate to
Democrats. COMMERCE, GA - MARCH 26: Heisman Trophy winner and Republican

Senate, speaks during a rally in Commerce, Georgia, on March 26.(MEGAN
VARNER/GETTY IMAGES) If typical midterm trends stayed the same, Warnock
would likely lose to a Republican. But \"there are a couple of wild
cards in the mix here\" that make the race far more competitive, says
political science professor Alan Abramowitz, an expert on polling and
elections at Emory University. Black turnout -- which typically dips in
a midterm -- might be unusually higher because both Warnock and Stacey
Abrams, the Democratic nominee for governor, are Black. Abrams is also
widely credited with get-out-the-vote efforts that helped elect Biden,
Warnock and Ossoff. Secondly, Abramowitz says, incumbent Democrats could
have someone to run against, if Trump -- who was an early endorser of
GOP nominee Herschel Walker for the Senate -- makes himself very visible
in the campaign. \"The more prominent a role Trump plays in these
elections, the better it probably is for Democrats,\" who would be more
inspired to vote if their old nemesis is around, Abramowitz says. In
Arizona, Republicans are in great shape on paper, political experts say,
since GOP voters are much more likely to turn out in midterm elections.
Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly is defending his job, and the race for
governor in the Grand Canyon State is open. But again, the ghosts of the
2020 election -- and repeated lies that it was stolen from Trump --
could mix things up, says Chuck Coughlin, a longtime Arizona Republican
consultant. Trump was \"the greatest turnout machine that has ever
existed, at least in my lifetime here,\" Coughlin says. And several
leading GOP candidates this fall are continuing to push the falsity that
Biden did not legitimately win the election, which could bring those
Democrats back to the polls, he says. \"As we\'ve observed many times
out here, Republicans are being their own worst enemy. The focus on
election fraud is clearly not a general election winner in Arizona,\"
Coughlin says. Despite the numbers -- Coughlin predicts an 8-point GOP
turnout advantage in the midterms -- such talk by GOP candidates might
turn off independent voters critical to a general election win in
Arizona, he says. \"They are giving Democrats a giant opportunity to
prevail in the general,\" he says. In Wisconsin, Democrats have a rare
chance at a pickup as they seek to topple incumbent GOP Sen. Ron
Johnson. They also have a tough race in keeping Democratic Gov. Tony
Evers in office. A loss there would mean Republicans would have a
trifecta, control of both chambers of the state legislature and the
governorship. Biden won Wisconsin last year by a mere six-tenths of a
percentage point, so turnout among party loyalists could determine both
the Senate and gubernatorial races. And **[midterm cycle trends would
tend to give Republicans that tiny edge they need]{.underline}**. [Black
turnout]{.underline}, especially in the Democratic-heavy area around
Milwaukee, [tends to drop off in midterm cycles]{.underline}, [as does
the student vote]{.underline}, says David Canon, a political science
professor and expert on elections at the University of Wisconsin. One
\"wild card\" that could make a difference is if Lt. Gov. Mandela
Barnes, who is running in the Democratic primary for the Senate seat,
prevails, Canon says. Barnes is Black and from Milwaukee and might be
able to wrest a critical number of additional votes from those
residents, Canon says. \"Historically, Wisconsin has usually seen a
midterm election that is on balance more Republican than Democratic,\"
says Charles Franklin, director of the Marquette Law School poll. The
big exception, he says, was 2018, when an anti-Trump sentiment brought
out more Democrats. But with Trump not on the ballot in 2022, the 2018
blip in Democratic turnout is less likely to repeat, Franklin says.
Democrats believe they have a solid case against Johnson, who has
advocated repealing the Affordable Care Act (an issue that helped get
Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin win in an earlier race) and voted to
reject the slate of electors making Biden president. That could not only
motivate Democrats but alienate moderate Republicans, Democratic
operatives believe. The strategy will have to include finding ways to
reach a typical midterm audience, says a Democratic Wisconsin political
consultant. That means using older forms of communication -- such as
broadcast TV channels, instead of social media -- to connect with older
voters who don\'t get their information online, the consultant said. In
many of the pivotal races, big issues -- inflation, energy prices, the
outcome of the war in Ukraine and the prospects of the landmark Roe v.
Wade ruling legalizing abortion being overturned by the Supreme Court --
could motivate certain voter groups to show up at the polls. But **[for
Democrats, desperate to avoid a complete GOP takeover of Congress, math
is the enemy.]{.underline}**

### AT UQ--roe 

#### Economy swings voters to republicans -- overcomes roe 

E.J. **Dionne 22**, 6-15-2022, \"Opinion,\" Washington Post,

[Elections are decided by the issues on voters' minds, not the issues
many of us might wish were on voters' minds]{.underline}. This lesson
was brought home forcefully by the juxtaposition of the Federal
Reserve's big rate hike on Wednesday with the victory of Trumpist "big
lie" candidates in primaries the day before --- and the work of the
House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection. The Fed's
decision to raise interest rates by three-quarters of a point --- the
largest single increase since 1994 --- put [the economy smack in the
news cycle]{.underline} while **[underscoring how little control
President Biden has over what happens to costs between now and
November.]{.underline}** Meanwhile, the House committee investigating
Jan. 6 continued its effective work in calling attention to just how
off-the-charts dangerous and egregious Donald Trump's efforts to
overturn the 2020 election were. Its hearings have shown how close we
came to a democratic meltdown, how complicit --- often through their
silence --- many Republicans were with Trump's schemes, and how the
threat to our democracy is ongoing. Yet none of this could matter on
Election Day. If Republicans up and down the ballot win this fall
because so [many voters choose to punish Biden and the Democrats for
high prices]{.underline}, the GOP sweep would carry into office outright
election deniers as well as politicians too timid or too opportunistic
to challenge them. As Amy Gardner and Isaac Arnsdorf reported in The
Post, more than 100 GOP primary winners backed Trump's false claims of
election fraud. Tuesday's primaries underscored Trump's ongoing power to
defeat decent Republicans and bully others into submission. In South
Carolina, Rep. Tom Rice, one of 10 Republicans who voted to impeach
Trump, managed just one-quarter of the vote and was rebuked by a 2-to-1
margin. Rep. Nancy Mace, who was critical of the former president in
early 2021, defeated a Trump-backed candidate with 53 percent of the
vote. But she survived only by turning hard toward sycophancy, casting
herself as a longtime Trump loyalist. The most troubling result for
friends of democracy came in Nevada, where GOP voters nominated Jim
Marchant, a devout trumpeter of the former president's election
falsehoods, for secretary of state. Marchant has said he would not have
certified Biden's victory in the state. Inflation, of course, has
nothing to do with the secretary of state's job, but the trend toward
straight-ticket voting means that a revolt against Democrats at the top
of the ballot could put management of the 2024 elections in the hands of
the same sorts of people the Jan. 6 committee is exposing as dangerous
frauds. **[The potential for an economy-led GOP landslide is
high.]{.underline}** As Gallup's Jeffrey Jones and Lydia Saad reported
this week, data from a May 2-22 survey found [that only 41 percent of
Americans approve of the job Biden is doing]{.underline}, 18 percent
approve of the job Congress is doing, 16 percent are satisfied with the
way things are going in this country, and just 14 percent rate current
economic conditions positively. "[Voters tend to vote on the immediate,
particularly in midterms]{.underline}," said Jim Kessler, vice president
at the Third Way think tank. "**[Their long-term worries are
back-burner. And inflation is immediate."]{.underline}** This points to
several imperatives for not just Democrats but anyone who wants to
protect democracy. Especially in state and local races that affect
election administration --- think secretary-of-state positions and
governorships, particularly in swing states such as Wisconsin,
Pennsylvania and Michigan --- voters angry about the price of gas and
groceries must be persuaded not to let their rage translate into support
for Republicans who would throw sand into the gears of our democracy.
Much will depend on moderate independents and Republicans being willing
to put free elections first. Ben Wikler, the Democratic Party chair in
Wisconsin, also sees Trumpists' obsession with the "big lie" as a
potential opening for his party. "Republicans are so tied around the
axle of trying to relitigate the 2020 election," he told me, "that
they're leaving a lot of room for Democrats to demonstrate that we are
trying to bring down costs for people while they're concerned with
locking in their power." This points up the need for Democrats,
especially Biden, to try to cut their losses on inflation by arguing
their proposals to reduce costs are more credible than anything
Republicans are offering. It won't be an easy sell, but Biden took a
decent shot at this with a rousing speech to the AFL-CIO on Tuesday. But
there is no substitute for trying --- however hard it will be --- to
make the preservation of democracy a much higher priority for voters.
Their ballots won't cut prices at the pump or what they pay for
groceries. But they will determine the future of our experiment in
self-government.

### UQ -- ukraine thumps 

#### Ukraine thumps 

Radhika **Desai 22,** 5-24-2022, \"Ukraine on the midterms: Biden\'s
nightmare,\" No Publication,
https://news.cgtn.com/news/2022-05-25/Ukraine-on-the-midterms-Biden-s-nightmare-1ak6F2TaSFq/index.html

U.S. President Joe [Biden]{.underline} must have hoped that his war
against Russia, albeit a proxy war, would unite the nation and help his
embattled Democratic party in the November midterm congressional
elections. After all, he had a slavish media willing to repeat
practically anything issued from Washington word-for-word and without
question. If any such hope was not already illusory given the deep
economic, social and political divisions plaguing his country to the
point of ungovernability, recent events are making it so. In recent
weeks, [57 Republican Representatives and 11 Republican senators opposed
the passage of President Biden\'s \$40 billion Ukraine assistance
bill]{.underline}, up from only three Representatives who voted against
the first Ukraine bill in March. To be sure, the senators and
representatives were too few to halt the passage of the bill, though
U.S. Republican Senator Rand Paul held passage up for a week with his
demand that a special inspector general be appointed to oversee how the
Ukraine military aid is spent[. No innocuous hiccup, this was a major
contributor to Biden\'s nightmare to come. Senator Paul\'s insistence on
oversight pointed to the deep corruption of U.S.-Ukraine
relations,]{.underline} to which Joe Biden\'s son Hunter Biden has made
a great contribution through his liaisons with various Ukrainian
politicians and oligarchs. Those liaisons are under renewed scrutiny
after the media put the lid on it for the 2020 elections. That, however,
is only the sensationalist tip of a very troubling iceberg. Essentially,
[President Biden\'s proxy war is not going according to plan. The plan
includes destroying the Russian economy through sanctions. However,
while it is proving resilient despite the]{.underline} **[most and most
vicious sanctions imposed on any country, the U.S.
economy]{.underline}**, still reeling from the pandemic crisis, is
suffering from inflation, led by politically sensitive food and fuel
prices, and supply shortages. The plan was to destroy the ruble by
freezing the Russian central bank assets and throwing Russia out of the
Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT)
payments information system. However, while Russia continues to export
oil, the weaponization of the dollar system has put its future in doubt.
And the plan was to pump Ukraine with so much weaponry that its NATO
trained troops would defeat the Russians. However, Russians have slowly
and methodically secured Donetsk and Luhansk and destroyed Ukraine\'s
fighting capacities and infrastructure, including fresh shipments of
weapons. They may yet achieve a neutral, or neutralized, Ukraine, the
last of their declared objectives. President Biden signs the Ukraine
Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act of 2022 in the Oval Office of the White
House, in Washington, May 9, 2022. /VCG In a mid-term election year[,
the Republicans would be foolish not to milk Biden\'s failures for all
their worth in funding, publicity, and votes]{.underline}. As inflation
reaches 40-year highs, Senator Paul, for instance, rattled off a series
of statistics about the magnitude of the aid to Ukraine: adding to the
billions the U.S. has given to Ukraine since 2014, Congress will have
authorized some \$60 billion in total spending to the country, with the
last \$40 billion making Kiev the largest annual U.S. aid recipient.
With dominant media propaganda sounding more shrill than convincing, in
April, 63 House Republicans voted against a bill supporting NATO,
because some of its provisions about strengthening democratic
institutions might be used against governments of member states, such as
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban\'s. Most recently, [Russia\'s
undeniable military gains have forced some of the most prominent voices
to oppose Biden\'s war]{.underline}. Former U.S. Secretary of State and
long-time diplomat Henry Kissinger argued that Russia had always been
and remains part of the stability of Europe and escalating tensions with
it could only be disastrous for that continent. Restraint and
compromise, including Ukraine accepting territorial losses, was better.
The normally hawkish New York Times, while repeating may illusions about
Ukrainian military advances, nevertheless argued that it was not in the
U.S. interest to \"plunge into an all-out war with Russia\" even if it
meant that Ukraine faced some \"hard decisions,\" a reference to
territorial concessions. Moreover, it added, \"popular support for a war
far from U.S. shores will not continue indefinitely. Inflation is a much
bigger issue for American voters than Ukraine, and the disruptions to
global food and energy markets are likely to intensify.\" Even before
things began to go sour for Biden\'s proxy war, his Democratic Party was
looking at a defeat in the mid-term elections. Unless he manages a
nearly magically deft U-turn on its proxy war, the defeat will become a
rout.

### UQ\-- Innovation bill thumps 

#### Innovation bill thumps 

Jeffrey **Mervis 22**, 2-10-22, \"House passes sweeping U.S. innovation
bill, teeing up talks with Senate,\" No Publication,
https://www.science.org/content/article/house-passes-sweeping-u-s-innovation-bill-teeing-talks-senate

Remember when your mother said you might choke if you crammed too much
food into your mouth? In the weeks to come, Democrats in the U.S.
Congress will find out whether that warning also applies to their
ability [to finalize sweeping legislation that promises to double the
budgets of the]{.underline} National Science Foundation [(NSF) and other
key research agencies, pour money into high-tech industry, curb "malign
foreign influence" on U.S. research]{.underline}, and root out sexual
harassment in academic science. The effort, designed to maintain the
country's technological edge over China, took a major step forward today
when the U.S. House of Representatives [passed the America COMPETES
Act]{.underline}. The 2900-page bill must now be reconciled with a
similar, comparably massive bill called the U.S. Innovation and
Competition Act (USICA) that the Senate passed in June 2021. But ironing
out the [differences will test the Democrats' razor-thin majorities
i]{.underline}n each body. Although USICA (S.1260) was approved by a
vote of 68 to 32, including 19 Republican senators, COMPETES (H.R. 4521)
was supported by just one Republican and passed the House on a 220 to
210 vote. (One Democrat said nay.) Although key House Republicans have
said they support many of the research-related elements in the bill,
they strongly objected to other provisions, including language on trade
and labor policy. **[Negotiating a compromise bill acceptable to enough
lawmakers--and President Joe Biden--to make it into law will be a
complex task touching on a wide range of issues]{.underline}**. They
include how to allocate new research funds, how to protect U.S. research
from foreign interference while also reshaping immigration rules to make
it easier for the United States to attract foreign-born technical
talent, and whether to take a more aggressive stance to combat climate
change. Both bills come with hefty price tags: \$250 billion for USICA
and \$350 billion for COMPETES. And both include provisions that
authorize the government to spend tens of billions of dollars on
research across several federal agencies. The numbers are mostly
aspirational; [Congress would still have to approve most of the spending
through its annual budget process]{.underline}. Higher education
lobbyists hope legislators won't repeat what happened in 2007 and 2010,
when Congress failed to deliver promised big hikes in research spending
that it had authorized. The increased investments include adding an NSF
technology directorate and doubling the agency's overall budget over 5
years. The Department of Energy's Office of Science and its national
laboratories would get a similarly large boost. And the Department of
Commerce would get \$7 billion to establish a network of new regional
innovation hubs. The nation's semiconductor industry would receive \$52
billion, with the bulk of the money used to increase manufacturing
capacity but some also going to microelectronics research facilities.
ADVERTISEMENT Both bills call for tightening oversight of research
collaborations with China and a handful of other countries deemed to
exert a "malign foreign influence" on federally funded research. For
example, both bills would prohibit scientists with federal grants from
participating in Chinese talent recruitment programs and require
universities to provide more information about any foreign gifts they
receive. The two bills also seek to stamp out sexual harassment on
college campuses, calling for a uniform policy on reporting allegations
and findings to federal funding agencies. But there are also important
differences between the two bills on research policy. For example, the
Senate wants NSF's new technology directorate to focus on 10 key
disciplines, such as artificial intelligence and quantum computing. In
contrast, the House bill asks NSF to combat climate change, reduce
economic and social inequality, and build a robust scientific workforce
along with advancing strategically important fields. "[The Senate bill
implies a trade-off between supporting key technologies to maintain our
competitive edge and improving the quality of life for all
Americans]{.underline}," says a Democratic staffer on the House science
committee, which crafted many of the research provisions in the COMPETES
bill. "But we think that technology is simply a means to an end, and
that you can do both things." [The House and Senate also have competing
visions of how to spread federal research dollars more equitably across
the country]{.underline}, including to institutions that enroll large
numbers of students from groups traditionally underrepresented in
science. The Senate bill requires that 20% of the money slated for NSF
and DOE be spent in the roughly two dozen states that receive the fewest
federal research dollars. In contrast, the House bill avoids any
mandatory set-asides, instead creating new programs that target
institutions in those have-not states. The COMPETES Act would also
change immigration policy to allow more foreign students to stay after
they earn advanced degrees in science and engineering at U.S.
universities. One provision would exempt them from the existing cap on
the number of applications for permanent residency status. The bill
would also create a new visa category for budding high-tech
entrepreneurs. Those measures are likely to be opposed by lawmakers who
want to shut off the flow of immigration, especially from China and
other countries seen as economic and military foes, and the Senate bill
contains no such changes. The House bill includes a raft of provisions
on climate change. For example, it would authorize a 2-year, \$8 billion
U.S. contribution to the United Nations's Green Climate Fund, aimed at
helping emerging economies respond to the climate crisis. It calls for
spending \$600 million annually through 2026 to help U.S. solar energy
companies become "less reliant on solar components made in China." And
it would give the Department of State additional funds for
climate-related foreign aid, and for developing a new 10-year strategy
to mitigate global climate change impacts. The House bill's sweeping
scope is its strength, says Representative Eddie Bernice Johnson
(D--TX), chair of the House science committee. "With this legislation,
we are making investments to build clean energy solutions, address the
climate crisis, reinforce our national security, enhance our
semiconductor manufacturing capabilities, and so much more," Johnson
said in kicking off debate on the House floor that ended this morning.
"In short, we are acting to address the critical needs identified by the
scientific community, industry, academia, and other stakeholders as what
they need most to succeed in the 21st century." But the science panel's
top Republican, Representative Frank Lucas (OK), thinks Democrats
overreached by ignoring the concerns of his colleagues. The COMPETES
bill "undoes more than a year of bipartisan work by the House Science
Committee to develop and pass comprehensive legislation to double
investment in basic research," Lucas said in floor debate. "\[House
Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D--CA)\] hijacked good bipartisan bills dealing
with U.S. competitiveness and countering the malign influence of China
to pass another Democratic wish list that will go nowhere in the
Senate." **[Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle say they hope to
negotiate a final bill by this spring. But with the November elections
looming, and both bodies busy with other issues, including the Senate
confirmation of a new Supreme Court justice, it's not clear whether they
can meet that goal.]{.underline}**

[Why Covid-19 feels --- mostly --- invisible in the midterm
campaigns]{.underline} Covid's decline as an overt political issue has
been precipitous[. In January, in the thick of the omicron wave, it was
one of the top answers in Gallup's poll asking Americans to name the
most important problem facing the country. But three months later, in
April, the share who still put the pandemic as the No. 1 issue had
dropped from 20 percent to 4 percent]{.underline}; it was trailing
Russia and fuel prices among people's concerns. Inflation and the state
of the economy in general have become the dominant issues for voters.
Those problems have their origins in the pandemic, but they are
complicated by other events like the war in Ukraine. [Over time, voters
typically have less tolerance for politicians blaming the same thing for
all the problems in the world]{.underline}, even if there is some truth
to it[. It's old news]{.underline}. So [candidates are responding to
that apathy in the 2022 campaign]{.underline}s. Democratic politicians,
in particular, tend to be very reactive to voters' attitudes, Malhotra
said, and [voters right now are done with Covid-19.]{.underline}

Meanwhile, the urgency of improving domestic capabilities in domestic
production of computer chips has been highlighted by ongoing
supply-chain disruptions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. One year
ago, U.S. officials were confident that the worst was over. But there is
still no indication this is happening: PBS recently reported that new
U.S. car sales plummeted by 21 percent in the second quarter over a year
ago owing to shortages of computer chips, which have also driven up
prices of new and used autos.¶ On several occasions this year, Biden has
singled out Intel for committing to build a fabricating plant in Ohio
that would develop state of the art chip-making technology. In January,
Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said the company would invest up to \$100
billion to build the world's largest chip-making complex if it could be
assured of receiving some federal support. But with the legislation now
up in the air, Intel has since indicated that it is considering delaying
its initial \$20 billion investment, which was slated to be launched
this month.¶ Amid these developments, [Biden has urged Congress to "Pass
the damn bill and send it to me."]{.underline} However, as David
Ignatius observes, Biden appears unwilling to "crack some heads" to get
the job done: ["You can't fix everything in our messed-up country. But
you can deliver on your promise to create good high-tech jobs in the
semiconductor industry and compete with China for the strategic high
ground." ¶]{.underline} [The impasse over the semiconductor legislation
is emblematic of a larger issue. Namely, Biden's legislative agenda has
sought to enact the most sweeping social programs]{.underline} since
LBJ's Great Society when Democrats control both house of Congress by the
narrowest of margins. One would hope that Biden and progressive
Democrats would have learned by now that the way to produce tangible
results is to narrow the focus of bills they consider. ¶ Indeed, the
major economic accomplishment of the Biden administration was the
recasting of the infrastructure bill to gain bipartisan support. [Now it
has an opportunity to demonstrate how the federal government can play a
role in enhancing U.S. technology prowess by helping to develop state of
the art manufacturing capability.¶]{.underline} If this isn't clear to
progressive Democrats, [Biden]{.underline} should tell them [in no
uncertain terms]{.underline} that he [wants the America Competes Act to
be passed without further delay.]{.underline}

of the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade]{.underline} and
eliminating the constitutional right to an abortion. The executive order
attempts to [safeguard access to medication abortion and emergency
contraception, protect patient privacy, launch public education efforts
as well as bolster the security of and the legal options available to
those seeking and providing abortion services]{.underline}. Abortion
rights demonstrators gather to protest against the Supreme Court\'s
decision in the Dobbs v. Jackson Women\'s Health case on June 24, 2022,
in Austin, Texas. Where state abortion bans stand amid legal challenges
"President Biden has made clear that the only way to secure a woman's
right to choose is for Congress to restore the protections of Roe as
federal law. Until then, [he has committed to doing everything in his
power]{.underline} to defend reproductive rights and protect access to
safe and legal abortion," the White House said in a statement on Friday.
There is no action the President can take to restore the nationwide
right to an abortion in the wake of the Supreme Court's ruling. Biden
has acknowledged publicly his options to expand abortion access remain
limited, and has [called on the American people to elect more members of
Congress in November's midterm elections who will support federal
legislation protecting abortion access]{.underline}. The White House has
dismissed several progressive ideas to protect abortion access,
including allowing abortion providers to work from federal property in
states where the procedure is banned. White House press secretary Karine
Jean-Pierre said using federal lands for abortion services would have
"dangerous ramifications." The White House has also reiterated the
President does not support expanding the Supreme Court, as many
progressives have pushed for. Here's what's in the executive order that
was signed Friday: The President is directing Health and Human Services
Secretary Xavier Becerra to submit a report to him within 30 days on the
actions his department is taking on the matter. The President is also
establishing an interagency task force on reproductive health care
access, which will include Attorney General Merrick Garland. HHS will
take action to expand access to emergency contraception and long-acting
reversible contraception like intrauterine devices, or IUDs, according
to the White House. The department is tasked with ensuring patients have
access to "the full rights and protections for emergency medical care
afforded under the law" and the President has directed Becerra to
consider updating guidance that clarifies physician responsibilities and
protections under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act. Garland
has also issued a statement saying states cannot ban Mifepristone -- a
medication used to end early pregnancy that has FDA approval. The
department will ramp up outreach and public education efforts on
abortion "to ensure that Americans have access to reliable and accurate
information about their rights and access to care." In preparation for
expected legal challenges ahead, the attorney general and the White
House counsel are convening private pro bono attorneys and organizations
to provide more legal representation to those lawfully seeking abortions
as well as those providing them. The executive order also focuses on
protecting patient privacy. The President is asking the chair of the
Federal Trade Commission to consider taking steps to protect consumer
privacy when seeking information about reproductive health care
services. Biden has also directed Becerra, in consultation with Garland
and the FTC, to consider options to address deceptive or fraudulent
practices and protect access to accurate information. The President is
directing HHS to consider additional actions to safeguard sensitive
information related to reproductive health care, including under the
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. Becerra has
directed the HHS Office for Civil Rights to issue new guidance related
to the HIPAA Privacy Rule to clarify that doctors and medical providers
are in most cases not required -- and in many instances not permitted --
to disclose the private information of patients, including to law
enforcement. The office will also issue a guide for consumers on how to
protect personal data on mobile apps. [The order also looks to ensure
the safety of those seeking as well as providing abortion care,
including by protecting mobile clinics that have been deployed to
provide care for out-of-state patients]{.underline}.

### AT L---Tech regs bipartisan

#### Regulations on tech have bipartisan support

Bradley **Tusk 22**, 6-10-2022, \"Big Tech regulation is bipartisan,\"
Tusk is a political strategist and writer. He is the founder and CEO of
Tusk Ventures, the first venture capital fund to work with and invest
solely in high-growth startups facing political and regulatory
challenges. Protocol,
https://www.protocol.com/policy/bipartisan-tech-regulation-tusk#toggle-gdpr

We live in a society where each party instinctively opposes the views of
the other. If Democrats say they like ice cream, Republicans say that
ice cream has secret microchips that spy for the Chinese. If Republicans
say they like apple pie, Democrats say the dessert is a symbol of
oppression and must be banned. Sadly, it sometimes does reach levels
almost this silly. But [there seems to be one issue defying political
gravity: tech regulation. From Congress to the Supreme Court, from
states to presidential candidates, from think tanks on the left to those
on the right, the stars have aligned far differently around regulating
Big Tech than they have for almost any other current issue]{.underline}.
For example, the U.S. Supreme Court recently issued a stay of a Texas
law that was designed to ban online platforms from restricting user
posts based on political views. The social media companies argued that
the Texas law violated their First Amendment rights to control the
content on their platforms. So you have what's meant to be a
pro-Republican position on the Texas law --- preventing platforms like
Twitter from banning people like Trump --- against what's normally a
Democratic position, protecting the First Amendment. But the outcome was
surprising. The majority who voted to pause the Texas law --- Chief
Justice John Roberts (appointed by George W. Bush) and Justices Stephen
Breyer (appointed by Bill Clinton), Sonia Sotomayor (appointed by Barack
Obama), Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett (both appointed by Donald
Trump) --- make an unusual set of allies. And on the other side, Justice
Elena Kagan (Obama), one of the most liberal members of the court, sided
with Justices Samuel Alito (W. Bush), Neil Gorsuch (Trump) and Clarence
Thomas (George H.W. Bush) to oppose the stay --- not the usual
coalition. But justices aren't beholden to voters, so maybe it's easier
for them to agree while everyone else still has to toe the party line.
Disproving that theory, though, only requires one glance at the American
Innovation and Choice Online Act in Congress. The bill prohibits
dominant media platforms, defined by their market cap and number of
users, from discriminating against other businesses that rely on their
services. So for example, Amazon wouldn't be able to make products from
outside vendors far less attractive or easy to find than their own
products. The legislation, led by prominent Democratic Sen. Amy
Kloubchar, passed out of the Senate Judiciary Committee in January with
a 16-6 vote, reflecting broad bipartisan support. Republican Sens. Chuck
Grassley, Lindsey Graham, Ted Cruz, Josh Hawley and John Kennedy all
supported it, with Grassley and Kennedy both serving as co-sponsors.
Passing anything in Congress is still akin to a miracle, but if one bill
has a shot of passing this year, it may be this one. The **[bipartisan
trend toward regulating]{.underline}** Big **[Tech]{.underline}** even
occurred during the 2020 presidential race, one of the ugliest races in
history. Trump and Biden didn't agree on much, but they did agree on one
issue: revoking Section 230. Sec. 230 is a federal law that protects
platforms like Facebook or Twitter from being sued for content posted by
its users. In my view, it is the single biggest contributor to making
the internet toxic. And that issue is so much of concern to both sides
that Trump publicly called out "the horrendous tech giants," and argued
for repealing Sec. 230 at a rally in Georgia. Biden then said the same
thing: "Sec. 230 should be revoked, immediately should be revoked,
No. 1. For Zuckerberg and other platforms. It should be revoked because
it is not merely an internet company. It is propagating falsehoods they
know to be false." Now, given Washington's ineptitude, Sec. 230 is of
course still alive and well. But in a world where most issues are
automatically doomed because one side's support immediately prevents the
other's, there's at least a chance something can get done. The same
holds true at the state level. California, a blue state if there ever
was one, approved the California Consumer Privacy Act in 2018, giving
consumers the ability to protect themselves and their data from big tech
companies. The CCPA, which went into effect in 2020, contains a broad
array of consumer protections, ranging from the right to opt out of a
business's sale of their personal information to the ability to request
that business delete their personal information. Which were the next
three states to follow along? Colorado and Virginia, both purple states,
and Utah, an extremely red state. The legislation in each state
effectively does the same thing, providing consumers with some ability
to protect their privacy and their data. If Big Tech regulation were a
strictly partisan issue, this never would have happened. Even think
tanks on the left and right are in unusual places. **[No one ever
confuses the Brookings Institution and the Heritage Foundation, but they
both agree strongly on regulating]{.underline}** Big
**[Tech]{.underline}**. Brookings supports the creation of a federal
agency to oversee Big Tech. The [Heritage Foundation has equated big
tech to totalitarianism, calling for aggressive reforms to constrain
tech's ability to reshape society. Unlike almost every other issue out
there --- guns, climate, immigration, education, health care, abortion
and so on --- regulating Big Tech appeals to elected officials, judges
and scholars on both sides of the aisle]{.underline}. Does this mean we
should now expect a torrent of bipartisan legislation that finally takes
on issues like privacy, antitrust and platform liability? No. We're
still talking about the government; you should always bet on failure and
incompetence. But if you wanted to find one issue that at least has a
shot in an impending divided government --- with a likely Republican-led
House and Senate and a Democratic-led White House --- regulating Big
Tech may be your best bet.

#### Voter's favor tech regulation -- means at most the plan turns the DA and at the least there is no link 

Lauren **Feiner 20**, 7-29-2020, "New poll shows voters favor tech
regulation, but rank it a low priority," CNBC,
https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/23/new-poll-shows-voters-favor-tech-regulation-but-rank-it-low-priority.html

[Voters favor tech regulation]{.underline} but are less supportive of
measures they perceive to hamper their favorite services, [according to
a poll conducted by Morning Consult]{.underline} and commissioned by
tech-funded advocacy group Chamber of Progress. The survey results come
Wednesday, just hours before the House Judiciary Committee is set to
debate a series of antitrust bills aimed at reining in the power of the
largest tech firms. The bills follow an investigation by the panel that
found that Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google hold monopoly power. The
Big Tech companies or industry groups they fund, including Chamber of
Progress, have publicly opposed the bills, saying they would
fundamentally alter services users have come to rely on. According to
the new poll, that's a scenario voters would oppose. [Overall, survey
respondents didn't rank tech regulation high on their list of concerns
for Congress.]{.underline} Of a list of priorities including the
economy, public health, climate change and infrastructure, [44% of
respondents ranked technology company regulations as last on the list of
what Congress should address]{.underline}. Prior to seeing specific
examples of how large tech platforms would have to change their
services, 53[% of respondents said they at least somewhat supported
Congress passing legislation to impose new regulations]{.underline} on
companies like Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google. But when given
specific examples of how the businesses might have to alter their
offerings under the bills, more respondents said they would oppose them.
For example, when presented with the possibility that Amazon could be
restricted from giving free shipping on some Amazon Prime products, just
15% said they would still support such legislation, 17% said it would
have no impact on their thinking, 9% said they didn't know or had no
opinion and 59% said it would make them at least somewhat more likely to
oppose the bill. Two of the bills introduced by a bipartisan group of
lawmakers earlier this month could have the greatest structural impact
on the tech platforms. The American Choice and Innovation Online Act
would prevent dominant platforms from favoring their own services over
competitors that use their marketplaces, while the Ending Platform
Monopolies Act would prohibit such platforms from owning business lines
that present a conflict of interest. That presents a clear threat to
companies like Amazon and Apple, which operate marketplaces on which
they also offer products. After being presented with other possible
implications of the bills, like Google being restricted from showing
Google Maps in its main search results or Apple being prevented from
pre-installing certain apps, 39% said they would still at least somewhat
support such legislation. Both Democrats and Republicans were more
likely to oppose the bills after being presented with the scenarios.
Morning Consult surveyed nearly 2,000 registered voters from Thursday to
Monday on a range of questions about tech regulation. It gave the margin
of error as plus or minus 2 percentage points. Of the group, 40%
identified as Democrats, 34% as Republicans and 26% as Independents.
Respondents skewed slightly older, with 36% ages 45 and older, and only
19% made over \$100,000 in annual income. Chamber of Progress identifies
itself as a center-left group

they have strayed from relying on science and data]{.underline}. This
has impeded further biotech innovation that could improve safety and
solve pressing societal problems. USDA has made some progress updating
and streamlining regulations, but data and experience show it needs to
move farther and faster. EPA and FDA have become obstacles to progress
and safety advances and urgently need to correct course. The Office of
Science and Technology Policy should work with the Office of Management
and Budget to ensure updates take place quickly. This will stimulate
innovations in agricultural biotechnology across multiple sectors of the
economy

Mark **Strauss 18**, 8-28-18, "A majority of Americans support using
biotechnology to grow human organs in animals for transplants," Pew
Research Center,
https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/08/20/a-majority-of-americans-support-using-biotechnology-to-grow-human-organs-in-animals-for-transplants/

# Almost **[six-in-ten Americans (57%) consider it an appropriate use of technology to genetically engineer animals]{.underline}** to [grow organs or tissues that could be used for humans needing a transplant, while 41% say this would be going too far, according to a new survey by Pew Research Center. The findings]{.underline} **[are part of a larger pattern that reveals Americans are more likely to support the bioengineering of animals if it benefits human]{.underline}** health. Demand for transplantable organs and tissues continues to grow in the United States. Last year saw the most organ transplants ever performed in the country. Organs were recovered from more than 10,000 donors -- an increase of more than 25% over the past 10 years. Health experts attribute this increase, in part, to breakthroughs in medical technology that have made it possible to recover organs that previously would have been unsuitable for transplants. But, [despite these advances, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reports that the gap between supply and demand remains wide. Researchers are hoping to close that gap through the development of new medical technologies.]{.underline} One such approach is 3D organ printing-- a process that uses "bio-ink" to print layers of cells that grow to form transplantable tissue. Another method under development uses genetic engineering to grow human organs and tissues in animals. There was a breakthrough with this technique earlier this year, when scientists used gene editing to create hybrid embryos containing both human and sheep cells. When the survey -- conducted April 23-May 6 -- asked the 41% of respondents who opposed this application of genetic engineering to explain, in their own words, the main reason behind their view, the objections included concerns about the use of animals in this way for human benefit (21% of those asked) and the potential risks for human health (16% of those asked). The responses included: "In manufacturing organs, the existence of these animals would be miserable ... I can't ethically say that I would agree with such a practice." "Factory farming already as an industry unethically treats animals. I imagine organ growing wouldn't treat the animals any differently." "When you mix human and non-human genetics I believe that will cause extreme problems down the road." "Even human-to-human organ transplants often reject, so I can only imagine the bad side effects that an animal-to-human transplant would cause.

WHAT LESSONS CAN BE drawn from the first year of the Trump
administration about the potential resilience of liberal democracy in
the United States? A key question going forward is whether the popular
revulsion against Trump will focus on his assaults on democracy---or
will spill over into even deeper distust of democratic politics and
government. How Trump's critics perform in defending democratic
institutions and dispelling this distrust will determine whether
post-Trump America brings an era of democratic renewal. [[Long
before]{.mark} the election of Donald [Trump]{.mark}, [democratic
institutions were]{.mark} in trouble and [vulnerable]{.mark} to attack.
For more than a decade, [there has been]{.mark} growing discontent and a
[**steady deterioration** of]{.mark} public [support for the U.S.
system]{.mark} of democratic governance. Political [**polarization**
and]{.mark} differing **[partisan perceptions]{.mark}** of government
[are]{.mark} the [main contributors]{.mark} to this trend]{.underline}.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell famously announced in 2010 that
his main legislative goal was to make Barack Obama a one-term president,
signaling that Republican obstruction and legislative gridlock would
hobble the Obama presidency. [[The electoral process has been weakened
by]{.mark} the influence of [**unregulated campaign spending**
and]{.mark} an increase in state-level [**voting restrictions**
and]{.mark} legislative **[gerrymandering]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The
result has been a weakening of public belief in the ability of the
courts, Congress, and the Constitution to be effective in checking and
resisting abuses of power by the executive, and a drop in the percentage
of people who agree that the United States fully or mostly lives up to
democratic standards. [[Trump has exacerbated]{.mark} and accelerated
the [degradation of]{.mark} liberal [democratic
institutions]{.mark}]{.underline}. By repeatedly lying and manipulating
factual reality, he has promoted the view that there is no objective
truth. By attacking and insulting opponents, he has degraded public
discussion of issues and politicized the institutions that are normally
seen as nonpartisan guardrails of democracy. The federal courts, the
media, law enforcement agencies, and the federal civil service have all
been attacked by the president as partisan when they have resisted his
agenda. The president's attack on the FBI in its ongoing Russia
investigation into potential collusion and obstruction of justice is a
case study of how Trump politicizes nonpartisan institutions and
undermines the rule of law. Trump's attacks have been aimed at altering
the public's perception of an agency previously held in high regard as
professional and nonpartisan. In response to these attacks, the
institutions of American democracy have demonstrated varying degrees of
resistance and potential for resilience. Those that have been most
resilient, like civil society, are strong and innately capable of
defense, while others, like the electoral process, have been weakened by
partisan manipulation and are unlikely to be resilient unless reformed.
The greatest resilience has been demonstrated by the strongest
institutions, civil society and state and local government, and the
greatest vulnerability by the weakest, the electoral process and norms
of presidential conduct. Several institutions vulnerable to presidential
attack, like the media, have shown significant levels of resistance,
while others with inherent institutional strengths, like Congress, have
exhibited little to none. What makes some liberal democratic
institutions strong and others weak? The history of American political
culture has shaped a broad and diverse civil society with a tradition of
political activism, often in opposition to government. Tocqueville
pointed out two centuries ago that Americans make up for their
skepticism about government with their commitment to civic engagement.
Political culture in the United States has created a system of state and
local government which serves to check and balance federal power,
sometimes constructively, as over the past year, and sometimes
destructively, as during the post-Reconstruction period and the civil
rights revolution. At the same time, American political culture has
created a weak electoral process, plagued by historical anomalies such
as the Electoral College, multiple state and local jurisdictions,
unregulated campaign funding, legislative gerrymandering, and state
restrictions on voting. Presidential norms are vulnerable because they
are not written into law and are no match for a president who overrides
them. Congress has been badly weakened by political polarization,
despite its express constitutional powers. [The most surprising
[resistance]{.mark} to presidential attack during the first year of the
Trump presidency [has come from **four institutions**]{.mark} with
significant political vulnerabilities that make them ready targets for
an anti-democratic president---the media, the federal judiciary, law
enforcement, and the federal civil service.]{.underline} [[The]{.mark}
mainstream [media]{.mark}, as noted, have done surprisingly well, and
**[could emerge stronger]{.mark}** for Trump's assaults. The federal
judiciary is vulnerable because the president is reshaping the courts by
exercising his power to appoint new judges, but **[parts of the
judiciary have been resistant]{.mark}** over the past year to the
administration's anti-pluralist agenda on immigration, minority rights,
and partisan gerrymandering. [Similar resistance]{.mark} to the
president's attack on the rule of law in seeking to end or control the
special counsel's investigation has come from [within]{.mark} the
Justice Department and **[the FBI]{.mark}**. [And]{.mark} the [federal
civil service]{.mark}, despite senior positions filled by political
appointees or left empty, generally [has **maintained**]{.mark} **its
[professionalism]{.mark}** and resisted the administration's effort to
denigrate its work]{.underline}. It is too soon to tell how the
institutions of American democracy will perform beyond the first year of
the Trump presidency. Flaws in these institutions predating the Trump
presidency have been exacerbated by Trump's attacks. But U.S. public
opinion continues to reflect strong opposition to concentrations of
authority in the presidency, and this should provide a basis for
continuing resistance. There is an opening for Democrats to mobilize
public support in defense of constitutional norms and the rule of law in
the 2018 congressional elections, and a surge of new Democratic
candidates and court-ordered cutbacks in gerrymandering make it possible
to bring about change. [The bottom line is that American **[democracy
has shown]{.mark} a [potential for resilience during Trump]{.mark}'s**
first year. When [compared with other backsliding democracies]{.mark}
where neo-authoritarian leaders---such as Orban [in Hungary]{.mark},
Kaczyński in [Poland]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} Erdoğan in
[Turkey]{.mark}---have destroyed the independence and functioning of
pluralist institutions, **[the situation in the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [is better.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

democracy to be "unlikely," while another 25% said they were unsure. In
addition, 60% of Democrats and 61% of Republicans believe America is
becoming a "less democratic country." Both political sides also believe
they were treated more fairly "in the past" than now -- 71% of
Republicans and 50% of Democrats agreed with that statement. A new poll
from Yahoo News/YouGov found that a majority of Republicans and
Democrats believe the United States will "cease to be a democracy in the
future." A new poll from Yahoo News/YouGov found that a majority of

Additionally, the poll found that [52% of Republicans, 50% of
independents and 46% of Democrats believe "there will be a civil war in
the United States in \[their\] lifetime."]{.underline} While there
appears to be bipartisan hopelessness for the future of America,
respondents were quick to blame the other side for the present
predicament. A plurality of Republicans --- 30% --- described Democrats
as "out of touch with reality," while 25% claimed they were a "threat to
America." Another 8% see the Democratic Party as "immoral" and 4% said
it was a "threat to me personally." The poll found that nearly half of
Republicans, Democrats and independents believe there will be a civil
war in the US in their lifetime. The poll found that nearly half of

Republican Party "out of touch with reality," 23% saying they are a
"threat to America," 7% claiming the GOP is "immoral" and 4% calling it
a "threat to me personally." The Yahoo News/YouGov survey also polled
voters on the ongoing hearings held by the House select committee
investigating the Jan. 6 Capitol riot --- and overall, Americans are not
impressed. Only 24% of respondents said they watched the initial
primetime session broadcast last week, while 27% said they followed news
coverage after the fact. A whopping 49% said they have not followed the
hearings at all. Just 24% of participants in the survey said they

In the past [[climate change]{.underline}]{.mark} has likely
[[threatened]{.mark} the [early H. sapiens by]{.mark} **long [periods
of]{.mark} drought or [ecological change]{.mark}**, typically driven by
the glacial cycles.]{.underline} Cooling periods have been associated
with population contractions and extinctions (Foley, 1994; Gamble et
al., 2004). [[Still, **given human survival through these cycles** they
have been **insufficient to cause**]{.mark} **species
[extinction]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline} Typical discussions of
[anthropogenic climate change focus on scenarios with a few °C of
warming]{.underline}, because such scenarios are high probability, they
are near-term and can be analyzed using current data and models. [Such
"normal" climate change]{.underline} (comparable to past temperature
change during the Holocene \[Marcott et al., 2013\]) [is expected to
affect food security but **not in a radical way**. [An increase in
**climate related extremes**]{.mark} such as floods, droughts, cyclones,
and wildfires can be expected but **[would do]{.mark} mainly [localized
damage]{.mark}**[.]{.mark} Reductions in agricultural productivity and
water scarcity]{.underline} are to be expected. Effects depend on the
vulnerability profile of different regions but [are overall
negative]{.underline} (Schmidhuber & Tubiello, 2007; IPCC, 2014). Still,
[[despite serious local problems]{.mark} the overall [situation]{.mark}
appears to [pose **no**]{.mark} **major [risk to]{.mark} the
[survival]{.mark} of the species**. **Large temperature increases** (4+
°C) would affect ecosystems]{.underline} at the same level as human
land-use changes, cause substantial increase in extinction of non-human
species, and [increase the probability of **large-scale tipping
points**]{.underline} (when a smooth change of parameters leads to an
abrupt qualitative change in behavior) [such as disintegrating ice
sheets, methane release]{.underline} from undersea deposits
(clathrates), [and long-term droughts]{.underline} in some areas that
act as reinforcing feedbacks for a changed climate and ecosystem. At
this point crop yields can be expected to drop on the order of 20% or
more (depending on crop and location), outdoor activity in the tropics
becomes \[difficult\] ~~impaired~~, and global food security becomes
less stable (IPCC, 2014). [While this could seriously stress human
societies or force a smaller population **it is again not per se an
extinction risk**.]{.underline} However, little is known about tail
risks corresponding to higher temperature increases; uncertainty about
climate sensitivity and future emissions is compounded by the
possibility of positive feedbacks producing significantly more warming.
Wagner and Weitzman (2016) argued, based on IPCC data, that depending on
emission scenario [there is a **3%**]{.underline} to 10% [risk of a
6+ °C increase.]{.underline} At this point large regions would be too
warm for unprotected humans to survive in, and beyond 11--12 °C warming
this would encompass most currently inhabited regions (King et al.,
2015; Sherwood & Huber, 2010). [While this does not ensure extinction,
the global population would have a constrained and vulnerable
habitat.]{.underline} An even [more extreme scenario would be causing a
runaway greenhouse effect sterilizing earth. However, this is unlikely
to be possible through adding greenhouse gases]{.underline} (Goldblatt &
Watson, 2012). Conversely, triggering [a snowball earth
state]{.underline} (where the surface is nearly entirely frozen and the
ice and snow maintains the low temperature by reflecting sunlight into
space effectively) [would require a 10% reduction in solar
input]{.underline}, or a more modest reduction plus drastically lower
CO2 levels (Yang, Peltier, & Hu, 2012). Although the biosphere is
expected to destabilize eventually (dooming any terrestrial species) the
[[**expected lifespan is on the order** of]{.mark} 1.6--[**2 billion
years**.]{.mark}]{.underline} The cause of extinction is thought to be
the increasing solar luminosity, making conditions too hot, combined
with CO2 levels becoming too low for photosynthesis, or water loss to
space (Franck, Bounama, & von Bloh, 2006; Wolf & Toon, 2015).

This helps move the film's plot along, but gets the logic behind nuclear
missile submarines backwards. [A first strike only works if the majority
of an adversary's nuclear arsenal can be destroyed because whatever
survives will be launched in retaliation. That's what makes missile
[submarines]{.mark} important, their function isn't to conduct first
strikes but to [survive]{.mark} them [by being]{.mark} at sea [where
they are]{.mark} [less easily targeted]{.mark} than fixed missile silos
on land. [This makes them "]{.mark}survivable [second strike" platforms
that guarantee]{.mark} [retaliation]{.mark} in response [to]{.mark} an
[attack]{.mark}, thereby [removing]{.mark} the [incentive to conduct a
"first strike]{.mark}."]{.underline} The Red October wasn't, as one
on-screen admiral laments, "built to start a war," but to more
effectively deter one. Unspoken in the concern of all the American
admirals and generals in the movie, is that the Red October wasn't a
threat to mutual nuclear deterrence between the United States and the
Soviet Union, it was a guarantor of it; what it really threatened was
the ability of the United States to survive a Soviet nuclear retaliation
and "win" a potential nuclear war. This is an understandable advantage
to seek, but one that actually raises the risk of the disaster trying to
be averted. [[The Cold War is]{.mark} often [described as a condition of
mutual deterrence]{.mark} between the United States and the Soviet Union
-- "M.A.D."]{.underline} -- but this was never quite the United States'
strategy, which sought to deter its rivals but avoid being deterred
itself if it could be helped. Now the United States, which already
enjoys an enormous nuclear advantage over China, is working to ensure it
has sufficient conventional advantage against it. For more than a decade
[[the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates has [sought new]{.mark} strategies
and [tech]{.mark}nologies [to defeat China's anti-access and area
denial]{.mark} [capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline} -- thousands of
long-range land attack and anti-ship missiles intended to keep U.S.
fleets and warplanes far away from its coasts. This [restriction on its
freedom of action is broadly unacceptable to the United States,
motivating research into a host of advanced weapons to respond to
China's missile arsenal]{.underline}. These include new long-range
missiles that had been banned under the Cold War-era INF Treaty that the
United States exited last year, a range of hypersonic missiles that can
travel at five times the speed of sound or more, and the U.S. Army's
Strategic Long Range Cannon, a super gun designed to fire
rocket-assisted artillery shells to ranges of at least 1,000 miles. From
the outside, the argument that China's efforts to thwart the United
States' ability to conduct attacks against China is sign of malign
intention might appear to be bad faith, or at least obtuse. The United
States contends that this situation would give China a free hand to take
advantage of partners and allies, and potentially seize the island of
Taiwan by force. If China's capabilities all work as planned, and at the
outset of a war against Taiwan it sinks a U.S. fleet sent to deter it,
would China really expect that the United States would not retaliate,
and potentially with nuclear weapons? During the 1996 Taiwan Strait
crisis, a PLA general implicitly threatened that China might use its
nuclear deterrent to prevent the United States from coming to Taiwan's
aid, reportedly telling a senior U.S. official that Americans "care more
about Los Angeles than they do about Taiwan." But even if true[, [China
could not be]{.mark} [confident]{.mark} that [it could issue a nuclear
threat]{.mark} against the United States [without]{.mark} a
[response]{.mark}. [The question then isn't]{.mark} only [whether the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [cares more about its cities than]{.mark}
keeping [Taiwan]{.mark} free, [but]{.mark} simultaneously [whether China
cares]{.mark} [more about Shanghai]{.mark}, for example, [than]{.mark}
it does about seizing [Taiwan]{.mark}.]{.underline} For the architects
of the Trump administration's defense strategy, the [Pentagon's new
weapons programs are a way to fight a major war against China without
having to resort to using nuclear weapons. This is true as far as it
goes, that the United States needs a credible conventional deterrent
against Chinese aggression, but sidesteps how a war that would lead to
conventional strikes against targets on China]{.underline}'s mainland on
the one hand, [and against U.S.]{.underline} territories and allies [on
the other, doesn't rush precipitously towards nuclear use
anyway]{.underline}. And in trying to figure out how to fight a major
war against China without nuclear weapons, dismisses the idea that a
credible risk of that war going nuclear is a much surer deterrent
against it breaking out in the first place. [Since both the United
States and China have nuclear weapons]{.underline}, and especially in
light of China's efforts to improve the survivability of its nuclear
missile submarines[, a **major [armed conflict]{.mark} between the two
[should be deterred by]{.mark} the [threat of mutual nuclear]{.mark}
[attack]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The possibility of a non-nuclear
conflict between them rests on the logic of the stability-instability
paradox. This theory posits that [two nuclear-armed countries both
desire to avoid total destruction and therefore will avoid conflicts
that risk escalating to that level of force.]{.underline} But as a
result of that strategic-level stability, each feels secure in engaging
in lower-intensity conflict, confident that the other would not risk
nuclear escalation over comparatively minor provocations. This is likely
part of the reason that Chinese planes and ships, like the Soviets
before them, have felt secure to engage in "games of chicken" with U.S.
planes and ships resulting in incidents from the 2001 EP-3 collision in
which a Chinese pilot died to near-collisions between warships in 2013
and 2018. The Hunt for Red October also suggests, incorrectly (or at
least exaggeratedly), that dangerous incidents like these might lead to
cataclysm. In a scene where the National Security Advisor admonishes the
Soviet Ambassador, he warns that U.S. and Soviet warships and planes
operating close together was highly dangerous, and that "wars have begun
that way." It's a concern both the United States and China have invoked
about interactions between their navies when operating in the South
China Sea, on the theory that an unintended incident might spark an
armed clash and escalate from there. But as straightforward as the logic
seems, [the [worry that incidents]{.mark}]{.underline} like these [might
[lead to miscalc]{.mark}ulation [and escalation appears
unfounded]{.mark}, and historically, [wars haven't ever begun that
way]{.mark}.]{.underline} Still, [the [fear]{.mark} of unintended
escalation has [motivated]{.mark} some positive steps, such as a [series
of agreements]{.mark} between the Chinese and U.S. militaries [to define
safe behavior]{.mark} between their units,]{.underline} mirroring
similar Cold War agreements between the United States and the Soviet
Union. But China and Russia appear to have figured out a strategic
asymmetry that the United States still struggles with. At the low-end,
both China and (now) Russia still repeatedly violate those agreements,
variously in letter and spirit, recognizing that these
[incidents]{.underline}, dangerous as they are, [lack the potential for
escalation]{.underline} the United States often asserts they do,
[leaving it with mostly unsatisfactory responses.]{.underline} But at
the high-end, [the United States is working feverishly to figure out how
to fight major wars under the assumption that they would not go
nuclear,]{.underline} one that the implicated adversaries may not share.
If it is going to succeed in great power competition, the United States
has to figure out how to flip both scripts.

## AT ! -- Filibuster 

### Filibuster good

#### Eliminating the filibuster would allow a Republican takeover after midterms -- preservation is key to checking the GOP

**Thiessen 7/5** \[Marc A. Thiessen, Thiessen is a columnist focusing on
foreign and domestic policy. He writes a twice-weekly column for The
Post on foreign and domestic policy. He is a fellow at the American
Enterprise Institute, and the former chief speechwriter for President
George W. Bush. He is a Fox News contributor, "Weaken the filibuster
before a wave election? That would be a bad move, Democrats.",
Washington Post, June 5 2022,
https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/07/05/filibuster-roe-democrats-manchin-sinema/\]//RA

[Do Dem]{.underline}ocrat[s]{.underline} [never learn from their
mistakes?]{.underline}

In an act of stunning political and legislative incompetence, President
[Biden is calling on Senate Democrats to bypass the filibuster to pass
legislation codifying Roe v. Wade --- even though he knows]{.underline}
full well [he does not have the votes to make this happen.]{.underline}
Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin III (W.Va.) and Kyrsten Sinema (Ariz.)
don't support weakening the filibuster to codify Roe. Biden is raising
expectations among his base that he will almost certainly dash ---
further dispiriting them before the November midterm elections.

But [even if he did have the votes,]{.underline} **[it would be foolish
to weaken the filibuster just months before a wave election that is
expected to sweep Democrats out of power on Capitol Hill.]{.underline}**
[The president's party has lost]{.underline}, on average, [27 House
seats in midterm elections since 1946.]{.underline} And this will not be
an average midterm election. [Biden has been the most unpopular
president since the modern polling era began with Harry S.
Truman]{.underline}. **[Republicans are all but certain to win back the
majority in the House]{.underline}**, and need only a net gain of one
seat to take back the Senate.

It's possible that Democrats could somehow manage to hold off a GOP
Senate takeover in 2022, but the field is even more tilted toward
Republicans in 2024. Democrats will be defending 23 seats, while the GOP
will be defending just 10. None of those GOP seats are in states Biden
won in 2020 --- and only one, Florida Sen. Rick Scott's, is in a state
that Donald Trump won by less than five points. So [the odds are
overwhelming that if Republicans don't win back the Senate this year,
they will do so in 2024]{.underline}. And considering the unprecedented
serial disasters Biden has unleashed in his first term, **[Republicans
are more than likely to control the House, Senate and White House in
just over two years' time.]{.underline}**

Given that grim political reality, **[why on earth would Democrats want
to do anything to weaken the filibuster?]{.underline}** Let's say they
succeeded in using a filibuster carve-out to codify Roe. Two years from
now, Republicans could use that same carve-out to reverse the Democrats'
action and pass a national abortion ban in its place.

That would be just the beginning. [History shows that partial filibuster
carve-outs don't last.]{.underline} During the Obama administration,
then-Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) eliminated the
filibuster for all federal judicial appointments except Supreme Court
nominees. That set the precedent for Republicans to eliminate it for
Supreme Court justices as well when Trump came to power --- paving the
way for the 6-to-3 conservative majority that just overturned Roe.

**[If Democrats dilute the legislative filibuster]{.underline}** by
setting it aside when it comes to their key priorities**[, that will set
a precedent for Republicans to eliminate it]{.underline}** entirely
**[when they take over.]{.underline}** If Democrats like the string of
victories the Supreme Court's conservative majority handed down this
term, they will love what a Republican-controlled, filibuster-free
Senate will do.

[They should look back on]{.underline} all [the legislation they stopped
Republican majorities from enacting because of the
filibuster]{.underline} --- from entitlement reforms to lawsuit reforms,
election reforms, border-wall funding, an end to sanctuary cities and
restrictions on cash bail, the elimination of restrictions on oil and
gas exploration, national right-to-work legislation, expanded gun rights
and the defunding of Planned Parenthood --- and then imagine all that
and more being enacted by simple majority vote when Republicans regain
control of both Congress and the presidency. In the words of my Post
colleague Ruth Marcus, "Welcome to the apocalypse."

What is remarkable is that [despite these obvious
consequences]{.underline}, Senate [Dem]{.underline}ocrat[s]{.underline}
[would eliminate the legislative filibuster without hesitation were it
not for Manchin and Sinema]{.underline}. [They justify this]{.underline}
legislative vandalism [by arguing that]{.underline} Senate Minority
Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) [will eliminate the filibuster
anyway]{.underline} when Republicans take power, so they might as well
do it now while they have power. **[There is no evidence to suggest that
he would.]{.underline}** Quite the opposite, McConnell wisely refused to
scrap this rule at a time when Republicans controlled the White House,
Senate, and House of Representatives, despite President Trump's repeated
urging that he do so, because, McConnell said, ["There are no permanent
victories in politics."]{.underline}

[Biden once understood this]{.underline}. Back in 2005, when Democrats
were filibustering President George W. Bush's judicial nominees,
then-Sen. Biden took to the Senate floor to warn Republicans against
eliminating the filibuster to get them through. "You may own the field
right now, but you won't own it forever," Biden said. He'd do well to
remember those words, and take his own advice.

#### Maintaining the filibuster is integral to democrats' long term goals -- removal would be detrimental

his previous role as a national political correspondent, he was the
author of The Daily 202, The Post\'s flagship political newsletter; the

Washington Post, July 6 2022,
https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/07/06/busting-filibuster-abortion-crazy/\]//RA

[Dem]{.underline}ocrat[s]{.underline} [hoping to change the rules of the
Senate in a futile bid to pass a federal law protecting abortion rights
are displaying]{.underline} the most [myopic political
thinking]{.underline} since liberals called for defunding the police.

Then, as now, their anger was righteous and raw. Millions of Americans
took to the streets in the spring of 2020 to protest systemic racism
after the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis. But the shortsighted
demands to divert resources from law enforcement continue to hobble
Democrats who never even embraced the idea. **[Revising the filibuster
will hurt]{.underline}** even more in the **[long term.]{.underline}**

The left's thirst for Senate Democrats to do something about Dobbs is
understandable, but the reality is that **[weakening the filibuster
would]{.underline}** simply **[open the door for Republicans to pass
their own, far-more-punitive federal restrictions once they inevitably
return to power.]{.underline}**

Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) points to seven bills restricting abortion
rights that would have passed the Senate in recent years had it not been
for the 60-vote threshold necessary to overcome a filibuster. **[With
Roe gone, Sinema says the filibuster is "more important now than
ever."]{.underline}**

[Republican visions of an abortion-free America will turn]{.underline}
very [real if the Democrats pursue this goal]{.underline}. Just two
years ago, when Donald Trump was president, 53 senators voted to advance
a 20-week abortion ban and 56 senators backed a Born-Alive Abortion
Survivors Protection Act, which would have created criminal penalties
for doctors who failed to follow new federal standards after procedures
went awry. In 2015, 53 senators voted to ban federal funding for Planned
Parenthood. In 2006, 57 senators voted to make it a federal crime to
transport a minor across state lines to get an abortion without
notifying her parents in advance.

[Pretending Democrats can carve out a narrow filibuster "exception" that
Republicans won't exploit]{.underline} to their own ends [later requires
a]{.underline} willful [blindness to political reality]{.underline}.
**[Republicans would use an abortion exception to pass all sorts of
federal restrictions on abortion]{.underline}** as soon as they have the
votes.

Democrats should have learned this lesson by now. In 2013, then-Senate
Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) wrangled the votes to get rid of
the filibuster for most presidential nominations, but he insisted it
would not apply to the Supreme Court. That opened the door in 2017 for
his successor as majority leader, Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), to
remove the high court exemption so he could confirm Justice Neil M.
Gorsuch. If Reid had left the original 60-vote threshold in place for
all nominations, Justice Amy Coney Barrett --- who cast the deciding
vote to overturn Roe --- might not have been confirmed on the eve of the
2020 election.

"[The filibuster is going to protect the interests of
Dem]{.underline}ocrat[s]{.underline} in the future, as it has in the
past," said Ronald Weich, who was chief counsel to Reid and is now dean
of the University of Baltimore School of Law. "**[We'd live to regret
it. ... I don't know how you get the genie back in the
bottle."]{.underline}**

Besides, [Senate Democrats don't even have a majority ready to codify
the principles of Roe]{.underline}. A vote in May only mustered 49
votes. Nor should Democrats take any solace that two Republican women
currently in the Senate identify as pro-choice. Alaska's Lisa Murkowski
faces a tough reelection fight in November. Pro-lifers may not even need
the vote of Maine's Susan Collins.

[Biden]{.underline} surely [understands these dynamics]{.underline}, and
he's spoken eloquently in the past about the virtues of the filibuster.
So why did he announce his support for suspending the rules? It's the
same reason he backed "going nuclear" this year to expand voting rights,
which also fell short.

Grassroots Democratic activists are angry and talk to each other in a
deafening echo chamber called Blue Twitter. [The president is insecure
about his standing with his base]{.underline}. [He is worried liberal
voters will stay home this fall if he doesn't take steps to secure
reproductive freedom.]{.underline} And his aides know that abortion is
not an issue he has always been comfortable discussing.

Nonetheless, **[it would be madness for Democrats to roll back the
filibuster four months before midterm elections when the president's
approval rating is below 40 percent]{.underline}**, and the Senate is
split 50-50. Democrats only control the chamber because of the
tiebreaking vote of Vice President Harris.

Five years ago, when she was a freshman senator from California, Harris
joined 60 other senators in signing a letter that called for saving the
legislative filibuster. Back then, Trump was publicly berating GOP
leaders to change the rules to pass his agenda. But McConnell resisted
that pressure.

Now it's time for Biden, Harris and the current Democratic leader, Sen.
Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.), to do the same and reject demands from their
left.

#### Removing the filibuster would be short-sighted and disastrous for a democratic future 

**Geraghty 6/30** \[Jim Geraghty, Geraghty is the senior political
correspondent of National Review, "What Happens If Democrats Start
Creating Exceptions to the Filibuster?", National Review, June 30 2022,
https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/what-happens-if-democrats-start-creating-exceptions-to-the-filibuster/\]//RA

[President [Biden]{.underline} [said]{.underline} in Europe
today](https://www.nationalreview.com/news/biden-calls-for-filibuster-exception-to-codify-roe-after-outrageous-supreme-court-decision/)[ that]{.underline}
Senate [Democrats should eliminate the filibuster for abortion
legislation,]{.underline} as well as for his preferred election reform
legislation: "If the filibuster gets in the way, it's like voting
rights, it should be provided an exception for this...to the
filibuster."

In other words, the minority party in the Senate should be able to block
legislation with 41 votes, unless Joe Biden thinks the legislation is
really important.

At [the risk of echoing
Charlie](https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/joe-biden-wants-a-filibuster-carve-out-for-the-democratic-party/),
**[one of the hallmarks of this era is a stupefying lack of foresight in
our political leaders]{.underline}**, **[where they fail to foresee
the]{.underline}** most likely **[consequences of their
actions.]{.underline}** [If]{.underline} Senate [Democrats]{.underline}
vote to change the rules of the chamber, and [eliminate the
filibuster]{.underline} for one or two of their top priority issues[,
then when Republicans regain control of the chamber]{.underline} ---
which could be as soon as January! --- **[the GOP majority will vote to
eliminate the filibuster]{.underline}**, either on their own priority
issues or entirely. After all, why should Republicans keep this
provision to help the minority, when Democrats eliminated it to
disempower the GOP minority of 50 senators?

This is a repeat of when Harry Reid eliminated the filibuster for lower
court nominees... and then a few years later, Democrats were shocked
when a Republican majority eliminated the filibuster for Supreme Court
nominees.

[If you want a lasting national legislative change in the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, [you need to get some buy-in
from the opposition party]{.underline}. If Barack Obama enacts a nuclear
deal with Iran, and joins the Paris Accords by executive fiat, then
Donald Trump can undo those moves with the stroke of his pen. If Donald
Trump approves the Keystone Pipeline and border wall funding through
executive order, Joe Biden can repeal those decisions upon taking
office. If Congressional Democrats enact an Obamacare on a party-line
vote, a GOP Congress and president can repeal it on a party-line vote.

legislation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartisan_Safer_Communities_Act) --
because they all had some significant level of support from the
opposition party.

Presidents and Congressional majorities change from cycle to cycle; for
a long time, [America has had a pendulum effect]{.underline}. [One party
wins a big majority, starts to overreach, triggers a backlash, and the
opposition party racks up big gains in the next election]{.underline}.
Then once the opposition party has climbed back into control over the
White House and Congress, they start to overreach themselves, starting
the cycle all over again.

You could argue there's even a similar effect on the Supreme Court ---
turnover is slow and not on any set schedule, but it happens -- and any
decision enacted by one court, like *Roe v. Wade*, can be reversed by a
later court that looks at it again and concludes it is not consistent
with the U.S. Constitution. The more you want a change to be lasting,
the more you need all branches of government to formally sign off on the
change.

For some reason, a surprising number of **[shortsighted political
leaders keep making decisions with the assumption that their side will
be in charge of these institutions forever]{.underline}** -- **[and that
the opposition will never be in a position to reverse those
changes.]{.underline}**

**Walt 20** \[Stephen M. Walt is the Robert and Renée Belfer professor
of international relations at Harvard University. "Will a Global
Depression Trigger Another World War?", May 13^th^,
<https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/05/13/coronavirus-pandemic-depression-economy-world-war/>\]

On balance, however, [I do [not]{.mark} think that **[even]{.mark} the
[extraordinary economic conditions]{.mark} we are witnessing today are
going to have much [impact]{.mark} on the [likelihood of
war]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Why? First of all, [[if depressions were
a]{.mark} powerful [cause]{.mark} of war, **[there would be a]{.mark}
[lot more]{.mark}** of the latter.]{.underline} To take one example,
[**[the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates has [suffered 40]{.mark} or more
[recessions]{.mark}** since the country was founded, yet it has
[fought]{.mark} perhaps [20]{.mark} interstate [wars, most]{.mark} of
them [**unrelated** to the]{.mark} state of the
[economy]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} To paraphrase the economist Paul
Samuelson's famous quip about the stock market, [[if recessions were
a]{.mark} powerful [cause of war, **they would have predicted "nine out
of the last five**]{.mark}]{.underline} (or fewer)."

Second, [[states do not start wars unless they believe they will **win a
quick and**]{.mark} **relatively [cheap victory]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
As John Mearsheimer showed in his classic book Conventional Deterrence,
[national leaders avoid war when they are convinced it will be long,
bloody, costly, and uncertain. To choose war, political leaders have to
convince themselves they can either win a quick, cheap, and decisive
victory or achieve some limited objective at low cost]{.underline}.
Europe went to war in 1914 with each side believing it would win a rapid
and easy victory, and Nazi Germany developed the strategy of blitzkrieg
in order to subdue its foes as quickly and cheaply as possible. Iraq
attacked Iran in 1980 because Saddam believed the Islamic Republic was
in disarray and would be easy to defeat, and George W. Bush invaded Iraq
in 2003 convinced the war would be short, successful, and pay for
itself.

The fact that each of these leaders miscalculated badly does not alter
the main point: [**[No matter what a country's economic condition
might]{.mark} [be]{.mark}**, its [leaders will not go to war unless they
think they can do so]{.mark} quickly, cheaply, and [with a reasonable
probability of success]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

Third, and most important, [the **[primary motivation for]{.mark} most
[war]{.mark}s [is]{.mark} the [desire for security, not economic
gain.]{.mark}**]{.underline} For this reason, [the [odds of war increase
when states believe]{.mark} the long-term [balance of power]{.mark} may
be [shifting against them]{.mark}, when they are convinced that
adversaries are unalterably hostile and cannot be accommodated, and when
they are confident they can reverse the unfavorable trends and establish
a secure position if they act now]{.underline}. The historian A.J.P.
Taylor once observed that "every war between Great Powers \[between 1848
and 1918\] ... started as a preventive war, not as a war of conquest,"
and that remains true of most wars fought since then.

[The bottom line: [Economic conditions]{.mark}]{.underline} (i.e., a
depression) [may affect the broader political environment in which
decisions for war or peace are made, but **they [are only one factor
among many]{.mark} and [rarely the most
significant]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[Even]{.mark} if the COVID-19
pandemic has [large, lasting]{.mark}, and [negative effects on the world
economy]{.mark}---as seems quite likely---it is **[not likely to
affect]{.mark} the [probability of war]{.mark} very much,**]{.underline}
especially in the short term.

### no runaway inflation

#### No risk of runaway inflation

**La Monica 21** (Paul, digital correspondent for CNN Business. He
writes daily about the markets and blue chip companies. May 20. \"The
Fed needs to get real about inflation\"
<https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/20/investing/inflation-stocks-economy-federal-reserve/index.html>)\]

[But does the Fed risk losing Wall Street credibility if Powell
continues to put on blinders and stick his fingers in his ears whenever
someone mentions inflation]{.underline}? Not necessarily.

\"[How much inflation actually sticks]{.underline}?\" Foster wondered.
She noted that many [companies]{.underline} are [using more automation
and]{.underline} are [spending to boost productivity]{.underline}. That
[could be an \"antidote to runaway inflation]{.underline}.\"

Companies managing cost pressures for now

Even as top US companies like Walmart (WMT)boost their minimum wages,
which should be inflationary, there are other ways for businesses to
keep a lid on prices.

\"We\'ll navigate the supply chain challenges and inflationary
pressures, whether that\'s in cost of goods or wages,\" said Walmart CEO
Doug McMillon on an earnings call with investors this week. \"We\'ll
monitor our price gaps and adjust as appropriate.\"

Both McMillon and Walmart US president John Furner repeatedly referred
to \"levers\" that Walmart could pull to make sure the retailer won\'t
have to dramatically raise prices.

In other words, [major American companies are going to do what they can
to eat some of the rising labor and commodity costs instead of passing
them on to consumers]{.underline}.

One market expert also pointed out that [the hyper-focus on inflation
could be a good thing. Investors are often spooked by problems they
don\'t anticipate, the proverbial black swans. Inflation fears are
hardly that. At this point, inflation fears are about as common as cats
and dogs]{.underline}.

\"[It\'s great that everybody is talking about inflation. The market
can\'t really be shocked by it anymore]{.underline},\" said Linda
Duessel, senior equity strategist at Federated Hermes.

## poll stuff

### Five-thirty-eight polls good 

#### Five-thirty-eight polls good 

Nate **Silver 22**, 6-30-2022, Silver is the founder and editor in chief
of FiveThirtyEight.\"Why Republicans Are Favored To Win The House, But
Not The Senate,\" FiveThirtyEight,
https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-republicans-are-favored-to-win-the-house-but-not-the-senate/

Changes to the model Overall, we're **[happy with our congressional and
gubernatorial forecasts]{.underline}**, which last underwent a major
revision before the 2018 elections. They [performed very well in 2018
and fairly well in 2020]{.underline} (despite a challenging year for the
polls in 2020; it helped that our model also considers a number of other
factors in addition to the polling). Therefore, the overall methodology
is largely the same. However, after assessing the performance of the
models, we did make a few changes around the margins: In evaluating
fundraising for congressional candidates, [the model now places more
emphasis on contributions received within the candidate's
state.]{.underline} Fundraising is a highly nationalized activity these
days; Democrats in California and New York regularly contribute to
Senate campaigns like that of Democrat Jaime Harrison of South Carolina,
who raised a record amount of money in 2020 but nonetheless lost to
Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham by 10 percentage points. As such, our
analysis finds that a dollar received from within a candidate's state is
about five times as valuable as a dollar received outside of it in
predicting the eventual election outcome.5 That's why the model now
applies that ratio, multiplying any funds raised from voters within the
candidate's state by 5, when assessing which candidate has the
fundraising edge. [The model now puts more emphasis on basic
partisanship as opposed to other fundamentals]{.underline}. The
fundamentals component of our model, used in the Classic and Deluxe
versions, evaluates a series of variables such as fundraising,
incumbency, candidate experience, congressional voting records and even
scandals to make a forecast. The formula is fairly complicated, so we
tested a simple alternative in an era of high partisanship.
Specifically, [we looked at what would happen if you made a forecast
based solely on the partisan lean of a state or district, plus
generic-ballot results]{.underline}. For instance, if the generic ballot
favors Republicans by 4 percentage points, and a state leans Republican
by 3 points, you might expect the Republican to win there by 7 points.
In testing this on 2018 and 2020 races, we found that the more
complicated version of our fundamentals formula does outperform this
simple alternative. But it's pretty close, and a blend of the
complicated and simple formulas does better than either one taken
alone.6 What this means is **[that state partisanship and the generic
ballot will have more influence on our model going forward and the other
fundamentals factors less]{.underline}**, although they certainly matter
some. We assume errors are more correlated from race to race. In
presidential races, forecast and polling errors are highly correlated
from state to state. It wasn't a surprise that Trump won Wisconsin and
Pennsylvania in 2016 given that he also won Michigan, for example, since
the states are fairly similar demographically. (Accounting for this
properly was a big reason that FiveThirtyEight's model gave Trump a
better chance than others in 2016.) This also holds in congressional
races, though to a considerably lesser degree since there are different
candidates on the ballot in each state. A scandal affecting the
Republican candidate in Georgia won't necessarily have any impact in
Arizona, for instance. However, **[our analysis suggests that polling
errors are becoming more correlated in congressional races,
too]{.underline}**. Certainly, 2020 was a prominent example given that
Republicans won nearly every toss-up race for the House and that polls
for Congress had a strong overall bias toward Democrats. Therefore,
we've increased the degree to which race-by-race errors are assumed to
be correlated in the model.7 We've reduced the emphasis on sample size
when weighting polls. This is consistent with a change in our pollster
ratings methodology and is explained in more detail there. We've removed
a series of changes in the 2020 model that were specific to the COVID-19
pandemic. Yes, I know the pandemic isn't over yet, but voting will take
place under far more normal conditions than in 2020.
