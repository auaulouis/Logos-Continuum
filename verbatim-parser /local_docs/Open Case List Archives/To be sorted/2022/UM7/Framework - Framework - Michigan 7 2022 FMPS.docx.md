After months of amassing troops around Ukraine's borders,
[**Russia's** [**invasion**](https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/ukraine-crisis-ukraines-turbulent-history-since-independence-from-russia-in-1991-a-timeline-2786339)]{.underline} of
its neighbor [was **met with** frantic condemnation]{.underline} [from
world leaders and]{.underline} an outpouring of [**support on social**
media]{.underline}. [Russia]{.underline} [has]{.underline} long
[been]{.underline} [priming]{.underline} the [information environment
for this]{.underline} invasion, identifying and [exploiting]{.underline}
regional [grievances]{.underline} [in]{.underline} eastern and southern
[Ukraine]{.underline} since the country's independence in 1991,
[and]{.underline} [[more recently in fabricating
pretenses](https://medium.com/dfrlab/how-ten-false-flag-narratives-were-promoted-by-pro-kremlin-media-c67e786c6085) for
starting a war of its own making]{.underline}. While Russian narratives
continue to be [amplified by state
media](https://medium.com/dfrlab/russian-outlets-steadily-increased-claims-that-ukraine-will-start-a-war-144d60fe10b9),
as well as American politicians seizing the opportunity to attack
opponents at home, [Western **democracies** must not be sucked into
merely refuting Russian claims]{.underline}. They [**must shift**
**focus to**]{.underline} the **[disastrous consequences]{.underline}**
[of]{.underline} this [war]{.underline}. At the same time, they **[must
not lose sight of]{.underline}** other **[pressure]{.underline}
[points]{.underline}** [Russia has been pushing **in**]{.underline} its
**[digital sovereignty]{.underline}** efforts.

Russia hasn't exactly been subtle about its interests in Ukraine, whose
proximity and overlap in populations has encouraged local[ elites to
cooperate with their bigger
neighbor](https://www.amazon.com/Ukraine-Crisis-What-Means-West/dp/0300211597) in
the past. [Oligarchs]{.underline} have [frequently]{.underline}
[sided]{.underline} [with Russia]{.underline} [for]{.underline} their
own [financial gains]{.underline}, often [controlling [Ukrainian media
outlets](http://ukraine.mom-rsf.org/en/) to further]{.underline} their
[agendas]{.underline}. Russia has been adept at understanding regional
divisions in Ukraine, conducting extensive [surveys in the
east](https://rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/special-resources/plot-destroy-ukraine/) to
identify issues to exploit, such as existing political cleavages. This
has been made easier in part by the [close cultural
ties](https://www.crisisgroup.org/europe-central-asia/eastern-europe/ukraine/252-nobody-wants-us-alienated-civilians-eastern-ukraine) between
Russia and Ukraine's Donbas region.

One narrative pushed by Russian politicians since the collapse of the
Soviet Union has been particularly troubling: that parts of Ukraine are
Russian and need to be recovered. The widespread commentary from Russian
officials deepened fears of what Russia might "[take
back](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/near-abroad-9780190069513?cc=us&lang=en&)."
Indeed, Putin predicated his 2014 annexation of Crimea on the fact that
Russians made up the majority of the population there and needed to
be [protected from Ukrainian
oppression](https://www.brookings.edu/book/imperial-gamble/). In this
latest escalation, **[Russia]{.underline}** has [**sought to manufacture
justification for** **invading** **Ukraine**]{.underline},
[including [claims that Russians are facing
genocide](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/putins-absurd-genocide-claims-cannot-hide-his-war-crimes-in-ukraine/)]{.underline} [in
rebel-held areas]{.underline}. [Russia]{.underline} has also [[long
weighed
in](https://wcfia.harvard.edu/publications/everyone-loses-ukraine-crisis-and-ruinous-contest-post-soviet-eurasia) on
Ukrainian elections]{.underline}, making its desired outcome known.

The [tropes]{.underline} now being proffered [to justify a Russian
invasion]{.underline} of Ukraine [are old]{.underline}---one cannot
simply walk into an information ecosystem hoping to shape it. But
democracies face a new [question: What is to be done?]{.underline}

One possibility is that democracies seeking to respond to this crisis
could take a page from the Russian playbook. Russians seeking to
influence the information environment often rely on inundation and
repetition---a tactic frequently overlooked in the West, given that
media outlets prefer novel stories over repeated facts. However, nothing
is stopping Western officials from resurfacing key points. Much like
Russian officials and their supporters point out past American mistakes,
American officials could **[recycle examples of how
Russians]{.underline}** have **[misled]{.underline}** [**audiences in
the past**, or caused harm]{.underline}, and thus constantly reinforce
how unreliable they are as a source.

Another tactic is to appeal to Russians. This will be much harder, as
many Russians are skeptical of Western sources. However, there are early
indications that this conflict is not popular domestically. Russian
citizens in some cities have [taken to the
streets](https://twitter.com/nexta_tv/status/1496870591483330560?s=20&t=d0EJiP5MvOKcnIFKQAhpkg) to
protest the war. High-profile Russians
have [publicly](https://www.instagram.com/p/CaWghGfspVE/) [decried](https://www.instagram.com/p/CaWj5NCl-9k/) the
invasion. The ties that bind Russians and Ukrainians will make any
losses incurred by Russians extremely unpopular. Amplifying those losses
as much as possible will be demoralizing for Putin at home.

[Democracies]{.underline} also **[need to have counterfacts
ready]{.underline}**. [Russians]{.underline} and sympathetic Ukrainian
politicians have long [painted Ukrainians as fascists]{.underline},
pointing to World War II and modern far-right groups as evidence. While
Nazis drew support from upward of a quarter million Ukrainians, some 2
million were taken back to Germany as little more than slave laborers,
and yet millions more [enlisted in the Soviet
Army.](https://www.scribd.com/audiobook/333228450/The-Gates-of-Europe-A-History-of-Ukraine?utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=google_search&utm_campaign=3Q_Google_DSA_NB_RoW&utm_device=c&gclid=CjwKCAiA9tyQBhAIEiwA6tdCrJEHf9aiVohqa42Flp3hyNgmjtEef_mgz0JYxcWgpdubvz2dpQXSZBoCZd4QAvD_BwE) This
is to say nothing of what Ukrainians suffered under the Soviet Union,
from forced migrations to deliberate famines and the Chernobyl disaster.
Moreover, [**Moscow** now **uses de-Nazification** **as**]{.underline} a
**[pretense for invasion]{.underline} [while]{.underline}
[fostering]{.underline}** a [network of [**far-right groups
abroad**](https://carnegieendowment.org/2020/02/27/with-friends-like-these-kremlin-s-far-right-and-populist-connections-in-italy-and-austria-pub-81100)]{.underline}.
[Democracies]{.underline} [need to assert]{.underline} that if Russia is
so concerned about such elements, [Putin should [start cleaning his own
house
first](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/08/russia-is-co-opting-angry-young-men/568741/)]{.underline}.

In addition, [**democracies** **need** to keep **an eye
on**]{.underline} the [wider **geopolitics**]{.underline}. An
**[invasion]{.underline}** uncontested by Western partners in any form
but sanctions and stern warnings might **[encourage]{.underline}**
[other **actors**]{.underline} **[in Europe to]{.underline}** see an
opportunity to **[revise borders]{.underline}**. And there are [alarming
signs of]{.underline} [**conservative voices** on the other side of the
Atlantic **pushing Russian talking points**]{.underline}. It doesn't
seem like a stretch that the same forces behind the protests that took
over Ottawa for three weeks could be further provoked to erode support
for interventions to help Ukraine. Likewise, **[Russia]{.underline}**
[has been [**advocating** at the
UN](https://www.lawfareblog.com/why-are-authoritarians-framing-international-approaches-disinformation)]{.underline} [for
greater control over domestic]{.underline} [information
ecosystems]{.underline}---a form of **[digital
sovereignty]{.underline}**. It is **[crucial]{.underline}** that
[Western **democracies formulate**]{.underline} a
**[response]{.underline}** [in line with]{.underline} democratic
[values]{.underline}, lest Russia do so **[first]{.underline}**.

All the pretty words of support are meaningless if they cannot be backed
up with actions. Many Ukrainians felt abandoned by the West in 2014, and
actions like evacuating foreign embassies and advisers when the
Ukrainian government was calling on them once again fed a narrative of
abandonment. When such news is used by the Russian media to draw
parallels with the abandonment of Afghanistan, it reinforces a Russian
narrative that the West does not care about Ukraine. Beyond sanctions,
Western democracies must find meaningful gestures of support. One such
way these countries can aid [Ukraine is to join the fight against
Russia's long-standing disinformation campaign by taking pages from
Putin's own cyber playbook]{.underline}---holding the Russian regime to
account for its lies and past failures, while spotlighting the costs
ordinary Russians are paying for this folly.

### Scenario Analysis Good\-\--IR

#### Scenario analysis in the international realm is good\-\--allows nuances and complexities in IR and deconstructs dogma and bias!

Academy of Sciences and fellow at the Center for International Security

[Added-value of **scenario analysis** for IR scholarship]{.underline}

As Tomé and Açıkalın (2019) point out, in order [to **fill** the **gap
between IR theory and real-world problems**]{.underline}, "an increasing
number of [scholars have come to embrace]{.underline} a spirit of
[intellectual openness]{.underline}, [recognizing]{.underline} both [the
need for greater flexibility]{.underline} [in]{.underline} the
[theoretical]{.underline} [formulations]{.underline} and the possibility
of complementarity by other [theories and approaches]{.underline}" (p.
12). This section discusses the added value of scenario analysis as a
complementary approach to traditional IR methods. The [most obvious
advantage of scenario]{.underline} [analysis]{.underline} as a
methodology, grounded in the reservoir of foresight studies, [lies by
definition in its **ability to tackle future events**]{.underline}. As
mentioned before, [there are no specified instruments
within]{.underline} traditional [IR]{.underline} methods
[which]{.underline} would [allow scholars to go beyond past
and]{.underline} [present]{.underline}. The only exception is
forecasting, one of the formal methods in IR, which is, however,
distinctly different from foresight.9

The underlying logic of forecasting is to provide predictions about the
future by drawing on mathematical models and big data-sets based on
known patterns. Thus, it is not particularly suitable to accommodate
discontinuities. [Foresight]{.underline}, as described above, [aims
at]{.underline} [going beyond existing patterns by developing
alternative futures]{.underline} [based on an innovative combination of
multiple driving forces]{.underline}. Its [goal]{.underline} [is to
capture a set of possible futures and learn from]{.underline} [them by
examining the causal relations]{.underline} [between driving forces and
their]{.underline} different [evolutions]{.underline}. By [applying
scenario approaches]{.underline}, **[scholars]{.underline}
[can]{.underline}** thus **[account for evolving dynamics and
discuss]{.underline}** such **[timely issues]{.underline}** as the
consequences of Brexit for both British and EU-security, economics and
politics (Brakman, Garretsen, & Kohl, 2018; Martill & Sus, 2018;
Musolff, 2017; Verschueren, 2017; Ziv et al., 2018). Yet, scenario
analysis offers more than the possibility to talk about the future. We
see a fourfold merit of adding scenario analysis to the range of methods
applied by IR scholars.

**Confronting enduring assumptions**

As we presented in the previous section, the [main feature of
explorative scenarios]{.underline}, which are the subject of this paper,
[is to stimulate]{.underline} [creative thinking by
**challenging**]{.underline} the **[deeply held
assumptions]{.underline}** of their authors. In other words, this
[method is helpful for **overcoming**]{.underline} [**enduring
cognitive** **biases**]{.underline}---mental errors [such as linearity,
presentism, and group think caused by the subconscious]{.underline} [and
simplified]{.underline} [information processing of humans]{.underline}
(Heuer, 1999, pp. 111-- 112). [Humans have]{.underline} the
**[tendencies]{.underline} [to focus on the present]{.underline}** [at
the expense of]{.underline} [the future]{.underline} [**and** to **think
about**]{.underline} [**the future in** **linear terms**]{.underline}
[**by extrapolating past trends** into the future]{.underline}. As
Gaddis (1992) points out, "[we]{.underline} tend to [**bias** our
historical and our **theoretical analyses too much toward
continuity**]{.underline} (...) we [**rarely** **find a way to introduce
discontinuities**]{.underline} **[into theory]{.underline}**,
[or]{.underline} to attempt to [**determine** **what causes them to
happen**]{.underline}" (p. 52). Even if Gaddis does not explicitly
mention scenarios, he refers to the concepts underlying scenario
approaches (Han, 2011, p. 51). [Scenario analysis attends
to]{.underline} "[deeper]{.underline}, [otherwise left
implicit]{.underline}, [assumptions about continuous]{.underline} [and
linear patterns]{.underline} of development" (Wilkinson et al., 2013, p.
707). The [process]{.underline} of scenario development
[invites]{.underline} the [participants to]{.underline} [reveal and
question convictions]{.underline} [which]{.underline} [have]{.underline}
so far [remained unchallenged]{.underline}, and to question the
linearity of world developments.

The ability of [reexamining one's own assumptions]{.underline} [and
going beyond linear patterns]{.underline} of [development]{.underline}
[is essential for IR scholarship]{.underline}. To illustrate it with
[two examples]{.underline}: [IR scholars]{.underline} and historians
[did not think]{.underline} that [the]{.underline} [Soviet Union could
collapse]{.underline} and were startled by its fall, the peaceful
resolution of the Cold War and the transformation of the bipolar system
(Davis, 2005; Gaddis, 1992). In a similar vein, [United States scholars
were]{.underline} for decades so [convinced]{.underline} [of China's
economic, political, and cultural limitations]{.underline} [that they
neglected]{.underline} [the]{.underline} [possibility of its sudden
ascent]{.underline} and were taken by surprise when it happened
(Hundley, Kenzer, & Peterson, 2015). Interestingly, since the rise of
China became evident, the United States debate on its future has been
marked by a similar linearity of thought, leading to single-outcome
predictions of China's long-term future (Kerbel, 2004). In both cases,
the discipline proved incapable of anticipating events of such
importance, because [scholars took for granted the status quo instead of
confronting]{.underline} [their bias towards linearity and]{.underline}
[detect manifestations of upcoming change]{.underline}. [As a
result]{.underline}, two [major geopolitical
surprises]{.underline}---the end of the Cold War and the rise of China
have [at first]{.underline} been [neglected, forcing academia to catch
up]{.underline}.

Against this backdrop, **[foresight helps IR scholars]{.underline}** to
**[exit]{.underline}** the [**tunnel vision** on world
affairs]{.underline} and discover potentially valuable nonlinear lines
of development. These [can be]{.underline} both [innovative in terms of
scholarship, and policy-relevant]{.underline} by offering a reflection
on unexpected discontinuities. Thus, it can [**facilitate** the
**intellectual capability to think the unthinkable**]{.underline}
(Porter, 2016, p. 259).

**Bringing forward new research questions**

[Scenario analysis starts with confronting]{.underline}
[one's]{.underline} enduring [assumptions]{.underline} [and **developing
multiple causal possibilities**]{.underline}, through which [scholars
can]{.underline} potentially [discover topics that have not been
examined before]{.underline}. One of the greatest challenges for any
scholar is to identify innovative venues for research that might bring
the discipline forward and advance publicity for one's work. In
Lakatosian terms, such an ability is often considered an evidence of a
progressive research program.10 Since the [prime feature of scenario
analysis]{.underline} [is to **detect** **rapid and significant shifts
in trajectories**]{.underline}, or [the forces behind them]{.underline},
this [method]{.underline} [succors when **defining** **new pressing
topics**]{.underline} **[for academia]{.underline}**. In particular, as
mentioned in the previous section, scenario analysis enables the
detection of both weak signals and wild cards. By **[drawing attention
to]{.underline}** these hitherto **[overlooked]{.underline}** but
potentially [pressing issues]{.underline}, [scenario analysis can
identify **research**]{.underline} **[agendas]{.underline}** [for
further investigation]{.underline} (Barma et al., 2016). Therefore,
scenario analysis seems to be the right tool [to advance innovative
research]{.underline} since it helps scholars drive their research into
new areas, away from moribund topics that have been followed for many
decades. By "[identifying questions of likely future
significance]{.underline}" (Barma et al., 2016, p. 6), [scenario
analysis can]{.underline} [contribute to combatting]{.underline} the
proliferation of [researchers in fields occupying the political status
quo]{.underline}, such as Soviet or Japan studies in the United States
in the 1980s. At the same time, innovative research topics confront the
uncertainties that are crucial for policymakers to be monitored closely.

**Dealing with the complexity and interdisciplinarity of real-world
issues**

Another [added value of]{.underline} the [scenario analysis for IR
scholarship]{.underline} [lies]{.underline} [in]{.underline} its
[ability to **provide comprehensive causal reasoning**]{.underline}
**[and]{.underline}** thus to **[tackle complex issues]{.underline}**.
As mentioned in the introduction, the [**world's complexity** combined
with abrupt shifts]{.underline} [poses]{.underline} a [challenge for
IR]{.underline} [scholarship]{.underline}. The [possibility to
accommodate **multiple driving forces**]{.underline}, to [take into
account **different values** they might take]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} finally to **[combine them]{.underline}** with each
other [and see how they affect the dependent variable]{.underline},
**[makes]{.underline}** the **[scenario]{.underline}
[approach]{.underline}** quite **[unique]{.underline}**. Traditional IR
methods work with a limited number of independent variables, formulate
and test hypotheses usually based on the relation between a single
causal variable and the dependent variable. Investigating complex causal
trajectories is therefore not possible. Against this background, we
agree with Barma et al. (2016) and his colleagues who argue that
[scenarios are highly apt for dealing with]{.underline}
[complexity]{.underline} [and uncertainty and **providing
academia**]{.underline} **[with a tool for "actionable]{.underline}
[clarity]{.underline}** [in understanding contemporary global
issues"]{.underline} (p. 1).

Moreover, the [scenario approach]{.underline} [helps]{.underline} to
**[tackle]{.underline}** the [**challenges of interdisciplinarity** that
is **tied to complexity**]{.underline}. By [drawing on]{.underline} the
**[active]{.underline} [participation of people from different
disciplines]{.underline}**[, **backgrounds, and** with different
**expertise**]{.underline} in the scenario development process, it
[brings]{.underline} [interdisciplinarity to the table]{.underline} by
default. The key advantage of the approach is that this
interdisciplinary conversation takes place prior to and during the
research phase, rather than after it. This distinguishes the scenario
approach from other methods that bring interdisciplinary perspectives
together but do not [facilitate a discussion between them]{.underline},
rather letting them passively co-exist. By [exploring]{.underline} the
[dynamics between seemingly unrelated vectors of change]{.underline}
(key drivers), scenario [analysis]{.underline} can be [useful for
shedding light on developments]{.underline} that would have been
[overlooked by narrower research designs]{.underline}. [In security
studies]{.underline}, for example, scenario **[analysis]{.underline}**
[can **connect the dots between hard, soft, traditional and
non-traditional understandings of security**]{.underline} and capture
the interplay of economic-societalenvironmental and technological
changes. Imposing [interdisciplinarity]{.underline} also
[helps]{.underline} to [**counter**]{.underline} the
"**[hyper-fragmentation of knowledge]{.underline}**" that "makes it
difficult for even scholars in different disciplines to understand each
other, much less policy-makers and general public" (Desch, 2015, p.
381).

Complex real-world issues that were tackled using scenario analysis
include the Israel-Palestine conflict (Stein et al., 1998), Turkey's
geopolitical environment (Çelik & Blum, 2007), the prospects of the
United States-- China conflict (Friedberg, 2005) and the consequences of
Brexit for EU foreign and security policy (Martill & Sus, 2018). An
examination of these topics without the application of interdisciplinary
approaches would not be possible precisely due to their multifaceted
character.
