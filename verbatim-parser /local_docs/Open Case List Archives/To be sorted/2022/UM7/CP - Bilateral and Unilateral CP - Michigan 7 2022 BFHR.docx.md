A RATIONAL CHOICE EXAMINATION OF FINDINGS

**[The rational choice]{.underline}** **[explanation]{.underline}**
**[for]{.underline}** continued **[burden sharing by new]{.underline}**
**[members of NATO]{.underline}** **[after]{.underline}**
**[accession]{.underline}** **[emphasizes]{.underline}** the **[benefits
of maintaining]{.underline}** **[a]{.underline}** **[reputation as a
credible partner]{.underline}**. Certainly, members join and remain in
NATO for both the tangible and the intangible benefits of being in a
powerful alliance. With a combined population of almost 880 million and
a combined gross domestic product (GDP) of \$28.5 trillion,4 NATO
membership offers a degree of physical and psychological security to its
member states.

The rational benefits of being in an alliance have also been studied in
international relations theory. In his game-theoretic study of
alliances, Alastair Smith found that defensive alliances deterred
aggression. The more reliable the alliance was, the greater the
deterrent effect it had. In his words, "nations form alliances because
it improves the outcomes they expect to receive."5 Certainly, this
concern for physical and psychological security was influential in the
burden sharing decisions of recent new NATO members. As the current
Romanian President said in an interview, "with the accession to NATO,
the Romanians felt safe . . . NATO meant the beginning of our road to
prosperity."6

Finally, a rational choice explanation might emphasize the quid pro quo
that supports burden sharing decisions of member states in NATO.
Certainly, **[there have been side payments made by the]{.underline}**
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[to]{.underline}**
new **[member states]{.underline}** in order **[to
encourage]{.underline}** **[greater levels of military
spending]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}** in order **[to reward
contributions]{.underline}** **[to]{.underline}** NATO and **[U.S.-led
missions]{.underline}** **[in the war on terrorism]{.underline}**. For
example, **[Poland]{.underline}** **[received]{.underline}** a generous
**[\$3.5 billion loan]{.underline}** **[to buy F16
aircraft]{.underline}** **[after]{.underline}**
**[committing]{.underline}** sizable **[forces to
Operation]{.underline}** **[IRAQI FREEDOM]{.underline}** (OIF).7 In
addition, NATO established the Joint Forces Training Centre in Poland in
2004. **[Both the Czech Republic]{.underline}** **[and
Hungary]{.underline}** **[received]{.underline}** side **[payments from
the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
**[for their support]{.underline}** **[in the war on
terror]{.underline}**ism.8 In 2002, the 1999 wave of new members
received a combined \$35 million in Foreign Military Financing with an
equal amount requested for 2003 and 2004.9 Estonia, one of the 2004
waves of new NATO members, was scheduled to receive over \$6 million per
year over the same period.10 In 2005, in addition to normal
International Military Education and Training (IMET) and Foreign
Military Financing (FMF) assistance, President George W. Bush requested
\$200 million from Congress "for coalition allies that have supported
military efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan."11 NATO also uses incentives
to influence its member states. These incentives include investments in
infrastructure resources by NATO common funds. For example, Poland
funded most of its airfield renovation program through the NATO Security
Investment Program (NSIP).12 Romania, a big supporter of both OIF and
the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), was rewarded with
the rotation of U.S. forces into Romania for training as part of Joint
Task Force East.13

While the side payments discussed above provide some incentive, NATO has
the greatest leverage over aspiring member states prior to accession
through conditionality. In the case of NATO, conditionality consists of
"specific conditions which an aspiring state must fulfill before
accession. These conditions comprised of both adherence to the community
values and the ability to contribute to the functional tasks of the
organization."14 The assessment of whether or not these conditions have
been met is a subjective and very political matter. Oftentimes,
geostrategic concerns can trump accomplishment of accession standards,
as in the case of Georgia and the Ukraine, which have not been granted
admittance into the Membership Action Plan (MAP) due to concerns over
relations with Russia. Accession into NATO requires unanimous agreement
by existing members and ratification by the legislatures of the member
states. It is not surprising, then, that aspiring NATO members are keen
to demonstrate they have not only met the intent of the conditions
established, but also the objective benchmarks established by the
Alliance. One of the two most recent NATO members, Albania, is a good
example. In a recent visit to NATO Headquarters, Albanian
representatives were "very proud to say they (were) meeting the 2% (GDP)
benchmark as well as deployment and sustainability criteria."15 These
public declarations support the explanations based on conditionality and
are consistent with the burden sharing behavior of new member states
reviewed earlier.

Not surprisingly, conditionality was an effective tool in influencing
aspiring NATO members. In Judith Kelley's study of international
institutions in the early post-Cold War period, she found that
membership prerequisites were an essential factor in changing state
behavior.16 Kelley also acknowledged that socialization played a role.
Kelley found that while most changes in state behavior could be
attributed to conditionality, "socialization-based efforts often guided
them."17 Yet, these explanations alone cannot explain why new NATO
members did not free-ride once they became members of NATO. In fact,
many new members increased their troop support to NATO missions after
gaining membership. NATO Director of Policy

Planning Jamie Shea specifically addressed the issue of free-riding
incentives after accession.

> The argument that once in the alliance, new members will slack off is
> not fair. For example, Romania currently has 720 (troops) deployed to
> Afghanistan and is trying to find another 120. That is not a bad
> effort for a new NATO member.18

However, **[conditionality is just one incentive to
induce]{.underline}** norm **[conforming]{.underline}** behavior.

NATO has **[several informal mechanisms to reward states]{.underline}**
**[that support Alliance efforts]{.underline}** **[after being granted
membership]{.underline}**. **[Research has shown that rewards
can]{.underline}** **[help states]{.underline}** to **[overcome the
incentives to free-ride]{.underline}**.19 First, NATO uses a **[variety
of prestige rewards]{.underline}** **[that]{.underline}** are **[not
only beneficial for]{.underline}** **[domestic]{.underline}** political
**[use]{.underline}**, **[but are sought out]{.underline}**
**[by]{.underline}** **[both diplomatic and military]{.underline}**
**[bureaucrats]{.underline}** for their own benefit. These rewards
**[range from hosting summits]{.underline}**,
**[conferences]{.underline}**, **[or exercises to the assignment of
commands]{.underline}** and staff positions. One example of these types
of rewards is called "flags to post." A flags to post conference is
convened to assign general officer billets to member states. These
conferences often result in a contentious debate; these leadership
positions not only yield influence in the Alliance but also prestige at
home to the officers assigned to fill them.

During NATO missions, command positions are also allocated on the basis
of relative troop contributions. Unless the forces are under a standing
NATO Headquarters, such as the Allied Rapid Reaction Corps, then command
usually goes to the state with the largest number of troops in that
sector or in the overall mission. NATO also provides material incentives
in the form of investments. This reward allows leaders to bring home the
bacon to their national constituents and thus build support for
contributions to NATO. For example, NATO investment into Poland exceeded
Poland's contributions to NATO's infrastructure budget in 2004.20 A
portion of these NATO funds is being used to construct a training
facility in the city of Bydgoszcz.21 This facility will cost
approximately 33 million Euros to build. Finally, **[individual states
within NATO]{.underline}** **[often]{.underline}** **[provide
incentives]{.underline}** **[to other members]{.underline}** **[to
reward cooperation]{.underline}**. **[As the largest and most powerful
member (and leader) of the Alliance]{.underline}**,
**[the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
often times **[provides these incentives]{.underline}**.

#### Allies [say yes]{.underline}\-\--they have [mutual incentives]{.underline} to partner with the US in the [expectation]{.underline} of future security assistance.

**[In the realm of]{.underline}** security sector
**[assistance]{.underline}**, **[experience]{.underline}** **[has
been]{.underline}** **[disproportionately focused on negative
approaches]{.underline}**, **[almost]{.underline}** **[always negative
and ex post]{.underline}**. In addition to Egypt, Indonesia, and
Pakistan, **[the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[has sought to limit]{.underline}** or cut
off **[security]{.underline}** sector **[assistance]{.underline}** in El
Salvador in the 1980s, Rwanda in 2012, Bahrain in 2011, and Burundi in
2015. All these efforts followed the ex post/negative pattern in which
the United States has taken essentially punitive measures to reframe an
existing security sector assistance relationship. One might view the
application of the Leahy Law, which restricts assistance in cases of
human rights abuse, or post-coup legal restrictions as cases of ex
ante/negative conditionality, given that partners are expected to be
aware of these condition-triggering laws prior to the acceptance of
assistance or the commission of violations.

By contrast, **[examples of positive conditionality in
the]{.underline}** security sector **[assistance]{.underline}**
**[arena]{.underline}** **[have been few and far between]{.underline}**,
even though the idea is not particularly new. "**[Incentive-based
conditions"]{.underline}** might **[tie additional]{.underline}** and/or
more **[sophisticated levels of security]{.underline}** sector
**[assistance]{.underline}**, **[including new military capabilities
or]{.underline}** **[specific]{.underline}** weapons
**[platforms]{.underline}**, **[to reform milestones]{.underline}**
**[to incentivize]{.underline}** behavioral **[changes]{.underline}**.
In addition, **[rather than authorizing aid]{.underline}** **[and then
withholding it]{.underline}**, on the basis of shared interests,
**[the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
**[might]{.underline}** **[identify positive actions]{.underline}**
**[that a recipient]{.underline}** **[is considering]{.underline}**
**[taking]{.underline}** **[and then incentivize them]{.underline}**.
More recently, the U.S. Institute for Peace Task Force on Extremism in
Fragile States argued for "graduated security sector assistance," in
which the United States calibrates its engagement with fragile states
according to a jointly agreed plan that enables partners in those
countries to achieve escalating levels and types of U.S. security sector
assistance as partners achieve reform milestones leading to more
inclusive governance. These recommendations build on recent experiments
in new government approaches to security sector assistance, such as the
Security Governance Initiative, which have sought to establish joint
bilateral planning on the basis of overlapping interests as the
foundation of assistance programs, though these initiatives have not
ultimately meaningfully conditioned assistance. The challenge has been
that, while **[positive conditionality]{.underline}** has been posited
as a potentially viable and beneficial approach to improving security
sector assistance outcomes, it **[has neither been sufficiently
attempted]{.underline}** in practice **[nor sufficiently
elaborated]{.underline}** in literature.

Toward a Framework for Positive Conditionality

What if the United States had approached its relationship with Uganda
differently in pursuit of shared objectives? It's possible that if the
United States had structured its assistance in a way that incentivized
Uganda's politicians and security officials to take specific steps
toward clearly --- and mutually --- identified milestones, that could
have led to the development of stronger capabilities for and commitment
to civilian protection and governance by Uganda's military over time.
Instead, a reactive posture to human rights and corruption
transgressions has had limited effects, and punitive measures may only
strain the relationship and undermine possibilities for cooperation.

**[The]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
**[should develop a framework]{.underline}** **[for]{.underline}**
**[positive conditionality]{.underline}** **[in security]{.underline}**
sector **[assistance]{.underline}** **[to better shape]{.underline}**
**[political]{.underline}** and security **[outcomes]{.underline}**
**[with]{.underline}** **[partner countries]{.underline}**. On balance
an affirmative framework will offer the United States the widest
latitude in shaping outcomes in a broad range of circumstances. This
approach also does not rule out the sequencing of punitive steps --- or
a pause to assess partner performance.

First, this framework assumes an ex ante/positive approach to
conditionality, at least in some manner. **[With the U.S. government
providing]{.underline}** **[security]{.underline}** sector **[assistance
to nearly 200 countries]{.underline}** around the world, **[it is
unlikely]{.underline}** **[that the]{.underline}**
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[will be
initiating]{.underline}** **[a security]{.underline}** sector
**[assistance]{.underline}** **[relationship wholly from
scratch]{.underline}**. **[An ex ante approach]{.underline}**
**[would]{.underline}** **[focus on developing]{.underline}** concrete
plans, including **[triggers]{.underline}** **[for clearly identified
conditions]{.underline}**, at the inception of an initiative or set of
programs. It should involve a plan covering at least five years,
identifying ultimate objectives and intermediate milestones, a theory of
change for how objectives will be achieved, and metrics to provide a
basis for assessing progress. Policymakers and planners can then link
conditions to milestones and metrics. Moreover, such an approach builds
on recognized best practices for capacity-building initiatives.

Second, the framework must include a partner government's mutual
participation in the creation of the assistance plan, the identification
of objectives, and the agreement on conditions. The partner will be more
incentivized to progress toward objectives when it understands and
commits to such objectives based on its own identified interests. A
memorandum of understanding, bilateral compact, or some other formal
written instrument can commit both parties to its terms.

Third, the framework should structure conditions as positive inducements
for the recipient to take steps toward milestones or objectives.
Milestones could include completion of defense institutional reforms,
starting with development of a process to align budget to strategy,
progressing to completion of a first budget cycle with the new process,
and culminating in institutionalization of the process through policy
and/or law. **[They]{.underline}** might also **[include progress
toward]{.underline}** capability or **[interoperability
milestones]{.underline}** (e.g., **[ability to conduct]{.underline}**
nighttime **[counter-terrorism operations]{.underline}** **[in
accordance with]{.underline}** the **[laws]{.underline}** of armed
conflict or **[c]{.underline}**ommand **[and]{.underline}**
**[c]{.underline}**ontrol **[and intelligence integration]{.underline}**
**[across platforms]{.underline}** and systems). In addition,
**[milestones could include]{.underline}**
**[transparency]{.underline}** **[and accountability]{.underline}**
**[activities]{.underline}** (e.g., publication of public budget,
completion of audit, investigation of specific incidents of resource
waste and abuse or diversion, establishment and activity of an
independent third-party investigative unit for accountability).

**[Partners]{.underline}** **[will]{.underline}** likely **[respond to
inducements]{.underline}** **[that are material]{.underline}** in
nature, including access to an expanded variety of types of assistance
and an expanded quantity of assistance. However,
**[partners]{.underline}** may also **[value incentives]{.underline}**
**[such as eligibility]{.underline}** **[for key
agreements]{.underline}** **[to facilitate access]{.underline}** **[and
information]{.underline}** and/or technology **[sharing]{.underline}**
(e.g., acquisition and cross-servicing, general security of military
information, etc.) **[or eligibility for expanded
partnership]{.underline}** **[opportunities]{.underline}** (e.g.,
National Guard State Partnership Program or the Military Personnel
Exchange Program). Moreover, incentives may also be political, such as
access to membership in certain organizations or eligibility for certain
agreements.

Such inducements are consistent with the Task Force on Extremism in
Fragile States' concept of graduated assistance: As a partner achieves
key milestones, it is able to "graduate" into a new status that allows
it to access increasing quantities and types of assistance, as well as
other benefits. Policymakers should tailor the potential tiers of access
and associated benefits, as well as the milestones triggering graduation
to a higher tier, to the individual recipient, and accordingly integrate
them into bilateral development plans or compacts, as discussed above. A
possible tiering of graduated assistance could include:

Tier One: nonlethal training and individual education.

Tier Two: comprehensive training and nonlethal equipment.

Tier Three: lethal equipment and access to U.S. military staff colleges.

Tier Four: high-level exercises, high-level staff talks, and joint and
combined planning and operations.

Yet, for fragile states with weak security institutions, the task force
rightly notes that assistance should initially focus on institutional
reforms, with "increasingly sophisticated and lethal capabilities and
equipment ... contingent on sustained improvements in security sector
governance." The reforms should also institutionalize inclusivity. In
practice, such an approach may prove difficult if partner governments or
their security forces are vested in a corrupt status quo, such that
institutional reform poses an existential threat or compromise to their
personal gains. In such partnerships, identifying geographic areas or
bureaucratic processes that may be more receptive to change first should
be the focus of investment, and may be most successful if there are
third parties, such as other allies and partners, media, or civil
society that are calling for similar changes. For a potential coalition
partner with comparatively good governance, on the other hand,
milestones and incentives may be built around coalition interoperability
and the capability to perform certain roles within the coalition
context. In collaboration with the partner, U.S. policymakers should
design a program of graduated or tiered assistance, structuring
incentives and milestones across the full portfolio of security sector
assistance. The total program of assistance could grow in both scope and
sophistication as the partner progresses through milestones.

In addition, within each broad category of security sector assistance
provided by the United States, policymakers and planners may find
opportunities to moderate U.S. investments based on a partner's progress
(in other words, in relation to specific security sector assistance
lines of effort). The table below outlines engagement at low, moderate,
and high levels across several broad assistance categories as they could
be applied within the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command area of responsibility.
As planners construct graduated assistance programs, they thus have
options to moderate assistance both within a specific type of support
and across the full portfolio of security sector assistance. In
practice, the categories and degrees of security sector assistance
options would be tailored to meet the objectives of the specific partner
relationship.\*\*\*FIGURE 1 OMITTED\*\*\* Importantly, conditions should
be based on realistic assumptions about what partners would be willing
to do (in terms of both what steps can be realistically expected given
the recipient's unique political and institutional context as well as
what leverage relatively small sums of U.S. assistance can be expected
to produce). Also, conditions should be accompanied by concrete U.S.
commitments. **[Positive conditionality]{.underline}**
**[will]{.underline}** **[quickly cease]{.underline}** **[to be
attractive]{.underline}** **[to partners]{.underline}** **[when
the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
**[fails to follow through]{.underline}** **[on a promised
inducement]{.underline}**.

Of course, following through in this manner requires sustained
availability of funding. Many security sector assistance programs have
significant flexibility in the availability of appropriated funds over
time. More importantly, in our experience, programs with more rigor in
strategy and long-term planning are likely to win the sustained support
of congressional appropriators.

**[This]{.underline}** proposed **[model of positive
conditionality]{.underline}** **[offers new possibilities]{.underline}**
**[not only for incenting]{.underline}** **[partners]{.underline}**
**[to take steps toward]{.underline}** shared
**[objectives]{.underline}** **[but also for improving
planning]{.underline}** **[and management]{.underline}**
**[of]{.underline}** security sector **[assistance]{.underline}**
**[resources]{.underline}**. Assistance programs are structured such
that the achievement of each milestone triggers an expansion of the
assistance relationship. **[Each step also provides]{.underline}** **[an
opportunity]{.underline}** **[for an assessment]{.underline}** of goals
and progress**[. It enables planners to incorporate natural
mechanisms]{.underline}** **[to provide]{.underline}** **[exit
ramps]{.underline}**, through which the U.S. or partner government can
determine to terminate the initiative, or to restructure efforts to
achieve a defined milestone. To be effective, it is critical that
overarching objectives, as well as milestones leading toward those
objectives, are specific, measurable, and time bound.

A RATIONAL CHOICE EXAMINATION OF FINDINGS

**[The rational choice]{.underline}** **[explanation]{.underline}**
**[for]{.underline}** continued **[burden sharing by new]{.underline}**
**[members of NATO]{.underline}** **[after]{.underline}**
**[accession]{.underline}** **[emphasizes]{.underline}** the **[benefits

Certainly, **[there have been side payments made by the]{.underline}**

new **[member states]{.underline}** in order **[to

aircraft]{.underline}** **[after]{.underline}**
**[committing]{.underline}** sizable **[forces to

waves of new NATO members, was scheduled to receive over \$6 million per
year over the same period.10 In 2005, in addition to normal
International Military Education and Training (IMET) and Foreign
Military Financing (FMF) assistance, President George W. Bush requested
\$200 million from Congress "for coalition allies that have supported
military efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan."11 NATO also uses incentives
to influence its member states. These incentives include investments in
infrastructure resources by NATO common funds. For example, Poland
funded most of its airfield renovation program through the NATO Security
Investment Program (NSIP).12 Romania, a big supporter of both OIF and
the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), was rewarded with
the rotation of U.S. forces into Romania for training as part of Joint
Task Force East.13

While the side payments discussed above provide some incentive, NATO has
the greatest leverage over aspiring member states prior to accession
through conditionality. In the case of NATO, conditionality consists of
"specific conditions which an aspiring state must fulfill before
accession. These conditions comprised of both adherence to the community
values and the ability to contribute to the functional tasks of the
organization."14 The assessment of whether or not these conditions have
been met is a subjective and very political matter. Oftentimes,
geostrategic concerns can trump accomplishment of accession standards,
as in the case of Georgia and the Ukraine, which have not been granted
admittance into the Membership Action Plan (MAP) due to concerns over
relations with Russia. Accession into NATO requires unanimous agreement
by existing members and ratification by the legislatures of the member
states. It is not surprising, then, that aspiring NATO members are keen
to demonstrate they have not only met the intent of the conditions
established, but also the objective benchmarks established by the
Alliance. One of the two most recent NATO members, Albania, is a good
example. In a recent visit to NATO Headquarters, Albanian
representatives were "very proud to say they (were) meeting the 2% (GDP)
benchmark as well as deployment and sustainability criteria."15 These
public declarations support the explanations based on conditionality and
are consistent with the burden sharing behavior of new member states
reviewed earlier.

Not surprisingly, conditionality was an effective tool in influencing
aspiring NATO members. In Judith Kelley's study of international
institutions in the early post-Cold War period, she found that
membership prerequisites were an essential factor in changing state
behavior.16 Kelley also acknowledged that socialization played a role.
Kelley found that while most changes in state behavior could be
attributed to conditionality, "socialization-based efforts often guided
them."17 Yet, these explanations alone cannot explain why new NATO
members did not free-ride once they became members of NATO. In fact,
many new members increased their troop support to NATO missions after
gaining membership. NATO Director of Policy

Planning Jamie Shea specifically addressed the issue of free-riding
incentives after accession.

> The argument that once in the alliance, new members will slack off is
> not fair. For example, Romania currently has 720 (troops) deployed to
> Afghanistan and is trying to find another 120. That is not a bad
> effort for a new NATO member.18

However, **[conditionality is just one incentive to
induce]{.underline}** norm **[conforming]{.underline}** behavior.

NATO has **[several informal mechanisms to reward states]{.underline}**
**[that support Alliance efforts]{.underline}** **[after being granted
membership]{.underline}**. **[Research has shown that rewards
can]{.underline}** **[help states]{.underline}** to **[overcome the
incentives to free-ride]{.underline}**.19 First, NATO uses a **[variety
of prestige rewards]{.underline}** **[that]{.underline}** are **[not
only beneficial for]{.underline}** **[domestic]{.underline}** political
**[use]{.underline}**, **[but are sought out]{.underline}**
**[by]{.underline}** **[both diplomatic and military]{.underline}**
**[bureaucrats]{.underline}** for their own benefit. These rewards
**[range from hosting summits]{.underline}**,
**[conferences]{.underline}**, **[or exercises to the assignment of
commands]{.underline}** and staff positions. One example of these types
of rewards is called "flags to post." A flags to post conference is
convened to assign general officer billets to member states. These
conferences often result in a contentious debate; these leadership
positions not only yield influence in the Alliance but also prestige at
home to the officers assigned to fill them.

During NATO missions, command positions are also allocated on the basis
of relative troop contributions. Unless the forces are under a standing
NATO Headquarters, such as the Allied Rapid Reaction Corps, then command
usually goes to the state with the largest number of troops in that
sector or in the overall mission. NATO also provides material incentives
in the form of investments. This reward allows leaders to bring home the
bacon to their national constituents and thus build support for
contributions to NATO. For example, NATO investment into Poland exceeded
Poland's contributions to NATO's infrastructure budget in 2004.20 A
portion of these NATO funds is being used to construct a training
facility in the city of Bydgoszcz.21 This facility will cost
approximately 33 million Euros to build. Finally, **[individual states
within NATO]{.underline}** **[often]{.underline}** **[provide
incentives]{.underline}** **[to other members]{.underline}** **[to
reward cooperation]{.underline}**. **[As the largest and most powerful
member (and leader) of the Alliance]{.underline}**,
**[the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
often times **[provides these incentives]{.underline}**.

#### Allies [say yes]{.underline}\-\--they have [mutual incentives]{.underline} to partner with the US in the [expectation]{.underline} of future security assistance.

**[In the realm of]{.underline}** security sector
**[assistance]{.underline}**, **[experience]{.underline}** **[has
been]{.underline}** **[disproportionately focused on negative
approaches]{.underline}**, **[almost]{.underline}** **[always negative
and ex post]{.underline}**. In addition to Egypt, Indonesia, and
Pakistan, **[the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[has sought to limit]{.underline}** or cut
off **[security]{.underline}** sector **[assistance]{.underline}** in El
Salvador in the 1980s, Rwanda in 2012, Bahrain in 2011, and Burundi in
2015. All these efforts followed the ex post/negative pattern in which
the United States has taken essentially punitive measures to reframe an
existing security sector assistance relationship. One might view the
application of the Leahy Law, which restricts assistance in cases of
human rights abuse, or post-coup legal restrictions as cases of ex
ante/negative conditionality, given that partners are expected to be
aware of these condition-triggering laws prior to the acceptance of
assistance or the commission of violations.

By contrast, **[examples of positive conditionality in
the]{.underline}** security sector **[assistance]{.underline}**
**[arena]{.underline}** **[have been few and far between]{.underline}**,
even though the idea is not particularly new. "**[Incentive-based
conditions"]{.underline}** might **[tie additional]{.underline}** and/or
more **[sophisticated levels of security]{.underline}** sector
**[assistance]{.underline}**, **[including new military capabilities
or]{.underline}** **[specific]{.underline}** weapons
**[platforms]{.underline}**, **[to reform milestones]{.underline}**
**[to incentivize]{.underline}** behavioral **[changes]{.underline}**.
In addition, **[rather than authorizing aid]{.underline}** **[and then
withholding it]{.underline}**, on the basis of shared interests,
**[the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
**[might]{.underline}** **[identify positive actions]{.underline}**
**[that a recipient]{.underline}** **[is considering]{.underline}**
**[taking]{.underline}** **[and then incentivize them]{.underline}**.
More recently, the U.S. Institute for Peace Task Force on Extremism in
Fragile States argued for "graduated security sector assistance," in
which the United States calibrates its engagement with fragile states
according to a jointly agreed plan that enables partners in those
countries to achieve escalating levels and types of U.S. security sector
assistance as partners achieve reform milestones leading to more
inclusive governance. These recommendations build on recent experiments
in new government approaches to security sector assistance, such as the
Security Governance Initiative, which have sought to establish joint
bilateral planning on the basis of overlapping interests as the
foundation of assistance programs, though these initiatives have not
ultimately meaningfully conditioned assistance. The challenge has been
that, while **[positive conditionality]{.underline}** has been posited
as a potentially viable and beneficial approach to improving security
sector assistance outcomes, it **[has neither been sufficiently
attempted]{.underline}** in practice **[nor sufficiently
elaborated]{.underline}** in literature.

Toward a Framework for Positive Conditionality

What if the United States had approached its relationship with Uganda
differently in pursuit of shared objectives? It's possible that if the
United States had structured its assistance in a way that incentivized
Uganda's politicians and security officials to take specific steps
toward clearly --- and mutually --- identified milestones, that could
have led to the development of stronger capabilities for and commitment
to civilian protection and governance by Uganda's military over time.
Instead, a reactive posture to human rights and corruption
transgressions has had limited effects, and punitive measures may only
strain the relationship and undermine possibilities for cooperation.

**[The]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
**[should develop a framework]{.underline}** **[for]{.underline}**
**[positive conditionality]{.underline}** **[in security]{.underline}**
sector **[assistance]{.underline}** **[to better shape]{.underline}**
**[political]{.underline}** and security **[outcomes]{.underline}**
**[with]{.underline}** **[partner countries]{.underline}**. On balance
an affirmative framework will offer the United States the widest
latitude in shaping outcomes in a broad range of circumstances. This
approach also does not rule out the sequencing of punitive steps --- or
a pause to assess partner performance.

First, this framework assumes an ex ante/positive approach to
conditionality, at least in some manner. **[With the U.S. government
providing]{.underline}** **[security]{.underline}** sector **[assistance
to nearly 200 countries]{.underline}** around the world, **[it is
unlikely]{.underline}** **[that the]{.underline}**
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[will be
initiating]{.underline}** **[a security]{.underline}** sector
**[assistance]{.underline}** **[relationship wholly from
scratch]{.underline}**. **[An ex ante approach]{.underline}**
**[would]{.underline}** **[focus on developing]{.underline}** concrete
plans, including **[triggers]{.underline}** **[for clearly identified
conditions]{.underline}**, at the inception of an initiative or set of
programs. It should involve a plan covering at least five years,
identifying ultimate objectives and intermediate milestones, a theory of
change for how objectives will be achieved, and metrics to provide a
basis for assessing progress. Policymakers and planners can then link
conditions to milestones and metrics. Moreover, such an approach builds
on recognized best practices for capacity-building initiatives.

Second, the framework must include a partner government's mutual
participation in the creation of the assistance plan, the identification
of objectives, and the agreement on conditions. The partner will be more
incentivized to progress toward objectives when it understands and
commits to such objectives based on its own identified interests. A
memorandum of understanding, bilateral compact, or some other formal
written instrument can commit both parties to its terms.

Third, the framework should structure conditions as positive inducements
for the recipient to take steps toward milestones or objectives.
Milestones could include completion of defense institutional reforms,
starting with development of a process to align budget to strategy,
progressing to completion of a first budget cycle with the new process,
and culminating in institutionalization of the process through policy
and/or law. **[They]{.underline}** might also **[include progress
toward]{.underline}** capability or **[interoperability
milestones]{.underline}** (e.g., **[ability to conduct]{.underline}**
nighttime **[counter-terrorism operations]{.underline}** **[in
accordance with]{.underline}** the **[laws]{.underline}** of armed
conflict or **[c]{.underline}**ommand **[and]{.underline}**
**[c]{.underline}**ontrol **[and intelligence integration]{.underline}**
**[across platforms]{.underline}** and systems). In addition,
**[milestones could include]{.underline}**
**[transparency]{.underline}** **[and accountability]{.underline}**
**[activities]{.underline}** (e.g., publication of public budget,
completion of audit, investigation of specific incidents of resource
waste and abuse or diversion, establishment and activity of an
independent third-party investigative unit for accountability).

**[Partners]{.underline}** **[will]{.underline}** likely **[respond to
inducements]{.underline}** **[that are material]{.underline}** in
nature, including access to an expanded variety of types of assistance
and an expanded quantity of assistance. However,
**[partners]{.underline}** may also **[value incentives]{.underline}**
**[such as eligibility]{.underline}** **[for key
agreements]{.underline}** **[to facilitate access]{.underline}** **[and
information]{.underline}** and/or technology **[sharing]{.underline}**
(e.g., acquisition and cross-servicing, general security of military
information, etc.) **[or eligibility for expanded
partnership]{.underline}** **[opportunities]{.underline}** (e.g.,
National Guard State Partnership Program or the Military Personnel
Exchange Program). Moreover, incentives may also be political, such as
access to membership in certain organizations or eligibility for certain
agreements.

Such inducements are consistent with the Task Force on Extremism in
Fragile States' concept of graduated assistance: As a partner achieves
key milestones, it is able to "graduate" into a new status that allows
it to access increasing quantities and types of assistance, as well as
other benefits. Policymakers should tailor the potential tiers of access
and associated benefits, as well as the milestones triggering graduation
to a higher tier, to the individual recipient, and accordingly integrate
them into bilateral development plans or compacts, as discussed above. A
possible tiering of graduated assistance could include:

Tier One: nonlethal training and individual education.

Tier Two: comprehensive training and nonlethal equipment.

Tier Three: lethal equipment and access to U.S. military staff colleges.

Tier Four: high-level exercises, high-level staff talks, and joint and
combined planning and operations.

Yet, for fragile states with weak security institutions, the task force
rightly notes that assistance should initially focus on institutional
reforms, with "increasingly sophisticated and lethal capabilities and
equipment ... contingent on sustained improvements in security sector
governance." The reforms should also institutionalize inclusivity. In
practice, such an approach may prove difficult if partner governments or
their security forces are vested in a corrupt status quo, such that
institutional reform poses an existential threat or compromise to their
personal gains. In such partnerships, identifying geographic areas or
bureaucratic processes that may be more receptive to change first should
be the focus of investment, and may be most successful if there are
third parties, such as other allies and partners, media, or civil
society that are calling for similar changes. For a potential coalition
partner with comparatively good governance, on the other hand,
milestones and incentives may be built around coalition interoperability
and the capability to perform certain roles within the coalition
context. In collaboration with the partner, U.S. policymakers should
design a program of graduated or tiered assistance, structuring
incentives and milestones across the full portfolio of security sector
assistance. The total program of assistance could grow in both scope and
sophistication as the partner progresses through milestones.

In addition, within each broad category of security sector assistance
provided by the United States, policymakers and planners may find
opportunities to moderate U.S. investments based on a partner's progress
(in other words, in relation to specific security sector assistance
lines of effort). The table below outlines engagement at low, moderate,
and high levels across several broad assistance categories as they could
be applied within the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command area of responsibility.
As planners construct graduated assistance programs, they thus have
options to moderate assistance both within a specific type of support
and across the full portfolio of security sector assistance. In
practice, the categories and degrees of security sector assistance
options would be tailored to meet the objectives of the specific partner
relationship.\*\*\*FIGURE 1 OMITTED\*\*\* Importantly, conditions should
be based on realistic assumptions about what partners would be willing
to do (in terms of both what steps can be realistically expected given
the recipient's unique political and institutional context as well as
what leverage relatively small sums of U.S. assistance can be expected
to produce). Also, conditions should be accompanied by concrete U.S.
commitments. **[Positive conditionality]{.underline}**
**[will]{.underline}** **[quickly cease]{.underline}** **[to be
attractive]{.underline}** **[to partners]{.underline}** **[when
the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
**[fails to follow through]{.underline}** **[on a promised
inducement]{.underline}**.

Of course, following through in this manner requires sustained
availability of funding. Many security sector assistance programs have
significant flexibility in the availability of appropriated funds over
time. More importantly, in our experience, programs with more rigor in
strategy and long-term planning are likely to win the sustained support
of congressional appropriators.

**[This]{.underline}** proposed **[model of positive
conditionality]{.underline}** **[offers new possibilities]{.underline}**
**[not only for incenting]{.underline}** **[partners]{.underline}**
**[to take steps toward]{.underline}** shared
**[objectives]{.underline}** **[but also for improving
planning]{.underline}** **[and management]{.underline}**
**[of]{.underline}** security sector **[assistance]{.underline}**
**[resources]{.underline}**. Assistance programs are structured such
that the achievement of each milestone triggers an expansion of the
assistance relationship. **[Each step also provides]{.underline}** **[an
opportunity]{.underline}** **[for an assessment]{.underline}** of goals
and progress**[. It enables planners to incorporate natural
mechanisms]{.underline}** **[to provide]{.underline}** **[exit
ramps]{.underline}**, through which the U.S. or partner government can
determine to terminate the initiative, or to restructure efforts to
achieve a defined milestone. To be effective, it is critical that
overarching objectives, as well as milestones leading toward those
objectives, are specific, measurable, and time bound.

### Solvency\-\--Inducements\-\--Theory

#### Inducements [work]{.underline} and [spillover]{.underline} to create [self-reinforcing cycles]{.underline} of cooperation in other areas.

A. Issue-Linkage Theory

**[The issue-linkage theory of]{.underline}** negative **[sanctions and
positive inducements]{.underline}** presented in Chapter 3 is **[based
on a number of]{.underline}** fundamental **[assumptions about
counter-proliferation]{.underline}** **[diplomacy]{.underline}**,
**[and]{.underline}** indeed **[any attempt to influence the behavior of
another state]{.underline}**:

First, **[both sanctions]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}**
**[inducements]{.underline}** **[are]{.underline}** bargaining
**[strategies]{.underline}**, **[and the strategic]{.underline}**
bargaining **[metaphor is an appropriate way to
conceptualize]{.underline}** **[their use]{.underline}**.
**[States]{.underline}** **[choose their policies]{.underline}**
according **[how they anticipate the other state will
respond]{.underline}**.

Second, sanctions and **[inducements are best understood as forms of
issue linkage]{.underline}**, **[in which cooperation]{.underline}** in
one issue area **[is conditioned upon cooperation in
another.]{.underline}**

Third, states\' preferences are central to understanding the bargaining
process and outcomes. The value both states assign to the nuclear issue,
their willingness to use extortion, and the value they assign to
specific threats and promises are all important.

Fourth, states bargain under conditions of incomplete information.
States must form beliefs about one another\'s preferences, and in turn
form expectations about one another\'s reactions, in order to choose
their own policies. These beliefs are built on the availability of
intelligence, observations of past behavior, biases, and the nature of
the relationship between the two states. States can more easily
cooperate when they can accurately screen one another\'s preferences,
and signal their own. States also have incomplete information about the
gains that are possible from cooperation or defection. This is
particularly the case with nuclear proliferation, as the consequences of
developing nuclear weapons is both uncertain and carries substantial
risk.

Fifth, bargaining is sequential. The sequential nature of bargaining
introduces distributional and reputational barriers to cooperation, as
states are typically willing to incur significant costs to avoid a
reputation as an easy target for extortion, or to avoid conferring a
strategic advantage to an adversary that could be exploited for
significant gain in the future. However, sequential bargaining,
paradoxically, reduces incentives for bluffing, endows \"cheap talk\"
diplomacy with real influence, and allows states to change one
another\'s preferences and beliefs in ways that make cooperation more
likely.

Sixth, domestic politics is important. States\' preferences are
powerfully shaped by the external security context, but are ultimately
determined by the particular preferences and beliefs of domestic actors,
and the domestic political balance of power. Domestic political effects
can be significant even when states are insecure if there is substantial
uncertainty and there are divisions among influential elites over which
policies are best. This is typically the case with nuclear
proliferation. The security implications of nuclear weapons development
are highly uncertain. The nuclear weapons issue is frequently
contentious among elites, and is naturally linked to preferences
regarding the state\'s economic and political orientation, the prestige
of the regime, as well as nationalism. Both sanctions and inducements
can be targeted in ways that successfully exploit these factors.

Building on these assumptions, I have presented an issue-linkage theory
of nuclear counter-proliferation from which several general predictions
about the effectiveness of positive inducements and negative sanctions
can be deduced.

\- First, **[positive inducements are more likely to be effective
than]{.underline}** negative **[sanctions]{.underline}**. **[The sender
can typically draw on a wider set of resources to offer inducements than
it can with sanctions]{.underline}**. **[Sanctions are]{.underline}**
also **[more likely than inducements to exacerbate distributional and
reputational problems]{.underline}**. **[Inducements]{.underline}** also
**[have fewer enforcement problems]{.underline}**, **[as they can be
withdrawn in the event of noncompliance]{.underline}**.

\- Second, the relatively superior effectiveness of inducements is much
greater with adversaries than it is with allies. Inducements are a
promising tool of international influence with adversaries, while
sanctions are not. Moreover, **[sanctions are not only likely to
fail]{.underline}**, **[but]{.underline}** can **[make a bad situation
worse by]{.underline}** **[triggering an escalatory spiral
and]{.underline}** wider **[conflict]{.underline}**. The difference in
utility between sanctions and inducements is wider with adversaries than
it is with allies because informational, distributional, and
reputational barriers to cooperation are all substantially higher. At
the same time, with adversaries, the sender enjoys far fewer resources
to draw from to issue meaningful threats.

Adversaries know less about one another, are more mistrustful, have
higher expectations that they will be exploited, are more concerned with
relative gains, and are more concerned about their reputation as a tough
bargainer. They also typically have already taken measures to protect
themselves from one another\'s influence attempts. All of this makes
sanctions must less likely to be effective. However, there is
substantially less of a problem with these negative effects when using
positive inducements, as inducements either do not involve, or are more
capable of mitigating, many of these same barriers to agreement.
Finally, because adversaries lack existing cooperative arrangements, the
sender often has only two options for threats: military force and
multilateral economic sanctions. The policy options for inducements -
better relations, security assurances, enhanced trade, technology
transfers - tend to be more diverse and more flexible.

-Third, **[withholding diplomatic talks as a bargaining tactic is
counterproductive]{.underline}**. **[There is real value to private
diplomacy]{.underline}**. **[States are much less likely to bluff or try
to exploit one another than is]{.underline}** typically
**[believed]{.underline}**, **[and]{.underline}** successful bluffs
**[are difficult to achieve with]{.underline}** 367
**[adversaries]{.underline}**. **[Private diplomacy represents an
important channel of communication]{.underline}** between states **[in
which]{.underline}** policy **[preferences can be coordinated
and]{.underline}** private **[information revealed]{.underline}**.
**[Miscommunication]{.underline}** **[and disagreement are more
likely]{.underline}** when these lines are severed.

\- Fourth, **[cooperation]{.underline}** and conflict can **[lead to
self-reinforcing spirals]{.underline}**. **[Cooperation in one area
leads to reputational gains that make cooperation in other areas more
likely.]{.underline}** Similarly, **[smaller]{.underline}** or even
symbolic **[agreements can serve as powerful signals]{.underline}**
**[that can improve]{.underline}** the chances of **[future
cooperation]{.underline}**. Incremental agreement is therefore more
likely to succeed than attempts to craft all-at-once deals or set
ultimatums for compliance with costly and inflexible demands.

**[There is a well-developed area of research on the use
of]{.underline}** **[side payments]{.underline}** (of which issue
linkage is a part) **[in the bargaining literature]{.underline}**.
**[According to bargaining]{.underline}** **[theories]{.underline}**,
**[policymakers use]{.underline}** side **[payments as either
direct]{.underline}** monetary **[payments]{.underline}** (such as
bribes) **[or material concessions on other issues]{.underline}** (such
as issue linages) **[to encourage concessions]{.underline}** on a given
issue.42 **[Side payments and issue linkages]{.underline}**, **[if used
to provide a positive inducement]{.underline}**, **[help states to
diminish conflict and to reach an]{.underline}** otherwise
**[unattainable level of cooperation during
negotiations]{.underline}**.43 Issue linkages, as a part of side payment
mechanism, help states to solve distribution problems, arise when actors
have different preferences over alternative possible agreements, in
bargaining situations. As Morrow observed: "a linkage deal requires two
issues that the sides believe are of different importance. Each side
receives concessions on the issue it believes is of greater relative
importance. . . \[if\] done properly, both sides prefer the linkage deal
to going to war over the initial issue." 44

**[A state may offer various types of incentives to
encourage]{.underline}** otherwise **[unwilling governments to
cooperate]{.underline}** with it. **[Side payments]{.underline}** may
**[come in the form of]{.underline}** **[direct payments]{.underline}**
such as cash payments (or grants), **[loans]{.underline}**, **[or
military aid,]{.underline}** etc. **[Positive incentives
can]{.underline}** also **[be in the form of indirect
payments]{.underline}**, **[such as]{.underline}**
**[unilateral]{.underline}** trade **[concessions]{.underline}**,
**[investments]{.underline}**, etc. In an alliance negotiation the
nature and volume of side payments, however, will depend on the
strategic value of the alliance to the more powerful side.45I contend
that side payments serve as a compensation mechanism that closes the
deficit in net gains sometimes felt by a member (usually, the weaker
side) of the alliance. **[Side payments]{.underline}** sometimes
**[increase the scope of the alliance to include economic]{.underline}**
and/or **[military dimensions]{.underline}**. For a great power
considering an alliance with a small state, the strategic value of the
alliance may justify the cost of side payments; for the small state
gains involve both economic and strategic dimensions at the expense of
concessions on issues deemed important to the great power.46 This study
probes the conditions under which side payments are used as a bargaining
tool in asymmetric alliances.

Conclusions Regarding Inducements

**[Inducements]{.underline}** of any type **[are neither necessary nor
sufficient for success]{.underline}**. **[Neither limited]{.underline}**
nonmilitary **[rewards nor full-scale]{.underline}** military
**[reassurance]{.underline}** **[led to success in the
Taiwan]{.underline}** and South Korean **[cases]{.underline}**. **[The
provision of]{.underline}** limited military
**[reassurance]{.underline}** likewise **[failed to lead to
success]{.underline}** in Pakistan and Israel. As noted, it remains to
be investigated if massive military reassurance can stop low-dependence
allies.

The U.S. offered full military reassurance to **[South
Korea]{.underline}** by promising to defend it with nuclear weapons. To
**[Taiwan]{.underline}**, the U.S. only offered limited non-military
rewards, such as renewal of licenses for Taipei's civilian nuclear power
reactors. **[From these two]{.underline}** complete success
**[cases]{.underline}**, **[the conclusion can be drawn that inducements
do not play as significant a role]{.underline}** **[for highly-dependent
allies as the scholarship on incentives leads us to
expect]{.underline}**. The logic of the literature suggests that
provision of military reassurance, rather than non-military rewards,
should increase the chances of success because such inducements are more
likely to undercut the ally's insecurity that impelled it to pursue the
NWP. In other words, **[the incentives that satisfy an ally's current
and future]{.underline}** security **[needs are more likely to persuade
it to abandon the future gains it hopes to enjoy]{.underline}** if it
persists and is ultimately successful in making its nuclear weapons
program operational. However, inducements did not play significant roles
in either Taiwan or South Korea. Taiwan was forced into submission when
it was offered minimal non-military rewards. Having politically
abandoned Taipei, the U.S. made little effort to reassure it of its
future intentions; furthermore, having promised non-military rewards,
Washington provided them inconsistently.14 The Taiwan case thus suggests
that in the cases of the most acute dependence by an ally, the U.S. can
economize on incentives and achieve success primarily by coercive
denial.

The **[South Korean case is unique in that the U.S. made]{.underline}**
two **[public]{.underline}**, high-level **[pledges to defend it
with]{.underline}** **[nuc]{.underline}**lear weapon**[s]{.underline}**.
**[Both of these features]{.underline}** (public and high-level) **[made
the pledges]{.underline}** highly **[credible because the U.S. was
issuing a direct warning]{.underline}** to the Soviets and the North
Koreans **[about the consequences]{.underline}** **[of an attack on
South Korea]{.underline}**. As noted previously, the strength of this
military reassurance becomes clear once we compare it to the U.S.
approach to the ArabIsraeli conflict. In that case, President Kennedy
made a diplomatically "balanced" statement, speaking for the security
interests of both parties, which, as could be expected, failed to
reassure the Israelis.

The failure of these public and high-level military guarantees to change
the South Koreans' minds was surprising. Military reassurance did not
work because in 1978 Seoul still engaged in negotiations with France
about purchasing the reprocessing facility. President Carter's coercion
by export controls was necessary to stop this renewed attempt in its
tracks. Donald Gregg\'s account helpfully illustrates this point by
describing the failure of an earlier reassurance attempt: \"The visit to
Seoul of President Ford and Henry Kissinger, in the fall of 1974, en
route to a meeting with the Soviet leadership in Vladivostok, was very
reassuring to Park, and the relationship was stabilized. The nuclear
program was stopped later on, when South Korea had to go abroad to
purchase items that it could not produce itself \[thus making itself
vulnerable to coercion by export controls\]\" (Gregg 2013, emphasis
added). In sum, South Korea was the only case in which the U.S.
explicitly pledged to strengthen its deterrent for an ally, and this
military reassurance failed alone to bring about a nuclear change of
heart in Seoul.

**[For Pakistan and Israel]{.underline}**, **[Washington chose to
provide only limited]{.underline}** military
**[reassurance]{.underline}** (selected **[military aid)]{.underline}**
**[to strengthen their defensive capabilities]{.underline}**,
**[and]{.underline}** equally **[unequivocally refused to provide
anything approaching a deterrent capability]{.underline}** that both
states repeatedly requested. **[The U.S. knew that the arms it offered
to Pakistan would not even allow it to balance]{.underline}**---**[let
alone, deter]{.underline}**---**[India]{.underline}**.15 The Israeli
case also shows that the Kennedy Administration drew a clear line
between a defensive buildup to bring Jerusalem to the point of parity
with its Arab adversaries and massive military aid that Israel requested
that could have allowed Israel to deter its enemies.

[Europeans know]{.mark} that\'s true, [they\'re **unlikely** to

POLITICS OF 2 PERCENT: NATO and the Security Vacuum in Europe",

And [so the dilemma remains: [Europeans are]{.mark} still
[dependent]{.mark}]{.underline} on U.S. services for their security,
[[and]{.mark} they are **[not]{.mark} too [bothered]{.mark}** by that
fact]{.underline}. At the same time, [Americans eagerly want Europeans
to do more but **can't really sanction them** in any **painful
way**]{.underline} because, in the end, Europe is too strategically
important for the United States to abandon it and leave its defense to
the Europeans alone. Meanwhile, [the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [feels the need to demonstrate]{.underline} to
both Europeans and external powers that [it **stands by** its **security
[commitments]{.mark}**]{.underline} to Europe and that it is ready to
show strength when needed. [This [could]{.mark}]{.underline} well
[**[undermine]{.mark}** the **strong American [push]{.mark}**
[for]{.mark} Europeans to adopt the [2 percent]{.mark} metric. [It could
make the target less realistic by creating]{.mark} a **[false]{.mark}
sense of [security]{.mark}**]{.underline} among Europeans [[that serves
as an **incentive against**]{.underline}]{.mark}, not for, more
**[European [defense spending]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In the absence of
any political will from the Europeans to significantly beef up their
defense, this impasse can basically only be broken in one of two ways:
Either the United States is completely honest about its role in Europe
and says it will continue to subsidize the continent's security. This
will probably mean an expensive, permanent recommitment to Europe over
the next decade or so. Or the United States reduces its commitment,
thereby risking a security crisis in Europe and the erosion of the
cornerstones of its global posture. [Neither of these two radical
solutions will be embraced]{.underline}, of course. Instead, [a third
option will likely **continue** for some time: [balancing]{.mark} the
two and hoping that a blend of demonstrated American [**solidarity**,
**lecturing**, and **threats**]{.mark} of leaving will move the
Europeans in the desired direction]{.underline}. This will be a shaky
compromise. It can only last as long as NATO and the territory protected
by Article 5 of the NATO treaty are not really threatened by anyone, and
as long as the political consensus in Washington survives that says
Europe, America's geostrategic countercoast, must be always defended by
the United States. Should the strategic situation in Europe change
dramatically, or should America's support for Europe erode, as some say
it inevitably will, [the status quo [will become]{.mark}
**[unsustainable]{.mark}**]{.underline}. No one knows how long it will
take to reach that point.

#### Loss is [more persuasive than gain]{.underline} for states [and]{.underline} sub-state actors

**[Berejikian & Early 13]{.underline}**, \*PhD, Professor at the
University of Georgia, Associate Professor in the Department of
International Affairs \*\*PhD, Associate Professor of Political Science,
Associate Dean for Research at the University at Albany, SUNY\'s
Rockefeller College (Jeffrey Berejikian; Bryan Early, 2013, "Loss
Aversion and Foreign Policy Resolve," *Political Psychology*, 34.5)

[Loss aversion is]{.underline} perhaps [the most enduring and intuitive
finding in behavioral decision theory]{.underline} (Kahneman et al.,
1991; Novemsky & Kahneman, 2005; Thaler, 1980). [Experimental results
suggest]{.underline} that the subjective [[**pain of loss** is
**greater** than]{.mark} the [benefit]{.mark} enjoyed [from]{.mark} an
equivalent [gain]{.mark}, and scholars have extended this finding beyond
the laboratory to explain a wide range of otherwise
puzzling]{.underline} human [behavior. Building upon these
results]{.underline}, and adding new findings from the field of
neuroscience, [we]{.underline} seek to [contribute to the
theory]{.underline}-building enterprise [in]{.underline} the study of
[foreign policy]{.underline} by constructing a gener- alizable theory of
loss aversion and foreign policy behavior. The approach is consistent
with the call to continue to develop theories of foreign policy built
upon solid micro foundations (Hudson, 2005). Specifically, we hope to
explain why policy makers stubbornly stand firm in their prosecution of
some international disputes while in others they are willing to back
down. [[The question is relevant for]{.mark} any number of foreign
policy issues, such as]{.underline} territorial disputes, trade
negotiations, conflicts over water rights, arms control, and
**[international treaty [compliance]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Much of the
research on loss aversion in the foreign policy literature has relied
heavily upon case studies (Mercer, 2005). However, for some time
scholars have suggested that loss aversion should produce broad patterns
of behavior that could, in principle, be captured by statistical
analysis (e.g., Jervis, 1992, Levy, 1996). [Large-n analyses of broader
behavior patterns]{.underline} thus remain fertile territory for
research and contain the potential for [advanc]{.underline}ing [our
understanding of how loss aversion affects foreign policy]{.underline}.
As we demonstrate in this article, foreign policy behaviors, like trade
disputes, can be analyzed using contemporary insights about loss
aversion derived from neuroscience. Our analysis proceeds in the
following manner. First, we build upon neuroscience research to argue
that policy makers\' aversion to accepting losses can affect their
willingness to back down in international disputes. [[Cognitive
science]{.mark} has [convincingly demonstrated]{.mark} that
[individuals]{.mark} tend to **[strive harder]{.mark}**]{.underline} and
take more risks [**[to avoid losses]{.mark}** than they will to achieve
similar gains]{.underline}. More recent [neuroscientific findings show
that [unrealized expectations]{.mark}, like]{.underline} those observed
[[**in a broken agreement**, are processed]{.underline}]{.mark} in the
human mind [in a way almost [identical to]{.mark} actual
[losses]{.mark}]{.underline}. The result is that unmet expectations can
also trigger loss aversion. Policy makers\' resolve during disputes can
thus vary if they perceive themselves to be defending previously
established agreements from violations by their counterparts. Such
violations diminish expected and hoped for gains, triggering loss
aversion. Generalizing from this phenomenon, we then distinguish between
preventive goals in which policy makers seek to protect against
perceived losses versus promotive goals in which policy makers seek to
make new gains. We theorize that policy makers should be less willing to
back down in disputes initiated for preventive reasons than for
promotive ones. We employ our theory to help explain cross-case
variation in the level of resolve demonstrated by the U.S. Trade
Representative (USTR) in prosecuting Section 301 trade disputes designed
to improve the terms of trade for U.S. businesses. Drawing on our
preventive versus promotive framework, we hypothesize that the USTR
should be less willing to back down in Section 301 disputes initiated
because of breached trade agreements than those initiated to open up new
markets. We test our theory via [two]{.underline} different [large-n
analyses]{.underline} of a hundred Section 301 trade disputes. This
approach is unique because - to the best of our knowledge - this study
constitutes the first theoretically driven statistical analysis of loss
aversion on foreign policy behavior grounded in a specific set of
neuroscientific findings. In our first test, we conduct an analysis
using binary logit, and, in the second, we employ a competing risks
model. The two approaches allow us to model the effects of time on U.S.
resolve in different ways. Our empirical results provide strong support
for our theory, revealing that the U.S. Government was significantly
less likely to back down in preventive disputes. Indeed, we find that
the preventive/promotive distinction provides the single greatest
determinant of U.S. resolve in prosecuting its Section 301 cases. We
believe that this project offers a number of novel contributions. First,
this study [demonstrate]{.underline}s [that [specific findings]{.mark}
from cognitive neuroscience can [make tangible contributions
to]{.mark}]{.underline} explaining phenomena in
**[[i]{.underline}]{.mark}**nternational
**[[r]{.underline}]{.mark}**elations. Our study reveals that [loss
aversion]{.underline} and unrealized expecta- tions [profoundly shape
the behavior of even the most powerful states in the international
system]{.underline} and that it does so in ways that traditional
theoretical approaches are often blind to. This suggests that [the
loss-aversion-based framework]{.underline} we have developed
[may]{.underline} be able to [yield novel insights]{.underline} into a
host of other issue areas beyond the study of trade policy. Second, we
test our arguments utilizing [large-n]{.underline} statistical
analysis - a method that has seen little use in evaluating cognitive
and/or neuroscience theories of international relations (e.g., Drury,
2005). Moving forward with a program of [quantitative analysis broadens
the applicability of such theories]{.underline} and places them on equal
analytical footing with rationalist models. [Our project thus
demonstrates that the empirical barriers that have to date \"arrested\"
the development of the cognitive research agenda in international
relations can be overcome]{.underline} (Walker, 2007). Lastly, our
inquiry provides a number of case-specific insights explaining the
comparative resolve demonstrated by the United States in prosecuting its
Section 301 trade disputes and the policy implications that arise from
them.

Security Assistance as Incentive **[Security assistance generates a
classic principal-agent problem.]{.underline}** In such relationships
between a principal and its agent or proxy, **[there exists an
information asymmetry where the agent inherently has more information
about their own capabilities, activities, and interests than the
principal]{.underline}**. **[Agents, being rational actors, place their
own interests above those of the principal and, in the absence of other
incentives, behave accordingly. The greater the degree of misalignment,
the more problematic this becomes]{.underline}**. U.S. frustration
during its 20-year war in Afghanistan over Pakistan's perceived failure
to adequately confront extremist groups, despite significant military
aid, is an example of principal-agent problems at work. Fortunately,
these are not insurmountable obstacles. Security assistance in the form
of arms, equipment, or other support can be an effective incentive when
it is used as a carrot to reward desired behavior, such as achieving a
specific reform or taking some other action aligned with the interests
of the principal. Alternately, such aid becomes a stick when it is
withheld. An example of this carrot-and-stick approach being used
effectively is described in Walter Ladwig's study of U.S. assistance to
the Philippines to combat the Hukbalahap rebellion in the decade
following World War II. Heavy-handed tactics used by the local
constabulary forces were a major factor driving support for the rebels.
Recognizing this problem, U.S. advisors insisted on a series of reforms
within the security forces as a precondition for further aid. These
measures, along with the appointment of the reform-minded Ramon
Magsaysay as defense chief, contributed to a far more effective
counterinsurgency campaign and the eventual defeat of the rebel
movement. This approach of using aid as an incentive stands in sharp
contrast to Ladwig's other case study, Vietnam, where U.S. aid was used
as an inducement in the hope that it would eventually change partner
behavior. In this case, U.S. advisors tried in vain year after year to
cajole prime minister Ngo Dinh Diem and successor regimes to implement
reforms that would have broadened domestic political support and made
the South Vietnamese forces more effective. All the while, massive U.S.
assistance continued to flow in with the expectation that it would
eventually bring about a change of heart in the host-nation government.
Such change never came, and the United States and its South Vietnamese
proxies lost the war. The more recent U.S. experience in Iraq from 2003
until the withdrawal in 2011 contains echoes of Vietnam. David Lake's
study of that conflict suggests that provision of unconditional security
assistance may still be America's default setting. Despite massive
volumes of military aid provided to the Iraqi government during this
period, U.S. urging to reform the security forces and national
government repeatedly failed. Nouri al-Maliki, prime minister during
much of this period, resisted efforts to make the armed forces more
broadly inclusive and apolitical, instead continuing to employ them as
his own sectarian instrument. Again, the United States used an approach
focused on training and equipping, known in the current lexicon as
building partner capacity. The Iraqi government received assistance
regardless of its effort, or lack thereof, to implement much-needed
reform while the United States failed to use the leverage which hundreds
of millions of dollars of assistance could buy. Several years later, the
Iraqi military in which the United States had invested so much fell
apart virtually upon first contact with the Islamic State's irregular
militia. **[The "building partner capacity" approach has two main flaws.
First, it ignores fundamental problems, such as corruption,
coup-proofing, and otherwise weak defense institutions which additional
military capacity cannot overcome and may even
exacerbate]{.underline}**. Paradoxically, **[a focus primarily on
capacity-building often fails to build meaningful, long-term capacity
because it neglects underlying institutional problems.]{.underline}**
Second, **[it ignores principal-agent problems by assuming that once in
possession of highly capable security forces, the partner will wield
them in a manner aligned with U.S. interests]{.underline}**. **[U.S.
advisors and diplomats may recognize the pressing need for security
sector reform in the partner. Unfortunately, the ingrained culture of
U.S. security assistance seemingly relies on the false premise that with
enough U.S. training and relationship-building, other countries'
militaries will voluntarily reform even though it is often not in their
personal interests to do so]{.underline}**.

Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. However, these studies lack a
well-defined formula for what constitutes adequate capability and say
little about what adjustments the United States and NATO must make to
strengthen NATO's deterrence posture in the Baltics and Poland.

To help clarify capability requirements in the region, we reviewed
conventional deterrence theories and models from the Cold War. Though
long-standing, this research provides a clearer picture of the ideal
defensive force posture and adequate force ratios needed to improve
deterrence, compared to recent policy analyses. Focusing on land-based
operations, we then applied these correlation of forces models to
analyze the current balance of conventional ground forces in the
Baltics. Through **[comparing]{.underline}** **[the relative combat

VILNIUS, Lithuania --- **[For the Baltic states]{.underline}**, **[the
desire for steadier]{.underline}** and more **[robust American
presence]{.underline}** **[to deter Russia is high.]{.underline}**

Ever since Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, NATO and the U.S. military
have drastically bolstered their presence in Eastern Europe to include
deploying NATO rapid response forces, embedding units under the command
of Baltic states' forces, building up arsenals of equipment, deploying a
heel-to-toe rotational U.S. armored brigade combat team and conducting
increasingly complex exercises.

The deployment of the enhanced forward presence, or EFP, battalions in
Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, for instance, have significantly reduced
the risk of military conflict in the Baltic region, Lithuanian Defence
Minister Raimundas Karoblis recently told Defense News and a group on an
Atlantic Council-organized, fact-finding mission in Lithuania.

"On the other hand, **[let me be very clear]{.underline}**: \[**[The\]
U.S. is the]{.underline}** **[most powerful ally]{.underline}** **[and
its deterrent effect]{.underline}** **[is not comparable]{.underline}**
**[to other allies]{.underline}**," he told Defense News in a statement.
"**[I am convinced]{.underline}** **[that]{.underline}** **[Russia would
not dare to test]{.underline}** **[NATO if U.S. military
units]{.underline}** **[are deployed]{.underline}** **[on]{.underline}**
\[a\] **[persistent basis]{.underline}** **[in the three Baltic
states]{.underline}**."

Karoblis suggested **[even a rather small]{.underline}** U.S.
**[military presence]{.underline}** **[like]{.underline}**
**[short-range]{.underline}** air **[defense units]{.underline}** or an
Army company in addition to each EFP battalion "**[would]{.underline}**
**[significantly boost NATO's deterrence]{.underline}**."

The desire for a stronger American presence doesn't just stem from
Lithuania's Ministry of Defence; it's also preferred by top military
leaders of the country's Iron Wolf Brigade and the German-led NATO EFP
unit.

Keeping the Russian bear at bay

Lithuania, in a tenuous position bordering Belarus and Kaliningrad, has
dramatically ramped up its military capability since Russia's move on
Crimea. Lithuania is joined to Poland by a short 40-mile border --- the
Suwalki Gap --- that separates Belarus from Kaliningrad. Should Russian
forces close the gap, it would isolate Lithuania and its northern Baltic
state neighbors from the rest of Europe.

The country hasn't sat idly by, waiting for Europe or America to help;
it has taken steps to modernize its military by buying new infantry
fighting vehicles, tactical vehicles, howitzers and medium-range air
defense systems, and it's grown its ranks by adding another brigade and
reinstating conscription.

Lithuania also met the NATO pledge to spend 2 percent of its gross
domestic product on defense in 2018, and it's planning to increase that
effort to 2.5 percent by 2030.

**[But despite Lithuania's]{.underline}** military
**[buildup]{.underline}** and its Eastern European neighbors' moves to
strengthen defense of the eastern front, **[Russia continues to build
up]{.underline}** **[its]{.underline}** military **[might in the Western
Military District]{.underline}**, **[increase cooperation]{.underline}**
**[in]{.underline}** military **[exercises]{.underline}** **[with
Belarus]{.underline}**, **[and]{.underline}** **[militarize
Kaliningrad]{.underline}** with missiles and tanks, all to make Russia
capable of succeeding in a regional conflict.

Then there are the allegations of Russia's unconventional operations in
the gray zone of conflict aimed at fracturing NATO and Europe by
tampering with elections, engaging in cyberattacks and attempting to
influence populations through false narratives in social media.

**[The U.S. Army]{.underline}** **[is using heel-to-toe]{.underline}**
rotational **[deployments]{.underline}** **[of armored]{.underline}**
brigade **[combat teams]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}** **[combat
aviation brigades in Europe]{.underline}** **[to practice
rapidly]{.underline}** **[massing equipment]{.underline}**
**[and]{.underline}** **[troops in countries]{.underline}** **[near the
Russian border.]{.underline}**

When officials in Lithuania were asked what types of American military
units it might want most, they were hesitant to provide specifics but
reiterated the importance of U.S. presence.

The U.S. Army currently deploys 6,000 soldiers throughout seven
countries as part of Atlantic Resolve in three separate rotations ---
armored, aviation and logistical --- according to a U.S. Army Europe
spokeswoman. In Lithuania specifically, the Pennsylvania National Guard,
through the State Partnership Program, has traveled to the country on
more than 275 occasions and conducted over 600 security cooperation
engagements, the spokeswoman told Defense News.

There is also a unit-based partnership between the 2nd Cavalry Regiment
and the Iron Wolf and Griffin brigades.

What would an additional **[US presence]{.underline}** look like?

The U.S. Army regularly holds meetings to ensure it's aligning its
operations with the National Defense Strategy, which includes deployment
strategy, Army Under Secretary Ryan McCarthy told reporters in a recent
interview at the Pentagon.

The NDS squarely places Russia and China as the top two threats to the
United States.

McCarthy said 60 percent of the Army's brigade combat teams are nearing
the highest level of readiness. "Those units could be put in the queue
to go forward and deploy, but it's got to be something where the
\[combatant command\] comes forward and asks for that capability," he
said.

U.S. Army Europe would not tell Defense News possible options for
further deployment in the Baltics, instead referring the inquiry to the
Department of the Army.

What might be provided **[in the Baltics]{.underline}** probably
**[wouldn't be a big rotational brigade]{.underline}**,
**[but]{.underline}** much **[smaller units]{.underline}**, McCarthy
said. "What is encouraging is the dialogue within NATO, as well as
\[U.S. Indo-Pacific Command\], for the desire for expeditionary-like
basing throughout both of those areas of responsibility with investment
coming from host nations," he said.

Poland, for instance, offered to pay \$2 billion for a permanent base
for a U.S. armored division in 2018, and the possibility seems to be
gaining traction, but it is more likely to accommodate a brigade-sized
unit scattered at installations already in existence.

Former U.S. Army Europe commander, retired Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges, who
continues to study European defense as the Pershing chair in strategic
studies at the Center for European Policy Analysis, believes additional
units, albeit small and specialized, should deploy to the Baltics on a
more consistent basis.

**[If the U.S. were to]{.underline}** **[put]{.underline}**
**[additional troops in Latvia]{.underline}**,
**[Lithuania]{.underline}** **[and Estonia]{.underline}**,
**[Hodges]{.underline}** **[told]{.underline}** **[Defense
News]{.underline}** in a recent phone interview **[from his home base
of]{.underline}** **[Frankfurt, Germany]{.underline}**, **[the
units]{.underline}** **[should have capabilities]{.underline}** **[that
fill host-nation gaps]{.underline}**.

"**[I believe that the capabilities]{.underline}** **[that we
need]{.underline}** **[would be logistics, intelligence,
communications]{.underline}**, **[and]{.underline}**, really, air and
**[missile defense]{.underline}**," he said. "In other words, enablers
that take a little bit more time to get established, but which provide
the important networks necessary for rapid reinforcement."

Additionally, **[by deploying key enablers]{.underline}**,
**[many]{.underline}** **[of the units can]{.underline}** come **[from
the]{.underline}** **[Army]{.underline}** National
**[Guard]{.underline}** **[and Army Reserves]{.underline}**
**[because]{.underline}** those **[capabilities are resident in reserve
formations]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}** ideally
**[suited]{.underline}** **[for rotational presence]{.underline}**,
Hodges said.

ASATs in the Global Community

Despite our advantage, **[the U.S. has an interest in
preventing]{.underline}** an **[ASAT arms race]{.underline}**,
**[which]{.underline}** could **[lead to the]{.underline}**
**[prolif]{.underline}**eration **[of ASAT technologies]{.underline}**
**[across the globe]{.underline}** and an increase in ASAT tests.
**[Given the negative impacts]{.underline}** **[of]{.underline}** ASAT
**[tests]{.underline}** on the space environment, **[all countries would
benefit]{.underline}** **[from a treaty]{.underline}** **[establishing a
moratorium]{.underline}** **[on]{.underline}** ASAT
**[testing]{.underline}**. Each ASAT test conducted by a major power is
a signal to smaller, developing space nations that ASAT technology is a
necessary part of being a space power. Developing space powers may seek
to improve their standing in the international community and garner
prestige by conducting high-profile ASAT tests. **[An
international]{.underline}** **[treaty]{.underline}**
**[denouncing]{.underline}** **[ASAT tests]{.underline}**
**[and]{.underline}** **[binding signatories to a]{.underline}** testing
**[moratorium could eliminate these incentives]{.underline}** **[and
prompt]{.underline}** developing **[space powers]{.underline}** **[to
forego ASAT tests]{.underline}**.

**[Such a treaty]{.underline}** could **[help establish
norms]{.underline}** in space, **[an area in which]{.underline}**
**[U.S. leadership has failed]{.underline}**. **[To work
towards]{.underline}** **[the goal of]{.underline}**
**[the]{.underline}** **[O]{.underline}**uter **[S]{.underline}**pace
**[T]{.underline}**reaty **[in establishing space]{.underline}** **[as a
peaceful,]{.underline}** non-militarized **[realm, it must be clear that
ASAT]{.underline}** **[tests are unacceptable]{.underline}**. This would
make ASAT weaponry a less desirable acquisition.

Most roadblocks to international cooperation in this area have been
established by the U.S. The Union of Concerned Scientists explains:

> In 2006, the United States added a provision to its National Space
> Policy opposing the development of any new legal regimes or other
> mechanisms that would restrict U.S. access to or use of space,
> including any arms control proposals that would impinge on military
> space acquisitions or operations. Such categorical rejection of
> international efforts to address space security issues, however, runs
> counter to U.S. interests: by forgoing the possibility of new mutually
> agreed-upon rules or constraints, the United States limits its options
> rather than keeping them open. Without constraints on ASAT weapons,
> for example, threats to satellites will continue to proliferate and
> mature, leading to less predictability and stability in crises and
> forcing the United States to expend more effort in securing
> satellites.23

U.S. policymakers should reconsider the costs and the benefits of
blocking international cooperation on ASAT weaponry.

Satellite Defense

**[Diplomatic agreements]{.underline}** **[can take a long time to take
effect]{.underline}**. In the meantime, **[the U.S. should diminish
vulnerabilities]{.underline}** **[present in its]{.underline}** space
**[systems]{.underline}**. This can be accomplished in several ways:

**[Increase System Redundancy]{.underline}**

**[Smaller satellite sizes]{.underline}** **[and reduced]{.underline}**
launch **[costs have made it]{.underline}** **[cheaper]{.underline}**
**[than]{.underline}** **[ever to put satellites into

utilize these]{.underline}** favorable **[conditions]{.underline}**
**[to ensure satellite]{.underline}** system**[s]{.underline}**
**[enjoy]{.underline}** sufficient **[redundancy]{.underline}**.
Planners should examine systems and ask the following questions:

• How many satellites would need to become inoperable for this system to
malfunction?

• What impacts would users on Earth experience if this system lost one
satellite? Two? Three? Four?

If the answers to these questions prove less than desirable, system
planners should consider adding satellites to the system to increase its
damage tolerance.

**[Planners should not limit]{.underline}** **[their scope to
satellites]{.underline}** alone. **[Ground stations]{.underline}**
**[and]{.underline}** the **[corresponding abilities]{.underline}**
**[to communicate]{.underline}** **[and control]{.underline}** satellite

**[Hardening]{.underline}** these satellites **[would increase the
likelihood]{.underline}** **[of]{.underline}** their
**[survival]{.underline}**.

To harden GEO satellites against the threat of a high-altitude nuclear
detonation, **[the components]{.underline}** of strategic or sensitive
satellites **[should be housed in a]{.underline}** **[radiation-safe
vault]{.underline}**. To guard against the threat of an EMP,
**[satellites]{.underline}** **[could be equipped]{.underline}** **[with
a nuclear]{.underline}** event **[sensor that would turn the satellite
off]{.underline}** and then on once the EMP threat had passed. A variety
of safeguards exist at relatively low costs (5-15% of total cost) to
guard against serious damage.26

**[Establishing "Do-Not-Orbit" Zones]{.underline}**

**[Space is a crowded space]{.underline}**. Still, **[our strategic
satellites]{.underline}** **[should be given]{.underline}** their
**[space]{.underline}**. **[The]{.underline}** **[U.S.

### Solvency\-\--ASW

systems to track and destroy submarines." Defense News. 4-10-2020.

//EM

Anti-submarine warfare, or **[ASW]{.underline}**, **[is one of a
navy's]{.underline}** **[most difficult]{.underline}**
**[missions]{.underline}**. **[Sonars detect submarines]{.underline}**
**[with only a fraction of the range]{.underline}** and precision
**[possible using radars]{.underline}** or **[visual
sensors]{.underline}** **[against ships above the water]{.underline}**.
Submarines can carry missiles able to hit targets hundreds of miles
away, requiring searches to cover potentially vast areas. And the
torpedoes that aircraft and surface ships use to sink submarines need to
be dropped right on the submarine to have any chance of sinking it.

These challenges led the Cold War-era U.S. Navy to rely on a sequential
approach for tracking enemy submarines. Electronic or visual
intelligence sources would report when an opposing sub was leaving port,
and it would hopefully get picked up by sound surveillance, or SOSUS ---
sonar arrays on the sea floor --- as it entered chokepoints, like that
between Iceland and the United Kingdom.

Patrol aircraft would then attempt to track the submarine using
sonar-equipped buoys, or sonobuoys, and eventually turn it over to a
U.S. nuclear attack submarine, or SSN, for long-term trail.

The U.S. ASW model broke down, however, in the decades following the
Cold War as U.S. submarine and patrol aircraft fleets shrank, the
Chinese submarine fleet grew, and Russian submarines became quieter.
Today, the U.S. Navy devotes enormous effort to tracking each modern
Russian submarine in the western Atlantic.

During the 2000s, the strategy of full-spectrum ASW started an essential
shift in goals, from being able to sink submarines when needed to being
able to defeat submarines by preventing them from accomplishing their
mission.

Full-spectrum ASW and other current concepts, however, still rely on
aircraft, ships and submarines for sensing, tracking and attacking enemy
submarines to bottle them up near their own coasts or sink them in the
open ocean. Although SOSUS has improved since the Cold War and is joined
by a family of new deployable seabed arrays, the next link in the U.S.
ASW chain is still a P-8A Poseidon patrol aircraft, an Arleigh
Burke-class guided-missile destroyer, or a U.S. SSN. These platforms are
in short supply around the world, cost hundreds of millions to billions
of dollars to buy and cost hundreds of thousands of dollars a day to
operate.

**[With defense]{.underline}** **[budgets flattening]{.underline}** and
likely to decrease **[in a post-COVID]{.underline}**-19 **[environment,
the U.S. Navy]{.underline}** **[cannot afford]{.underline}**
**[to]{.underline}** continue **[playing "little kid soccer" in
ASW]{.underline}**, **[with]{.underline}** multiple **[aircraft or
ships]{.underline}** **[converging]{.underline}** **[to
track]{.underline}** and destroy **[submarines]{.underline}** **[before
they can get within missile range of targets]{.underline}** like
aircraft carriers or bases ashore.

**[The Navy]{.underline}** **[should]{.underline}** instead **[increase
the use of unmanned systems in ASW]{.underline}** **[across the
board]{.underline}**, which cost a fraction to buy and operate compared
to their manned counterparts. **[Unmanned aircraft]{.underline}**
**[could]{.underline}** **[deploy sonobuoys]{.underline}**
**[or]{.underline}** stationary **[sonar arrays]{.underline}**,
**[and]{.underline}** **[unmanned undersea]{.underline}** **[or surface
vehicles]{.underline}** **[could tow passive sonar
arrays]{.underline}**. **[Unmanned]{.underline}** surface
**[vehicles]{.underline}** **[could]{.underline}** also **[deploy
low-frequency]{.underline}** active **[sonars like those
carried]{.underline}** **[by U.S. undersea]{.underline}**
**[surveillance]{.underline}** **[ships]{.underline}** that can detect
or drive off submarines from dozens of miles away.

Although autonomous platforms will not have the onboard operators of a
destroyer or patrol aircraft, improved processing is enabling small
autonomous sensors to rapidly identify contacts of interest.
Line-of-sight or satellite communications can connect unmanned vehicles
and sensors with operators ashore or on manned ASW platforms.

A significant shortfall of today's ASW concepts is "closing the kill
chain" by attacking enemy submarines. Air- or surface-launched weapons
have short ranges and small warheads that reduce their ability to sink a
submarine, but their cost and size prevents them from being purchased
and fielded in large numbers.

Unmanned systems could address this shortfall in concert with a new
approach to ASW that suppresses enemy submarines rather than destroying
them. During World War II and the Cold War, allied navies largely kept
submarines at bay through aggressive tracking and harassing attacks, or
by forcing opposing SSNs to protect ballistic missile submarines.

The modern version of submarine suppression would include overt sensing
operations combined with frequent torpedo or depth-bomb attacks.
Although unmanned vehicles frequently launch lethal weapons today under
human supervision, the small weapons that would be most useful for
submarine suppression could be carried in operationally relevant numbers
by medium-altitude, long-endurance UAVs or medium unmanned surface
vessels. Moreover, the large number and long endurance of unmanned
vehicles would enable the tracking and suppressing of many submarines
over a wide area at lower risk than using patrol aircraft or destroyers.

**[Today the U.S. Navy]{.underline}** **[uses unmanned systems in
ASW]{.underline}** primarily **[to detect submarines]{.underline}**.
**[To]{.underline}** affordably **[conduct peacetime
surveillance]{.underline}** **[and effectively defeat submarines in
wartime]{.underline}**, **[the Navy should increase the]{.underline}**
**[role of unmanned systems]{.underline}**. Using manned platforms to
conduct command and control, and unmanned vehicles to track, deter and
engage submarines, could significantly reduce the costs of ASW
operations and enable the Navy to scale its ASW efforts to match the
growing threat posed by submarine fleets.

contribute]{.underline}, [providing]{.underline} approximately **[90
percent of the military assistance]{.underline}** received by Ukraine.
But this hasn't been without hurdles. The Trump-Ukraine scandal, which
saw the president block US military assistance to Ukraine and ultimately
face impeachment proceedings, shocked the global community. 

[While Ukraine has received lethal]{.underline} [and non-lethal
equipment]{.underline} worth more than USD 1.5 billion since Crimea's
annexation, [this has been insufficient in deterring Russian
aggression]{.underline}. **[Counter-battery radar systems]{.underline}**

fatalities [but Ukrainian armed forces are]{.underline} [struggling to

2018, Russia attacked Ukrainian military and seized three Ukrainian
naval vessels at the Kerch Strait -- a passage connecting the Black Sea
with the much smaller, land-locked Azov Sea. The incident led to massive
economic loss for Ukraine, which depends on maritime access, and has had
a significant economic impact for Western trade partners.

Arctic Threats and Opportunities

**[The key threats to U.S. interests]{.underline}** in the region **[are
from Russian military forces]{.underline}** **[in the
Arctic]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}** from Chinese **[influence
attempts]{.underline}**. **[Russian]{.underline}** military **[activity
in the Barents and]{.underline}** **[Greenland Seas]{.underline}** (the
northern part of the Greenland-Iceland-United Kingdom gap) **[poses the
most direct threat]{.underline}** to U.S. security interests. **[Russian
forces there could attack the U.S. homeland]{.underline}**, ships and
data links crossing the North Atlantic, and threaten NATO allies in
northern Europe. Russian forces in the Bering and Chukchi Seas off the
Alaskan coast are equally concerning. Russian capabilities could also be
used to flout international law through unilateral assertions of control
along the Northern Sea Route or the undersea Lomonosov Ridge, should the
Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf rule against Russia's
recent expansive claims to the Arctic seabed.

China's regional actions are troubling, particularly its use of
government-linked investments, loans, and trade deals to influence
Arctic states or populations. Threats could also arise from the military
potential in China's bathymetric mapping or its polar research stations
across Scandinavia. Any U.S. security strategy in the Arctic should
alleviate these threats.

The most obvious opportunities for the United States in the Arctic are
in private-sector infrastructure development and security coordination
with allies. Poor infrastructure and communications plague Alaska. A
hard-security strategy that prioritized infrastructure development in
the name of national security, a green-energy transformation, or
broadband connectivity initiatives could improve infrastructure and
resilience in Alaska. Internationally, security coordination among U.S.
allies and partners could generate momentum on nonsecurity behavioral
norms for resource extraction, investments, and economic cooperation
across the Arctic.

The Strategy's Ways and Means

**[To deter Russia]{.underline}** **[and China from]{.underline}**
**[threatening]{.underline}** U.S. **[interests]{.underline}** **[in the
Arctic]{.underline}**, **[the]{.underline}** **[U.S. military needs to
demonstrate presence]{.underline}** in the region
**[beyond]{.underline}** **[sub]{.underline}**marine**[s]{.underline}**.
**[Submarines can deter large-scale attacks but]{.underline}** are
**[less useful against]{.underline}** **[coercion]{.underline}** **[and
intimidation]{.underline}**. **[Deterring Russia]{.underline}** **[will
require]{.underline}** Navy **[surface assets]{.underline}** (**[manned
and unmanned]{.underline}**) **[and a more robust air and ground
presence]{.underline}** **[in the]{.underline}** European and North
Atlantic **[Arctic]{.underline}**. It is difficult to police fisheries,
monitor potentially hostile surface ships, or target airborne intruders
without capabilities in the region. As Adm. James Foggo said of the
Arctic when commanding Allied Joint Forces Command in Italy, "In order
to deter, you have to be present. You've got to be there and you've got
to be there quickly." Gen. Glen VanHerck, commander of U.S. Northern
Command and the North American Aerospace Defense Command, made similar
remarks in late April 2021.

Capabilities

Budget constraints, however, will prevent large-scale acquisition of
military equipment designed for the Arctic. There are just too many
competing demands on the defense budget. A handful of modern icebreakers
and limited numbers of the Army's new cold-weather vehicle may be the
extent of new, manned Arctic capabilities funded for the foreseeable
future. That said, the United States could shift cold-weather-capable
equipment to the region, especially unmanned intelligence, surveillance,
and reconnaissance platforms. Unmanned capabilities need not have been
developed for the Arctic per se but could be adapted for use in the
region.

There is a role for the U.S. private sector in developing Arctic
capabilities and infrastructure if given the right government
inducements. One promising area is satellite communication and
positioning systems. Satellite companies are potentially attractive
government partners. The U.S. military is looking into private-sector
efforts such as the OneWeb and Starlink polar communication satellites.
The European Space Agency is doing the same with Arctic weather
satellites. There is no reason these initiatives could not be expanded.

The Biden administration's Arctic strategy should consider the role of
extractive industries (oil, mining, timber, fishing) in the region.
Those industries have built much of the nonmilitary infrastructure in
Alaska. In the future, as the global economy shifts from hydrocarbons to
green energy, government efforts to foster infrastructure development
could focus on distributed electricity grids, port facilities, and
overland freight transport associated with mineral extraction
(particularly rare earth minerals) rather than on oil and gas. All are
consistent with the Biden climate plan. New ports and rail lines could
be funded through cost-sharing agreements between the government and
business, which could make infrastructure cost-effective for business
while saving the taxpayer money. The private sector could use the
infrastructure during normal times, with the U.S. military having
priority use during military exercises or national emergencies.

Political Will

Demonstrating the political will to use Arctic capabilities unilaterally
or in conjuncture with allies and partners is the other prerequisite for
successful deterrence and defense. The most important priority should be
to convince allies that the United States is a reliable security
partner. Some of that persuasion has already begun with the Biden
administration's reaffirmation of the U.S. commitment to NATO's Article
5 security guarantees and Blinken's consultations in Denmark before the
May 2021 Arctic Council ministerial meeting.

Persuading allies also requires demonstrating the ability to come to
their defense if needed, regardless of climate conditions.
**[Unilateral]{.underline}**, bilateral, and "mini-multilateral"
military exercises **[are]{.underline}** all **[useful as practice and
as international signals in the Arctic]{.underline}**.
**[Unilaterally]{.underline}**, **[the U.S. Army is starting to
relearn]{.underline}** **[how to operate]{.underline}** in the Arctic,
as highlighted in its Arctic strategy. The U.S. Navy and Marine Corps
learned important lessons from NATO's Trident Juncture exercise in 2018
and smaller exercises since then. More exercises are needed to
demonstrate to friend and foe alike that the U.S. military can again
operate in cold climates.

In addition, **[the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[should expand its use of]{.underline}**
flexible basing and deployment agreements with allies. The recent
agreement covering the U.S. military's use of the Ramsund naval facility
and Evenes air base in northern Norway are a good start. A similar
arrangement could be made for the Danish air force to have permanent
facilities at the U.S. base in Thule, Greenland, for **[search and
rescue]{.underline}**, **[air surveillance]{.underline}**,
**[a]{.underline}**nti-**[s]{.underline}**ubmarine
**[w]{.underline}**arfare, **[and air interdiction missions, something
that could tie allied forces]{.underline}** **[more]{.underline}**
closely **[together]{.underline}**, better defend this early warning
facility, and improve surveillance in the Greenland-Iceland-United
Kingdom gap. Expansion of the runway and facilities on Norway's Jan
Mayen island and refurbishing an additional airfield in Greenland in
conjunction with the Danes could serve similar purposes. Finally, the
United States could coordinate existing niche capabilities amongst
Arctic allies, an Arctic version of NATO's Connected Forces Initiative.

The Way Forward

**[The Biden administration]{.underline}** **[should]{.underline}**
**[publish a new]{.underline}** **[Arctic]{.underline}** **[national
security strategy]{.underline}**. **[The last U.S.]{.underline}** Arctic
**[strategy was]{.underline}** written **[in 2013]{.underline}**, before
the country refocused on geopolitical competition with Russia and China.
**[The strategy should prioritize deterring attacks from the
Arctic]{.underline}** on U.S. or allied territory, **[minimizing and
defending against Russian or Chinese coercion]{.underline}**, **[and
preventing either country from achieving]{.underline}** future regional
**[hegemony]{.underline}**. The United States could achieve these
objectives through cost-effective military acquisition, incentives for
private-sector infrastructure development, activities that demonstrate
military presence, and political and military commitments to Arctic
allies.

//EM

**[The ability of the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[to compete]{.underline}** in the 21st
century **[depends on U.S. leadership in data]{.underline}**
**[and]{.underline}** artificial intelligence (**[AI]{.underline}**). In
response, **[the]{.underline}** Department of Defense
(**[DoD]{.underline}**) **[is taking a new]{.underline}** and
much-needed **[approach]{.underline}** **[to U.S. defense]{.underline}**
**[efforts in data and AI]{.underline}**. David Spirk,
**[the]{.underline}** departing Chief Data Officer of the Pentagon, made
clear yesterday that the office of the Chief Digital and AI Officer
(**[CDAO]{.underline}**), in addition to its other functions, **[will be
the successor organization]{.underline}** for **[and replace
DoD's]{.underline}** much-touted Joint Artificial Intelligence Center
(**[JAIC]{.underline}**). While the JAIC symbolized DoD's efforts to get
smart on AI beginning in 2018, the integration of data and AI represents
a maturation of the U.S. AI approach---one that elevates the importance
of AI in national defense. The JAIC itself was not as important as what
the JAIC stood for---DoD's commitment to U.S. defense AI leadership. In
paving the way forward and getting AI on the agenda, the JAIC succeeded.
From this point on, **[a more cohesive approach]{.underline}**
**[to]{.underline}** **[AI and data]{.underline}**
**[through]{.underline}** **[the CDAO is more likely to accelerate AI
adoption]{.underline}** **[throughout]{.underline}** the **[U.S.
military because]{.underline}** **[it links DoD's]{.underline}** **[AI
efforts with data]{.underline}**, **[the]{.underline}** **[fuel AI
requires]{.underline}**. **[For U.S. defense]{.underline}** AI
**[adoption]{.underline}**, in particular, **[aligning these
organizations]{.underline}** **[could be game-changing]{.underline}**.
**[Addressing DoD's siloed data]{.underline}**,
**[standardizing]{.underline}** and improving **[its
quality]{.underline}** and access, **[is a precondition]{.underline}**
**[to having the]{.underline}** **[data necessary]{.underline}** **[to
train algorithms]{.underline}** for many defense uses, and any future
technologies that rely on collecting, processing, and using information.
**[Implementation]{.underline}** **[will be critical]{.underline}**
**[and]{.underline}** **[heavily dependent]{.underline}** on two things.
First, **[to catalyze]{.underline}** AI **[adoption]{.underline}**,
**[the CDAO will need to]{.underline}** **[develop]{.underline}**
**[close relationships]{.underline}** **[with the military
services]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}** combatant
**[commands]{.underline}**. Second, **[the CDAO]{.underline}** **[will
need to coordinate with]{.underline}** **[DoD's research]{.underline}**
**[and development]{.underline}** **[organizations]{.underline}**, such
as the Defense Innovation Unit, leading on AI experimentation and
research. There is hard work ahead, but the new organizational design is
promising.

The office of the CDAO brings together previously independent components
of DoD: the JAIC, the office of the Chief Data Officer, the Defense
Digital Service (DDS), and the Office of Advancing Analytics (ADVANA).
The office of the Chief Data Officer is in charge of data management and
coordination, DDS finds digital solutions for internal data and security
issues, and ADVANA aggregates data and conducts data analytics. The
combination of these offices raised questions about whether an
independent JAIC was necessary for U.S. defense AI leadership. Departing
CDO Spirk says that the CDAO will be "taking the best parts of all the
organizations it is overseeing and redistributing them for faster and
better decision-making." We agree. At present, not only is DoD's data
siloed but its AI efforts and initiatives are as well. According to the
company Govini, in FY21, fifteen separate departments and organizations
funded and worked on AI and AI-adjacent technologies, often without
formal coordination or throughlines. This has led to redundancies, gaps,
inconsistencies in application and access to data and resources, and an
overall hodge-podge of AI efforts. DoD has acknowledged this and is
making organizational changes necessary to accelerate AI adoption even
more by restructuring its AI approach from the ground up. Now, CDAO will
have teams working on policy and governance, technology development, and
rolling out data and AI for the Pentagon and the military services, to
avoid bureaucratic duplication and confusion that could undermine the
CDAO's overall authority. In particular, bringing the data and AI teams
together will improve the data DoD needs for AI development.

Some might fear that the reorganization of the JAIC's functions within
the CDAO means the United States is not as committed to the role of AI
in the future of U.S. national defense. Based on current information,
this concern is misplaced. First, **[the JAIC]{.underline}**
**[was]{.underline}** **[created so the U.S. military]{.underline}**
**[could]{.underline}** effectively **[take advantage of the way
AI]{.underline}** **[will shape the future of war]{.underline}**. It
succeeded in many ways. Recognition of the importance of AI for the
future of U.S. defense, and national security in general, is much more
widespread. The JAIC made headway on AI adoption and data literacy, with
initiatives like "AI 101," and on the data integration issue, as part of
the Artificial Intelligence and Data Initiative (AIDA). The military
services are investing more in AI and related technologies such as
autonomous systems. This, ironically, makes an independent JAIC less
necessary.

Second, **[the JAIC]{.underline}** **[has also faced
challenges]{.underline}** **[that the]{.underline}**
**[CDAO]{.underline}** approach **[can address]{.underline}**. The JAIC
had multiple missions, including advising DoD on AI adoption, funding AI
research, and building AI tools itself. **[The JAIC]{.underline}** also
**[lacked the authority to advance]{.underline}** military **[service
adoption]{.underline}** of AI on its own, or to itself transform the
connection between AI and overall DoD policy and strategy. **[The JAIC
ended up]{.underline}** arguably **[not policy-focused]{.underline}**
**[enough to lead on policy]{.underline}**, **[and]{.underline}** **[not
technically equipped enough to lead]{.underline}** **[on]{.underline}**
algorithm **[development]{.underline}**. While the JAIC encouraged AI
investment within DoD, its existence also highlighted how the
uncoordinated DoD AI portfolio required even more organization. The CDAO
approach will address some of these issues by fusing DoD data and AI
efforts, as will a growing focus on AI in other DoD components, from
Research & Engineering on the technology development side to OSD-Policy
(Office of the Secretary of Defense Policy) on the strategy and
governance side.

Third, it is difficult to get things immediately right when it comes to
converting emerging technologies into adopted innovations, especially
for conservative institutions like militaries. We think about
experimentation as a critical part of how the technology invention
process works, but the same is true when it comes to transforming
organizations. **[Given the way data access]{.underline}** **[and
integration]{.underline}** **[are essential to
innovation]{.underline}**, **[consolidating data and AI]{.underline}**,
rather than having a specific JAIC only focused on AI, **[will
make]{.underline}** technological **[adoption across DoD more
likely]{.underline}**.

**[Nevertheless]{.underline}**, **[individual NATO
members]{.underline}** **[with]{.underline}** territory or
**[territorial waters in]{.underline}** the Arctic (Canada, Denmark,
Iceland, Norway, and the United States) **[have taken the initiative to
advance their]{.underline}** Arctic **[interests]{.underline}**.
Recently, **[the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates has **[taken a more assertive role in the
region]{.underline}**. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called out Russian
and Chinese Arctic behavior at the May 2019 Arctic Council ministerial
meeting, the U.S. Air Force has stationed more fifth-generation fighter
planes in Alaska than exist in any other location on the planet, and the
U.S. Navy reactivated the Second Fleet with responsibilities for the
North Atlantic. The Defense Department and individual services have
released, or will release, several Arctic strategies. The U.S. Coast
Guard published an Arctic Strategic Outlook in April 2019, followed by
an Arctic strategy from the Defense Department in June 2019 and the U.S.
Air Force in July 2020. The Navy and Army are expected to follow suit
with revised Arctic strategies in late 2020 and 2021 respectively.

So far, **[all of those strategies]{.underline}** **[reference the value
of regional partnerships with like-minded states]{.underline}**, which
begs the question --- should NATO play a greater role in the Arctic?
Some argue yes, saying that NATO should create an Arctic security forum
with Russia or engage in visible contingency planning. Others disagree,
believing that since there is no consensus within the alliance on
actions in the Arctic, the matter should be left to individual member
states. Camille Grand, **[NATO's assistant secretary general for defense
investment]{.underline}**, **[said]{.underline}** when asked about the
topic in an a recent interview, "**[I don't think we are there
yet."]{.underline}**

**[NATO]{.underline}** itself **[should play a very
limited]{.underline}**, **[direct role in the Arctic.]{.underline}**
**[The alliance should only engage in]{.underline}** circumscribed
**[contingency planning and conduct the occasional large
exercise]{.underline}** like Trident Juncture in 2018. **[To do more
risks weakening alliance unity and needlessly antagonizing
Russia]{.underline}**. Specifically, **[NATO should avoid creating a new
alliance command dedicated to the Arctic]{.underline}**, pushing for
Sweden and Finland to join the alliance, **[or establishing a new Arctic
security forum between NATO and Russia]{.underline}**.
**[These]{.underline}** policy **[options have been floated in expert
dialogues and ought to be tabled]{.underline}**, at least for now.
**[Rather than coordinating through NATO]{.underline}**, which would
continue today's policy, **[member states]{.underline}** and their
non-NATO partners **[should meet]{.underline}** Arctic security
**[threats by engaging in]{.underline}** more frequent and deeper
**[unilateral]{.underline}**, bilateral, or coalition-of-the-willing
**[defense cooperation focused on]{.underline}** cold weather
**[training, regular military exercises, and rotational force
deployments]{.underline}**. **[This is a subtle but important
distinction]{.underline}**. **[Some]{.underline}** physical
**[activities would look the same]{.underline}** in this alternative
policy, **[but they would not be under a NATO moniker]{.underline}**.

#### Unilateral action [incentivizes]{.underline} NATO to repair [cyber vulnerabilities]{.underline} AND creates [US resiliency]{.underline} to avoid attacks.

Opportunities for DoD." *Defense Innovation Board*,

original\]

*Recommendation #1*

**[DoD needs to make a plan]{.underline}** **[for sharing]{.underline}**
**[sub-6 GHz spectrum to shape]{.underline}** the **[future 5G
ecosystem, including]{.underline}** **[an assessment of
how]{.underline}** **[much]{.underline}** and which
**[bandwidths]{.underline}** **[need to be shared]{.underline}**, within
what timeframe, and how that sharing will impact DoD systems.

- **[DoD and the FCC]{.underline}** **[must flip their prioritization
  from mmWave]{.underline}** **[to sub-6]{.underline}** GHz **[spectrum
  for 5G]{.underline}**. DoD and FCC have been prioritizing the 28 and
  37 GHz bandwidths as options for 5G development, but this effort is
  misplaced. This study has covered the broad range of limitations
  associated with mmWave, and reasons why the rest of the world will
  adopt a sub-6 GHz 5G ecosystem. In light of this, DoD must prepare
  itself for that future operating environment by focusing on
  co-existing, if not explicitly sharing, with civil 5G operations in
  those bands of spectrum.

- **[DoD should particularly focus on the bands of the sub-6 GHz
  spectrum that are already being used by China.]{.underline}** Chinese
  5G systems and infrastructure operate in the 3.2-3.6 GHz range, as
  well as the 4.8-5.0 GHz range. As a result, the commercial world has
  developed semiconductors and handsets that are configured for that
  range, and DoD should angle for the most developed market to expedite
  5G sub-6 GHz deployment in the United States. It takes approximately
  two years to add new frequency bands to complex multiband
  transceivers, and the United States would be able to avoid those two
  years of development by leveraging subcomponents and devices already
  on the market for more mature spectrum usage, such as existing
  Qualcomm products with functionality in the bands leveraged by China.

- As an additional consideration, DoD currently occupies \~500 MHz of
  space in the 4 GHz spectrum. DoD should take action to share parts of
  this space, given that it is a material amount of bandwidth that could
  make a serious impact on 5G development. 5G functions most optimally
  on large amounts of consecutive bandwidth, and this range could
  provide the real estate to drive 5G development forward.

- For additional spectrum availability, DoD should recommend that the
  NTIA, FCC and Department of State should advocate the reallocation of
  the C-band satellite spectrum to IMT-2000 5G use at the World Radio
  Conference later this year (WRC-19), and take measures to adopt
  sharing in all 500 MHz of the band in the United States on an
  accelerated basis for fixed operations. While this will have limited
  impact on the U.S. 5G mobile ecosystem, sharing in this band could
  provide broad coverage at 100 Mbps and above for fixed broadband
  service to a large section of the rural United States.

- **[DoD should]{.underline}** encourage other government agencies to
  **[incentivize industry]{.underline}** **[to adopt a common 5G network
  for sub-6 deployment]{.underline}**. **[Incentives can include:
  accelerated depreciation]{.underline}**, **[tax
  incentives]{.underline}**, **[low interest loans and]{.underline}**
  government **[purchase of equipment]{.underline}** and
  **[services]{.underline}**.

- This recommendation does not call for the eviction of DoD systems
  operating in the sub-6 GHz spectrum, nor does it call for the sharing
  of ALL DoD spectrum. DoD must conduct thoughtful but candid analyses
  of the cost and schedule associated with sharing different spectrum
  bands, and prioritize accordingly.

- However, DoD must bear in mind that the status quo of spectrum
  allocation is unsustainable. 5G capability requires larger bands of
  spectrum, and without that additional bandwidth, the United States
  will not gain true 5G capability beyond the limited range that mmWave
  can provide. In the next year, DoD is in the position to enable or
  inhibit 5G adoption in the United States based on its use of sub-6 GHz
  spectrum.

- DoD stands to significantly benefit if it shares some of its sub-6 GHz
  spectrum. As the commercial sector develops and deploys 5G
  technologies and networks, DoD will be able to leverage commercial
  innovations to build its own new and improved technologies and
  networks. At a strategic level, 5G can create a step-change in
  situational awareness and decision-making by integrating more systems
  into a network that shares more data faster and at lower latency.

- This effort will require close coordination with NTIA to clear and
  reassign spectrum. Timing is critical - it is not enough to simply
  share spectrum, it must be done quickly to keep the United States
  competitive with China, South Korea, and Japan.

- **[Without aggressive action]{.underline}** **[as outlined in
  this]{.underline}** **[report]{.underline}**, **[we believe there is a
  high likelihood]{.underline}** **[that the]{.underline}**
  **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
  **[will]{.underline}** **[be unable to convince]{.underline}** **[the
  rest of the world]{.underline}** **[to adopt mmWave
  technologies]{.underline}** **[as the standard 5G
  pathway]{.underline}**. This may bifurcate the global market and
  result in the majority of the world adopting 5G sub-6 technologies,
  which will be dominated by the Chinese equipment and handset
  manufacturers.

*Recommendation #2*

[DoD must **prepare** to **operate in a "post-Western"**]{.underline}
[wireless]{.underline} ecosystem. This [plan should include **R&D
investments** towards **system security**]{.underline} [and
**resiliency**]{.underline} [on an engineering]{.underline} and
strategic level.

- Sharing parts of the sub-6 spectrum will certainly help the U.S. 5G
  effort, but gaining a competitive edge over China would require action
  at a rate and magnitude previously unseen within DoD. For this reason,
  it is probable that most of the world outside of the United States
  will adopt a sub-6 5G solution, forcing DoD to operate on a
  "post-Western" wireless ecosystem. In this event, **[DoD should assume
  that all]{.underline}** network **[infrastructure]{.underline}**
  **[will ultimately]{.underline}** **[become vulnerable]{.underline}**
  **[to cyber-attack]{.underline}** **[from]{.underline}** both an
  **[encryption and resiliency standpoint]{.underline}**.

- **[DoD must adopt a "zero-trust" network model]{.underline}**.
  **[Perimeter]{.underline}** defense **[models]{.underline}** **[have
  been proven to be ineffective]{.underline}**, and 5G will only
  exacerbate this problem as more systems are linked into a common
  network. Information access should no longer be granted simply through
  attachment to a specific network, and instead should be granted
  through various security checks within the network.
  **[DoD]{.underline}** **[should]{.underline}** also **[plan to move to
  quantum-resistant key exchange]{.underline}** **[mechanisms to deal
  with the]{.underline}** **[eventual fall of]{.underline}** public
  **[key exchange algorithms]{.underline}**, particularly given China's
  investments in quantum computing.

- While "zero-trust" networks can protect context exchange through
  cryptography, these exchanges will still be subject to traffic
  analysis and detection of surges in network utilization. DoD should
  work to keep large amounts of data flowing on a constant basis so that
  increases in operational tempo will not be noticed.

- In addition to these security precautions, **[DoD must brace for
  cyber-attack]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}** penetration **[by
  improving resiliency]{.underline}** **[and building in layers of
  redundancy]{.underline}** **[throughout its networks]{.underline}** to
  ensure uninterrupted connectivity.

- DoD will need to consider options for defending against a compromised
  supply chain, where Chinese semiconductor components and chipsets are
  embedded across multiple systems. DoD should invest in R&D to study
  the impact of compartmentalizing systems to limit an attacker's
  ability to move laterally into other systems. This will come with
  performance costs, and DoD must find the line where it can balance
  baseline capability with security.

- **[DoD should advocate]{.underline}** **[for aggressive protection of
  U.S.]{.underline}** technology intellectual property rights
  (**[IPR)]{.underline}** **[in an effort to]{.underline}** **[slow
  down]{.underline}** **[China's]{.underline}** **[telecommunications
  ecosystem]{.underline}** **[expansion]{.underline}**.
  **[The]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited
  **[S]{.underline}**tates **[should leverage export controls to slow
  the rate]{.underline}** **[of market loss]{.underline}** **[for
  Western]{.underline}** **[vendors]{.underline}**, even if it may
  increase the pace at which China becomes self-sufficient.

- DoD will increasingly be driven to operate on shared commercial
  networks without their own bespoke infrastructure (as in the case of
  nuclear C3). DoD must analyze the risks and benefits associated with
  that shift, and adjust its concept of operations to account for it.

- DoD needs to consider the broader implications of a compromised supply
  chain, such as risk to personal devices and information that can be
  derived from activity on those DIB 5G Study Preliminary Release, 3
  April 2019 30 devices. If China is able to collect this data, DoD
  should consider discrete directives to defend against these
  vulnerabilities that fall outside the traditional DoD systems and
  platforms, such as training to limit inadvertent sharing of PII
  through personal device use.

- In addition to these efforts, **[DoD should initiate testing
  and]{.underline}** **[experimentation on its bases for
  future]{.underline}** **[generations of]{.underline}** wireless
  technology beyond **[5G]{.underline}**. This testing and
  experimentation will occur over a longer timeframe to ensure that the
  United States is prepared to lead the next generational transition.
  These activities can include testing for sub-6 sharing, as well as
  future mmWave deployment and propagation improvement.

*Recommendation #3*

[**DoD** should advocate]{.underline} [for **adjusted trade policies**
to **discourage vulnerabilities** in its **supply chain**]{.underline}
on the grounds [that they put national security assets]{.underline} and
missions [at risk.]{.underline}

- The compromised supply chain issue poses a serious threat to national
  security by introducing vulnerabilities into networks and systems,
  which can be leveraged by a hostile actor to disrupt DoD operations.
  The spread of these vulnerabilities creates an increasingly unstable
  environment by lowering barriers to offensive action while weakening
  defensive positions.

- The proliferation of security vulnerabilities creates incentives for
  all nations to take offensive action in a conflict, as the barrier to
  offense decreases while the difficulty of defense increases. This
  reality is reflected in the new U.S. Cyber doctrine of "forward
  defense".

- To counter this threat, DoD should advocate that trade policy reward
  good security/coding and penalize vulnerabilities through tariffs
  ("monetization" of good development practices). For example,
  **[the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited
  **[S]{.underline}**tates **[could]{.underline}** automatically
  **[impose a heavy tariff]{.underline}** (say, 75%) **[on any goods
  from any nation found to have backdoors]{.underline}**
  **[or]{.underline}** serious security
  **[vulnerabilities]{.underline}**. This would impose a market cost for
  insecurity, and would also create incentives for domestic companies to
  fund security researchers to find vulnerabilities in competitors'
  products, thereby triggering the tariff. **[This would improve the
  overall security of]{.underline}** **[DoD ecosystems without having to
  disclose vulnerabilities]{.underline}** found by Title 50 entities.

- **[The]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited
  **[S]{.underline}**tates **[should encourage Five Eyes and NATO
  partners]{.underline}** **[to adopt]{.underline}** the **[same
  tariffs]{.underline}**, regardless of product country of origin. The
  United States stands to benefit the most in a trade conflict over
  security of devices.

The **[deployment of 5G networks]{.underline}** **[by]{.underline}** the
**[U.S. military]{.underline}** **[will]{.underline}** be an **[historic
moment]{.underline}** **[for]{.underline}** **[today's
warfighter]{.underline}**. **[From improved]{.underline}**
**[C5ISR]{.underline}** \[command, control, computers, communications,
cyber, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance\] **[readiness and
geolocation accuracy to more effective]{.underline}** enemy
**[engagement and perimeter defense]{.underline}**, **[5G gear will
enable scalable]{.underline}**, extremely **[low-latency]{.underline}**,
mobile radio platforms and an Internet of Things edge-sensor network
that puts the power of real-time AI and machine learning into the hands
of the combat soldier. This future state is achievable, but not without
confronting a blunt reality: **[5G is an open architecture designed for
commercial applications and]{.underline}** as such **[suffers
from]{.underline}** a **[great]{.underline}** many security
**[vulnerabilities]{.underline}**. **[To build a
resilient]{.underline}**, secure, **[survivable 5G military
communications network,]{.underline}** **[we must]{.underline}** first
**[harden and future-proof the COTS]{.underline}** \[commercial
off-the-shelf\]-based **[hardware, software, and firmware]{.underline}**
that **[are the foundation of today's]{.underline}** civilian 5G
**[infrastructure]{.underline}**.

As commercial 5G service rolls out across the U.S. with the promise of
100 times greater speeds than its 4G predecessor, it's time to examine
how the U.S. military can equip the modern warfighter with an upgrade to
today's outmoded battlefield communications infrastructure.

This is no small feat. 5G was designed by an international coalition of
technology companies, with heavy input from state-owned Chinese firms.
As an open-source, commercial standard, 5G is riddled with potential
security threats, nearly 800 of which have yet to be resolved by the
governing 3GPP standards body. Moreover, the uptake of 5G by the
warfighter will require the U.S. military to forego a decades-long
practice of developing bespoke, incompatible radio hardware and move
toward a shared, hardened communications framework.

Communications alignment is a national security imperative

The good news? The overhaul and unification of the military's
communications network is already underway in key areas.

**[The]{.underline}** U.S. Department of Defense **[(DoD) is committed
to its]{.underline}** Joint All-Domain Command and Control (**[JADC2)
mission]{.underline}**, which according to the Congressional Research
Service (CRS), **[aims to "connect sensors from all military
services]{.underline}** -- Air Force, Army, Marine Corps, Navy, and
Space Force -- **[into a single network]{.underline}**." **[This alone
will accelerate the speed of decision-making for the
soldier]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}** command-and-control (**[C2)
center]{.underline}**, **[which is an urgently needed component of the
U.S.'s]{.underline}** **[National Defense Strategy as it prepares for
the]{.underline}** emergence of Mach 5+ **[hypersonic
weapons]{.underline}**.

The U.S. Air Force is contributing to the JADC2 mission by developing
the Advanced Battle Management System (ABMS), **[a C2 framework that the
CRS describes]{.underline}** **[as "using secure]{.underline}** cloud
**[environments and new communications methods]{.underline}** to allow
Air Force and Space Force systems to share data seamlessly **[using
artificial intelligence."]{.underline}** In effect, this is an attempt
at integrating a sensor-based Internet of Things (IoT) network that
reinvents the conventional, airborne C2 structure by extending the eyes
and ears of our warfighters to an intelligent edge.

Just as importantly, a unified communications topology must support the
nation's Nuclear Command and Control System (NCCS), which guides the
chain of command in providing the President with information required to
authorize (and prevent unauthorized) use of nuclear weapons.

Allure of 5G processing speeds tempered by inherent security risks

The military has long been eager to build a common telecommunications
and computing platform that enables new software applications to be
adopted at the same speed as the commercial sector -- or better yet,
harden Android and Apple iOS smartphones for use in the field. At best,
however, today's warfighter is relegated to using the phone's GPS map
function for geolocation, which is often more reliable than their
military-issued gear.

5G is the enabling technology that will underpin the military's digital
transformation, but 5G was never designed as a native military radio
waveform. This reality presents significant challenges and entails the
recognition that more than 60% of what the 3GPP ratified as 4G and 5G
standards were developed primarily by state-owned Chinese companies.
That raises concerns relative to the influence China may have exercised
over an industry standards-making body -- and the number of unsecured
backdoors and man-in-the-middle vulnerabilities through which classified
data can be siphoned or modified.

As a point of reference, a 2019 report released by IoT cybersecurity
specialist, Finite State, looked into Huawei Technologies and found that
55 percent of tested Huawei devices had at least one potential backdoor.
In its summary of findings, Finite State concluded that "if you include
known, remote access vulnerabilities along with possible back doors,
Huawei devices appear to be at high risk of potential compromise."

What a 5G future will look like for the warfighter

The future 5G state we should be working to realize will enable users to
harness the power of AI, machine learning, and hundreds of thousands of
sensors at the IoT edge. Doing so will give troops real-time
intelligence and processing while providing secure battlefield computing
and communications using fixed and transportable cellular towers
supplemented by vehicle-mounted data center nodes. All of this can be
achieved using commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware, software, and
firmware, as long as it's all sufficiently hardened to ensure a secure
connection to both the network and computing platform.

So, practically speaking, what would a typical 5G application look like?
Let's consider base security: A lot of what occurs on the battlefield
involves establishing and maintaining a security perimeter. We can
surmise that 5G-enabled communications technology will enable easy
supplementation of the perimeter with field-of-motion and pressure
sensors. When activated, those sensors feed into a tower-based alert
system that sends out drones to investigate. The drones leverage video
streaming and facial recognition, and if a threat is detected, can
trigger an automated targeting system. If deployed properly, 5G will
enable users to very quickly automate their field operations.

Marry the cell tower and data center node

In a commercial 5G application, a smartphone streaming data sends a
signal to a nearby tower, which routes the request to a data center that
may be hundreds of miles away. The data is retrieved and sent back
through the tower and on to the user. That's a large threat surface, as
was seen with the May 2021 Colonial Pipeline ransomware cyberattack.

**[A more secure]{.underline}**, **[resilient solution is to
co-locate]{.underline}** **[the cell tower]{.underline}**
**[and]{.underline}** data **[center and build hundreds of them as part
of a distributed]{.underline}**, compartmentalized
**[network]{.underline}**. **[Not only does this provide
better,]{.underline}** more even **[coverage, but if one tower is
compromised the others will continue to send]{.underline}** and receive
**[data]{.underline}**. In turn, that **[data is wrapped in
purpose-built security layers from the inside out]{.underline}** -- not
as a programming afterthought -- **[and provides the warfighter with a
"zero-trust network" that includes]{.underline}**
**[encryption]{.underline}**, user authentication, **[sandboxing,
behavioral analytics, and other protective measures]{.underline}**.

It's this concept that led to the development of the SEMPRE Tower, which
is based on the idea that a hardened, COTS-based 5G telecommunications
and computing infrastructure can be adapted by **[the]{.underline}**
military to improve collaboration on the battlefield while maintaining a
secure, resilient C5ISR \[command, control, computers, communications,
cyber, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance\]
**[framework]{.underline}** that **[can withstand a]{.underline}**
nuclear electromagnetic pulse **[(EMP) attack]{.underline}**. (Figure

A coronavirus-induced economic crisis could send Europe bargain-shopping
for critical infrastructure---in ways that might be dangerous.
**[Europe's argument on moving forward]{.underline}**
**[with]{.underline}** the **[implementation of Huawei 5G
technology]{.underline}** **[against U.S. objections]{.underline}**
**[has]{.underline}** long **[centered on cutting costs]{.underline}**.
**[The U.S. calls for a ban of the]{.underline}** Chinese
**[telecommunications]{.underline}** **[firm's 5G
equipment]{.underline}** **[in European networks]{.underline}**
**[have]{.underline}** **[failed to gain traction]{.underline}** in most
European capitals. Just a handful of countries have echoed U.S. demands
for tougher restrictions to supplement the recently released EU toolbox
for 5G security, and even fewer have called for an outright ban.

The United States has highlighted the risks that Huawei poses to
national security, including the threat of espionage. Given the Chinese
Community Party's effective control of Huawei, there is concern over
data integrity. More serious is the potential to debilitate critical
infrastructure. 5G will be the backbone of communications and controls
needed for power grids, water supplies, and transportation
infrastructure. In January, the United Kingdom announced it would allow
Huawei equipment on 35 percent of its 5G networks---a decision that
could provide top cover for Germany, France, and others to do the same.

Even so, there are bright spots. **[Estonia and Poland]{.underline}**
**[announced]{.underline}** **[stronger restrictions]{.underline}**
**[to ensure]{.underline}** **[5G network security]{.underline}**,
**[and]{.underline}** **[some]{.underline}** lawmakers, such as Iain
Duncan Smith in the United Kingdom and Norbert Röttgen in Germany,
**[remain opposed to Huawei's inclusion]{.underline}** **[in their
networks]{.underline}**, leaving hope that a clear-eyed risk assessment
will prevail. Recently, technology industry leaders for open radio
access networks sent a letter to the U.K. House of Commons Defense
Committee urging it to abandon implementation of Huawei technology.
Given the uneven response across Europe, where should the United States
go from here? It can still sway countries that remain on the fence, but
it will need to change tack.

For one, **[the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[should create a multilateral
coalition]{.underline}** **[with like-minded]{.underline}** **[European
allies]{.underline}**, **[such as Poland]{.underline}**, **[the Czech
Republic,]{.underline}** **[and Estonia, to reboot
conversations]{.underline}** **[about Huawei's]{.underline}**
**[role]{.underline}** in Europe. **[A number of European]{.underline}**
**[countries perceive]{.underline}** **[Washington]{.underline}** **[as
a self-interested]{.underline}** **[messenger]{.underline}** and see its
fight against Huawei as merely part of a geopolitical game against
China. **[That's a criticism Washington]{.underline}** **[should
answer]{.underline}**, **[and it can emphasize]{.underline}** a **[few
key messages]{.underline}** to do so.

**[The coalition should]{.underline}** **[emphasize]{.underline}**
**[that the EU toolbox]{.underline}** **[is designed]{.underline}**
**[to be a baseline]{.underline}** **[for]{.underline}** a **[common
approach]{.underline}**, **[not a final answer]{.underline}**. **[The
coalition should]{.underline}** **[emphasize]{.underline}** **[that the
EU toolbox]{.underline}** **[is designed to be a baseline]{.underline}**
**[for]{.underline}** a **[common approach]{.underline}**, not a final
answer. **[Countries]{.underline}** **[should do their own risk
assessments]{.underline}** **[based on their]{.underline}** technical
**[capabilities to]{.underline}** mitigate risk and **[secure their
networks]{.underline}**. **[The coalition]{.underline}**
**[should]{.underline}** also **[dispel the oft-cited
myth]{.underline}** **[that there are no viable]{.underline}**
**[alternatives to Huawei]{.underline}**. The United States, and
European adopters of Nokia and Ericsson technology, must tout the value
and quality of Nokia and Ericsson kit. For one, the United States should
point to the obvious fact that it is building world-class 5G networks
using solely Nokia and Ericsson radio access network equipment.

Then there's the pernicious myth, pushed by Huawei's public relations
team and through Huawei-commissioned reports, that the firm is the
undisputed 5G technology leader. While Huawei leads the pack in number
of patents, qualitative assessments show that the value of its portfolio
is much less than that of its competitors---a classic case of quantity
over quality.

Finally, **[the coalition]{.underline}** **[should]{.underline}** also
**[take on the cost argument]{.underline}**. **[While
Huawei]{.underline}** **[may provide]{.underline}** **[the cheapest
upfront option]{.underline}** on the market, **[countries should examine
how Huawei]{.underline}** could **[impose hidden costs]{.underline}**
**[on the backend]{.underline}** **[for]{.underline}** maintenance and
**[installation]{.underline}**, **[beyond]{.underline}** **[the
considerable expense]{.underline}** **[associated with risk
mitigation]{.underline}** efforts.

**[The]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
**[should also lead to make new alternatives to Huawei
available]{.underline}**. **[A promising approach]{.underline}** **[is
to promote open architecture as a way to upend]{.underline}** **[the 5G
status]{.underline}** **[quo]{.underline}**. Open architecture consists
of proprietary software for functions like switching, routing, and
firewalls that run on vendor-neutral hardware and standardized
interfaces. **[This]{.underline}** **[would offer Europe]{.underline}**
**[a new way to bypass]{.underline}** **[adoption]{.underline}** **[of
Huawei]{.underline}** **[in ways]{.underline}** **[that
promote]{.underline}** vendor **[diversity]{.underline}**, **[lower
cost, and better interoperability]{.underline}**. The United States
should work with Finland and Sweden to help Nokia and Ericsson, Huawei's
key competitors, transition to this new telecommunications
infrastructure model over the next three to five years.

The United States must face the reality of Europe's strong reliance on
China for economic growth. Beijing has been clear that it is willing to
retaliate over any country's decision to ban Huawei from its networks
with economic coercion. In December, China's ambassador to Berlin
threatened to torpedo German car sales in China. Beijing directed
similar warnings at France. In order to remove the teeth from China's
threats, the United States must show Europe that it is a reliable trade
partner, ending its deleterious trade policies toward Europe and threats
to levy tariffs on European goods. Further, the United States should
expedite U.S.-EU trade agreement negotiations. A robust agreement would
help stimulate economic growth and assure Europe that the United States
has its back when European countries exclude Huawei from their networks.
The United States remains the largest single export destination for EU
goods, nearly twice as big as China. Washington should use this economic
clout as a bulwark, not a bludgeon.

Finally, **[the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[should focus more on the norms
and]{.underline}** **[values]{.underline}** **[that it shares
with]{.underline}** **[its]{.underline}** European **[partners to
dissuade]{.underline}** **[them from]{.underline}**
**[purchasing]{.underline}** **[Chinese
telecommunications]{.underline}** **[equipment]{.underline}**. **[A
large part of]{.underline}** **[Huawei's]{.underline}**
**[success]{.underline}** in Europe **[stems from its large-scale
lobbying]{.underline}** campaign **[to convince Europe that it is
a]{.underline}** **[trustworthy vendor]{.underline}**. Huawei launched a
campaign highlighting its so-called shared values with Europe. Huawei
has likened voting for Huawei 5G with voting for European values.
Largely absent from the 5G debate is the fact that China generally, and
Huawei specifically, uses 5G technologies as part of its campaign to
suppress and isolate Uighurs in Xinjiang, counter protesters in Hong
Kong, and exert greater control over the daily lives of all Chinese.
Buying Huawei kit subsidizes these actions---ones that go against the
core values of the EU itself.

**[The]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
**[is more than holding its own in 5G]{.underline}**. 5G is more than
cellular telephony. It is a central part of a new digital environment
that blends artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and 5G networks to
enable new services and products. 5G meets the growing demand to create
and move data and new knowledge faster and more efficiently to support
an increasingly digital and interconnected economy.

This 5G strategy offers a comprehensive approach to network
technologies, building on the strength of the United States to innovate
and invest while designing government policies to support and complement
those strengths. The report is the work of a group of experts and
provides ideas and recommendations on how to speed infrastructure
deployment, how to ensure supply chain security, and how to accelerate
5G use. Our recommendations include:

**[Accelerate spectrum repurposing]{.underline}**. **[Compared
to]{.underline}** other **[countries]{.underline}**,
**[the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
**[is doing well in allocating high-band and low-band]{.underline}**
**[spectrum for 5G]{.underline}**. **[However]{.underline}**, **[it lags
in the]{.underline}** **[allocation of mid-band spectrum]{.underline}**.
**[The]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
**[needs to repurpose]{.underline}** **[mid-band spectrum for 5G
using]{.underline}** **[auctions]{.underline}**, spectrum sharing
technologies, and compensation for agencies if they need to relocate.
The recent C-band auction, while expensive, was an important step in
providing the spectrum needed for American 5G networks.

**[Remove regulatory obstacles]{.underline}**. **[Telecommunications
regulation in the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[is a complex blend of federal]{.underline}**
and local **[authorities]{.underline}**. **[The
interpretation]{.underline}** and implementation **[of those rules by
some local governments has often been inconsistent]{.underline}**. The
next administration should continue efforts to remove regulatory
obstacles, accelerate deployment, and identify those instances where
federal law should supersede local regulation to provide uniform
national rules.

**[Promote supply chain trust]{.underline}**. The two keys to supply
chain trust are promoting supplier diversity and creating risk
management strategies for technology acquirers. **[The work of
the]{.underline}** **[D]{.underline}**epartment of
**[H]{.underline}**omeland **[S]{.underline}**ecurity's
**[I]{.underline}**nformation and **[C]{.underline}**ommunications
**[T]{.underline}**echnology **[S]{.underline}**upply
**[C]{.underline}**hain **[R]{.underline}**isk
**[M]{.underline}**anagement **[T]{.underline}**ask
**[F]{.underline}**orce **[provides guidance on supply chain
security]{.underline}**, **[and the]{.underline}**
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[can encourage the
adoption and use of the Prague Proposals]{.underline}**, including the
criteria developed by this working group, for governments and network
owners or operators **[to determine trustworthiness and
security]{.underline}**. **[An essential action for]{.underline}**
**[building trust is for the]{.underline}** Federal Communications
Commission (**[FCC]{.underline}**) **[to move ahead with Rip and
Replace]{.underline}**, using the \$1.9 billion recently provided by
Congress.

**[Directly counter predatory practices]{.underline}**. **[Use
transparency and]{.underline}** diplomatic **[pressure to counter
predatory practices]{.underline}**. **[The]{.underline}**
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[should make
transparency]{.underline}** and accountability **[for predatory trade
practices a central part of 5G policy]{.underline}**. In other areas,
**[it has been helpful to intervene privately with
foreign]{.underline}** **[governments]{.underline}** or to make public
instances of foreign corrupt practices. **[The]{.underline}**
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates and its partners
**[should expose Chinese misbehavior]{.underline}**, **[such as illicit
subsidies]{.underline}**, **[and assign intelligence resources to
identify]{.underline}** predatory **[behavior]{.underline}**.

**[Redirect American]{.underline}** and allied export
**[credits]{.underline}**. **[One major advantage Huawei has is that its
prices are subsidized]{.underline}**, **[making them]{.underline}**
**[artificially low]{.underline}**. **[We do not need to match Chinese
subsidies]{.underline}**, **[but]{.underline}** we **[do need to reduce
the financial burden of not buying from Huawei]{.underline}**.
**[Cooperative policies with Japan, Australia, Korea, and
the]{.underline}** **[E]{.underline}**uropean **[U]{.underline}**nion
**[to use foreign assistance]{.underline}**,
**[co-financing]{.underline}**, **[and export support in the developing
world for]{.underline}** 5G **[infrastructure can accomplish
this]{.underline}** but require reforms to ExIm Bank rules and
procedures.

Make 5G security part of a larger cybersecurity strategy. Building on
the work already done in the European Union, **[a 5G cybersecurity
strategy should look beyond supply chain security to build cooperative
mechanisms among allies for cybersecurity]{.underline}**. **[This
requires]{.underline}** closer **[intelligence]{.underline}**,
**[technology]{.underline}**, **[and security partnerships with
countries that share]{.underline}** the **[assessment of the risk of
using untrustworthy]{.underline}** **[Chinese]{.underline}** network
**[technologies]{.underline}**. **[The foundation for this partnership
is]{.underline}** **[the Five Eyes]{.underline}**, **[Nordic
countries]{.underline}**, **[Japan]{.underline}**, **[and]{.underline}**
other **[nations that share our concerns]{.underline}**.

**[Increase federal spending]{.underline}** in support of 5G and 6G.
**[Federal spending on R&D is crucial]{.underline}** in a competition
with China. The private sector already invests heavily in 5G research.
**[The]{.underline}** next **[administration should identity those areas
where there are]{.underline}** R&D **[shortfalls]{.underline}**.
Remedying these shortfalls requires providing substantially more funding

include spectrum sharing, developing new waveforms, and finding new
approaches to 5G security. **[Congress should allocate]{.underline}**
sufficient **[funds for R&D and test beds and encourage collaboration
among]{.underline}** **[government]{.underline}**, service providers,
and cloud service **[providers]{.underline}**.

Congress needs to appropriate funds. Several congressional initiatives
have authorized federal action to accelerate 5G, but they were
unaccompanied by appropriations. These include the Multilateral Telecom
Security Fund to be administered by State Department, the Open Radio
Access Networks (O-RAN) grants program authorized for the National
Telecommunications and Information Agency (NTIA), and the funding of the
CHIPS Act, including funding for federal matching grants and the act's
investment tax credit. These key programs require federal funding to
accelerate adoption and use of 5G in the United States and globally.

**[Safeguard]{.underline}** the international **[standards
process]{.underline}**. **[China has made a wholesale effort to
capture]{.underline}** the **[standards process]{.underline}**. **[While
American and Western companies have held their own]{.underline}**, the
pressure continues. **[The]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[and its partners need to
ensure]{.underline}** the **[independence of the standards
processes]{.underline}**, consider means to promote American attendance
using tax policy or federal support for academic researchers, and remove
impediments that prevent holding standards meetings in the United
States. As part of a new approach to standards, we should avoid a
directive role for government agencies.

**[The]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
**[can manage 5G risk]{.underline}** **[using two sets of policies. The
first is to ensure that American companies can continue to innovate and
produce advanced technologies and face]{.underline}** **[fair
competition overseas.]{.underline}** American and "like-minded"
companies routinely outspend their Chinese competitors in 5G R&D and
hold 10 times as many 5G patents. Chinese companies still depend on the
western companies for the most advanced 5G components.

▪ **[The second is to work with]{.underline}** **[like-minded nations to
develop a common approach]{.underline}** to 5G security. The United
States cannot meet the 5G challenge on its own. When the United States
successfully challenged Chinese industrial policy in the past, it has
been done in concert with allies.

▪ **[Another task will be to find ways to encourage]{.underline}**
undecided **[countries to spend on 5G security]{.underline}**.
**[Huawei's]{.underline}** telecom **[networks cost between 20 to 30
percent less than]{.underline}** competing **[products]{.underline}**.
**[Huawei]{.underline}** also **[offers foreign customers generous terms
for leasing or loans]{.underline}**. **[It can do this because of its
access to]{.underline}** government **[funds]{.underline}**. **[Beijing
supports Huawei for both strategic and commercial
reasons]{.underline}**. **[Many countries]{.underline}** will be
**[tempted by the steep discount]{.underline}**. Not buying Huawei means
paying a "premium" for security to which economic ministries are likely
to object. **[The]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[will need to encourage others to pay
this]{.underline}** security **[premium while at the same time
preparing]{.underline}** for a world **[where the]{.underline}**
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[unavoidably
connects to Huawei]{.underline}**-**[supplied networks
and]{.underline}** determine how to **[securely connect and communicate
over]{.underline}** telecom **[networks]{.underline}** in countries
using Chinese network equipment.

▪ **[The]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[does not need to copy China's]{.underline}**
government-**[centric model for 5G]{.underline}**, **[but it does need
to invest in]{.underline}** **[r]{.underline}**esearch **[and adopt a
comprehensive approach to combatting non-tariff barriers to
trade]{.underline}**. 5G leadership requires a broader technology
competition policy in the United States that builds the engineering and
tech workforce and supports both private and public R&D.
**[The]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
also **[needs to ensure that U.S. companies do not face obstacles from
antitrust or patent infringement investigations undertaken by other
countries]{.underline}** to obtain competitive advantage.

The Russian launch of the world's first manned space flight on April 12,
1961, shook the U.S. to its core. Prior to the launch, [the U.S. and
Russia]{.underline} [had already been engaged]{.underline} [in a
race]{.underline} to space, [but those investments]{.underline} [were
driven]{.underline} [as much by [scientific curiosity as they were
national security](https://blog.tcea.org/space-race/)]{.underline}. But
the Soviet launch put the spotlight on the uncomfortable reality that
the US had fallen far behind in the space race and significant
educational investments were necessary to close the gap. Life magazine,
writing about the state of the US educational system at that time said,
"[The schools are in terrible shape. What has long been an ignored
national problem, Sputnik has made a recognized
crisis](https://books.google.com/books?id=PlYEAAAAMBAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false)."
As a result, in the 20 years after Sputnik, the National Science
Foundation invested five hundred million dollars (in 1960 dollars) into
teacher and classroom development. According to [research from Clemson
University](https://tigerprints.clemson.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2551&context=all_dissertations),
"[by]{.underline} [connecting]{.underline} the [quality of
scientific]{.underline} training to the survival of the nation, [NSF was
able to increase its fellowship budgets]{.underline} [more than 100%
immediately after Sputnik]{.underline}." Congress also passed the
National Defense Education Act which also infused more than a billion
dollars (in 1960 dollars) into science education.

[In an age where the race to AI]{.underline} **[has become a critical
gamechanger]{.underline}**, [we suggest]{.underline} that [China's
emergence]{.underline} as the leader in the race to AI dominance [should
**necessitate** the same **singular national focus**]{.underline} as the
Russian launch of Sputnik in the 1960s. [To produce the
talent]{.underline} [necessary]{.underline} to achieve its national AI
strategies, [the U.S. must **dramatically reinvigorate**]{.underline}
[its approach to STEM education]{.underline} [and force a focus on
computer science at very early ages]{.underline}. [The Computer Science
for All Act of
2021](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3602/text?r=62&s=1),
currently proposed in Congress, is an excellent step in this direction.
[Failure to invest in STEM tech]{.underline}nology [has the potential to
relegate the U.S. to a second-tier nation when it comes to innovation
and the labor force in AI.]{.underline}

[The U.S.]{.underline} [can create a partnership]{.underline} [with a
country]{.underline} [that has an ample supply of talent]{.underline}
(which the U.S. lacks) but who lacks adequate funding (which the U.S.
has in abundance). In this option, we view **[a potential partnership
with India]{.underline}** as a dream scenario. At
present, [[relationships between India and
Chi]{.underline}na](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/08/02/us-india-face-these-5-challenges-can-they-depend-each-other/) [are]{.underline}
**[increasingly frayed]{.underline}** [and India]{.underline} **[is
openly worried]{.underline}** [about an]{.underline} increasingly
[assertive China.]{.underline} [[With the existential threats posed by
China and
Russia](https://www.wsj.com/articles/russia-and-china-dangerous-population-decline-indo-pacific-pivot-research-development-taiwan-ukraine-11639497466) to
the U.S.]{.underline} and India, **[jointly facing a common challenger
may make sense]{.underline}**. As U.S. Secretary of State Anthony

out](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/08/02/us-india-face-these-5-challenges-can-they-depend-each-other/),
"...**[the U.S. has few better options]{.underline}** **[than India for
managing a rising China]{.underline}**."

From an AI standpoint, **[a joint U.S.-India partnership]{.underline}**
[makes a great deal of sense]{.underline}. India produces far more STEM
graduates than the U.S., and the U.S. invests far more in technology
infrastructure than India does[. A U.S.-India partnership]{.underline}
**[eclipses China]{.underline}** [in **both dimensions**]{.underline}
[and a successful partnership]{.underline} [could allow the
U.S.]{.underline} [to quickly leapfrog]{.underline} [China]{.underline}
[in all meaningful aspects of AI.]{.underline}

On April 18, Vice President Kamala
[Harris]{.underline} [[announced](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/04/18/remarks-by-vice-president-harris-on-the-ongoing-work-to-establish-norms-in-space/) a
U.S. commitment]{.underline} **[to forgo]{.underline}** "**[destructive
direct-ascent]{.underline}** **[anti-satellite missile
testing]{.underline}**." [This]{.underline} carefully
[designed]{.underline} [ban]{.underline} [has the potential
to]{.underline} [be the first step]{.underline} [in a new
approach]{.underline} [to security]{.underline} [and sustainability
in]{.underline} [space. If so]{.underline}, [the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates **[will be well-positioned]{.underline}** [to
**ensure peace and prosperity**]{.underline} in space in the emerging
era. However, [if the U.S. continues]{.underline} [its present
course]{.underline}, [it is unlikely to counter]{.underline} [the range
of space]{.underline} [threats]{.underline} [emerging over this decade
and beyond]{.underline}.

To succeed, the new U.S. approach must be characterized by three
elements. 

[First, it must be unilateral]{.underline} [and
multilateral]{.underline}, synthesizing concerns of both hawks and
doves. [The U.S. should]{.underline} continue to [lead the West
in]{.underline} **[seeking multilateral consensus]{.underline}** [on
norms]{.underline} [and agreements]{.underline}, [whether voluntary or
binding]{.underline}, [including]{.underline} [with]{.underline} our
potential [adversaries]{.underline}, **[particularly China and
Russia]{.underline}**. [At the same time]{.underline}, [the U.S. must
employ unilateral measures]{.underline} for several purposes: [to lead
in establishing]{.underline} [new rules and norms]{.underline}, [to
influence other actors']{.underline} incentives toward consensus and
compliance, [and to ensure that deterrence]{.underline} [and crisis
stability]{.underline} hold even if adversaries refuse to join or
subsequently defect from these agreements. [Unfettered freedom of
action]{.underline} [and unilateralism alone]{.underline} **[are
unnecessary]{.underline}** **[and counterproductive,]{.underline}** [but
so is being overly]{.underline} [sanguine about]{.underline} [the intent
of other actors]{.underline} [or beholden to slow]{.underline},
[consensus-driven international forums]{.underline} --- [what is needed
is a careful]{.underline} [synthesis]{.underline} [of both unilateral
and multilateral measures]{.underline}. Russia's invasion of Ukraine and
China's anemic response provides a stark reminder that we cannot rely
solely on agreements nor presume our values are shared.

Second, [it must be nuanced and specific]{.underline}. **[Sweeping,
one-size-fits-all measures are insufficient]{.underline}**;
[instead]{.underline}, [the U.S. **must carefully assess individual
threat vectors**]{.underline} [on a case-by-case]{.underline} [basis and
tailor solutions]{.underline} [to the unique
characteristics]{.underline} [of each specific threat]{.underline}. 

[Third, it must be timely]{.underline}. [Preventing]{.underline},
[deterring]{.underline}, [and managing these threats]{.underline} [will
require putting]{.underline} [in place appropriate legal
frameworks]{.underline}, [policies, doctrine, and
tech]{.underline}nological [capabilities]{.underline} [well in
advance]{.underline} --- a process that takes years. Therefore, delay is
untenable. As Gen. John Hyten, the former Strategic Command and Air
Force Space Command
chief, [noted](https://spacenews.com/hyten-blasts-unbelievably-slow-dod-bureaucracy-as-china-advances-space-weapons/) shortly
before his 2021 retirement as vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, "the DoD is still unbelievably bureaucratic and slow" in its
response to China's rapidly advancing space weapons. He advised his
successor to "reinsert speed into the process."

Fortunately, Vice President Harris's ban and recent comments made by
other top space officials hint at a possible embrace of all three
elements. 

In December,
[Harris]{.underline} [[tasked]{.underline}](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/04/18/fact-sheet-vice-president-harris-advances-national-security-norms-in-space/) [the
National Space Council]{.underline}, National Security Council,
Department of Defense, Department of State, [and other agencies to
collaborate on proposals]{.underline} [to]{.underline} "**[advance U.S.
interests and preserve the security and sustainability of
space]{.underline}**." Harris's April 18 moratorium on debris-producing,
direct-ascent anti-satellite (DA-ASAT) tests
was [identified](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/04/18/fact-sheet-vice-president-harris-advances-national-security-norms-in-space/) by
the accompanying White House fact sheet as the "first initiative" of
many under this broader effort. The White House statement further
clarified the Biden administration's priorities, [declaring that
"developing a shared]{.underline} [understanding]{.underline} [of what
constitutes]{.underline} [safe]{.underline} [and responsible
space]{.underline} [activities]{.underline} [contributes **to a more
stable space environment**]{.underline} [by reducing]{.underline} the
risk of [miscommunication and miscalculation]{.underline}." It also said
[the U.S. will "**uphold and strengthen a rules-based international
order** for space,"]{.underline} [and]{.underline} that by "[working
with commercial industry]{.underline}, [allies, and
partners]{.underline}, \[[the U.S]{.underline}.\] **[will lead in the
development]{.underline}** of new measures [that contribute to the
safety]{.underline}, [stability, security, and long-term sustainability
of space activities."]{.underline}

[Tweaking Missile Defenses]{.underline}

Saltzman addressed speculation that Chinese testing this summer,
reported in October, could have been of a [nuclear first-strike
weapon](https://www.airforcemag.com/us-catching-up-to-do-hypersonic-missile-space-force/),
saying it **[is "front and center]{.underline}** because this is a very
forward-edge technology capability," in part because it likely can stay
in orbit for long periods. However, he cautioned, "the words that we use
are important so that we understand exactly what we're talking about
here. I hear things like hypersonic missile, and I hear suborbital
sometimes, and so this is a categorically different system." 

For one thing, [space objects have]{.underline} "[inherent overflight
capabilities]{.underline}" [and the proposition "that you could
routinely orbit a nuclear weapon over a country."]{.underline} Analysts
frequently point out that the Space Force's X-37B autonomous spaceplane
[amounts to the same thing.]{.underline}

[In terms of detecting such a weapon]{.underline} that can go into orbit
then deorbit, his point was that [it's not a ballistic missile with a
predictable trajectory]{.underline}. 

["A lot of our warning]{.underline} [is based on ballistic
missiles]{.underline} [because that's been the primary threat for so
many years]{.underline}," Saltzman said. "[So it's incumbent on the
Space Force, in my mind, to make sure that **we're developing the
capabilities** **to track these kind of weapons**---**before they're
launched**, ideally,]{.underline} but then throughout their life cycle,
either on orbit or in execution of their mission set. 

"And [**if we can track, we can attribute**. And if we can
attribute]{.underline}, I think **[we can deter]{.underline}**," he
added.

Saltzman hinted at one way the Space Force might advance its ability to
track in a discussion of defending against Russia's long-range cruise
missiles. 

["**We own a great number of radars**]{.underline} [that provide missile
warning]{.underline}. **[We own overhead capabilities]{.underline}**
[from an \[infrared\] standpoint that]{.underline} [can track some of
these capabilities]{.underline}," he said. 

"So it's incumbent on us to make sure we get the most out of those
sensors to be able to maybe use them in a way they weren't designed. We
have a long history of this. [We've gotten]{.underline} [the most out of
our systems because]{.underline} **[we have some really talented
engineers]{.underline}** [that can change the way data is
fused]{.underline} [on the ground and actually pull more information out
of the sensor data that we collect. So when we see a new threat, we
immediately start pouring resources and brainpower into
it."]{.underline}

[The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [should]{.underline} be

using]{.underline} [their space-based capabilities]{.underline} [without
transforming them]{.underline} [into hazards that could impede
American]{.underline}, [allied, and]{.underline} [commercial space
operations]{.underline}. [Using non-kinetic space weapons]{.underline}
**[has long been on the minds]{.underline}** of senior national security
officials. When Ford authorized the development of a new kinetic
anti-satellite system in 1977, he
also [called](https://aerospace.org/sites/default/files/policy_archives/NSDM-345%20ASAT%20Jan77.pdf) for
"a non-nuclear anti-satellite capability, including means for electronic
nullification." Today, [the emphasis should only be non-kinetic weapons
with reversible effects.]{.underline}

[Most importantly]{.underline}, the [objectives]{.underline} [of
the Defense Space Strategy can be achieved through]{.underline} the
**[use of non-kinetic space weapons]{.underline}** [like the Space

Eric

[The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and Europe]{.underline}
[have already **implemented a large-scale campaign**]{.underline} [of
diplomatic **isolation**]{.underline} [and economic
pressure]{.underline} [against Russia]{.underline} and allocated
unprecedented military aid to Ukraine in response to Moscow's unprovoked
invasion --- yet so far, these steps have not fundamentally changed
Putin's calculus. [A response to cyberattacks that relies
on]{.underline} [those same tools]{.underline} [to]{.underline}
incrementally [increase]{.underline} the [economic and military
pain]{.underline} to the Russians [is]{.underline} likewise [unlikely to
cause the Kremlin to stop.]{.underline}

Unlike sanctions or kinetic attacks, [a carefully executed
cyberattack]{.underline} on specific targets **[is relatively easy to
implement]{.underline}** and, more importantly, easy to end without
causing lasting damage. Assuming the initial Russian actions do not lead
to loss of life --- if they did, then expect Washington to take the
gloves off --- [it would be beneficial]{.underline} [for the United
States to]{.underline} [tailor]{.underline} [a response]{.underline}
[that can provide a **powerful demonstration**]{.underline} to the
Kremlin of U.S. capabilities [but avoid widespread
destruction]{.underline} [that could lead to escalation]{.underline}.
[Combined with a clear]{.underline} **[public and private
message]{.underline}** that the United States [will go much further in
the cyber arena]{.underline} if Russia attacks again, [such a move
**would demonstrate America's resolve** while creating an off-ramp for
Moscow to end its cyber aggression.]{.underline}

[One]{.underline} such measured [response]{.underline} [could be a cyber
operation that]{.underline} **[causes a widespread --- but brief ---
disruption]{.underline}** [to Internet service]{.underline} across
Russia. [Such an attack]{.underline}, which is well within the
capabilities of the U.S. Cyber Command, [would provide a powerful
example]{.underline} [of what the United States can]{.underline} do. It
would also show Kremlin leadership what life would be like for
government officials, businesses and regular citizens alike without
Internet connectivity. Like all advanced economies, Russia is dependent
on the Internet, and even temporary connectivity disruptions --- lasting
an hour or two at most --- would affect every sector of the Russian
economy, from energy to media to national defense. And yet a short
disruption that does not cause permanent damage would be less likely to
generate further escalation.

[This approach is no surefire bulwark]{.underline} [against a second
Russian attack]{.underline}, [which would warrant a broader and more
devastating course of action]{.underline}. But it does create an
opportunity to avoid an escalation spiral. Because Russia is likely to
view its initial cyberattacks as a vindicable counter to Western
sanctions, [a more destructive U.S. response could prompt Putin **to
double down.**]{.underline}

[Russia appears poised]{.underline} [to make a first move]{.underline}
[against the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and its allies in
cyberspace.]{.underline} [A savvy U.S. response that is deliberately
measured and accompanied by the right message could end this fight after
the first round.]{.underline}

The first invasion by Russia was not dispatching his military into
Ukraine. It was the malignant propaganda the Kremlin skillfully deployed
to poison public opinion in the U.S. and Europe. The Biden
administration --- specifically Attorney General Merrick Garland ---
should now enforce a longstanding law requiring that propaganda from
hostile foreign governments be labeled as such so that Americans know
who's feeding them the news. Silicon Valley should atone for its role as
Putin's long-time enabler by pledging to give users the information they
need to know when they see propaganda in their social media feeds and
search results.

[Russian falsehoods]{.underline} about its role in Syria, American
bioweapons and Ukraine reached millions of people in Western
democracies, including through Facebook, Google, YouTube, TikTok and
Twitter. Moscow myths included that Ukraine politics is dominated by
Nazis (reported by Russian government sites RT and TASS), that the
government in Kyiv committed genocide against ethnic Russians in its
Donbas region (Sputnik News and TASS) and that Western governments
staged the coup in 2014 that led to the resignation of Ukraine's
pro-Russian president (RT and Sputnik News). [This
disinformation]{.underline} **[continues to find an
audience]{.underline}** [in the U.S]{.underline}. [and
Europe]{.underline} [and is being [repeated
by](https://www.brookings.edu/techstream/popular-podcasters-spread-russian-disinformation-about-ukraine-biolabs/)]{.underline} [far-right
and far-left commentators]{.underline}. The Kremlin seeks a moral
equivalence between Moscow and Washington, hoping to undermine Western
resolve to defend Ukraine.

Since Stalin, [the Russian government]{.underline} has
[used]{.underline} [dezinformatsiya]{.underline} [as the spear tip of
its foreign policy]{.underline}. [What's changed]{.underline} [is that
the internet]{.underline} now [provides Moscow]{.underline} [with an
enormous]{.underline} [distribution network]{.underline} [and even
revenue opportunities]{.underline} [for its efforts]{.underline} ---
[and]{.underline} that [the U.S. no longer enforces]{.underline}
[disclosure requirements for foreign propaganda]{.underline}.

The Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) was created in the 1930s to
counter Nazi propaganda by requiring distributors in the U.S. to
disclose the nature of the source. Pamphlets and magazines sent from
hostile foreign governments were required to be labeled, such as with a
stamp added by the distributor indicating that the organization behind
the propaganda was a registered foreign agent. In introducing the law in
1937, [Rep. John McCormack
explained](https://www.salon.com/2018/12/21/it-started-with-nazis-concerns-over-foreign-agents-not-just-a-trump-era-phenomenon_partner/) this
would ensure Americans knew Nazi propaganda when they saw it: "The
passage of this bill will label such propaganda just as the law requires
us to label poison." The House Judiciary Committee [report on the
proposed
law](https://www.caplindrysdale.com/files/24384_h._rep._no._75-1381_1937.pdf) said,
"The spotlight of pitiless publicity will serve as a deterrent to the
spread of pernicious propaganda."

[The U.S.]{.underline} [continued to enforce]{.underline} the [labeling
requirement]{.underline} through the Cold War. Magazines such as Soviet
Life came with warnings stamped on them by distributors alerting readers
that the publisher was an agent of Moscow.

[Russian disinformation]{.underline} websites [were [required to
register with the Justice
Department](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-propaganda/u-s-based-russian-news-outlet-registers-as-foreign-agent-idUSKCN1G201H)]{.underline} under
FARA during the Trump administration, but the attorneys general under
several presidents have failed to update [the law's labeling
requirements](https://www.justice.gov/nsd-fara/frequently-asked-questions#46) for
the internet. (FARA gives the attorney general discretion to update how
FARA's broad rules are applied.) [The]{.underline} [modern
equivalent]{.underline} [of a stamp in every copy of a
pamphlet]{.underline} paid for by the Nazi or Soviet government [would
be a detailed disclosure]{.underline} [included in every
article]{.underline} [or video from the Kremlin]{.underline} that
appeared in anyone's social media feed or search result.

[Instead of updating FARA]{.underline}, over the past few years [there
have been calls to dilute the law]{.underline} as an outdated relic of
the Cold War. Russia's invasion of Ukraine is a forceful reminder why
the kind of disclosure required by FARA matters. To its credit, the
Federal Communications Commission invoked the invasion to [start
requiring broadcasters to
disclose](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-broadcasting-foreign-idCAKCN2LC1QL) when
a foreign government has paid to distribute its propaganda, but no such
rules are being applied online. Twitter on its own has at least started
to identify some Russian disinformation sources as "state affiliated" in
tweets, but this provides readers with limited information. (Meanwhile,
Putin began requiring labeling of all Radio Free Europe and Radio
Liberty stories on the web in Russia in 2020, [which led to more than
\$13 million in
fines](https://www.usagm.gov/2022/01/11/russia-intensifies-attacks-on-rfe-rl/#:~:text=RFE%2FRL%20now%20faces%20a,(ECHR)%20over%20the%20law.) for
non-compliance by the U.S. sources.)

**[Labeling through extensive disclosure]{.underline}** [is more
practical]{.underline} [on the internet]{.underline} than in print or
through broadcasts, [where space is limited]{.underline}. [Disclosures
online]{.underline} [can be detailed enough to give readers]{.underline}
**[all the information]{.underline}** [they need to decide how
trustworthy]{.underline} [to consider a source]{.underline}. My analyst
colleagues at NewsGuard often write "**[Nutrition Labels" for news
sites]{.underline}** in the thousands of words, with numerous citations,
to explain why sites like RT and Sputnik News fail basic criteria of
journalistic practice and differ fundamentally from government news
sources with effective independent charters such as the BBC. Microsoft
makes NewsGuard's detailed ratings and reviews of news websites
available to its users, [but the other]{.underline} [large
platforms]{.underline} [don't yet provide this kind of transparency to
their users]{.underline}. And labels work: Gallup research found that
when given access to apolitical source ratings, [a [majority of
readers](https://www.newsguardtech.com/press/gallup-research-finds-newsguard-ratings-of-news-websites-effective-in-countering-false-information-misinformation-and-disinformation/)]{.underline} [became
less likely to believe]{.underline} [or share news]{.underline} [from
websites rated untrustworthy]{.underline} [and more likely to believe
and share news from websites rated trustworthy]{.underline}.

Joshua Geltzer, who is now on the staff of the National Security
Council, has argued for more disclosure (though not specifically through
FARA), writing on [the Just Security website in
2018](https://www.justsecurity.org/61908/extraordinary-lesson-reports-russian-disinformation-reveal-white-house-paralysis/):
"[The spread of disinformation]{.underline} [is the rare

The Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA), a law passed in 1938 in
response to Nazi propaganda, provides a framework to promote
transparency regarding the sources of information available to the
American public. However, many of the rules created by the law are
antiquated, and FARA must be reformed to ensure that all agents of
foreign adversaries, including such media organizations, register. In
the last Congress, Representative (and CSC Co-Chair) Mike Gallagher
(R-Wisc) proposed the Chinese Communist Party Influence Transparency
Act, which would require all Chinese corporations to register under
FARA. Congress should look at expanding this effort to include
corporations domiciled in other adversaries like Russia and Iran. In
addition, Congress should amend the definition of "informational
materials," which registered foreign agents are required to both label
as such and report to the Department of Justice, in FARA to make clear
that social media and email communications are included. In addition,
Congress should provide greater specificity regarding the types of
social media and email communications that need to be included in FARA
filings to ensure that the Department of Justice adopts a records system
that better captures the dynamism and interactiveness of digital media
and communications, allowing, for example, for social media posts filed
to be maintained along with, for example, comments on or replies to a
post,  while preserving appropriate privacy protections.

Combatting disinformation also requires imposing costs on adversaries
responsible for influence operations -- what the CSC refers to as a
strategy of layered cyber deterrence in the information landscape. For
example, the U.S. government should continue to engage in robust "defend
forward" operations to dismantle adversary disinformation infrastructure
and cause friction in adversary disinformation campaigns, as it did,
for [example](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-cyber-command-operation-disrupted-internet-access-of-russian-troll-factory-on-day-of-2018-midterms/2019/02/26/1827fc9e-36d6-11e9-af5b-b51b7ff322e9_story.html),
with the Internet Research Agency around the 2018 midterm election.

Eric

On the issue of social media, for example, the CSC and Aspen agree that
the federal government should push for greater transparency on how
social media platforms sort, moderate, and
remove [content](https://www.justsecurity.org/tag/content-moderation/) on
their platforms. The unique position of platforms in the information
ecosystem allots them an outsized opportunity to exert positive
influence over the media and information environment. But rather than
trying to regulate content on these social media platforms, lawmakers
and regulators should endeavor to establish clearer transparency
expectations and guidelines for social media companies related to
labeling advertisements and paid content, bots, and content created by
foreign registered agents. In addition, the two commissions argue that
the federal government should work with social media companies so that
the American public better understands the various platforms' policies
on content moderation and takedowns.

In addition, both the CSC and the Aspen Commission agree that Congress
should take action to ensure that third-party researchers can access
data to better understand, identify, and -- most importantly -- explain
foreign disinformation campaigns to the American public. The federal
government could support these research efforts through grants to
nonprofit centers, such as the Alliance for Securing Democracy's
Hamilton 2.0 dashboard and the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic
Research Lab.

Finally, both the CSC and the Aspen Commission identify the importance
of civic empowerment and education. In keeping with this conviction, the
CSC recommends the creation of a bipartisan Civic Education Task Force
to enable greater access to civic education resources, and raise public
awareness about foreign disinformation. The task force should be tasked
with providing civic education resources, including courses and course
materials, for the military and civil servants, all while making these
materials available to the broader population.

Beyond these shared recommendations, the CSC advocates for some
additional approaches to counter foreign disinformation.

[McKinney and Harris]{.underline} [believe]{.underline} that
[deterrence]{.underline} [by denial]{.underline} [will
fail,]{.underline} [but deterrence by **punishment**]{.underline}
**[will succeed]{.underline}**. It seems that at a certain point in
time, [any of the U.S. deterrence]{.underline} [strategies]{.underline}
in stopping the occurrence of a war over the Taiwan Strait [may very
likely be destined to fail]{.underline}. This assessment is predicated
on not only China promoting a nationalist dogma, but also the structural
development in China's growing ambitions and modernization of its
military strength. [It is not about whether]{.underline}
[China]{.underline} [would want to use its force against
Taiwan]{.underline}, [but when China]{.underline}---under CPC
rule---[will feel that the conditions]{.underline} [are conducive to
doing]{.underline} so. However, it would be a misconception to quickly
equate U.S. "strategic clarity" to a great power war as McKinney and
Harris maintained.

As exemplified by the Russia-Ukraine war, while the United States and
NATO are undecided to confront Russia directly, there are indirect ways
that the international community could provide continuous support to
Ukraine without creating an escalated conflict. The objective of
traditional deterrence is to prevent a war---not to win a war.
Nevertheless, deterrence across the Taiwan Strait may be less about
stopping the CPC's ambitions, but more about prolonging the war and
deterring the People's Liberation Army's triphibious invasion.

In that situation, [China now has two aircraft carriers]{.underline}
[and five new theater commands.]{.underline} Since its 2016 military
reforms, it could
be[ expected](https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202009/1200845.shtml) that
an invasion of Taiwan would certainly be a conflict involving military
assets beyond the Taiwan Strait, but including assets from the Bohai
Sea, Yellow Sea, East China Sea, and the South China Sea. Henceforth, a
robust Taiwanese defense (i.e., a "[porcupine
strategy](https://tnsr.org/2021/12/a-large-number-of-small-things-a-porcupine-strategy-for-taiwan/)")
would be better to complement, but not
to[ replace](https://en.csstw.org/events_detail/4.htm) Taiwan's
offensive fighting capability[. A strategy of sustaining]{.underline}
[Taiwan's fighting]{.underline} [capability]{.underline} [and enlarging
the conflict area]{.underline}---**[with U.S.
support]{.underline}**---[would allow Taiwan]{.underline} **[to create
more political leverage]{.underline}** **[and cost]{.underline}**
[against China]{.underline} [while the economic activities]{.underline}
in southeast China [would likely be depressed]{.underline} [due to
concerns about the ongoing war]{.underline}. [It would place immediate
economic and political pressure on China's invasion. This improved
design follows McKinney and Harris' strategy in principle, but uses
different tactics in a new security context over the Taiwan
Strait.]{.underline}

Works?" Cato Institute. 02-08-2017.
https://www.cato.org/blog/nato-burden-sharing //EM

President Donald **[Trump]{.underline}** has **[repeatedly complained
that the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[carries too much of the economic
and]{.underline}** **[military burden in NATO]{.underline}**. **[He
has]{.underline}** even **[gone so far as to call the European alliance
"obsolete" and to suggest that his administration might not
fulfill]{.underline}** the treaty's **[A]{.underline}**rticle
**[5]{.underline}** obligation that commits NATO countries to come to
the defense of any member that is attacked (Note: administration
officials have repeatedly sought to reassure NATO allies that we remain
committed to the collective defense of Europe, and Trump has
contradicted himself on this score).

Many think this provocative rhetoric is just a ploy to get our NATO
allies, who habitually underspend on defense and free‐​ride on America's
security guarantees, to pay more of their fair share of the burden. At
the Washington Post's Monkey Cage blog, **[Andrea Gilli argues this
approach is unlikely to jolt NATO allies into spending more on
defense]{.underline}**, though. Among other reasons, most NATO allies
"face financial and political constraints to increasing military
expenditure" in part because U.S. security assurances "have freed up
state funds in Europe for other priorities, including a robust system of
social services." And since cutting welfare benefits is typically a
political non‐​starter, we shouldn't necessarily expect NATO countries to
boost defense spending due to Trump's abrasive rhetoric.

**[But the historical record seems to contradict Gilli's
argument]{.underline}**. According to the RAND Corporation, **[Europe
has historically spent between 43 percent and 78 percent of U.S.
spending]{.underline}** on defense. **[The ratio reached its peak in
1980,]{.underline}** **[and then again in 2000]{.underline}** ---
**[years that were at the tail end of periods of]{.underline}** defense
budget **[cuts]{.underline}**. And according to the RAND report, **[one
of the the most successful techniques in getting]{.underline}** **[NATO
allies to share more]{.underline}** of the **[burden was "threats by
Congress to withdraw its troops]{.underline}** from Europe."

The only period of signficant real growth in European defense spending
was during the 1970s; otherwise European defense expenditure has been
remarkably flat in real terms...

Certainly other factors contributed to this period of growth in NATO
burden sharing --- higher rates of economic growth, increased
perceptions of the Soviet threat, defense budget cuts as we withdrew
from Vietnam, etc. But **[U.S. threats to pare back its
commitment]{.underline}** to the region **[seem to have had a

7 Conclusion

This article presented a theory of coercive burden-sharing in asymmetric
alliances. I argued that **[allies are more likely to
increase]{.underline}** their **[defense spending]{.underline}** **[when
their patron]{.underline}** can more **[credibly threaten to abandon
them.]{.underline}** Specifically, **[allies are likely to contribute to
the alliance when]{.underline}** their **[patron faces
constraints]{.underline}** **[on its resources that make it difficult to
sustain]{.underline}** its foreign **[commitments]{.underline}**, while
allies are less likely to burden-share when they are more strategically
valuable to their patron, as this reduces its ability to threaten
abandonment. Moreover, **[the patron's threats of abandonment are more
salient to the extent that allies]{.underline}** **[have a high
perception of threat]{.underline}**, **[which renders them
in]{.underline}** greater **[need of protection]{.underline}**. I
**[tested these claims using data on the]{.underline}** military
**[expenditures of U.S. allies]{.underline}** **[between 1950 and
2012]{.underline}**. My findings show that U.S. **[allies vulnerable to
attack spend more on defense,]{.underline}** while strategically
valuable allies near key maritime chokepoints spend less. Additionally,
**[allies]{.underline}** are **[more likely to increase
their]{.underline}** defense **[spending when the]{.underline}**
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[faces resource
constraints and]{.underline}** **[pressure to retrench]{.underline}** in
the wake of costly foreign wars.

My findings suggest numerous avenues for future research. For one,
although this study focuses primarily on the effectiveness of negative
inducements -- and in particular threats of abandonment -- as means of
exerting burden-sharing pressure, further research could investigate the
effectiveness of other forms of persuasion. These include but are not
limited to economic coercion, promises of rewards and positive
inducements, and efforts to "name and shame" states that
under-contribute to their alliances. Additionally, more research could
be done on the conditions under which burdensharing is a salient
political issue to domestic actors, as well as how much burden-sharing
is "enough" to deter major calls for putting pressure on allies. Work on
political psychology, for example, could provide micro-foundations to
help understand demands for "fairness."

Finally, my findings have implications for U.S. foreign policy. The
Trump administration has made burden-sharing a major priority, and to
this end U.S. officials -- not least of all Trump himself -- have
pressed allies to contribute more to the common defense, using implicit
and often explicit threats of abandonment. Indeed, **[there is some
evidence that this has been effective]{.underline}**, **[with NATO
allies agreeing to increase their]{.underline}** defense **[spending by
an average of 4.3% in 2017]{.underline}**.149 Nevertheless, the findings
presented here suggest that the effectiveness of U.S. pressure is likely
to be shaped by both allies' perception of threat and by the extent to
which the United States faces resource constraints.

**[Within NATO]{.underline}**, **[only the]{.underline}**
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
**[maintains]{.underline}** and controls the conventional and **[nuclear
capacity to deter]{.underline}** **[and defend against existential
threats]{.underline}** to the alliance. **[No other ally has the
expeditionary military capacity to do so]{.underline}**. For example,
Estonia is not worried about being abandoned by Romania, Portugal, or
even Germany, knowing none of them could bring a sizable military force
to bear in response to a Russian invasion or fait accompli. In this
case, Estonia's **[chief concern revolves around the]{.underline}**
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tate**[s']{.underline}**
**[guarantee of their sovereignty through NATO]{.underline}**. Suppose
the United States can make credible claims that it is willing to abandon
an ally and not fulfill its treaty obligations. In that case, the ally
will experience a drastic incentive to increase its military
capabilities to defend itself.

**[It may seem that these]{.underline}** tensions and **[fears will only
lead to negative outcomes]{.underline}**, **[but some
disunity]{.underline}** within an alliance **[can yield positive
results]{.underline}**. **[Several]{.underline}** **[articles
researching]{.underline}** the implications of **[free-riding and
burdening-sharing]{.underline}** in alliances **[have supported this
notion]{.underline}**. In Olson and Zeckhauser's seminal article on
burden-sharing, they wrote, "This fact leads to the paradoxical
conclusion that a decline in the amity, unity, and community of interest
among allies need not necessarily reduce the effectiveness of an
alliance..." and "**[The]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates, at least, **[should perhaps not hope for too
much unity in common]{.underline}** **[ventures]{.underline}** with
other nations. **[It might prove extremely expensive]{.underline}**."
Similarly, Plumper and Neumayer note in reference to the smaller allies
(non-US allies), "Unless the interests of alliance members are
independent, the existence of NATO allows the smaller allies to
free-ride to some extent."

Moreover, **[the breakdown of unity]{.underline}** in the alliance
**[caused by the Trump administration demands has
compelled]{.underline}** European **[allies to take a larger role in
their]{.underline}** **[defense]{.underline}**. The former German
Ambassador to the United States, Peter Wittig, described the Trump
administration's approach as a "healthy wakeup call for the
Europeans...to not free-ride." Currently, the leaders of NATO
member-states feel they cannot rely on the United States as the sole
guarantor of Europe's security. Back in 2017, German Chancellor Angela
Merkel stated, "We Europeans truly have to take our fate into our own
hands" and, "**[We can't rely on the superpower of the]{.underline}**
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates." A year later, French
President Emmanuel Macron reinforced this sentiment declaring, "It is up
to us today to take our responsibilities and guarantee our own security,
and thus have European sovereignty." More recently, in response to the
planned troop withdrawal announced this past summer, the German Defense
Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer called the move "regrettable" and
noted, "The truth is that a good life in Germany and Europe depends more
and more on how we ensure our security ourselves."

"[Bad cop" for]{.underline} [allies]{.underline}. The [function of
**critiquing undesirable actions**]{.underline} [extends to foreign
nations]{.underline}. [Congress]{.underline} frequently [serves as a
**useful source of pressure**]{.underline} [on other
countries]{.underline}, [**drawing attention** to]{.underline}
[problematic behavior]{.underline} [and **opening the door** for the
executive branch]{.underline} [**to follow up with negotiations** or
other measures.]{.underline}

When it comes to NATO, [Congress]{.underline} has [played the "bad
cop"]{.underline} [most frequently]{.underline} [in]{.underline} the
area of **[burden-sharing]{.underline}**. [Members]{.underline}
[routinely **put pressure on allies**]{.underline} [to increase
their]{.underline} [contributions]{.underline} to the alliance, [which
gives **executive-branch negotiators political cover**]{.underline} [to
make the same demand because they can claim Congress is tying their
hands]{.underline}. NATO expert Stanley Sloan is worth quoting at length
on the history of congressional involvement in burden-sharing: **[From
the very beginning]{.underline}**, [the congressional
partner]{.underline} [regularly raised]{.underline}
[questions]{.underline} [about the persistent burden-sharing
issue]{.underline}. This questioning began with the initial debate in
the Senate on whether it should give its advice and consent to the
Treaty. The administration of President Harry Truman reassured senators
that the European allies would contribute to their own defense and that
the United States would not end up carrying a disproportionate share of
the burden. [As the European states]{.underline} [recovered from the
devastation of World War II]{.underline}, some [senators]{.underline}
[argued that the Europeans had become capable of]{.underline} [defending
themselves]{.underline}. Montana's Senator Mike Mansfield (D) famously
promoted resolutions from the mid-1960s into the early 1970s that sought
to force administrations to begin withdrawing US forces from Europe.
[While US administrations]{.underline}---**[Democratic and
Republican]{.underline}**---**[sought to contain the financial
burdens]{.underline}** **[and to get the Europeans to compensate the
United States for some of NATO's costs]{.underline}**, the established
pattern persisted into the post-- Cold War years. Over all these years[,
Congress d**id most of the complaining**]{.underline} while successive
presidents of both parties urged allies to do more but largely defended
the alliance and its costs as necessary for US national interests
\[emphasis added\]. 53 [Interviewees with experience]{.underline} [in
the executive branch repeatedly]{.underline} [told me that
**congressional "complaining" or "needling,**]{.underline}" sometimes
seen as unproductive grandstanding, [is actually a **useful way to
pressure allies** and get issues on the agenda]{.underline}.54 To be
sure, congressional critiques can also cause headaches for the executive
branch if they create diplomatic friction. Interviewees emphasized the
need for useful [congressional pressure]{.underline} [that is
coordinated with the executive]{.underline} and stops short of
disrupting fragile bilateral relationships.

Relationships abroad: Closely related, [members of
**Congress**]{.underline} [and congressional staff **have strong
relationships**]{.underline} [with representatives of foreign
governments]{.underline}. One staffer argued that [congressional
relationships]{.underline} with foreign dignitaries **[are
underused]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} that **[behind-the-scenes
diplomacy]{.underline}** with members of Congress **[can have an
important impact]{.underline}**.75 [Foreign dignitaries]{.underline}
[are]{.underline} often **[eager to engage]{.underline}**
[with]{.underline} members of [Congress]{.underline}, **[which is a
source of legislative strength]{.underline}**.76 Again, however, there's
a balance to be struck, as interviewees emphasized that the executive
branch should retain the lead in diplomatic negotiations. Travel: An
important part of congressional relationships with foreign counterparts
is travel. Many experts argued that members of [Congress can have a
significant impact by traveling to a NATO-related location and meeting
with stakeholders]{.underline}. 77 Lawmakers sometimes travel with
congressional delegations (CODELs) to places like NATO headquarters in
Brussels and the Munich Security Conference. CODELs offer a chance
[to]{.underline} **[communicate American priorities]{.underline}** to
foreign governments[, **including** wielding threats of **punitive
action if a country is seen as not cooperating**]{.underline}.78 To be
sure, it's difficult to get members on these trips, in part because
traveling to seemingly glamorous places like Europe may come off to
constituents as spending taxpayer dollars on a luxurious getaway.79 More
generally, NATO is low on the list of places that are worth members'
limited time. Still, members should note that travel offers a way to
have a big impact, particularly on foreign governments.

[Congress retains **significant influence on**]{.underline} **[foreign
policy]{.underline}** [despite today's constrained
environment]{.underline} and the executive branch's general dominance of
this area. Notably, [most of these avenues of influence **can be pursued
in a highly partisan climate**]{.underline}. [Initiatives like
spotlighting rights abuses abroad]{.underline}, [critiquing the
executive branch]{.underline}, [and interacting with allies **often have
bipartisan support**]{.underline}, [while tactics like private
conversations]{.underline} [with foreign counterparts and statements to
the media **do not require reaching across the aisle at
all.80**]{.underline}

Perhaps most importantly, [many of the legislature's most
important]{.underline} [channels of influence are informal ones,
largely]{.underline} [separate from the formal]{.underline},
[constitutional powers]{.underline} [that today's]{.underline}
[Congress]{.underline} [often struggles to exercise]{.underline}.
Indeed, [Congress wields influence]{.underline} [even when it does not
pass legislation]{.underline}. As James Lindsay wrote three decades ago:
...focusing on the legislative track record captures only part of the
story. [Congress influences policy **through several indirect means**:
**anticipated reactions**, **changes in the decision-making process** in
the executive branch, **and political grandstanding**. Indeed, the same
factors that frustrate congressional attempts to lead on foreign affairs
encourage legislators to use indirect means to influence
policy.81]{.underline}

Today, [these indirect means]{.underline} [may be even more
important]{.underline}. This section has found that [Congress **does
have a role to play**]{.underline} [on day-to-day foreign policy issues
like alliance management, and that the legislative branch remains
relevant despite the institutional and political constraints that hamper
its governing capacity.]{.underline}

#### Threatening allies works -- Congress has significant leverage.

**[Calling out wrongdoing]{.underline}**. First, [Congress]{.underline}
[is especially well-suited to]{.underline} **[vocally and
forcefully]{.underline}** [critiquing bad behavior]{.underline} [by
other actors **at home or abroad**]{.underline}. As [the
branch]{.underline} of government that **[represents the American
public]{.underline}**, [Congress]{.underline} has [long embraced a duty
to **investigate wrongdoing**]{.underline} within the broader
constitutional system of checks and balances. 44 [More
generally]{.underline}, [it derives **unique legitimacy**]{.underline}
[from its role as the voice of the people]{.underline} [and the body
that **ultimately determines** whether a policy can be
backed]{.underline} [by funds.]{.underline} 45 As Richard Fontaine, a
former foreign policy advisor to Sen. John McCain, put it, "[They have
**institutional authority and power**]{.underline} [that doesn't exist
**anywhere else**]{.underline} in government, [from the power of the
purse]{.underline} [to the confirmation process]{.underline} [to other
forms of power and leverage."]{.underline}46

[Lawmakers]{.underline} have [added incentives to engage in
"callouts]{.underline}" [because fighting unethical]{.underline} [or
unlawful behavior]{.underline} [plays well with
constituents]{.underline} and [in the media]{.underline}. In addition,
[the **sheer size** of]{.underline} [Congress]{.underline} [creates
a]{.underline} messiness that lends itself to the **[calling-out
function]{.underline}**: [It is much **easier to get a group of
lawmakers**]{.underline} [with different interests **to agree on
criticizing** **something**]{.underline} than on, say, proposing a new
initiative.

#### Through narrative shaping, hearings, and reporting requirements, they can easily influence allies.

[Influencing]{.underline} [the executive agenda]{.underline} [and
shaping the narrative]{.underline}: A third set of strengths has to do
with Congress' ability to [**put priorities** on]{.underline} [the
executive branch's]{.underline} [agenda]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
generally [**shape** the **domestic and international
narrative**]{.underline} **[around particular issues]{.underline}**.60
[These strengths]{.underline}, which are closely related to the
"**[calling out wrongdoing]{.underline}**" idea, similarly [stem from
Congress' status]{.underline} as the representative of the American
people, [which endows its priorities **with a unique
legitimacy.**]{.underline}

[Narrative-shaping]{.underline} [through hearings and more]{.underline}:
[Congressional attention]{.underline} [to a given foreign policy
priority can **significantly influence the debate**]{.underline} **[over
that issue at home and abroad]{.underline}**. [Interviewees]{.underline}
[who have worked]{.underline} in the executive branch and [with
NATO]{.underline} [agreed]{.underline} that both **[actors pay close
attention to what happens in Congress]{.underline}**. As Fontaine and
Schulman argue, "[Congress can play a vital role in **encouraging,
convening, and organizing public** and alternative **sources of
information**]{.underline}."61 For instance, they argue that
[congressional hearings]{.underline} [can **uncover** new
issues]{.underline} [or **new ways of thinking** about old
issues]{.underline}. 62 Nicholas Burns, former U.S. ambassador to NATO,
told me that calling [a hearing]{.underline} "**[shines a bright
light]{.underline}** [on a big issue]{.underline}\...[It's a convening
power]{.underline} [to ask members]{.underline} of the administration to
appear before Congress and [to engage in conversation]{.underline} [and
debate]{.underline} [about]{.underline} the administration\'s
[policies]{.underline}."63 As a 2018 Foreign Affairs article noted,
"Hearings and investigations draw attention to neglected issues and can
force administrations to rethink decisions. They can divert the
executive branch from its priorities and focus the attention of the
press."64

The same applies to other non-legislative tools such as requests for
briefings, resolutions, letters to the president and Cabinet officials,
floor statements, and media interviews. 65 **[Even]{.underline}**
**[resolutions]{.underline}**, [far from serving a purely
symbolic]{.underline} [function]{.underline}, **[can frame the
narrative]{.underline}** and push the administration to care about
something.66

### 2NC \-\-- Solvency \-\-- (Constructive Pressure)

#### Comparatively, Congress can better mediate tensions and encourage burden-sharing.

Eric

Transatlantic tensions over burden-sharing: [Burden-sharing]{.underline}
[is the area of NATO policy]{.underline} [where]{.underline}
[Congress]{.underline} has [traditionally been most active]{.underline}.
[Congressional pressure]{.underline}, calibrated effectively, [can give
the executive]{.underline} [branch]{.underline} **[leverage with
allies.]{.underline}** [The legislative branch]{.underline}, as
[the]{.underline} [rep]{.underline}resentative [of the American
taxpayer]{.underline} [and]{.underline} the [overseer of the U.S.
defense budget]{.underline}, **[is well-equipped to play this
role.]{.underline}**

However, Congress should consider several caveats. First, the issue of
burden-sharing is especially sensitive after the Trump presidency. With
allies wary that future U.S. administrations will treat burden-sharing
the way Trump did,88 congressional pressure could easily become a source
of friction. Second, while Congress may find it politically valuable to
crack down on "free-riding" allies, ultimately the executive branch does
the negotiating.89 A heavy-handed congressional approach that isn't
coordinated with the executive could disrupt ongoing diplomatic efforts
on a variety of issues.

With these obstacles in mind, members of Congress can contribute to a
better burdensharing debate by keeping in mind Stanley Sloan's idea of
"constructive pressure."90 Members can signal their continued wish for
more equitable allied contributions without weaponizing the issue
(particularly in public). At the same time, they can make an important
concession to allied concerns by showing that they understand the
problems with the two percent metric and are open to rethinking it. In
this way, Congress could help tackle the burden-sharing challenge as
well as the "need for new metrics" challenge. 91 I recommend:

Ø Use carefully framed NDAA language to focus attention on
burden-sharing. Congress should insert language about burden-sharing
into the much-watched annual National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA),
one of the only pieces of foreign policy legislation that Congress
consistently passes. The NDAA is one of Congress' most important formal
tools for influencing foreign policy, and the executive branch and
foreign countries pay close attention to it.

[In the spirit of "**constructive pressure**"]{.underline} and given
lingering concerns about the Trump era, [it's important]{.underline}
[that any]{.underline} NDAA [language]{.underline} on burden-sharing
[avoid a punitive or demanding]{.underline} [tone]{.underline}. [One
approach might be to emphasize]{.underline} [the importance of equitable
burden-sharing]{.underline} [while avoiding specific
reference]{.underline} [to the two percent metric]{.underline}, which
carries some sensitivity because it has been wielded as a hammer in the
past. This approach would also have the advantage of opening the door to
new proposals for measuring contributions.

On this and other recommendations, [congressional
practitioners]{.underline} [should keep in mind]{.underline} that
**[their strengths are setting the agenda]{.underline}**, **[shaping the
narrative]{.underline}**, **[and convening political support for
priorities]{.underline}**, not legislating specific alliance policies.
Even fairly vague NDAA language can serve this purpose. Compared to more
detailed provisions, general language is also likely to be more feasible
for members to agree on and more helpful to the executive branch and to
NATO.

Ø **[Encourage allies to meet their commitments, but be
constructive]{.underline}**. Several [interviewees]{.underline}
[suggested]{.underline} that [members of Congress should
**directly**]{.underline} **[communicate to foreign
counterparts]{.underline}** that burden-sharing is important to them,
**[while avoiding being overly punitive]{.underline}** or calling
countries out publicly.

[Acknowledge other forms of contribution]{.underline}. [Individual
members can **use hearings, briefings, statements to the
media**]{.underline}, and Dear Colleague letters [to build a
two-pronged]{.underline} [narrative]{.underline}: [Allies need to meet
their defense spending commitments]{.underline}, [but contributions to
NATO consist]{.underline} of [more than just military spending
numbers]{.underline}.93 Again, [members should remember that as
narrative-shapers and agenda-setters]{.underline}, [**they can make a
meaningful contribution** **to the burden-sharing debate** by simply
engaging with it. They don't need to have a specific solution or policy
proposal in mind before they can get involved.]{.underline}

alliance choose**]{.underline} **[which recommendations to focus on and
develop a narrower, more feasible agenda for NATO policy

[Congressional engagement]{.underline} on the reflection process [could
take the form of a joint letter]{.underline} [to the secretary general
responding to the report]{.underline}, a request to the administration
for further information about some of the recommendations, [or **simply
a public statement**]{.underline} **[endorsing certain
recommendations]{.underline}** while expressing the need for more study

[Congress has **increasingly stepped**]{.underline} [in to fill the
President's void by supporting alliances]{.underline}. The US
Constitution grants foreign policy powers to both the executive and
legislative branches, with the system designed as an "[invitation to
struggle](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/us-foreign-policy-powers-congress-and-president)."

For example, Congress differs from the President over its support for
NATO. Pre-empting the President's visit to the July NATO summit in
Brussels, the Senate
overwhelmingly [passed](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-07-11/trump-strikes-combative-tone-as-leaders-arrive-nato-update) a
bipartisan resolution expressing support for NATO. The NATO Observer
Group
was [relaunched](https://www.defensenews.com/global/europe/2018/03/01/us-senators-revive-nato-observer-group/) in
early 2018 and saw its Senate

the [contentious](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/12/world/europe/trump-nato-russia.html) Brussels
summit; with its Republican
leaders [voicing](https://www.defensenews.com/congress/2018/07/19/congress-would-stop-trump-from-nato-exit-key-senators-say/) that
Congress had the means and will to prevent the President from
withdrawing the US from NATO.
In [August](http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/congress-to-nato-we-have-your-back),
twenty senators organised a private meeting with NATO officials and
European diplomats to reassure them of Congress' commitment to NATO and
downplay the President's behaviour. While the President has not
indicated that he will soften
his [criticism](https://www.politico.eu/article/trump-threatens-to-pull-out-of-nato/) of
NATO, [Congress' support for the alliance system]{.underline} [and
their]{.underline} [increasing willingness to get involved in

allies]{.underline}** [seeking to]{.underline} [prevent]{.underline}
[the President from **taking drastic action**]{.underline}, such as
withdrawing **[from security treaties]{.underline}**.

Australia has long recognised the value of cultivating relationships
with Congress, using [diplomatic
lobbying](https://www.internationalaffairs.org.au/australianoutlook/lobbying-key-to-australia-us-relations/) as
a tool to build connections, gain information and advocate for
Australia's interests. Establishing its ["own in-house lobbying

the Congressional Liaison Office, the embassy's congressional outreach
has delivered tangible results, including the passing of the
Australia-US Free Trade Agreement and E3 visa. The aftermath of
the [tense](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/no-gday-mate-on-call-with-australian-pm-trump-badgers-and-brags/2017/02/01/88a3bfb0-e8bf-11e6-80c2-30e57e57e05d_story.html?utm_term=.104cb56c6f64) Turnbull-Trump
phone call illustrated
the [benefits](https://www.ussc.edu.au/analysis/congress-rallies-around-australia) of
these efforts, as more than sixty members of Congress reached out to
Australia's ambassador to express their support for the alliance.
Resolutions reaffirming the alliance were passed by both houses and a
bipartisan "[Friends of
Australia](https://usa.embassy.gov.au/news/launch-friends-australia-congressional-caucuses)"
caucus was launched. This
congressional [pressure](https://assets.ussc.edu.au/view/62/78/eb/86/c8/c9/3e/dc/a6/a4/06/38/51/cc/8a/ac/original/959a3d253927020b0ed1a1bd671e65306f29b4f4/security-challenges-journal-dougal-robinson.pdf) contributed
to the President's shift towards
a [friendlier](https://www.sbs.com.au/news/no-greater-friends-trump-phones-to-congratulate-scott-morrison) approach
to Australia --- seen in
its [exemption](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/foreign-affairs/how-team-australia-won-exemption-from-us-trade-tariffs/news-story/4c9f16a42b03cb3f1b476977f7da2a8b) from
steel tariffs --- and suggests that in some cases, Congress can act as a
moderating force on Trump's alliance management.

Ultimately however, [the President has the]{.underline}
[most [significant](https://books.google.com.au/books/about/A_World_in_Disarray.html?id=VEkKDAAAQBAJ&redir_esc=y) power]{.underline}

has [tended](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2016-12-12/congress-and-war) to
**defer to the executive on foreign policy**]{.underline}. In some
cases,
their [obstruction](https://www.ussc.edu.au/analysis/is-us-congress-the-main-impediment-to-a-rules-based-order) of

"rules-based order."

Furthermore, [the]{.underline} [domestic]{.underline} political

Congress' [dysfunction](https://www.ussc.edu.au/analysis/australia-and-the-2018-us-midterm-elections-a-primer) and

What has gone wrong? Two sources of dysfunction are central to the
current impasse:

The [first is **a mismatch**]{.underline} [between]{.underline} the
[checks and]{.underline} [balances]{.underline} [built into the U.S.
system]{.underline} [and]{.underline} the [**extreme polarization** now
separating]{.underline} the two major political parties. [By
constitutional]{.underline} [design]{.underline}, [U.S. policymaking
moves slowly]{.underline}; [the president cannot dictate]{.underline}
[what happens in Congress]{.underline}, [and]{.underline}
[legislators]{.underline} [use separate procedures]{.underline} in the
House and Senate [that then must be]{.underline} [reconciled to write
law.]{.underline} In the past, [eventual compromise]{.underline} [was
the standard outcome]{.underline}, [at least when]{.underline} [some
legislators]{.underline} [worked across party lines.]{.underline} **[Not
anymore.]{.underline}**

The [Democratic]{.underline} [and Republican]{.underline}
[parties]{.underline} **[have been moving apart
ideologically]{.underline}** since the 1970s, but [in the past 10 years
this **has dramatically accelerated**]{.underline}. For the first time
in the more than three decades since National Journal began compiling
vote ratings for the U.S. Senate, the tallies for the last Congress
showed that there was not a single Democrat more conservative than the
most liberal Republican; the center, in other words, cannot hold ---
because it has disappeared. Instead, American parties now resemble
parliamentary parties: [Party leaders crack the whip**, and fewer
members are willing to flout orders and compromise**]{.underline}.
**[The result: gridlock.]{.underline}**

[The second major]{.underline} [dysfunction]{.underline} [has to do with
the asymmetry]{.underline} [of]{.underline} this
[polarization]{.underline}. The Republican Party has become the home of
ideologically extreme insurgents who shun conventionally understood
facts, evidence, and science, and scorn the very idea of working out
compromises with a legitimate political opposition. This radicalized GOP
is now willing to use all the levers in the constitutional system even
if it means delay and deadlock.

In a parliamentary system, [a fiercely oppositional minority party is to
be expected]{.underline}. In the American system, **[it cannot
work]{.underline}**. [With]{.underline} the [Republicans]{.underline}
[deciding to use the filibuster]{.underline} in the Senate as a routine
tool of obstruction (they have resorted to the filibuster with a
frequency in the last three years unprecedented in U.S. history),
[passing legislation]{.underline} [now in effect]{.underline}
[requires]{.underline} [not a majority but **60 votes out of
100.**]{.underline} What's more, [any legislation]{.underline} [that
manages to pass under those conditions]{.underline}, [taken without
broad bipartisan consensus]{.underline}, **[divides the
country]{.underline}** [and is seen by many as **illegitimate or
ill-advised**]{.underline}. That is the story of Barack Obama's first
two years in office. Democrats, who were in charge of both the House and
Senate, pushed through a wide range of measures from health-care reform
to economic stimulus to financial regulation, but the minority made a
concerted effort to delegitimize them.

What came after was even worse: The 2010 midterm elections produced a
divided-party government, genuine gridlock, and the least productive
Congress in memory. This year saw the enactment of only 83 laws, a
quarter of them naming post offices or making other symbolic acts. Of
course, quality is more important than quantity (whatever else the
famous \"do-nothing\" 80th Congress did, it passed the Marshall Plan).
In the case of this 112th Congress, however, the quality is as abysmal
as the quantity; the most significant public-policy action was the
debacle surrounding the debt ceiling, which resulted in the first
credit-rating downgrade in America's history. Now, following that
reckless hostage-taking of what should have been a standard legislative
act, a totally unnecessary \"fiscal cliff\" looms, threatening another
recession. The problems here are not redeemable with quick fixes because
the divisions are tribal and the problems are as much cultural as
structural.

[This lethal combination of forces]{.underline} **[has serious
implications]{.underline} not** [just for America's ability to solve its
problems**; it also poisons America's standing in the
world**]{.underline} --- [**its ability to project its values abroad,
garner the trust and respect of allies, and serve as a role model for
nascent democracies and a counterpoint to autocracies**.]{.underline}

[Research]{.underline} on this question, [supplemented]{.underline} [by
interviews]{.underline} with leading policymakers, [offer
details]{.underline} [that reveal ho]{.underline}w
[profoundly]{.underline} the [policymaking]{.underline} environment [has
been]{.underline} altered.(30)

First[, there are ever **fewer centrists** elected]{.underline}
[to]{.underline} [Congress]{.underline} [from either major
party]{.underline}, [and those that remain]{.underline}
[find]{.underline} **[few electoral incentives]{.underline}** [for
taking tough votes]{.underline} [on international policy.]{.underline}
Consequently, [there are fewer Members]{.underline} [prepared to place
**institutional prerogatives over partisan politics**]{.underline}. In
the late 1980s, there were a dozen liberal Republicans to 'the left' of
conservative Democrats, often from southern states, and vice versa. In
the last Congress, the most conservative senator in the Democratic
caucus, Joe Manchin of West Virginia, was still ranked as more liberal
than the most moderate Republican, Susan Collins of Maine.(31) Those who
challenge party orthodoxy, or who reach across the political aisle to
support a bipartisan compromise---or to defend the institutional
prerogatives of Congress---are at greater risk of being defeated. As a
consequence, [Members]{.underline} [of both parties have]{.underline}
[adopted]{.underline} [a classic '**blame avoidance'**]{.underline}
[strategy]{.underline} [to **dodge difficult votes**]{.underline} [while
reserving the ability to blame the President for foreign initiatives
gone awry]{.underline}.(32) In fact, several powerful Senate Foreign
Relations Committee chairmen have lost their re-election bids. The list
includes William Fulbright of Arkansas, Frank Church of Idaho and
Charles Percy of Illinois. Many incumbents now fear primary election
challenges more than general elections. Primary voters defeated relative
moderates such as Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Richard
Lugar (R-IN) in 2010, while Trump critic Bob Corker, a popular Tennessee
Republican retired unexpectedly in 2019. The muchnoted 'sorting out' of
parties has significantly increased party-line voting while
dis-incentivizing would-be champions of the institution of Congress.(33)
This has occurred most notably on domestic issues such as health
care---not a single Republican voted for Obamacare, even after Democrats
accepted scores of GOP-sponsored amendments. Stimulus spending and tax
cuts also became party-line votes in the House. Yet, [it]{.underline}
also [happened on issues like the Iran nuclear pact]{.underline},
[where]{.underline} [Republicans voted en bloc]{.underline} [against an
agreement]{.underline} [that had been supported by U.S]{.underline}. and
Israeli military and intelligence leaders, [five United Nations Security
Council partners, including]{.underline} [key European
allies]{.underline}, as well as Russia and China[. This party-line
voting]{.underline} on security matters [and the failure to defend
institutional prerogatives]{.underline} "[makes it easier for future
administrations]{.underline} **[to just ignore the will of
Congress]{.underline}**," Senator Chris Coons (D-DE) observes, "[it
means there'll be less and less bipartisanship in defending
Congress]{.underline}.(34)

In this hyper-polarized legislative environment, **[bipartisan
coalitions]{.underline}** [**to sustain** Washington's
international]{.underline} [**policy** **initiatives**]{.underline}
**[are very difficult to achieve]{.underline}**. [This **harms U.S.
national security interests**.]{.underline} Former GOP Chairwoman
Ros-Lehtinen graphically describes the difficulty of passing even a
routine State Department authorization in this environment: "The House
Foreign Affairs Committee mark-up on the State Department funding bill
suffered from dozens of amendments that were simply about social
engineering and political messaging. When you try to bring a bill like
that to the floor, with so many divisive social issues, you get a 'No'
from leadership."(35) [Similarly]{.underline}, [nonpartisan]{.underline}
[efforts to defend the]{.underline} [institution of
Congress]{.underline} **[have been weakened]{.underline}**. As one
former House leader and veteran appropriator, Vic Fazio of California,
recently testified, "The job of the minority is now to make sure that
the governing majority accomplishes little or nothing."(36)

[A second factor in]{.underline} [Capitol Hill's decline]{.underline}
[has been the **twenty-four-hour news cycle**]{.underline} and the rise
of social media. [Both have made nuanced positioning]{.underline} [on
breaking foreign]{.underline} [developments more difficult]{.underline}.
[Flip comments]{.underline} by inveterate Twitter users **[crowd out
more thoughtful analysis]{.underline}**. [Hard line
positions]{.underline} **[are rewarded by voters]{.underline}** [and
locked in early]{.underline} [by earned media coverage]{.underline}. The
President of the United States boasted by Tweet in 2019 about nominating
a poorly qualified, controversial Director of National Intelligence,
then counting on the press to 'vet' him after the presidential
announcement.(37) [Legislators]{.underline} also [spend far less time in
Washington working together]{.underline}. Bipartisan CODELS
("congressional delegations") making fact-finding missions overseas,
have been cut back. In the Senate, leaders have doubled the number of
committee assignments while reducing the number of substantive bills
given consideration. Consequently, recent research has shown, that there
is greater policy diversification and less specialization.(38)
Legislators are increasingly generalists, fewer are specialists in
foreign or defense policy. [The development of policymaking
expertise]{.underline}, **[especially in foreign policy]{.underline}**,
an area deemed of less interest to voters, [is punished rather than
rewarded]{.underline}. In addition, term limits on committee chairs---a
reform initiative from decades past---has further reduced the
development of expertise necessary to stand up to a unified executive
branch front led by the President.

A third factor is that the marquee foreign policymaking committees,
panels that once wielded the power to check presidents, have themselves
declined. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee is Exhibit A here. The
committee was once a panel led by vigorous challengers to presidential
authority. William Fulbright used it to build a national case against
the Vietnam War expanded by his political ally, fellow southern Democrat
Lyndon Johnson. Frank Church used the panel to build the case for
nuclear arms control and the Panama Canal treaties, while checking CIA
excesses. Republican Jesse Helms pressed from his leadership position on
the panel to curb U.S. support for international organizations.(39) Such
was the high esteem of the panel that Senator Jack Kennedy's father,
eager to prepare for the 1960 presidential contrast, implored
then-Senate Majority Leader LBJ to grant his son a seat on the panel in
the 1950s, blocking a more senior political rival, Estes Kefauver.

In the last Congress, the committee was led by a quiet isolationist from
Idaho, Jim Risch, who is not held in high regard by foreign policy
experts on both sides of the aisle. The Senate panel that once seated
Dick Lugar, John Kerry, Chuck Hagel and Barack Obama still attracts
White House aspirants. Ted Cruz of Texas, Rand Paul of Kentucky, and
Marco Rubio of Florida all joined the panel prior to their own
presidential campaigns. But this panel, and its House counterpart, are
now deemed by most legislators less desirable than in previous eras. The
House committee still attracts some legislators committed to a strong
institutional role for Congress. But [it also has Members
enamored]{.underline} [of foreign travel and well-supported by interest
groups with a stake in international matters.]{.underline} In the House,
where Members face voters every two years and are more tied to parochial
districts, getting Members to serve on the Foreign Affairs Committee has
been a challenge for party leaders.(40)

The reason why these two key [authorizing committees]{.underline} have
**[lost much of their luster]{.underline}** **[and influence is
clear]{.underline}**: **[they rarely pass any significant
legislation]{.underline}**. In fact, few major committees of Congress
act less on legislation. With no significant treaties coming before the
Senate in the last decade, the Foreign Relations panel garners less
public and press attention. With no authorization debates, it has
legislative power over fewer funds and programs. In the void left by
decades of failing to pass even an annual authorization bill for the
State Department, the committees and their public education functions,
even their champions and leaders concede, are less relevant.(41) Today
the work of the House and Senate foreign affairs committees, which
employ several dozen senior staff experts on bilateral relationships and
regional security challenges, is often "eviscerated by four
appropriations subcommittee clerks, who are not foreign policy experts,"
as one veteran legislator laments.(42) It should be noted, [this
phenomenon obtains on **most legislation**]{.underline}**,** not just on
national security matters.

promoting cooperation]{.underline}** **[among NATO
allies]{.underline}**, **[any]{.underline}** U.S. **[retrenchment from
Europe would help address existing problems]{.underline}**, but there
are strong reasons to be skeptical.

**[With Europe's limited funds to spend]{.underline}** on defense,
**[large cooperative projects will be difficult to

abandoned]{.underline}** cooperative **[projects because of their
negative]{.underline}** domestic **[implications for

change anytime soon.

may **[even have a strategic interest in leaving

### Pressure CP\-\--Fails

#### Threatening to [cut-off]{.underline} aid pushes countries [closer]{.underline} to Russia and [fails]{.underline} to create [concessions]{.underline} for the US.

"President Trump wants to pressure allies by cutting foreign aid. That
never works." Washington Post. 8-25-2017.
https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/posteverything/wp/2017/08/25/president-trump-wants-to-pressure-allies-by-cutting-foreign-aid-that-never-works/
//EM

In his speech this week on his plans for the U.S. military presence in
Afghanistan, President **[Trump said he will use the threat of
withdrawing]{.underline}** foreign aid **[to]{.underline}** **[put
pressure on Pakistan to better support the American
mission]{.underline}**. **[Despite]{.underline}** proposing **[dramatic
cuts to the State Department and]{.underline}** U.S. Agency for
International Development budgets, the Trump administration still
requested \$740 million in foreign aid for Pakistan, so this threat
carries significant weight. Then, **[just one day later]{.underline}**,
**[news broke that the]{.underline}** State **[Department is withholding
\$195 million in]{.underline}** military **[aid for Egypt]{.underline}**
and has revoked another \$95 million in foreign aid, **[seeming proof
that we are willing to use aid as leverage]{.underline}**.

But history shows that foreign aid is a poor way to get what we want.
**[Threatening to cut off aid is almost certain to fail in
bringing]{.underline}** about **[political change in]{.underline}**
Egypt, Pakistan or **[any country that the]{.underline}**
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[has a strategic
interest in supporting]{.underline}**.

**[U.S. foreign aid has]{.underline}** long **[been held out as a carrot
to reward countries that embrace democracy]{.underline}** and free
markets. For example, the Millennium Challenge Corporation, a foreign
aid agency created under George W. Bush, awards funds only to countries
that are undertaking liberal political and economic reforms. During the
Cold War, increased aid was also offered as a potential reward to
failing states such as El Salvador. During a visit there by then-Vice
President George H.W. Bush at the height of the country's civil war,
**[El Salvador was promised a massive increase in]{.underline}**
military **[assistance in exchange for]{.underline}** **[the removal of
military leaders suspected of]{.underline}** **[h]{.underline}**uman
**[r]{.underline}**ights **[abuses and]{.underline}** **[greater
restraint by the government-aligned]{.underline}** "death squad
**[terrorists]{.underline}**" **[who had killed
thousands]{.underline}**. While death squad killings did decline, the
lull in violence was short lived. According to Human Rights Watch, there
were 1,900 political killings and disappearances in El Salvador only a
year after Bush's visit. Promises of aid didn't stop the violence, but
Congress still approved the Reagan administration's \$61.7 million aid
request to resupply the Salvadoran military, which was apparently
running out of bullets.

**[The cutoff of aid has]{.underline}** also **[been used as a
stick]{.underline}** --- **[either threatened or enforced]{.underline}**
--- **[to motivate countries to get back on track with]{.underline}**
U.S. **[objectives]{.underline}**. In 2010, **[U.S. military aid to
several]{.underline}** Pakistani **[military units was cut as punishment
for]{.underline}** **[h]{.underline}**uman **[r]{.underline}**ights
**[abuses]{.underline}**, **[including at least 300]{.underline}**
**[extrajudicial executions in the Swat Valley]{.underline}**. In a war
for "hearts and minds," killing civilians doesn't help. But the Obama
administration undermined the impact of the cuts by simultaneously
negotiating a \$2 billion counterterrorism package with Pakistan. The
following year, the Obama administration suspended 40 percent of the \$2
billion package in an attempt to secure greater cooperation from the
Pakistani military in fighting against the Taliban --- the very same
thing Trump threatened.

Why does aid fail to change governments' behavior? **[One of the reasons
is that we give most of our foreign aid to countries that
are]{.underline}** strategically **[important]{.underline}** to the
United States --- nations like Egypt and Pakistan. **[We need their
continued cooperation]{.underline}** on a range of issues, **[and
this]{.underline}** ultimately **[limits the amount of pressure we can
apply.]{.underline}** Sometimes **[there are developments beyond our
control]{.underline}**. **[Restrictions on foreign aid to Indonesia were
eased]{.underline}** in 2005 **[after a tsunami devastated parts of the
country]{.underline}**. Other times, the cuts in aid are too small to
matter. In 2015, \$5 million in aid was withheld from Mexico after the
summary execution of 22 suspected gang members during the country's
ongoing drug war. But that amounted to 15 percent of U.S. support for
the Mexican police and military under the Merida Initiative. The Mexican
military continues to support local police forces, recently killing 17
in a firefight, which suggests that little has changed in the Mexican
government's strategy.

Often, **[cutting aid is]{.underline}** simply **[not enough to force
change]{.underline}**. In Mali, the **[Obama administration
suspended]{.underline}** \$70 million in **[bilateral aid]{.underline}**
--- roughly half of U.S. aid to the country --- **[after a 2012
coup]{.underline}**. **[The State Department said aid would resume at
normal levels]{.underline}** **[once]{.underline}** democratic **[rule
was restored]{.underline}**. The coup leader stepped down, but the
military remained in power. Presidential elections were held more than a
year later, after French military intervention in the country.

**[Pressuring countries through foreign aid can]{.underline}** also
**[drive them away from the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates. **[This fear was strongest during the Cold
War]{.underline}**, **[when the Soviet Union was]{.underline}** actively
**[competing for influence]{.underline}** in developing countries,
**[but it's still very real]{.underline}**. In the Philippines,
President Rodrigo Duterte's war on drugs has led to thousands of deaths.
In response, the U.S. postponed millions of dollars in foreign aid.
Duterte also rejected \$280 million in aid from the European Union
because it was pressuring him to improve human rights conditions. Aid
can no longer buy political influence in the Philippines.

#### Non-escalatory is critical to get allies to agree

**O'Hanlon '19** \[Michael; October 2019; Senior Fellow and Director of
Research in Foreign Policy at the Brookings Institution, adjunct
Professor at Columbia and Georgetown University, Ph.D. in Public and
International Affairs from Princeton University; Foreign Affairs, "Can
America Still Protect Its Allies?"
<https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/world/2019-08-12/can-america-still-protect-its-allies>\]

A sanctions-based strategy would be judicious and proportionate, but it
would not be weak. Indeed, if Beijing or Moscow refused to either back
down or otherwise resolve the dispute once the United States and its
allies had deployed sanctions, Washington could raise the stakes.
Recognizing that the aggressor state's strategic aims had become
fundamentally untrustworthy or hostile, Washington could seek to not
only punish the perpetrator for its specific action but also limit its
future economic growth. Over time, export controls and permanent
sanctions could replace temporary punitive measures. [[This]{.mark}
strategy would [**require support** from]{.mark} key **U.S.
[allies]{.mark}** to be effective]{.underline}---one more reason why
[[Washington needs to]{.mark} respond to]{.underline} these kinds of
[crises in a way that [seem]{.mark}s [**judicious**, **patient**, and
**non-escalatory**]{.mark}, so as [to **strengthen its coalition** and
not **scare**]{.mark} **away**]{.underline} key
[[partners]{.underline}]{.mark}.

### Pressure CP\-\--Fails\-\--Spending

#### European countries will not [increase]{.underline} defense commitments [unliterally]{.underline}.

Center for International Security and Cooperation.. "Analysis."

//EM

President **[Trump's reassurances]{.underline}** last week to U.K. Prime
Minister Theresa May **[that the]{.underline}** North American Treaty
Organization (**[NATO) was]{.underline}** not, in fact,
**["obsolete"]{.underline}** **[are unlikely to have Europe taking up
more]{.underline}** of the **[defense burden]{.underline}**, at least
**[in the short term]{.underline}**.

As discussed here in the Monkey Cage, national security adviser Michael
T. Flynn wants to see other NATO members pay more of the cost of
defending Europe. **[It's not a new pitch]{.underline}**, **[but such
calls neglect the budgetary]{.underline}**, **[financial and political
barriers to enhanced]{.underline}** military **[capabilities in
Europe]{.underline}**.

And such barriers will remain in place even if European countries
succeed in implementing ambitious defense plans that include active
measures to strengthen defense cooperation, endow the E.U. with defense
capabilities and launch a common research fund.

Trump's national security adviser wants to water down U.S. NATO
commitments

The transatlantic gap in military capabilities --- how much defense
output the two sides of the Atlantic are able to generate, respectively
--- has three main causes that cannot easily be addressed:

1\) European **[countries have limited]{.underline}** defense
**[budgets]{.underline}** --- On average, **[defense expenditure in
Europe is just over 1 percent of GDP]{.underline}**, **[while the U.S.
defense]{.underline}** budget **[is well above 4 percent]{.underline}**
of GDP. **[Would a U.S. retrenchment push]{.underline}** **[European
allies]{.underline}** to **[fix this imbalance]{.underline}**, **[and
bring NATO members]{.underline}** **[closer to the 2
percent]{.underline}** **[threshold]{.underline}** they pledged to move
toward in 2014?

Maybe. But **[half of NATO's members are small]{.underline}** countries
**[with small defense budgets]{.underline}**, well below \$2 billion per
year. Thus, a **[substantial bump in their]{.underline}** military
**[spending won't bring about a]{.underline}** significant **[increase
in Europe's]{.underline}** overall **[military
investments.]{.underline}** Estonia's 2 percent GDP defense expenditure
amounts to just \$500 million, for instance. That might pay for the
operational costs of a few of middle-sized U.S. warships, but
**[wouldn't push back a Russian invasion]{.underline}**.

### Pressure CP\-\--Turn

#### Threatening allies creates [extended]{.underline} fears AND [collapses]{.underline} deterrence.

#### Unilateral and NATO norms fail -- only bilateral relations solve norms and [deterrence]{.underline} 

**Goldman 20** \[Emily, Director of the US Cyber Command; "From Reaction
to Action: Adopting a Competitive Posture in Cyber Diplomacy"; Fall 2020
; DOA: 7/20/22; <http://dx.doi.org/10.26153/tsw/10950>; Lowell-ES\]

America's approach to building cyber norms should adapt to the following
realities. First, the United States is not in a hegemonic position to
define the agenda for norms in cyberspace**[. For a single actor to set
the public agenda and drive a convergence of behavior, it would need to
have control over the primary incentives and disincentives within the
system, which the United States does not possess]{.underline}**. Nor is
there a clear manner in which the United States could obtain such
primary control, due to the highly diffuse nature of cyberspace. Second,
what is and what is not currently acceptable varies greatly depending on
national perspectives, even among liberal democratic states. Despite the
stated **[desire of the United States to establish norms]{.underline}**
through international cooperation, such norms have not emerged. The
result is intense competition to drive a convergence of expectations on
behavior in cyberspace.

An alternative yet related approach to building norms is to model good
behavior. Convergence of norms will occur over time as other actors see
that more beneficial outcomes flow from modelled good behavior than from
bad behavior. This approach presents several challenges. First, behavior
that might be categorized as unacceptable still produces benefits that
outweigh costs. Second, adversaries cite various allegations of American
bad behavior in cyberspace --- global surveillance and the Stuxnet hack
of the Iranian nuclear program are two examples --- in labeling the
United States a hypocritical standard-bearer for norms. Third, as both
state and nonstate actors continue to advance their interests through
behaviors that the United States considers unacceptable, modelling can
easily be misunderstood as tacit acceptance.41

A third approach is reaction to a massively disruptive or destructive
event that galvanizes global attention. This is how norms against
genocide were set after the Holocaust. This approach presents obvious
challenges. Relying on disaster to set norms is not an acceptable
strategy**[. Nor does it seem likely that cyber capabilities will
generate the level of abhorrence that characterize attitudes toward
nerve agents, for example, and which have led to self-imposed
proscriptions on their use]{.underline}**.42

A fourth approach is for convergence of expectations to organically
evolve through interaction. Common law demonstrates how norms emerge
through practice and mature through political and legal discourse. The
process of norm convergence for cyberspace has been troubling, however.
For the last 10 years, the United States has witnessed the emergence of
de facto norms antithetical to U.S. interests, defined by massive theft
of intellectual property, expanding control of internet content, attacks
on data confidentiality and availability, violations of privacy, and
interference in democratic debates and processes. These activities have
become normalized because the United States did not push back on them
persistently and early on.43 This has encouraged more experimentation
and envelope-pushing short of armed conflict. Conversely, if the United
States began countering such practices, it could help to counteract this
trend and encourage a form of normalization more suited to meeting U.S.
interests.

These pathways can be mutually reinforcing. The first two approaches
have largely succeeded with U.S. allies and partners, but important
differences with major competitors remain. **[Existing conditions do not
allow the United States to dictate norm adoption]{.underline}**: The
opening decades of the 21st century are not the late 1940s, and **[no
state is sufficiently powerful to dictate the rules of the
road.]{.underline}** Moreover, the third approach may be inoperable.
Waiting for a disaster is politically and morally problematic. The
fourth approach of "normalization" holds more promise for engaging with
competitors and steering Moscow and Beijing toward preferred norms.
Norms are constructed through "normal" practice and then become codified
in international agreements. By persistently engaging and contesting
cyberspace aggression, the United States can draw parameters around what
is acceptable, nuisance, unacceptable, and intolerable. The United
States should not abandon U.N. First Committee processes on responsible
state behavior in cyberspace, or other avenues for socialization such as
international institutions or cyber capacity-building programs. But
**[to be more effective, explicit bargaining can be reinforced by tacit
bargaining]{.underline}** **[through maneuver]{.underline}** with
non-likeminded states in the strategic space below armed conflict.44
Diplomats have an important role to play in this process, **[by engaging
directly with opponents and communicating and explaining U.S.
preferences to allies and partners]{.underline}**.45 **[Diplomats can
also assist by mobilizing coalitions]{.underline}** --- of governments,
industries, academia, and citizenry, at home and abroad --- **[for
competition with ideological foes.]{.underline}**

[[Allies]{.mark} such as the U]{.underline}nited [K]{.underline}ingdom
[and Australia [support]{.mark}]{.underline} and encourage
[interoperability discussions and new investments]{.underline} during
senior-level interactions with the Army. For example, interoperability
discussions have historically dominated the agenda for the U.S.-British
army-to-army staff talks. [The Multinational Fusion Cell in the HQDA
brings together]{.underline} assigned [personnel from multiple allied
countries]{.underline} (the United Kingdom, Australia, Japan, Germany,
France, and others) **[to [focus on interoperability and]{.mark} to
develop [U.S.-allied bilateral interoperability
roadmaps]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Standing organizations, such as ABCANZ,
also exist to work through interoperability issues at the operational
level. [Large-scale exercises]{.underline}, such as the aforementioned
biannual Talisman Sabre series between the United States and Australia,
[are]{.underline} very much [focused on addressing interoperability
challenges identified from recent operations and planning for future
operations.]{.underline} NATO defines interoperability along three
dimensions---human, procedural, and technical---which is a helpful way
to categorize interoperability challenges.34 We find general agreement
among our interlocutors that [[SC with highly capable allies]{.mark} to
support human, procedural, and technical interoperability [is
advancing]{.mark}]{.underline} at the operational and tactical levels,
[[but there is concern]{.mark} about a lack of]{.underline} multiyear
[funding and programming to guide longer-term planning]{.underline} for
multinational interoperability exercises.35

Despite this focus, [interoperability initiatives]{.underline} at the
strategic level [have been]{.underline} relatively [ad hoc from allies'
perspectives]{.underline}. The Army's Interoperability Campaign Plan
frames and institutionalizes interoperability efforts internally and
operationalizes it with designated partners. [Allies support the Army's
focus on interoperability writ large, but the [links between
interoperability planning and]{.mark} ongoing [SC]{.mark} activities
[needs to be stronger]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} As an example, the
GORT, a bilateral event between the United States and the United Kingdom
at the three- and four-star level, is not explicitly linked to the
discussions that occur at the one- and two-star levels. According to key
allied officials, issues raised at the GORT level should be
automatically addressed at the subsequent Army staff talks (ASTs) and
drive the discussions at the lower level working groups.
[Interoperability [issues]{.mark}]{.underline} and priorities [raised at
the GORTs]{.underline}/staff [talks [should]{.mark}]{.underline} also
**[[be linked to]{.mark} other key [bilateral SC activities, creating a
real battle rhythm]{.mark} for interoperability.]{.underline}**

Moreover, [allies have suggested that]{.underline} [although
**[bilateral vision statements for
interoperability]{.mark}**]{.underline}---such as the emerging one with
the United Kingdom---[[**are positive steps**, their language could be
made stronger]{.underline}]{.mark} and clearer. [[They
suggest]{.underline}]{.mark} dropping the term vision and **[making
[bilateral campaign plans]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In addition,
aspirational verbs in Army plans, such as institutionalize, should be
replaced by stronger verbs, such as guarantee.36

[Both British and Australian officials talk about wanting to be the
United States' partner of choice]{.underline}; the United Kingdom has in
place an explicit strategic communications campaign plan that focuses on
improved access and science and technology collaboration. For the United
Kingdom[, [this]{.mark} partnering [includes]{.mark}]{.underline} such
areas as energy; [**[a]{.mark}nti[s]{.mark}ubmarine [w]{.mark}arfare**;
[hypersonics; **network command, control, and communications**]{.mark};
and [nuclear collaboration]{.mark}.]{.underline} For Australia, areas
include [[intell]{.mark}igence, [surveillance]{.mark}, and
[reconnaissance; radars;]{.mark} and other high-technology
systems]{.underline}. The emphasis on being a [partner of choice refers
to being capable, likeminded, and committed. It is understandable
why]{.underline} key [allies desire to have the strongest language
possible]{.underline} in interoperability planning documents.

### Solvency \-\-- Interoperability

#### Bilateral cooperation solves interoperability best

Challenge in Coalition Air Operations," 2000, pg online

The implications are twofold. The first is that **[interoperability
planning must be adaptive enough to accommodate the possibility of
coalitions of different sizes and composed of different coalition
partners]{.underline}**. **["Plug-and-play" is a concept that is well
known at the technological level. But it is also required at the
national level to provide for the possibility of different combinations
of coalition partners; to manage the comings and goings of coalition
members as the mission focus changes and/or missions are added,
completed, or abandoned; and to minimize disruptions to the overall
coalition effort. This suggests]{.underline}** a focus on long-term
interoperability solutions, including organizations, doctrine,
procedures, and system architectures that can accommodate the dynamic
character of coalitions, including transitions. \[Table A.3 OMITTED\]
The second implication is **[that because the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates' **[NATO allies vary in their coalition
participation]{.underline}** with the United States, **[the
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[might be able to

Communicate and Build Consensus

The **[State Department]{.underline}**'s foreign service
**[officers]{.underline}** **[forward-deployed]{.underline}**
**[as]{.underline}** "**[cyber diplomats]{.underline}**" can
**[strengthen consensus]{.underline}** **[among allies]{.underline}**

problem]{.underline}** and on the need for action to address it. To do
so, **[they should be conversant]{.underline}** **[with]{.underline}**
the **[U.S. gov]{.underline}**ernment's **[efforts to address cyber
competition and armed]{.underline}** **[with info]{.underline}**rmation
**[to speak authoritatively]{.underline}** about them. The **[State
Department]{.underline}** has long **[promote]{.underline}**d a
**[framework for responsible state behavior]{.underline}** in
cyberspace. The key **[elements of]{.underline}** that **[framework
include]{.underline}**: (1) affirmation that established principles of
international law apply to state behavior in cyberspace;62 (2)
**[adherence to certain]{.underline}** non-binding
**[norms]{.underline}** of state behavior in cyberspace during
peacetime; **[and]{.underline}** (3) **[consideration]{.underline}**,
**[development]{.underline}**, **[and implementation of practical
c]{.underline}**onfidence-**[b]{.underline}**uilding
**[m]{.underline}**easures **[to reduce]{.underline}** the **[risk of
conflict in cyberspace]{.underline}**. Since **[not all states share
American views]{.underline}** on responsible behavior in cyberspace, the
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[is working
with]{.underline}** partners and **[allies on collective
attribution]{.underline}** and imposition of consequences.

These **[initiatives]{.underline}** are now being **[complemented
by]{.underline}** the **[D]{.underline}**epartment **[o]{.underline}**f
**[D]{.underline}**efense's **[strategy of defend forward]{.underline}**
**[and]{.underline}** U.S. **[Cyber Command's operational approach
of]{.underline}** **[persistent engagement.]{.underline}** The State
Department and United States Agency for International Development
(USAID) officers in missions around the world need to be well-versed in
these other efforts and prepared to explain them to foreign partners on
a routine basis. **[America's partners]{.underline}** **[want to
understand U.S. government strategy]{.underline}** and policies.**[63 It
is U.S. policy that cross-domain responses to]{.underline}** **[cyber
aggression should be]{.underline}** **[complemented]{.underline}** with
**[steady and sustained activities]{.underline}** **[to]{.underline}**
make networks more resilient, to **[defend them as far forward as
practicable]{.underline}**, **[and]{.underline}** to
**[contest]{.underline}** the most **[dangerous
adversaries]{.underline}**.64 **[Every diplomatic
engagement]{.underline}** that includes cyber issues would be an
opportunity to **[build support for these mutually reinforcing
approaches.]{.underline}**

Bolster Cyber Cadre

The greatest talent, most consequential research and development, and
most innovative applications of cyber and other emerging technologies
are globally distributed across individuals, commercial entities,
governments, and academia. Competing successfully requires recognizing,
understanding, and leveraging insights and advances wherever they reside
in real time. The nation that best understands and can most rapidly
harvest the benefits of changing knowledge (e.g., quantum encryption,
artificial intelligence, machine learning, high performance computing,
big data, 5G) will be best positioned to secure its future. Conversely,
states that lag behind competitors will find closing gaps a daunting and
risky challenge. 5G represents the proverbial canary in the coal mine
because the United States lags behind China in deployment. Unless the
United States ensures the talent is in place to monitor and lead on
future technologies, it may again be caught unprepared.

The State Department does designate foreign service officers with a
cyber portfolio, but they are usually assigned as an additional duty,
often to economic officers at embassies and consulates. One option would
be a dedicated cadre of "cyber diplomacy-coned" officers,65 or even a
regional dedicated officer cadre located at a large or strategic embassy
in each region to augment the part-time officers at post. These cyber
diplomacy-coned foreign service officers would report on priorities and
trends in research and investments across governments, industries,
academia, and research institutes worldwide, and identify where
adversary regimes are vulnerable to diplomatic, information, military,
and economic threats.66 They would "identify and catalyze
opportunities," in the words of the U.S. National Security
Strategy,67helping to set the conditions for competition by building
mechanisms for information sharing and agile collaboration.

Enable Defend Forward

The U.S. National Cyber Strategy's guidance to promote a framework of
responsible state behavior in cyberspace, one that ensures there are
consequences for irresponsible behavior, is a key objective for the
United States. To succeed, this framework should be pursued in tandem
with an active approach to stem ongoing adversary cyberspace campaigns
outside of armed conflict. The Department of Defense is now defending
forward, outside its existing networks, to mitigate threats before they
reach the United States. It is time for the State Department to join in
these efforts.

An informal division of labor currently exists between the departments
of State and Defense, whereby the former promotes norms in traditional
diplomatic channels while the latter pursues defend forward through
military channels. Yet this leaves several problems unresolved. Parallel
communication increases the risk of messaging fratricide across military
and diplomatic channels in partner nations. Military cyber operations
may engage foreign policy sensitivities that the State Department is
better equipped to address. On the other hand, State Department desk
officers may throw a wrench into planning because they do not understand
Defense Department strategy.

can help **[institutionalize]{.underline}** these **[operational

#### And, that causes the U.S. to get frustrated and leave the project before the benefits happen \-\-- the cp solves best

**Lawrence et al '11**

(Anthony Lawrence, and Tomas Jermalavičius, International Center for
Defense and Security, "From the Cold War and Hot Peace to the Long War
and Beyond: What Are Our Armed Forces (Good) For?,"
https://abcd.icds.ee/2011-3/summary-2/)

"Smart defence" or more "pooling and sharing" and better burden sharing
could provide a way to increase collective capabilities even while
spending is declining. This is not an entirely new way of thinking if
defined it as the sum of all cooperative efforts and initiatives within
the EU and NATO, rather than just as common ownership of assets and
capabilities. **[Initiatives such as]{.underline}** cooperative
capability, **[security cooperation]{.underline}**, mutual development
or multinational formations such as Eurocorps -- all designed to
increase the capacity of the military to work together -- have existed
for a long time. New initiatives **[such as NATO's strategic airlift
consortium]{.underline}** further advance this thinking and practice. We
are already witnessing the dividends of these approaches in operations
in Afghanistan. Certainly, there are many areas where this must be taken
further and produce more -- all very well illustrated by capability gaps
in operations in Libya: air-to-air refuelling, ISTAR, combat SAR,
tactical airlift etc. It does not matter through what sort of
arrangement or under which nation's lead this is delivered, as long as
it is actually delivered rather than producing the very modest results
of many past initiatives (DCI, PCC etc.) or projects (e.g. helicopter
initiative in NATO). Civilian capabilities will also have to be
**[enhanced through cooperative efforts]{.underline}** such as the
Weimar initiative, since the management of many contemporary crises
requires civilian inputs. Prompted by the crisis, we often talk about
**[spending on new capabilities such as cyber,]{.underline}** but this
cannot become a substitute for investing in real capabilities (cyber
would have been of little use in Libya or against the Taliban) **[and
doing it in a collective, coordinated manner]{.underline}**. New
approaches are needed to obtain those capabilities, especially doing
away with many duplicate programmes in Europe. In the United States,
despite the inherent waste of a large defence organisation, the military
manage to derive a greater value from their investments than the
Europeans. **[If Europeans continue]{.underline}** in their current
approach of just **[shrinking]{.underline}** **[their]{.underline}**
"total war" **[force instead of reconfiguring it properly]{.underline}**
for the age of "limited wars", the **[Americans will simply turn away
and leave]{.underline}**. Their **[executive]{.underline}** branch
**[and the military realise]{.underline}** very well that **[even the
United States]{.underline}** cannot achieve everything alone and **[must
cooperate with its allies and partners in Europe, but]{.underline}**
**[this may not arrest the growing sentiment of giving up on Europe felt
in the legislative branch]{.underline}**. On the other hand, some of the
fault for the capability gaps and the steep decline in conventional
heavy capabilities in Europe rests with the United States: many
Europeans wanted to shine in the "coalitions of the willing" led by the
Americans and therefore developed capabilities which bought influence
instead of producing military effectiveness. "**[Pooling and sharing"
will work best if it comes in a "bottom up", pragmatic
fashion]{.underline}** -- much **[in the way of]{.underline}** the
recent UK-France **[d]{.underline}**efence **[c]{.underline}**ooperation
**[a]{.underline}**greement**[s]{.underline}** -- and if they are
**[linked with U.S. capabilities]{.underline}**. Indeed, it is likely
that **[most of the workable arrangements will be
bilateral]{.underline}** **[and multi-bilateral]{.underline}** **[rather
than genuinely multilateral.]{.underline}** "**[Pooling and sharing" has
its limits]{.underline}**, some of which arise **[from the difficulties
encountered in agreeing upon and then implementing decisions in a
consensus-based]{.underline}** decision-making culture in organisations
such as **[NATO]{.underline}** and the EU. More fundamentally, however,
diverging strategic cultures in Europe mean that **[there is no common
threat perception and no common understanding of why]{.underline}** and
in what circumstances the use of military force is necessary and
appropriate, **[which may render "pooled and shared" assets and
capabilities unusable]{.underline}**. There are interventionist
countries keen on using force to advance interests and values, and those
who exercise extreme caution and would reserve the use of force for the
defence of the Alliance's territory. (This was illustrated by the
challenges of reaching a common position with regard to NATO's
intervention in Libya.)

**[European and American defense analysts]{.underline}** have
traditionally **[agreed about the desirability of increased
coop]{.underline}**eration **[in defense tech]{.underline}**nology. The
current disarray in the Warsaw Pact leads to a sharply reduced threat
perception, while concurrently Western governments are under pressure to
provide increased economic assistance to Eastern Europe. Both factors
will tend to accelerate the decrease in Western defense spending. Yet,
at the same time, the **[increasing sophistication of weapons
systems]{.underline}** demands ever higher investments in research and
development. The **[resultant high per unit cost of weapons
systems]{.underline}** and consequently **[decreased ability of NATO
governments to purchase sufficient numbers]{.underline}** to meet
projected forces requirements, risks so-called ''structural disarmament.
**[Collaboration provides one answer to this dilemma in theory by
reducing duplicative R&D and achieving economies of scale through longer
production runs]{.underline}**. It **[also provides for a more robust
and cost-effective Alliance defense through standardization and improved
interoperability]{.underline}**. **[This]{.underline}**, of course,
**[presents the argument in]{.underline}** a somewhat **[idealized
form]{.underline}**. **[NATO collaborative projects]{.underline}** have
generally **[required lengthy negotiations and complex management
systems]{.underline}**, **[which increase costs]{.underline}** **[in
relation to the number of participating countries]{.underline}**. While
there is no established, accurate method of matching collaborative costs
against savings resulting from elimination of duplication of weapons

**[America's aversion to cost and risk also impacted NATO's internal

proclivity for working]{.underline}** **[behind the

**[meant]{.underline}** **[determining the alliance's agenda

Big 3 **[--- France, Britain, and West Germany]{.underline}** ---
**[rather than allowing NATO, with its "one state, one vote" procedures,
to determine U.S. policy]{.underline}**. At the same time, U.S. leaders
began objecting to allied "free-riding" starting in the 1960s. These
protestations were present even in the 1950s, when no less a figure than
President Eisenhower complained of "having the whole defense burden
placed on U.S. shoulders" and charged the Western Europeans with nearly
"making a sucker out of Uncle Sam."4 Assertions of this kind were
increasingly frequent during the second half of the Cold War. By that
time, not only had Western Europe effectively recovered from the
deprivations of World War II; the United States also faced mounting
economic problems and political dislocations at home. Combined, these
developments spurred a growing domestic debate over the necessity and
wisdom of American patronage of states that seemed able to assume
greater responsibility for their own defense. The net result was a
sustained American drive throughout the 1970s and 1980s to push Western
European states to assume greater burdens. U.S. officials threatened
that the United States might abandon NATO if the allies did not spend
more on their defense. Starting in 1981, Congress required the Defense
Department to issue an annual report on allied contributions to the
"common defense" so as to monitor, and potentially penalize, free-riders
and those falling short of their obligations. In 1984**[, a group of
senators led by]{.underline}** **[Sam Nunn]{.underline}**, the Georgia
Democrat, **[proposed withdrawing substantial U.S. forces from NATO on
an annual basis if European members of the alliance did not increase
their military budgets]{.underline}**. A bipartisan congressional panel
in 1988 bluntly concluded that "our allies are not sufficiently aware of
the **[strong political pressure]{.underline}** in this country **[to
reduce our defense commitments to our allies]{.underline}** unless they
are willing to shoulder more of the burden. This view **[is shared by
the Congress]{.underline}**. Therefore, the panel states in the
strongest possible terms that Europeans had better be prepared to defend
their own territory without a large-scale U.S. ground commitment,
because that commitment cannot be guaranteed forever."5

[[Bilateral]{.mark} defense cooperation agreements, or [DCAs,
are]{.mark}]{.underline} now [[the **most common form** of]{.mark}
institutionalized [defense cooperation]{.mark}. These]{.underline}
formal [[agreements establish]{.mark} broad defense-oriented [legal
frameworks]{.mark} between signatories, [facilitating
cooperation]{.mark} in]{.underline} such [fundamental areas]{.underline}
as defense policy coordination, research and development, joint military
exercises, education and training, arms procurement, and exchange of
classified information. Although [nearly a thousand DCAs are currently
in force, with]{.underline} potentially [wide-ranging impacts
on]{.underline} national and international [security
outcomes]{.underline}, DCAs have been largely ignored by scholars. Why
have DCAs proliferated? I develop a theory that integrates cooperation
theory with insights from social network analysis. [[Shifts in the
global]{.mark} security [environment]{.mark} since the 1980s have
[fueled demand for DCAs. **States use DCAs to modernize their
militaries, respond to**]{.mark} **shared security [threats, and
establish security umbrellas]{.mark}** with like-minded
states]{.underline}. Yet, demand alone cannot explain DCA proliferation;
to cooperate, [governments must]{.underline} also overcome dilemmas of
[mistrust and distributional conflicts]{.underline}. I show that
[network influences increase]{.underline} the supply of [DCAs by
providing governments with information about the trustworthiness of
partners and the risk of asymmetric distributions of gains]{.underline}.
[[DCAs]{.mark} [become easier]{.mark} to sign [as more states
sign]{.mark} them]{.underline}. I identify two specific network
influences---preferential attachment and triadic closure---and show that
these influences are largely responsible for the post-Cold War diffusion
of DCAs. Novel empirical strategies further indicate that these
influences derive from the proposed informational mechanism. [States use
the [DCA ties]{.mark} of others to glean information about prospective
defense partners, thus]{.underline} endogenously [[fuel]{.mark}ing
further [growth of the]{.mark} [global]{.mark} DCA
[network]{.mark}.]{.underline}

On 26 June 2015, the [US-Brazil defense cooperation]{.underline}
agreement entered into force. This agreement, the first formal defense
treaty between Brazil and the US in over thirty years, is ambitious in
scope, [[promoting cooperation in]{.underline}]{.mark} "defense-related
matters, especially in the fields of [r]{.underline}esearch [and
d]{.underline}evelopment, [logistics support, [tech]{.mark}nology
[security]{.mark}, and acquisition of]{.underline} defense products and
[services]{.underline}," [[as well as "exchanges of
info]{.mark}rmation," "combined military training and education," "joint
military exercises," "meetings between equivalent defense institutions,"
and "exchanges of]{.underline} instructors and training
[personnel]{.underline}."Footnote 1 Since the end of the Cold War,
**[[the US has signed similar bilateral d]{.mark}efense
[c]{.mark}ooperation [a]{.mark}greement[s]{.mark}]{.underline}**, or
DCAs, **[[with dozens of partners]{.underline}]{.mark}**. And the US is
not the only country active in DCAs. In 2015 alone, nearly a hundred
[DCAs were signed between countries as diverse as Indonesia and Turkey,
South Africa and Liberia, and Argentina and Russia.]{.underline}

**[[DCAs are a novel form of defense cooperation]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
At their core, [these [agreements establish long-term]{.mark}
institutional [frameworks for routine]{.mark} [bilateral defense
relations]{.mark}, including coordination of defense policies, joint
military exercises, working groups]{.underline} and committees,
[training and educational exchanges,]{.underline} defense-related
[research and development, and procurement]{.underline}. As frameworks,
DCAs reserve specific details of implementation for protocols and
implementing legislation. This [flexibility means [DCAs can]{.mark} both
[improve traditional]{.mark} defense [capabilities and
address]{.mark}]{.underline} [such]{.underline} protean [[nontraditional
threats as]{.mark} terrorism, trafficking, piracy, and **[cyber
security]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Importantly, **[[DCAs contain no mutual
defense]{.mark} or nonaggression [obligations. They are not
alliances]{.mark}]{.underline}**. And unlike the forms of defense
cooperation that dominated great-power politics during the Cold War,
[they are typically highly symmetric, mutually committing signatories to
a common set of guidelines]{.underline}.

### 1NC/2NC \-\-- DCAs Spill-Over

#### DCAs spill over -- they facilitate trust and cooperation which creates favorable conditions for more DCAs

In developing a comprehensive theory of DCA formation, I synthesize
cooperation theory with network-analytic insights.7 [States cooperate in
order to obtain joint gains]{.underline}.8 Exogenous macro-level [shifts
in the global security environment]{.underline}--- including the
collapse of the Soviet Union, the decline in interstate war, and the
growth of nontraditional security threats---have [increased the joint
gains of defense cooperation and thus **increased demand for
DCAs**]{.underline}. These systemwide trends translate into specific
dyadic influences. Faced with an increasingly complex security
environment, [states use DCAs to (1) modernize their militaries and
improve]{.underline} their [defense capacities, (2) improve coordinated
responses to]{.underline} common [security threats, and (3) align
themselves with]{.underline} communities of [like-minded
collaborators.]{.underline} At the dyadic level, [demand for DCAs
depends on whether potential partners can help one another
meet]{.underline} these [goals]{.underline}.

However, joint gains tell only part of the story. Even when demand for
cooperation is high, [information asymmetries may limit the supply of
cooperative institutions. States]{.underline} often [lack credible
information about one another's trustworthiness, or willingness to
cooperate]{.underline} rather than exploit the cooperation of others for
unilateral benefit.9 [Because DCAs involve sensitive national security
issues]{.underline}, including access to classified information,
coordination of defense policies, and proliferation of sophisticated
weapons technologies, [they inherently involve issues of trust.
States]{.underline} further may [lack information about one another's
institutional design preferences]{.underline}, such as the preferred
scope and precision of formal agreements, [which leads to distributional
conflicts]{.underline}.10 [**If states are unsure of others'
trustworthiness**]{.underline} or unsure about the types of agreements
others are willing to sign, the supply of **[DCAs will remain
low]{.underline}**.

The logic of joint gains thus does not explain how, despite persistent
mistrust and distributional conflicts, states have managed to sharply
increase their participation in DCAs. I argue that [when governments
create DCAs, they reveal information about their trustworthiness and
their preferred]{.underline} institutional [designs to third-party
observers. **This information subsequently** **ameliorates cooperation
problems for others, creating favorable conditions for new
DCAs**]{.underline}. In short, [DCAs involve network influence---
**relations between one pair of states affect relations between
others**]{.underline}**.** I consider two specific types of network
influence: preferential attachment, where highly active states or "hubs"
in the network endogenously attract new partners, and triadic closure,
where states that share DCA ties with the same third parties or "friends
of friends" are more likely to cooperate directly. These [network
influences are empirically observable reflections of the underlying
informational value of the ties of others]{.underline}.11

While network influences have been documented previously in
international relations,12 I extend those insights by focusing more
directly on causal mechanisms. Placebo-like tests, combined with
extensive assessment of testable implications, show that the influence
of triadic closure and preferential attachment varies according to the
quality of governments' informational environment, which strongly
suggests that network influences indeed depend on an informational
mechanism. More generally, the empirical analysis indicates that,
post-Cold War, [network influences quickly became the driving force
behind DCA proliferation]{.underline}. Out-of-sample predictions show
that [although exogenous]{.underline} dyadic [factors and corresponding
shifts]{.underline} in the global security environment [are important
determinants of defense cooperation, network influences dramatically
improve our ability to predict who signs DCAs, and when.]{.underline}
Exogenous influences may stimulate demand, but **[network influences
ensure supply]{.underline}**.

### 2NC \-\-- Competition

#### DCAs are [framework]{.underline} treaties that are [distinct]{.underline} from [mutual defense]{.underline} alliances like NATO

**Kinne '18** -- Associate professor of political science at the
University of California, Davis whose research explores international
networks in the areas of militarized conflict, intergovernmental
organization, and bilateral cooperation (Brandon, International
Organization, "Defense Cooperation Agreements and the Emergence of a

The [universe of defense agreements is large]{.underline}. Treaty
records reveal agreements on everything from war cemeteries to nuclear
materials to military cartography. The vast majority of these agreements
focus narrowly on specific threats or issues, and many follow from
unique historical events, such as wars, occupations, state failures, or
colonialism. Glaring asymmetries are common, and few agreements are long
term. [**[DCAs are]{.mark} different**. I define DCAs]{.underline}
**[simply as [formal bilateral agreements that establish institutional
frameworks for routine defense cooperation.]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[[DCAs]{.mark} typically [involve]{.mark}]{.underline} relatively
[[symmetric, long-term commitments]{.mark} for both sides, [with an
emphasis on coordinating]{.mark} core areas of [defense policy]{.mark}
and encouraging interpersonal contacts.]{.underline} A 2006 DCA between
France and India illustrates:

1.1 The purpose of the Agreement is to promote cooperation between the
Parties in the defence and military fields, defence industry,
production, research and development, and procurement of defence
materiel.

1.2 This Agreement shall establish a framework which aims to cover all
cooperation activities conducted by the Parties in the field of defence.

1.3 The forms of such cooperation may be specifically defined by way of
agreements between the relevant minstries of the Parties.Footnote 13

Beyond this basic definition, [DCAs exhibit specific characteristics.
First]{.underline}, as Article 1.2 suggests, [**[DCAs are framework
treaties]{.mark}.** A framework is "[a legally binding treaty]{.mark}
... [that establishes broad commitments]{.mark} for its parties [and
a]{.mark} general [system of governance, while
leaving]{.mark}]{.underline} more [[detail]{.mark}ed rule[s]{.mark} and
the setting of specific targets]{.underline} either [[to subsequent
agreements]{.mark} between the parties]{.underline}, usually referred to
as protocols, or to national legislation."Footnote 14 For example,
although [DCAs]{.underline} often touch on arms trade, the agreements
themselves [establish only general procedures for procurement and
acquisition. Execution of contracts requires subsequent
instruments]{.underline}. As Article 1.3 indicates, much implementation
occurs separately. Accordingly, leaders often describe [DCAs as "legal
umbrellas" for defense cooperation]{.underline}.Footnote 15

Second, [[DCAs emphasize]{.mark} day-to-day [interactions in core
defense]{.mark} areas]{.underline}, which typically include [(1) mutual
consultation and defense policy coordination; (2) joint exercises,
training, and education; (3) coordination in peacekeeping operations;
(4) defense-related r]{.underline}esearch [and d]{.underline}evelopment;
[(5) defense industrial cooperation; (6) weapons procurement; and (7)
security of classified information. The primary [goal]{.mark} of
DCAs]{.underline}, then, [[is to encourage]{.underline}]{.mark}
substantive [[cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark} [in these]{.underline}
core [areas]{.underline}. Importantly, **[[DCAs do not include mutual
defense commitments]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Public officials often
emphasize this fact. Indonesia\'s defense minister, following a
controversial 2007 DCA with China, made this clear: "We only want to
improve our defense cooperation with China. We have no intention of
signing a defense treaty with China."Footnote 16

Third, [[DCAs]{.mark} commonly [establish **bilateral**]{.mark}
committees]{.underline}, working [groups, and other [mechanisms to
encourage coop]{.mark}eration]{.underline}. The France-India DCA created
the High Committee on Defence Cooperation, tasked with "defining,
organizing, and coordinating bilateral cooperation activities."Footnote
17 [Many DCAs]{.underline} also [require signatories to
develop]{.underline} annual [defense cooperation plans]{.underline} that
detail summits, policy goals, exercises, exchanges, and pending
contracts. An illustrative 2011 DCA between Czech Republic and Moldova
stipulates that "[[the Parties]{.mark} shall work out and
[approve]{.mark} annually **[bilateral cooperation
plans]{.mark}**]{.underline}," which "shall be worked out by 1 December
of the current year."Footnote 18

Fourth, [the language and content of the agreements]{.underline}
themselves [are highly symmetric]{.underline}, using phrases such as
"the Parties" and "the Signatories" in lieu of proper nouns. While
[asymmetries]{.underline} of course exist in implementation (for
example, because of relative power), these [are separate from the
treaties]{.underline} themselves [and best addressed with control
variables]{.underline}. Fifth, [DCAs are long-term agreements, with a
modal length of ten years. Many DCAs are indefinite]{.underline}.

A final important characteristic is that [defense partners frequently
sign multiple DCAs]{.underline}. They may, for example, replace a prior
agreement, or they may simply prefer a piecemeal approach, where they
address issue-areas in separate agreements rather than in a single
general agreement. In practice, over the 1980--2010 period, about half
of countries that signed a DCA subsequently signed at least one more.
These subsequent **[[DCAs are novel legal instruments, not]{.mark}
merely [amendments]{.mark}]{.underline}**. I later capitalize on this
feature of DCAs to improve causal inference.

**[Together, these [characteristics define DCAs as a distinct form of
cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The appendix further describes how
[[DCAs differ from defense]{.mark} and nonaggression [pacts]{.mark}, as
well as]{.underline} status of [forces agreements]{.underline} (SOFAs),
[strategic partnerships, and]{.underline} confidence-building measures
([CBMs]{.underline}). It also includes a full-text example of a DCA.
Between DCAs, [the primary source of heterogeneity is issue scope.
[Some]{.mark} agreements]{.underline}, like the France-India DCA,
[[cover all possible areas]{.mark}]{.underline} of defense cooperation.
[[Others are narrower]{.underline}]{.mark}, only partly covering the
core issue areas I described. For example, countries may sign one DCA on
mutual consultation and another on defense industry cooperation.
[Governments]{.underline} nonetheless [recognize these narrower
agreements as elements of a larger defense framework]{.underline};
indeed, [they often use general DCAs to pull together]{.underline}
various [piecemeal efforts.]{.underline} When Bangladesh and China
signed a DCA in 2002, their respective prime ministers described the
need to "institutionalize the existing accords in defence sector and
also to rationalize the existing piecemeal agreements to enhance
cooperation in training, maintenance and in some areas of
production."Footnote 19 Whether [DCAs]{.underline} take the form of one
agreement or a package of agreements, they [move toward the singular
goal of an institutionalized defense framework]{.underline}. I explore
DCA heterogeneity in the appendix and show that the empirical results
are robust even when restricting the analysis to the most general DCAs.

International defense cooperation is a complex, heterogeneous

[[are]{.mark} ambitious agreements that establish [institutional

of [their signatories' cooperative defense activities. [DCAs promote
**substantive**]{.mark},]{.underline} routine, [day-to- day
[interactions]{.mark} between governments, militaries,]{.underline}
defense [industries, and other actors [relevant to global
security]{.mark}]{.underline}. Not only have [DCAs exploded in number in
recent decades]{.underline}, but anecdotal [evidence suggests that
**[governments view DCAs as essential elements of their global security
strategies]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Preliminary statistical evidence
further suggests that [[DCAs]{.underline}]{.mark} may [**[have]{.mark}
[tangible effects on a wide range of activities]{.mark},** from arms
trade to peackeeping to bilateral lending and militarized interstate
disputes]{.underline} (cf. Kinne 2016, 2018; Kinne and Bunte 2018).

Browsing the "military matters" category of the UNTS reveals agreements
on military cemeteries, radar stations, tobacco use by military
personnel, and various other topics. Even seemingly trivial defense
agreements are numerous. Accordingly, [[I distinguish DCAs
from]{.underline}]{.mark} those [defense agreements that have previously
received]{.underline} scholarly [attention, such as]{.underline}
nonaggression pacts, [[mutual defense pacts]{.mark},]{.underline}
strategic partnerships, and status-of-forces agreements (SOFAs).

[Defense]{.underline} pacts [and nonaggression pacts]{.underline} have
been heavily studied (e.g., Gibler 2009; Mattes and Vonnahme 2010; Walt
1987). Leeds, Ritter, Mitchell, and Long (2002) place [both]{.underline}
agreement types [under the broader definition of a military
alliance]{.underline}:

Alliances are written agreements, signed by official representatives of
at least two inde- pendent states, that include promises to aid a
partner in the event of military conflict, to remain neutral in the
event of conflict, to refrain from military conflict with one another,
or to consult/cooperate in the event of international crises that create
a potential for military conflict.

[[Alliances focus]{.mark} primarily [on conflict]{.mark}]{.underline},
especially of the interstate variety. **[[By contrast, DCAs exclusively
address]{.mark} issues of [cooperation]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Of
course, these substantive focuses may overlap. Alliances may require
cooperation in order to achieve their goal of minimizing or preventing
conflict. Indeed, some alliances promote forms of cooperation---working
groups, exercises, training and exchange---that overlap with DCAs. Yet,
[while conflict-related obligations are a necessary condition for
alliances, additional provisions regarding cooperative activities are
not. **[DCAs]{.mark}**]{.underline}, on the other hand, [[are defined
precisely by their goal of i]{.mark}nstitutionalizing [routine
cooperative]{.mark} defense [activities]{.mark}]{.underline}. Indeed,
**[[DCAs]{.mark} overtly [exclude the mutual defense commitments that
define alliances]{.mark} as such]{.underline}**.15

[Even when [alliances]{.mark} discuss cooperation more generally, they
[do not engender umbrella]{.mark} [frameworks]{.mark} for]{.underline}
the full range of [states' defense]{.underline} activities. Provisions
on peacetime cooperation are in fact uncommon outside of ambitious
alliances like NATO. Leeds et al. (2002) find that while about half of
alliances involve mutual consultation[, less than 15% mandate
interpersonal contact during peacetime]{.underline}. And while many
alliances encourage "economic cooperation, protection of minorities,
scientific or cultural exchange, environmental protection, etc.," these
activities are overtly non- military (Leeds 2005: 30[). [**By
contrast**, **routine activities**]{.mark} like joint exercises, officer
exchanges, procurement and acquisition, joint weapons collaborations,
and defense industrial cooperation **[are the core purview of
DCAs.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[[**The distinction between alliances and DCAs is straightforward.**
The]{.mark} primary [goal of an alliance is to specify obligations
contingent on armed conflict. The]{.mark} primary [goal of a DCA is to
establish]{.mark} generic [frameworks for routine cooperative]{.mark}
defense [activities**. The two agreement**]{.mark} **type[s]{.mark}
[are]{.mark} [mutually exclusive. Alliance and DCA obligations
are]{.mark}**]{.underline} also **[[empirically
distinct]{.underline}]{.mark}**. At the dyad-year level, [the
correlation between DCAs and alliances is typically less than 0.2. The
vast **majority of [DCA partners lack a direct alliance of any
form]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

first **[skirmish involves the word \"the.\"]{.underline}** The claim
language states \"circuitry for recycling the magnetizing energy stored

that the claim allows for the possibility that some of the energy may be
recycled \[\*\*10\] to reset the core while other energy is delivered to
the load. In other words, it argues that **[the word \"the\" can mean
\"some]{.underline}** of the,\" and explains that the word \"the\" was
used to distinguish \"the magnetizing\" energy from the more general
term \"energy\" that is used earlier in the preamble. **[Nice linguistic
jousting]{.underline}**, but the use of the word \"magnetizing\" alone
would have been an adequate adjective to single out the kind of energy
intended for recycling. **[[If only some]{.underline}]{.mark}** of the

**[Lambda\'s argument that the word \"[the\" connotes]{.mark}

definition of \"**[[the]{.underline}]{.mark}**\" as: \"**[used as a

invention that recycles all of the magnetizing energy to reset the

Do DCAs matter? Related work explores DCAs as an independent variable.20
Here, I briefly presage those findings. Diplomatic correspondence
reveals that [[states]{.mark} increasingly [view **traditional
military**]{.mark} **[alliances as inadequate]{.mark}** to the current
global security environment]{.underline}. Shortly after the election of
Nicolas Sarkozy in 2007, US diplomats reported that the new
[[French]{.mark} government [considered its alliances]{.mark} with
African governments to be "patently [absurd and out of
date]{.mark}]{.underline}."21 [[France sought to]{.mark} "radically
[convert the present system]{.mark} of defense agreements]{.underline},"
which were mostly traditional postcolonial defense pacts, and focus
instead on "combating illicit trafficking and terrorist acts," while
also encouraging "cooperation on defense and security, favoring the rise
in strength of African capacities to carry out peacekeeping."22 [African
leaders]{.underline} supported these shifts. Comoros, for example,
[argued for a "new military cooperation arrangement]{.underline} with
France," [[focusing not on]{.mark} traditional [mutual
defense]{.mark}]{.underline} issues, [but [on "**training and
exchange**]{.mark} **programs**]{.underline}."23

[[Leaders]{.underline}]{.mark} also [frequently [tout the material
benefits of DCAs]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} For example, [the 2011
annual plan between [France and Estonia]{.mark} "lays down]{.underline}
nearly [twenty]{.underline} different [activities," varying from
"training]{.underline} of Estonian air force ground intercept
controllers["]{.underline} to "participation of French ships in the
Baltops and Open Spirit [exercises]{.underline}" to "admitting a French
student to the Baltic Defense College."24 [[Russia]{.mark}'s defense
minister boasted that the 2016]{.underline} annual [plan [with
Belarus]{.mark} "stipulates over 130]{.underline} events and
[measures]{.underline}."25 According to Indonesia's national news
agency, [[Indonesia]{.mark}'s]{.underline} numerous [DCAs have allowed
it to obtain]{.underline} Sukhoi [fighters and]{.underline} Mi-17
[helicopters from Russia]{.underline}, platform dock [ships and
sub]{.underline}marine[s]{.underline} [from [South Korea,
and]{.mark}]{.underline} C-802 [missiles from
[China]{.mark}]{.underline}.26 And [a 2008 DCA between [Latvia and
Norway]{.mark} allowed Latvia to increase its peacekeeping presence in
Afghanistan and coordinate with Norwegian command]{.underline}.27

\[figure omitted\]

[These historical [anecdotes accord with statistical
patterns]{.mark}]{.underline}. Figure 2 illustrates the relationship
between DCAs and a host of defense and security outcomes. The figure
shows that [[after signing a DCA, dyads are more likely to]{.mark}
jointly [contribute to peacekeeping]{.mark} missions]{.underline}; more
likely to [[collaborate in]{.mark} joint military
[exercises]{.mark}]{.underline}; more likely to [collaborate on the same
side of a militarized interstate dispute]{.underline} (MID); [[less

in]{.mark} arms [trade; an]{.mark}]{.underline}[d]{.mark} more likely to
**[[have cooperative interactions overall]{.underline}]{.mark}**, as
defined by the Integrated Crisis Early Warning System (ICEWS). Related
work employs a battery of network selection and coevolution models to
address potential omitted variables, reverse causation, statistical
dependencies, and other threats to inference, and finds that [the basic
patterns shown]{.underline} in Figure 2 [are extremely
robust]{.underline}.28 In short, **[[DCAs have a powerful impact on
defense and security outcomes]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**[[Governments]{.mark} increasingly [turn to DCAs as a means of
improving their military capacity]{.mark}]{.underline}**. For example,
[[Bulgaria]{.mark} has [waged a modernization campaign]{.mark} since the
1990s, [involving dozens of DCAs]{.mark} that,]{.underline} according to
US diplomats, [are "based on the premise that Bulgaria faces new
asymmetrical security threats]{.underline} rather than traditional
threats to its national territory."57 In 2011, [[Indonesia pursued
DCAs]{.mark} with a wide swath of partners]{.underline}---including
Russia, South Korea, China, Serbia, and India---[in an effort [to
"modernize]{.mark} the country's main [armament
system]{.mark}]{.underline}."58 [Modernization]{.underline} also
[[includes R&D and industrial coop]{.mark}eration]{.underline}. In 2005,
Ukraine's defense minister argued that a DCA with Russia would
capitalize on the "scientific and industrial potentials of Ukraine and
Russia" and enable "co-production arrangements for defense-industry
enterprises in the development and production of armaments and military
hardware."59 Officer [exchanges and training programs
comprise]{.underline} yet [another source of military
capacity]{.underline}. A defense official from the Philippines,
following a 2006 agreement with Australia, observed: "It's like a
basketball game. [We need to practise with other players from other
teams to learn new skills]{.underline} and techniques [to raise the
level of our game]{.underline}."60 The defense minister averred, "[In
three years, we [could raise]{.mark} the [military's readiness from
**45**]{.mark} **percent [to 70 percent]{.mark}**]{.underline}."61

[[States respond]{.mark} not merely to global threats but [to **threats
shared in common**]{.mark}]{.underline} with potential partners. For
example, the Grand Mufti of Brunei argued for a DCA with Indonesia by
appealing to a sense of shared fate, declaring that "in the future, we
will likely face nontraditional threats, which do not recognize state
borders. **[[It is thus a must for two]{.mark} neighboring [countries to
set up military cooperations]{.mark}]{.underline}**."62
[Indonesia]{.underline}'s defense minister [explained his country's 2016
DCA with Sweden by stating that "our common enemy is
terrorism]{.underline}."63 Although asymmetric threats receive
disproportionate attention, [[leaders]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[retain
concerns about traditional interstate threats]{.underline}]{.mark}. The
defense ministers of [Iran and Syria described a 2006 DCA as a response
to the "common threat" posed by the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [and Israel]{.underline}.64 [Iran]{.underline}'s
defense minister similarly [declared that [a 2005
DCA]{.mark}]{.underline} with Tajikistan [[would "deter]{.mark} foreign
[forces who aim to find a foothold]{.mark} in the region on the pretext
of restoring security]{.underline}."65

Scholars have long argued that [[states use]{.mark} defense [ties to
signal affinity with]{.mark} particular
[collaborators]{.mark}]{.underline}.66 A Brazilian military analyst,
explaining the 2010 DCA with the US, argued that "[Brazil is aligning
itself]{.underline} strategically [with the US, like the European
nations have done with NATO,]{.underline}" while Secretary of Defense
Robert Gates described [the deal as "a formal acknowledgement of
the]{.underline} many [security interests and values we
share]{.underline}."67 At their most ambitious, [[alignment efforts
coalesce into]{.mark} **nascent
[communitie]{.mark}**]{.underline}**[s]{.mark}**.68 [[Upon signing a DCA
with Chile]{.underline}]{.mark} in 2012, [[the Canadian government
reiterated]{.mark} a commitment to ["working with like-minded nations to
promote peace and security]{.mark}]{.underline} throughout the
Americas."69 In 2012, [a [Philippines]{.mark} senator argued that a [DCA
with Australia]{.mark}]{.underline}---[complementing DCAs with
[So]{.mark}uth [Ko]{.mark}rea, [Japan, Australia, New Zealand]{.mark},
[Singapore, and Indonesia]{.mark}]{.underline}---[[would finalize a
**pan-Asian "security umbrella**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}"70 And
Secretary Ash Carter's farewell memo describes the above-mentioned
principled [[security network]{.underline}]{.mark} as "open to all that
seek to [**preserve and [strengthen]{.mark} the rules and [norms
that]{.mark} have [undergird]{.mark}ed [regional
stability]{.mark}**]{.underline} for the past seven decades."71

### 2NC \-\-- Solvency \-\-- Russia/Cyber

#### [Bilat]{.underline} DCAs are [key]{.underline} -- solves [Russian]{.underline} aggression and [cyber]{.underline} warfare

In the years since, [[US]{.mark} defense policy [has]{.mark} evolved [to
manage an increasingly complex security
environment]{.mark}]{.underline}. US Secretary of Defense Ash
[Carter]{.underline} recently [articulated the need for a "principled
security network," of which **[bilateral defense agreements are]{.mark}
a [key]{.mark} component**]{.underline}.55 [This [network would]{.mark}
[address]{.mark} both [traditional concerns]{.mark}]{.underline} (for
example, "**[[Russian aggression]{.underline}]{.mark}** from the east")
[[and new threats like]{.mark} terrorism, piracy, refugee flows,
humanitarian assistance, natural disasters, and **[cyber
warfare]{.mark}**]{.underline}.56 In short, [[the new]{.mark} global
security [environment]{.mark} has [increased demand]{.mark} for novel
forms of cooperation. Governments do not]{.underline} simply [sign DCAs
wantonly]{.underline}. States differ in their exposure to novel security
threats, and [**[partnerships]{.mark} with some states [offer more
promise in managing]{.mark} these [threats]{.mark}** than
others]{.underline}. I employ historical accounts to identify three
related but analytically distinct pressures on bilateral demand for
defense cooperation. Subsequently, I translate these bilateral
influences into a series of control variables.

### 2NC \-\-- Solvency \-\-- General

#### DCAs are [proliferating]{.underline}, but maintaining [compliance]{.underline} is [insufficient]{.underline} -- [creating]{.underline} new ones is key

**Kinne '18** -- Associate professor of political science at the
University of California, Davis whose research explores international

organization, and bilateral cooperation (Brandon, International

)//RG

[Exogenously motivated demands for defense cooperation]{.underline},
though important, [do not explain how states]{.underline} have managed
to [overcome]{.underline} the [information asymmetries that plague
cooperative efforts]{.underline}. While some powerful, wealthy
governments may be willing to risk cooperation despite uncertainty,
[**[DCAs have proliferated]{.mark} far [beyond the powerful and
wealthy]{.mark}**[. Even former adversaries]{.mark}]{.underline} like
Australia and Indonesia, Brazil and Argentina, and Ukraine and Russia
[[have]{.mark} now [signed DCAs]{.mark}.]{.underline} I argue that [when
states sign DCAs, they reveal information about their trustworthiness
and]{.underline} design [preferences to third-party observers, and those
revelations]{.underline} in turn [drive empirically observable network
influences. [As]{.mark}]{.underline} the density of [[the DCA network
increases]{.mark}, network influences multiply. [Info]{.mark}rmation
[about]{.mark} the [trustworthiness and]{.mark}]{.underline}
institutional design [[preferences of]{.mark} prospective [partners
becomes]{.mark} more readily [available]{.mark}]{.underline}, merely
supplementary. Post-Cold War, **[[they are]{.underline}]{.mark}** in
fact **[[the primary determinants of new DCAs]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

I thus operationalize [[DCAs as a global network]{.mark}, where a
network is]{.underline} simply [a collection of]{.underline} "nodes"
(that is, [countries) connected to one another via]{.underline} "edges"
(that is, [DCAs]{.underline}), and where the edges, though separable,
are not independent of one another. The probability of a tie between a
given i and j is then endogenous to the probability of a tie between i
and k, or k and j, or k and l, and so on. Figure 4 illustrates the DCA
network in Asia in 2010. As a network, the probability of any given edge
is a function, in part, of other edges in the network, which defines the
phenomenon of network influence. Conditional on the various exogenous
influences discussed previously, [the probability of a DCA]{.underline}
between a given i and j [depends on who else has signed
DCAs.]{.underline}

In theorizing network influences, I focus on the capacity of [[DCA
creation]{.mark} itself]{.underline} to [[signal info]{.mark}rmation
[to]{.mark} observant [third parties. I emphasize **DCA
creation**]{.mark}**---[rather than compliance]{.mark}**]{.underline}
with DCAs **[[over time]{.underline}]{.mark}**---for three reasons.
[First]{.underline}, although DCAs often incorporate "trust-building"
measures, [[ex ante trust remains]{.mark}]{.underline} a
[[necessary]{.underline}]{.mark} condition. [Second, [even if compliance
increases]{.mark} ex post [trust]{.mark}, these [effects may not be
measurable]{.mark}. Some DCA activities]{.underline}---sharing of
classified information, joint military research, defense policy
coordination---[are difficult to observe. Third, [DCAs reveal
info]{.mark}rmation [about]{.mark}]{.underline} scope, depth, and other
institutional [[design issues]{.underline}]{.mark} immediately upon
signature, [[regardless of compliance]{.underline}]{.mark}. Nonetheless,
I later identify areas where ex post trust, generated by observed
compliance, further strengthens network influences, particularly when
mediators are involved.

[D]{.underline}efense [c]{.underline}ooperation
[a]{.underline}greement[s]{.underline} [are an exciting new
phenomenon.]{.underline} Nearly [[as many countries]{.mark} now
[participate in DCAs as in traditional]{.mark} military
[alliances]{.mark}. The shifting global security environment has
generated demand for new forms of defense cooperation.]{.underline}
However, [[states]{.mark} continue to [face]{.mark}]{.underline}
long-standing [[cooperation problems]{.underline}]{.mark}, such as
informational asymmetries and distributional conflicts, [which dampen
willingness to cooperate]{.underline} and lead to an undersupply of
defense agreements. [[A comprehensive approach to DCAs]{.mark}
reinforces]{.underline} the important role of [exogenous security
influences while also emphasizing]{.underline} the importance of
[network influences. The DCA network [helps to]{.mark} **endogenously
[alleviate cooperation problems]{.mark}** [and **encourage otherwise
chary states to sign agreements**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In-depth
empirical analysis shows not only that [these [network effects are **key
drivers of defense cooperation**]{.mark}]{.underline}, but that the
network effects themselves likely derive from informational mechanisms.
[States respond to the ties of others]{.underline} precisely [because
those ties reveal strategically valuable information about trust,
reliability, and institutional design preferences.]{.underline}

The study of [[DCAs promise]{.underline}]{.mark}s [[fruitful insights
on]{.mark} contemporary internatonal [security]{.mark}.]{.underline} I
consider three avenues of future research to be especially promising.
First, [the substantive impact of DCAs deserves
consideration.]{.underline} Voluminous anecdotal evidence shows that
[**[governments take DCAs very seriously]{.mark}**---an insight
[reinforced by the dramatic proliferation of DCAs]{.mark}]{.underline}
over the past two decades. And [DCAs often espouse ambitious goals, such
as the coordination of the entirety of t]{.underline}heir respective
signatories' [defense relations]{.underline}. Yet we know relatively
little about how DCAs accomplish these goals. Figure 2 shows that
[**[the]{.mark} potential [impact of DCAs is wide
ranging]{.mark}**[,]{.mark} involving arms trade, defense spending,
joint military exercises, training and exchange, and militarized
conflicts]{.underline}.

Second, [variation in the scope of DCAs raises questions of
institutional design]{.underline}. In some cases, states assemble a
single general defense framework. In other cases, states assemble
multiple DCAs in piecemeal fashion. What explains the choice between
these two options? [Institutional design concerns permeate
DCAs]{.underline}, including questions of treaty duration, ease of
termination, prospects for renewal, and, of course, scope. Are these
features a consequence of regime type, development, pre-existing legal
commitments, or other influences? Might these design features themselves
be potentially endogenous to the network? I have argued [that network
ties convey information on design preferences, which suggests that
particular institutional features]{.underline} may [diffuse throughout
the network and]{.underline}, via this diffusion process, [emerge as
equilibrium design choices for states.]{.underline} That is, [not only
do [pre-existing DCA ties **encourage the formation of new
DCAs**;]{.mark} they might also encourage the formation of specific
types of DCAs]{.underline}.

Defense cooperation has long intrigued scholars of international
relations. Thucydides' History of the Peloponnesian War is, perhaps most
of all, a treatise on alliance politics. Like Thucydides, [contemporary
scholars have focused heavily on formal military
alliances]{.underline}---and have produced a formidable literature.1
Yet, [[governments rarely sign]{.mark} new [alliances]{.mark}, and the
global alliance structure has remained relatively static]{.underline}
for decades. While alliance-making experienced a resurgence in the
immediate aftermath of the Soviet Union's collapse, [only a dozen new
alliances have emerged since 9/11---most of them]{.underline} ententes
or [nonaggression pacts rather than mutual defense pacts]{.underline}
(Gibler 2009).

[[When governments pursue cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark} in defense,
military, and [security]{.underline} issues, [[they]{.mark} increasingly
[turn]{.mark} not to alliances, but [to]{.mark}]{.underline} a type of
framework treaty known as [[a]{.underline}]{.mark} defense cooperation
agreement, or [[DCA]{.mark}. **Nearly [always bilateral, DCAs establish
broad legal umbrellas]{.mark}** [for]{.mark} the range of [cooperative
defense activities]{.mark}]{.underline} in which states might engage[,
from coordinating defense policies to]{.underline} conducting [joint
exercises to]{.underline} jointly producing [weapons and
technology]{.underline}. In short, [[DCAs facilitate the routine
interactions that]{.mark} [comprise]{.mark} day-to-day defense
[cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline}. Taken as a whole, [these agreements
provide insight into the]{.underline} pragmatic [tools]{.underline} that
[governments have developed to address]{.underline} the [complex
threats,]{.underline} both interstate and nontraditional, [that define
the contemporary global security environment]{.underline}.

The distinctions between DCAs and other agreement types are apparent in
their institutional characteristics. **[[While alliances
focus]{.underline}]{.mark}** primarily [**[on contingencies surrounding
conflict, DCAs exclusively address cooperation]{.mark}.** They contain
no mutual defense]{.underline} or nonaggression
[commitments]{.underline}. Indeed, [most DCA partners lack a formal
alliance altogether. [DCAs]{.mark} also [fundamentally differ
from]{.mark}]{.underline} status of forces agreements, strategic
partnerships, and [[other]{.mark}]{.underline} commonly studied [defense
[agreements]{.mark}.]{.underline} And unlike these other agreement
types, [DCAs have proliferated rapidly. [DCAs are]{.mark}]{.underline}
often [[extensive and ambitious]{.underline}]{.mark} in scope,
[[implementing]{.mark} institutional [frameworks]{.mark} for the
entirety of their signatories' cooperative defense
relations]{.underline}. [They]{.underline} also [tend to be]{.underline}
relatively [symmetric]{.underline} in the commitments they impose on
signatories, and they endure for periods of 5--10 years or longer.

Anecdotal **[[evidence of DCAs' significance
abounds]{.underline}]{.mark}**. After the loss of its Soviet sponsor in
the early 1990s, [Mongolia deployed]{.underline} a web of nearly [[three
dozen DCAs]{.mark} to [ensure access to]{.mark} defense-related
[training, education]{.mark}, materiel, [weapons,]{.mark} and
[research]{.mark}.]{.underline}2 A historic [2014 DCA between Russia and
Pakistan led to arms transfers, counterterror drills, joint antidrug
exercises]{.underline} in the Arabian Sea, and even the participation of
a Pakistani warship in Russia's Navy Day parade.3 More generally, Kinne
(2018) shows that [[DCAs]{.mark} [increase]{.mark} the frequency of
joint military exercises, contributions to peacekeeping]{.underline}
missions [and multilateral uses of force, arms trade, and [overall
cooperative bilateral events, while reducing]{.mark} the frequency
of]{.underline} militarized [[disputes]{.mark}. In short, **[DCAs
are]{.mark} now [central to governments' defense
strategies]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[If states lack sufficient ex ante trust]{.underline} (that is, prior to

Unsurprisingly, [the language of [trust permeates DCA

controversial 1995 [[DCA]{.mark} [with Indonesia]{.mark} reflected
the]{.underline} new [reality that Australia "no longer sees Indonesia
as a]{.underline}n expansionist [threat]{.underline}." [Australian Prime

Suharto [echoed the sentiment]{.underline}, asserting that "if there is
still suspicion about Indonesia, then it should be eliminated."43
[Because trust is a necessary condition for defense cooperation, **[the
creation of a DCA functions as a reassuring signal of cooperative

**[[DCAs]{.underline}]{.mark}** also **[[increase ex post
trust]{.underline}]{.mark}**. For example, [the defense minister of
[Iran referred to]{.mark}]{.underline} his country's [2002 [DCA with

phrase that appears repeatedly in leaders' statements and]{.underline}
in the texts of [DCAs themselves]{.underline}.44 The prime ministers of
[[China and India made this]{.underline}]{.mark} logic
[[explicit]{.mark} in a joint public statement on their 2005 DCA, noting
that "broadening and deepening of defense]{.underline} exchanges between

Fourth, traditional military alliances exercise influence in a variety
of ways. Allied countries are better equipped to meet one another's
modernization needs, more likely to face common threats, and more likely
to share foreign-policy goals. Thus, [[alliances]{.underline}]{.mark}
should generally [[increase demand for DCAs]{.mark}.]{.underline}
However, I anticipate [a [unique]{.mark} influence [for NATO]{.mark}
because its]{.underline} unusually [broad mandate spills into issue
areas]{.underline}---training, defense research, joint exercises,
etc.---[also addressed by DCAs]{.underline}. Accordingly, [demand for
DCAs should be lower between NATO states]{.underline}. At the same time,
because **[[DCAs are]{.mark} an [important]{.mark} mechanism [for

anticipate a positive effect for pairings between NATO members and

[[Coordination problems are]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[apparent in
DCAs. Variations in]{.underline}]{.mark} the institutional
[[characteristics]{.underline}]{.mark} of DCAs partially [[reflect
distributional concerns]{.mark}. Governments worry about]{.underline}
[asymmetric gains]{.underline}---that is, the possibility that one's
partners will gain more than oneself.47 Further, [negotiators know that
revealing a preference for]{.underline} particular design [features may
lead others to increase their demands]{.underline} accordingly. Given
these incentives, [governments anticipate that their interlocutors may
not be fully transparent]{.underline} about their treaty preferences.
**[That [uncertainty]{.mark},]{.underline}** in turn, **[[increases the
risk of bargaining failure]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Given their broad
flexibility as framework agreements, [[DCAs]{.mark} particularly [raise
concerns about **scope, precision, and**]{.mark} **the [degree of
reliance]{.mark}** on implementing arrangements]{.underline}.

A contentious 2007 negotiation between [[Singapore and Indonesia]{.mark}
offers an illuminating example.]{.underline} In response to Singapore's
request for access to Indonesian waters for training purposes, [the
resulting [DCA included a seemingly]{.mark} [benign]{.mark} implementing
[arrangement]{.mark}]{.underline} that designated an "Area Bravo"
southwest of Indonesia's Natuna Islands.48 Almost
[immediately]{.underline} upon signature of the DCA, [[Indonesian
politicians accused Singapore of disingenuousness]{.mark} and began
speculating on the "broad latitude" that the Singapore military would
wield]{.underline} in Area Bravo, involving naval exercises, air
support, live fire, and even participation of third parties---[all of
which]{.underline}, given Singapore's growing military strength,
[would]{.underline} likely [intensify over time]{.underline}.49
[Indonesia's defense minister, seizing on ambiguities]{.underline}
within the agreement, [declared that "Singapore still wants rules of
their own, without having to negotiate]{.underline} \... on their
military training here."50 He further asserted, "We want clear rules of
the game on the frequency and scope of Singapore military training,
including how many times Singapore can fire its missiles in our
territory."51 While Singapore's true preferences remain opaque, **[[the
mere perception of duplicity]{.mark} by the Indonesian government [was
sufficient to doom the proceedings]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

exchange classified information, hold joint exercises, and]{.underline}
so on, they [engage in]{.underline} inherently [risky activities [that

the [improvements in military capacity]{.underline} that DCAs

Although Trump has now left office, **[NATO is]{.underline}**
nonetheless **[in for difficult times]{.underline}**, as strategic
circumstances change and China's rise draws American attention toward
East Asia. Though some European NATO members now express interest in
helping to counter Beijing, and the alliance itself is working to stake
out a position on China's rise, as the NATO Reflection Group Report
underscored in November 2020, **[the United States will inevitably be
more invested in Asian developments than will other NATO
members]{.underline}**.16 **[The net result presents]{.underline}** two
possible avenues for deeper, **[substantive divides in the
alliance]{.underline}**. First, if competition with Beijing escalates,
**[the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
**[may be impelled to devote fewer resources and attention to European
affairs]{.underline}**. **[This would invert the Cold War
experience]{.underline}**, **[creating the potential for the alliance to
wither away as American attention moves elsewhere]{.underline}** **[and
NATO's European members]{.underline}** **[seek alternatives for their
security]{.underline}**. Alliances, after all, usually change as new
threats appear; **[as American priorities change]{.underline}**, **[NATO
cohesion may decline]{.underline}** as well. Then, too, European actors
might also be expected to complain about prospective American
"abandonment." Mounting Chinese--American competition may also encourage
NATO's European members to distance themselves, perhaps dramatically,
from the United States. During the contest with the Soviet Union,
European allies regularly feared that Soviet--American tensions might
entangle them in a conflict with Moscow at times and places beyond their
control. A U.S.--China contest would carry even greater risks. With less
at stake in Asia, NATO's European members can be expected to separate
themselves from U.S. policy. If the United States were to respond by
pressuring its European allies to assist against Beijing, an alliance
rupture would become possible. President Biden's path forward
Recognizing these limits, what are the options for the United States
under the Biden administration? Any policy must start from a recognition
that **[America's postwar mission in Europe has reached a natural
end-state born of overwhelming success]{.underline}**. Great powers no
longer pose threats to dominate the region's security or deny the
independence of most countries therein. China, of course, is making
economic and political inroads in the area, but is also encountering
increasing opposition as it overplays its hand and, in any case, does
not threaten the survival or sovereignty of European states. Russia, on
the other hand, has notable military capabilities that can threaten
neighbors along its immediate perimeter, but it lacks the wherewithal to
imperil countries much beyond that. Moreover, its force structure seems
designed to raise the costs for any U.S.--led NATO operation near
Russia's own borders, just as Europe's member states have the economic
and military capacity to oppose any Russian designs. As a result, **[a
stable European balance of power can exist]{.underline}**. This is a
sea-change from the postwar, or even post--Cold War periods. NATO's
original purpose has been vindicated; the victory is won. Any policy
must start from a recognition that America's postwar mission in Europe
has reached a natural end-state born of overwhelming success. In
addition, **[the United States faces diminishing returns, and several
negative results, from continuing its present approach to
NATO]{.underline}**. The alliance has now been enlarged to the point
where few strategically meaningful European actors exist outside of
NATO's orbit, even as those that exist, such as Ukraine, would
constitute a net loss for U.S. national security by risking a direct
conflict with Moscow. In short, little can be gained from continued
expansion. **[Likewise, as European leaders continue pressing for
greater autonomy from the United States and NATO, the U.S. will generate
increased friction with its allies if it continues to suppress their
initiatives in this direction]{.underline}**. This tension, meanwhile,
comes at a time when Europe itself is of diminishing relative importance
to an American grand strategy increasingly fixed on Asia, as most of the
actors involved recognize. As the U.S.--led alliance continues moving
toward Russia's borders, it may play some role in driving Moscow and
Beijing to cooperate in international affairs. In short, U.S. policy in
Asia complicates U.S. strategy in Europe, and vice-versa. The **[United
States requires a course correction]{.underline}**. **[U.S. policy
toward NATO now injects]{.underline}** a large degree of **[instability
and unsustainability into the region]{.underline}**, which ironically
possesses the preconditions for an unprecedented degree of stability
thanks in part to prior U.S. efforts. In consequence, the
**[Biden]{.underline}** administration **[should]{.underline}** consider
proceeding along four tracks, with the goal of significantly reducing
the U.S. security presence via NATO. Ending enlargement In coordination
with its partners, the United States should credibly renounce further
NATO enlargement. Whatever one makes of the merits of America's
post--1945 presence in Europe, the gains from further enlargement are
few and the risks substantial. Several pathways exist to develop a
policy of ceasing enlargement. Most directly, the U.S. government could
simply declare it will not support the alliance's further growth; thanks
to NATO's "one state, one vote" procedures, this would be enough to
scuttle a further expansion push. Less unilaterally, U.S. planners could
attempt to craft an intra--NATO consensus that expansion is no longer
worth the costs. Given that many alliance members have long been
skeptical of the merits of expansion --- German policymakers, for
example, were famously ambivalent over the Bucharest Declaration of
2008, which embraced Ukraine's and Georgia's interest in NATO membership
--- forging a broad front on this agenda ought not be difficult. Along
the way, U.S. and allied diplomats should also seek to dampen the
membership aspirations of those states still outside the alliance.
Cutting troop commitments Second, the U.S. government should forgo
permanently stationing combat forces in the Eastern European states
admitted to NATO since the Cold War. Amid mounting calls to bolster the
alliance's presence along the so-called "eastern flank" due to
collapsing relations with Moscow, the U.S. government should
**[encourage European NATO members to bear primary responsibility for
defense obligations east of the Oder--Neisse line]{.underline}**. Not
only have NATO's European members taken an active role in the alliance's
ongoing "Enhanced Forward Presence" in Poland and the Baltic States;
there is more than enough latent military capability in the European
portion of the alliance to see this task through.17 For example, the
former members of the Warsaw Pact (excluding Albania and the Baltic
States) that have joined NATO since 1995 have nearly the same gross
domestic product (\$1.55 trillion, measured in 2010 dollars) as Russia
(\$1.76 trillion). Their population, 92 million people versus Russia's
144 million, is also significant. Add in the other European members of
NATO, and the numbers shift decisively against Russia. Although
non--U.S. military investments in NATO remain underwhelming, **[even
limited growth]{.underline}** **[in non--U.S. NATO defense capabilities
could]{.underline}** thus **[provide a significant force able to take
the lead in Eastern Europe]{.underline}**. **[The United States should
promote this result, with the goal of shifting the defense burden in
Europe to the highly capable states in the area to reduce U.S. defense
obligations.]{.underline}** Rebalancing trans--Atlantic politics **[The
United States ought to prepare for a broader recalibration of political
responsibilities in Europe]{.underline}**. Precisely because the United
States has other domestic and international obligations, and because
NATO's European members are increasingly disenchanted with U.S.
predominance, **[conditions are ripe to empower the European
allies]{.underline}**. The objective should be **[to strengthen
intra--European solidarity and cooperation while the United
States]{.underline}** **[steps back from active management of European
security]{.underline}**. The United States should pivot toward becoming
the pacifier of last resort rather than the manager of early squabbles.
