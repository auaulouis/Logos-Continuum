#### This debate begins deep within the archives of this resolution. This debate begins in 1949, at the founding of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. This debate begins with the unseen underside of enlightened modernity, with the strands of gratuitous violence we trace across time, with the perpetual accumulation of fungible African life and lives, with the invisible relations of colonial sociopolitical dominance. This debate begins at the start of 73 fateful years in which, like imperial clockwork, the world ended every day.

#### From its inception, the North Atlantic Treaty belonged to whiteness. Ask yourself which African national leaders were present at the founding of the militaristic organizations you invest in -- the answer is none. The world was built from the ground up by the expropriated labor of the transatlantic slave trade, and as the bricks of imperial sovereignty were laid upon each other by black lives lived under an international regime of neo-slavery, a new world order was born. 

#### The epistemic framework of coloniality undergirds NATO's relationship to Africa -- the promotion of Euro-American governance and thought systems through NATO initiatives inscribes the power relations of colonialism onto the world.

Coloniality as a Framework for Theorising Africa Ndlovu-Gatsheni (2013:
7) defines [coloniality as the "dark side of modernity" that has been
consistently packaged to camouflage the inconsistency and discrepancy
between the rhetoric of modernity and the lived experience
thereof.]{.underline} While [modernity esteems values of democracy,
human rights, progress and development, the implementation of these
values is often violent and disastrous when outside the Western
Hemisphere--- the Euro-North American-centric space and
geograph]{.underline}y. One wonders if this rhetoric of the universal
human rights covers spaces and places outside Europe and North
America---the epitome of the Western world. Coloniality is therefore the
rationale that gives rise and justifies colonialism. [Coloniality is the
software of colonialism; the latter being the physical and violent
conquering of a people/civilisation by another, arising from the
former]{.underline}. Coloniality could also be understood as [the
after-effects of colonialism; it refers to "long-standing patterns of
power that emerged as a result of colonialism"]{.underline}
(Ndlovu-Gatsheni 2015: 487). The concept of coloniality of power is a
particular strand that lies within the broader decolonial theory; it is
informed and attributed to Peruvian national and Professor of Sociology
Anibal Quijano who identified [four levers of coloniality. The first is
"control of the economy". The second is "control of authority". The
third is "control of gender and sexuality". The fourth is "control of
knowledge and subjectivity"]{.underline} (quoted in Ndlovu-Gatsheni
2015: 487). Mignolo (2001: 424) submits that, it is the "colonial
experiences" that "outlived decolonisation" and thereby [continue to
provide a template of thought and action that reproduces colonial-like
forms that is problematic; and these patterns or structures constitute
coloniality of power.]{.underline} The patterns that emerged as a result
of colonialism and continue to fester and consolidate modern empire and
its operations are constitutive of coloniality of power. At the centre
of control is power, hence the concept of coloniality of power. "[As the
centre of global capitalism, Europe not only had control of the world
market, but it was also able to impose its colonial dominance over all
the regions and populations of the planet, incorporating them into its
world-system and its specific model of power"]{.underline} (Mignolo
2001: 424[). It is this concept of coloniality of power that this study
will appropriate in analysing the application of Right to Protect (R2P)
in the NATO invasion of Libya in 2011]{.underline} mindful that this
study seeks to establish and determine whether or not, [the Libyan
invasion was linked to the dynamics of coloniality of
power.]{.underline} According to Quijano (quoted in Grosfoguel 2000:
368), coloniality of power is the classification of people through
"historical process of colonial/racial domination". Coloniality of power
is manifested especially after the independence of former colonised
countries in the form of the continuation of "control of economic,
cultural, and political structures of society" (Quijano 1993 quoted in
Grosfoguel 2000: 368). Grosfoguel adds that [the continuation of "power
relations from colonial to postcolonial times allowed the white elites
to classify populations and to exclude people of colour from categories
of full citizenship in the imagined community called the
'nation'"]{.underline} (2000: 368). Civil liberties, rights and
privileges of citizenship were never truly extended to colonial subjects
such as Blacks, Indians, Mulattoes and Mestizos. The control of the
internal grouping of populations by colonialism is the perpetuation of
colonialism in abstentia. [This is the essence of coloniality of power.
Kissinger (2014: 2-3) echoes what Mignolo (2001) observed that
coloniality of power is represented by the long-standing patterns that
emerged as a result of colonialism; he argues that "what passes for
order in our time was devised in Western Europe nearly four centuries
ago, at a peace conference in the German region of Westphalia, conducted
without the involvement or even the awareness of most other continents
or civilisations]{.underline}", such as Africa. Yet, [the so-called
world wars involved Africans as foot soldiers who were used as proxies
of the global powers. They required of Africa cheap (military) labour
for the industrialised and capitalist world. South Africa, under the
apartheid regime, sent its contingent comprising of more than 600 Black
men who were to perish at sea when their ship, the SS Mendi sunk on
route to participating in World War I on 21 February 1918,]{.underline}
yet South Africa, as part of Africa,1 had nothing to do with World War
I, for example (South African Navy 2014). Europe is unquestionably the
originator and epicentre of the crafting of colonial conditions that
were to be "approximated" globally to what is now understood as the
contemporary world order. In other words, a particular, subjective,
shallow and narrow perspective, and to use Kissinger's words, "an
accident" of Europe's imagination of order "became the hallmarks of a
new system of international order" (Kissinger 2014: 3). This is
essentially where coloniality of power lies, in Europe's accident that
"shaped and prefigured the modern" times of Europe into a universally
pertinent structure (ibid.: 4). It [is this universally/globally
appurtenant structure that determines the global power structural
configuration. It is prefigured and can only be re-configured by the
originator---Europe and its allies, particularly the USA and much of the
Western world.]{.underline} Europe's allies often endorse and never are
opposed to this global power structural configuration that is inherently
asymmetrical in favour of the Euro-North American-centric alliance'
perspective. [Anyone/entity that dare oppose the global power structural
configuration is dealt with violently, including death, as was President
Muammar Gaddaf]{.underline}i. This makes Europe an empire. In other
words, Europe's accident was scattered across the globe in an
intentional and malicious manner that sought to expand Europe's
influence and territory. Contemporary global society is ordered around
the patterns that emerged from British colonialism of America and the
rest of the world. America, hence, became the prototype of a colonial
state. Kissinger (2014: 6) points out that "in time, the US would become
the indispensable defender of the order Europe designed". The USA will
defend the system that Europe designed because it was included in the
prefiguring of the global power structural configuration based on the
imagined superiority of race, and hence races were ordered
hierarchically with the White race occupying the apex of the hierarchy.
The influence that Britain and America have in the contemporary world
order is unparalleled. The Euro-North American-centric orientation is
thus monolithic and imposing. Today's society is dominated by Europe and
North America as the two protagonists of the current world order or the
global power structural configuration. Kissinger further reveals that
"[in the American view of world order, peace and balance would occur
naturally, and ancient enmities would be set aside -- once other nations
were given the same principles say in their own governance that
Americans had in theirs]{.underline}" (Kissinger 2014: 6). But, who are
'they' that give other nations those so-called American principles? What
Kissinger reveals here is that America sees itself as part of the design
team of the global world order. It too, is above the world system as it
is the designer of the current world order. [The Euro-North
Americancentric modernity hence is supra the global power structural
configuration]{.underline} because it prefigured it. It cannot be that
the designer of a thing will be governed by the same rules that govern
the designed thing. In 1648, the doctrine of sovereignty was officially
codified and conferred sovereign rights and autonomy to all states. All
states were to be treated as equal in authority as sovereigns in their
domains and in relation to other sovereigns, regardless of economic
stature or arsenal power. Yet in 1815--1886[, this sovereignty was
denied to Africa.]{.underline} Kissinger intones the double-standards of
Europe in the haphazard and spurious application of the principle of
sovereignty; he argues that "they \[Europeans\] often neglected to apply
concepts of sovereignty to the colonies and colonised peoples"
(Kissinger 2014: 6). Since the current global power structural
configuration was an idea of Europe, it is only the Euro-North
American-centric modernity that can reconfigure the design because this
modernity is outside the design. To evince this assertion, it is argued
that "Europe has set out to depart from the state-system itself designed
and to transcend it through a concept of pooled sovereignty" (Kissinger
2014:7). The European Union (EU) is the case in point; ironically,
[Gaddafi was calling for a United Africa (UA) at the time of his
assassination.]{.underline} Admittedly, the utility value of these
institutions (EU, AU, UN, etc.) lies in that they have potency to
provide an even-handed and impartial framework for the engagement of a
diverse community of states, if handled fairly, justly and with
symmetrical influence of the involved parties (Kissinger 2014: 7). The
current global power structural configuration was an invention of
Europe, and as the architect of this system of world governance, Europe
championed the "balance of power concept" with itself as the author and
adjudicator of that system (Kissinger 2004: 7). This reveals the genesis
of the asymmetrical power configuration in this 'new world order'
system. This means that the rationale of colonialism is coloniality.
Coloniality propelled the Europeans to conquer other civilisations in
order to impose their sense of order on every 'other' civilisation. The
Westphalian Peace Treaty was signed in 1648, indicating the official
codification of the doctrine of state sovereignty. The Berlin West
Africa Conference, known for the slogan 'Scramble for Africa' occurred
in 1885--1887 (Iliffe 1979; Pakenham 1992; Chamberlain 2010). The
Versailles Treaty was signed in 1919 signalling the end of World War I
(Kissinger 2014: 24) demonstrating the European doublestandards and
asymmetrical power relations. This also speaks of the inconsistencies of
European modernity. The double-standards applied by Europe in its
interactions with the rest of the world are conspicuous. Another example
of this is that the same European-centric worldview developed
international law. International law entailed that "if a state would
accept these basic requirements, it could be recognised as an
international citizen able to maintain its own culture, politics,
religion and internal policies, shielded by the international system
from outside intervention" (Kissinger 2014: 27). [Europe as the
self-appointed architect, arbiter and adjudicator of states' behaviours
considered international law "as an expandable body of agreed doctrine
aimed at the cultivation of harmony, with the Westphalian treaties
themselves at its heart"]{.underline} (Kissinger 2014: 27). It can be
deduced, therefore, that international law was designed for Europe and
had only Europe at the centre of its creation and intended application,
which then explains [why international law was not upheld at the Berlin
West Africa Conference, Africa was partitioned to the whims of European
imperial powers without any consequence.]{.underline} This renders
international law whim some as it is selectively applied, revealing the
impunity of international law. International law [speaks of recognition
as the precondition for the acceptance of a state in the fold of the
international community of states. It consequently speaks of being
shielded and protected from external intervention. Recognised by who?
Shielded from who? T]{.underline}his is problematic for the African
polity. [How can an imposed order maintain a culture, politics and
internal processes of African ecologies and localities, when an outside
imposition has already been put? If a state does not accept or conform,
it is not protected from outside intervention. Is this not colo- niality
of power at its highest expression?]{.underline} Europe is the
recogniser of states and therefore the guarantor of political
independence of states; Europe is the power that recognises states,
protects states and policies states into conformity and order. The
European civilisation is the ordering state, from which all order is
derived. Such is the control that Europe has on the current global power
structural configuration. This undoubtedly makes Europe an Empire. A
British Statesman, Lord Palmaston, once quipped that "our interests are
eternal and perpetual, and those interests it is our duty to follow"
(quoted in Kissinger 2014: 29--30). Europe prescribes what order is and
what it is not, if a state conforms to the prescribed order it is
insulated from Europe's wrath, but a deviant state is meted with
violence. The problem with the order of Europe is that it is foible and
it varies and changes depending on whom is in question. The Euro-North
Americancentric modernity is not even apologetic about this matter.
Kissinger evinces the rationale behind this arrogance; he notes, "we
mean to do what may seem to be best, upon each occasion as it arises,
making the interests of our country one's guiding principle" (Kissinger
2014: 30). This, in fact, is not a principle because it is whim some,
always depending on circumstances; should a principle not be mandible
depending on circumstance(s)?

#### We begin at the conclusion of the war that prompted NATO's foundation, with the nations that would soon become part of history's most deadly apparatus of eliminatory imperialistic violence.

#### May 8, 1945.

#### Demonstrators gathered in Setif, Algeria to celebrate the defeat of Nazi Germany and protest French colonial rule. As the cries for an independent Algeria swelled, as the Algerian flags were flown, a French military offensive incited a massacre. Bouzid Saal, a 22 year old native Algerian, refused to lay down his flag of liberation. A French soldier shot him dead in seconds. In 15 days 44 villages were plundered and purged of life. In 15 days the blood of 45000 indigenous African people was shed. 

#### January 21, 2021.

#### The office of President Emmanuel Macron declares that there will be "no repentance or apologies" for atrocities committed in Algeria during 132 years of colonial rule or 8 years of brutal counter-insurgent warfare. He further insinuates that Algeria as a nation was nonexistent prior to 1830, the start of French colonial rule, and that the decolonial history of indigenous movements was a revisionist fabrication. 

#### Colonial imperialism is not an event of the past, it is past present and future united in an unbroken continuum of violence.

#### February 28, 1948.

#### African veterans of the second world war gathered in Ghana to peaceful protest mistreatment at the hands of the British government, boycotting their imported goods and demanding benefits for their service. As demonstrators marched towards the capital, the British military opened fire. By March 1^st^, a state of emergency was declared and the Riot Act was instituted to subdue the people's protest. By March 12^th^ the leading members of the resistance were incarcerated in remote parts of Northern Ghana. 

#### One year later British leaders sat at the negotiating table when the Washington Treaty was signed. 

#### February 17, 2011.

#### NATO took it upon themselves to build the perfect storm, a confluence of conditions so severe it would not only rationalize but necessitate the existence and engagement of their global war machine.

#### After the prospect of nationalization of the oil industry was raised, after Libya's new government stood with anti-imperial movements for African sovereignty, after NATO constructed the conditions for counter-revolutionary violence from both sides, funding militaristic fascist groups as well as engaging in facetious diplomatic cooperation with Muhammar al-Gaddafi, ground operations in Libya began.

#### March 19, 2011.

#### A seven month campaign of blanket bombing began in which civilians, rebels, and military forces alike were murdered indiscriminately. 

#### "We are doing it to protect the civilian population from the murderous madness of a regime that in killing its own people has lost all legitimacy." -- Nicolas Sarkozy

#### "(Intervention) is to protect civilians and it is to provide access for humanitarian assistance." -- Hilary Clinton

#### In the wake of NATO and the West lay over 100,000 bodies killed by over 7,700 precision guided bombs, over 2 million people displaced from their homes, and a nation enveloped in chaos where every year, thousands die.

#### Those who scripted this resolution would rather you forget. After all, colonial violence occurs on the margins, in a zone of space-time apart from modernity, it falls outside of history.

Coloniality of Power and the Global Power Structural Configuration:
Unmasking the Politics and Philosophy of Empire Epistemologically, this
chapter seeks to [unmask the fault lines of the philosophy of the
European-centric empire as implicated in the generation of problems
epitomised by the invasion of Libya in 2011 by NATO forces]{.underline}.
It seeks to do so, by exposing some myths that informed, fueled and
continue to precipitate global coloniality in the absence of physical
colonialism. [Current international relations (IR) theories have proven
to be limited and unable to solve and eradicate this epistemic
challenge, partly because dominant and traditional IR theories are
located in the very European modernity that they disguise and camouflage
in the purported objectivity of science. The philosophy of the
Eurocentric empire universalised these particular theories of IR by
force (violence of colonialism) as they are part of the modernity
project of colonisation]{.underline} (Howe 1990: 677). The chapter
further aims to demonstrate [the deficiency and bankruptcy that
foregrounds traditional IR theories' assumptions, assertions and
proclamations particularly that Western-centric IR theories are
scientific, objective and universally applicable or
replicable]{.underline}. Such proclamations overlook the fact that
[these IR theories are located in particular ecologies of Europe and
therefore, are subjective]{.underline}. All knowledge is particular and
subjective to its ecology or locality. Since 1919, the official initial
academic inquiry of IR as a discipline, [IR theories have not adequately
addressed what the discipline initially set out to do---to curb and
liquidate international conflict.]{.underline} This suggests that [the
epistemologies (particular epistemic ecologies and localities) that have
informed IR theories to date are inadequate]{.underline} and have
reached some sort of cul-de-sac, or a dead-end. These epistemologies beg
the question and engage in circular reasoning. [This necessitates an
alternative frame of reference]{.underline}. Contingent upon Albert
Einstein's idea that insanity is doing the same thing over and over
again and expecting a different result each time, this chapter opts to
engage a non-conventional theory in the discipline of IR. As such, [this
work advances the decolonial perspective as a possible solution to
problems caused by epistemologies located in the ecologies and
localities of Western, Euro-North American-centric modernity that
purport themselves as objective, scientific and universal.]{.underline}
The chapter will unmask the inadequacies of Euro-North American-centric
modernity in the face of mounting and current global problems,
particularly those played out in the field of international relations.
IR as an academic discipline started in 1919 at Aberystwyth, University
of Wales (now Aberystwyth University), a year after the end of World War
I (Ziegler 1987). This, however, as Nyere (2014: 18) argues, "does not
mean that intellectual origins of political realism and liberalism only
started in 1919". [The main objective and aim of IR theorising was
solely to find peaceful solutions to international disputes and
therefore avert a similar conflict to World War I. IR failed in that
regard because just barely after a decade, World War II
started]{.underline}. Like the predecessor of the United Nations, the
League of Nations, IR as an academic discipline has failed in achieving
what it set out to do in the first place. [Since 1945, the end of World
War II and the signing of the United Nations Charter in San Francisco,
USA, there has not been a single decade that the world has not witnessed
an international conflict or war (]{.underline}Bennet 1998: 7[).
Rational theories in the discipline of IR, such as realism, liberalism,
feminism, Marxism and constructivism, are expressive of ideas, concepts
and views located in modernity. The ideas expressed in IR rational
theories are embodied by scholars that are mainly located in modernity,
particularly from the Global North and reflect the rationale of European
modernity. The major problem of modernity is the inexplicable
discrepancy and inconsistency between its rhetoric and its lived
reality, its illusion vis-à-vis its essence, particularly from the
experience of people of the Global South]{.underline} in general, but
[by Africans in particular]{.underline}. As such, this chapter intends
to unmask [the inadequacy of mainstream theories and lenses in
explaining the ghosts and blindspots of empire because these ghosts and
blind-spots are born within the empire.]{.underline} The
European-centric empire is not sufficiently able to be reflexive on its
theories and to see beyond its assumptions and assertions. As such, this
chapter suggests [the need to explore outside the lenses of established
theory.]{.underline}

#### Transnational military governance is not a material construct but rather a historical sociology of hegemonic security management that takes shape on the level of representational politics -- the resolution is indebted to a methodology of Euro-American liberal rationalism that is inextricably intertwined with African neocolonialism.

Transnational (in)security governance through the lens of
postcoloniality We claim that [the point of departure for any research
endeavour sensitive to the postcolonial condition of contemporary forms
of transnational (in)security governance consists in]{.underline} what
authors in other fields have called 'provincializing' (Chakrabarty,
2000) or '[decolonizing']{.underline} (Rodríguez et al., 2010) security
studies. This means [avoiding practices of analytical othering by
emphasizing the analytical 'limits of the European experience'
(]{.underline}Wong, 1997). Seth (2009) contrasts two strategies in this
regard: One consists in [providing a different account of history
through the lens of historical sociology]{.underline}. The other,
informed by postcolonial theory, implies [showing the limitations and
non-universality of European analytical categories.]{.underline} While
the latter tradition thus sensitizes us to the fact that 'the central
categories of the social sciences are the product of a European history
and are not necessarily adequate everywhere, even in their amended
versions' (Seth, 2009: 336), historical sociology, according to Seth,
can provide original accounts of subaltern or non-European history.
Seth, however, is more in favour of the postcolonial approach and argues
that non-Eurocentric historical sociology is mainly about 'producing
"better" knowledge on the grounds that it more accurately re-presents
what really happened'. By missing the fact that [knowledge is not only
about re-presenting the world but also about creating it]{.underline},
historical sociology, according to Seth (2009: 336), tends to produce an
external relationship between knowledge and object, a situation that, in
contrast to postcolonial studies, the discipline seems incapable of
overcoming. In contrast to such a rather rigid juxtaposition, we think
[that taking historical sociology seriously is indispensable for a
postcolonial security studies research programme]{.underline}, but that
[in order to unfold its anti-Western-centric potential, historical
sociology, national as well as international, must engage more deeply
with postcolonial studies.]{.underline} As Boatcă and Costa (2010: 14)
have argued in their call for [a 'decolonized' sociology, it is through
such an approximation between sociology and postcolonial studies that
the epistemological limits of sociology that are the result of a
particular academic and epistemological institutionalization of the
discipline, and 'that so far have prevented the emergence of a global
sociology of colonial, neocolonial and postcolonial
contexts',]{.underline} can be overcome. [It is such a 'decolonized'
historical sociology through which 'historical contextualization as a
postcolonial method']{.underline} (Boatcă and Costa, 2010: 17) [can be
productively integrated]{.underline} into a postcolonial security
studies research programme,2 [by highlighting subaltern knowledge and
entangled histories of non-Western societies. Decolonized historical
sociology can also call our attention to phenomena that, while
frequently considered to be occurring only beyond the West, characterize
Western societies themselves, including, for example, areas hardly
reached by the state]{.underline} and where the state's monopoly of
force is absent or strongly compromised (e.g. marginalized urban spaces,
such as the banlieues in France, ETA strongholds in Basque country, and
urban and rural spaces controlled by the mafia in Italy or with forms of
vigilante justice in the United States). [Taking such insights seriously
illustrates the limitations of analytical categories bound to the idea
of a Western-centric methodological nationalism for understanding
(in)security governance even in our contemporary world more
generally.]{.underline} Consequently, our critique of Western-centric
analytical categories does not imply a call for abandoning all Western
theory. Without denying that much, if not most, European theory is
marked by the above-mentioned problems stemming from Occidentalism and
Western-centrism, instead of simply abandoning these theories, we share
Bhabha's (1994: 18--28) 'commitment to theory'. While challenging the
'fictitious universalism' (Bourdieu, 2000: 65) of Western theories, such
a commitment, in our understanding, enhances their analytical scope
through what Jackson, following Hall, called 'theoretical
transculturation'. This implies 'demonstrating that such \[Western\]
theory does not in fact describe or map the entire planet, and that
despite pretensions to universalism it suffers from gaps and lacunae,
and for this reason needs to be revised in the light of local empirical
conditions' (Jackson, 2003: 73). But the argument for provincializing
security studies can even be pushed further. [Writing from an African
perspective, Mbembe and Nutall (2004: 348) argue that our task is not
simply to demonstrate the fallacies of knowledge derived from a
particular European experience, but rather to engage in a 'worlding' of
the African experience. Africa is fraught as an idea and object of
academic research, as it has become a sign in public debates for the
'other', the 'failed', the 'incomplete' and something apart from the
world]{.underline}, probably more so than Latin America and Asia.
[Constructed as 'out of the world' by policymakers and academics, a
postcolonial security studies perspective would require 'reinscribing'
African (in)security knowledge, experiences and practices into the world
and thereby depicting these as 'normal' and relevant parts of the human
experience, not an exotic exception.]{.underline} This would imply
[recognizing the African experience of 'indeterminancy',
'provisionality', 'contingency' and uncertainty as a basic condition of
life, and as a reality that requires analytical lenses and gives rise to
relevant research questions in its own right (]{.underline}Mbembe and
Nutall, 2004: 349). Recent scholarship in urban studies has not only
stressed the 'ordinary' character of (postcolonial) urban experiences
across the world (Robinson, 2006) but also suggests that postcolonial
cities like Shanghai, Dubai or Lusaka, rather than Western cities, might
be the avant-garde of global metropolitan developments (Myers, 2011; Roy
and Ong, 2011) -- including the governance of (in)security. Postcolonies
might in fact offer 'privileged insight into the workings of the world
at large' (Comaroff and Comaroff, 2012: 1[). This calls for an
engagement with site specific modernities and ways of constructing
security governance in 'ex-centric sites']{.underline} (Bhabha, 1994: 6)
in [the peripheries of world society in which the Western narrative of
modernity is but one among others informing people's ways of imagining
and constructing the world. Taking such a perspective seriously produces
new understandings of the dynamics of peacekeeping, state-building and
anti-terror interventions -- which security studies often deals with as
though an innocent division could be drawn between interveners and
intervened, a liberal 'us' and another 'them', or as though these
interventions are the only privileged sites for the globalization of
security knowledge and technologies in our contemporary
world.]{.underline} However, [security interventions also take place in
indirect ways. Dominant (in)security discourses constitute situations
and particular actors as transnational security risk]{.underline}, with
important repercussions for individual security. A case in point is the
'discovery' of diaspora communities as partners in conflict prevention
in 'developing countries', highlighted in Laffey and Sutharan's article
in this issue with reference to the international engagement with the
Tamil diaspora. Considering the above-mentioned entangled histories of
(in)security governance, [the analytics of postcoloniality also remind
us that security practices are globalized through borrowing and
emulation by local elites -- be that through forced geopolitical
pressures or as a result of instrumental calculation -- as well as
through indirect effects of hegemonic discourses and
practices]{.underline} in transnational fields (Bilgin, 2010: 618; 2009:
340). Jacobsen's article in this issue on the introduction of the Unique
Identity Number biometrical identification system for Indian citizens,
which is inseparable from globally dominant discourses on technology,
knowledge and development, is illustrative in this regard.
[Postcoloniality pervades security knowledge and practices in all these
spaces in which security governance is strongly shaped by external
actors and/or transnational discourses and practice fields.]{.underline}
However, few studies have looked into the de facto effects of these
transnational influences on local (in)security governance and on the
agency of those people involved and affected -- both in and beyond the
postcolony. Where such agency has been taken seriously, such efforts
have mostly focused on the hybrid nature of the outcomes of external
security interventions at the local level (e.g. Mac Ginty, 2010). By
localizing the scope and effects of local agency to the local arena,
such a perspective, however, downplays [how 'local' agency and security
practices may transform the transnational security field
itself]{.underline}. While security studies has thus dealt with the
transnational entanglements of (in)security governance in postcolonies
and the 'local' repercussions of transnational security governance, much
of the literature buys into the research objects, binary categories and
unidirectional travelling of knowledge and institutions established in
Eurocentric narratives of security governance. In the remainder of this
article, we will therefore highlight three methodological moves that in
our view provide the basis for overcoming these deficits and rendering
security studies research more sensitive to the postcolonial condition.

#### Emerging technologies and the security governance they necessitate take shape through the universalizing drive of epistemic colonialism -- the resolution is a flawed security study that imposes a linear framework of political solvency onto a chaotic world of unresolved legacies and lost futures. The ballot is a referendum on the scholarly discipline of debate -- challenging the power relations of debate as an academic practice should be your ethical priority.

Is it possible to [create a field of security studies that is
"decolonized,]{.underline}" so to speak, and [attuned to the multiple
forms of power relations that affect everyday security
practices---beyond those embedded in powerful states]{.underline}? In
this essay, I have suggested that it [is worth exploring "decolonial"
perspectives as an alternative means of shedding light on dynamics of
inclusion and exclusion in global security.]{.underline} Decolonial
approaches focus on [transforming structures, rather than simply
diversifying them, and provide an alternative to more "problem-solving"
approaches to inclusion and exclusion]{.underline}. The literature on
decolonial theory and its application is vast, and this brief commentary
has only touched on some representative arguments in a somewhat
superficial manner. Nevertheless, it is worth asking to what extent
incorporating principles of decoloniality could open up broader
discussions on "inclusion" and "exclusion" in ways that might [help
transform the field.]{.underline} Security studies, perhaps more than
any other field, has had a close link with the policy interests (and
worldviews) of the most powerful. [Decolonial approaches provide a means
of shedding further light on this, by examining how and why the field
legitimizes some voices while silencing others. A decolonial lens
provides the means of excavating the history of such exclusions, by
pointing to their connection with unresolved colonial, racial, and
imperial histories.]{.underline} A number of decolonial scholars have
provided practical guidance on how to promote more inclusive
conversations in IR and security studies in ways that would [expand who
"speaks" in the discipline (]{.underline}see, e.g., Sabaratnam 2011).
Yet, decolonial approaches have also been criticized for the way they
can also reproduce the very colonial categories and hierarchies that
they challenge, rather than move beyond them (Murray 2019). This has led
some to connect decolonial approaches with the need to move to a more
planetary form of politics and collective solidarity, in which the
underlying logic is one of entanglement, interdependence, and dialogue,
rather than binary forms of inclusion and exclusion (Stengers 2010;
Burke et al. 2016; Conway 2019). Such strategies may be in[creasingly
necessary under rapidly changing conditions of technological
change]{.underline} and planetary environmental destruction. For
example, [the rise of big data and the increased role that algorithms
play in shaping the lifeworlds of individuals lead to a type of
universal "colonization" of life by technology in ways that decolonial
approaches can help to shed light on.3]{.underline} Similarly, [the
notion of the Anthropocene can be seen as being characterized by the
colonization of nature by humans, in ways that actively exclude and
threaten the security of many of the nonhuman inhabitants of the
planet]{.underline}. Clearly, there is still a long way to go in the
task of theorizing dynamics of inclusion and exclusion in global
security studies. This special issue, however, has made an [important
step forward in raising the question]{.underline}, and in bringing to
the fore cases that address issues of gender, religion, national
identity, and refugees. The question the special issue ultimately leaves
us with is: What other forms of exclusion may we still be blind to, and
how can we begin the process of excavating and addressing them?

#### The methodology of normative debate is a chronopolitical process of linearization that erases colonized historical entanglements and traps indigenous subjects in an affective time warp -- a dissection of the resolution is necessary.

While the research on reader response has accounted for the ways that
[[colonial histories shape the present]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[there has
been]{.mark}, to date, [little exploration of the ways]{.mark} that
[reading practices]{.mark} can, at times, [keep us stuck in an affective
time warp]{.mark} -- that is, how the [past]{.mark} continually [merges
with the present and future in]{.mark} [potentially threatening
ways]{.mark}.]{.underline} We are especially interested in how
**[transmedial]{.underline}** **[storytelling might function as a
relational and [ethical process of disruption]{.mark} in order [to make
visible]{.mark} [that which "cannot be easily seen in]{.mark} the
[conventional]{.mark} [methodological]{.mark}
[sense]{.mark}"]{.underline}** (Blackman, 2019, p. 18). As such, [we
explore literacies/reader responses as a queer form of storytelling and
time-travel: "not queer as in strange, but queer as undoing, queer as
'trans/ formation'" (p. 247). Using the postqualitative approach of
thinking with theory (Jackson and Mazzei, 2012), we think with theories
of affect -- specifically, cruel optimism (Berlant, 2011) alongside
transmediality (Blackman, 2019, p. 23) -- as methodological and
analytical tools.]{.underline} [Thinking with theory is an embodied
engagement that calls on researchers to read data through particular
theoretical lenses.]{.underline} While difficult to capture with words
(Jackson and Mazzei, 2012), [this process involves "poring over the
data, annotating, describing, linking, bringing theory to bear,
recalling what others have written and seeing things from different
angles]{.underline}" (MacLure, 2013, p. 174). [[Rather than
treating]{.mark} [data]{.mark} here [as]{.mark} a still [object]{.mark}
[to]{.mark} [code, dissect]{.mark} and [examine]{.mark} for conclusive
patterns, **[we see it as agential matter]{.mark} [that calls forth
new]{.mark} and different [possibilities]{.mark}. In other words, the
ongoing and [open-endedness of thinking with]{.mark} data/theory open us
up to multiple ways of engaging with literacy learning and instruction,
as well as [different times and spaces]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Less
concerned, then, with representational fidelity (Dernikos, 2018;
Niccolini, 2016), we position [transmedial]{.underline} [storytelling as
a radical politics that invites us to [consider moments within
educational spaces as affective "scenes of entanglement]{.mark}":
"disjointed, emotional, bent and [other wordly]{.mark}"
(]{.underline}Blackman, 2019, p. 57) scenes that serve [to
[highlight]{.mark} the "[normalised" fantasies]{.mark} we have created
in terms of who counts as literate and what counts as proper aesthetic
responses to text which, in turn, become enmeshed with what counts as
proper personhood.]{.underline} According to Blackman (2019), [[science
is a "storytelling machine" with the propensity to "sanitise, excise or
even exorcise narratives, actors, agents and
entitie]{.mark}s]{.underline}" (p. 41). This [machine furthers a
[dominant narrative that not only decontextualises time and space, but
also affectively circulates to re/produce student bodies in myriad
ways]{.mark}, for example, as "struggling," "unsuccessful" and even
learning "disabled]{.underline}" (see e.g. Dernikos, 2018;
Souto-Manning, Dernikos, and Yu, 2016). As a larger destructive force,
[it has the potential to [violently impact our capacity to read, write,
think, imagine and respond]{.mark} otherwise, thereby [closing off other
ways of knowing, being and doing]{.mark}.]{.underline} Yet, as Blackman
argues**[, there is always more than one story being told at a time, as
[any narrative is "multiplatform]{.mark}]{.underline}**" (p. 19[): **[It
does not exist in one place]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[, is [distributed
across time and space and]{.mark} is enacted by multiple agents, actors,
agencies, entities and objects ... the history of storytelling is one
that is transmedial ...]{.underline}** .**[transmedial storytelling is a
form of storytelling that [sets in motion fugitive and fossilised times
and]{.mark} that [allows new visibilities to be
shaped]{.mark}]{.underline}** ...(pp. 22, 51) Through transmedial
storytelling, we **[[seek to unearth the dominant stories]{.mark} that
are [often held as truths]{.mark} so as [to create moments of
possibilities]{.mark}, or different narratives, [that]{.mark}
"[enliven]{.mark} rather than report, to render rather than represent,
to resonate rather than validate, to [rupture]{.mark} and
[reimagine]{.mark} rather than to faithfully describe"]{.underline}**
(Vannini, 2015, p. 15). In this way, [we think with data/theories of
affect as "scenes of entanglement" (]{.underline}Blackman, 2019, p. 23)
so as to [reimagine standardised understandings and taken for granted
notions of what it means to be successfully literate]{.underline}. The
data that we explore here derived from a larger 6-month post/
qualitative study examining the affective encounters that impacted the
making of first grade students as "un/successful" readers (see Dernikos,
2015, 2018). As we share these scenes of entanglement, we offer a
glimpse of two young people who are considered "good" readers and
explore the affective potentialities that social, political and economic
forces unknowingly impose on their reading lives.

#### In this debate, past, present, and future are one -- a continuum of violence calls for a continuum of resistance.

#### Thus we affirm a process of rememory----an anti-colonial analysis of time that disrupts the linearity and universality of Western thought and calls upon the silent yet enduring realities of colonization.

III\. Rememory and Willed Forgetfulness: [Resisting White Supremacy's
Vision of Life and Death 16 In Beloved, Toni Morrison (1987) presents
'rememory' as structural remembrance transcending individual or
time-segregated acts of remembrance]{.underline}. Reflecting on her
experiences of enslavement Sethe explains: It's so hard for me to
believe in it \[time\]. Some things go. Pass on. Some things just stay.
I used to think it was my rememory...But it's not... places are still
there. If a house burns down, it's gone, but the place the picture of it
-- stays, and not just in my rememory, but out there, in the world
(ibid., 35-36, emphasis added). [**In rewriting our conceptions of
memory into rememory Morrison invokes the intergenerational nature of
structural violence**, speaking to institutional and intergenerational
memory held within the bodies of enslaved Africans, European
slaveholders, settler-colonists and their descendants.]{.underline} When
Orlando Patterson (1982, 175) declared racial thinking constructs race
upon the assumption of innate differences based on real or imagined
physical or other differences he inspired us to consider how
constructions of difference between races produces a likeness
necessitating homogeneity within racial categories, giving rise to the
stereotyping of Blackness imagined by White culture. [That homogeneity
of the stereotype is a repeating and ghosted process whereby White
rememory articulates across time the violent constructions of Blackness
implanted by their slaveholding and colonizing ancestors.¶]{.underline}
Flipping the oppressive nature of this process Stuart Hall's (1996, 211)
construction of Black cultural identity asserts our cultural identities
reflect the common historical experiences and shared cultural codes
which provide us, as 'one people' with stable, unchanging and continuous
frames of reference and meaning beneath the shifting divisions of
vicissitudes of our actual history... This 'oneness', underlying all the
other, more superficial differences, is the truth, the essence, of
'Caribbeaness'. What he terms 'Caribbeaness' can be applied to a larger
Diasporic Blackness born out of a place of surviving displacement
alongside and because of Diasporic Whiteness born out of a place of
imagined entitlement and militarized hetero-patriarchal racism. [At the
root is a system of terror trapping colonized and enslaved peoples
within cycles of abusive relationships structured upon
racism]{.underline} -- a masculinized, heteronormative, classist system
of control of the global majority so that a minority White community can
achieve abusive, parasitic prosperity. [What involuntarily binds us
together are the institutionalized, thus wide-reaching and repetitive
praxis of colonial violence.]{.underline} [**Through both the processes
of colonizing or being colonized we emerge** -- with very different
relationships to history and systems -- **a people haunted by racial
colonialism** and promises broken, **submerged in** what Black Feminist
termed **willed forgetfulness,** a process whereby the colossal
injustice in the settlement of the West has been successfully repressed
by settler culture.]{.underline} Willed forgetfulness has been
foundational to my conceptions of [**Black Feminist Hauntology** as it
**opens a window to envision and articulate the overbearing silence** --
**reimagined as enforced or willed forgetfulness surrounding colonial
violence and its racializing ways.**]{.underline} Willed forgetfulness
is rooted within dominant colonizing cultures and thus impacts all that
live within them: ...and suddenly there was Sweet Home \[plantation\]
rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling out before her in shameless beauty.
It never looked as terrible as it was and it made her wonder if hell was
a pretty place too. Fire and brimstone all right, but hidden in lacy
groves. Boys hanging from the most beautiful sycamores in the world. It
shamed her -- remembering the wonderful soughing trees rather than the
boys. Try as she might to make it otherwise, the sycamores beat out the
children every time and she could not forgive her memory for that
(Morrison, 1987, 6). ¶ [The impact of willed forgetfulness manifests
itself through Sethe's memory in manners that move her beyond will and
into a coerced place of conquest. These conceptions of memory, renamed
rememory take on new dimensions beyond the mind, now residing in
repeated (institutionalizing) actions 'out there' beyond each
individual.]{.underline} Rememory is preserved in institutions, branded
upon their violently structured bureaucracies and practiced upon the
bodies of the colonized by the bodies of colonizers: [**a specter is
haunting modernity -- the specter of colonialism**. It is from outside
our own decisionmaking reaches, a dichotomized notion of remembrance
versus forgetfulness, that rememory's haunted manners formed my
imaginings of Black Feminist Hauntology]{.underline} IV. What is a
Sociological Ghost? Is She a Black Feminist? 20 [**Black Feminist
Hauntology is an anti-colonial analysis of time that captures the
expanding and repetitive nature of structural violence**, a process
**whereby we begin to locate a language to speak about the actual, not
just symbolic or theorized violence that is racial colonialism.** The
ghosted nature of this work brings forth or calls upon the silent yet
visible and enduring realities of colonialism]{.underline}:¶ ...a
'sociological ghost,' the form by which something is lost, barely
visible, or seemingly not there to our supposedly well-trained eyes,
makes itself known or apparent to us, in its own way, of course. The way
of the ghost is haunting, and haunting is a very particular way of
knowing what has happened or is happening. [**Being haunted draws us
affectively**, sometimes against our will and always a bit magically,
**into the structure of feeling of a reality we come to experience,**
not as cold knowledge, but as a transformative recognition... **the
forces in our lives that we usually try to ignore or forget, but never
totally leave us alone**]{.underline}. If we deliberately investigate
these ghosts, though, we can learn to take control over troubling
memories; we may turn destructive haunting into something more enabling
(Jacobs, 2007, 7). [Here, the term 'ghost' neither confirms nor denies
the metaphysical. It simply invokes a framework in which terror and
unpredictability, grief and unrest, guilt and injustice, ancestors and
demons can be called upon to empower and liberate us, not from the fact
that we have been violated or even that violation continues, but from a
condition of inability to locate the heart and soul of the
problem.]{.underline}

#### Reject the techno-liberal dream of the resolution \-- we shift our gaze to the past, take refuge in forgotten narratives, venture into the affective terrain of the unknown and the unseen, in order to create decolonial futures.

Since [most of us have been conditioned to think of literacy as "power,"
a "state of grace", or a necessary skill needed to function in the
modern world]{.underline} (Scribner, 1984, p.8), it might seem odd to
think about [literacy as a problematic object of attachment]{.underline}
-- as cruelly optimistic. Yet here we are. It is clear in the case of
both Carl and Beth that being a "good" reader comes with fraught
decisions and the ability to navigate relations of attachment that are
either "impossible, sheer fantasy, or too possible, and toxic" (Berlant,
2011, p. 24). Take reading standards. They are supposed to be helpful,
fill in gaps and open a world of possibilities, but for both Carl and
Beth --both considered "good" readers-- these standards produced
something else, something cruel. According to Ahmed (2011), forces mold
and shape us, where any given moment can be impressive and/ or
oppressive. But interestingly enough, this pressing -- in whatever form
it takes -- is often meant as good will. Perhaps this is what is most
cruel (Berlant, 2006) about mainstream literacy policies/practices and
national efforts to standardise literacy education -- they are actually
meant to help students, like Carl and Beth, achieve [the [dream of a
"good]{.mark}" or "better [life]{.mark}"]{.underline} (Jones and Vagle,
2013). However, this promise [[will never be achieved if we
ignore]{.mark} the precarities of the past:]{.underline} **[The
[aftermath of colonialism and]{.mark} the [ways]{.mark} our
[reading]{.mark} [practices]{.mark} [are shaped in relation to other
times, spaces, people and places]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Sharpe, 2016).
[As literacy educators and researchers committed to other ways of
knowing/being/doing]{.underline}, **[transmedial storytelling helps us
to [mediate]{.mark} "[possible (lost) futures in the
present]{.mark}"]{.underline}** (Blackman, 2019, p. 53). **[Mediating
[disrupts]{.mark} the [rigid normativity of dominant stories that keep
us affectively stuck in time(s]{.mark}).]{.underline}** That said, our
intent here is not to forward a prescriptive approach to literacy, as we
imagine engaging in [[t]{.mark}ransmedial storytelling [involves
zigzagging unknowable pedagogical terrain,]{.mark} thereby [opening
up]{.mark} multiple [possibilities for practice]{.mark} and for bodies
read as un/successful.]{.underline} We would, nevertheless, like to
offer the following questions as provocations for educators to consider
so that things might be otherwise (see also Dernikos, 2018; Thiel and
Kuby, 2019): • In [[what ways do affective forces]{.mark} (social,
political, economic, racial, gendered, etc.) [shape]{.mark} and
re/orient [pedagogical acts]{.mark}?]{.underline} • **[[What hidden
histories are lodged in the present]{.mark} to make certain identities
im/possible for students]{.underline}**, both as literacy learners and
human beings?3 • [What do certain literacy pedagogies produce? Who do
they serve]{.underline} -- at what cost and to whom? • **[How can
transmedial storytelling [guide curricular
choices]{.mark}]{.underline}** --e.g. by inviting educators to expand
their idea of the classics (see also Dernikos, 2018; McNair, 2010) so as
to embrace literature written by and about people from varied racial and
ethnic backgrounds?4 • **[[How]{.mark} else [might literacy and teaching
be practiced]{.mark} if we remember literacy [as affective
time-traveling?]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[Questions]{.mark} like these
pro[vide small openings for displaced, devalued]{.mark} and/[or]{.mark}
simply [forgotten narratives]{.mark} and possibilities [to
unfold]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Attending to affect, then, reminds us
that [matter is not only lively but also historical; this [historicity
makes time-travel possible by]{.mark} [displacing]{.mark} the [binary
logic that strictly separates]{.mark} the [past, present and
future.]{.mark}]{.underline} In other words, **[transmedial storytelling
["sets in motion fugitive and fossilised times ... that allow\[s\] new
visibilities to be shaped]{.mark}]{.underline}**" (p. 51) and offers
different insights into literacy practices. As Beth's scene of
entanglement teaches us, engaging in critical literacy practices by
simply introducing a book with diverse characters is not enough. [We
must also address the larger affective forces (e.g. social, historical,
political and economic) that shape children's interpretative responses
to literature in both expected and unexpected ways.]{.underline}
Ultimately, [attachments to happy objects]{.underline} such as
fairytales often operated to compromise Ms. Rizzo's students, while at
the same time, [[promisi]{.mark}ng [to help]{.mark} them become
successfully [literate bodies]{.mark} who can [have "the good life" if
they]{.mark} just [follow the rules]{.mark}.]{.underline} But for Carl,
Beth and other young people in this first grade classroom, learning to
read was, [in large part, [tied to]{.mark}]{.underline} Core Knowledge
read alouds and the kinds of information that presumably made for a
"culturally literate" somebody: [a [subject]{.mark} [aligned
with]{.mark} a "[White \[middle class\] and heterosexually]{.mark}
[normative narrative]{.mark} of the world"]{.underline} (Muñoz, 2000, p.
75). The problem is, as Carl suggested, that [this narrative of the
world is in direct opposition to the social worlds these young children
lived and breathed]{.underline}. The [hope, then, or promise of a
happier "better life" inevitably begins to crumble as happy objects
cling to other relational forces (e.g., gender, sexuality, race and
heteronormativity) that work to limit capacities to think and feel
differently -- to move throughout the social in cruelly optimistic
ways.]{.underline} We call on educators to recognise that standardised
literacy policies (such as Common Core), practices and
**[[pedagogies]{.mark} often [cruelly privilege colonial
histories]{.mark} and dominant narratives circulating within classroom
spaces -- impacting students in ways we may not even be aware.
Transmedial storytelling offers possibilities to not only notice but
also [unsettle these histories]{.mark} and narratives. And while
[histories cannot be erased, futures are yet to be
written]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

#### Debate is a site of historiography -- the topic is not a statement of objective linearity but rather a myriad of competing and collective histories, a subjective construction of embodied knowledge and experience -- the 1AC shifts the pedagogical paradigm within this debate towards the practice of insurgent subaltern thought that disrupts Western chronopolitical narratives.

The writing of history has long been a privileged calling undertaken

Parenti (2003, p. 13) [History is alive. It is neither static nor fixed.
History is the subjective construction of what and how, people and
groups remember. It is the totality of lived experience. While often
perceived as an immovable sort of record, history is better understood
as a site of struggle. There is strategic importance in the who, why,
where and how of knowledge production. The struggle is that of a
prolonged interrogation of competing versions of events, as well as the
power relations implicit in those versions.]{.underline} This paper is

England's queen, always in view. My people and my society have cultured

quiet one, understood best not through my words or actions -- for I have
long spoken anti-racism -- but through the instincts and reactions that
I have come to interrogate and have attempted to change in the last half

places and pursuits best left alone by the dominant. This is not to say
that Whites have no role in the anti-colonial struggle, but rather that
those roles are often best assigned and designed by the oppressed. It is
relevant here to make a distinction between being White (as a subject
location and site of difference) and Whiteness (as a system of
privilege) (see Ruttenberg, 1993). Such distinctions must not obfuscate
the role all White people play in White supremacy -- be it often or
rare, intentional or unintentional. With this said, White people have a
crucial role to play in contesting White privilege. Production and
reproduction of knowledge are ideally, collective pursuits, which
recognize and work to dissolve power inequities -- pedagogically and
epistemologically. This work is thus not prescriptive, but
interrogative. It aims to support an anti-colonial project,
theoretically and practically, by providing both a framework and
examples for and of, anti-colonial historiography. [The anti-colonial
framework casts a critical gaze wherever imposition occurs. It rejects
the etymological implication of the "post" in post-colonialism and
asserts that the colonial encounter is trans-historical rather than
historical -- it persists in colonized and colonizing
nations.]{.underline} As far as education, [we may look to the myriad
ways that difference is ignored, suppressed or taken up in classrooms
and curricula.]{.underline} It is not only under the tutelage of
invading colonizing regimes that people find themselves excluded from
the format and content of their education. The anti-colonial stance
posits that not only are indigenous people made foreigners in their own
lands by way of the colonial encounter, but also that immigrants and
racialized minorities are similarly excluded from/by dominant
pedagogical practices. The international socio-political processes of
displacement, impoverishment and migration (forced and voluntary) are
thus relevant here. So when analyzing colonialism in the contemporary
context, we must relate the legacy of Spanish colonialism in Mexico, to
the lives of Mexicans fighting for health care in California and Texas.
[When looking at the legacy of French imperialism in Africa, we must
look at the struggle for representation by North Africans in Southern
France. How do the educational practices in these regions (the US and
France, as well as Mexico and Northern Africa) reflect power and
competing histories in these multifaceted colonial
encounters?]{.underline} These are but two examples, not of a new
colonialism, but of [the internationalization and extension of
colonialism.]{.underline} This can be understood as one very important
aspect of globalization/imperialism. In the Canadian context, imposition
is thus understood not simply as it affects the indigenous people who
continue to fight for autonomy under the yolk of Canadian colonialism,
but as it affects all those marginalized by the content and contexts of
schooling[. Anti-colonial education interrogates the
Euro-American/Canadian lens and philosophy through which such practices
are developed and invoked. Those who teach history do not simply convey
knowledge, but go much further and construct it through conscious and
unconscious inclusion and exclusion of historical perspectives,
contributions and even]{.underline}ts. To teach history well is to
question and teach questioning, at every turn. A critical approach to
teaching and learning cannot be taken up merely for the sake of being
critical. Our questioning should be both strategic and compassionate.
[The history instructor should not only address historical events, but
also the history of how events in question have been taught hitherto.
Historical events exist in transhistorical contexts and can have
transhistorical relevance. An awareness of these contexts is crucial to
understanding (a) regional power discrepancies, as Said (1993) argues,
and (b) local power inequities and inequalities current and historical.
History is a responsibility; an imperfect pursuit with specific
interests and intentions in play at every turn.]{.underline} Zinn
writes: My argument cannot be against selection, simplification,
emphasis, which are inevitable for both cartographers and historians. .
. . \[T\]he mapmaker's distortion is a technical necessity for a common
purpose shared by all people who need maps. [The historian's distortion
is more than technical, it is ideological; it is released into a world
of contending interests, where any chosen emphasis supports (whether the
historian means to or not) some kind of interest, whether economic or
political or racial or national or sexual. (1]{.underline}999, p. 8)
[The error we must avoid in the telling and teaching of history is thus
not subjectivity, but the denial thereof. To claim that any perspective
is complete and/or neutral, is erroneous. To claim that history is told
or taught without specific objectives (conscious or unconscious) is
inaccurate. We must then acknowledge the purpose and perspective of our
teaching and telling of history -- we must identify the subjectivities
at play in the narratives we convey, lest we fall prey to the
Eurocentric claim of objectivity and its corresponding mask of
universality.]{.underline} Formal curricula, at all levels of study
(elementary, high school and college/university) serve to construct
meaning for students as far as self-identification, cultural belonging
and school engagement. History, with its philological, cultural,
economic, geographic, political and social strands is perhaps unique
among so-called "disciplines" in that the implications for the learner
are so broad. In the case of popular representations of Aboriginal
Peoples and perspectives in dominant Canadian history, not only are the
people and perspectives largely absent, but so too is the story of the
attempted genocide of the People of Turtle Island and their history. A
reconsideration of such history is thus not only a strategic
examination, but also one that quite simply, seeks greater accuracy and
thoroughness in order to combat the removal of so much from the history
of Turtle Island.1 [Historical analyses and the creation of the "other",
either as backward or as outside of history, are present throughout
colonized and colonizing societies currently and
historically.]{.underline} The dominant has for centuries, written the
dominated out 131 KEMPF of the historical material process. The works of
leading European thinkers (like Bacon, Descartes, Hume, Rousseau, Kant,
Smith, Ricardo and others) from a variety of fields (such as politics,
mathematics, science, philosophy, economics and others) serve as a
modern foundation and prescription for othering non-dominant knowledges
and peoples (see Shiva, 1997; Wolff, 2000; Bishop, 1990; Joseph, 1987;
and others). The effects of such thinkers are present in educational
practises in almost all colonial contexts. [Educational imperialism is a
crucial element of colonialism, with profound effects on the colonized
and colonizer.]{.underline} Fanon writes: . . . \[C\]olonialism is not
content to impose its rule upon the present and the future of a
dominated country[. Colonialism is not satisfied with holding a people
in its grip and emptying the native's brain of all form and content. By
a kind of perverted logic, it turns to the past of the oppressed people,
and distorts, disfigures and destroys it. This work of devaluing
colonial history takes on a dialectical significance today.]{.underline}
(1963, p. 210). Fanon's work speaks to the mental effects of colonialism
and colonial education. The uni-focal history of dominant/colonial
education serves to amputate marginalized people from their past and
consequently from their present. In Canada today, the histories of
Aboriginal people are excluded from dominant education. Spivak's (1996)
work with community groups and scholars on the historiography of the
Subaltern in India, is a relevant example not only of historical
interrogation, but of the creation of a revised popular history. The
subaltern can be loosely understood in the Gramscian sense as comprised
by "non-elite or subordinated social groups" (Landry and MacLean, 1996,
p. 203). The knowledge and practices of these groups are understood for
the purposes of an anti-colonial historiography, as relevant in and of
themselves, as well as informative for positive (action-oriented) social
change. The anti-colonial critique must be pointed at all thinkers and
philosophies, on the left and the right. Two hundred years ago, even
revolutionary European thinkers partook of the oppressive practice of
"othering". In the Introduction to A Critique of Political Economy, Marx
writes: "Tribes living exclusively on hunting or fishing are beyond the
boundary line from which real \[historical\] development begins" (from
Eze, 2000, p. 234). The telling, or omission, of the history of the
colonized by the colonizer, is part of the reproduction and preservation
of what Eze calls the "neocolonial setup" (2000, p. 242). He writes:
They speak of the colonized or of the subjects of neocolonial
exploitation in biological terms and declare them to be the antagonists
of history. The native, or the neocolonial peasantry is said to be
inferior and have no appreciation of values . . . Thus the settler, or
neocolonial elite, has no regrets or qualms of conscience for he does
violence not to humans but to strange entities located between humanity
and undifferentiated history. (2000, p. 242) [When students see neither
themselves nor their histories reflected in their education,
disengagement understandably follow]{.underline}s. In Decolonizing
Methodologies, Smith writes: "[Schooling is directly implicated in this
process. Through the curriculum and its underlying theories of
knowledge, early schools redefined the world and where indigenous people
were positioned within the world"]{.underline} (1991, p. 33). In many
cases, Aboriginal people have been located outside of the world: the
world of progress, the world of goodness, the world of history. In the
capitalist epoch, history decidedly begins and ends with capitalism. For
orthodox Marxists, history begins and ends with class struggle. Cabral
says in a 1966 speech: \[T\]his leads us to pose the following question:
does history begin only with the development of the phenomenon of
'class', and consequently of class struggle? To answer in the
affirmative would be to place outside history the whole period of life
of human groups from the discovery of hunting, and later of nomadic and
sedentary agriculture, to the organization of herds and the private
appropriation of land. It would also be to consider . . . that various
human groups in Africa, Asia and Latin America were living outside of
history. (1969, p. 77) Although Cabral is speaking in the African
context almost forty years ago, his words are true today in many
colonial settings and speak to the global nature of the oppression
implicit in so much colonial pedagogy -- currently and historically. The
education system in Ontario, Canada for example, ignores the content and
practice of Aboriginal history and epistemology. It instead provides
compulsory Canadian settler history that preserves the salience of
settler domination. Inaccurate and oppressive histories are thus thrust
upon Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Peoples alike. Edward Said (1997)
argues that although Marx was sympathetic to non-EuroAmerican peoples
suffering under the yolk of European imperialism, he saw the suffering
as the beginning of the reorientation of a backward society, toward the
possibility of a better future. Marx was concerned with oppressed people
but was guilty of the paternalistic western discursive position that
"they" need civilising, if only on an economic level, by "us". Marx was
content to form his understanding of the non-European Subaltern from
problematic symbols of Orientalism, created and maintained by the
dominant political project; a project which Marx himself purported to
reject (Said, 1997). Said quotes Marx and his racist conclusion about
Asian Peoples, "they cannot represent themselves; they must be
represented" (1997, p. 93). Marx falls into the trap of essentializing
the non-dominant world by assigning a false homogeneity to all of its
peoples. Aboriginal Peoples struggle against not only a western view of
history, but also against a western presentation of history, which
ignores among other things, oral histories and the value of story
telling (Smith, 1991). A failure to contest this approach allows for the
continued amputation of people from their cultures and histories. Fanon
writes: Every people in whose soul an inferiority complex has been
created by the death and burial of its cultural originality -- finds
itself face to face . . . with the culture of the \[dominant\] mother
country. The colonized is elevated above his jungle status in proportion
to his adoption of the mother country's cultural standards. (1967, p.
18) Fanon's analyses are as relevant today in colonial educational
settings globally, as they were to the Caribbean and Africa (about which
he was writing) in 1967. As many authors have argued, [a multicentric
approach to knowledge and learning is]{.underline} possible and I would
add [necessary, in a number of different contexts]{.underline} (see
Agrawal, 1995; Yakubu, 1994; Dei, 2000; Hodson, 1998). Similarly, a
number of applications of this knowledge are possible. It is necessary
then, that teachers operate pedagogically only on a multicentric
understanding and articulation of principles, strategies and goals. This
[multi-focal approach can contribute to]{.underline} what Dei has called
[a "complete history of ideas]{.underline} which have shaped and
continue to shape human growth and development" (2000, p. 17). Raising
these issues in the Canadian context [sheds light on broader questions
of knowledge production, the validation and dissemination of
information, and roles of power and representation in
education]{.underline}. Canada's [failure to teach and value accurate
and inclusive history must not be understood as benign omission, but
rather as part of its ongoing colonial project in which the power of
representation is paramount. Anticolonial historiography differs from
typical historical re-telling in that it takes an overtly strategic
approach to the telling of things past. Its]{.underline} focus is two
pronged, [working to interrogate and rupture dominant history on one
hand, while focusing on the achievements, practices and resistance of
oppressed peoples to colonial imposition on the other.]{.underline} It
is not the existence of a political project within anticolonial
historiography that distinguishes it from mainstream history, but rather
its [unabashed articulation of its political aims from the
start]{.underline}. This does not mean that we should dispense with
accuracy as a goal or direction for study. It means that [we must
contextualize the telling of history as well as history itself so the
why, who, where and how of knowledge production are brought into focus.
Objectivity is better sought through an interrogation of subjectivities
than through a denial that such competing perspectives
exist.]{.underline} In Discourse on Colonialism, Césairé (1972)
problematizes the subversive notion of history as a monologue. I argue
here that [history must be a dialogue -- a continually evolving
contestation of perspectives, versions and memories. History must move
beyond the notion of fractious divisions of time into past, present and
future]{.underline}. In place of such a partition, [a continuum of
knowledge must be fostered wherein knowing itself is understood as
embodied as well as temporal, and both as an individual and communal
path and practice, which identifies and values the subjectivities of
learners.]{.underline} The aim here is not a post-structuralist one,
wherein all perspectives are valued equally, but one in which light can
be shed on all experiences to reveal the bad and celebrate the good; one
in which invalid histories are exposed as such. On an individual level
this can assist in the development of what Freire has called "complete
humanism" (1997, p. 25). [On a community level, it can help to
facilitate the empowerment of marginalized groups.]{.underline}

#### Counter-interpretation -- affirmatives must defend an epistemic or political trajectory in response to the resolution as an archive of violence. This views the resolution as a jumping off point rather than an endpoint and includes strategies of historical storytelling as well as political reformism.

As I show especially in chapter 5, [American exceptionalism, progress,
and empire form a complicated and tortuous constellation, a
constellation that has been]{.underline} both formative and [destructive
of black existence. Americanstyle optimism in a future marked by greater
opportunity and freedom for American citizens]{.underline} (and nations
that endorse the nation's ideals and principles) [is intertwined with
the assumption that America is an exceptional nation, a "beacon" to the
rest of the world.]{.underline} In his influential book The American
Jeremiad, Sacvan Bercovitch traces American exceptionalism back to the
Puritan-inspired notion that America represents a New Israel, a nation
and people that have been chosen by God to redeem the world.29 The
imagined covenant between God and America ensures that the nation's
future is one of plenitude on the condition that America strives to
fulfill its mission to the other nations, a mission that entails the
expansion of internal and external borders. One example of this
missionary attitude is President McKinley's proposal to civilize and
Christianize America's "little brown brothers" in the Philippines at the
turn of the twentieth century, a proposal that justified America's
occupation of the Philippines. According to Bercovitch, as [civic
rituals and discourses perpetually reenact the idea of chosenness
(]{.underline}in religious and secular garb), [America increasingly
becomes a symbol of progress, freedom, and opportunity]{.underline}.30
He claims that prominent American writers and critics, including figures
of the nineteenth century like Emerson and Whitman, often ascribe these
ideals to America as if they are part of its essence, part of its
fundamental makeup. America, in fact, has privileged access to these
ideals; the world's success depends on America's capacity to embody and
spread the spirit of democracy. On Bercovitch's reading[, American
progress constitutes a unifying and unidirectional trajectory; progress,
as he points out, "denies divisiveness.]{.underline}"31 While Ellison
seems to have one foot in this all-too-familiar ideal of America and the
grammar of progress and optimism that accompanies this ideal, he also
pushes back against this framework. He contends that [progressive and
triumphant narratives rely on the denial of painful and uncomfortable
details of the nation's history. As he puts it, "A great part of our
optimism, like our progress, has been bought at the cost of ignoring the
\[troublesome\] processes through which we've arrived at any given
moment in our national existence."]{.underline}32 Ellison acknowledges
that there is something about our attachment to [American-style progress
that diminishes our capacity to remember and contemplate the tragic
underside of this movement and story.]{.underline} As Du Bois and
Ellison indicate, [progressive accounts of history have been complicit
with the violence of modern life. These narratives work to rationalize
the violence enacted against "less advanced" groups, people who need to
be civilized, saved, or brought into the fold of universal history.
Similarly, they encourage people to forget, deny, or downplay the
violence that happens against people of color in the name of
progress.]{.underline} As I show throughout this book, these concerns
about the dangers and erasures of progress resonate with the reflections
of Walter Benjamin, the literary critic of the twentieth century who is
often associated with the Frankfurt School. In his well-known essay "On
the Concept of History," Benjamin acknowledges that [progress is a
"storm," that this idea has justified and been complicit with numerous
historical catastrophes.]{.underline}33 But just as important for my
argument, he suggests that [progressive narratives vitiate our ability
to remember, contemplate, cite, and mourn these
catastrophes.]{.underline} For Benjamin, [progress renders history
coherent and harmonious by resolving the traumatic dimensions of
history, by incorporating history's traumas into affirmative accounts
that underwrite the positions of those in power]{.underline}. As he puts
it, [memory is always in danger of "becoming a tool of the ruling
classes," a situation that threatens to "murder the dead twice," to
erase and eliminate the dissonant quality of past suffering, injustice,
struggle, and loss.]{.underline}34 Think, for instance, of the way
Obama's presidency is often placed in [a linear trajectory that begins
with chattel slavery, travels through Lincoln and the Emancipation
Proclamation, traverses the civil rights movement, and culminates with
Obama's election.35 This kind of story places black American struggles
into a transparent, forward-marching story that easily makes sense of
and resolves past and present traumas and conflicts.]{.underline} In
other words, [we don't have to be disturbed by this ponderous racial
past because it has been lifted away, or is being lifted away, by the
achievements of the present.]{.underline} As McCain's speech shows us,
[Obama's victory might invoke the memory of racial suffering but this
dissonant memory is quickly superseded by an optimistic interpretation
of this historic moment that reassures us of American progress and
supremacy. The "triumphs" of the present enable us to explain away and
buffer ourselves from the unsettling quality of America's racial
history.]{.underline} Similarly, [overconfident claims about black
American advancement and racial progress assume that these achievements
have been distributed equally across class and gender lines. This
overconfidence screens from view the ways racial fears and anxieties,
traditionally directed toward black subjects, can get redirected and
attached to other bodies and communities that seemingly pose a threat to
the nation's well-being and collective images]{.underline}. But, as Du
Bois and Ellison also demonstrate, it is not easy to simply dismiss the
idea of progress in light of the multiple and conflicting ways that this
trope has been used, especially in the context of black freedom
struggles. I acknowledge that a basic notion of progress has inspired
many struggles, acts of resistance, and movements that many of us
admire. It is a concept that has been deployed, resignified, and enacted
by communities and individuals that have experienced the underside of
this concept and process. I think, for instance, of Martin Luther King's
faith in a universe that "bends toward justice." I also am reminded of
Theodor Adorno's claim that progress provides a preliminary "answer to
the doubt and the hope that things will finally get better, that people
will at least be able to breathe a sigh of relief."36 What would
critique, resistance, or political struggle mean apart from a minimal
notion of progress, a hope that the quality of life will improve,
especially for those groups that have been systematically marginalized?
I therefore acknowledge that progress, a trope that facilitates certain
ways of interpreting, constructing, and relating to historical change
and development, has had diferent meanings and connotations. (To claim,
for instance, that humanity necessarily moves forward, improves, and
approaches a state of fulfillment is not necessarily the same thing as
claiming that progress is the result of contingent human efforts,
interventions, and interactions.) I also take it that this idea is
intertwined with other fraught ideas and ideals that many people
cherish--- freedom, equality, inclusion, recognition, reconciliation,
agency, and so forth. Although I take seriously the complexities
involved with this category, in what follows I am primarily concerned
with [progress as a triumphant category, as a tool that helps to
reinforce, affirm, and justify the order of things (and conceal the
nasty aspects of the existing state of affairs).]{.underline} In other
words, this book specifically targets [narratives, images, and
strategies that rely on the denial or easy resolution of painful
tensions and contradictions in the past and present, those facets of
life that remind us that the status quo is harsh and cruel for many
people under its sway.]{.underline} While attachments to progress are
not always explicit, my sense is that [it lurks behind and discloses
itself in collective commitments to American exceptionalism, the
American Dream, a postracial society, leaving the past behind, and
spreading democracy and capitalism, even through war, to less
"developed" nations.]{.underline} For many people, [catastrophic events
in the modern age]{.underline}, like the Holocaust[, the slow
extermination of Native Americans, The Middle Passage]{.underline},
genocide in Rwanda, and perpetual wars [and ecological disasters, have
shattered the notion that history necessarily moves toward a more
complete and fulfilling state]{.underline}. At the same time, [this idea
of progress]{.underline} episodically flashes up. It [operates in both
subtle and explicit ways to mitigate and diminish the tragic qualities
of history and human existence. The denial of ongoing racial disparity
and violence is, in part, a result of our culture's yearning for a
future (and a present) that has been liberated from certain kinds of
unsettling losses, memories, and conflicts. If progress is the condition
of the possibility of hope in our culture, then this is a hope that has
little to no room for melancholy.]{.underline}

Towards a Decolonial Imaginary Scholarship on decoloniality offers a
critical perspective where [subaltern difference becomes the basis for
decolonizing deliberative democracy involving a critical engagement with
knowledges and cultural practices that were delegitimized by
colonialism]{.underline} (Faria et al., 2010). Decoloniality recognizes
the failure of the postcolonial state to live up to the promise of
decolonization and ['interrogates the postcolonial nation state as a
colonizing entity]{.underline} in the context of struggles over
Indigenous sovereignty' (Banerjee, 2021, p.4). Emerging from Latin
America, decolonial scholarship followed a different but related
trajectory than postcolonial studies, which was dominated by the work of
diasporic South Asian scholars trained in the English literary canons
and whose inaccessible writing had little to offer to non-English
speaking scholars (Misoczky, 2019). Settler colonialism in the Americas,
as we have discussed earlier, differed in significant ways from the
predominantly British colonialism in India, the Middle East and Africa,
which was the focus of postcolonial studies (Harding, 2017). The
fundamental critique of European colonialism by decolonial scholars was
similar to what was articulated earlier by postcolonial scholars[: the
fixing of difference based on a privileged Eurocentric position, racial
hierarchies, and the binary categorizations of primitive/modern,
developed/underdeveloped, and civilized/barbaric.]{.underline} However,
there is a temporal difference: while postcolonial scholarship refers
mainly to the nineteenth and twentieth centuries [decoloniality begins
from the moment of European invasion of the Americas in the fifteenth
century]{.underline} (Bhambra, 2014). Postcolonial scholarship's
obsession with culture and the fetishization of difference also diverted
criticism of capitalism and its associated inequalities and forms of
oppression, which are central to decolonial thinking (Dirlik, 1994).
Latin American scholars like Aníbal Quijano, María Lugones, Gloria
Anzaldúa, Maldonado-Torres and Walter Mignolo among others pioneered
scholarship with a [decolonial epistemic perspective that takes into
account diverse worldviews, particularly of subaltern racial and ethnic
populations from the Global South, to produce alternate epistemologies
that transcend the Western canon]{.underline}. Colonial difference
becomes the basis of the production of these subaltern knowledges
[resulting in a decolonized epistemology from the perspective of
marginalized populations]{.underline} (Mignolo, 2000). The notion of
coloniality is inextricably linked with modernity---[coloniality is
constitutive of modernity and hence 'there is no modernity without
coloniality and no coloniality without modernity']{.underline} (Mignolo
& Walsh, 2018, p. 4). This critical 'border thinking' (Anzaldúa, 1987)
is [the decolonial response to]{.underline} Habermas's Eurocentric
'unfinished project of [modernity']{.underline} from the perspective of
the oppressed and exploited side of the colonial difference (Grosfoguel,
2013, p. 26). Quijano's (2000, 2007) concept of [the coloniality of
power, which constitutes the global capitalist system in liberal
democracies, is central to decolonial thought.]{.underline} Coloniality
of power reflects [forms of domination that continued in democratic
postcolonial countries after the end of direct colonialism]{.underline},
reinforcing historical structural inequalities of the colonial era
(Ballestrin, 2015). Coloniality of power is [based on a Eurocentric
racialized classification of societies]{.underline} that was imposed on
Latin America after European invasion: the modernity that was designed
to break the shackles of the primitive past of postcolonial countries
also [embedded them in racial and ethnic hierarchies that constitute the
international division of labor]{.underline} (Grosfoguel, 2007; Quijano,
2007). Feminist philosophers have extended decolonial scholarship by
drawing attention to the coloniality of gender, which was neglected in
initial formulations of decoloniality (Harding, 2017; Lugones, 2010;
Manning, 2018). Decolonial feminism requires overturning the coloniality
of gender by a critical analysis of the racialized and capitalist forms
of gender oppression (Lugones, 2010). [Knowledge production has
generally been a one way street where theories that are produced in the
'global North' are imposed on the 'global South'
(]{.underline}Alcadipani et al., 2012). Producers of theories, including
democratic theories, have generally ignored postcolonial critiques and
subaltern theories. [This epistemic coloniality infects theories of
democracy in two ways]{.underline} requiring new modes of understanding:
first, there is a need to understand how [coloniality in democracy
produces inequality and injustice, conditions that will always hinder
the democratic project.]{.underline} Second, [democracy in coloniality
requires an understanding of how democracy is used to sustain
coloniality]{.underline} (Ballestrin, 2015). This is the essence of the
decolonial project. Such a [perspective can provide deeper insights into
understanding why and how democracies in postcolonial countries
'deviate' from the norm while also understanding how the norm itself is
constituted by colonial relations of power.]{.underline} Western powers,
to protect their own interests, have exported democracy to non-European
sites through soft power using international aid, trade deals, human
rights regimes and cultural exchange programs, backed up by military
power when these forms of persuasion fail or as Ballestrin (2015, p.
221) puts it, 'when the platforms of democracy and human rights serve to
justify contemporary imperial expansion, coloniality is imposed.'
Decoloniality is also rooted in praxis whereas much of postcolonial
scholarship is preoccupied with the cultural domain[. The starting point
for a decolonial praxis is to imagine radically different perspectives
that can dislodge Western rationality as the only basis of
reality]{.underline} (Mignolo & Walsh, 2018). This does not mean an
outright rejection of Western notions of progress, democracy and
development but involves a [critical reflexivity that can 'liberate the
production of knowledge, refection, and communication from the pitfalls
of European rationality/modernity']{.underline} (Quijano, 2007, p. 177).
Rather than lapse into fundamentalist thinking, a critique of
Eurocentric modernity is [a project of transmodernity]{.underline}
(Dussel, 2012), which involves [imagining multiple worlds and forms of
democratic alterity as opposed to the global imposition of a single
modernity and liberal form of democracy centered in Europe]{.underline}
(Grosfoguel, 2013). Transmodern forms of democracy entails decolonizing
the racial and capitalist bases of liberal democracy. [This
epistemological decolonization is a difficult task involving new forms
of intercultural understanding that could form the basis of alternate
rationalities]{.underline}. Merely bringing in non-Western perspectives
into the canon is not sufficient---for example describing an African
'ubuntu' ethics in a European academic journal may qualify as an
alternative moral theory but it still fails as a decolonization project
because this knowledge is interpellated in Western rules of validation
of knowledge and a coloniality of power (Naude, 2019). Perhaps
[understanding decolonial sites of dissent, resistance, and protest and
the multitude of livelihood struggles arising from a politics of
difference may enable us to imagine other worlds that are not defined by
Eurocentric modernity]{.underline} (Escobar, 2004). Many of these
struggles are about a [praxis of living and communal organizing that is
delinked from the modern capitalist nation state (]{.underline}Mignolo &
Walsh, 2018).

Decoloniality is not the same as political decolonization that occurred
during the 1800s in Latin America and the mid twentieth century in
Africa and Asia when former colonies gained independence and became new
nation states. The transition from colonialism to nationalism while
marking a postcolonial moment for the nation state excluded large
segments of its populations who were now governed by the same
rationality and coloniality of knowledge that inscribed the colonial
project. Recognition of ethnic minorities among postcolonial nations
does not challenge existing power relations or the dominant state model
of development. For instance, while the United Nations Declaration on
the Rights of Indigenous Peoples guaranteed their economic, cultural and
religious rights and the right to strengthen their social and political
institutions, it not clear how Indigenous peoples can actually exercise
these rights, because as Article 46 of the Declaration states: 'Nothing
in this Declaration may be interpreted as implying for any State,
people, group or person any right to engage in any activity or to
perform any act contrary to the Charter of the United Nations or
construed as authorizing or encouraging any action which would dismember
or impair, totally or in part, the territorial integrity or political
unity of sovereign and independent States'. However, [a decolonial
imaginary requires delinking from the 'political unity of sovereign and
independent states' because it is this unity that fixes colonial
difference within global power structures, disallowing other modes of
existence]{.underline}. Any [alternative framework must take into
account 'the epistemic force of local histories and to think theory
through the political praxis of subaltern groups, where the Other
becomes the original source of an ethical discourse']{.underline}
(Escobar, 2004, p. 217). In rejecting the universalizing and totalizing
claims of Western modernity, a [decolonial imaginary does not privilege
the nation state as a site for struggle because coloniality ensures that
the state cannot be decolonized or democratized]{.underline} (Mignolo &
Walsh, 2018). Instead, the decolonial project is a search for multiple
local and regional forms of governance that avoids the pitfalls of
undemocratic and repressive regimes which characterize contemporary
liberal democracies. Scholarship on Indigenous sovereignty in Australia,
the Americas and New Zealand has challenged dominant narratives about
the founding of these nation states and documented how a [false
political authority was claimed through land that was 'acquired'
forcibly or fraudulently and by unilateral extinguishment of native
title]{.underline} (Hendrix, 2010). The triumphalist narratives of
settler colonial states never pose the key question: '[Where does the
force of one law to extinguish the laws of the other draw its legitimacy
from'?]{.underline} (Watson, 2006, p. 29). This denial of [the original
violence of state sovereignty and colonial histories along with an
affirmation of Indigenous cultures becomes the basis of Indigenous
claims to sovereignty and self-determination]{.underline} (Volmert,
2010). Whether in settler colonies or post-colonial countries,
Indigenous groups with distinct preferences and cultures remain
marginalized minorities despite being bestowed with 'citizen rights.['
Rather than participate in public will formation Indigenous peoples have
the will of non-Indigenous citizens imposed on them and only a shift in
political authority can change their current situation.]{.underline}
While some [advocates of deliberative democracy may be 'greatly
skeptical about the chances of survival']{.underline} of Indigenous
communities (Benhabib, 2002, p. 185) their [ongoing struggles to protect
their lands indicate that resistance is fertile]{.underline} (Banerjee
et al., 2021). These communities have been fighting to preserve their
way of life since the colonial era began and their struggles continue in
the postcolonial era. [Colonial sovereignties of the modern nation state
supersede Indigenous sovereignty and where there is conflict and dissent
in deliberative procedures of public will formation the (post) colonial
state exercises coercive power to impose the will of 'the
people']{.underline}, as I discuss in the next section.

To answer the first claim---that [US rhetoric is the communication
practice of organizing people and materials to serve the needs of the
colonial settlement]{.underline}---I begin by looking at the
Aristotelian tradition's ongoing influence on the field. [Aristotle's
rhetoric is a publicfacing procedure for persuasion within a subjected
citizenry]{.underline}. Its objective: to find all means that might
convince an audience, not because dialectic deliberation will not work,
but because "affecting the decisions of juries and assemblies is a
matter of persuasiveness, not of knowledge." 1 [Rhetoricians in the
US]{.underline} still invested in Aristotle [must account for this
colonial carryover from Britain's Aristotelian tradition]{.underline}.
[It represents particular fo rms of [rhetorical]{.mark} criticism [and
pedagogical practices---like]{.mark} public speaking,
**[debate]{.mark}**, and oral defenses---that **[rely on a notion of
subjective]{.mark} citizenship and [sovereignty]{.mark}** [**rooted
in**]{.mark} a colonial (then **[settler colonial]{.mark})
[consciousness]{.mark}**]{.underline}.2 Lauer argues, for example, that
classical rhetoric was essential in propulsion of the Roman Republic
into the Roman Empire. As a result of Augustus's shift from deliberative
to epideictic rhetoric, the Roman Empire was able to sustain the spread
of Roman ideology onto lands that would have otherwise exceeded its
authority.3 Augustus knew that the legitimacy of the Roman Empire was
contingent upon the ability to shape public memory so that Roman law
would be seen as morally virtuous. Thus[, [the **rhetorical authority of
sovereignty** was used to justify]{.mark} the [expansion of]{.mark} the
Roman [Empire **as a function of the persuasive power of its
leaders**.]{.mark}]{.underline} Mary E. Stucky and John M. Murphy
describe the way [[rhetorical authority is used]{.underline}]{.mark},
much like the Romans, [[to]{.mark} also [remove native peoples from
their]{.mark} stewarded [lands for]{.mark} economic
[exploitation]{.mark} in the U]{.underline}S.4 In both cases,
[rhetorical subjection and [claims to sovereignty]{.mark} are
communicated onto bodies and lands, **[exert]{.mark}ing a [discursive
force]{.mark}** [that commits colonial violence]{.mark}.]{.underline}
[The practice of issuing rhetorical authority is intrinsically connected
to colonial modernity.]{.underline} From Aristotelian thought to the
middle of the twentieth century, "[rhetorical criticism" focused almost
exclusively on studying a speaker's capacity to persuade publics through
oratory.]{.underline}5 This meant [that a training in rhetoric required
studying "the texts of speeches delivered by the common and uncommon men
who attempted to crystallize and mold public thinking about the issues
of their day]{.underline}." 6 The [purpose of this training was not to
disrupt existing systems of domination but, rather, to replicate them:
as important as public address \[is\] itself in understanding \[US\]
American culture is the character of the training in rhetoric provided
by the nation's colleges and universities. Rhetoric and rhetorical
training ... reflect to some extent the demands and expectations of the
environment; the public image of the orator inevitably influences the
collegiate training of future orators.]{.underline}7 Raymie McKerrow
suggests that this tradition of training orators was reflected in the
field up until the critical turn in the 1970s where scholars then begin
to turn to rhetorical criticism of social justice movements and scholars
like Maurice Charland and Michael Calvin McGee begin to rethink
rhetorical subjectivity. McKerrow also credits Walter Fisher for work on
[narrative rhetoric]{.underline}, which McKerrow argues [gave the field
a language to study a "rational world paradigm" through narrative
fidelity---though this "world paradigm" was certainly not inclusive of
the indigenous narrative epistemologies]{.underline} already circulating
for centuries before the arrival of European rhetoric.8 While McKerrow
argues that the 1970s moved US rhetoric past its European colonial roots
and into a postmodern scholarly practice, [much of the field continues
to be entangled with processes of settler colonial modes of production:
invoking political subjectivities, authorizing sovereignty, and
narrating the settler colonial consciousness]{.underline}.9 Notably,
[the "the rhetoric of modernity" is a structural process driven by the
production of colonial subjects]{.underline} (i.e., Christian, white)
[and capitalist practices of production which originated in Europe and
were spread throughout the Americas via genocide, occupation,
enslavement, and war.]{.underline}10 Ultimately, the rhetoric of
modernity is about the sovereignty constructed through a European
ideological paradigm that was deduced from the rhetorical authority
invented by monarchs, trade companies, and churches. Furthermore, [that
sovereignty exerted over colonial subjects relies on a distribution of
settler colonial narratives that exist on a trajectory that has not
quite finished the settler colonial project; settling for [rhetorics of
liberal modernity]{.mark} simply "crucially [contributes to **blocking
out indigenous** ]{.mark}**peoples' [struggles]{.mark}** for a
post-settler colonial future."]{.underline} 11 Thus, it is not enough to
say that rhetoric is "the study" of how settler colonial ideology is
communicated. Rather, it [is a specific public-facing [communication
practice]{.mark} that [organize]{.mark}s [people and materials
(]{.mark}especially land) [to serve]{.mark} the needs of a
[settlement]{.mark} through claims of political
sovereignty]{.underline}. Furthermore, [[rhetoric]{.mark} produces and
[circulates narrative forms that **foreclose a postsettler
future**]{.mark} by **[reproducing]{.mark} the same sets of
[relationships]{.mark}** between bodies, lands, and power **both
[in]{.mark} our [research]{.mark} practices**]{.underline} (as I will
describe below) **[[and]{.mark} in our [pedagogies (like
debate]{.mark},]{.underline}** public speaking, etc). Claim #2:
[[assemblage theory frames rhetoric as an organizing logic]{.mark}
Embedded within the theory of assemblages is a way to consider how
**[communication moves ideological power]{.mark}** onto bodies and
throughout territories]{.underline}. [Research on White Settler
Governance (WSG)]{.underline} emerging from Canadian Cultural Studies
[reverberates]{.underline} Walter Mignolo and Lorenzo Veracini's
sentiment on [the importance of studying the mechanisms of production
behind settler colonialism]{.underline}. Scott Lauria Morgensen relies
on a framework rooted in Foucault's biopolitics and settler colonial
studies to describe how [WSG is founded by apparatuses of power that
persist in producing populations and institutions that can reproduce
settler logics]{.underline}: [the biopolitics of settler colonialism
will explain that the colonial era never ended ... . Theories of the
biopolitical state, regimes of global governance, and the war on terror
will be insufficient unless they critically theorise settler colonialism
as a historical and present condition and method of all such
power]{.underline}.12 [Settler colonialism]{.underline}, thus, [is **not
simply a condition** that afflicts native peoples and lands, **but is a
method [settler states]{.mark} undertake** in order to **[layer
ideological structures of]{.mark} settler
[production]{.mark}**]{.underline} like universities, hospitals, and
courts [onto yet settler-occupied territories.]{.underline} I argue that
**[this is a communicable method]{.underline}**. Patrick Wolfe suggests
WSG organizes and endures through material mechanisms of ideological
replacement, those that eliminate native peoples from lands and then
occupy those lands indefinitely: "settler colonizers come to stay:
invasion is a structure not an event ... elimination is an organizing
principal of settler-colonial society rather than a one-off (and
superseded) occurrence ... . Settler colonialism destroys to replace."
13 [What settler colonialism replaces,]{.underline} though, [is the
order of how sets of relations between lands, peoples, and ideologies
are mapped out onto invaded territories. As a structure of settler
ideological power---or what I refer to as an
assemblage]{.underline}---[[WSG]{.mark} persist in
[territorializ]{.mark}ing [native lands and eliminat]{.mark}ing native
[peoples through]{.mark} **organizing [logics of]{.mark} subjectivity
and [sovereignty]{.mark}** **[circulated through narratives]{.mark} of
settler logic.**]{.underline} [Conventional rhetoric's "**[agonistic"
emphasis on evaluating]{.mark} the efficacy** of a]{.underline} given
presidential address, [**[congressional debate]{.mark}**, or other
communicative practice is inherently conservative, and thus settler
colonial, for it [positions the WSG]{.mark} statu[s quo as a
given]{.mark}]{.underline}; that is, [when the organizing logics of
settler colonialism are communicated effectively, this is "effective"
rhetoric]{.underline}. Therefore, to frame rhetoric as the communicable
organizing logics of WSG, a study of assemblages is warranted. For
Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, [assemblages are an "ad hoc logic"
about the ways social formations rely on a combination of heterogeneous,
material and human parts to create change.]{.underline}14 [Assemblages
are like self-replicating, overdetermined political machines where many
seemingly random materials are arranged in a self-reinforcing fashion to
produce and sustain a particular outcome]{.underline}. While Deleuze and
Guattari's understanding of political desire is ultimately framed in the
context of late capitalism, [thinking through]{.underline} their
conception of [assemblage as it is moved by a settler colonial
desire]{.underline}---a desire Mignolo asserts is dually capitalistic
and genocidally white supremacist---[warrants a discussion of how
political ideologies of domination are assembled by rhetorical
logics.]{.underline} For one, assemblages are not things, and they do
not produce things; they are arrangements of things.15 Assemblages,
though, do territorialize and code particular annunciations with an
organizing logic. In this case, [materials and bodies are arranged and
mobilized on territories according to the logics of settler desire
(resource extraction, labor extraction, and genocide]{.underline}),
which has the dual effect of creating the conditions for settler logic
to reproduce. For DeLanda, this point is particularly important: what
one feels as an effect (or affect) from assemblages is the sense that
territories are being reshaped and bodies recoded to be more conducive
to the reproduction of the assemblage.16 This facet of assemblages
intersects with the biopolitical study of WSG by explaining the ways
[**[ideological structures]{.mark}** of power **[arrange racial and
economic hierarchies]{.mark}** in the service of [producing]{.mark} the
[conditions by which settler colonialism can
reproduce]{.mark}.]{.underline} The other facet of assemblage, and the
one that pertains most to the study of rhetoric, is Deleuze and
Guattari's concept of the abstract machine. [An assemblage comprises the
abstract machine, the concrete (material) components, and the personae
(bodies]{.underline}). The abstract machine is the organizing logic of
an assemblage: "the condition of an assemblage is abstract because it is
not a thing or object that exists in the world, but rather something
that lays out a set of relations wherein concrete elements and agencies
appear." 17 Thus, the abstract machine of an assemblage organizes the
materials (including and especially land) and personae of the assemblage
in a way that their sets of relationships affect the flows of power
toward a particular desire. In the case of WSG, [the capacity to call
settler colonial subjects into being, the capacity to make sovereignty
claims over native lands, and the capacity to normalize this invasive
process through religious or grand global political narrative is
organized by the abstract machine of settler logic]{.underline}---or
what I described earlier as rhetoric. The [abstract machine layers power
over bodies and lands in a way that reshapes them to reproduce
structures of settler power]{.underline}. In other words, [settler
colonial governance is an assemblage of ideological power]{.underline}
in North America [that territorializes the lands stewarded by native
peoples, codes the bodies of native, Mestizx, and black peoples as
Other, and **shapes rhetorical/communicable landscapes** into **spaces
conducive to the reproduction of the settlement**.]{.underline}
[Rhetoric is the organizing logic of this white settler assemblage that
is continuously communicated (discursively and affectively) to arrange
the relationships between settler bodies, native bodies, occupied lands,
and technologies of occupation. These tenets of rhetoric are articulated
in the organizational logic of settler colonialism. We cannot undo
settler colonialism unless we confront the **normalization of these
logics** and begin to rearticulate an anticolonial praxis-driven method
for studying rhetoric.]{.underline} This work---if it assumes that
conventional rhetoric is, in fact, the organizing logic of the settler
colonial assemblage in North America---[can undo our complicity as
rhetoricians to reproduce settler colonialism.]{.underline}

The Radical Imagination The preceding section examines how colonial
ideologies and discourses were reinforced and challenged in financial
literacy texts targeting Indigenous people. I have undertaken such an
analysis not in the name of improving Indigenous financial literacy
education or making any suggestions regarding alternatives: as a settler
subject in Canada, I don't believe that is my place. Rather, I wish to
ask what we, as settlers (and those who, more broadly, benefit from
settler colonialism), can learn from the foregoing discussion as it
relates to [the radical transformation of settler culture, society,
economics, and politics. How Indigenous people organize and strategize
to survive and rebel against colonialist neoliberal extractive
capitalism is vitally important]{.underline}, but not my jurisdiction
(see Lowman and Barker 2015). I am interested in how settlers, the
beneficiaries of colonialist neoliberal extractive capitalism (to
different extents, based on class, race, gender, and other forms of
oppression; see, e.g., Day 2016), can better rebel from within, in part
by learning from (and taking risky action in solidarity with) Indigenous
struggles. For me, [the notion of the radical imagination is crucial.
The radical imagination in this sense implies the ability to recognize
that the present social order is neither inevitable nor necessary; there
have been, there are, and there could yet be other modes for organizing
social life]{.underline} (see Graeber 2007). Here, [the example of
Indigenous social, political, and economic systems in the past and in
the present can be vital,]{.underline} though we are wise to recognize
that gazing at them can also invite the colonial maneuver of
romanticization and appropriation. [The radical imagination is not a
normative category and does not map neatly onto any one ideological,
political, or identitarian approach]{.underline}. Rather, as Cornelius
Castoriadis (1997a) argues, [the radical imagination is a constant force
of disruption, questioning, and creativity working at the very core of
the individual and of society.]{.underline} Castoriadis (1997b) posed
the radical imagination as [the elemental protean substance of the human
subject, but also of social institutions writ large. The institutions of
marriage, the police, and the education system, all social power
formations, even when concretely or brutally material, are held in place
and reproduced through the imaginative work of social
actors.]{.underline} Castoriadis likens it to magma, a substance that is
at times fluid but at other times solidifies, only to become liquid
again at the next tectonic eruption. Following Castoriadis, Alex
Khasnabish and I have approached the radical imagination not as a
private possession located in the mind of the individual but as [a
collective process that emerges from dialogue, debate,]{.underline} and
peoples' often fraught and difficult solidarity in the face of social
power relations (Haiven and Khasnabish 2014). From Robin D. G. Kelley's
(2002) study of the traditions of the Black radical imagination we have
learned about the way [the radical imagination echoes between social
movements, cultural producers, and intellectuals, not only within
particular struggles and locales but globally in an interconnected
age.]{.underline} This approach affirms Marcel Stoetzler and Nira
YuvalDavis's (2002) argument that the [imagination is not some
transcendental universal force but a situated one, contingent on how it
is diversely expressed and articulated in bodies intersected by the
forces of racialization, gender expression, sexuality, citizenship,
ability, and so on]{.underline}.

ONCE UPON a time [scholars assumed that the knowing subject
in]{.underline} [the disciplines is transparent, disincorporated from
the known and untouched by the geo-political configuration of the world
in which people are racially ranked and regions are racially
configured]{.underline}. From a detached and neutral point of
observation (that Colombian philosopher Santiago Castro-Gómez (2007)
describes as the hubris of the zero point[), the knowing subject maps
the world and its problems, classifies people and projects into what is
good for them.]{.underline} Today that assumption is no longer tenable,
although there are still many believers. At stake is indeed the question
of racism and epistemology (Chukwudi Eze, 1997; Mignolo, forthcoming).
And once upon a time scholars assumed that if you 'come' from Latin
America you have to 'talk about' Latin America; that in such a case you
have to be a token of your culture. Such expectation will not arise if
the author 'comes' from Germany, France, England or the US. In such
cases it is not assumed that you have to be talking about your culture
but can function as a theoretically minded person. As we know: the first
world has knowledge, the third world has culture; Native Americans have
wisdom, Anglo Americans have science. The need for political and
epistemic delinking here comes to the fore, as well as decolonializing
and de-colonial knowledges, necessary steps for imagining and building
democratic, just, and non-imperial/colonial societies. [Geo-politics of
knowledge goes hand in hand with geo-politics of knowing. Who and when,
why and where is knowledge generated]{.underline} (rather than produced,
like cars or cell phones)? [Asking these questions means to shift the
attention from the enunciated to the enunciation]{.underline}. And by so
doing, turning Descartes's dictum inside out: [rather than assuming that
thinking comes before being, one assumes instead that it is a racially
marked body in a geo-historical marked space that feels the urge or get
the call to speak, to articulate, in whatever semiotic
system]{.underline}, the urge that makes of living organisms 'human'
beings. By setting the scenario in terms of geo- and body-politics I am
[starting and departing from already familiar notions of 'situated
knowledges']{.underline}. Sure, [all knowledges are situated and every
knowledge is constructed]{.underline}. But that is just the beginning.
The question is: [who, when, why is constructing knowledges]{.underline}
(Mignolo, 1999, 2005 \[1995\])? [Why eurocentered epistemology carefully
hidden]{.underline} (in the social sciences, in the humanities, in the
natural sciences and professional schools, in think tanks of the
financial sector and the G8 or G20), its own geo-historical and
bio-graphical locations? The shift I am indicating is the anchor
(constructed of course, located of course, not just anchored by nature
or by God) of the argument that follows. It is [the beginning of any
epistemic de-colonial de-linking with all its historical, political and
ethical consequences. Why? Because geo- historical and bio-graphic loci
of enunciation have been located by and through the making and
transformation of the colonial matrix of power]{.underline}: a racial
system of social classification that invented Occidentalism (e.g. Indias
Occidentales), that created the conditions for Orientalism;
distinguished the South of Europe from its center (Hegel) and, on that
long history, remapped the world as first, second and third during the
Cold War. [Places of nonthought]{.underline} (of myth, non-western
religions, folklore, underdevelopment involving regions and people[)
today have been waking up from the long process of westernization.
The]{.underline} anthropos inhabiting non-European places discovered
that \[they\] had been invented, as anthropos, by a locus of
enunciations self-defined as humanitas.

### 2AC \-- FW \-- Subject Formation

#### 1 \-- Debate does shape subject formation \-- but not the way they think it does \-- they are correct that their model of debate is going nowhere, the conversations that take place over policy proposals are never exported bc only a small fraction of debaters can ever actualize them but epistemic reorientations can be adopted and forwarded by anyone and shape subjectivity through the process of debate itself \-- reading shcolarship in debate increases exposure to it and forces other teams to engage it and think through its arguments which iteratively creates consciousness that can be mobilized against cybernetic thought -- even if its not 100% any risk of reorienting the direction of debate within this round is good -- alt causes don't disprove the risk of debate contributing to subject formaiton

#### 2 \-- Antagonism is wrong -- our iterative process of subject formation overcomes it -- in the initial days of the louisville project that prioritized affective strategies they lost a lot of debates and encouraged policy debaters to recommit to their ideologies but eventually as they started winning major tournamets and eventually took several NDTs the debate community writ large was forced to shift its norms to account for the inevitable presence of kritikal argumentation and refine predisposations that they had previously held -- i.e. the cumulative effect of many ballots solves our offense

#### 3 \-- Even if they say "its just one ballot" your ballot is an ethical commitment -- this argument is bidirectional -- your ballot cannot impose fairness onto debate writ large -- k deabaters read their shit and disrupt procedural fairness regardless of whether or not you vote aff, your ballot can only impose a fraemwork on this debate in line with one of two competing theories for what the ballot could function as -- either you vote aff and use the ballot to align this debate with counter-revolutionary tactics that bracket out marginalized scholarship or you vote neg and participate in the revolution -- make your ballot one of the thousand ballots that change norms in debate -- anythig else is self defeating -- why vote in elections if your ballot alone isn't the brink ? bc that logic applied to every ballot would be counter-revolutionary and actually preclude change

Remedy procedural inequity ? why is it proportional to the fairness lost
by the aff, why doesn't it just incentivize affs to write a better 2AC

Cory johnson -- lawyer getting phd running for political office

### 2AC \-- FW \-- AT: Fairness

#### 1 \-- It's a sliding scale -- sacrificing a marginal amount of procedural fairness in order to build a net more ethical game is better than maintaining the gold standard of fairness while pushing indigenous debaters out of the activity \-- decades of topic based policy debate let to almost no minority participation---A few years of allowing alternative approaches has significantly increased it---[It's not a coincidence.]{.underline}

#### 2 \-- Their interpretation creates an arbitrary burden of "exportability" on marginalized debaters that the negative gets to circumvent through fabricated white debate norms such as fiat that decreases the burdens debate places on white political strategies -- this turns their fairness claims by forcing us to delineate the macropolitical implementation of our methods while all they have to do is read an eight second plan text. 

#### 3 \-- Structural unfairness outweighs and reverses your decisionmaking calculus -- they have conceded a uniqueness claim status quo is not a level playing field but rather is structurally skewed against indigenous scholarship and marginalized debaters writ large-- if your role is to vote for the most fair model of debate overall then you vote negative to correct for the foundational imbalance that exists in debate which requires some instances of procedural unfairness towards normative policy debaters in order to establish competitive equilibrium

#### 4 \-- Confrontation with colonialism necessitates epistemic disobedience -- refusal to conform to the rules of the game calls into question the assumptions that sustain racialized violence within debate.

apparatus of enunciation]{.underline}.2 I have been supporting in the
past those who maintain that [it is not enough to change the content of
the conversation, that it is of the essence to change the terms of the
conversation. Changing the terms of the conversation implies going
beyond disciplinary or interdisciplinary controversies and the conflict
of interpretations. As far as controversies and interpretations remain
within the same rules of the game (terms of the conversation), the
control of knowledge is not called into question. And in order to call
into question the modern/colonial foundation of the control of
knowledge, it is necessary to focus on the knower rather than on the
known. It means to go to the very assumptions that sustain locus
enunciations.]{.underline} In what follows I revisit the formal
apparatus of enunciation from the perspective of geo- and bio-graphic
politics of knowledge. My [revisiting is epistemic rather than
linguistic, although focusing on the enunciation is unavoidable if we
aim at changing the terms and not only the content of the
conversation]{.underline}. The basic assumption is that [the knower is
always implicated, geo- and body-politically, in the known,]{.underline}
although [modern epistemology]{.underline} (e.g. the hubris of the zero
point) managed to conceal both and [created the figure of the detached
observer, a neutral seeker of truth and objectivity who at the same time
controls the disciplinary rules and puts \[themself\] in a privileged
position to evaluate and dictate.]{.underline} The argument is
structured as follows. Sections I and II lay out the ground for the
politics of knowledge geo-historically and bio-graphically, contesting
the hegemony of zero point epistemology. In Section III, I explore three
cases in which geo- and body-politics of knowledge comes forcefully to
the fore: one from Africa, one from India and the third from New
Zealand. These three cases are complemented by a fourth from Latin
America: my argument is here. It is not the report of a detached
observer but the intervention of a de-colonial project that 'comes' from
South America, the Caribbean 4 Theory, Culture & Society 26(7--8) and
Latinidad in the US. Understanding the argument implies that the reader
will shift its geography of reasoning and of evaluating arguments. In
Section IV, I come back to geo- and body-politics of knowledge and their
epistemic, ethical and political consequences. In Section V, I attempt
to pull the strings together and weave my argument with the three cases
explored, hoping that what I say will not be taken as the report of a
detached observed but as the intervention of a de-colonial thinker. In
semiotics, a basic distinction has been made (Emile Benveniste) between
the enunciation and the enunciated. The distinction was necessary, for
Benveniste, to ground the floating sign central to Ferdinand de
Saussure's semiology and its development in French structuralism.
Benveniste turned to the enunciation and, by doing so, to the subject
producing and manipulating signs, rather than the structure of the sign
itself (the enunciated). With this distinction in mind, I would venture
to say that [the interrelated spheres of the colonial matrix of
power]{.underline} (economy, authority, gender and sexuality, and
knowledge/subjectivity[) operate at the level of the enunciated while
patriarchy and racism are grounded in the enunciation]{.underline}.
Let's explore it in more detail (Benveniste, 1970; Todorov, 1970).

### 2AC \-- FW \-- AT: Clash

#### 1 \-- Our interpretation doesn't sanction choosing any interpretation of the resolution but rather delimits the means by which we access discussions of water protection

#### 2 \-- Their iterative testing arguments are irrelevant -- there's no value in applying it to the resolution because we don't adopt the resolution at the end of the season so finding the "best policy option" is immaterial, only our interp allows us to test things we can actually implement

#### 3 \-- Our top level criticism of their interpretation turns clash -- if we win any of our reasons why debates under their interpretation result in unethical subject formation then their defense of clash reflects a drive to perfect modes of racialized violence -- refinement and reflexivity over a political project that is fundamentally colonial can only ever produce more efficacious forms of exclusion

### 2AC \-- FW \-- AT: Skills/Deliberation

#### 1 \-- Erasure DA -- their interpretations reliance on the fiated evaluation of consequences as the "correct" modality of skill building and competitive testing replicates the logics of indigenous boarding schools in which white teachers viewed themselves as being neutral adjudicators providing native children with the portable skills they needed to function and succeed in settler society -- their model of debate preserves the colonial order of knowledge within debate by training indigenous debaters in the art of conceding to the coercive regime of the settler state while expunging the cultural divergence of critical indigenous theory that never gets debated under their model -- criticism on the level of knowledge production is a core strategy of indigenous liberation that allows for a re-reading of the world on the terms of alternative thought systems and offers a basis to criticize the tacit epistemic assumptions that sustain settler governance -- we'll cross apply the haiven card from the alt debate -- it indicates that settler society is held in place by the imagination of social actors which means that alternative imaginations on the level of research paradigms should be engaged and deliberated over in debate in order to challenge the core of settler power

#### 2 \-- Cruel optimism DA -- their interpretation forces indigenous debaters to invest their affective and pychological labor into political structures that in the real world have never and will never work towards their liberation -- this is a cross application of the ontology debate, this reproduces false hope that causes psychological violence and racial battle fatigue -- how is the aff going to stand up and tell indigenous people to continue expending their psychic energy on a losing battle ? this comes first because it forecloses meaningful engagement with things like clash and research skills -- education and fairness both come secondary to inclusion -- its an ethical d rule that controls who the debate space is for in the first place

#### 3 \-- Their model of procedural fairness and clash is premised on the value of deliberative democratic discouse as a model of producing effective and rational decisionmaking -- this legitimates colonial violence by assuming the absence of imperial asymmetries of power in discursive spaces.

The Contents and Discontents of Deliberative Democracy The year 2019
will be remembered as the year of protest with millions of people taking
to the streets in Africa, Asia, the Americas and Europe to express their
frustration with their political leaders. We appear to be in the middle
of a democratic recession: approval ratings for most politicians and
political parties across the world are abysmal, there are deep divisions
in most Western democracies, and public trust in democratic institutions
are at record lows (Fishkin & Mansbridge, 2017). The democratic boom
following the wave of political decolonization in the 1950s and the end
of the Cold War appears to be well and truly over with the rise of
authoritarianism, social unrest, state repression of dissent, increasing
human rights violations, government crackdown on free speech, violent
conficts over natural resource extraction and an increase in modern
slavery, all of which are happening in 'democratic' countries (Amnesty
International, 2019). Democracy, or at least the model of dominant party
system representative democracy in Europe and the United States appears
to be under threat. [The recognition that in modern liberal Western
democracies formal democracy through majority rule precluded genuine
participation of citizens led to a 'deliberative turn']{.underline} in
democratic theory in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The deliberative
turn, pioneered by the philosophies of Habermas and Rawls and further
elaborated by political theorists like Cohen, Dryzek, Fishkin, Gutmann,
Mansbridge, and Thompson among others, began as a normative project that
focused on [deliberation as an ideal rational discourse where consensus
was reached freely and without coercion. Political legitimacy was thus
established through deliberative processes that refected the discursive
quality of decision making]{.underline} rather than representation
through voting. [Rationality of a democracy]{.underline} according to
Habermas (1975, p. 32) was less about majority rule, which could not
represent the interests of all citizens, but [should be based on the
'genuine participation of citizens in political will formation.' Thus,
more participatory forms of democracy required a deliberative ideal
involving a discursive process where citizens could freely communicate
as equals to arrive at a rational consensus on decisions]{.underline}
afecting their lives. Merely acknowledging diferences and inequalities
does not make them disappear. Rather than seek an authoritarian
consensus, a truly deliberative framework would need to accommodate
confict and dissent as well. Moufe (1999) argues that a preoccupation
with procedural issues relating to consensus depoliticizes the public
sphere and that a robust and vibrant public sphere needs to embrace
confict and dissent. A more radical and progressive democratic politics
would transform antagonism into 'agonistic pluralism' where political
contestations refect not 'antagonism between enemies but agonism between
adversaries' (Moufe, 1999, p. 754). The aim is to 'domesticate'
destructive antagonism into a constructive agonism where democratic
decisions may or may not be fully consensual but can also respectfully
accept unresolvable disagreements' (Hillier, 2003, p. 42). Or as
Foucault (1984, p. 379) puts it 'one must not be for consensuality, but
one must be against nonconsensuality.' Deliberative democrats have
acknowledged these critiques and attempted to broaden the scope of
deliberative democracy to accommodate exclusions and inequalities. For
instance, consensus---the desired outcome of deliberation---was seen as
not always desirable even when possible (Gutmann & Thompson, 2018).
Habermas's later work also adopted a more fexible approach,
acknowledging that '[in the case of controversial existential questions
arising from diferent worldviews even the most rationally conducted
discursive engagement will not lead to consensus']{.underline}
(Habermas, 2001, p. 43). The task then of a successful [deliberative
politics is to institutionalize appropriate procedures that can enable
rational discourse among informed publics. This 'public sphere' is the
institutionalized discursive space where ordinary citizens could
deliberate about politics, the economy, and other issues that afected
their lives]{.underline}. Habermas's notion of a public sphere was based
on a historical analysis of the emergence of new forms of public
interaction that took place in cofee houses, salons, and public squares
during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. However, feminist and
po[stcolonial scholars have critiqued Habermas's notion of public sphere
as being exclusionary and lacking in open access, participation and
social equality that are key to democratic deliberation. If the public
sphere was the space where consensus was being manufactured it becomes a
new site of hegemonic domination]{.underline} (Fraser, 1990). [The
merchants and intellectuals who deliberated]{.underline} in cafes and
salons about the weighty political and social issues of their time would
in all probability have not appreciated the fact that the cofee they
consumed was produced by slave labor in the colonies (Eze, 1997).
Moreover, as Fraser (1990) points out, [opinion forming in the public
sphere does not translate into actual decision-making in the political
sphere, and even if such an extension were possible it would entrench
existing hegemonies and reinforce existing structural inequalities and
exclusions.]{.underline} While ideal conditions of deliberative
discourse may exist and enable rational consensus among wealthy
residents of suburban Frankfurt or Princeton deliberating about the
installation of additional streetlights in their neighborhood, [it is
difcult to imagine how Indigenous communities in the Brazilian Amazon
can engage in deliberative discourse as equal citizens with powerful
market and state actors intent on expanding mining and logging on
Indigenous lands. Even in urban contexts it would be naïve to expect
that citizens can participate as equals, respectfully, and exercise
their reason freely given the realities of structural inequalities and
discriminations based on race, class, gender and sexual
orientation.]{.underline} Another [signifcant shortcoming in
deliberative theories is its lack of a sophisticated analysis of power,
which seems to be treated almost like an exogenous variable. The liberal
quest for legitimacy seemingly elides notions of power and authority
because a key assumption of the deliberative ideal is the absence of
coercive power. Legitimacy of a consensus produced by communicative
rationality can also be hegemonic because one cannot assume that
legitimacy always exists without domination]{.underline} (Clegg, &
Haugaard, 2009; Moufe, 1999). Some scholars argue that deliberative
democracy has a 'nuanced view of power' because it acknowledges that
coercive power can exist in deliberative practice (Curato et al., 2017,
p. 31). However, [they claim it is possible to limit coercive power
through good 'procedural design']{.underline} involving selection of
'less partisan' participants, using independent facilitators or making
deliberations public. [Such an approach to power is patently
unsatisfactory because it elides relationships between power, legitimacy
and authority. How does 'procedural design' handle dissent or confict?
And if there is no dissent or confict in deliberations then has there
been an elite capture of the process by excluding or marginalizing
dissenting stakeholders? Deliberative democrats also assume that power,
and sometimes coercion, is needed in a deliberative process, especially
when implementing decisions contested by certain groups even if the
deliberative process was fair]{.underline} and reasoned (Curato et al.,
2017). So the assumption is that the state, the only 'legitimate' source
of coercive power, can and should use coercion to implement decisions
arrived at in deliberative forums. As we shall see later when we discuss
conficts over natural resources, this is clearly an untenable argument
because [it legitimizes the use of state violence to implement decisions
made in deliberative forums characterized by vastly structurally unequal
conditions that disempower marginalized populations. Debates about
deliberative democracy elide power dynamics in the broader political
economy]{.underline} in which deliberative processes are embedded
(Dryzek, 2016). In cases where [there are signifcant power asymmetries
and where actions can have serious economic, social and environmental
impacts on communities as is the case with extractive industries,
procedural design, however carefully designed, cannot accommodate
divergent and sometimes incommensurable views]{.underline} on land use.
Rather institutional, material, and discursive power that constitute the
global political economy determine governance structures and processes
of natural resource extraction. [These forms of power somehow remain
'outside' of deliberative discourse but create particular forms of
legitimacy that deny pluralism of values and rationalities thus
marginalizing the legitimate struggles of populations whose values do
not conform to the 'norm']{.underline} (Banerjee, 2018, p. 804). To
summarize: despite its shortcomings there appears to be consensus among
scholars in the feld that a deliberative process can 'help revive
democratic legitimacy, provide for more authentic public will formation,
provide a middle ground between widely mistrusted elites and the angry
voices of populism, and help fulfll some of our common normative
expectations about democracy' (Fishkin & Mansbridge, 2017, p. 6). But is
this optimism unfounded? What are the silences and erasures in
deliberative democracy? Are there limits to 'authentic public will
formation' and 'democratic legitimacy' that marginalize segments of the
citizenry? These are some questions I explore in the next section.
Postcolonial and Decolonial Deliberations What is remarkable about the
various debates in deliberative democracy is the silence about Western
colonialism, especially in Habermas's universalizing notion of
communicative rationality. Similar silences can be seen in the work of
some Enlightenment thinkers whose concession (and complicity) to slavery
and colonialism is paradoxical and puzzling given their proclamations of
universal freedom (Dhawan, 2014; Eze, 1997). Enlightenment reasoning and
philosophies of history provided an intellectual justifcation of more
than two hundred years of colonialism. There was little awareness that
the much-celebrated use of reason also creates new forms of domination,
even more insidious than coercive power because these forms of
domination are justifed by reason itself (Adorno & Horkheimer, 1972).
[Liberal ideas of freedom, progress, development, and democracy are
deeply embedded in the idea of Empire, whose mission involved political
subjugation of those it sought to empower and civilize without a
critical refexivity of the impact of European colonialism on European
philosophy]{.underline} (Banerjee & Arjaliès, 2021). Even the Frankfurt
School, despite its infuential work on domination in modern society and
critiques of the Enlightenment, is as Said (1993, p. 278) points out
'stunningly silent on racist theory, anti-imperialist resistance, and
oppositional practice in the empire'. It is important we engage with
these critiques to arrive at a more nuanced understanding of the complex
historical relationships between colonialism and democracy and more
importantly identify what traces continue to exist in contemporary
political thought. As Fabian (2002, p. 33) points out, good or bad
intentions do not alone invalidate knowledge: for that to happen 'it
takes bad epistemology which advances cognitive interests without regard
for its ideological presuppositions.' And certainly one could argue
[there is an epistemological closure in EuroAmerican representations of
democracy that does not recognize attempts by postcolonial countries to
create their own forms of governance consistent with their own
conceptions of freedom and rights because they may not conform to
'ideal' standards]{.underline} (Koelble & Lipuma, 2008). If
Enlightenment inspired ideas of democracy elides historical facts about
slavery and colonialism then it becomes imperative to reimagine
democracy while maintaining the Enlightenment's spirit of critique, or
as Marx puts it ['the weapon of the criticism cannot replace criticism
of the weapon]{.underline}.'

After the Treaty of Nanjing concluding the First Opium War,
[Anglo-American]{.underline} "[free trade]{.underline}" [practices in
China and]{.underline} in the new colony of [Hong Kong required new
measures in liberal government that included]{.underline} improvised
**[emergency powers]{.underline}**, **[compulsory registration of non-
Europeans]{.underline}**, **[and military and police
regulations]{.underline}** to suppress social unrest and riots. [[The
liberal rule of law provided for the state's]{.underline}
"[legitimate]{.underline}" [violence against]{.underline}]{.mark} the
threat of "illegitimate" violence from others it deemed
[[criminals]{.underline}]{.mark}, dissenters, and disturbers of the
"peace." [These military]{.underline}, naval, [and police regulations
employed in the name of]{.underline} "[liberty]{.underline}" [became
regular parts of]{.underline} the [governance]{.underline} of both Hong
Kong and the Chinese treaty ports, until the century's end. By the
latter half of the nineteenth century, a large migrant Chinese
population, displaced by famine, poverty, and the war with England, was
criminalized in Hong Kong by English law, producing a significant part
of the population of "coolies" exported from the treaty ports to North
and South America, the Caribbean, Australia, Hawaii, and other parts of
Asia. Needless to say, these connections are not represented as such in
the colonial archive. Rather, [through]{.underline} unlikely,
[contiguous methods of reading]{.underline} correspondence,
[treaties]{.underline}, [and legal ordinances]{.underline}, [we may find
[a genealogy of liberal governance]{.mark} that **[discloses its role in
imperial innovation]{.mark}**]{.underline}.35

Correspondence between Governors and the Foreign Office suggests that
[the British aimed]{.underline} both [to accommodate residual practices
and]{.underline} to [experiment with new logics]{.underline}. British
rule in the new Crown Colony of Hong Kong in the early nineteenth
century included colonial conquest and martial law to claim land and
organize the conduct of the colonized population, yet it profited from
promoting nominally "free" yet coerced migrant labor. It refined methods
for profit that drew from practices resembling both monopoly and "free
trade," and it employed an older-style colonial occupation with new
forms of security to govern "free" movement outside and beyond directly
occupied territories. In other words, the history of liberalism in the
context of the British trades with India and China after the First Opium
War included both the promotion of ideas of freedom, free labor, and
free trade, and the elaboration of specific modes for governing liberty
in the colonies and beyond.

[There is]{.underline} arguably [no better authority than]{.underline}
John Stuart [Mill]{.underline} for our specification of the principles
of liberal government in the nineteenth century. [[Mill's
corpus]{.underline}]{.mark} exemplifies a system of liberal thought
unique in both range and specificity; it [[presents a]{.mark} synthetic
[worldview, whose elements]{.mark}]{.underline}---[education, moral
philosophy]{.underline}, laws, political economy,
[government]{.underline}, [and logic]{.underline}---mediate and
**[[manage]{.mark} the problem of [government in]{.mark}]{.underline}**
Britain and in **[[the]{.underline}]{.mark}** larger
**[[empire]{.underline}]{.mark}**. His ideas on education were at the
center of his system of moral and social progress and exemplified his
teleology of improvement, the end of which was the common good. In his
essays on education, as well as in the Autobiography, On Liberty, and
Representative Government, [he emphasized education, as the crucial
means to]{.underline} moral and social [progress]{.underline}. [[Liberal
education]{.underline}]{.mark} was not merely training in languages and
literature, mathematics and scientific method, logic, history, political
economy, and law, but more allegorically, it is what gives "a
comprehensive and connected view of the things . . . already learnt
separately, a philosophic study of the Methods of the sciences; the
modest in which the human intellect proceeds from the known to the
unknown."36 Mental and moral development [[depended on]{.underline}
**[reflection]{.underline}**]{.mark}, speculation, and improvement,
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[**cooperation with others** to promote
the common good]{.underline}]{.mark}.37 **[[Education was necessary for
character formation]{.underline}]{.mark}**, socialization, **[and the
proper development of the moral and civic subjectivity of
the]{.underline}** "**[competent agent]{.underline}**" **[[within
deliberative participatory democracy]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

For Mill, "liberty" expressed the capacity for improvement in individual
man and in collective mankind and exemplified the "permanent interests
of man as a progressive being."38 While manifest in freedom of thought,
speech, individual autonomy, and the right to education and
self-development, Mill was more concerned to define liberty as "Civil or
Social liberty," or the principle that determines "the nature and limits
of power which can be legitimately exercised by society over the
individual."39 [By]{.underline} "[liberty]{.underline}," [Mill did not
mean the narrower ideas of individual right]{.underline} or free will,
[but]{.underline} rather "[[liberty]{.underline}" [was the overarching
principle that]{.underline}]{.mark} both [[defined political sovereignty
in liberal society]{.underline}, [and which authorized
**the**]{.underline}]{.mark} differentiated **[[power of government over
"backward" peoples]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Mill stated that "this
doctrine is meant to apply only to human beings in the maturity of their
faculties. We are not speaking of children. . . . We may leave out of
consideration those backward states of society in which the race itself
may be considered as its nonage."40 As the sovereign power over a
population to prepare them for self-government, "liberty" promised the
amelioration of human culture, society, and civilization, unfolding in
time. [Mill characterized this formative process of **socialization into
liberty** as]{.underline} "[the fitting adjustment between individual
independence and social control]{.underline}" [that leads
to]{.underline} **["the regulation of human conduct."]{.underline}**41
Like utilitarian thinkers Jeremy Bentham and Mill's father, James Mill,
who were concerned with the "governmental character" of liberalism, John
Stuart [[Mill]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[emphasized]{.mark} that
[liberal freedom included **discipline**]{.mark}]{.underline}.42 In
utilitarianism, additional freedoms necessarily required additional
control and regulation; in this sense, control was not a
counterprinciple to freedom; it was the condition from which it arises.
[Liberty depended on education and]{.underline} "[good
government]{.underline}" **[to cultivate subjects to judge and discern
beyond]{.underline}** the "yoke of **[opinion]{.underline}**."43 [In
this sense]{.underline}, "**[[education]{.underline}]{.mark}**," broadly
understood, **[[was the]{.underline}]{.mark}** synthetic **[[link
between individual subjectivity and the state]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
[Through the educative function of civil and social
institutions]{.underline}, law, culture, the workplace, and the state,
[citizen-subjects are formed not only for representative
government]{.underline}, **[but also for participation in liberal
society itself]{.underline}**.44

Mill did not limit his definition of "good government" to representative
government alone. Rather, "good government" was that which maintained
"Order and Progress," and could discern the form of ad- ministration
that would "preserve the peace," not only in Britain, but also
throughout the English-speaking Commonwealth, and in the Asian and
African colonies.45 Maintaining order and progress meant precisely
calibrating what form of government was appropriate "for England and
France," on the one hand, or "for Bedouins and Malays," on the other,
for discerning "the state of different communities, in point of culture
and development, \[ranging\] downwards to a condition very little above
the highest of the beasts."46 Thus, [[the concept of]{.underline}
"[government]{.underline}" [coincides with]{.underline}]{.mark}
[nineteenth-century [narratives of civilization that enforced **a
hierarchy of nations, races, and cultures**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [and a
linear development **from non-Western "primitive" to "civilized"
Europe**]{.underline}. [[It justified]{.underline}]{.mark}, in Mill's
writings, [**[the despotism of colonial rule]{.mark}** for those "unfit"
for representative government]{.underline}, as a means of bringing the
backward, violent, and undeveloped peoples of the non-European world
into the universal civilization of Europe. [Yet it is not simply that
Mill's thought merely accommodated colonial domination]{.underline};
rather [[his ideas **provided the terms**]{.underline},
**[logics]{.underline}**, **[and powers through which older colonial
domination was rationalized and new forms of imperial domination were
innovated and executed]{.underline}**]{.mark}. If we examine Mill's
Considerations of Representative Government (1861), in relationship to
his writings on the East India Company, we appreciate that he explained
"liberty" consistently through the division of those "incapable of
self-government" from those with the capacity for liberty.
[Representative Government begins and ends with explicit discussions of
the need for authoritarian government in colonial India as a means of
progress toward liberty and civilization]{.underline}

Colonization and the closing of futures [Scenario planning is meant to
be a dialectical quest for open futures, whereby alternative worlds are
envisioned and judgement as to the most desirable world is
suspended.]{.underline} Such a dialogical process, associated with
democratic [politics of world making, typically implies the critique,
negation and transcendence of the established power
constellation]{.underline}, which is by its very nature conservative.
Hence, [power holders are tempted to believe that their rule is
indefinite and that history has ended -- since all activities are
directed towards the maintenance of the current order]{.underline}.
Conversely, action, which 'has an inherent tendency to force open all
limitations and cut across all boundaries' is discouraged (Arendt 1958:
190). Hannah Arendt therefore went so far as claiming that 'action, seen
from the viewpoint of the automatic processes which seem to determine
the course of the world, looks like a miracle' (Arendt 1958: 246).
[Established power elites may have an interest in scenario planning, but
the future with which they are fascinated is the prolongation of their
current worlds. In other words, scenario planning is used for colonizing
the future. In a colonized 'scenario planning', predominant or currently
powerful stakeholders do not search for alternative futures, but,
instead, enact their own ideological discourses, imaginaries and frames.
The current power constellation is left unquestioned, and taken for
granted in the scenario planning, as if established power factions will
perdure in the future. The negation of wellestablished biases and
prejudices is held in check, in order to safeguard the status quo. Such
conservativism is legitimized by referring to current trends that are
endowed with the aura of necessity or inevitability]{.underline}
(natural and eternal laws). A colonized 'scenario planning' therefore
[masks unequal and often illegitimate power relationships.]{.underline}
Historically, it appears that [scenario planning has more often than not
been a tool for colonization, designed to secure the future rule of the
established power complex. In the 1940s, Herman Kahn and the RAND
Corporation developed scenario planning to enable US military rulers to
forecast the moves of potential opponents and to accordingly develop
counteroffensives in the nuclear arms race]{.underline} (Tevis 2010). In
the 1970s, Pierre Wack and [Royal Dutch/Shell established scenario
planning activities as an integral part of strategic management, to
secure oil interests in the context of ecological crisis and the oil
crisis]{.underline} (Wack 1985; Chermack and Coons 2015). The stimulus
for scenario planning in these cases was the perceived rise of
uncertainties in a world that had become more unpredictable and
potentially apocalyptic. Horror scenarios of nuclear wars and a Third
World War had become commonplace in the 1950s. Stories of ecological
catastrophe, with a vision of large tracts of the earth rendered
uninhabitable, the collapse of global food production, the acidification
of the oceans, sea-level rise and storms, and droughts of growing
intensity, became common since the publication of the Club of Rome
report in 1972 (Wright et al 2013). In the hands of ruling military,
governmental and corporate powers, ['scenario planning' became a method
for ensuring strategic victory in a context of uncertainties and
complexities. Since such scenario planning aimed at predictability,
ambiguities were undesirable factors that were better
eliminated]{.underline}, both in theory and practice (Amer, Daim and
Jetter 2013). [Computer simulations, game theoretic tools, forecasting
methods, trend research, horizon scanning, and visual imageries filtered
out all that which could not be mapped]{.underline} (O'Brien 2016).
Pierre Wack, who introduced scenario planning at Royal Dutch/Shell,
emphasizes that the future is only half closed. He made a plea for the
incorporation of both literary and technical methods in scenario
planning, to facilitate both the imagination and calculation of probable
futures (Chermack and Coons 2015). According to Wack, the future is
partly determined by trends that cannot but persist (Van't Klooster and
Van Asselt 2006). Population growth and ageing are examples of such
trends; and the corresponding implications for food demand, transport,
housing, and other kinds of infrastructure clearly have to be reckoned
with in any scenario planning. At the same time, for Wack, the future
cannot be fully outlined based on these data and graphics. The partial
openness of the future lies in the unpredictability of future
generations' actions in reaction to these trends. Robotic warfare is one
possible future; large-scale euthanasia is another. But it is also
imaginable that ecological disasters may wipe off entire populations.
These futures are imaginable and yet not simply fictive because the
'material' for their 'creation' is already available here and now. For
instance, it is highly probable that white Americans will no longer be
the majority population in the United States by 2050, but the question
as to how white Americans will cope with living as a minority in the US
invites different answers (Martín Alcoff 2015: 24; 26). [Colonization
aims at ruling out openness, with the aim of shaping a future
(preferably one that seems to be the product of predetermined trends
that cannot be altered by human decisions) in which the current status
quo is preserved]{.underline}. O'Brien (2016) explains that Royal
Dutch/Shell's interest in [scenario planning is motivated by its will to
shape a future in which remains a dominant key actor that moulds the
world in its own interest: its scenario planning practices and its wish
to maintain its hegemony are interconnected. ']{.underline}Shell's
scenario plans,' O'Brien (2016: 334) notes, 'are credited with the
company's success in outwitting the thugs, and thereby contributing to
the larger project of securing Western interests amidst the turmoil of
globalization.' [Such a hegemonic project has its prices in terms of
human rights abuses, oil pollution and corporate crimes (Holzer 2007;
Hennchen 2015).]{.underline} The organized fossilfuel industry is
powerful enough to protect its vested interests and to promote a
strategy of inaction (no reduction of fossil-fuel emissions), so that
nothing really changes. Michael Mann, a leading climate scientist,
explains that to safeguard the current status quo, the fossil-fuel
industry, including Royal Dutch/Shell, funds a 'climate change denial
campaign' to discredit climate science -- which advocates radical change
now -- and prevent dialogues. In this campaign, a significant part of
the established power elites, including the Koch Brothers, and
influential politicians like John McCain and Joe Lieberman, makes a
mockery of climatology, and of particular scientists (Wright and Mann
2013). [The pertinent question that ought to be raised,]{.underline}
O'Brien (2016: 341) therefore [concludes is: 'whose future is being
planned, by whom, for whom and to what ultimate end?' When scenario
planning is a tool for colonization, the future is planned by and for
the established power constellation, even if 'larger' entities such as
national, European or Western interests are invoked. Such scenario
planning is legitimized by discrediting 'doom scenarios', through
discourses on the liberating potential of technology]{.underline} (which
should be able to solve the problems that it creates) [and
(correspondingly) on the inevitable course of history.]{.underline}

[Within the IR literature **[there is a perennial admonition to make
theory more 'relevant' to policy makers]{.mark}**]{.underline}, but
[this is usually cast in problem‐solving terms]{.underline}: [[producing
knowledge that solves the problems faced by the existing political
framework]{.underline}]{.mark}. (Lepgold, 1998; Eriksson and Sundelius,
2005; Walt, 2005). Many of [those engaged in critical theorizing
**resist** such demands to be 'useful,' suspicious of the
operationalization of academic work in oppressive systems, and tend
towards a position of 'resistance' to the system as a
whole]{.underline}. Critical security studies scholar Anna
[Stavrianakis]{.underline} (2012, p. 233) for example, [calls on
disarmament activists to demand 'transgressive change that fundamentally
alters the social landscape as well as generates concrete improvements'
rather than calling for 'incremental changes that leave the parameters
of an issue untouched]{.underline}'. **[Given the centrality of
discourse to critical theorizing, resistance is often framed not in
terms of taking territory, mobilizing bodies, changing legislation,
gaining votes or raising money.]{.underline}** Rather [it tends to focus
on the critical deconstruction of oppressive discourse and disruption of
existing norms]{.underline} (e.g. Hargreaves, 2012). As a result, many
critical IR scholars see their academic work -- undermining dominant
discourses through their scholarship and teaching -- as their primary
form of resistance. (Said, 1996). [An emerging generation of political
actors]{.underline} were educated by post‐positivist and critical IR
scholars and conceive of their work self‐consciously in discursive
terms. That is, they [frame their intervention in the political arena as
a deliberate attempt to reshape the way society speaks about and gives
meaning to a particular phenomenon]{.underline}, people, group or
activity. [Occupy Wall Stree]{.underline}t activists drew upon critical
and discursive theories to strategize their symbolic disruption of the
neo‐liberal order (Welty, 2013). [LGBTQA activists and 'third wave'
feminists]{.underline} are trying to change dominant discourses of
gender and sexuality (e.g. St. Pierre, 2000). However, critical theory
has had less impact on the realm of international military and security
policy, which remains heavily influenced by realist thought (Cooper,
2006). As critical theorizing has begun to be used for solving definable
political problems (e.g. Davies, 2012; Merlingen, 2013), what Brown
(2013) calls '[critical problem‐solving theory', it has
eroded]{.underline} Cox\'s (1981) [boundary between 'problem‐solving'
and critical theories]{.underline}. **[What happens when a theoretical
paradigm that explicitly defines itself in critical opposition is
instrumentalized and used in problem‐solving ways?]{.underline}** This
question, which we begin to explore in this article, is underexamined in
the literature (see Weizman, 2012, pp. 185--220 for an important
exception). According to the epistemic community literature (e.g. Haas
2004), the education of policy makers can shape their later actions
(Eriksson and Sundelius, 2005). Most usefully for this article, it shows
how at critical junctures policy makers will turn to experts. [Policy
makers tend to be less interested in meta‐theory or broad academic
debates about an issue]{.underline}. Rather, [they look for knowledge
that can be used instrumentally to solve a particular policy
problem]{.underline} (e.g. Hall, 1993). But **[[moving theoretical ideas
from academia]{.mark}, [through the activist community, to the policy
arena]{.mark}, [dilutes]{.mark} the original ideas [and reinterprets
them in instrumental ways]{.mark}]{.underline}**. To help understand
this, we draw on postcolonial concepts of 'translation' and
'creolization' of different 'knowledge systems' pushed into contact
(Shih and Lionet, 2011, p. 30). We find that some ICAN
[[campaigners]{.underline}]{.mark} responsible for its current strategy
[[have 'translated' IR discursive theory into the world of
**disarmament** policy making]{.underline}]{.mark}. In doing so, [[they
selected the aspects of critical security studies 'to transpose and
emphasize]{.underline}]{.mark}' (cf. Tymoczko, 2000 p. 24) [[as befit
their specific political goals]{.underline}]{.mark}. [**[This]{.mark}**
creative application of critical theory in a new setting, in its
**[translation of theory into political engagement,]{.mark}**
[may]{.mark} [**necessarily** involve rendering it **less threatening**

[The practice of debating both sides]{.underline} does not [warrant
support]{.underline} simply because it is ethical; it does so [because
it is an effective pedagogical technique for inculcating the
communicative ethics necessary for democratic citizenship. According to
Day, 'Debating both sides teaches students to discover, analyze, and
test all the arguments, opinions, and evidence relevant to a decision.
In addition, it provides an opportunity for students to substantiate for
themselves the assumption that ''truthful'' positions may be taken on
both sides of controversial questions' (]{.underline}1966, p. 13). In
response to the critics of switch-side debating, who claimed that a
process of inquiry and discussion could reap these benefits of an
'enlarged mentality' without requiring students to speak out against
their convictions, [Day claimed that it is only through the publication
of others' views / by virtue of speech / that the habits of mind
necessary to attend equally and impartially to all sides of a
controversy are formed.]{.underline} In other words, by debating both
sides of a question, [by giving a forceful presentation of views that
contradict her or his commitments, the student learns how to convert her
or his personal convictions into a conviction for the political morality
of debate itself. By learning how to abstract from her or his particular
viewpoint, a skill necessitated by the demands of debating both sides,
the student is made amenable to the democratic authority of debate and
the norm of full and free expression.]{.underline}9 In this way, [debate
emerges as a way of knowing how to embody a general norm that,
ironically, disguises how the norm emerges from the particular histories
and interests of the body (race, nation, gender, class) that
speaks.]{.underline} Cold war liberalism and free speech In the hands of
Dennis Day, [the goal of debate was to reassign the convictions of
students to the process of debate as a democratic form of
decision-making.]{.underline} In this way debate training was no longer
simply a mechanism for developing critical thinking or advocacy skills,
but instead, [debate was now a performance technique that made possible
the self-fashioning of a new form of liberal citizen. The citizen's
commitments were to be redirected to the process of debate. This
redirection entails a procedural notion of liberal citizenship that asks
the student to invest in debate as a method of
deliberation]{.underline}. Our argument here rests on [Day's attempt to
ethically defend debating both sides by linking the pedagogical
rationale of debate to a public ethic, in this case, full and free
expression]{.underline}. We are not claiming that debate actually
creates a situation in which students who participate in the activity
abandon their convictions and commitments on the issues of the day nor
are we claiming that debate asks students to embrace an ungrounded
relativism. For us, what is important here is that [when faced with an
ethical criticism of debating both sides]{.underline}, Day sets out [a
deliberative-oriented vision of democracy whereby the liberal citizen
materializes by divorcing his/her speech from the sincerity principle.
To embody one's commitment to the democratic norm of free and full
expression required students to argumentatively perform positions they
might personally oppose in order to instantiate the circulation of free
and full expression and to secure a commitment toward debate as a
democratic form of decision-making.]{.underline} Thus, [the debate over
debate was a struggle over the ethical attributes required for liberal
citizenship.]{.underline} The argument that we will develop in this
section begins with the premise that a key element of Cold War
liberalism was [the attempt to re-position the United States as the
leader of the Free World (]{.underline}Greene 1999). One way Cold War
liberalism made possible the emergence of US world leadership was by
pulling together a national and international commitment to 'American
exceptionalism'. According to Nikhil Pal Singh (1998), American
exceptionalism is a product of the attempt to conceptualize the United
States as a concrete representative of the universal norms of democracy.
In so doing, the US is granted a status and history that is deemed
unique from other nations at the same time as that uniqueness qualifies
the US to be the leader and judge of democratic attributes,
characteristics and norms. In the aftermath of World War II, the
proliferation of free speech as a characteristic of the US helped to
warrant Cold War liberal claims to American exceptionalism. As Paul
Passavant (1996) suggests, the 'Millian paradigm' of free speech has
been appropriated by U.S. constitutional theorists to grant 'America'
the status of a nation whereby 'one legitimately claims the right to
free speech' (pp. 301/2). For Passavant, the process by which the US
emerged as a nation whereby citizens claim the right to free speech
creates a moral geography in which other nations are not granted the
'maturity' necessary for free speech and/or simultaneously must conform
to the U.S. vision of free speech. It is our argument that during the
cold war, [the debate-free speech assemblage helped to make possible the
emergence of 'America's' status as an exemplar of
democracy.]{.underline} The Cold War supported two reasons not to
debate, or at least participate in affirming the 'Red China' resolution.
First, the military academies maintained that they could not argue
against established US foreign policy, in particular while donning a
military uniform, without committing what Habermas (1979a) calls a
'performative contradiction'. Moreover, they feared that a cadet arguing
for diplomatic recognition of Communist China would send a message of
indecisiveness, division, and weakness to the nation's international
enemies (Burns 1954, p. 12). Furthermore, given the on-going hearings to
expose communist infiltration in the Army, one might legitimately fear
that he might not be granted the privilege to suspend the sincerity
principle nor to abstract from the particularity of the uniform he might
be wearing at the time of the debate. Second, the teacher colleges of
Nebraska, as well as many editorialists, claimed that by defending
diplomatic recognition of 'Red China', students would fall victim to
Communist propaganda (Baird 1955, p. 6) Impressionable students, critics
feared, would not have the cognitive skills or experience to recognize
propaganda and would, thus, be susceptible to indoctrination and
brainwashing. As hysterical as this argument sounds / and it certainly
was a product of the anti-Communist hysteria wrought by McCarthyism / it
was not without academic support. A hallmark of the Cold War liberalism
of the late forties and fifties was the steadfast belief in / and fear
of / the seductive appeal of totalitarianism for American youth. In
1949, in his Cold War liberal manifesto The Vital Center, the
influential historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr, argued that the lack of
political commitment and moral conviction among the US citizenry, in
particular American youth, posed a considerable threat to the continued
existence of democracy. Schlesinger (1949) and other Cold War liberals
(and conservatives) feared that an alienated youth was especially
vulnerable to the promises of certitude and solidarity contained in
Communist propaganda. Communism held a genuine appeal for those stricken
with anxiety because it offered both new social forms and a new social
creed. US political culture, in contrast, was simply too thin to provide
a defense against the persistent neuroses of postindustrial modernity
and, therefore, was in grave danger of Communist infiltration. Because
'\[t\] here is a Hitler and Stalin in the breast of every man \[sic\]',
Schlesinger proclaimed, the fate of free society hinged upon the
prospects for cultivating a youth dedicated to keeping constant vigil
over the strength of their own and their fellow citizens convictions (p.
250). Concurrently, the Army Information and Education Group, which
would become the core of the Hovland-Yale Communication and Persuasion
Group, led by Carl Hovland, was conducting experiments testing the
relationship between inducement and internalized attitude change. In
1953, Hovland, Janis, and Kelley published their highly influential book
Communication and Persuasion, which established a positive relation
between verbalization and the intensification of belief and predicted
that being forced to overtly defend a position discrepant from one's own
private beliefs would result in the internalization of the overtly
defended position.10 This prediction was further supported by the
forced-compliance and cognitive dissonance studies of Festinger (1957)
and his colleagues at Stanford. For decades, the ability to understand
the merits of opposing arguments had been championed as one of the prime
pedagogical benefits of intercollegiate debate training. However, in the
fall of 1954, Hovland's and Festinger's studies coupled with the
antiCommunist rhetoric of Schlesinger, which would, much to
Schlesinger's dismay, come to underwrite McCarthy's witch hunts, would
be articulated in such a way that debate's ability to train students to
take the other's perspective might be framed as a threat to national
security. The fear that defending the diplomatic recognition of 'Red
China' would turn American youth into Communist sympathizers saturated
the debating both sides controversy with an anxiety over the virility of
'democratic faith'.11 Those choosing to defend the virtues of
intercollegiate debate and the practice of debating both sides were
careful not to question the basic tenets of the antiCommunism that
constituted the ideological core of Cold War liberalism. Democracy, if
it were to survive the seductive appeal of totalitarianism, had to
become a fighting faith, a faith born out of and tested in social and
political conflict. Debate, in particular the format of debating both
sides of controversial issues embodied the sort of political conflict
that could engender sound conviction, rational decisions, and a
committed youth impervious to Communist propaganda.12 Moreover, debate
provided the antidote to communist propaganda. Baird concluded,
'\[c\]ollege debate teams are the last groups in this nation where
Communist propaganda has any chance of making headway' (1955, p. 7). No
student wishing to win the debate, Burns argued, 'would take the
affirmative on the grounds that we must love the Chinese or that they
are merely agrarian radicals' (p. 7). Burns, so confident in the
antiCommunist sentiment of the majority of students, contended that no
student would dare argue in favour of Communism but 'pitch his \[sic\]
case on the argument that recognition might help pull China out of the
Moscow orbit, that it might help build a firmer anti-Communist alliance,
that it might make peaceful coexistence possible. He \[sic\] would, in
short, be directing our attention to the very questions that all
American's might well be debating' (p. 7). For Schlesinger, however, the
ground of the anti-Communist consensus Baird believed to be evident in
'the majority of students' was unstable. Schlesinger performed a
delicate balancing act in The Vital Center, disavowing the 'guilt by
association' reasoning of the House Un-American Activities Committee
while advocating that the Communist Party represented a 'clear and
present danger' to the national security of the United States. One way
to create the necessary faith in democracy was, for Schlesinger, to
defend free expression as a democratic norm worth fighting for because
'free discussion \[is the\] climate \... democracy requires for
responsible decision' (1949, p. 203). For Schlesinger, the democratic
faith necessitated full and free discussion, a fundamental civil liberty
that provided, in his words, a 'technique of freedom' (p. 189). It was
'the climate of freedom' preserved by the democratic method of free
speech that authorized his 'conviction that a free people will never
vote for totalitarianism' (p. 199). Nikhil Pal Singh (1998) argues that
to understand the stark opposition between liberal democracy and
totalitarianism permeating Cold War discourse requires an appreciation
of how the US asserted its moral claim to be the 'leader of the free
world'. Of particular importance in this process was, according to
Singh, 'the widely held argument that the United States is the world's
exemplary nation-state, already the bearer of universality within
itself' (p. 490). The discourse of American exceptionalism is advanced
in and through this description of the US as the concrete representative
of the universal norms of democracy. Singh supports his claim and
discusses its implications by focusing on the historical intersection
between the Cold War and Jim Crow. To defend the United States as the
exemplar of universality required the fight against Jim Crow in order to
better project Cold War liberalism's moral claim to world leadership in
the battle with Communism. From this perspective, the fight against Jim
Crow, as Manning Marable (1984) argues, was inextricably linked to the
global requirements of US world power. For Singh, Marable's insight
becomes the starting point for supporting his claim that Cold War
liberalism's promotion of democratic norms both domestically and
globally was held together by the construction of 'America' as the
container and advocate of universal democratic norms. This concept of
American exceptionalism was made possible by the transformation of the
United States into the 'concrete universal' embodiment of democracy.
Singh's reading of how civil rights worked to promote American
exceptionalism suggests a model for thinking about the the norm of free
speech during the Cold War. For Schlesinger, civil liberties and civil
rights emerged as the two techniques of freedom. Schlesinger writes 'in
the world under the shadow of the police state, we only strengthen our
claim to moral leadership by creating here an environment for free and
responsible discussion' (1949, p. 218). It is Schlesinger's ability to
use the domestic need of free speech in the United States as a moral
claim to world leadership that gives the United States the ability to
embrace a faith in its role as the telos and exemplar of democracy.
Singh's revisionist history and Schlesinger's Cold War liberal advocacy
of free speech suggest that we consider the debating both sides
controversy during the 1950s and 1960s beyond its parochial frame as
debate pedagogy and, instead, as a full-fledged element in a complex
transformation in liberal citizenship necessitated by the emergence of
the US as a global super power. In Baird's hands, the interaction
between the Cold War and debating both sides offers a close
correspondence between the function of rhetorical education and the
needs of Cold War liberalism to generate an antiCommunist consensus. It
does so in two ways: First, it gives students the reasoning skills
necessary to make the shadowy propaganda of Communism transparent.
Second, due to the competitive character of the activity, students are
not likely to argue for Communism, and, therefore, they are not opening
themselves up to the risks of being captured by its dangerous
seductions. Ten years later, Day (1966) would argue that 'the ethics of
democratic debate do not allow for a pre-judgment of the reasonableness
of discourse' (p. 12) and he demonstrated a deep faith in the power of
debate to serve as a means of democratic decision making by promoting
speech against the grain of the reigning consensus. Day expressed a more
radical possibility of debate and argument as providing the ethical
resources for rooting out error, generating consensus, and providing a
universal norm of democracy. Day also demonstrated his commitment to
free speech more radically than Schlesinger by abandoning Schlesinger's
deployment of 'clear and present danger' as an external value to
regulate the reasonableness of speech. Yet, Day's defence of debating
both sides elides the national particularity of how free speech was
being put to work in the global struggle between liberal democracy and
totalitarianism. One way that Cold War liberalism helped to transform
the national particularity of the United States into a universal form of
liberalism was through the constitution of free speech as a democratic
norm. [As a cultural technology debating both sides contributed to
American exceptionalism by transforming students into the concrete
embodied performers of the universal norms of free speech. In other
words, by instantiating a desire for full and free expression, the
pedagogical technique of debating both sides became a mechanism by which
the student-debater-citizen becomes an exceptional 'American' / the
bearer of universal norms of liberal democracy.]{.underline}

Other literary figures of the twentieth century, including Ralph
Ellison, exposed the limitations, dangers, and erasures of
forward-marching schemes. In his celebrated novel Invisible Man,
[Ellison offers a kind of parody of Hegelian and Marxist-inspired
conceptions of time and history. The Brotherhood, an interracial,
liberationist group that the protagonist joins and later clashes with in
the novel, tends to view the past and present in a narrowly instrumental
way. According to this organization, past events, struggles, and losses
are only significant insofar as they contribute to and help fulfill the
goal of human liberation. Those individuals, strivings, and memories
that are not immediately relevant to this liberated future, or that
Introduction 11 present an obstacle to a unified, harmonious future, are
"plunged outside of history."]{.underline} While Ellison insists that
the Brotherhood does not represent Marxism per se, [some of the
qualities associated with the fictional organization remind us of the
dangers of Marxism and Marxist interpretations of history and human
experience.]{.underline} Recall that Marx, Hegel's dissident disciple,
is very aware of the ambivalences at the center of modern life. While
Marx occasionally lauds capitalism for the new, valuable things and
ideas that it brings into the world---novel forms of communication,
travel, commerce, knowledge---he claims that advancements in these areas
depend on the global exploitation of workers, the unequal distribution
of wealth, and the objectification of human relationships.22 Although
Marx is primarily concerned with class struggle, he is aware that class
and race domination are intertwined. The wealth that European
capitalists have been able to accumulate, on Marx's reading, is made
possible by the exploitation and enslavement of Africans, Asians, and
Native Americans as well as the usurpation of indigenous lands.23 The
"rosy dawn of the era of capitalist production" contains a dark
underside; progress is a turbulent movement.24 [Even though Marx
acknowledges the ambivalence of progress, he remains committed to the
idea that history moves, through struggle and conflict, toward a better
and more humane future. Capitalism is a penultimate historical stage, a
stage that anticipates and enables the workers' revolution and the
gradual creation of a classless society, the telos of
history]{.underline}. Marx envisions a future society no longer beset by
exploitation, inequality, and division. Although this seems on the
surface to be a laudable vision, Marx's forward-directed proposal
contains notable problems and flaws. [The belief that history moves
toward one goal trivializes the presence of multiple and conflicting
aims, desires, meanings, pasts, and comprehensive visions within our
world. This denial of plurality has pernicious consequences. As the
legacy of communist regimes demonstrates, the imposition of a universal
telos]{.underline} (by the so-called vanguards of history) [onto local
contexts and communities is a violent process, a process that
sacrifices]{.underline}---for the sake of a unified and liberated
future---[those bodies, cultures, and groups that "lag behind" and
resist the movement of history]{.underline}.25 Therefore Marx's proposal
runs into some of the same problems that Hegel's account of history
does. In addition, because [Marx privileges class identity and the labor
struggle, other kinds of struggles---around race and gender, for
instance---are either rendered insignificant or seen as ancillary to
class conflict.]{.underline} In chapter 3, I discuss how Ellison
challenges Marxist conceptions of time and history by offering a
jazz-inspired notion of time and by demonstrating the playful,
tension-filled relationship between the past and present.

### 2AC \-- Root Cause

#### Racism is the root cause of domination; capitalism stemmed from it.

[[With each historical moment,]{.mark} however, [the rationale
and ]{.mark}cultural [mechanisms of domination became more transparent.
Race was its epistemology, ]{.mark}its [ordering
principle, ]{.mark}its [organizing structure, ]{.mark}its [moral

the soul is not present at all in the slave; in a female it is present
but ineffective]{.underline}\" \[Politics, i26oaiz\]), non-Greeks, and
all laborers (slaves, artisans, farmers, wage workers, etc.: \"\[Tlhe
mass of mankind are evidently quite slavish in their tastes, preferring
a life suitable to beasts\" \[Nicomachean Ethics,

construct. And from the twelfth century ]{.mark}on, [one European ruling
order after another]{.mark}, one cohort of clerical or secular
propagandists following another, [reiterated]{.mark} and
embellished [this racial calculus. As the
Black]{.mark} Radical [Tradition was distilled]{.mark} from the racial
antagonisms which were arrayed along a continuum from the casual insult
to the most ruthless and lethal rules of law; from the objectifications
of entries in marine cargo manifests, auction accountancy, plantation
records, broadsheets and newspapers; from the loftiness of Christian
pulpits and biblical exegesis to the minutia of slave-naming, dress,
types of food, and a legion of other
significations, [the]{.mark} terrible [culture of race was
revealed]{.mark}. Inevitably, [the tradition was transformed into
a ]{.mark}radical force. And in its most [militant
manifestation]{.mark}, no longer accustomed to the resolution that
flight and withdrawal were sufficient, [the purpose of the struggles
informed by the tradition became the overthrow of the whole race-based

#### Racism is the root cause of capitalism, and violence. History proves that the White states always wanted to dominate black people and since they could never be finished they constructed capitalistic hierarchies.

The functions of these latter ideological constructions were related but
different. Race was largely the rationalization for the domination,
exploitation, and/or extermination of non-\"Europeans\" (including Slavs
and Jews). And we shall have occasion in Part 2 to explore its
applications beyond Europe and particularly to African peoples more
closely. But while we remain on European soil, it is Herrenvolkthat
matters. In eighteenth-century England, Reginald Horsman sees its
beginnings in the \"mythical\" Anglo-Saxonism that was flown as an
ideological pennant by the Whig intelligentsia in France (for example,
Paul de Rapin-Thoyras and Montesquieu, and before them Franqois Hotman
and Count Henri de Boulainvilliers), in Germany (Herder, Fichte,
Schleiermacher, and Hegel), in north America (John Adams and Thomas
Jefferson),  ideologists displayed the idea of the heroic Germanic race.
And the idea swept through nineteenth-century Europe, gathering momentum
and artifice through such effects as Sir Walter Scott\'s historical
novels and Friedrich von Schlegel\'s philological fables. Inevitably, of
course, the idea was dressed in the accoutrement of nineteenth-century
European science. "Not satisfied with merely proclaiming the superiority
of the white over the coloured race, also felt it necessary to erect a
hierarchy within the white race itself."

#### Imperialism is the [highest stage of capitalism]{.underline} --- NATO's an organization [built]{.underline} for sustaining [monopoly capitalism]{.underline}, a process that [endlessly expands]{.underline} and [divides]{.underline} territory for the [market expansion]{.underline}.

The New Monopoly of the International Oligarchic Alliance

Lenin stated in Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism that "the
epoch of the latest stage of capitalism shows us that [certain
[relations]{.mark} between capitalist associations **grow up**, [based
on]{.mark} the **[economic division]{.mark} of the world**]{.underline};
while parallel to and in connection with it, [certain relations grow up
[between **political alliances**]{.mark}]{.underline}, between states,
[[on the basis of]{.mark} the **territorial [division]{.mark}** of the
world]{.underline}, of the struggle for colonies, [[of]{.mark} the
"**[struggle for s]{.mark}pheres [o]{.mark}f
[i]{.mark}nfluence**."]{.underline}31 Finance capital and its foreign
policy, which is the struggle of the great powers for the economic and
political division of the world, give rise to a number of transitional
forms of state dependence. Two main groups of countries---those owning
colonies and colonies themselves---are typical of this epoch, as are the
diverse forms of dependent countries that, politically, are formally
independent, but in fact are enmeshed in the net of financial and
diplomatic dependence.32 Nowadays, [[neoimperialism]{.mark} has
[formed]{.mark} **new [alliances]{.mark}**]{.underline} [and **hegemonic
relations**]{.underline} in the economic, political, cultural, and
military fields.

Within the context of the new monopoly of the international oligarchs,
[the]{.underline} fourth [characteristic of neoimperialism is the
[formation of a]{.mark}n **international [monopoly]{.mark} capitalist
[alliance]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[between **one hegemon**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline}]{.mark} [several other **[great
powers]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [An economic foundation consisting of
**money politics**, **vulgar culture**, and **military** threats has
been formed for them to exploit and oppress via monopoly both at **home
and abroad**.]{.underline}

The G7 as the Mainstay of the Imperial Capitalist Core

Neoimperialism's current international monopoly economic alliance and
the framework of global economic governance are both dominated by the
United States. The G6 group was formed in 1975 by six leading industrial
countries, the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, France, Japan,
and Italy, and became G7 when Canada joined the following year. G7 and
its monopoly organizations are the coordination platforms, while the
International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, and the World Trade
Organization are the functional bodies. The global order of economic
governance that was set up under the Bretton Woods system after the
Second World War is essentially a high-level international capitalist
monopoly alliance manipulated by the United States to serve its
strategic economic and political interests. In the early 1970s, the U.S.
dollar was decoupled from gold and the Bretton Woods currency system
collapsed. One after another, summits of the G7 countries then
shouldered responsibility for strengthening the Western consensus,
contending against the socialist countries of the East, and boycotting
the demands made by the less developed countries of the South for
reforms to the international economic and political order.33 Since
neoliberalism became the set of concepts dominating global economic
governance, these multilateral institutions and platforms have become
the driving force for the expansion of neoliberalism throughout the
world. In line with the wishes of the international financial monopoly
oligarchy and its allies, these bodies spare no effort to induce the
developing countries to implement financial liberalization, the
privatization of production factors, marketization without prior
supervision, and free exchange in capital projects so as to facilitate
inward and outward flows of international "hot money." These
institutions are constantly ready to control and plunder the economies
of developing countries, extracting huge profits by encouraging
speculation and creating financial bubbles. As Zbigniew Brzezinski
stated in The Grand Chessboard, "the International Monetary Fund and the
World Bank can be said to represent 'global' interests, and their
constituency may be construed as the world. In reality, however, they
are heavily American dominated."34

Since the 1980s, the IMF and World Bank have lured developing countries
to implement neoliberal reforms. When these countries have fallen into
crisis because of privatization and financial liberalization, the IMF
and other institutions have forced them to accept the Washington
Consensus by adding various unreasonable conditions to loans provided
earlier. The effect is to further intensify the impacts of neoliberal
reform. Between 1978 and 1992, more than seventy developing countries or
former socialist countries implemented a total of 566 structural
adjustment programs imposed by the IMF and the World Bank.35 In the
early 1980s, for example, the IMF used the Latin American debt crisis to
force Latin American countries to accept neoliberal "reforms." In order
to curb inflation, the U.S. Federal Reserve in 1979 pushed short-term
interest rates up from 10 percent to 15 percent, and finally to more
than 20 percent. Because the existing debt of the developing countries
was linked to U.S. interest rates, every 1 percent rise in U.S. interest
rates would result in developing-world debtor countries paying an
additional \$40 to 50 billion per year in interest. In the second half
of 1981, Latin America was borrowing at the rate of \$1 billion a week,
mostly in order to pay the interest on existing debt. During 1983,
interest payments consumed almost half of Latin American export
earnings.36 Under pressure to repay their loans, Latin American
countries were forced to accept neoliberal reform plans initiated by the
IMF. The main content of these plans consisted of privatizing
state-owned enterprises; liberalizing trade finance; implementing
economic austerity policies, with the effect of reducing living
standards; cutting the taxes on monopoly enterprises; and reducing
government spending on social infrastructure. During the 1997 Asian
financial crisis, the IMF attached numerous conditions to assistance
provided to South Korea, including that the allowance for foreign
shareholdings be relaxed from 23 percent to 50 percent, and then to 55
percent by December 1998. Moreover, South Korea was required to allow
foreign banks to set up branches freely.37

NATO and the International Monopoly-Capitalist Military and Political
Alliance

Established in the early days of the Cold War, the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization ([[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}) [is an international military
alliance for the defense of **monopoly capitalism**. It is led by the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and [involves
**other**]{.mark} **imperialist [countries]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
During the Cold War, [NATO]{.underline} was the main tool used by the
United States to [actively contain and counter **the Soviet Union and
the countries of Eastern Europe**,]{.underline} as well as to influence
and control the Western European countries. At the end of the Cold War,
the [[Warsaw]{.mark} Treaty Organization was **[dissolved]{.mark}** and
[NATO became the]{.mark} **military [organization]{.mark}** [through
which the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates sought to [achieve
its]{.mark} strategic [goals on a **global level**. A]{.mark}
**capitalist military [oligopoly]{.mark}**, involving one hegemon and
several other great powers, had **[come into
being]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Former U.S. secretary of state Warren
Christopher stated: "Only the United States can act as a leader.... [For
the United States to exercise leadership requires us to own a **credible
force threat** as a **backup for diplomacy**]{.underline}."38 The
National Security Strategy for the New Century, published in the United
States in December 1998, claimed unambiguously that the goal of the
United States was to "lead the entire world" and that no challenge to
its leadership, from any country or group of countries, would ever be
allowed to come into being.39 On December 4, 2018, U.S. secretary of
state Mike Pompeo declared in a speech to the Marshall Fund in Brussels:
"[The United States has not given up its global leadership]{.underline}.
It reshaped the order after WWII based on sovereignty but not the
multilateral system.... Under President Trump's leadership, we will not
give up international leadership or our allies in the international
system.... Trump is recovering America's traditional status as the world
center and leadership.... The United States wants to lead the world, now
and always."40

[To achieve leadership and **domination**]{.underline} over the world,
[the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [has made **every effort
to promote NATO's eastward expansion**]{.underline}, and has [expanded
its own sphere of influence to control Central and Eastern Europe and to
compress Russia's strategic space]{.underline}. Under the control of the
United States, [[NATO has become an **ideal**]{.mark} **military [tool
for U.S]{.mark}. global [interests]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In March
1999, a multinational NATO force led by the United States launched a
large-scale air attack on [Yugoslavia]{.underline}. It [was the first
time that NATO had launched a military strike]{.underline} against a
sovereign country during the fifty years since its foundation. In April
1999, NATO held a summit meeting in Washington, formally [adopting a
strategic concept]{.underline} that can be summarized under two points.
First, NATO was [permitted to conduct **collective military
intervention**]{.underline} outside its defense area in response to
"crimes and conflicts involving common interests." This effectively
[changed NATO from a "collective defense" military alliance into an
**offensive political and military organization**]{.underline} with the
so-called purpose of defending common interests and shared values.
Second, NATO's military actions did not require authorization from the
UN Security Council.41

In addition to NATO, U.S. military alliances formed on the basis of
bilateral treaties include pacts with Japan, South Korea, Australia, and
the Philippines. There are U.S. military bases on the territory of all
its military allies, and [these comprise a major part of the
**neoimperialist military alliance**. The U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [and]{.underline} its [[allies make]{.mark}
**military [threats]{.mark}**]{.underline} [and [carry out]{.mark}
**[provocations]{.mark} in many regions** of the world, [resulting
in]{.mark}]{.underline} many "[**hot [wars]{.mark}**," "warm wars,"
"cool wars," and "new cold wars," [intensifying]{.mark} the **new [arms
race]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The acts of ["**state terrorism**" carried
out by neoimperialism, and the double standard it applies to
counter-terrorism, have [caused]{.mark} other forms of **[terrorism to
multiply]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

This book attempts to address these limits by "rematerializing" the
relationship between liberalism and empire. The task involves
complementing an account of the semantic context of liberal ideas with
an analysis of the socioeconomic context, that is, paying as much
attention to the institutional structures and economic practices that
constituted the fabric of empire as to the political languages and
vocabularies in which liberal intellectuals articulated their assessment
of it. There are no doubt multiple ways of rematerializing the imperial
context (e.g., gender, ecology, technology, law, governance), each of
which would highlight a different aspect of empire's formative impact on
liberal thought. I propose [viewing the materiality of empire
specifically through the lens of "colonial capitalism," a notion
inspired by critical social theory and colonial political
economy]{.underline}. As an analytic framework, colonial capitalism
rests on the fundamental premise that [capitalism has historically
emerged within the juridico-political framework of the "colonial empire"
rather than the "nation-state."]{.underline} It [grasps capitalist
relations as having developed in and through colonial networks of
commodities, peoples, ideas, and practices, which formed a planetary web
of value chains connecting multiple and heterogeneous sites of
production across oceanic distances.]{.underline} A major corollary of
the colonial perspective on capitalism is to **[underscore the
constitutive role of extra-economic coercion in effecting capitalist
social transformations.]{.underline}** Within this picture, **[colonial
land grabs, plantation slavery, and the forced deindustrialization of
imperial dependencies configure as crucial moments in the global
formation of capitalism.]{.underline}**10 Borrowing a key concept from
Marx's account of the origins of capitalism, I employ the term [colonial
primitive accumulation to theorize the forcible transformation and
uneven integration of colonial land, labor, and resources into global
networks of capital]{.underline}.11 My focus falls on colonial sites,
not because [primitive accumulation]{.underline} did not also transpire
in Europe, but because it [played out much more brutally at the imperial
frontiers, called for different frameworks of justification, and
exercised liberal metropolitan minds with more vexing
questions.]{.underline} The principal contribution of this framework to
the study of liberalism is to highlight [the economic undertakings of
colonial entrepreneurs as a type of colonial anomaly that had to be
accounted for by the liberal standards of metropolitan
thought.]{.underline} The optic of colonial capitalism redefines
empire's challenge to liberalism by shifting the focus from who the
colonized are to what the colonizers do, that is, from the cultural
difference of the subject populations to the deeds of imperial agents
themselves. In charting a new map of the liberalism-empire nexus, I
mainly follow metropolitan reflections on territorial conquest,
indigenous dispossession, bonded labor, and armed trading, rather than
judgments about the rational capacity or civilizational status of the
non-Europeans. For sharpening the contours of this problem, the study
capitalizes on the peculiarity of the British imperial ideology.
Although the British matched and eventually surpassed their European
rivals in the capacity and readiness for imperial warfare, conquest, and
brutality, they stubbornly believed themselves to be, in David
Armitage's classic formulation, a "Protestant, commercial, maritime, and
free" people.12 The clash of this commercial, pacific, and free
self-image with the ruthless expropriation and despotic coercion of
colonial economies offers a window onto the tension between the liberal
conceptions of capitalism and its illiberal conditions of emergence and
possibility. Cognizant of the notoriously protean character of the term
"liberalism," I purposely restrict the investigation of liberalism to
its instantiations in metropolitan theories of capitalism rather than
taking on the entire range of family resemblances associated with the
term.13 I identify [the primal norms of contractual freedom and
juridical equality as the ideational core of the liberal conception of
capitalism.]{.underline} While [freedom and equality as normative
values]{.underline} are most commonly associated with liberal political
theory, they were also, and perhaps more [systematically, elaborated and
enshrined in the language of classical political economy.]{.underline}
Originating in the seventeenth century, political economy as a field of
knowledge evolved in tandem with global capitalism, and its
practitioners often proclaimed it to be the appropriate medium for
explaining the dynamics of commerce and capital, as well as for charting
an enlightened course of domestic and imperial policy.14 By
concentrating on political economy, this book therefore anchors core
tenets of liberalism in a sphere of reflection that adopted capitalist
social forms and their global variegation as its principle object of
inquiry. I dissect the entangled histories of liberalism, capitalism,
and empire around three critical moments of imperial expansion and
[controversy in which the theoretical parameters of liberalism were
articulated. The first of these is the seventeenth-century **colonial
land appropriation** in the Americas that enabled the formation of
Atlantic colonial capitalism and **ignited** momentous European debates
over legitimate **claims to property in the New World.** The second
moment centers on **the East India Company's ascendancy in Bengal and
British merchant capital's intrusion into the Indian economy**, which
triggered a public storm about **the nature of Anglo-Indian trade.** The
third and final moment concerns **nineteenth-century schemes of imperial
labor allocation** that aimed to promote colonial emigration and settler
capitalism in Australasia, which threw into question **the legal and
economic boundaries between free and bonded labor.**]{.underline}
"Property," "exchange," and "labor" thereby constitute a triadic
constellation at the core of liberal political economy's encounter with
colonial capitalism. [Extralegal appropriation of land in America,
militarized trading in India, and elaborate schemes of dependent labor
in Australasia each represents a vital moment in the development of
global capital networks and a challenge to narrating this development as
the triumph of private property, market exchange, and free
labor.]{.underline} Corresponding to the central questions of property,
exchange, and labor, I analyze the theoretical attempts of Locke, Burke,
and Wakefield to reconcile the essentially liberal image of Britain's
capitalist economy with the illiberal institutional arrangements and
practices on which it stood. My specific focus on these three
intellectuals stems from their simultaneous commitment to a modern
capitalist economy, to imperial expansion as an instrument of economic
prosperity and political power, and to the primal liberal norms of
contractual freedom and juridical equality. These multiple and often
incongruent theoretical commitments render their writings privileged
ground for detecting the frictions between liberalism, capitalism, and
empire and their negotiation in the register of political economy.
Compounding this rationale is the active involvement of the three
thinkers in Britain's imperial politics: Locke as Secretary to the
Council of Trade and Plantations and later a member of the Board of
Trade; Burke as a member of the Parliamentary Select Committee on India;
Wakefield as a pro-colonization publicist, lobbyist, and the
intellectual leader of the Colonial Reform Movement. Their shared
institutional and intellectual investments in the colonial capitalist
enterprise and the empire of liberty furnishes the overarching framework
within which a comparison of these otherwise dissimilar thinkers can
generate unexpected insights into the liaisons between liberalism and
empire. The following chapters demonstrate that when compared to the
twenty-firstcentury reclamations of British imperialism as the vanguard
of economic globalization, Locke, Burke, and Wakefield were ironically
less self-assured about the coercive interventions that went into making
Britain's imperial economy. Their disquiet about the illiberality of
empire was reflected in their strategies of "disavowal." Crucially, none
of them denied the fact of indigenous dispossession, unequal exchange,
and labor bondage that pervaded colonial economies. Instead of joining
contemporary critics in denouncing the imperial system, however, they
resorted to theoretical maneuvers, rhetorical strategies, fictions, and
myths that insulated the liberal image of Britain's commercial economy
from the enormities of colonial ventures. These theoretical innovations
include Locke's myth of mankind's "universal consent" to the use of
money, which ultimately blamed Native Americans for their own
expropriation; Burke's fantasy of "imperial commerce" that promised
equitable economic dealings between the British and their conquered
Indian subjects; and Wakefield's fictive "settler contract" whereby poor
colonial immigrants acceded to work as wage laborers rather than become
independent landowners. Such efforts at reconciliation also set these
three thinkers apart from other political economists, like Adam Smith
and David Hume, for whom the empire, particularly in its territorial and
extractive variety, was nigh irredeemable from a liberal economic
perspective. When the liberal British self-image traveled overseas, it
crashed against the violent shores of colonial capitalism. It fell to
the liberal intellectuals of the empire, such as the three examined
here, to brace the hull.

#### Imperialism and capitalism are symbiotic frames of analysis -- capitalist accumulation is not purely economic but rather shaped by the social forces of colonial expropriation.

Social historians of imperial and transoceanic connections have long
underscored the [historical symbiosis between imperialism and capitalist
expansion.]{.underline} Robin Blackburn, in his magisterial history of
the New World slavery, describes the seventeenth- and eighteenth-century
Atlantic as the stage of "pioneering capitalist industrialization."
[Commercial wars, territorial conquests, slave trade, and the union of
extra-economic coercion and export-oriented production in slave
plantations placed these activities "entirely within that sphere of
primitive accumulation about which Marx wrote . . . force as an economic
power."32 Turning from the West to the East Indies, we find an
aggressive form of what Jairus Banaji calls "company
capitalism."]{.underline} This species of mercantile capitalism,
prominent in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, combined
militarized trading by chartered companies in the Indian Ocean with
their forcible intrusion into the organization of agriculture and
manufacturing in South Asia, especially after the British military and
political ascendancy on the subcontinent.33 Cautioning against
overemphasizing commercial imperialism, the recent revival in the area
of settler colonial studies has alerted us to the [cascades of
displacement and depopulation that passed over North America and
Australasia in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, supplying the
"ghost acres" that proved essential to capitalist
expansion.]{.underline}34 Finally, Sven Beckert's recent reconstruction
of the Industrial Revolution weaves together [these strands of imperial
violence, planetary economic reorganization, and institutional
innovation into an account of a "war capitalism" that rampaged between
the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries]{.underline}. Although Beckert
rarely invokes Marx, his story of war capitalism is almost entirely
coextensive with Marx's story of primitive accumulation,35 above all in
its focus on [the "transformative powers of a union of capital and state
power" as the propulsive force behind "imperial expansion,
expropriation, and slavery \[that\] became central to forging a new
global economic order and eventually the rise of
capitalism]{.underline}."36 There are two reasons for adopting the
concept of primitive accumulation in the study of colonial capitalism
and liberalism. The first is [the pivotal role it assigns to
extra-economic coercion in the creation and maintenance of the
institutional background conditions of capitalism.3]{.underline}7 As a
number of theorists have recently pointed out, [capitalism is much more
than simply an economic system of production, circulation, and
consumption. It consists of an entire "institutionalized social order,"
a historically determinate mode of imagining, organizing, and practicing
human beings' relationship to one another and to the nonhuman world,
which encompasses social, ecological, and political dimensions at both
the macro-level of institutional-ideological complexes and the
micro-level of subjectivities.38]{.underline} That being said, [the
perceived autonomy of the "economic" relations institutionalized via
self-regulating markets is critical for the liberal imagination of
capitalism. As]{.underline} I will dwell on in more detail, [liberal
theories of capitalism normatively exclude nonmarket coercion from
economic dealings between legally free and equal property-owning
individuals, even as it consigns such coercion to the enforcement of
property rights and contracts.]{.underline} To this extent, capitalism
can be extolled as the economic system of freedom par excellence, an
identification that finds vernacular expression in the phrase "free
market economy" in today's parlance, and whose genealogy can be traced
at least back to Smith's idea of the "system of perfect liberty."39 By
contrast, Marx, in his discussion of primitive accumulation, stressed
that the creation of capitalist relations hinged on the employment of
"the power of the state, the concentrated and organized force of
society."40 Rosa Luxemburg expanded on this by observing [extra-economic
force to be a "permanent weapon" of capital at every moment of its
history]{.underline}, on the grounds that it "is an illusion to hope
that capitalism will ever be content with the means of production which
it can acquire by commodity exchange."41 The main vector of coercive
capitalist transformation, according to the MarxLuxemburg line, is
"expropriation," which sets the conditions of capitalist "exploitation"
by instituting capitalist private property, a dispossessed labor force,
and a market in productive inputs and wage goods. Expropriation in this
sense is not a simple transfer of resources or "stockpiling." It denotes
a structural transformation, or the "capitalization of social
reproduction," which makes laborers' access to conditions of labor and
means of subsistence contingent on producing a surplus that can be
privately appropriated and accumulated as capital.42 Nancy Fraser
captures this point well when she writes that the move "from the
frontstory of exploitation to the back-story of expropriation
constitutes a major epistemic shift" by directing our attention beyond
the market (sphere of circulation) and the workplace (sphere of
production) to the "political conditions of possibility of capitalism"
(sphere of institution).43 Chief [among these political conditions is
the role of public authority in suppressing the "resistance to the
expropriations through which capitalist property relations were
originated and sustained."]{.underline}44 This emphasis on the
constitutive violence of primitive accumulation is not intended to
displace or occlude other illiberal forms of power and force that are
internal to the general law of capitalist accumulation, the most
important of which is what Marx famously called the "despotism of the
workplace." Instead, one can fruitfully construe the despotism of the
workplace as resting on the institutionalized structural inequality and
unfreedom created by primitive accumulation. If the accumulation of
capital, as Marx argued, depends on the subjection of social
reproduction to the law of value---that is, the generalization of
commodity form and the domination of abstract labor in the satisfaction
of social needs---then the law of value itself presupposes, in Werner
Bonefeld's words, "the law of private property that primitive
accumulation established."45 It is important to note that abstract labor
and the law of value that it subtends are always already organized
through historically specific and varying forms instead of manifesting
themselves in a singular and uniform social configuration.46
Historically, [the entwinement of political power and capital
accumulation occasioned different property institutions, exchange
systems, and labor regimes in the imperial metropole and in the
colonies.]{.underline} In the former, institutionalized political power
assumed the form of an interventionist "fiscal-military state" that
secured capitalist private property, safeguarded returns to investment,
enforced contracts, and protected domestic industries from foreign
competition.47 Elsewhere, [it functioned as a "colonial state" that
upheld titles to expropriated land and enslaved labor, lent military and
financial support to chartered companies, reined in unruly subjects
overseas, and, of course, waged imperial wars against European and
non-European rivals.]{.underline}48 If one follows the thread that runs
through the Atlantic slave-plantation complex, the deindustrialization
and agrarianization of India, and the opening up of the Chinese markets,
one eventually arrives at the imperial state, whose sovereign power
circulated, grew, and ramified in an imperial constitution that
connected the metropole and its colonial officials to chartered
companies, trading factories, settler societies, and plantocracies.49
Secondly, the Marxian notion of primitive accumulation enables us to
conceive of [violent socioeconomic transformations in the colonies as
capitalist transformations]{.underline}, rather than developments that
are anomalous or incidental to the history of global capitalism.50 The
dismissal of the relevance of colonialism to a theory of capitalism has
come in many disciplinary shapes and colors, yet in one way or another,
they all flow into the metanarrative of endogenous capitalist
development in Europe and the rise of the West.51 Those who call this
Eurocentric standpoint into question have linked colonialism to global
capitalism in its capacity to "confiscate and conscript" land and labor
into circuits of capital, thereby overcoming resource constraints that
might have stifled capitalist expansion.52 Perhaps more importantly than
this crude material aspect, colonial economic spaces also functioned as
spaces for imagining and implementing new ways of organizing social
production for profit, at times by means so brutal that they would have
been difficult to imagine and let alone attempt in Europe--- genocidal
expropriation of native populations and chattel slavery being the most
obvious examples. In the words of two Atlantic historians,
"\[C\]olonization itself was an experiment in economics on a
transoceanic scale . . . it did act as a crucible in which economic,
social, and political experimentation with new ideas and approaches,
both imported from the old world and spawned in the new, were allowed to
flourish, often unfettered."53 This last point is also the reason this
study devotes more attention to colonial capitalist transformations than
to metropolitan ones. Primitive accumulation and capitalist innovation
flourished "unfettered" in the colonies because they were located
"beyond the line" of jus publicum Europeaum, that is, beyond the laws,
customs, and conventions that limited the use of force and fraud in
economic competition, social struggle, and political conflict in
Europe54: The "inside" encompassed the laws, institutions, and customs
of the mother country . . . The "outside," by contrast, was
characterized by imperial domination, the expropriation of vast
territories, decimation of indigenous peoples, theft of their resources,
enslavement, and the domination of vast tracts of land by private
capitalists . . . In these imperial dependencies, the rules of the
inside did not apply . . . violence defied the law, and bold physical
coercion by private actors remade markets.55 It is tempting to perceive
in this description an international order bifurcated between the
norm-bound spaces of Europe and exceptional spaces of the colonies. Yet,
as Antony Anghie has compellingly shown, far from existing in a legal
void untouched by European international public law, colonial spaces
were constituted as unbound by norms through a hierarchical
differentiation within the one and same sphere of international law.56
Molding colonial territories into the peripheries of the capitalist
world economy turned in great measure on defining them as "exceptional
zones of armed expropriation" and designating their inhabitants as
"expropriable subjects . . . shorn of political protection, ripe and
ready for confiscation."57 Furthermore, as Nikhil Singh correctly
observes, the colonies were domains not only for enacting plunder, that
is, primitive accumulation (or accumulation by dispossession), but also
for developing cuttingedge procedures, logics of calculation,
circulation, abstraction, and infrastructure---the slaver's management
of human cargo, the camp, the prison, the forward military
base---innovations that can proceed insofar as they are unfettered by
legally protected human beings advancing new prejudices, built upon the
old.58 Liberated from political, legal, or customary limits to
expropriation, enslavement, and plunder, colonial entrepreneurs, such as
planters, slave traders, merchants, and chartered company agents, found
a much freer hand in in reshaping local systems of production and
exchange wherever they managed to secure political or military
predominance. Consequently, although various forms of coerced
dispossession and bondage dotted the European landscape in the early
modern period, the union of political power and capital birthed much
more violent and much "primitive" methods of accumulation beyond the
"civilized" pale 24 Colonial Capitalism and the Dilemmas of Liberalism
of Europe. Brutal forms of economic extraction and exploitation in the
colonies represented the "systemic edges" of capitalist expansion in the
early modern period, where the scale and nature of the deep social
transformations central to the

birth of the global capitalist order fell into sharper relief.59

### 2AC \-- Link \-- AT: Identity Politics

#### Discussions of identity are marginalized in educational spaces under the guise of being "difficult" or "unrelated" to the subject matter -- their movement replicates this by refusing to engage with black scholars and activists in order to preserve the integrity of their anticapitalist movement.

Recently, I spoke with a white faculty member struggling to engage with
two Latinx students in her art history seminar. Two of only a handful of
nonwhite students in the class, the Latinx students repeatedly mentioned
race \-- of the artists, subjects and curators. To this instructor[, not
only were issues of race uncomfortable, but they were also tangential to
the subject matter:]{.underline} art and representation. The
[students,]{.underline} the professor said, by harping on these
concerns, had [needlessly introduced this "difficult" topic into the
classroom]{.underline}. [Conversations about race, class, sexuality and
other identities are often called "difficult" or
"uncomfortable."]{.underline} Mastering these conversations is
necessary, it is often said, because shifting student demographics in
higher education, including the increased enrollment of historically
underrepresented students, require faculty members to gain facility
discussing identity. This rationale is well intentioned as, on the
surface, it suggests that faculty must adopt culturally responsive
pedagogical practices to meet student needs. Additionally, this framing
is potentially learner-centered, as it acknowledges that the discomfort
of these "difficult" conversations must be braved to serve student
learning and well-being. And, given the recent widespread protests over
the murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery, among
others, professors who seek to carry on with business as usual, without
broaching topics such as systemic racism and anti-Blackness, risk
appearing tone-deaf and out of step with the current historical moment.
Yet [by linking the necessity of these conversations to changing student
demographics or current events, we suggest that identity is relevant
only when students who have been labeled "diverse" are present and/or
when those students call attention to identity.]{.underline} Only when
students of color are in the classroom, for example, must we acknowledge
race, or only when there are women in predominately male spaces must we
recognize gender. Thus, [this justification for these conversations
displaces the notion of "difficult" onto students who are labeled
diverse. Not only are such conversations "difficult," but the existence
and very presence of these students becomes difficult.]{.underline} Were
these Latinx students not in the class, or were they not vocal about
race, the art history professor implied, there would be no discomfort.
[This framing also furthers the fiction that when women,
first-generation students, low-income students, students with
disabilities, transgender students and so forth are in the classroom,
faculty members must put aside identity-neutral content and attend to
identity.]{.underline} The reality, however, is that [all students
benefit when a multiplicity of identities are reflected in the
classroom]{.underline}, whether in the curriculum or elsewhere.
["Difficult" allows us to dismiss and avoid \-- to further marginalize
those who surface identity by labeling them myopic or as promoting
identity politics. Yet all course content reflects identity
politics.]{.underline} For example, in my conversations with STEM
faculty members[, I often hear that their disciplines are evidence-based
and identity-free]{.underline}. But when prodded, those same instructors
might admit to not assigning readings with women as the lead authors, to
assuming a level of prior knowledge in introductory classes that favors
students from upper-middle-class high schools or to having group
projects in which female students often assume a housekeeping role
(e.g., note taker). In other words, these instructors eventually admit
that [underrepresented students do not introduce identity into the
classroom, but rather identity is always present in the classroom.
Identity is enacted through readings, assignments, classroom structures
and classroom norms \-- choices made and identities prioritized by
faculty members.]{.underline} The tragedy of the art history class is
that the Latinx students attended to ideas that the professor should
have considered: What groups have cultures worthy of preservation and
celebration? Who decides? What historical processes have allowed the
collectors and museums of one place to acquire the art of another? The
instructor viewed the students' considerations as tiresome and
one-dimensional. But the students, in my reading, understood that
complex human and historical forces shape art and representation.
Content is not value neutral. Moreover, attending to identity should not
depend on which students are present, and already-marginalized students
should not be burdened with surfacing issues of identity. Identity
informs all students' and instructors' experiences of the classroom,
even the experiences of those from dominant groups. For example, years
ago, I taught at a predominantly white institution. During the final
class, a student who identified as white, male and upper middle class
advocated removing poor children from their families and placing them in
boarding schools. This conversation, initiated by a student holding
dominant identities, could very well be described as difficult. As an
instructor, I was forced to confront a perspective different from my own
\-- one that I was shocked to learn my student held and one that I
personally found reprehensible. I felt stunned, but given that the
student had made the comment in front of 49 other students, I also felt
pressured to immediately respond. Therefore, in order to give the
student an opportunity to hear how outrageous his statement was and to
clarify, I repeated what he had said and asked if I had understood
correctly. When the student affirmed his position, I then opened the
conversation to all students and asked them to respond with reference to
texts we'd read that semester on topics such as assimilation and
culturally relevant pedagogy. In the discussion, the class countered
their peer's position using literature. I wrapped up the discussion by
thanking the student for surfacing the issue and by summarizing the key
concerns that his peers had raised. The reality is that [conversations
about identity challenge us. Indeed, it is important to acknowledge the
negative affective responses]{.underline} \-- including shame (over
one's lack of knowledge), fear (that one's biases might be exposed) and
defensiveness \-- that these conversations evoke. Spaces of Practice
Yes, conversations about identity challenge us. Yet, note that I use the
verb "challenge," rather than the modifier "challenging." This is not
simply semantics. Though these conversations may be difficult to
navigate, I would not call them "difficult." This modifier suggests that
identity is inherently troublesome \-- a notion that deserves
interrogation. Evan P. Apfelbaum and other scholars have found [that as
adolescents learn social norms, they also begin to understand that it is
socially unacceptable to discuss race. I wonder, could this finding be
extended to other identities, such as socioeconomic class and
sexuality?]{.underline} (Would you feel comfortable, for example, asking
your colleague her salary?) As a shorthand, calling certain
conversations "uncomfortable" allows for continued silence. [This
euphemism gestures toward identity but allows us to avoid directly
naming class, race, sexual orientation, gender, disability or other
identities we have grown accustomed to not naming.]{.underline} Perhaps
[conversations about identity]{.underline} are "difficult" not because
they are inherently uncomfortable, but because they [have been deemed
ineffable]{.underline}. Consequently, the first time many faculty
members \-- particularly those who view themselves and their disciplines
as identity neutral \-- are forced to consider and articulate their
stance on identity is in the classroom. Perhaps that occurs after a
student says something racist or otherwise derogatory, and the
instructor must fumble to respond while a room of nervous students
watches. But what if these conversations are not actually difficult, but
simply unpracticed? In other words, the classroom context and lack of
prior engagement with the topic might make the conversation difficult,
but the topic itself is not, I would offer, inherently difficult.
Therefore, perhaps faculty members need not fewer conversations about
identity but more. Specifically, suppose they had spaces in which to
understand the scholarship on diversity and inclusion, as well as
opportunities to consider implications to their teaching practices? I
imagine, for example, that it is rare to find faculty who object to
inclusive classrooms. However, it might be rarer still to find
instructors who can define an "inclusive" classroom, identify strategies
for fostering one or articulate what students experience in one. If
faculty had spaces of practice, they could gain facility identifying
strategies for fostering expected and unexpected conversations about
identity and for incorporating identity meaningfully into a class from
the first day. They wouldn't just believe, for example, that including a
sole Toni Morrison text to represent Black writers in a literature class
or asking gender pronouns in a science class will make these courses
more inclusive. Through faculty communities of practice, identity
conversations move from "difficult" and "uncomfortable" to manageable
and educative \-- and serve as important opportunities to model for
students how to talk and think about identity.

#### Identity politics is critical to the success of social movements -- it doesn't divide movements but rather unites them in a broader struggle for equality, marginalization divides movements [not]{.underline} identity politics.

**Garza '19** \-- Alicia Garza is an American civil rights activist and
writer known for co-founding the international Black Lives Matter
movement (Alicia Garza, 9-24-2019, \"Identity Politics: Friend or
Foe?,\" Othering & Belonging Institute,
<https://belonging.berkeley.edu/identity-politics-friend-or-foe>,
accessed 7-2-2021) //nikki

The term "identity politics" was first coined by Black feminist Barbara
Smith and the Combahee River Collective in 1974. Identity politics
originated from the need to reshape movements that had until then
prioritized the monotony of sameness over the strategic value of
difference. The "second wave" feminist movement fought for body
autonomy, pushed for women's equality and demanded that women be treated
as human beings. However, much like the first wave of feminism, which
was largely centered around women's suffrage and gaining the right to
vote, white women became the default standard for all women. While
segregation was no longer formally the law of the land in 1974, racism
and discrimination based on class was still deeply embedded in efforts
to achieve change, again, because the change desired was progress for
white women and not all women. Women who identified as feminists were
encouraged to join together on the basis of a common experience of
discrimination based on sex, with no attention paid to the fact that not
all women's experiences were the same, and further, that sex was not a
category that could adequately describe gender. This is the context for
the emergence of identity politics. Stated simply, [identity politics is
the assertion that "the most profound and potentially most radical
politics come directly out of our own identity, as opposed to working to
end somebody else's oppression]{.underline}."1 The Combahee River
Collective detailed how their experiences as Black women were different
than those of white women, and this mattered because understanding the
ways in which racial, economic, gender, and other oppressions were
linked and shaped their lives helped to make sure that no one could be
left behind. The purpose of this paper is to explore "identity politics"
and whether or not it is a useful tool for civic engagement and
movements today. In this paper, I argue that [identity politics is not
only widely misunderstood, but intentionally distorted in order to avoid
acknowledging the ways in which "identity" shapes the economy, our
democracy, and our society.]{.underline} I explore the [Black feminist
origins of identity politics]{.underline}, and explore how and why
identity politics is being weaponized among progressives and
conservatives---and with what consequences for increased participation
by marginalized groups in mainstream politics. Ultimately, I argue that
[identity politics is indeed a critical tool for organizing and civic
engagement. Recognizing oneself and one's experiences in politics is a
motivating factor for participation in that which is
political.]{.underline} At a moment when America is facing some of the
sharpest political polarization that it has seen in decades, anyone
looking to secure the participation of marginalized groups had better
start acknowledging that they're marginalized in the first place, and
second, working to design policy solutions that leave no one behind.
What We Get Wrong about Identity Politics Leaving no one behind is
ideal, and, despite the best intentions, [people are always getting left
behind in social movements---particularly when the differences that
emerge as a result of various forms of oppression are erased or
intentionally ignored.]{.underline} Social change work is a series of
scientific experiments. In experiments, to determine whether or not
change has occurred, you have to have a control. The control in a
scientific experiment is, by definition, a sample that remains the same
through an experiment. The control helps you to determine whether or not
change has happened. The control must remain the same or equal at all
times to ensure accurate measurement of results. In social change
movements in America, the control is often based on the progress that
white people are making in their lives against a white standard. In the
women's movement, for example, the measure of progress is taken as
whether or not change and progress is happening in the lives of white
women. It's well known that there is a lack of parity in wages between
cisgender (people for whom their gender assigned at birth matches their
gender identity) men and women. On average, cisgender women make 85
cents to every dollar a cisgender man makes.2 Women of all racial and
ethnic groups make less than their male counterparts, and also make less
than white men. Black women make 65.3 cents to every dollar that a white
man makes, and 89 cents to every dollar a Black man makes. Latinx women
make 61.6 cents to every dollar that a white man makes, and 85.7 percent
of what a Latinx man makes. Among Latinx transgender and gender
non-conforming people, 28 percent reported making less than \$10,000 a
year, and 34 percent of Black transgender and gender non-conforming
people report the same.3 [It is significant that discussions of the
gender wage gap often start off with the assumption that all women make
85 cents to every dollar men make, since that is only true for white
women. Without this qualification, one might think that all women make
80 cents to each dollar a man makes. Time and time again, the
experiences of white communities are used as the framework from which to
understand inequality, and yet the communities experiencing inequality
from a range of factors, all at the same time, are communities of color.
From]{.underline} abortion rights to pay equity, comparing the
conditions of white women to white men has been the way to assess
whether or not change is actually happening and progress is being made.
[Identity politics holds us accountable to ask more questions about for
whom progress is being made. The significant gaps in wages for Black and
Latinx women indicate that while some are making progress, others
continue to lag behind. Identity politics says that no longer should we
be expected to fight against someone else's oppression without fighting
against our own, too.]{.underline} The Combahee River Collective was
concerned with how [our lived experiences shape our lives]{.underline},
and [identity politics offered social movements]{.underline}, like the
women's movement, [the gift of uncovering what had been ignored or
devalued. Black women who were poor and working class wanted feminism as
much as white middle-class women did. Identity politics not only showed
Black women that we were worthy of feminism---worthy of being treated as
human beings---but it also gave white middle class women the gift of
understanding that for feminism to succeed, feminism could not pretend
that the world revolves around the struggle for parity between white
women and white men.]{.underline} Whiteness as the Standard The
worldview and experiences of white communities is also shaping the
debate about identity politics[. Racial identity is an invented series
of social categories which have impacts on power and agency socially,
economically, and politically. Though race is socially constructed, it
has material and practical implications for the lives of those who have
been assigned racial categories at the losing end of the spectrum of
power.]{.underline} Racial categorizations that fall on the side of the
spectrum that are non-white tend to lack power and agency vis-à-vis
those that are on the white side of the spectrum. Whiteness in America
functions the same way that a "control" does in an experiment. In an
experiment, to measure whether or not change has happened, you have to
have a control---largely considered to be a standard against which
change is compared. You know if change has occurred through your
experiment when the entity being experimented on changes as a result of
your intervention---because the control does not change. [In the social
experiment called America, progress or change is determined by whether
or not conditions have changed for white people and against a white
standard.]{.underline} Another way to look at this is not as an
experiment, but instead, through the lens of what is considered
"normal." If I go to the store right now and look for Band-Aids, the
color will be compatible with white skin, not mine. If I look for a pair
of pantyhose, it's not as likely I'll find a shade that matches my skin.
And up until a year ago, it was close to impossible for women of color
to find shades of foundation. In America, "nude" or "flesh-toned" means
white. Again, [the standard in America is what is white---what appeals
to white people, what makes sense to white people, what activates and
motivates white people, and so on]{.underline}. It's not just true at
the beauty store---it's true throughout the economy, our democracy, and
the rest of our society. If [whiteness is the standard, it also is the
criteria used to determine whether ideas, actions, or experiences have
worth, merit, or value. Whiteness attempts to determine what is valid.
Too often, whiteness dismisses the experiences and worldviews of people
who are not white, because the opinions, values, needs, and beliefs of
people who are not white are not considered to have merit, particularly
when compared to whiteness.]{.underline} When the Black Lives Matter
movement exploded across the world, [whiteness worked to define whether
or not the anger of Black people was legitimate and justified, and at
the same time, whiteness attempted to redefine the movement as
dangerous, aimless, misguided, and violent.]{.underline} Whiteness
attempted to de-fang the power of Black Lives Matter as a slogan and a
rallying cry with "All Lives Matter" effectively erasing any mention of
race[. Changing "Black Lives Matter" to "All Lives Matter" turns what
was a discourse on structural racism, police, and other forms of state
violence into a two-dimensional conversation where race either does or
doesn't matter. Race-neutral language is a core tenet of
whiteness---race, and racial oppression or racial exclusion, is made
invisible on the surface while at the same time being allowed to
organize the economy, democracy, and society.]{.underline} [Whiteness is
the control and the standard because whiteness is fundamentally about
power. Whiteness attempts to shape worldviews, ideas, and experiences
because whiteness seeks to maintain the power it has been afforded, and
subsequently affords to people who have been designated as white, for
the purposes of implementing whiteness and, as such, implementing
power]{.underline}. The debate over identity politics is no exception to
this rule. Not everyone sees identity politics as a gift. In the
aftermath of the 2016 election, a plethora of articles appeared in news
outlets, slamming "liberal identity politics." Television pundits began
to decry "identity politics" as the reason that Democrats lost the
presidential election. There are a number of arguments that are deployed
against identity politics, and they are deployed for a number of
reasons. [One such argument declares that a fixation on diversity
renders people incapable of seeing outside of their own experience,
preventing them from being able to build relationships with those who do
not share their experiences. And, in the political realm, they argue
that a focus on differences, rather than what we share in
common]{.underline}, is a strategic mistake in elections. It is worth
noting that these arguments are primarily deployed towards those who are
not white. [These arguments rest on the notion that identity politics,
as they define them, leave people out---and yet they fail to acknowledge
that the politics of identity are not responsible for the prevalence of
those identities. Identity is only important when]{.underline}---through
no fault of your own---[you are assigned an identity that promises worse
life outcomes than those who are not assigned an identity that is
marginalized from power.]{.underline} [Following the logic of
contrarians of identity politics, no one should pay attention to the
fact that being assigned "Black" almost guarantees that your life
chances will be worse than someone who is assigned a "white"
identity]{.underline}, because it could alienate a white person and
leave them out of the conversation. [Instead of addressing the fact that
Black people are more likely to die in childbirth than white people,
that Black people with disabilities are eight times more likely to be
shot and killed by police than their white counterparts, that Black
people on average are twice as likely to be poor or to be unemployed
than white people, or that white households are 13 times as wealthy as
Black households, critics of identity politics would prefer we not
address these disparities, for fear of alienating people who are not
experiencing them.]{.underline} [The real problem in America isn't
identity politics and making difference visible---it's that those
discrepancies exist in the first place. Critics of identity politics,
intentionally or unintentionally, uphold a logic of whiteness that
functions in similar ways to that of the edict presented in the movie
The Wizard of Oz---they want you to pay no attention to the man behind
the curtain.]{.underline} Does Identity Politics Bridge or Divide?
[Another fallacy from critics of identity politics is that identifying
and addressing differences somehow prevent people with different
histories, backgrounds, ethnicities, identities, or experiences from
finding commonality.]{.underline} For example, Black communities are not
the only ones who suffer from the ways in which whiteness distributes
power unevenly in favor of white communities. Communities who are not
white are not a monolith---and communities who share an experience of
marginalization or disenfranchisement can and often do come together,
across their differences, to end that marginalization. But this doesn't
and shouldn't mean that they leave their identities at the door. Just
like Black communities experience the negative effects of entrenched
white power, so do Latinx communities, Arab communities, Muslim
communities, Pacific Islander communities, Asian diasporic communities,
and so on. To be clear, these [communities do not just come together
because they are marginalized. They come together to achieve a common
goal---freedom and equality for all of us.]{.underline} [Critics of
identity politics are correct when they caution that a focus primarily
on experience can detract from building alliances or developing a plan
of action. That certainly is true when identity politics isn't geared
towards shifting the balance of power. However, critics of identity
politics should be careful not to paint with such a broad
brush.]{.underline} The Combahee River Collective wasn't a knitting
circle---they were a group of Black women, many of whom identified as
lesbian and poor, who pushed the movements they should have been a part
of to be more effective in acknowledging the impacts of race, class,
gender, disability and more on the issues they were trying to impact,
together, for the sake of the collective. [Demanding that anyone divorce
their lived experience from their participation in political action is
not only dangerous, but it serves to reinforce power dynamics that are
bad for the collective.]{.underline} What's ironic about the controversy
surrounding identity politics is that [few seem to take issue with the
white identity politics shaping our lives. The critiques of identity
politics only arise when those who are marginalized and disconnected
from power assert that their experiences matter, and demand action to
ensure that they can, in fact, achieve parity socially, economically,
and politically with whites.]{.underline} In the lead up to the 2016
Presidential election, Donald Trump ran on the slogan of "Make America
Great Again." Making America great again insinuated that America was
great before, leaving one to ask: "What are we trying to restore America
to, and what are we trying to change it from?" Throughout the campaign,
the answer became clear---America, apparently, was great before its
demographics changed, before women had rights, before Black people could
stand up for their rights, and so on. The America invoked by Trump was
an America run and dominated by white, Christian, heterosexual men. That
America was powered by blue-collar manufacturing jobs, and in that
America, people of color, women, and others did not have equal rights to
white men. In that America, the one that Trump and before him President
Ronald Reagan idealized, it was illegal for Black people to share public
accommodations with white people. [The problem that those who decried
identity politics had, then, was with what identity politics did when
used to empower those who lacked power---in society, in the economy, and
in American democracy. Identity politics is a threat to those who hold
and wield power, because it destabilizes the control against which all
else is compared. Identity politics is a threat to white power because
it asserts that whiteness has shaped all of our lives in ways that do
not benefit us---even those who possess that privilege.]{.underline} Far
from being an edict of political correctness, [identity politics asks us
to see the world as it actually is, and more than that, it demands that
we equalize the playing field.]{.underline} [Those who claim that
identity politics is counterproductive and divisive often seek to build
movements on that which they claim we all have in common, and cite
economic status as an equalizer that everyone can get
behind.]{.underline} Yet in an economy that is racialized and gendered,
such notions are wishful thinking at best, and willful ignorance at
worst. The Consequences of a False Debate [The fight over identity
politics is a false one; it forces false choices and even worse,
inauthentic ones.]{.underline} Conservative movements have identified
race and gender in particular as arenas where neutrality is strategic to
maintain white, heterosexual, male, cisgendered power, at the expense of
everyone who does not occupy those social positions. They have
identified that inequality resulting from race and gender, and other
social indicators that have economic implications, is best left
undiscussed, lest it be uncovered that there are people that benefit
from the disenfranchisement and oppression of marginalized communities.
Simultaneously, the same forces inside of liberal and progressive
movements have adopted the same stance, using talking points from
conservatives to justify their resistance to upending oppressions other
than that resulting from economic inequality. This, of course, has
consequences for progressive movements and civic engagement efforts. A
refusal to acknowledge inequities inside of a movement almost guarantees
that those inequities will not be addressed in any substantive way,
which guarantees that the lives of those who depend on transformative
social movements the most will not change in any substantive way. We
should be concerned about this because it is, in fact, exactly the
agenda that our opposition hopes to achieve---no real substantive
changes in the relationships of power, or their outcomes.
