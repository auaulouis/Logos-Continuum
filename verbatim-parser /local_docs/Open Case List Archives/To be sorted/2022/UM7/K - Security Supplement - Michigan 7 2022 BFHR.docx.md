[Beyond the problems with the scientific evidence behind Thayer's
ontological claims, there are also problems with his proposed
epistemological project of consilience.]{.underline} [[Using
sociobiology to unite]{.mark} the [social and natural
sciences]{.mark}]{.underline} (and to give bases to a revitalized
classical realism) [[would depend on]{.mark} achieving a near
**[omnipotence]{.mark}**, where known genetic programs could be weighed
against known environmental influence, using science to predict the
results.]{.underline} At the outset of his essay, Thayer implies that
science is progressing at a rapid pace towards making this a reality.
Yet [[evolutionary explanations]{.mark} for specific behaviours [become
incredibly problematic given]{.mark} all of the possible factors and
[externalities]{.mark} which might have affected evolutionary
outcomes,]{.underline} all of [[which are impossible to map
into]{.mark}]{.underline} even the most [[complex]{.mark}]{.underline}
mathematical [[theoretical games.]{.underline}]{.mark} [Bell and
MacDonald point out that many [biologists dispute]{.mark} [whether
sociobiology can offer]{.mark} useful [commentary on humans]{.mark}
"[because of the]{.mark} central [role of culture,]{.mark} language, and
self-reflexivity in determining human behaviour."]{.underline}
Similarly, in response to Shaw and Wong, Joshua Goldstein cites evidence
that [[human]{.mark}]{.underline} 5 6 [being[s]{.mark} [do not
demonstrate a]{.mark}n [inherent tendency towards aggression, instead
displaying cooperation more often]{.mark}]{.underline}. Goldstein offers
the possibility that human [behavioural traits like aggression,
altruism, and sacrifice are shaped more by cultural transmission than by
genes]{.underline}. This possibility enormously complicates the attempt
at consilience intended by Thayer and his contemporaries, by adding in
incalculable variables that come with social and cultural interactions.
5 7 Because of these complications, Lewontin, Rose, and Kamin have
asserted that [sociobiology's grand argument is discredited since **no
aspect of human social behaviour has** ever **been linked to a specific
gene** or set of genes.]{.underline} As Mary Clark observes, [one of the
major results of the human genome project was the]{.underline} 5 8
[falsification of the supposition that each protein produced in a human
cell was coded by a separate gene.]{.underline} In fact, [genes often
work interdependently, with the same gene recurring along the chromosome
and causing different outcomes depending on its position and
neighbouring genes.]{.underline} Clark describes the complex signals and
activations which occur at the genetic level, concluding that [rather
than a linear unidirectional blueprint, the **human genome is more like
an ecosystem**, and can be responsive to its microscopic]{.underline} --
[and]{.underline} perhaps even [the macroscopic --
environment.]{.underline} 5 9 Just how important are the influences
culture, social behaviour, and environment to the human condition, as
distinct from biological programming? In many caveats and footnotes
within Thayer's own argument, he includes statements that acknowledge
the importance of cultural factors in the shaping of modern human
societies. [If all behaviour cannot be explained by sociobiology and
other evolutionary arguments because]{.underline} behaviours are
contingent on cultural and environmental factors[, how strong is the
scientific support for]{.underline} Thayer's revived realist project? As
Bell and MacDonald have suggested, [many of the [scientific foundations
Thayer employs]{.mark} to support his epistemological program [are
indeterminate because they cannot explain when cultural or environmental
factors will play a role]{.mark}]{.underline}. On the ontological side,
[Thayer certainly comes a long]{.underline} 6 0 [way from proving that
human nature is defined by and limited to egoism and dominance, as he
had intended to do.]{.underline} If knowledge borrowed from evolutionary
biology and other natural sciences suggests that culture and environment
play a significant role in shaping human behaviours, then it may not be
the realist project that is best supported by a deep and sustained
interdisciplinary exploration.

#### Expansionary modernization is reactionary to US provocation

[While Mearsheimer claims that great powers act
aggressively]{.underline} and aim [to gain]{.underline} so much
[power]{.underline} that they are the ultimate hegemons in the system,
Waltz's [defensive realism sees the states as acting defensively to
maintain rather than upset the balance of power]{.underline}. For Waltz,
[the [states are primarily concerned with maintaining]{.mark} "[their
position in the system]{.mark}."]{.underline}55 Defensive realists argue
that [**[offence-defence balance favours]{.mark} the [defence]{.mark}**.
56 Therefore, a robust defence and careful balancing should deter any
aggressive impulses from great power]{.underline}s. Defensive realism
argues that [[great powers are concerned with maintaining the status
quo]{.mark} rather than maximising their power [because]{.mark} often
the [cost of expansion outweighs the benefits]{.mark}. Defensive realism
sees security dilemmas as a problem]{.underline} where an increase in
the power of one state increases the insecurity of the other causing the
latter to increase its power. [Under]{.underline} the conditions of
[defensive realism, great powers would try to alleviate any security
dilemmas rather than exacerbate it.]{.underline} China's current policy
seems to be firmly rooted in defensive realism. Its policy seems to be
aimed at maintaining the balance of power rather than upsetting it. As
the earlier section has argued, [China is not a revisionist power but a
status quo one]{.underline}. The analysts like Shiping Tang are
convinced that China's security strategy flows out of its realisation of
the security dilemma whereby the [[Chinese leaders have understood
that]{.mark} an aggressive [expansionist strategy would]{.mark} just
[lead to counterbalancing alliances]{.mark}. "This recognition has
[led]{.mark} China [to]{.mark} adopt [a defensive realism-rooted
security strategy **emphasising moderation, self-restraint and security
cooperation**]{.mark}]{.underline}."57 Moreover, China's military
modernisation, its Taiwan policy and its increased policies in the South
China Sea also make more sense if seen through the lens of defensive
realism. China's Taiwan policy may be more geared towards preventing
redistribution of power in the region. Since the US is providing arms
assistance to Taiwan, China may be averse to the US aiding Taiwan's
independence ─ the latter issue is one where China has made clear that
independence is not acceptable to China. Similarly, there is good
evidence that China's military modernisation programmes and training
exercises since the Taiwan Strait Crisis of 1996 are aimed partially at
dealing with the issue of the Taiwanese separation.58 On the question of
whether China is balancing against the US, Johnston says, "[There seems
to be little doubt that [China's military modernisation]{.mark}
programme since the mid-1990s has been [aimed in large measure at
developing capabilities to deter]{.mark} or slow the application of the
[US military power]{.mark} in the region]{.underline}."59 It would then
seem [that China is not concerned with gaining power or projecting its
powers but with balancing against a predominance of the US power in the
region. [China has not shown any signs of hegemonic behaviour]{.mark} as
a lot of Western analysts feared]{.underline}. Instead of guided by
offensive realism, China's policies seem to be guided by defensive
realism where it is concerned with survival and with maintaining its
position in the system. Just as the US fears China's hegemonic rise,
China also fears the increase of the US influence in the region and its
talk of containing China. China's policy may change in the future to
display hegemonic tendencies. However, at present, [[there is **not much
evidence to support**]{.mark} the theory of **[offensive
realism.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

**2AC de Araujo 14** (Marcelo, "Moral Enhancement and Political
Realism," Journal of Evolution and Technology 24(2): 29-43)

The idea of a "structure" should not be understood here in metaphysical
terms, as though it mysteriously existed in a transcendent world and had
the magical power of determining leaders' decisions in this world. The
word "structure" denotes merely a political arrangement in which there
are no powerful law-enforcing institutions. And in the absence of the
kind of security that law-enforcing institutions have the force to
create, political leaders will often fail to cooperate, and occasionally
engage in conflicts and wars, in those areas that are critical to their
security and survival. Given the structure of international politics and
the basic goal of survival, this is likely to continue to happen, even
if, in the future, political leaders become less egoistic and
power-seeking through moral enhancement. On the other hand, **[[since
the]{.mark} structure of the international [system of states is itself
another human institution, there is no reason to suppose that it cannot
ever be changed. If people become morally enhanced]{.mark} in the future
[they]{.mark} may possibly feel more strongly motivated to [change the
structure]{.mark} of the system of states, [or]{.mark} perhaps even feel
inclined to [abolish it altogether]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In my view,
however, addressing major threats to the survival of humankind in the
future by means of bioengineering is unlikely to yield the expected
results, so long as moral enhancement is pursued within the present
framework of the international system of states.
