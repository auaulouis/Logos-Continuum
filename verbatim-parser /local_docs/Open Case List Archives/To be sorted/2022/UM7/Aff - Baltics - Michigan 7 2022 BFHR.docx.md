# Baltics Aff

# Notes

Shout out to Kevin Lai, Archan Sen, Lily Ren, Daniel Gallagher, and
Brandon Yao for their work on this file.

The aff would have the US work to cooperate with NATO Baltic States on
cyber defense. It would be a form of mutual cooperation where the US
would help provide information and expertise towards Baltic States and
states such as Estonia would share information regarding combating
Russian cyber disinformation campaigns, attacks, etc.

<https://www.politico.eu/article/baltic-cyber-spillover-ukraine-russia-attack/)LR>

[The conflict between Russia and Ukraine puts neighboring EU countries
at risk of disruption from cyberattacks and the spread of
disinformation, officials warned Tuesday]{.underline}. [\"The **Baltic
states**, for Russia, **are the easiest way to put pressure
on**]{.underline} the EU and [**NATO** \... This is the place where **we
have to pay careful attention**,]{.underline}\" said Bart Groothuis,
Liberal member of the European Parliament and former cybersecurity
official at the Dutch Ministry of Defense. Groothuis is leading a
delegation of members of the European Parliament\'s subcommittee on
defense and security on [visits to Estonia on Tuesday and Lithuania on
Wednesday, in what he said was a \"show of solidarity\" with
Ukraine.]{.underline} [Those two Baltic countries are already involved
in a cyber defense operation to support Ukraine through the EU\'s Cyber
Rapid Response Team]{.underline}, which was activated Tuesday. [The
**threat of cyberattacks on European soil is** **two-fold:
First,**]{.underline} [attacks launched on Ukrainian networks could
spread to European networks. **Second, Russia could choose to launch
direct attacks on European targets** through its intelligence services
or cybercriminal groups to **disrupt** the West\'s **response to the
Ukraine crisis**. Cyberattacks on Ukraine have affected Europe in the
past.]{.underline} In 2017, hackers spread malware known [as NotPetya
through a Ukrainian piece of software and triggered a worldwide cyber
crisis seen as the most devastating cyberattack in history.]{.underline}
Western security services later attributed the attack to Russia\'s
military intelligence agency GRU. \"There is always the threat of a
spillover\" like NotPetya, said Jaak Tarien, director at the Cooperative
Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE), a NATO-accredited cyber
defense center based in Tallinn that advises the defense alliance and
its members on cybersecurity. \"It\'s the one internet we\'re using,\"
Tarien said, pointing to the connections Europe\'s tech networks have
with Ukraine. [Baltic countries, in particular, in past years were often
the target of campaigns by Russian state-backed hacking groups targeting
public and private institutions.]{.underline} The EU attributed a
campaign known as \"Ghostwriter\" at least in part to Russia, after it
first plagued Baltic countries with phishing emails and disinformation
campaigns and then moved on to target Polish and German politicians.
[Countries like **Estonia and Lithuania** have also **emerged as vocal
proponents** of a **tougher response to Russian cyber aggression in
Europe.** Officials in the Baltics are now on high alert, expecting more
attacks to come from Russia as the conflict in Ukraine
escalates]{.underline}. Last week, Lithuania\'s Ministry of Defense
raised the alarm, saying it expected serious cyberattacks on the
country\'s public authorities. [\"We definitely see how, as the general
state of security deteriorates, the likelihood of cyber activities
increases. We\'re working on a higher alert level,\"]{.underline} said
Margiris Abukevičius, vice minister at the Ministry of National Defense
in Lithuania.

#### Russia will use disinformation in order to destabilize the region

OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE BALTIC STATES"

[The other non-military threat for the Baltic region is Moscow's use of
the Russophone minority as political instruments against the West. For
example, signs of warfare were identified when Russian-speaking
inhabitants in Vilnius received brochures with disinformation on the
economic situation in Lithuania and a call to participate in the
resettlement of ethnic Russians from Lithuania to Russia.13 This kind of
propaganda was also used in Ukraine to disrupt loyalty to the State. The
Baltic countries need to create a "defensive shield" to fight against
Russia's disinformation and propaganda. Moscow's primary goal is to form
a positive opinion of Russia among local inhabitants by creating
dissatisfaction with the relevant governments, shaping and
misrepresenting historical facts, and exploiting the vulnerabilities of
the Baltic's political systems, economy, and society. Here the
Lithuanian case can serve as a guide for the other two Baltic States and
NATO members, too.]{.underline} The roots of the anti-Russian propaganda
and disinformation campaign originated in 2016, when Lithuania
introduced temporary bans on Russian media outlets that breached
pre-existing media laws.14 Shortly after that, the Lithuanian parliament
adopted an ordinance restricting Russian media production content on
Lithuanian TV. In 2018, the Lithuanian parliament adopted new amendments
to the Public Information Law. TV channels in Lithuania must translate
TV programs into Lithuanian "if these programs are produced in Russian
or other non-EU languages and broadcast for longer than one hour and a
half."15 [Such restrictions are effective at diminishing the Russian
influence, but are not a panacea. As for cyber security, the Baltic
States have undertaken successful work in combating cyber-attacks.
According to the International Telecommunication Union's Global
Cybersecurity Index 2020, among 194 countries, Estonia is ranked third
after the US and the UK. Followed by the Russian Federation, Lithuania
is the sixth-best cyber protected country. Latvia completes the list of
the top 15.16 This ranking is based on five pillars: legal, technical,
organizational, capacity building, and cooperation measurements related
to cybersecurity]{.underline}. Since 2019, these countries have each had
Cyber Security Strategies, but we have to consider that these rankings
are not always reliable, and sometimes they do not represent reality in
all its shapes. Despite establishing the NATO cooperative Cyber Defence
Centre of Excellence in 2008 (hosted by Estonia), several commentators
have criticized the real cyber warfare capabilities of NATO. In a 2019
interview, the former supreme allied commander of NATO, Adm. James
Stavridis, USN (Ret.), warned that "in cyber, and cybersecurity, we have
the greatest mismatch between the level of threat and level of
preparation."17 New asymmetric or technological threats require
extensive cooperation not only within but also outside of the Alliance.
The security and defence sectors in the Baltic States need to build
partnerships with the private and academic sectors, all of which will
need to cooperate with each other to maintain situational and
technological awareness.18 [It is clear that, in reality, the ongoing
conflict between western countries and Russia does not take place inside
tanks or submarines but behind a computer. Russia has massively
increased its cyber warfare capabilities and is particularly strong in
social manipulation and other cyber-attacks. In this context, there are
signs of significant commitment over time to enable the Baltic countries
to develop their national defence further. For example, the Baltic
States have already signed a five-year roadmap of defence cooperation
with the Pentagon,19 meaning that, by 2024, capability development and
defence-related aid, training exercises, and cyber defence will be
exercised with the US. Officials emphasized the benefits of this program
and said that they look forward to its further development. Activated
transatlantic relationships are the perfect opportunity for Lithuania,
Latvia, and Estonia to generate new partnership programs, agreements,
and projects against Russian soft power.]{.underline}

#### Aims to destabilize Baltics separate from NATO makes deterring Russia impossible -- now is key after Ukraine

**Kols 2022,** Rihards Kols Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee
The Saeima (Parliament) of the Republic of Latvia (3/17/2022 "Hybrid
Threats: The Baltic Perspective"
https://www.csce.gov/sites/helsinkicommission.house.gov/files/RKols_Hybrid%20threats%20Baltic%20Perspective-2022.pdf

[Since regaining our independence from the Soviet Union in 1990, Latvia,
Lithuania, and Estonia have been under constant Russian
pressure.]{.underline} This pressure has manifested itself is through
the conventional military threat, punctuated by ongoing airspace
violations by Russian military aircraft and navy, unannounced,
large-scale military exercises of inherently offensive nature along
their borders, and the general disposition of Russia\'s military forces
in regions closest to the Baltic borders, doing so under the pretence of
counteracting the \"hostile West\" and promoting militarism. [Influence,
psychological, and information operations have been part of Russian
doctrine since the early days of the Soviet Union, but historically they
have been relegated to supporting roles. Nevertheless, as General
Gerasimov has observed and thus included in the Russian military
doctrine, non-kinetic are exceedingly practical, and]{.underline}
[**these instruments will become dominant in future warfare. This is
reflected in most current Russian foreign, security and defence policies
and doctrinal documents.** For years, the strategic goal of Russian
information operations in the Baltic states has been to create distance
between the Baltics and the West.]{.underline} [The Russian concept is
rooted in the idea that democratic societies are vulnerable to political
manipulation, and exploiting this perceived weakness is far less costly
than pursuing annexation or occupation]{.underline}. Consequently,
Russian information operations in the Baltics focus on nine objectives:
[(1) Encourage and support armed actions by separatist groups to promote
chaos and territorial disintegration; (2) Increase polarisation between
elites and society to foment a crisis of values followed by process of
orientation toward Russian values; (3) Demoralise the military and
otherwise attrit resolve; (4) Undermine socioeconomic stability; (5)
Engender socio-political crisis; (6) Intensify simultaneous forms and
models of psychological warfare to demoralise the Baltic states\' armed
forces and population and break their resolve; (7) Incite mass panic and
degrade confidence in crucial government institutions; (8) Defame
political leaders not aligned with Russian interests; (9) and Undermine
international alliances and partnerships]{.underline}.12 [Russia seeks
to achieve its strategic ends in the Baltics through influence
operations rather than conventional means]{.underline}. Recognising
resistance to deeper ties with Russia in the Baltics, **[Russia has
diversified its messaging beyond pro-Russia content. Instead, the
Russian strategy is to attempt to convince members of the population
that their countries\' current alignment with the West, embrace of
democracy, and membership in NATO and the EU are in some way
detrimental, degrading or dangerous.]{.underline}** [Russia heavily
leverages Russian and local-language traditional media, social media,
and the internet toward this end. There is no universally agreed
definition of hybrid threats, considering that a wide range of
activities falls under this term. Moreover, hybrid threats evolve
constantly, and new means in hybrid warfare emerge.]{.underline}
However, the European Centre of Excellence for Countering Hybrid Threats
defines hybrid threats as \"an action conducted by state or non-state
actors, whose goal is to undermine or harm a target by influencing its
decision-making at the local, regional, state or institutional level.
[Such actions are coordinated and synchronised and deliberately target
democratic states and institutions\' vulnerabilities\". 3 The use of
hybrid tactics often is based on trying to undermine fundamental
democratic values and liberties, and it is done under what some call a
\"chaos strategy\". Russia sows chaos to achieve its agenda beyond its
borders by deploying an array of hybrid warfare tools - hybrid warfare
is a tactical application of the chaos strategy. Total spectrum warfare
deploys a blend of conventional and nonconventional means to affect on
the ground changes in target populations or territories while seeking to
avoid direct military confrontation.]{.underline} Hybrid warfare is
employed in a tailored way to sow chaos in target countries. Such
efforts generally include irregular warfare, active measures, and
special operations. Like the world, hybrid war is not static, and new
tools are developed and employed constantly. For the Baltics, having
lived in this environment for the majority of their lives, both under
Soviet occupation and after regaining their countries\' independence,
this multi-vector warfare - hybrid warfare tactics and the chaos they
attempt to create, have become intuitively recognisable and often seep
into the background like white noise.4 From the perspective of the
Baltic states, the development of hybrid threat-related policies at the
EU or NATO level has been a natural consequence of the changing security
landscape in Europe, especially the gradually deteriorating relations
between the West and Russia. [In the immediate aftermath of Russia\'s
first attack on Ukraine\'s sovereignty and territorial integrity,
different hybrid attack scenarios against one of the three Baltic states
were envisaged, e.g., Russia\'s attempt to overtake Narva, a city in the
extreme eastern point of Estonia, where more than 80% of the population
are ethnic Russians; or the so-called \"little green men\", armed
soldiers without insignia that were seen in Crimea in March 2014,
entering Latgale, the region in Latvia\'s east5 ; or Russia creating an
incident linked to Kaliningrad -- the Russian enclave on the Baltic sea
wedged between Lithuania and Poland]{.underline}. [In the event of any
war between Russia and NATO countries, it is through this gap that NATO
would have to rush reinforcements and supplies from Poland to the Baltic
countries, and it is this gap that Russia would have to close to prevent
that]{.underline}. [Military strategists have long suggested that
Russian forces from Belarus could attempt to punch across the narrow
Lithuanian territory known as the Suwalki Gap to the Moscow-controlled
enclave of Kaliningrad, effectively cutting off the three Baltic
states.]{.underline} 6 **[These scenarios included Russia sending troops
to \"restore order\" in case of an uprising in Kaliningrad or sabotaging
the train lines across Lithuania that serve as a vital transit corridor
from Russia.]{.underline}** [Because Baltic rail infrastructure is still
primarily dominated by Soviet-era rails of a specific gauge width, one
incompatible with the EU standard rail gauge width, the risks are
substantial enough to cause concern. It has been considered that Russia
could use the same pretext as in Ukraine, i.e., protection of the
Russian-speaking minorities, to target one of the countries in the
region, or rely on state-controlled Russian TV channels widely watched
by ethnic Russians in the Baltics to spread propaganda and air true and
imagined grievances.7]{.underline}

Introduction In recent years, awareness of [[Russian
disinfo]{.mark}rmation activities]{.underline} and disinformation
efforts [[has been **growing**]{.underline}]{.mark} both
[[in]{.underline}]{.mark} the West and in Central and **[[Eastern
Europe]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Baumann, 2020; Kuczyńska-Zonik &
Tatarenko, 2019). Russian disinformation is considered to have achieved
some success even in the most developed western countries, where it is
presumed to have interfered in the election campaign in the USA
(Golovchenko et al., 2020), harassed and impeded independent
investigations in Western Europe (Aro, 2016), sought to impair public
support for Western assistance to former Soviet countries (Richey,
2018), and significantly affected the election campaign in France
(Makhashvili, 2017). Among [the **main targets**]{.underline} [for
Russian disinformation are the]{.underline} former Soviet Union
countries that in Russia are referred to by a unique term coined in
1992, called "**[near abroad]{.underline}**," (ближнее зарубежье) which
attempts to emphasize their status as foreign countries not fully
recognized by Russia (Rotaru, 2018). [[Russian
disinfo]{.mark}rmation]{.underline} in the "near abroad" countries
[seek]{.underline} two main objectives: [to [inflict]{.mark} as much
**[damage to]{.mark} the [statehood]{.mark}** of the target countries
[and]{.mark} to [portray Russia in]{.mark} much **[better
colors]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the eyes of their citizens (Shakrai,
2015), typically by distorting historical events (Ehrlich, 2021).
Although the aim of preventing former Soviet Union Republics from fully
diverging from the Russian sphere of influence (Cooley, 2017; Dunn &
Bobick, 2014), [the Russian Federation has made the Baltic States a
target of **continuous negative disinfo**rmation and **psychological
subversion** tactics]{.underline} (Veebel, 2015), making the
disinformation dominated by negative messaging (Thornton & Karagiannis,
2016). It is even stated that among all the European nations, citizens
of the Baltic States experience the most concentrated and sophisticated
disinformation efforts as an expression of soft power (Simons, 2015).
Such Russian disinformation has been affecting the citizens of the
Baltic States for more than the past three decades. Arguably residents
of the Baltic States are believed to be more susceptible and receptive
to various forms of Russian disinformation, having been subject to some
50 years of Soviet brainwashing (Schuhrke, 2019; Thompson, 2019). [[Such
disinfo]{.mark}rmation [**increases dissatisfaction**
with]{.mark}]{.underline} domestic [[governments]{.underline}]{.mark}
(Golovchenko, 2022) [and the state of **democracy**]{.underline}
generally (Oates, 2016), [lowers incentives for personal
self-development]{.underline} (Benkler et al., 2018), [[and
provokes]{.mark} **[anger]{.mark}** and social **[inequality]{.mark}**
within society]{.underline} (Bardach-Yalov, 2012). [There
are]{.underline} additional [thoroughly documented cases about
the]{.underline} **[[intimidation]{.underline}]{.mark}** [of Baltic
States]{.underline} from the Russian side. Matthews (2020) points out at
[Russian actions aimed at increasing **[ethnic
tensions]{.mark}**]{.underline} within these countries. It becomes
possible because [Baltic States have a significant Russian
minority]{.underline} (Best, 2013). Russia is also fully engaged in
spreading false information about the possible revision of various
treaties between the Baltic States and Russia (Matthews, 2020) up to
revoking the recognition of Lithuanian independence (Labanauskas, 2022).
[[Baltic States]{.mark} also [have been a subject of]{.mark} various
**[cyber-attacks]{.mark}** from Russian based hackers [and]{.mark} are
[expect]{.mark}ed to experience **even [more
sophisticated]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[cyber-warfare]{.underline}]{.mark} activities it [[in a foreseeable
future]{.underline}]{.mark} (Mälksoo, 2018). The position of Baltic
States as a frontline in a cyber-warfare was acknowledged also by NATO
by a decision to establish its cooperative cyber-defense competence
centre of excellence in one of the Baltic States -- Estonia (Kovács,
2018). In this study the follow the definition of disinformation
presented by Bayer et al. (2019). It covers the spreading of information
which is designed to be false or manipulated or misleading. It also has
the intention of generating insecurity, tearing cohesion or inciting
hostility, or directly to disrupt democratic processes (Bayer et al.,
2019, p. 18). [Although]{.underline} in recent years, [Russian
disinformation reached the level of]{.underline} "**[strategic
information operations]{.underline}**" (Flanagan et al., 2019), [there
have been very few studies on the **actual effect**]{.underline} of such
disinformation. Completed studies were based on qualitative evaluations
(Surowiec, 2017), focused on Western countries (Carter & Carter, 2021),
or investigated only specific issues -- mostly the Russia-Ukraine
dispute (Gerber & Zavisca, 2016). Therefore, the present paper aims to
evaluate the effect of Russian disinformation on the Baltic States. In
order to assess the latent variables related to the effect of
disinformation activities on citizens' minds, this paper uses the
structural equation modeling method (SEM), in which a partial least
squares technique is employed. To our knowledge, [[this is the]{.mark}
**[first study]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[on the effect of
disinfo]{.mark}rmation on the target countries' populations
[using]{.mark} **[sophisticated]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[statistical
methods]{.underline}]{.mark}. The study consists of several parts: the
introductory section provides a brief overview of the aims and impact of
Russian disinformation in the Baltics, the "Materials and Methods"
section introduces the research model and the hypotheses for the study,
and the main results are presented in the "Results" section. Finally,
the "Conclusions and Discussion" section summarizes the insights of the
study, juxtaposes it with the prevailing theoretical streams, and offers
directions for future studies in the subject area. Theoretical
background There is increasing debate about the socio-political
consequences of negative disinformation. Arguably, [disinformation
enables the success of **populist parties** during election
campaigns]{.underline} (Chernobrov & Briant, 2020) [and affects
**political decisions**]{.underline}, [as politicians are reluctant to
take actions]{.underline} that are potentially [unpopular
with]{.underline} certain [voting groups]{.underline} (Acemoglu et al.,
2013) that could be [subject to]{.underline} various [disinformation
tactics]{.underline} (Van Herpen, 2015). [Prolonged negative
disinformation campaigns lower **public participation**]{.underline}
(Bonch-Osmolovskaya, 2015) [through both increased perception of
**negligibility**]{.underline} of voters actions (Van Herpen, 2015) [and
increased **apathy**]{.underline} (Gulenko, 2021). [In recent years, the
intensity of Russian disinformation has **substantially
increased**]{.underline}, especially on social media (Prier, 2020). [One
of the main aims]{.underline} of destructive Russian disinformation,
which has intensified since 2014, [is to discredit national authorities
by questioning the independence of their actions or
decisions]{.underline} (Lelich, 2014). This leitmotif of the "other hand
ruling the government" has also been applied through information warfare
against another post-soviet country -- Ukraine -- and is considered to
be highly effective (Karlsen, 2016). It also increases citizens'
perception of hostility with respect to the surrounding environment and
diminishes their participation in public life and socio-economic
activity (Irisova, 2015). Furthermore, Russian disinformation in
post-Soviet states boosts nihilism to substantially undermine the
economic activity of their populations, especially with respect to
future gains (Julukhidze, 2020). Nihilism as a result of increased
distrust provoked by Russian disinformation is mentioned by Paul and
Matthews (2019), and Russian disinformation objectives to create and
facilitate distrust in Government were also noticed by Sanovich (2017).
Disinformation also violates the self-identity and perception of justice
(Blouin & Mukand, 2019). Reflections on the exaggerated perception of
corruption within the state apparatus were found to be one of the most
discussed topics (Miller, 2019). The emphasized narrative of the "failed
state" in which everything is decided in advance, and in which citizens
can neither influence policy decisions nor be the masters of their own
personal or career development, is also important for Russian
disinformation architects (Helmus et al., 2018). The
disinformation-related influence of diminished motivation for positive,
personal development has also been mentioned by Smith and Lasswell
(2015). [Attempting to undermine the perception of safety within the
country through constant intimidation and threat of imminent military
actions is a]{.underline}nother [major tactical aspect of Russian
disinformation]{.underline} (Giles et al., 2015). Although in the short
term, the effect may be opposite to that expected by the disinformation
designers -- a consolidation of the nation in the face of immediate
aggression (Yurkova, 2018), in the long term, [it rewards the
disinformation creators in the form of decreased trust in public
institutions]{.underline} (Haas, 2017) and the state itself (Redley,
2007) in the target country. Such dual effects of disinformation not
only increase the complexity of how it may be detected, (Kausar et al.,
2020) but also make understanding its effects even more puzzling. It has
been noted that although Russian state disinformation is very effective
within Russia itself by forcing the Russian population to accept a
distorted reality, it becomes a counterproductive element outside
Russian borders (Belousov, 2012) where it no longer achieves its main
objectives (Benkler et al., 2018). These contradictions not only
substantiate polemics about the ambiguity of Russian disinformation
outcomes but also add weight to arguments in favor of the present study.
In summary, Russian disinformation in the Baltic States is directed at
increasing the populations" distrust in their governments (Lough et al.,
2014), promoting the perception of a lack of justice (Paul & Matthews,
2016) or career possibilities (Kuczyńska-Zonik, 2017) within the
country, and reinforcing the threat of the imminent military action in
the region (Buinauskas et al., 2016).

[[We're Focused on Ukraine But Look Out For the **Russian Threat to the
Baltics**]{.underline}]{.mark}: It was a shot heard around the world in
the Russian military analysis community. A RAND Corporation simulated
wargame in 2016 concluded that the Russian military could reach the
suburbs of the Estonian and Latvian capitals of Tallinn and Riga in less
than 60 hours. In the iterations of the exercise, the Estonians and
Latvians would need at least seven brigades of troops that include at
least three armored brigades to potentially fight the Russians to a
standstill.

But it gets worse from here. In another RAND wargame in 2019, the
players examined if NATO and Russia would use tactical nuclear weapons
during a simulated war in the Baltic states (Estonia, Latvia, and
Lithuania). The scenario also had Russian conventional forces
over-running capitals in the Balkans and NATO having the last fail-safe
option to use non-strategic nuclear weapons.

What Type of Warfare Could the Russians Use Against the Baltics?

A widespread fear is that [[the Kremlin could use hybrid
warfare]{.underline}]{.mark} (conventional and unconventional aspects of
power projection) [again [to annex parts of the
Baltics]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [which would **trigger Article V** with
NATO allies]{.underline}]{.mark} and would require a military response
against the Russians from NATO members. A glance at a map will tell you
that St. Petersburg is dangerously close to Tallinn, Estonia and Riga,
Latvia. But according to General Valery Gerasimov, the Chief of the
General Staff of the Armed Forces of Russia, [the distinctions between
offensive aspects of war and defensive aspects of war are
blurring.]{.underline}

Under this Gerasimov Doctrine, [[the Kremlin then could engineer a
Russian]{.mark} hybrid [incursion]{.mark} of cyber and [**information
warfare attacks** against the Baltics]{.mark}, and [these tactics could
be]{.mark} made to be [seen as a defensive
operation.]{.mark}]{.underline} Since the Baltics have ethnic Russians
as part of the population, [[Moscow could employ special operations
forces]{.mark} as peacekeepers [to protect
compatriots.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[This could happen with an
information warfare campaign that would increase]{.mark} the chances for
[protest]{.mark} and other domestic unrest [with ethnic Russians as
victims]{.mark} in the Baltics. [Then a hybrid operation would ensue to
protect ethnic Russians.]{.mark}]{.underline}

According to the two RAND sets of wargames, [[the Russians would then
bring in the]{.mark} heavy armored and mechanized [infantry]{.mark}
units [to "**teach the Baltics a lesson**."]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[Hybrid war]{.underline}]{.mark}fare [is]{.underline} roughly defined
as '[grey area' warfare]{.underline}, which often exists just beneath
the threshold of armed conflict. [It]{.underline} is designed to
[[erode]{.underline}]{.mark} public [[confidence in]{.underline}]{.mark}
civil [society and **[democratic foundations]{.mark}**, primarily
[through **cyber attacks on c**]{.mark}**ritical
[i]{.mark}nfrastructure**]{.underline}, including energy, or targeted
disinformation methods. In this regard, it poses a potential threat to
sovereignty, as it gives nations, terrorist organisations and criminal
actors relative anonymity via a low-cost, high-yield method to influence
the politics and policies of other states.

[[Russia is]{.mark} one of [the most active perpetrator]{.mark}s of
hybrid warfare]{.underline} and implemented it most effectively in its
2014 illegal annexation of Crimea. [[The Kremlin continues]{.mark} to
use it today]{.underline}, notably [in some countries [to]{.mark}

have the potential to [disrupt]{.mark} the [NATO]{.mark}'s political and
military effectiveness and [cohesion]{.mark}**. It will take time and
effort to counter these threats]{.underline}, if the Alliance is to
address dependencies among its members and act as a platform to build a
common picture of complex operational risk and vulnerabilities.

Energy sector increasingly targeted

The use of hybrid warfare is growing. [[The]{.mark} past [decade]{.mark}
has [seen a **dramatic increase** in hybrid threats]{.mark}
worldwide]{.underline}: from cyber attacks to disinformation campaigns
to covert military operations. [[Threats are]{.mark} becoming [more
frequent, complex, destructive and coercive]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
broader economic and security ramifications of hybrid warfare are
evident, especially when applied to the energy sector.

Russia has deployed a range of hybrid threats against the energy assets,
policies or supplies of NATO Allies, as well as other countries. It has
used political and economic leverage, combined with disinformation
campaigns, against Bulgaria and Romania to undermine efforts to reduce
their dependence on Russian energy sources. Supply disruptions have been
used in the past as well, most famously in the case of Ukraine in 2009,
the Baltic states before that and, more recently, against Bulgaria.

Russia has also used its economic clout, combined with political
influence, to advance its energy agenda, in Hungary, where the expansion
of the Paks Nuclear Power Plant is now underway using Russian energy
technology. Likewise, in Germany, Russia has used its commercial and
political ties, as well as other suspected malign influence, to advance
the controversial €12 billion Nord Stream II pipeline, now nearing
completion. Moreover, in 2020, a suspected Russian group, Berserk Bear
APT, launched cyber attacks against German energy companies, and has
been implicated in previous cyber attacks against German utilities in
2018.

[Russian-backed cyber attacks against energy]{.underline} assets [have
also been identified in a number of other Alliance members]{.underline},
including Poland, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States. In
some instances, [those cyber campaigns have run concurrent with other
hybrid threats against energy assets, like malign influence efforts and
**natural gas supply cutbacks**]{.underline}. Taken together, it is
clear that -- over the past decade and with increasing vigour --
**[[Russia has been pursuing a]{.mark} concerted hybrid [campaign aimed
at undermining the Alliance's energy security]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

Over the same period, among NATO's partner countries, **[Russia's hybrid
campaign has been most evident in Ukraine]{.underline}**, combining
supply disruptions, cyber attacks, economic and political influence, and
disinformation efforts to undermine the country's energy security and
sow political instability. The most disruptive effort was Russia's 2009
interruption of natural gas supplies, but the attacks have continued and
become increasingly complex and coercive.

A notable example is the December 2015 Black Energy cyber attack on the
western Ukrainian power station, which shut down power for nearly a
quarter million residents over a six hour period. This was followed, a
year later, with a more sophisticated attack on the power grid supplying
electricity to the capital, Kyiv, using CrashOverride/Industroyer
malware. While of shorter duration and scope than the previous attack,
the effort was far more sinister: it was aimed at compromising
electrical safety relays, which are used to protect bulk power
equipment. Had it not been detected by analysts, the final attack phase
could have led to physical destruction of expensive and
difficult-to-replace equipment beyond briefly disrupting power supplies.

Beyond the Euro-Atlantic area, [[Iran]{.mark} and other suspected states
[are]{.mark} currently [waging a c]{.mark}omplex hybrid [campaign
against **Saudi**]{.mark} **Arabia's [energy assets]{.mark}**[.
This]{.mark} campaign [may be illustrative of the future of hybrid
warfare]{.mark}, **particularly [in the domain of energy
security]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Through both covert and overt
military operations, and the use of proxy forces, Iran has repeatedly
disrupted or otherwise struck Saudi energy infrastructure.

The possible collusion of hostile actors in the ongoing Iranian campaign
against Saudi Arabia is of particular concern and may have consequences
for NATO Allies. Specifically, the 2017 cyber attack on the Petro Rabigh
complex, which resulted in a costly shutdown and forensic clean-up of
the facility and very nearly resulted in an uncontrolled gas release and
explosion. [Despite initial speculation that Iran was uniquely
responsible for the dangerous Triton malware used in the attack, the
United States has since concluded that the malware was developed by
Russia and imposed sanctions on the research institution connected with
its development.]{.underline} The malware has also been implicated in
attacks on energy companies in the United States.

[Other suspected measures in Iran's campaign include two drone strikes
by Iran's Houthi allies on Saudi refineries, covert attacks on two Saudi
registered oil tankers in the Persian Gulf and, most recently, attacks
on two foreign-flagged tankers at Saudi ports on the Red
Sea]{.underline}. Notably, the drone strike on the Saudi Aramco Abqaiq
refinery in late 2019, which was claimed by Houthi forces, provided Iran
with deniability and helped expose air defence weaknesses in Saudi
Arabia.

#### CI -- extinction.

DOA: 7-20-2022 //ArchanSen\]

Should the acronym WMD, which stands for "Weapons of Mass Destruction,"
be updated to "Weapons of Mass Disruption?" I think it is a timely
question in this Digital Age as we connect and integrate billions of new
digital devices into our lives and business processes and when a
cyber-attack against one supply chain provider can lead to cascading
effects on entire communities across the globe. [[Cyberattacks
on]{.underline}]{.mark} Critical Infrastructure
([[CI]{.underline}]{.mark}) **[can [cause mass]{.mark} economic and
societal [impacts]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Fewer strategies]{.underline}
than cyber-attacks can [offer better plausible deniability and can cause
greater anxiety and instability to our society than targeting the
systems and networks that enable our day-to-day activitie]{.underline}s.
Consider that 20 years ago terrorists killed 3,000 Americans and
disrupted the entire U.S. and global economies with only four planes.
[[Given the growth]{.mark} and ubiquity [of tech]{.mark}nology today [we
must consider]{.mark} how **[the exponential growth of cyberattacks on
CI might]{.mark} be similarly leveraged by adversaries and criminal
actors [as]{.mark}**]{.underline} Weapons of Mass Disruption, the new
**[[WMD]{.underline}]{.mark}**.\[1\]

[Cyberattacks take many forms]{.underline}, often **[progressing through
multiple phases as they escalate in severity]{.underline}**. [Malicious
actors often initiate a network intrusion through phishing campaigns or
the purchase of compromised user credentials on the dark
web.]{.underline} What begins as the hijack of a single user profile
expands in severity. Intruders move laterally across internal systems,
conducting surveillance and gathering intelligence on network
environments before escalating to data theft, service disruptions, and
ransomware extortion.

The goals of these actors may be both strategic and economic in nature,
and targets may be government and/or the private sector. Cyberattacks
perpetrated on CI elements develop into the new WMD when the intended
and unintended consequences cause widespread damage and societal
impacts. [[A disruption of essential services, even if brief]{.mark},
**can [occupy significant]{.mark} civilian and [military
resources]{.mark}** in a region or entire country]{.underline}.\[2\]

#### Specifically, Lithuania facing onslaught of intense Russian hacks

Theory at the London School of Economics, and has been awarded the Ben
Pimlott Prize for Political Writing by the Guardian and The Fabian
Society. Rowland is Technology correspondent, reporting on the many
areas tech is transforming lives. "Could the Russian cyber attack on
Lithuania draw a military response from NATO?",
https://news.sky.com/story/could-the-russian-cyber-attack-on-lithuania-draw-a-military-response-from-nato-12641986)LR

[**A NATO member is under attack.** The NATO member in question is the
Baltic state of **Lithuania**, which was **targeted on Monday by Russian
hackers.**]{.underline} According to the hackers, [the attack is still
going on. Transport and media websites have been hit, as have the
websites of various state institutions such as the Lithuanian tax
service, which had to pause its operations yesterday.]{.underline} A
Russian hacker group known as [Killnet claimed responsibility for the
attacks, claiming on its Telegram channel that the attack was
retaliation for Lithuania\'s decision to stop the transit of some goods
to the Russian territory of Kaliningrad on the Baltic
coast.]{.underline} The politics of this situation are extremely
complicated. Kaliningrad is Russian-owned, but it isn\'t connected to
the main body of Russia - it\'s a small piece of Russia surrounded by
NATO countries. [The Lithuanian government says it is simply enforcing
European Union sanctions on goods, but Russia has responded with
outrage, saying it is being stopped from accessing its sovereign
territory**. Russia promised to respond** in a way **that would \"have a
serious negative impact on the population of Lithuania\"**. Then, a
**few days later, came this cyber attack**]{.underline}. Does that mean
Russia attacked a NATO member? Not so fast. For a start, [the group that
claimed responsibility denies any connection to the Russian state,
saying it is \"not affiliated with any law enforcement authorities\".
The Russian government has long used third-party criminal groups to
conduct hacks and cyber attacks, so it would not come as a surprise if
it was involved.]{.underline} Nevertheless, on the surface at least, its
hands are clean. Then there\'s the nature of the attack. [Reports so far
suggest that it\'s a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack, a
crude attack which involves throwing huge amounts of traffic at a
website until it is forced offline.]{.underline} The attack has been
described as \"massive\", which is technically true, because in order to
work a DDoS attack has to be large, but that doesn\'t mean it will have
a massive effect. DDoS attacks are so common that most websites nowadays
have protection against them as standard. Even if an attack does work,
it won\'t steal any data. It\'s a blunt force instrument, little more.
Yet that does not mean we aren\'t moving towards that point, nor that a
cyber attack cannot lead us there. Another way in which cyber attacks
are different to physical attacks is that once they are started they can
spiral out of control. Unlike a bomb or a bullet, a virus can spread in
ways that even its makers don\'t intend. Almost exactly five years ago,
the costliest ever cyber attack was launched: a malware attack called
Not Petya. It is believed to have begun when Russian operatives infected
a small piece of Ukrainian accounting software, intending to disrupt
Ukrainian businesses. But from there it spread to companies around the
world, including shipping giant Maersk and food conglomerate Mondelez.
By the time it was done, Not Petya had caused \$10bn in estimated
damages.

Al Jazeera: **[Russia has said Lithuanian citizens will "feel the pain"
over Kaliningrad.]{.underline}** How might Moscow respond? Grigas:
Russia could enact its own sanctions on the sale of goods to Lithuania.
The key Russian exports are oil and gas, and electricity, and Lithuania
has already made a decision much earlier before this conflict, that it
will not be purchasing any Russian energy sources. There could be a
question of fertilisers and other elements but there is already a broad
blanket of European sanctions against Russian goods. I view Russia's
statements more as threats and posturing for the Russian domestic
audience because a lot of \[Russian President Vladimir\] Putin's
statements tend to be aimed to show the resolve and the strength of the
Kremlin, rather than necessarily specifying any sort of actions they
would take or for the external audience. [What is concerning is that
**Russia used or the Kremlin use the terms that Lithuania has enacted a
blockade,** either the word choice is important, because blockade could
be **perceived as a military already action,** and therefore, **Russia
could try to**, you know, **justify some sort of \[military action\], as
well."**]{.underline} Al Jazeera: [How do you think the Kaliningrad
situation can impact the war in Ukraine?]{.underline} Grigas: I think
this situation in [Kaliningrad will show whether Russia is willing to
escalate further this conflict against the West, the European Union and
NATO.]{.underline} Al Jazeera: [The United States has said that it will
stand behind Lithuania and its NATO commitments to defend
it]{.underline} ... Grigas: NATO, the United States and European Union
countries have been very cautious not to get involved in this war.
[There's a **real fear of potential escalation** of conflict with Russia
directly **because one, Russia remains a nuclear state**.]{.underline}
[Second, because of the fact that it's controlled essentially by a
single man with a very small circle of advisers, who **has essentially a
free hand to take whatever decisions he may wish**.]{.underline} Al
Jazeera: Lithuania and Russia already had weak diplomatic relations, and
the war in Ukraine has worsened them. How will their ties be affected by
the ban? Grigas: Lithuania has been a very vocal supporter of Ukraine
since the very start of the war this February and, frankly, since
Russia's occupation of Crimea \[in 2014\] and the initial invasion of
the Donbas. Earlier this summer, Russia and Duma deputies were
discussing whether they should revoke Lithuania's independence that was
agreed to by the Soviet Union in 1991. This is part of kind of a broader
package of the Kremlin's threats on a smaller neighbouring country. I
don't think Lithuanian-Russian relations will improve in the near
future. Frankly, European and Russian relations will not improve in the
near future, nor will NATO and Russian relations, particularly as long
as the ongoing war in Ukraine continues.

#### Baltic State Utility to US

**Banka 2022**, (Andris Banka , Journal of Transatlantic Studies volume
20, pages161--183 (2022), Published 4/5/2022 "Neither reckless nor
free-riders: auditing the Baltics as US treaty allies"
https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s42738-022-00096-3)

A great deal of scholarly literature has treated Baltic States' physical
proximity to Russia as their Achilles heel. The conventional wisdom
holds that due to the force imbalance in the region, which heavily
favours the Russian side, Baltic republics are hard to defend
territories.Footnote82 While this assumption is certainly valid, there
is, however, a flip side to this predicament[. Situated at a
geopolitical crossroads, these small nations are in an advantageous
position to produce valuable insights into Kremlin's statecraft. As
James Carafano suggests: "To a major power, a country's greatest asset
might be its map coordinates rather than the size of its arsenal or bank
account".Footnote83 Similarly, Brands and Feaver have noted that some of
the most valued US intelligence assets stem from allied partners
"geographical capability" and "proximity to the theater of
interest]{.underline}".Footnote84 Lacking in material power resources,
the Baltic States, within the past decade, have made a concerted effort
to set up "knowledge hubs" that excel in analysing their much larger
eastern neighbour. [Having been subjected to Russian-directed gray zone
tactics for decades, the Baltics have amassed valuable regional
expertise. Testifying before the US Committee on Foreign Affairs, a
prominent Russia-observer explained: "They \[the Baltics\] see things
that we don't see. They can go to places that we don't go. They
understand things that we don't in cyber and
intelligence".]{.underline}Footnote85 Retired Lieutenant General Ben
Hodges, who commanded the US Army Europe, concurs by emphasizing that
the Baltic republics, due to their location, "know more what is
happening in Russia, than any American will ever know".[Footnote86
Indeed, the Baltics fill in critical gaps in fields such as
cyberwarfare, intelligence gathering, and disinformation, actively
sharing this "know-how" with their US counterparts. The following
details such contributions The Republic of Estonia was the first known
victim of a state-directed cyberattack]{.underline}. The 2007 incident,
widely attributed to the Russian Federation, for weeks incapacitated
Estonian governmental structures. Somewhat paradoxically, in the long
run, the event turned out to have a positive impact as it propelled the
nation of 1.3 million people to treat the cyber domain as an intricate
part of its national security. [Subsequently, the country set up the
Tallinn-based NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence.
According to the Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid, this was a smart
way for a small country to demonstrate its contributions to
allies.Footnote87 Understanding that it has little to offer in
hard-power deliverables, Estonian leadership chose instead to focus on
the cyber domain]{.underline}. In the words of Kaljulaid's predecessor,
Toomas Ilves, the IT field served as "the great equalizer", allowing a
small nation to contribute considerably more than one "would expect by
looking at the map, population, and GDP per capita".Footnote88 [Today,
Estonia has a well-established reputation among its peers as the lead
authority for devising cybersecurity-related solutions. When it comes to
countering cyber threats, Tallinn and Washington have forged a close
bilateral relationship on various departmental levels.]{.underline} In
2020, the two governments set up a joint cyber-threat
intelligence-sharing platform.Footnote89 In addition, the US Army and
Estonia's Ministry of Defence entered into an agreement for
collaborative research on cyber defence matters.Footnote90 Such joint
initiatives have already borne fruit. In the run-up to the 2020 US
Presidential election, in order to learn more about Russian hacking
methods, the USA dispatched its cyber force operatives to
Estonia.Footnote91 For the USA, this allowed to observe the work of
Kremlin-linked agents and bolster its own election defences. Commenting
on this deployment, US Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Cyber
Policy pointed out: "Cyber is a team sport---when it comes to halting
threats from cyberspace, no one can go it alone".Footnote92 Such
operations illustrate how small states can amplify the reach of the USA
and effectively complement its capabilities. [Estonian authorities have
regularly received praise for the provision of such
services]{.underline}. James Mattis, US Secretary of Defense in the
Trump administration, upon meeting his Estonian counterpart underscored
that Washington highly appreciates Estonian leadership in this new area
of competition, and that its positive example speaks to the fact that
the size of the country does not necessarily determine its contributions
to collective security.Footnote93 In a similar vein, NATO
Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg has spoken highly of Estonia for its
efforts in training and educating NATO military staff.Footnote94 After
being the first victim of a Russian-linked cyberattack, Estonian
leadership managed to turn the incident into a certain asset. By
studying its lessons and building resilience, it gradually emerged as
the lead cyber-knowledge exporter. [For many, Russia's abilities to
effectively plant disinformation campaigns overseas came into sharper
focus during the 2016 US presidential election. For the Baltics,
however, such malign interference and attempts to sow societal divisions
were hardly anything new.]{.underline} Lawmakers in the region have been
sounding the alarm about it ever since regaining independence in the
early 1990s. [However, it was only in 2014 that Latvia opened the NATO
Centre of Excellence devoted to the exploration of such issues. Its
central analytical focus is on tracking and analysing Russia's digital
footprint.]{.underline} Since its establishment, the research
institution has produced innovative studies regarding
information-warfare efforts employed by Kremlin-linked actors and
experimental takes on societal vulnerabilities. Such analysis has often
been shared with the US government via testimonies before the US Senate
Select Committee on Intelligence and briefings with the US military
staff.Footnote95 Commenting on the centre's work, a senior US
Congressman pointed out that because of their "first-hand experience
with the Soviet Union and Putin's Russia", the Baltics have become "a
valuable source of insight" for the US government.Footnote96

[A new]{.underline} USA Today/Suffolk University [poll found eight in 10
Republicans, Democrats and independents are worried about]{.underline}
the future of American [democracy]{.underline}. But they disagree over
the causes -- and who's to blame: 85% of Democrats call the Capitol Hill
rioters "criminals"; two-thirds of Republicans believe "they went too
far but had a point".

"Only free and fair elections in which the loser abides by the result
stand between each of us and life at the mercy of a despotic regime,"
warns Harvard law professor Laurence Tribe. But increasingly, for
today's politicians, honourable defeat is a wholly foreign concept.

**[This chronic [loss of institutional trust]{.mark}]{.underline}** and
credibility, also [tainting a politicised]{.underline},
conservative-dominated [supreme court, [reflects a society]{.mark} more
[openly riven by]{.mark} longstanding [cultural]{.mark}]{.underline},
racial and religious [[animosities]{.underline}]{.mark} -- and one in
which income, wealth and health inequalities are growing. [[These
divisions are]{.mark} in turn wilfully [exacerbated by rightwing]{.mark}
broadcast and online media, bloggers and internet
**[trolls]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

A Republican party mostly in thrall to Trump's lies, delusions and
conspiracy theories is creating a world of "alternative facts", says
columnist Thomas Friedman. If they succeed in replacing truth,
"[[America]{.mark} isn't just in trouble. It [is headed for]{.mark} what
scientists call 'an **[extinction]{.mark}-level event'**".]{.underline}

Jedediah Britton-Purdy, a Columbia law professor, is similarly
apocalyptic. "[One thing Democrats and Republicans share is the belief
that, to save the country, the other side must not be allowed to win ...
**[Every election is an existential crisis]{.mark}**,"]{.underline} he
wrote.

"We should stop underestimating the threat facing the country," a grim
New York Times editorial thundered last week. "**[[January 6]{.mark} is
not in the past; it [is every day]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. [It is
regular citizens who threaten election officials]{.underline}]{.mark}[,
who ask 'when can we use the guns?', who vow to murder politicians who
dare to vote their conscience.]{.underline} It is Republican lawmakers
scrambling to make it harder for people to vote and subvert their will
if they do. It is Trump who stokes the flames of conflict."
[Democracy]{.underline}, it said, [was in "grave danger]{.underline}".

Systemic violence that overwhelms conventional politics may be near at
hand. "**[[We are closer to civil war than any of us would like to
believe]{.underline}]{.mark}**," says Barbara Walter, a California
politics professor.

No one is talking about a remake of the 1861-65 US civil war. Instead,
as in Ukraine or Libya, [an "open insurgency",]{.underline} as defined
by Walter, [would]{.underline} probably [involve]{.underline} (at least
initially), [disparate militias and their supporters pursuing forms of
asymmetrical warfare -- typically terrorist acts, bombings,
assassinations, kidnappings.]{.underline} That said, worrying echoes of
Confederate-era secessionism are once again heard in Texas and
elsewhere.

When the warlike rhetoric of Charlottesville-style paramilitary [white
supremacists]{.underline}, the high nationwide incidence of [gun
ownership and]{.underline}, for example, worries about [**[far-right
cells within the]{.mark} US [military]{.mark}** are factored in, [civil
war scenarios do not appear]{.mark} so
[implausible]{.mark}.]{.underline}

"**[[Only a spark is needed, one major domestic terrorist event that
shifts the perception of the country]{.underline}]{.mark}**," analyst
Stephen Marche wrote last week. [[Marche quotes a **military history
professor**]{.mark} and Iraq war veteran, Col Peter Mansoor, who tells
him: "It would not be like the first civil war, with armies manoeuvring
on the battlefield. I think [it would]{.mark} very much [be a
free-for-all]{.mark}, neighbour on neighbour, [based on beliefs and skin
colours]{.mark} and religion. And it would be horrific."]{.underline}

## Modelling Advantage 

#### Scenario one is warming---

#### NATO involvement is key to overcome dependence

https://www.tesadernegi.org/the-energy-security-of-the-baltic-states-and-the-tensions-with-russia.html//DG

The last term applies to the [interconnection between the Baltic States
and Russia]{.underline} as the [Baltics are considered
vulnerable]{.underline} and a trade war could drag them down in a
crisis\[45\]. Since the Baltic market is **[not economically important
to Russia]{.underline}**, the [interdependence is]{.underline}
considered [asymmetrical]{.underline}. Russian exports for the year 2020
to Latvia were 2.23B, Estonia \$2.59B, and Lithuania \$2.39B\[46\].
Nevertheless, from the opening of the Balticconnector and other
interconnections belonging to the [European network]{.underline} the
region [plays an important role]{.underline} in gas and petroleum
transit, ensuring the uninterrupted flow of energy to further European
destinations. Consequently, the Kremlin started to look around for
solutions and has developed a strategy comprising the construction of
alternative routes, namely the Nord Stream 1 and 2, the Turkish Stream
and the Power of Siberia pipelines.

However, the [complex situation must be framed inside a broader
strategic vision]{.underline} according to Keohane's and Nye's
interdependence theory. [Russian weight]{.underline} in the Baltic
energy security [undergoes military security conditions]{.underline}.
The Baltic States are part [of the eastern flank of NATO]{.underline},
therefore their integration into the Russian energy infrastructure is
meant to [balance the presence of the Western military
alliance]{.underline} in the region\[47\]. Moreover, the Baltics
register a high presence of Russian immigrants in their populations,
thus energy is used as a weapon to prevent any kind of discrimination.

The request of the Estonian Defence minister for a [strengthening of
NATO's presence in the Baltics]{.underline} following the outbreak of
the Russian-Ukrainian conflict in 2022 **[reflects well the
interdependence hypothesis]{.underline}**. Estonia, likewise, its
neighbours, fears the extension of the conflict to the area and the
possibility of retaliation in the energy sector, as the country has
engaged itself actively in the reception of war refugees from
Ukraine\[48\]. According to the Bank of Estonia, the [outbreak of war
has influenced markets, prices of natural gas and electricity are
increasing]{.underline}, and households' consumption is expected to
reduce in the short term. Therefore, the Estonian government decided to
place natural gas and heating under a price ceiling until spring
2022\[49\]. Lithuania on its side is bringing forward the GIPL project
with Poland and is looking forward to opening the pipeline ahead of
schedule, on May 1st. The three **[countries foresee closer regional and
European cooperation to reduce their dependence.]{.underline}**

In [the past, Russia could benefit from the European
uncertainty]{.underline} due to the different levels of European
involvement in the matter and the controversy in the support of stronger
sanctions. But a [comprehensive energy network has been
developed]{.underline} in the past twenty years and now the European
Union presents itself as a single and active actor in the international
environment, that stands for the democratic values and is ready to
defend itself against external claims of special interest zones in the
former Soviet space\[50\]. For the Baltic States, this means knowing
that they can fully lean on Western support in asserting their own
sovereignty.

Therefore, to reinforce its self-determination, the European Union
launched the REPower plan in March 2022, aiming at **[phasing out the
fossil fuels import dependence from Russia]{.underline}**. The strategy
requires the almost complete filling up of the capacity gas stock
storage before winter, the replacement of gas in heating and power
generation and more renewables investments\[51\].

#### Baltic renewables k2 european green energy transition

Excellence \"The untapped green energy potential of the Baltic States,\"
euractiv,
https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy/opinion/the-untapped-green-energy-potential-of-the-baltic-states//DG

As the [global energy transition gathers speed]{.underline}, the
[Baltics may not seem like its obvious frontrunners]{.underline}.
Despite making great strides in making their energy systems cleaner,
**[fossil fuels still remain a staple]{.underline}** of their energy
diet. However, growing evidence suggests that the Baltics have a
**[massive offshore wind energy potential]{.underline}**, which could
have a **[game-changing effect]{.underline}** for the entire region.
Chances are, wind turbines could not only propel the Baltics to the
forefront of the energy transition, but also to the ranks of clean
energy exporters. As things stand, few would argue that the [Baltics are
on the cutting edge of the clean energy transition]{.underline}. Like
most of their European peers, they get the bulk of their energy from
fossil fuels such as oil and natural gas. These are either imported from
far abroad or, as is the case with Estonian oil shale, mined from deep
underground. Meanwhile, renewables such as onshore wind, solar or
hydropower still account for a tiny fraction of their overall energy
needs. In 2019, these energy sources met some 2.6 percent
of [Lithuania](https://www.iea.org/countries/lithuania)'s, 4.6 percent
of [Latvia](https://www.iea.org/countries/latvia)'s and 1.3 percent
of [Estonia](https://www.iea.org/countries/estonia)'s total primary
energy demand. Granted, the overall share of renewables is vastly
greater once biomass is added into the mix. Yet, some
scientists [argue](https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/publication/eur-scientific-and-technical-research-reports/use-woody-biomass-energy-production-eu) that
fuels such as firewood or wood pellets may not be the most
environmentally sustainable sources of energy. However, **[what the
Baltics lack in fossil fuels, they make up for with an abundance of
wind]{.underline}** in the Baltic Sea, which can be harnessed and
converted into electricity. Though [currently none of the Baltics have
any windmills]{.underline} in the open seas, all three have major
offshore wind plans for the future. Lithuania, for example, intends
to [have](https://enmin.lrv.lt/en/news/offshore-wind-another-direction-of-renewable-energy-to-strengthen-local-power-generation-in-lithuania) at
least 700 megawatt (MW) of offshore wind farms in operation by 2030.
Latvia and Estonia are also eying to co-develop
a [joint](https://www.windpowermonthly.com/article/1690879/estonia-latvia-sign-pact-1gw-offshore-wind-farm) 1,000
MW wind farm in the Gulf of Riga. On top of that,
Estonia [wants](https://news.err.ee/1149566/dutch-company-van-oord-buys-stake-in-saare-wind-energy) to
have a 1,000 MW offshore wind park near the island of Saarema by 2028,
in addition to a slew of other projects that are
under [consideration](https://www.windpowermonthly.com/article/1690879/estonia-latvia-sign-pact-1gw-offshore-wind-farm).All
of this sounds great, but it could just be the beginning. According to a
recent
WindEurope [study](https://windeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/files/about-wind/reports/WindEurope-Our-Energy-Our-Future.pdf),
the B[altic Sea could be the next big thing for Europe's energy
transition]{.underline}. It is estimated that
Lithuania [could](https://windeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/files/about-wind/reports/WindEurope-Our-Energy-Our-Future.pdf) have
up to 3,600 MW, Latvia up to 2,900 MW and Estonia up to 1,500 MW of
offshore windfarms by 2050. If this generation capacity could be met,
the study claims that the Baltics could
potentially [export](https://windeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/files/about-wind/reports/WindEurope-Our-Energy-Our-Future.pdf) around
half of their offshore wind electricity to neighboring states.
Obviously, it is difficult to say with certainty just how much
electricity would the [Baltics be able to export]{.underline} and others
would like to import. After all, to get to a zero-carbon future, the
Baltics and their **[neighbors will have
to [undergo](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/04/can-electricity-decarbonize-the-energy-sector/) tremendous
changes by 2050]{.underline}**. Not only will they have to **[make
energy use more efficient]{.underline}**, but they will also have to
d[ecarbonize and electrify large portions of their
economies]{.underline}. Still, if the Baltics would harness their full
offshore wind potential and would continue to develop other renewable
sources of energy, there are few doubts that a good chunk of their
electricity might still be available for export. To get more bang for
the buck, the Baltics could also take some of this newfound electricity
and transform it into green hydrogen using a process known as
electrolysis. Green hydrogen could be u[sed for manufacturing,
transport, heating
or [converted](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/solar-and-wind-power-could-ignite-a-hydrogen-energy-comeback/) back
into electricity to back up the grid]{.underline}. Or it could simply be
exported to neighbouring states. This step would [prevent excess
electricity from being wasted and also help decarbonise]{.underline}
those sectors of the economy where electrification is difficult.

#### European transition checks warming\-\--else, all other renewables fail

**EEA,** European Environment Agency 8-1-**2017**, \"Energy and climate
change,\" European Environment Agency,
https://www.eea.europa.eu/signals/signals-2017/articles/energy-and-climate-change//DG

The global [climate is changing]{.underline} and that is [posing
increasingly severe risks for ecosystems, human health and the
economy]{.underline}. The EEA's recent assessment '[Climate change,
impacts and vulnerability in Europe
2016](http://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/climate-change-impacts-and-vulnerability-2016)' shows
that Europe's regions, too, are already facing [impacts of a changing
climate, including rising sea levels, more extreme weather, flooding,
droughts and storms]{.underline}.

These changes are happening because large amounts of [greenhouse gases
are released]{.underline} into the atmosphere [as a result
of]{.underline} many human activities worldwide, including, [most
importantly, burning fossil fuels for electricity
generation]{.underline}, heating and transport. Combustion of fossil
fuels also releases air pollutants that harm the environment and human
health.

Globally, the use of **[energy represents by far the largest source of
greenhouse gas emissions]{.underline}** from human activities.
About [two thirds of global greenhouse gas
emissions](http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/CO2EmissionsfromFuelCombustion_Highlights_2016.pdf) are
linked to burning fossil fuels for energy to be used for heating,
electricity, transport and industry. In Europe, too, the energy
processes are the largest emitter of greenhouse gases, being responsible
for 78 % of total EU emissions in 2015.

Our use and production of energy have a massive impact on the climate
and the converse is also increasingly true. **[Climate change can alter
our energy generation potential]{.underline}** and energy needs. For
example, [changes to the water cycle have an impact on hydropower, and
warmer temperatures increase the energy demand for cooling]{.underline}
in the summer, while decreasing the demand for heating in the winter.

Global efforts so far to mitigate climate change culminated in
the [[Paris
Agreement]{.underline}](http://unfccc.int/paris_agreement/items/9485.php) in
2015. Through the agreement, 195 countries adopted the first-ever
universal and legally binding, global climate deal. The target of the
agreement --- limiting the global average temperature rise to well below
2 °C, while aiming to limit the increase to 1.5 °C --- is ambitious and
**[cannot be achieved without a major overhaul of global energy
production]{.underline}** and consumption. 

To support the global climate agenda, the [EU has adopted]{.underline}
binding climate and energy targets for 2020 and [proposed targets for
2030]{.underline} as part of its overall efforts to move to a low-carbon
economy and to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 80-95 % by 2050. The
first set of climate and energy targets for 2020 includes a 20 % cut in
greenhouse gas emissions (compared with 1990 levels), 20 % of energy
consumption coming from renewables and a 20 % improvement in energy
efficiency. Based on the current proposals in discussion in EU
institutions, the next milestone of 2030 pushes these targets to a 40 %
cut in emissions, [27 % of energy coming from renewable
sources]{.underline} and a 27 % improvement in energy efficiency (or
30 %, as recently proposed by the European Commission) compared with
baseline.

While some scientists started raising concerns about the burning of
fossil fuels eventually warming the Earth's atmosphere as far back as
the middle 20th century, [a consensus among scientists that global
warming is a problem we have to address didn't form until the later part
of the 20th century.]{.underline} Now that [we're progressing through
the 21st century, why are some in scientific circles raising concerns
about our near-term survival as a species? In recent years, the effects
of global warming have become exceedingly extreme.]{.underline} In fact,
[from record-breaking heatwaves to unprecedented forest fires to melting
polar ice sheets, the effects of global warming are occurring faster
than the scientific community had projected they would just a decade or
two ago. The concern about our viability as a species on Earth is due to
the fast-developing effects of global warming.]{.underline} If we don't
address the causes of global warming or take mitigative actions, [it
could transform into [runaway]{.mark} global [warming]{.mark} that would
[heat up]{.mark} the [Earth]{.mark} so [rapidly]{.mark} that humans and
many other species will likely be imperiled. Many [scientists wrongly
had confidence that \[hu\]mankind would come to its senses]{.mark} when
faced with the stark reality that our survival as a species is
threatened and we'd collectively take actions to avert catastrophic
global warming by discontinuing our burning of fossil fuels and
replacing them with renewable non-carbon energy sources.
[However]{.mark}, despite some tepid efforts to cut carbon
emissions]{.underline}, such as the 2016 Paris Agreement, it appears
that [[due to]{.mark} a combination of ignorance and a concerted effort
by [the fossil fuels industry]{.mark} to [stop any efforts to move away
from carbon-based products, **we will**]{.mark} **likely [not
address]{.mark} our continuing release of global [warming]{.mark} gases
into Earth's atmosphere [until it's too late]{.mark}** and the global
warming we've experienced in recent decades transforms into
**irreversible and catastrophic runaway global warming.**]{.underline}
This will occur because [human-caused global [warming will]{.mark}
eventually [trigger]{.mark} natural climate warming **[feedback
loops]{.mark}** to take over.]{.underline} At that point, [global
[warming will be]{.mark} like [an **unstoppable runaway train**]{.mark},
as the Earth's atmospheric temperatures rise to life-threatening
levels.]{.underline} These [warming feedback loops include such things
as **releases of global warming gases** from **melting polar ice
sheets** and from **frozen methane deposits** beneath the oceans, as
well as the **loss of polar ice** causing the Earth to **absorb more of
the sun's heat energy**. All of which will cause additional warming,
which then results in additional releases of global warming gases that
will cause additional global temperature rises in an unstoppable loop
that will continue until the planet is warmer than it has been in many
millions of years]{.underline} (long before humans existed). Such rapid
and uncontrollable warming of Earth's atmosphere could warm the planet
by 4 to 5 degrees Celsius (7 to 9 degrees Fahrenheit) within the current
century and perhaps eventually lead to a planet that is 8 to 9 degrees
Celsius (14 to 16 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than it was before humans
started burning fossil fuels in large quantities starting in the 19th
century. Some might wonder, what's the big deal if the planet is 4 to 5
degrees Celsius or even 8 to 9 degrees Celsius warmer than it has been
as humans evolved on Earth? After all, many parts of the planet
routinely experience temperature swings of this magnitude on a daily or
weekly basis. There are several ways that rapid global warming on a
planetary scale could threaten human survival. [[Warming]{.mark} is not
evenly distributed. Some areas, including currently farmable land, will
warm well in excess of the global average, which would [lead to
**desertification**]{.mark} and crop failures. This would obviously
imperial humans due to massive **[food shortages]{.mark}**. Oceans,
another major source of food that humans need to survive, are impacted
by rising global temperatures, as higher ocean temperatures lead to
acidification of ocean water, which will eventually lead to massive
[die-offs of sea life]{.mark} that provide much-needed food for humans.
Water resources will **completely dry up** in many arid parts of the
world, making those areas uninhabitable. Dwindling food and water
resource]{.underline}s will inevitably lead to [wars between competing
nations that could be catastrophic. [Humans can't survive]{.mark} at
wet-bulb temperatures [above 35 degrees]{.mark} Celsius (95 degrees
Fahrenheit), even in the shade, as the human body loses its ability to
cool itself off. Higher global temperatures and the higher humidity
levels that will occur with the higher temperatures could make large
parts of the Earth uninhabitable due to wet bulb temperatures that are
lethal.]{.underline} Would Runaway Global Warming Actually Lead to Human
Extinction? It's a very big step go from runaway global warming to the
extinction of all human beings on Earth. Humans possess the intellectual
skills necessary to design and build technologies that can help us adapt
to climate change. We're also able to move to places with more
hospitable climates. However, some scientists are concerned that
[[humans will not have time to adapt to the quick pace of runaway global
warming]{.mark} and some of the impacts will be too harsh for us to
survive. If farmlands and oceans are no longer capable of providing food
for humans, where will we turn to obtain life-sustaining
food?]{.underline} It is possible that humans could migrate towards the
poles and try to farm on land in those areas that is freed up from the
ice. However, [it is unclear if the currently frozen areas in and around
the polar regions will have topsoil suitable for farming. What about
freshwater fish? Unfortunately, freshwater lakes and rivers will also
undergo acidification that will likely wipe out most or all fish species
that can provide humans nourishment.]{.underline} Our only hope might be
some sort of synthetic food that is created in factories using basic
elements (a technology that is certainly viable). There will be [other
life-threatening factors]{.underline} that humans will face in a fast
warming world. [Massive [fire balls from methane]{.mark} releases will
create havoc for humans. These fireballs [will start]{.mark} enormous
[forest fires]{.mark} driven by the warmer and in many places a more
arid world, which will cause turmoil for humans. A lack of freshwater in
areas that undergo desertification [will make survival
impossible]{.mark} in such areas. [Wars over]{.mark} dwindling
[resources]{.mark} will be fought out of desperation and could [end in
catastrophe.]{.mark} The stress of a warmer world will weaken human
immune systems. If industrial society collapses or is greatly reduced,
healthcare and medicines might become very limited, lowering life
expectancy dramatically. [Humans]{.mark} that survive all the dangers
associated with runaway global warming might [succumb to
pandemics]{.mark} that will likely sweep the world as opportunistic
pathogens take advantage of weakened human systems and cause a large
loss of life in the remaining human populations.]{.underline}

#### Scenario two is Taiwan---

#### 5G cyber is the new battlefield, mutual cooperation between US-NATO with the Baltics key to combat China and Russia

[In light of power competition vis-à-vis cooperation with the US,
NATO,]{.underline} and the EU, [and small states standing up to larger
powers with **nefarious intentions,**]{.underline} the drawback is that
no entity is capable of defeating all cyberattacks; rather, in order to
succeed in cyberspace**[, the key is learning how to adequately
[cope.]{.mark}]{.underline}**24 [When it comes to information warfare,
and one of the reasons for which it is so dangerous, is that the
antagonist need not win -- they succeed if they are able to successfully
cloud the issue.]{.underline}25 [It is no secret that **Russia has
waged** **numerous information warfare campaigns in the Baltics** and
show **no sign of giving up.** **Recommendations and policy
developments**]{.underline} Keep on the cusp of cyber hygiene and widely
promote amongst citizens: General H.R. McMaster notes [the importance of
American efforts to conduct reconnaissance in cyberspace and preempt
attacks]{.underline}.26 S[trive to continuously be one step ahead of
hackers. Although this is a daunting, if not (nearly) impossible task,
it is one which would involve both governments and the general
public.]{.underline} One aspect which has greatly contributed to [the
success of Estonia in becoming a world leader in cyber defence is
investing in people.]{.underline}27 Promoting cyber hygiene is one
aspect at which Estonia excels. Raising further awareness about media
literacy to combat disinformation and misinformation also helps to win
the battle against information warfare. [McMaster also **advocates for
the US to learn from countries** which were on the receiving end of
Russian aggression]{.underline}.28 As one of the strengths which Estonia
possesses is its investment in people, Estonia is a success story in
cyber and IT education and training, ranging from kindergarteners to the
elderly.29 [In an increasingly multipolar world order**, the rise of
China presents a serious security challenge** to Europe and the
Transatlantic alliance and can be seen on a number of
fronts.]{.underline} [One of the most pressing, especially when it comes
to cybersecurity, is 5G. If seen through the lens of 'the West', then a
united front should consist of the US and NATO, plus PfP
countries,]{.underline} along with the EU in cyber policy. [When it
comes to 5G, this is especially important. The Baltic states have taken
strides to become leaders in 5G policy and can use this opportunity to
take a leading role in a Western front in the battlegrounds for 5G
policy]{.underline}. [Keeping focus on **both China and Russia as
threats to the security of NATO**]{.underline} and the EU: For valid
reasons -- both historical and contemporary -- the Russian Federation is
identified as the primary security threat to the 3 Baltic states. The
most contemporary events in the neighborhood do not indicate any change
in the consistency or persistence of the threat, nor its digital nature.
[Cyber and hybrid threats directed towards the Baltic states from the
Russian Federation will not cease and military, government, and civilian
entities need to continue with vigilance, adapt to the rapidly changing
nature of cybersecurity and cyberwar, as well as anticipate future
changes, staying ahead of the curve.]{.underline} However, despite the
very valid concerns over Russian cyber activity, the [Baltic states
should not neglect such concerns as they relate to China. Indeed, as
aforementioned, the Baltic states, especially Lithuania, have taken a
firm stance towards China,]{.underline} [in cyberspace and
beyond,]{.underline} and should continue to use their growing digital
prowess to expand their influence in the EU and NATO. Lithuania, under
the leadership of Foreign Minister Gabrielius 63 Landsbergis, has
increasingly stood up to China.30 Minister Landsbergis's stance towards
China led to him being named as one of Politico's 'most influential
people in Europe' -- and the only one to make the list from any of the
Baltic states.31 [Latvia has called upon China to respect the rules of
international cyberspace.32 It should be noted that this is certainly
not the first time that leaders from the Baltic states have appeared on
similar lists]{.underline}, granting small states representation on
lists where the usual larger powers within Europe enjoy substantial
representation. Such leadership should be emulated, and the digital
advances made by the Baltic states provides an ideal way to achieve
this, as many countries look to the Baltics as digital leaders.
Demonstrating leadership to allies: If ever there was a time, as well as
a concrete area for the Baltic states to showcase their strengths as
small states, demonstrating leadership in the cyber and tech fields
presents the perfect opportunity. [Estonia has been the Baltic champion
for cybersecurity and e-governance. Lithuania, and to a lesser extent
Latvia have shown signs of catching up. Much like offline matters, the
three Baltic states use opportunities to meet with US]{.underline} and
EU [leaders to highlight the dire security situation which the
Transatlantic alliance faces from a resurgent Russia]{.underline} --
they know from experience and contemporary matters. As the security of
cyberspace is one of the acute questions of global politics this
century33, cybersecurity and matters of digital warfare will be issues
which merit pressing resolve, which is constantly changing. Being on the
cutting edge will require countries to remain that way. While member of
the United Nations Security Council for the first time, Estonia made
cybersecurity a priority, along with the overall security of the
region.34 As well, when a member of the UN Security Council, Estonia
made it a point to align with the US and the UK to call Russia out over
a cyberattack directed at Georgia.35 Latvia and Lithuania have also been
active on such fronts. In 2021, Latvia signed an agreement with Poland
which establishes a framework for cooperation between Latvia's Military
Information Technology Security 64 Incident Team (MilCERT) and Poland's
National Cyber Security Center.36 Latvia is also taking the opportunity
to reach out to the United States to discuss cybersecurity in the
region.37 Lithuania has, as aforementioned, developed their own cyber
center the RCDC, which is a bilateral LithuanianUS initiative.38
Conclusion To conclude[, the domain of cyberspace will be an arena for
battle for the foreseeable future. All countries, governments,
militaries will be faced with such threats, and the likelihood of
businesses and private individuals being faced with such threats is
high.]{.underline} The Baltic states are no strangers to such threats
and have been leaders in facing up to them. Given the nature of threats
faced and the manner in which the Baltics have faced up to them, [it is
safe to say that the Baltic states will continue to rise up to the
challenges and keep up with the rapidly changing nature of cyber
threats. However, the last point is the most persisting challenge any
entity faces in cyberspace -- the need to not only consistently keep up
but remain steps ahead of adversaries. The bi- and multilateral
agreements made as well as the leadership demonstrated, and the digital
awareness can go a long way to not only meet contemporary and future
challenges but serve as examples and demonstrate
leadership.]{.underline} Cyber and hybrid threats are ominous, but on a
positive note, the Baltic states have achieved many remarkable
accomplishments in this field.

Lithuanian model for expanding Taiwan's ties with Baltic
States]{.underline}**",
https://www.caribbeannewsglobal.com/the-lithuanian-model-for-expanding-taiwans-ties-with-baltic-states/)LR

[The establishment of a representative office in Lithuania constitutes a
victory for Taiwan in its efforts to counter both international
isolation and the Chinese narrative of Taiwan's supposedly inevitable
international isolation.]{.underline} By focusing on a part of the world
that has not traditionally been an area for Taiwanese presence and
engagement, Taipei has also demonstrated the virtues of an asymmetrical
approach to combating China on the world stage. [This development also
exposes the fact that Beijing is willing to break its own rules on "One
China," in that it is now willing to punish states even when they
continue to abide by their "One-China Policy" by not establishing
official ties with Taiwan.]{.underline} Although the object of Beijing's
ire is ostensibly related to the nomenclature used for Taiwan's office
in Vilnius (which uses the word "Taiwan"), at a deeper level, the source
of its anger is the gains that Taiwan has made in Europe, an area where
China had hoped to increase its influence. Lithuania has taken some
risks in placing its bets on Taiwan, and besides the retaliation it is
currently facing, the move may also have cost it future economic
opportunities. [Consequently, it will be crucial for Taiwan to
demonstrate that Vilnius' risk-taking was not in vain. Already, a large
Taiwanese trade and investment delegation has visited the country, with
a total of 240 online and offline trade talks involving more than 150
Lithuanian firms and various Taiwanese ones.]{.underline} Taiwan must
build on the complementarity of the two economies to replicate its
successes in countries like the Czech Republic, where despite much
Chinese propaganda, [Taiwan has been a much more substantial investor
and job creator. Lithuania has a hard-working, highly educated and
productive workforce in the manufacturing sector, with strengths in
areas such as the laser industry---which has also become a target for
Chinese retaliation, with China deciding to halt cooperation between its
laser industry bodies and Lithuania.]{.underline} Trade forms the basis
of bilateral relations and must be mutually beneficial. Lithuania has
made it clear that it expects to reap the benefits of engagement with
Taiwan, a country with an economy approximately 11 times larger than its
own, as well as a highly advanced tech sector. Lithuania therefore
represents a golden opportunity for Taiwan to showcase the advantages of
engagement and to demonstrate that small and medium states not only can
afford to defy China but can actually benefit materially from doing so.
[Conversely, failure to build upon and to sustain this momentum could
dissuade prospective partners from going down that path. Thus, Taipei
must demonstrate a commitment to building prosperous and mutually
beneficial ties with its new Baltic ally,]{.underline} and the [tangible
results must materialize as expeditiously as possible]{.underline}. [The
potential for engagement between Taiwan and the Baltics goes well beyond
trade and investment, however. Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia all have
traditions of resistance to external aggression and, by virtue of their
proximity to Russia,]{.underline} [have developed their own strategies
to counter the security threat posed by their much more powerful -- and
like China, expansionist neighbor. **Taiwan and the Baltic states,**
therefore, **have much to learn from each other**, in areas **ranging
from cyber and hybrid warfare to the implementation of an asymmetrical
defense posture.** While Russia poses the more immediate threat to the
Baltic region underscored by apprehensions across the region that Moscow
could launch an invasion of Ukraine as early as next January -- it is
also clear that China has become a more active player in the region,
with all the risks of espionage, cyberattacks, co-optation, and hybrid
threats that this new presence entails. Countries like Lithuania that
have already defied Beijing are now bracing for the very real
possibility of cyberattacks against their institutions]{.underline}, and
this is an area where Taiwan's expertise in addressing such threats can
come in handy. [**Appropriate intelligence-sharing mechanisms** must
therefore be established to facilitate communication, threat mitigation,
and response; these are areas where, again, Baltic states can make real
gains from a deeper relationship with Taiwan, whose capabilities in the
cyber sector are larger by orders of magnitude.]{.underline} The
fledgling relationship with this part of Europe also creates
opportunities for Taiwan's indigenous defense industry, particularly in
the unmanned vehicle sector: for example, Taiwan donated 10 police
drones to Lithuania in October to assist the country as it deals with an
influx of refugees from Belarus. For its part, [Taiwan has much to learn
from the Baltic states in non-traditional military areas, particularly
in areas of state resilience and the concept of total
defense.]{.underline} For example, as it explores ways by which to
increase its deterrence against a Chinese attack, [the Taiwanese
military could learn important lessons from the Lithuanian Lietuvos
Šaulių Sąjunga ("Riflemen's Union"), the Estonian Defense League, and
the National Guard, initiatives that blend traditional military forces
with a militia and civilian component.]{.underline} Among other things,
Taiwan could learn from those countries' experiences in providing
training to these additional layers of defense, as well as how and where
to safely store weapons so that they can be quickly accessed by
paramilitary forces in times of national emergency. No doubt Taiwan
could learn a thing or two about forming and training a proper Reserve
Force. Taiwan and the Baltics can also identify areas for the joint
training of special forces and other units charged with waging
asymmetrical war against a much more powerful and better-equipped
opponent[. Latvia and Lithuania, in particular, have clearly signaled
their willingness to engage Taiwan more closely on such matters. For
this to happen, the Taiwanese government will have to be willing to go
beyond its traditional areas of engagement on security issues, and
civilian authorities will have to contend with a culture of historical
resistance within the ministry of national defense to the idea of giving
the population a role in national security]{.underline} (especially one
that involves arming them). But as with trade, Taipei will need to
overcome those difficulties and, as rapidly as possible, demonstrate to
its potential partners that it is ready to engage them in a way that is
mutually beneficial. As the experience with Lithuania shows, an
unprecedented window of opportunity has been created for Taiwan in the
Baltics -one that will not remain open indefinitely. While we cannot
expect results overnight, especially on security matters, [Taipei cannot
afford to drag its feet -- and must therefore be proactive in its
efforts to turn this potential into a source of real benefits for all
the countries involved. It has natural and willing partners in the
Baltics; Taipei, too, must demonstrate that it means what it
says.]{.underline} If it does well in that area, there is a high
likelihood that countries elsewhere will take notice. Failure to seize
this moment, however, could have long-term detrimental effects on
Taiwan's appeal, and thereby strengthen China's ability to deter
engagement with Taiwan. The ball, therefore, is very much in Taipei's
court. The main point: A window of opportunity has opened for Taiwan to
deepen its engagement with the Baltic states, a grouping of small
nations that also faces an existential threat from a powerful
authoritarian neighbor. In areas ranging from trade to non-traditional
defense, these states are natural allies for Taiwan, and provide a
chance for Taipei to showcase the real benefits of closer ties despite
threatened retaliation by Beijing.

cyber-attacks, and interfering in Taiwan s democratic
process.]{.underline} While Xi continues to publicly stress his
commitment to peaceful reunification" with Taiwan and has not introduced
an explicit timeline for achieving this objective, he has also said that
the Taiwan issue cannot be passed on from generation to generation."2 He
has set 2049 as the date by which China must achieve the great
rejuvenation of the Chinese nation," and achieving reunification" with
Taiwan is a core condition for that project.3 [Still, it remains
unlikely that Xi has already decided to use force against Taiwan, which
provides an opening for the United States to adjust its policies and
work with its allies to help prevent such an outcome. Although there is
debate over whether China will resort to force, China is clearly
developing capabilities needed to invade and occupy Taiwan.]{.underline}
Preparing for a conflict over Taiwan has driven China s military
modernization campaign for the past two and a half decades. [China has
invested significant resources in developing the tools to defeat Taiwan
and prevent the United States from coming to its aid, principally an
arsenal of accurate ballistic missiles, the world's largest navy,
hundreds of modern fighter aircraft and bombers, and advanced cyber and
counterspace assets]{.underline} The recommendations proposed, while
ambitious, are feasible in the current political climate in both
Washington and Tokyo, and, with sustained focus in both capitals, can be
implemented in the next five years. [While China has a number of options
it could take to put pressure on Taiwan---seizing an offshore island,
**initiating massive cyberattacks**, firing hundreds of ballistic
missiles to take out critical infrastructure, and conducting a
quarantine of the island]{.underline}---this paper focuses squarely on
how to deter and respond to an invasion of Taiwan. It does so in the
belief that Japan s appetite for assisting the United States in
countering Chinese aggression against Taiwan short of a full war is
politically challenging and likely limited[. China is not relying on its
inherent advantages, however, and has instead spent the last two and a
half decades developing capabilities designed to neutralize U.S. power
in the Taiwan Strait.]{.underline} Its military budget has grown from
\$14.3 billion in 1996 to \$252.3 billion in 2020, a nearly eighteenfold
increase (see figure 2).7 [Preparing for a conflict over Taiwan has
consistently driven Beijing s procurement decisions, and China can now
bring significant capabilities to bear.]{.underline} The PLA Navy (PLAN)
is now the largest navy in the world (as measured by the number of
ships, although the United States continues to exceed it by tonnage),
with 355 ships and submarines, and is set to grow by nearly 100 ships by
the end of the decade.8 The PLA Air Force is the largest air force in
the region and is rapidly catching up to Western air forces" and eroding
U.S. advantages, according to the U.S. Department of Defense.9 The PLA
has one thousand short-range ballistic missiles and six hundred
medium-range ballistic missiles in its arsenal.10 [China has also
established an advanced integrated air defense system on its east coast
that can cover Taiwan.]{.underline}11 [The PLA is now turning its
attention to addressing previous gaps that have persisted, such as
anti-submarine warfare, while also rapidly developing information,
cyber, and space and counterspace capabilities.]{.underline}12 Taiwan,
however, is belatedly recognizing the need to dramatically rethink and
invest in its defense. In 2017, its military leadership introduced the
Overall Defense Concept(ODC), which aims to develop asymmetric
approaches to fend off a Chinese invasion and calls for investing in a
large number of smaller, cheaper, and more mobile weapons.23 Rather than
seeking to defeat the PLA through attrition, ODC focuses on a decisive
fight near Taiwans shores and the prevention of a successful PLA
landing. Taiwan has steadily increased its defense budget in recent
years, which is now the highest it has ever been in absolute terms.24
More important is using these funds to resource an asymmetric strategy,
purchasing missiles, drones, and howitzers.25 There remain obstacles to
ODC s implementation, however, and more traditional thinking could well
make a comeback.26 All of this means that U.S. intervention on Taiwan s
behalf would be a risky and costly proposition, as China can now
challenge the United States across all domains and place U.S. aircraft,
surface vessels (including aircraft carriers), and bases throughout the
Indo-Pacific at risk. [In addition, the United States would for the
first time be fighting a nuclear-armed opponent with precision standoff
weapons, extensive cyberwarfare capabilities, and the ability to target
its satellites.27]{.underline}

[Russia's invasion of Ukraine has raised the specter of nuclear
war]{.underline}, as Russian President Vladimir Putin has placed his
nuclear forces at an elevated state of alert and has warned that any
effort by outside parties to interfere in the war would result in
"consequences you have never seen." [Such saber-rattling has
understandably made headlines and drawn notice in Washington. But if
China attempted to forcibly invade Taiwan]{.underline} and the United
States came to Taipei's aid, [the **threat of escalation could
outstrip** even the current nerve-wracking situation in
Europe]{.underline}. A recent war game, conducted by the Center for a
New American Security in conjunction with the NBC program "Meet the
Press," demonstrated just how quickly such a conflict could escalate.
The game posited a fictional crisis set in 2027, with the aim of
examining how the United States and China might act under a certain set
of conditions. The game demonstrated that [China's military
modernization and expansion of its nuclear arsenal]{.underline}---not to
mention the importance Beijing places on unification with Taiwan---[mean
that, in the real world, a fight between China and the United States
could very well go nuclear]{.underline}. [Beijing views Taiwan as a
breakaway republic. If the Chinese Communist Party decides to invade the
island, its leaders may not be able to accept failure]{.underline}
without seriously harming the regime's legitimacy. [Thus, the CCP might
be willing to take significant risks to ensure that the conflict ends on
terms that it finds acceptable]{.underline}. That would mean convincing
the United States and its allies that the costs of defending Taiwan are
so high that it is not worth contesting the invasion. While China has
several ways to achieve that goal, [from Beijing's perspective, using
nuclear weapons may be the most effective]{.underline} means to keep the
United States out of the conflict. China is several decades into
transforming its People's Liberation Army (PLA) into what the Chinese
President Xi Jinping has called a "world-class military" that could
defeat any third party that comes to Taiwan's defense. China's
warfighting strategy, known as "anti-access/area denial," rests on being
able to project conventional military power out several thousand miles
in order to prevent the American military, in particular, from
effectively countering a Chinese attack on Taiwan. Meanwhile, [a growing
nuclear arsenal provides Beijing with coercive leverage as well as
potentially new warfighting capabilities, which could increase the risks
of war and escalation]{.underline}. China has historically possessed
only a few hundred ground-based nuclear weapons. But last year, nuclear
scholars at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies and the
Federation of American Scientists identified three missile silo fields
under construction in the Xinjiang region. The Financial Times reported
that China might have carried out tests of hypersonic gliders as a part
of an orbital bombardment system that could evade missile defenses and
deliver nuclear weapons to targets in the continental United States. The
U.S. Department of Defense projects that by 2030, China will have around
1,000 deliverable warheads---more than triple the number it currently
possesses. Based on these projections, Chinese leaders may believe that
as early as five years from now the PLA will have made enough
conventional and nuclear gains that it could fight and win a war to
unify with Taiwan. [Our recent war game]{.underline}---in which members
of Congress, former government officials, and subject matter experts
assumed the roles of senior national security decision makers in China
and the United States---[illustrated that a U.S.-Chinese war could
escalate quickly]{.underline}. For one thing, it showed that [both
countries would face operational incentives to strike military forces on
the other's territory]{.underline}. In the game, such strikes were
intended to be calibrated to avoid escalation; both sides tried to walk
a fine line by attacking only military targets. But [such attacks
crossed red lines for both countries, and produced a **tit-for-tat cycle
of attacks that broadened the scope and intensity of the
conflict**]{.underline}. For instance, in the simulation, China launched
a preemptive attack against key U.S. bases in the Indo-Pacific region.
The attacks targeted Guam, in particular, because it is a forward
operating base critical to U.S. military operations in Asia, and because
since it is a territory, and not a U.S. state, the Chinese team viewed
striking it as less escalatory than attacking other possible targets. In
response, the United States targeted Chinese military ships in ports and
surrounding facilities, but refrained from other attacks on the Chinese
mainland. Nevertheless, both sides perceived these strikes as attacks on
their home territory, crossing an important threshold. Instead of
mirror-imaging their own concerns about attacks on their territory, each
side justified the initial blows as military necessities that were
limited in nature and would be seen by the other as such. Responses to
the initial strikes only escalated things further as the U.S. team
responded to China's moves by hitting targets in mainland China, and the
Chinese team responded to Washington's strikes by attacking sites in
Hawaii. A NEW ERA One particularly alarming finding from the war game is
that China found it necessary to threaten to go nuclear from the start
in order to ward off outside support for Taiwan. This threat was
repeated throughout the game, particularly after mainland China had been
attacked. At times, efforts to erode Washington's will so that it would
back down from the fight received greater attention by the China team
than the invasion of Taiwan itself. But China had difficulty convincing
the United States that its nuclear threats were credible. In real life,
China's significant and recent changes to its nuclear posture and
readiness may impact other nations' views, as its nuclear threats may
not be viewed as credible given its stated doctrine of no first use, its
smaller but burgeoning nuclear arsenal, and lack of experience making
nuclear threats. This may push China to preemptively detonate a nuclear
weapon to reinforce the credibility of its warning. [China might also
resort to a demonstration of its nuclear might because of constraints on
its long-range conventional strike capabilities]{.underline}. Five years
from now, the PLA still will have a very limited ability to launch
conventional attacks beyond locations in the "second island chain" in
the Pacific; namely, Guam and Palau. Unable to strike the U.S. homeland
with conventional weapons, China would struggle to impose costs on the
American people. Up until a certain point in the game, the U.S. team
felt its larger nuclear arsenal was sufficient to deter escalation and
did not fully appreciate the seriousness of China's threats. As a
result, China felt it needed to escalate significantly to send a message
that the U.S. homeland could be at risk if Washington did not back down.
Despite China's stated "no-first use" nuclear policy, the war game
resulted in Beijing detonating a nuclear weapon off the coast of Hawaii
as a demonstration. The attack caused relatively little destruction, as
the electromagnetic pulse only damaged the electronics of ships in the
immediate vicinity but did not directly impact the U.S. state. The war
game ended before the U.S. team could respond, but it is likely that the
first use of a nuclear weapon since World War II would have provoked a
response. The most likely paths to nuclear escalation in a fight between
the United States and China are different from those that were most
likely during the Cold War. The Soviet Union and the United States
feared a massive, bolt-from-the-blue nuclear attack, which would
precipitate a full-scale strategic exchange. In a confrontation over
Taiwan, however, Beijing could employ nuclear weapons in a more limited
way to signal resolve or to improve its chances of winning on the
battlefield. It is unclear how a war would proceed after that kind of
limited nuclear use and whether the United States could de-escalate the
situation while still achieving its objectives. AN OUNCE OF PREVENTION
[The clear lesson from the war game is that the United States needs to
**strengthen**]{.underline} its [**conventional capabilities** in the
Indo-Pacific to ensure that China **never views an invasion of Taiwan as
a prudent tactical move**]{.underline}. To do so, the United States will
need to commit to maintaining its conventional military superiority by
expanding its stockpiles of long-range munitions and investing in
undersea capabilities. Washington must also be able to conduct offensive
operations inside the first and second island chains even while under
attack. This will require access to new bases to distribute U.S. forces,
enhance their survivability, and ensure that they can effectively defend
Taiwan in the face of China's attacks. Moreover, [the United States
needs to]{.underline} develop an integrated network of partners willing
to **[contribute to Taiwan's defense]{.underline}**. Allies are an
asymmetric advantage: the United States has them, and China does not.
[The United States should **deepen strategic and operational planning**
with key partners to **send a strong signal of resolve** to
China]{.underline}. As part of these planning efforts, the United States
and its allies will need to develop war-winning military strategies that
do not cross Chinese red-lines. The game highlighted just how difficult
this task may be; what it did not highlight is the complexity of
developing military strategies that integrate the strategic objectives
and military capacities of multiple nations. Moving forward, military
planners in the United States and in Washington's allies and partners
must grapple with the fact that, in a conflict over Taiwan, China would
consider all conventional and nuclear options to be on the table. And
[the United States is **running out of time** to strengthen deterrence
and keep China from believing an invasion of Taiwan could be successful.
**The biggest risk** is that Washington and its friends choose not to
seize the moment and act: **a year or two from now**, it might already
be too late]{.underline}.

## Potential Plan

#### The United States federal government should substantially increase its cyber security cooperation with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in cyber security in Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia through shared cooperation of cyber defense

## Solvency

#### The plan models NATO cybersecurity after the Baltics -- empirically dissuades Russian attacks and secures US infrastructure.

[The world is moving towards a digitised global society full of cyber
opportunities.]{.underline} However, as a fully cyber-connected society,
this future society will also have to cope with new patterns of
conflict, such as cyber-attacks and hybrid warfare.

[The Baltic countries]{.underline} - Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania -
which for years were under the control of the Union of Soviet Socialist
Republics (USSR) and then forced to fight on the front line of digital
warfare, [have been forced to take the lead in this process of
cyber-innovation]{.underline}. Moscow\'s attacks on the three pioneers
of independence from the USSR have been a constant for years. And they
have grown exponentially since the early 2000s.

The Estonian example

The Republic of Estonia was one of the Kremlin\'s first targets in 2007.
Tallinn\'s decision to move the monument to the fallen Soviet soldiers
of World War II from the centre of the capital to the \'Bronze Soldier\'
cemetery provoked a wave of cyber-attacks from Russia that lasted more
than 20 days. Public and private organisations, ministries, banks, the
media and even the parliament itself were affected by hundreds of hacker
offensives.

\"[The government website]{.underline} normally [receives]{.underline}
between [1,000 and 1,500 hits a **day**]{.underline}; at the height of
the attacks, [in the first week of May, it received between 1,000 and
1,500 per **second**]{.underline},\" explained defence spokesman Mikko
Maddis at the time. \"**[It blew up the system]{.underline}**."

Fearing that the attack was just the prelude to a larger-scale cyber
offensive, Estonia armoured itself. [The small country shifted as many
government services and systems as possible to new, private and secure
networks, improving cyber security and protecting itself against the
effects of digital warfare. This path also led Tallinn to transfer
citizen services and the most basic government functions to
**blockchain** technology.]{.underline}

Today, [Estonia has become a country capable of dealing with almost any
cyber threat; defined by The New Yorker as a \"digital republic\", its
citizens have the opportunity to access virtually all available
government services online]{.underline}, and its political and economic
leaders to run it effectively from anywhere in the world.

Indeed, in 2014 Tallinn spearheaded the world\'s first e-residency
programme, aiming to exceed 10 million residents by 2025. And while it
has so far failed to add more than 85,000 residents, [it has enabled
more than 19,000 entrepreneurs to consolidate new digital companies that
do not need to be physically present.]{.underline}

#### Cooperation with Estonia is key -- promotes cybersecurity for all of NATO

Even the pandemic has the potential for fomenting political unrest. 

In recent days, thousands of Serbs have taken to the streets to protest
Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic's announced strict curfew in response
to a surge in Covid-19 cases. Many have pointed a finger
at pro-Russia ultra-right groups and foreign intelligence services for
fueling the violent riots.

Moscow denies any "Russian trace" in the unrest. Whether Russia is
behind the violent protests in Belgrade remains to be seen. One thing is
for certain. The Kremlin's efforts to sow mayhem in the Balkans would
not be new; this would merely be the latest attempt by a resurgent
Russia to threaten Euro-Atlantic security and challenge the United
States' ability to defend its interests in Europe. 

[Russia is promoting]{.underline} its [interests in the]{.underline}
Western [Balkans through the **widespread use** of
**disinfo**rmation]{.underline} and cyberwarfare. [The
U.S.]{.underline}, however, [isn't helpless. It has an **opportunity**
to]{.underline} obtain insights into these efforts and **[counter
Russia\'s influence]{.underline}** campaigns. [**It is time** to
confront]{.underline} Russia\'s strongman Vladimir [Putin\'s **cyber
games**]{.underline} before American interests are permanently damaged
in the Balkans. 

The U.S. and the E.U. have long been ambivalent about defining their
interests in the Western Balkans. [Russia has **capitalized**
on]{.underline} these [**years of neglect** and leveraged a **power
vacuum**]{.underline} in the former Yugoslavia [to gain]{.underline}
economic and political [influence. The region is now at the forefront of
Russia\'s]{.underline} use of low-cost [strategies to]{.underline}
expand its global influence and **[undermine western
interests]{.underline}**. 

[Russian disinformation]{.underline}, aided by repeated cyberattacks on
government institutions, [was instrumental in]{.underline} the
[2016]{.underline} Moscow-sponsored coup attempt [in
Montenegro]{.underline}. In North Macedonia, Russia spread
disinformation prior to the name-change referendum that finally enabled
North Macedonia to join NATO. It also established hundreds of North
Macedonia-based "troll factories,\" from which Russia pedaled fake news
against the 2016 U.S. elections. Facebook recently banned troll farms
from North Macedonia that pushed COVID-19 disinformation. 

Moscow has also been investing in critical sectors in Croatia. With its
strategy of fomenting political divisions, the Kremlin has been
exploiting internal conflicts in Albania. In Bosnia and Herzegovina,
disinformation campaigns have sown ethnic and religious discord,
while promoting the secession of ethnic Serb regions from Bosnia. In
response, the U.S. should encourage the transatlantic integration for
Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Western Balkans' most fragile country. 

Russia has used state-sponsored media to promote nationalist and
anti-Western narratives in Serbia, including the opening of
a Sputnik office in Belgrade. Also,  Russian-run "Humanitarian
Center" in Serbia is very close to the main NATO based in Kosovo (Camp
Bondsteel). Some European and American officials fear that it serves as
a base for the Kremlin intelligence-gathering activities to eavesdrop on
U.S. interests in the Balkans. 

[[Russia's]{.underline}]{.mark} preeminent [[goals]{.mark} in the
Balkans [have been to **refine**]{.mark} their
**[disinfo]{.mark}**rmation **[tactics]{.mark}** and **erode Western
influence** in the region]{.underline}, including in Croatia,
Montenegro, North Macedonia and Albania, which are all NATO members.
[The West needs to **aggressively respond** to this Russian posture,
including using a **cyber-focused campaign** to **counter Russia\'s
provocations**. ]{.underline}

For crafting such a strategy, [[the **West should look to
Estonia**]{.underline}]{.mark}. After the 2007 Russian cyberattack on
Estonian government institutions, [[Estonia became a global leader in
cybersecurity]{.mark} and [home to the NATO **C**]{.mark}ooperative
**[C]{.mark}**yber **[D]{.mark}**efense **[C]{.mark}**entre of
**[E]{.mark}**xcellence, which is a **cyber-defense [hub]{.mark}** [that
**supports member nations** with]{.mark} **cyber-defense
[expertise]{.mark}**]{.underline}. A similar approach by the West would
benefit the Western Balkans, where information and communication
technology sector is the most promising and the fastest growing economic
sector in the region. In Serbia alone, the I.T. sector generates more
than 10% of GDP with a similar trend in other countries in the region,
which have some of the highest numbers of outsourced I.T. workers per
capita in Europe. 

[An]{.underline} [**American-led strategy** should focus on creating
a]{.underline} regional **[cyber-security infrastructure]{.underline}**
in the Western Balkans, **[modeled on Estonia\'s example]{.underline}**.
Given that countries in the Western Balkans share the same
cyber-security threats from Russia and, more recently, from China,
[a]{.underline} regional [**hub for cybersecurity** would allow states
to **cooperate among each other** in **cyber deterrence**,
**attribution** of attacks and collective
**countermeasures**]{.underline}. 

Several countries [in the [Western Balkans]{.mark}]{.underline} have
joined NATO, but [alliances are]{.underline} notoriously
**[unreliable]{.underline}**, especially among the smaller states.
[Countries in the Western Balkans [need **strong
NATO**]{.mark}]{.underline} and E.U. [t[ies to **withstand Russian
influence**]{.mark}. [Cyber-security]{.mark} [is]{.mark} one of the
areas [where they can **strengthen** their **positions**]{.mark} in
**allegiance with the western democracies**.]{.underline} 

[The **timing is excellent** for the **U.S.** to establish
a]{.underline} regional **[cyber-security hub]{.underline}** in the
Western Balkans. [**Immediate steps** need to be taken to **halt malign
Russian influence**.]{.underline} With elections approaching this year
in the U.S., North Macedonia, Croatia and Montenegro, [countries should
continue **cooperating** to counter **malicious Russian cyber
activities**]{.underline}. 

[The U.S. can]{.underline} learn more about Russian cyber tactics at the
same time. One way to send a strong message would be to [**deploy a
cyber-team** to **strengthen NATO's countries' cyber-capabilities** in
an effort to **thwart future Russian network intrusions**]{.underline}
such as the one that was undertaken by Russian intelligence operators in
Bulgaria in 2017. 

Serbia, a key ally to Moscow in the region, remains the biggest obstacle
to countering Russian influence. Serbia just had parliamentary elections
boycotted by the opposition that resulted in Vucic\'s Serbian
Progressive party winning a landslide victory and further strengthening
his power. The close Russia-Serbian relationship can make it difficult
to detect Russia\'s subversive activities. 

Of all the Western Balkans countries, Serbia had the highest military
expenditure in 2019, and President Vucic thanked Russia for making
Serbia's military 10 times stronger since NATO intervention in 1999.
After Russia employed an S-400 missile system in Serbia for a military
drill, the Pantsir S1 air-defense systems were delivered this past
February, despite a looming U.S. sanctions threat.  

Should Serbia continue obtaining Russian weapons, Washington should
impose sanctions. Serbia must understand that its strategy of neutrality
is unacceptable to the U.S., as are its claims to balance their
interests among Russia, China and the West. [[The U.S. should
remain]{.mark} **solidly [committed]{.mark}**]{.underline}, leading
efforts to solve the Kosovo dispute and wrest control of that narrative
from Russia. 

While variances in the national interests may complicate cooperation
among the Western Balkan [countries]{.underline}, they [share **similar
vital objectives** that make cooperation **possible** and]{.underline}
even [**attractive** under **U.S. leadership**]{.underline}. Among these
are the historical fear of Russian domination and a desire for E.U. and
NATO membership. [A [**U.S.-led strategy** with]{.mark} [NATO]{.mark}
country participation [to enhance]{.mark} their
**[cyber-capabilities]{.mark}** [will]{.mark} **[improve]{.mark}** their
**[security]{.mark}** in **[countering]{.mark} nefarious [Russian
influence]{.mark}** [while **enhancing coop**]{.mark}**eration**
[between Balkan]{.mark}]{.underline} [[nations]{.mark}. ]{.underline}

[Moscow is **determined** to **expand its influence**]{.underline} in
the Western Balkans, [using **cyber-warfare** at the **expense** of U.S.
and western interests. To prevent it, the **U.S. should design a new
strategy**]{.underline} for the Western Balkans [that demonstrates that
the U.S. is **committed** to countering Russia\'s disruptive
activities]{.underline} in the Western Balkans and beyond. The time for
that response is now.

[Estonia does not have a standalone policy of cyber deterrence, but
strategic documents relating to national security, foreign policy and
cybersecurity describe diverse components of cyber
deterrence.]{.underline} Cybersecurity is deemed a part of foreign,
security and defence policy, as well as domestic/internal security. It
is also included in strategic documents and policies concerning digital
modernization, technology, education and research, and so forth. The
review and analysis of Estonia's strategic documents associated with
cybersecurity (presented in Annex I) shows that two concepts --
cross-domain deterrence and cyber deterrence -- play an important role
in the government's cybersecurity discourse. [Three layers of deterrence
-- entanglement and norms, denial and punishment -- are equally
upheld.]{.underline} Generally speaking, the analysis demonstrates that
in the Estonian national security discourse, deterrence by denial and
punishment tend to be conceptualized in the context of national security
and defence policy; entanglement and norms in the context of foreign
policy and cyber diplomacy; and denial (domestic defence/resilience) in
the context of digital and technology policies. In the latest strategy
(2019--2022), cyber deterrence is referenced almost as frequently as in
the 2014--2017 document, apart from the fact that cross-domain
deterrence and military deterrence are not mentioned. [Rather, concerns
about challenges relating to digital modernization and technology
policies come to the fore in this strategy. The last column of Table 2
provides examples of how a deterrence tool has been
implemented.]{.underline} ![Table Description automatically

capacity, Estonia established a position in 2018 for an

among the Baltic and Nordic countries when it comes to cyber
diplomacy.]{.underline} It has been a member of the UN Group of
Governmental Experts for many years, and is also a leader in cyber
diplomacy education for foreign diplomats.35 As a member of the UN
Security Council in 2020-- 2021, in June 2021 [Estonia organized for the
first time in the Council's history an open meeting on cybersecurity,
where it raised the issue of state behaviour in cyberspace in the
context of international peace and security]{.underline}.36 Since 2008,
[Estonia has hosted the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of
Excellence (CCDCOE), which sponsors the publication of world-renowned
scholarly works on international law applicable]{.underline} to
cyberspace -- the Tallinn Manuals 1.0 (2013), 2.0 (2017), and the
forthcoming volume 3.0.37 [Deterrence by denial, conceptualized in
Estonia primarily as domestic defence/resilience measures, is
foundational for the country's cybersecurity posture]{.underline}.38
Deterrence in this area includes a full spectrum of activities
prescribed in the national cybersecurity strategies, in cybersecurity
legislation and other relevant ministerial regulations. [Some of the
resilience-related objectives have remained constant since 2008, such as
applying measures to harden networks (for example, standards, risk
analysis and management tools, incident response, raising awareness,
building cybersecurity capacity and competence, to name a
few).]{.underline}39 In June 2021, Estonia published its first national
information security standard entitled E-ITS, which is a guideline for
public and private network owners and operators to ensure minimum
security standards.40 The Estonian Information System Authority
regularly alerts stakeholders and the general public to cyber threats,
vulnerabilities and exploits, and helps them to protect their networks.
[These activities contribute to deterrence by denial by increasing the
ability to protect networks and recover from cyber incidents. Public
attribution can be regarded as a tool for deterrence.]{.underline}46
Indeed, among Estonian experts, public attribution is regarded as a
primary tool of cyber deterrence.47 As noted by scholars, one aim of
public attribution is the act of norm-setting -- that is, establishing
"the rules of the road" and subsequently enforcing appropriate behaviour
in cyberspace (response measures).48 In a similar manner, the Estonian
government holds that "public statements on attribution can be made,
with the aim of increasing accountability in cyberspace and emphasising
the importance of adhering to international law obligations and norms of
responsible state behaviour".49 [The Estonian Ministry of Foreign
Affairs subscribes to the opinion that "public attribution \[...\]
allows states to send clear messages and shape expectations that
malicious cyberspace operations will not be tolerated" and "it is
necessary to send a message that harmful cyberspace operations are not
part of acceptable state behaviour".]{.underline}50 In other words,
Estonia directly links public attribution to setting cyber norms, thus
connecting deterrence by entanglement and norms to legal consequences,
namely deterrence by punishment. According to this view, Estonia
supports public attribution and collective measures "where possible" and
"public attribution and messaging are tools for deterring and responding
\[...\] but also for raising wider awareness".51 To support collective
public attribution and to hold violators responsible, [**Estonia
actively contributes to** EU and **NATO cyber deterrence discussions,
and belongs to the US-led international cyber deterrence
initiative**]{.underline}.52 [**Based on the Estonian case study**, a
policy recommendation for EU and **NATO countries is to apply a
three-layered deterrence model**]{.underline}.73 First, EU and [NATO
countries should participate in entanglement and norms measures such as
cyber diplomacy and capacity-building globally. Second, they should
invest more in denial measures and, third, jointly develop policies for
punitive response options, including developing public attribution
procedures to enable quick attribution, and systematically implementing
sanctions regimes.]{.underline} It would be feasible to establish
memoranda of understanding, and operational- and technical-level
frameworks to radically improve information- and intelligence-sharing.
Participation in cyber defence and crisis management exercises should be
open to like-minded NATO partner countries. Joint bilateral cyberspace
operations likewise contribute to mutual trust-building and
information-sharing, and increase parties' operational and technical
competence.74 Operational- and technical-level joint activities should
be regularly practised among allies and with like-minded partners as
they contribute to deterrence by denial. Given that NATO's cyber With
regard to deterrence by denial, Estonia, together with other EU and NATO
countries, should develop a zero trust security strategy and
architecture.75 Zero trust is a cybersecurity paradigm that treats
networks as untrusted, and that moves defences from static,
network-based perimeters to focus on users, assets, and resources. It
assumes that there is no implicit trust granted to user accounts or
assets in any network segment (including a corporate local area
network), and applies authentication and authorization before a session
is established.76 While deterrence might work at the high end, novel
security principles should be implemented by governments because
deterrence is not sufficient to deter cyberattacks. Estonia's public
attribution guidelines serve as a blueprint for other countries to
attribute cyberattacks and impose meaningful costs. A sharper focus on
responses to high- and low-end cyberattacks should be developed in the
future along with concrete deterrence actions and tools for individual
75 For example, the US government has released a strategy, architecture
and maturity model that the US federal government agencies will
implement: 'Moving the U.S. Government Towards Zero Trust Cybersecurity
Principles', The White House, https://zerotrust.cyber.gov/. 76 Scott
Rose, Oliver Borchert, Stu Mitchell and Sean Connelly, 'Zero Trust
Architecture SP 800-207', August 2020, NIST,

types. For example, deterrence tools can differ for diverse targets:
internet voting and e-health systems would be targeted by different
cyber threat actors that have political or criminal motives, and the
same tool is not effective across all actors. [Estonia's forms of cyber
deterrence are not effective individually, nor every time, but **when
implemented together in a whole-of-society approach, and systematically
over a longer period of time,** it is likely that **many malicious
cyberattacks can be deterred.**]{.underline} As Joseph Nye pointed out,
deterrence tools "can complement one other in affecting actors'
perceptions of the costs and benefits of particular actions".[77
Certainly, one cannot deter all cyberattacks -- especially those
conducted as part of malicious influencing campaigns below the threshold
of the use of force -- however, it is possible to reduce the number and
effect of strategic cyberspace operations.]{.underline} It is likely
that punitive responses may deter hostile actors from conducting similar
attacks in the future. It will remain to be seen whether the EU and
[**NATO can deter cyberattacks** both above and below the threshold of
an armed attack better in the future **when they apply systematically
stronger punitive responses.**]{.underline}

#### Mutual Cooperation is key

In conclusion[, taking into account the current geopolitical situation
and the number of commitments in the international arena, the Baltic
States are likely to remain strong US allies and important US security
partners in Europe.]{.underline} **[Analysts believe that close
cooperation between the United States and the Baltic States will
continue for the foreseeable future]{.underline}** in areas such as
efforts to deter potential Russian aggression, the future of NATO,
energy security, and socioeconomic issues[. As long as there are
objective fears of peace demolition, NATO is interested in deepening
cooperation with like-minded countries. **There is still work to be done
within the Baltic region to strengthen resistance to Russian propaganda
and maintain sovereignty and determination towards pro-European
standards in the socio-economic field**. This work will follow, for
instance, the example of banning Russian propaganda in the media. To
achieve this, the Baltic States will likely continue to rely on the
United States for leadership on foreign policy and security issues. This
can be seen from current partnership programs devoted to enhancing
defence power and providing training and an educational
practicum.]{.underline} This reliance is not only from the side of the
Baltic region; it is seen as a reciprocal one[. For instance, there are
climate change issues where Lithuania can share its experience and the
best approaches to green ecology with the United States, and the US may
be more eager to cooperate with Lithuania.]{.underline} Moreover, in
terms of geopolitics, the United States should try to defeat China's
attempts to collaborate with US allies on the same issues. On
successfully implementing and finalising those partnership activities,
further steps will be taken to proceed with cooperation. [In short, the
United States' commitment to Baltic security is part of the US
commitment to European security, and the former would not and cannot
exist without the latter]{.underline}. [As new challenges are emerging,
more efforts should be made to guarantee these commitments, thus
strengthening transatlantic ties concerns building this partnership,
reinforcing power, and preventing threats. This attitude undoubtedly
appears to be beneficial for both sides.]{.underline}

**threat of cyberattacks on European soil is** **two-fold:

[Within this context, deterrence could falter in some scenarios. There
is a plausible -- if still small -- chance that Russia could notice US
risk-aversion over enabling Ukraine to fight back too hard, and flagging
Western support for Ukraine generally, and conclude that attacking a
small NATO country would not result in a war with the US. Some may
incredulously respond that such an outcome is impossible, because of
course the US has the resolve to defend every inch of NATO. Even if the
US has such resolve, for deterrence to hold, Moscow must believe
that.]{.underline} Deterrence can fail if an aggressor decides that a
defending country cannot or will not make good on its deterrent threats.
[Therefore, strong signals underscoring the US and broader NATO
commitment to defend the Baltic states are in order, especially
considering Germany's denunciation of Lithuania's sovereign decision to
enforce EU sanctions on Russia.]{.underline}

[NATO and the European Union might not get directly involved in a
military confrontation with Russia, should Vladimir Putin decide to
expand the conflict beyond Ukraine\'s borders, a former US Ambassador to
Ukraine has warned. As]{.underline} Europe is suffering from the
economic sanctions imposed on Russia with inflation propelling up prices
across the continent, former Ambassador Herbst says it is becoming more
likely Europe will cave in. The latest Russian threat is an energy
blackmail through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline -- currently closed because
of maintenance -- which may not reopen on the July 21 deadline, dropping
Russian gas imports to close to zero -- a scenario that could plunge the
EU into an energy crisis.

[When asked about the possibility of Putin expanding the war beyond
Ukraine's border, Ambassador Herbst told Express.co.uk: \"He \[Putin\]
has said he believes he should have a substantial influence in all the
post-Soviet countries.]{.underline}

[\"He has demanded that he can impose restrictions on NATO deployments
among the former member of the Warsaw Pact. He's not hiding
this.\"]{.underline}

[On the danger of Russia invading NATO countries, Ambassador Herbst
said: \"You've just described the scenario as plausible where the EU is
going to cave to Russia as it is committing mass atrocities in
Ukraine.]{.underline}

\"So, if the EU is willing to cave on Ukraine, why wouldn't he bet on
the Baltic States -- these hard-to-defend little states that have joined
the EU only relatively recently and joined NATO relatively recently and
that Russia controlled for centuries?\"

When pressed on the fact Russia would lose a war against NATO,
Ambassador Herbst said: \"Why would he assume NATO is going to fight?
You're describing a Europe that is craven -- the same European countries
that make up the EU make up NATO.\"

[Further elaborating, he said: \"I'm saying that Putin might reckon that
just as NATO has limited its support to Ukraine, just as the EU caved on
sanctions, there will not be enough guts in Europe to defend the Baltic
States.]{.underline}

[\"That is a very plausible scenario.]{.underline}

## Hybrid War Disinformation

#### Specifically, Russia will use disinformation in order to destabilize the region

**Horchakova 2022**, Veronika Horchakova Mykolas Romeris University,
European and International Business Law program, Master's degree
student("STRENGTHENING THE TRANSATLANTIC PARTNERSHIP: CHALLENGES AND
OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE BALTIC STATES"
https://repository.mruni.eu/bitstream/handle/007/18311/Teisines_minties_svente-97-107.pdf?sequence=1)

[The other non-military threat for the Baltic region is Moscow's use of
the Russophone minority as political instruments against the West. For
example, signs of warfare were identified when Russian-speaking
inhabitants in Vilnius received brochures with disinformation on the
economic situation in Lithuania and a call to participate in the
resettlement of ethnic Russians from Lithuania to Russia.13 This kind of
propaganda was also used in Ukraine to disrupt loyalty to the State. The
Baltic countries need to create a "defensive shield" to fight against
Russia's disinformation and propaganda. Moscow's primary goal is to form
a positive opinion of Russia among local inhabitants by creating
dissatisfaction with the relevant governments, shaping and
misrepresenting historical facts, and exploiting the vulnerabilities of
the Baltic's political systems, economy, and society. Here the
Lithuanian case can serve as a guide for the other two Baltic States and
NATO members, too.]{.underline} The roots of the anti-Russian propaganda
and disinformation campaign originated in 2016, when Lithuania
introduced temporary bans on Russian media outlets that breached
pre-existing media laws.14 Shortly after that, the Lithuanian parliament
adopted an ordinance restricting Russian media production content on
Lithuanian TV. In 2018, the Lithuanian parliament adopted new amendments
to the Public Information Law. TV channels in Lithuania must translate
TV programs into Lithuanian "if these programs are produced in Russian
or other non-EU languages and broadcast for longer than one hour and a
half."15 [Such restrictions are effective at diminishing the Russian
influence, but are not a panacea. As for cyber security, the Baltic
States have undertaken successful work in combating cyber-attacks.
According to the International Telecommunication Union's Global
Cybersecurity Index 2020, among 194 countries, Estonia is ranked third
after the US and the UK. Followed by the Russian Federation, Lithuania
is the sixth-best cyber protected country. Latvia completes the list of
the top 15.16 This ranking is based on five pillars: legal, technical,
organizational, capacity building, and cooperation measurements related
to cybersecurity]{.underline}. Since 2019, these countries have each had
Cyber Security Strategies, but we have to consider that these rankings
are not always reliable, and sometimes they do not represent reality in
all its shapes. Despite establishing the NATO cooperative Cyber Defence
Centre of Excellence in 2008 (hosted by Estonia), several commentators
have criticized the real cyber warfare capabilities of NATO. In a 2019
interview, the former supreme allied commander of NATO, Adm. James
Stavridis, USN (Ret.), warned that "in cyber, and cybersecurity, we have
the greatest mismatch between the level of threat and level of
preparation."17 New asymmetric or technological threats require
extensive cooperation not only within but also outside of the Alliance.
The security and defence sectors in the Baltic States need to build
partnerships with the private and academic sectors, all of which will
need to cooperate with each other to maintain situational and
technological awareness.18 [It is clear that, in reality, the ongoing
conflict between western countries and Russia does not take place inside
tanks or submarines but behind a computer. Russia has massively
increased its cyber warfare capabilities and is particularly strong in
social manipulation and other cyber-attacks. In this context, there are
signs of significant commitment over time to enable the Baltic countries
to develop their national defence further. For example, the Baltic
States have already signed a five-year roadmap of defence cooperation
with the Pentagon,19 meaning that, by 2024, capability development and
defence-related aid, training exercises, and cyber defence will be
exercised with the US. Officials emphasized the benefits of this program
and said that they look forward to its further development. Activated
transatlantic relationships are the perfect opportunity for Lithuania,
Latvia, and Estonia to generate new partnership programs, agreements,
and projects against Russian soft power.]{.underline}

#### Aims to destabilize Baltics separate from NATO makes deterring Russia impossible -- now is key after Ukraine

Threats: The Baltic Perspective"
https://www.csce.gov/sites/helsinkicommission.house.gov/files/RKols_Hybrid%20threats%20Baltic%20Perspective-2022.pdf

[Since regaining our independence from the Soviet Union in 1990, Latvia,
Lithuania, and Estonia have been under constant Russian
pressure.]{.underline} This pressure has manifested itself is through
the conventional military threat, punctuated by ongoing airspace
violations by Russian military aircraft and navy, unannounced,
large-scale military exercises of inherently offensive nature along
their borders, and the general disposition of Russia\'s military forces
in regions closest to the Baltic borders, doing so under the pretence of
counteracting the \"hostile West\" and promoting militarism. [Influence,
psychological, and information operations have been part of Russian
doctrine since the early days of the Soviet Union, but historically they
have been relegated to supporting roles. Nevertheless, as General
Gerasimov has observed and thus included in the Russian military
doctrine, non-kinetic are exceedingly practical, and]{.underline}
[**these instruments will become dominant in future warfare. This is
reflected in most current Russian foreign, security and defence policies
and doctrinal documents.** For years, the strategic goal of Russian
information operations in the Baltic states has been to create distance
between the Baltics and the West.]{.underline} [The Russian concept is
rooted in the idea that democratic societies are vulnerable to political
manipulation, and exploiting this perceived weakness is far less costly
than pursuing annexation or occupation]{.underline}. Consequently,
Russian information operations in the Baltics focus on nine objectives:
[(1) Encourage and support armed actions by separatist groups to promote
chaos and territorial disintegration; (2) Increase polarisation between
elites and society to foment a crisis of values followed by process of
orientation toward Russian values; (3) Demoralise the military and
otherwise attrit resolve; (4) Undermine socioeconomic stability; (5)
Engender socio-political crisis; (6) Intensify simultaneous forms and
models of psychological warfare to demoralise the Baltic states\' armed
forces and population and break their resolve; (7) Incite mass panic and
degrade confidence in crucial government institutions; (8) Defame
political leaders not aligned with Russian interests; (9) and Undermine
international alliances and partnerships]{.underline}.12 [Russia seeks
to achieve its strategic ends in the Baltics through influence
operations rather than conventional means]{.underline}. Recognising
resistance to deeper ties with Russia in the Baltics, **[Russia has
diversified its messaging beyond pro-Russia content. Instead, the
Russian strategy is to attempt to convince members of the population
that their countries\' current alignment with the West, embrace of
democracy, and membership in NATO and the EU are in some way
detrimental, degrading or dangerous.]{.underline}** [Russia heavily
leverages Russian and local-language traditional media, social media,
and the internet toward this end. There is no universally agreed
definition of hybrid threats, considering that a wide range of
activities falls under this term. Moreover, hybrid threats evolve
constantly, and new means in hybrid warfare emerge.]{.underline}
However, the European Centre of Excellence for Countering Hybrid Threats
defines hybrid threats as \"an action conducted by state or non-state
actors, whose goal is to undermine or harm a target by influencing its
decision-making at the local, regional, state or institutional level.
[Such actions are coordinated and synchronised and deliberately target
democratic states and institutions\' vulnerabilities\". 3 The use of
hybrid tactics often is based on trying to undermine fundamental
democratic values and liberties, and it is done under what some call a
\"chaos strategy\". Russia sows chaos to achieve its agenda beyond its
borders by deploying an array of hybrid warfare tools - hybrid warfare
is a tactical application of the chaos strategy. Total spectrum warfare
deploys a blend of conventional and nonconventional means to affect on
the ground changes in target populations or territories while seeking to
avoid direct military confrontation.]{.underline} Hybrid warfare is
employed in a tailored way to sow chaos in target countries. Such
efforts generally include irregular warfare, active measures, and
special operations. Like the world, hybrid war is not static, and new
tools are developed and employed constantly. For the Baltics, having
lived in this environment for the majority of their lives, both under
Soviet occupation and after regaining their countries\' independence,
this multi-vector warfare - hybrid warfare tactics and the chaos they
attempt to create, have become intuitively recognisable and often seep
into the background like white noise.4 From the perspective of the
Baltic states, the development of hybrid threat-related policies at the
EU or NATO level has been a natural consequence of the changing security
landscape in Europe, especially the gradually deteriorating relations
between the West and Russia. [In the immediate aftermath of Russia\'s
first attack on Ukraine\'s sovereignty and territorial integrity,
different hybrid attack scenarios against one of the three Baltic states
were envisaged, e.g., Russia\'s attempt to overtake Narva, a city in the
extreme eastern point of Estonia, where more than 80% of the population
are ethnic Russians; or the so-called \"little green men\", armed
soldiers without insignia that were seen in Crimea in March 2014,
entering Latgale, the region in Latvia\'s east5 ; or Russia creating an
incident linked to Kaliningrad -- the Russian enclave on the Baltic sea
wedged between Lithuania and Poland]{.underline}. [In the event of any
war between Russia and NATO countries, it is through this gap that NATO
would have to rush reinforcements and supplies from Poland to the Baltic
countries, and it is this gap that Russia would have to close to prevent
that]{.underline}. [Military strategists have long suggested that
Russian forces from Belarus could attempt to punch across the narrow
Lithuanian territory known as the Suwalki Gap to the Moscow-controlled
enclave of Kaliningrad, effectively cutting off the three Baltic
states.]{.underline} 6 **[These scenarios included Russia sending troops
to \"restore order\" in case of an uprising in Kaliningrad or sabotaging
the train lines across Lithuania that serve as a vital transit corridor
from Russia.]{.underline}** [Because Baltic rail infrastructure is still
primarily dominated by Soviet-era rails of a specific gauge width, one
incompatible with the EU standard rail gauge width, the risks are
substantial enough to cause concern. It has been considered that Russia
could use the same pretext as in Ukraine, i.e., protection of the
Russian-speaking minorities, to target one of the countries in the
region, or rely on state-controlled Russian TV channels widely watched
by ethnic Russians in the Baltics to spread propaganda and air true and
imagined grievances.7]{.underline}

[[We're Focused on Ukraine But Look Out For the **Russian Threat to the
Baltics**]{.underline}]{.mark}: It was a shot heard around the world in
the Russian military analysis community. A RAND Corporation simulated
wargame in 2016 concluded that the Russian military could reach the
suburbs of the Estonian and Latvian capitals of Tallinn and Riga in less
than 60 hours. In the iterations of the exercise, the Estonians and
Latvians would need at least seven brigades of troops that include at
least three armored brigades to potentially fight the Russians to a
standstill.

But it gets worse from here. In another RAND wargame in 2019, the
players examined if NATO and Russia would use tactical nuclear weapons
during a simulated war in the Baltic states (Estonia, Latvia, and
Lithuania). The scenario also had Russian conventional forces
over-running capitals in the Balkans and NATO having the last fail-safe
option to use non-strategic nuclear weapons.

What Type of Warfare Could the Russians Use Against the Baltics?

A widespread fear is that [[the Kremlin could use hybrid
warfare]{.underline}]{.mark} (conventional and unconventional aspects of
power projection) [again [to annex parts of the
Baltics]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [which would **trigger Article V** with
NATO allies]{.underline}]{.mark} and would require a military response
against the Russians from NATO members. A glance at a map will tell you
that St. Petersburg is dangerously close to Tallinn, Estonia and Riga,
Latvia. But according to General Valery Gerasimov, the Chief of the
General Staff of the Armed Forces of Russia, [the distinctions between
offensive aspects of war and defensive aspects of war are
blurring.]{.underline}

Under this Gerasimov Doctrine, [[the Kremlin then could engineer a
Russian]{.mark} hybrid [incursion]{.mark} of cyber and [**information
warfare attacks** against the Baltics]{.mark}, and [these tactics could
be]{.mark} made to be [seen as a defensive
operation.]{.mark}]{.underline} Since the Baltics have ethnic Russians
as part of the population, [[Moscow could employ special operations
forces]{.mark} as peacekeepers [to protect
compatriots.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[This could happen with an

Introduction

In recent years, awareness of [[Russian disinfo]{.mark}rmation
activities]{.underline} and disinformation efforts [[has been
**growing**]{.underline}]{.mark} both [[in]{.underline}]{.mark} the West
and in Central and **[[Eastern Europe]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Baumann,
2020; Kuczyńska-Zonik & Tatarenko, 2019). Russian disinformation is
considered to have achieved some success even in the most developed
western countries, where it is presumed to have interfered in the
election campaign in the USA (Golovchenko et al., 2020), harassed and
impeded independent investigations in Western Europe (Aro, 2016), sought
to impair public support for Western assistance to former Soviet
countries (Richey, 2018), and significantly affected the election
campaign in France (Makhashvili, 2017). Among [the **main
targets**]{.underline} [for Russian disinformation are the]{.underline}
former Soviet Union countries that in Russia are referred to by a unique
term coined in 1992, called "**[near abroad]{.underline}**," (ближнее
зарубежье) which attempts to emphasize their status as foreign countries
not fully recognized by Russia (Rotaru, 2018). [[Russian
disinfo]{.mark}rmation]{.underline} in the "near abroad" countries
[seek]{.underline} two main objectives: [to [inflict]{.mark} as much
**[damage to]{.mark} the [statehood]{.mark}** of the target countries
[and]{.mark} to [portray Russia in]{.mark} much **[better
colors]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the eyes of their citizens (Shakrai,
2015), typically by distorting historical events (Ehrlich, 2021).
Although the aim of preventing former Soviet Union Republics from fully
diverging from the Russian sphere of influence (Cooley, 2017; Dunn &
Bobick, 2014), [the Russian Federation has made the Baltic States a
target of **continuous negative disinfo**rmation and **psychological
subversion** tactics]{.underline} (Veebel, 2015), making the
disinformation dominated by negative messaging (Thornton & Karagiannis,
2016). It is even stated that among all the European nations, citizens
of the Baltic States experience the most concentrated and sophisticated
disinformation efforts as an expression of soft power (Simons, 2015).
Such Russian disinformation has been affecting the citizens of the
Baltic States for more than the past three decades. Arguably residents
of the Baltic States are believed to be more susceptible and receptive
to various forms of Russian disinformation, having been subject to some
50 years of Soviet brainwashing (Schuhrke, 2019; Thompson, 2019). [[Such
disinfo]{.mark}rmation [**increases dissatisfaction**
with]{.mark}]{.underline} domestic [[governments]{.underline}]{.mark}
(Golovchenko, 2022) [and the state of **democracy**]{.underline}
generally (Oates, 2016), [lowers incentives for personal
self-development]{.underline} (Benkler et al., 2018), [[and
provokes]{.mark} **[anger]{.mark}** and social **[inequality]{.mark}**
within society]{.underline} (Bardach-Yalov, 2012). [There
are]{.underline} additional [thoroughly documented cases about
the]{.underline} **[[intimidation]{.underline}]{.mark}** [of Baltic
States]{.underline} from the Russian side. Matthews (2020) points out at
[Russian actions aimed at increasing **[ethnic
tensions]{.mark}**]{.underline} within these countries. It becomes
possible because [Baltic States have a significant Russian
minority]{.underline} (Best, 2013). Russia is also fully engaged in
spreading false information about the possible revision of various
treaties between the Baltic States and Russia (Matthews, 2020) up to
revoking the recognition of Lithuanian independence (Labanauskas, 2022).
[[Baltic States]{.mark} also [have been a subject of]{.mark} various
**[cyber-attacks]{.mark}** from Russian based hackers [and]{.mark} are
[expect]{.mark}ed to experience **even [more
sophisticated]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[cyber-warfare]{.underline}]{.mark} activities it [[in a foreseeable
future]{.underline}]{.mark} (Mälksoo, 2018). The position of Baltic
States as a frontline in a cyber-warfare was acknowledged also by NATO
by a decision to establish its cooperative cyber-defense competence
centre of excellence in one of the Baltic States -- Estonia (Kovács,
2018).

In this study the follow the definition of disinformation presented by
Bayer et al. (2019). It covers the spreading of information which is
designed to be false or manipulated or misleading. It also has the
intention of generating insecurity, tearing cohesion or inciting
hostility, or directly to disrupt democratic processes (Bayer et al.,
2019, p. 18).

[Although]{.underline} in recent years, [Russian disinformation reached
the level of]{.underline} "**[strategic information
operations]{.underline}**" (Flanagan et al., 2019), [there have been
very few studies on the **actual effect**]{.underline} of such
disinformation. Completed studies were based on qualitative evaluations
(Surowiec, 2017), focused on Western countries (Carter & Carter, 2021),
or investigated only specific issues -- mostly the Russia-Ukraine
dispute (Gerber & Zavisca, 2016).

Therefore, the present paper aims to evaluate the effect of Russian
disinformation on the Baltic States. In order to assess the latent
variables related to the effect of disinformation activities on
citizens' minds, this paper uses the structural equation modeling method
(SEM), in which a partial least squares technique is employed. To our
knowledge, [[this is the]{.mark} **[first study]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[on the effect of disinfo]{.mark}rmation on the target countries'
populations [using]{.mark} **[sophisticated]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[statistical methods]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The study consists of several parts: the introductory section provides a
brief overview of the aims and impact of Russian disinformation in the
Baltics, the "Materials and Methods" section introduces the research
model and the hypotheses for the study, and the main results are
presented in the "Results" section. Finally, the "Conclusions and
Discussion" section summarizes the insights of the study, juxtaposes it
with the prevailing theoretical streams, and offers directions for
future studies in the subject area.

Theoretical background

There is increasing debate about the socio-political consequences of
negative disinformation. Arguably, [disinformation enables the success
of **populist parties** during election campaigns]{.underline}
(Chernobrov & Briant, 2020) [and affects **political
decisions**]{.underline}, [as politicians are reluctant to take
actions]{.underline} that are potentially [unpopular with]{.underline}
certain [voting groups]{.underline} (Acemoglu et al., 2013) that could
be [subject to]{.underline} various [disinformation tactics]{.underline}
(Van Herpen, 2015). [Prolonged negative disinformation campaigns lower
**public participation**]{.underline} (Bonch-Osmolovskaya, 2015)
[through both increased perception of **negligibility**]{.underline} of
voters actions (Van Herpen, 2015) [and increased **apathy**]{.underline}
(Gulenko, 2021).

[In recent years, the intensity of Russian disinformation has
**substantially increased**]{.underline}, especially on social media
(Prier, 2020). [One of the main aims]{.underline} of destructive Russian
disinformation, which has intensified since 2014, [is to discredit
national authorities by questioning the independence of their actions or
decisions]{.underline} (Lelich, 2014). This leitmotif of the "other hand
ruling the government" has also been applied through information warfare
against another post-soviet country -- Ukraine -- and is considered to
be highly effective (Karlsen, 2016). It also increases citizens'
perception of hostility with respect to the surrounding environment and
diminishes their participation in public life and socio-economic
activity (Irisova, 2015). Furthermore, Russian disinformation in
post-Soviet states boosts nihilism to substantially undermine the
economic activity of their populations, especially with respect to
future gains (Julukhidze, 2020). Nihilism as a result of increased
distrust provoked by Russian disinformation is mentioned by Paul and
Matthews (2019), and Russian disinformation objectives to create and
facilitate distrust in Government were also noticed by Sanovich (2017).
Disinformation also violates the self-identity and perception of justice
(Blouin & Mukand, 2019). Reflections on the exaggerated perception of
corruption within the state apparatus were found to be one of the most
discussed topics (Miller, 2019). The emphasized narrative of the "failed
state" in which everything is decided in advance, and in which citizens
can neither influence policy decisions nor be the masters of their own
personal or career development, is also important for Russian
disinformation architects (Helmus et al., 2018). The
disinformation-related influence of diminished motivation for positive,
personal development has also been mentioned by Smith and Lasswell
(2015).

[Attempting to undermine the perception of safety within the country
through constant intimidation and threat of imminent military actions is
a]{.underline}nother [major tactical aspect of Russian
disinformation]{.underline} (Giles et al., 2015). Although in the short
term, the effect may be opposite to that expected by the disinformation
designers -- a consolidation of the nation in the face of immediate
aggression (Yurkova, 2018), in the long term, [it rewards the
disinformation creators in the form of decreased trust in public
institutions]{.underline} (Haas, 2017) and the state itself (Redley,
2007) in the target country. Such dual effects of disinformation not
only increase the complexity of how it may be detected, (Kausar et al.,
2020) but also make understanding its effects even more puzzling.

It has been noted that although Russian state disinformation is very
effective within Russia itself by forcing the Russian population to
accept a distorted reality, it becomes a counterproductive element
outside Russian borders (Belousov, 2012) where it no longer achieves its
main objectives (Benkler et al., 2018). These contradictions not only
substantiate polemics about the ambiguity of Russian disinformation
outcomes but also add weight to arguments in favor of the present study.

In summary, Russian disinformation in the Baltic States is directed at
increasing the populations" distrust in their governments (Lough et al.,
2014), promoting the perception of a lack of justice (Paul & Matthews,
2016) or career possibilities (Kuczyńska-Zonik, 2017) within the
country, and reinforcing the threat of the imminent military action in
the region (Buinauskas et al., 2016).

Conclusions and discussion

[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} present [[study]{.underline}]{.mark} offers a
solution to one of the main issues in disinformation research -- the
problem of assessing the effectiveness of disinformation (Aggarwal &
Sadana, 2019; Oliinyk & Lyasota, 2018). SEM is confirmed to have
[[derived]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[robust results]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[indicating]{.mark} the presence of **[disinfo]{.mark}**rmation
[influences]{.mark} among [the population]{.mark} of target
countries]{.underline}.

[[This study represents the **first attempt**]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[to]{.mark} clearly [document the]{.mark} negative]{.underline}
economic [[outcomes of Russian disinfo]{.mark}rmation [within the
**Baltic**]{.mark}]{.underline} States. Such adverse effects were
assumed (Molder & Sazonov, 2020), though not yet proven. We discovered
that [[a **constant narrative**]{.underline}]{.mark} from various
information sources related to the imminent nature of military action in
or around the Baltic region (Makarychev, 2020; Veebel & Ploom, 2019)
[[harms]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[**economic** development]{.mark} of
these countries]{.underline} through the reluctance of their citizens to
invest in their domestic economies. The erosion of trust in the
Government also may have far-reaching implications, including an
indirect effect on the economy. [The Baltic States are]{.underline} also
[lagging behind other]{.underline} EU [Member States in terms of
**vaccination**]{.underline} against COVID-19. [This has also been
attributed by some experts to **skepticism**]{.underline} toward
government actions (Genys & Krikstolaitis, 2021). Lower vaccination
rates lead to longer and stricter economic lockdowns, higher spending on
treatment of infected persons, etc. Weakened trust in the Government in
Lithuania, compared to Western States, leads to greater reluctance of
the part of the population to seek public institutions' assistance when
facing a crisis; consequently, Lithuania has the highest rate of suicide
among European countries (Zalsman et al., 2017).

This study additionally confirmed the strong relationship between the
perception of justice within the country and trust in the Government.
Although it is considered a prerequisite for a strong democracy
(Kashwan, 2017), many countries still have failed to ensure social
justice (Lee, 2021). The relationship between perceived career
possibilities and trust in the Government indicates a high level of
paternalism in Baltic States' societies, where the governments are
expected to display a significant level of care, possibly taking
responsibilities that are typically met at the individual level, e.g.,
career development (Vande Griek et al., 2020).

The perceived threat of war, which is one of the main leitmotifs of the
Russian disinformation campaign targeting in the Baltic States (Saxi et
al., 2020), is both found to affect trust in the government, thus
disrupting social stability and coherence (Klumbyte, 2019), and produce
a direct negative economic impact by undermining domestic investment.
Contrary to the popular opinion that consistent awareness of possible
military intervention helps unify society and win its support for
strengthening the armed forces in some of the Baltic States (Romanova et
al., 2020), the results of this study add weight to the differing
opinion that a significant fear of military threat may have more
negative than positive outcomes.

The results of the current study indicate that governments of the Baltic
States ought to pay more attention to measures aimed at countering the
effect of the disinformation efforts of unfriendly nations, as it
affects not only the social landscape but also the economic development
of Baltic nations. Governments may be persuaded to counteract Russian
disinformation more aggressively than up until the present when
counter-disinformation actions were more balanced in favor of ethics
(Bjola, 2018). The present study serves as a starting point for more
comprehensive studies of the economic and social impact of negative
disinformation tactics. In the future, it may be beneficial, both from
scientific and applied perspectives, to investigate the impact of
disinformation on a wider range of aspects of the economic development
of the country in order to develop a more multifaceted and comprehensive
understanding of the destructive outcomes of long-term negative
disinformation. The deeper research into the methods which are being
used by Russia for disinformation campaigns could also help to better
understand and counter the effects of disinformation campaigns and to
minimize its negative impact.

RESILIENCE

Unlike the threats Russia poses in the military realm, [[Moscow's
intimidating NATO]{.mark} allies [through **nonkinetic**
operations]{.mark}]{.underline} across various civilian domains [[cannot
be countered by **traditional** ]{.mark}**military**
[means]{.mark}]{.underline}. Instead of deterrence and defense, civilian
resilience measures are better tools for dealing with most of Russia's
NGW tactics. In particular, [[increasing the **resilience**]{.mark}
[of]{.mark} ethnic Russians in [the Baltic]{.mark} states [to]{.mark}
**Russian [propaganda]{.mark}** [should be]{.mark}come [a **key
feature**]{.mark} [of NATO policy]{.mark}]{.underline}. The example of
Ukraine, though very different compared to the three Baltic states,
shows that existing [[ethnopolitical tensions can serve as a]{.mark}
**[gateway]{.mark}** [for Russian intervention]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[In Ukraine]{.mark}, [Russia exploited]{.mark} **existing
[ethnopolitical]{.mark}** [problems as a **pretext**]{.mark} to resort
to the use [of force]{.mark}]{.underline}. Its methods should lead to
two important realizations: the Kremlin cares about its image on the
global scene, and it is mindful that any narrative justifying
intervention should receive broad domestic support in Russia.9 Both
realizations have implications for managing deliberate as well as
inadvertent escalation pathways. [Prior to an act of aggression against
NATO, [Moscow would]{.mark} have to [create a pretext]{.mark} of a
magnitude [that would]{.mark} **[justify war]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[with the world's most powerful military alliance]{.underline}. While
that seems unlikely, [one cannot exclude the possibility that
**[unrest]{.mark}** in the Baltics involving minority ethnic groups
[could lead to]{.mark} **[inadvertent escalation]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[if]{.mark} **[domestic pressure]{.mark}** [mounts]{.mark} in
Moscow]{.underline}. For NATO, there are not many military options for
mitigating these escalation risks. Deterrence is only applicable in so
far as Russia decides to react to a domestic crisis in the
Baltics---deliberately instigated or randomly occurring---with military
pressure or the use of force.

A more effective approach would be to reduce the initial risk of
domestic unrest as much as possible. Resilience measures could be an
important way to help make minorities more immune to nonkinetic Russian
operations, such as propaganda and disinformation. However, NATO's
current efforts to strengthen resilience focus on preventing disruption
to military deployments to ensure effective deterrence and defense.10
Beyond the military realm, NATO treats resilience as one facet of its
efforts, not a core task.

But [NATO has **several options** as its disposal to **broaden its
resilience portfolio**]{.underline}. To begin with, [[NATO could
provide]{.mark} **technical [assistance]{.mark} funds** [to the Baltic
states]{.mark}]{.underline} to help them build Russian-language media
outlets from the ground up. This assistance should cover capacity
building, program development, public relations, and branding. To be
comprehensive, these efforts should include traditional media
outlets---such as newspapers, television, and radio---as well as social
media and internet resources. The aim would be to provide a
counternarrative to Russian propaganda and help audiences distinguish
between facts and fake news.

While such efforts to build resilience would be much cheaper than most
military options, any positive effects would only be seen in the coming
decades. At the same time, allies might struggle to reach a consensus on
whether NATO, a military alliance, is really the right organization for
a soft power approach, not least because such efforts would run the risk
of being seen as NATO-sponsored propaganda. Since NATO already
cooperates with the EU on resilience,11 Brussels would, perhaps, be
better placed to lead such efforts.

The contentious debate about NATO members' goal to spend 2 percent of
their GDP on defense may unleash positive synergies. Certain allies,
including Germany, argue that nonmilitary measures such as post-conflict
reconstruction, conflict prevention, development aid, and the
integration of refugees contribute to allied security and that NATO
should count spending on them toward the 2 percent target.12 Even though
NATO's secretary general has rebuked German calls,13 allies could make a
virtue out of necessity by encouraging Germany and others to finance and
organize independent Russian-language media outlets and recognizing that
such resilience efforts count toward the target.14

Another option for NATO could be to closely monitor the state of
integration, rights, and treatment of Russian minorities in the Baltics,
and to intervene, perhaps through a special civilian monitoring and
advisory mission, in cases of concern. Such a watchdog institution could
help signal to Russia that NATO is taking the issue seriously. NATO does
not currently play a role on minority rights within member states and is
wary about infringing on members' sovereignty. It could, therefore, be
quite difficult to reach a consensus about allowing NATO to intervene
directly in the domestic policies of its member states. Allies with a
poor track record in terms of democratic institutions and the rule of
law, including Turkey or Hungary (and, to a lesser extent, Poland),
might even view this as a dangerous legal precedent. In addition,
institutionalized monitoring might inadvertently come across as exactly
the kind of stigmatization of the Baltic countries that Russia wishes to
generate.

But NATO is an alliance of shared values, and the integration and fair
treatment of Russian minorities in the Baltic states is too important a
matter to leave unattended. If allies found NATO monitoring to be
unacceptable, they could opt for self-reporting. Obviously,
self-reporting by the Baltic states would have its weaknesses, but such
an approach could be accompanied by behind-the-scenes pressure from
other allies to ensure reports were meaningful. Another option would be
to task the OSCE, which is also concerned with human rights, with an
enhanced monitoring role. The problem there, however, is that Russia has
a veto in that organization.

Increasing the resilience of NATO members against Russian meddling
should not stop with the Baltic states. As Russian attempts to interfere
in the elections of France, the Netherlands, and the United States have
all shown, [[strengthening the **cyber defenses**]{.mark} [of]{.mark}
governmental [agencies]{.mark} as well as political parties [is
a]{.mark} **first [necessary step]{.mark}** [to prevent the]{.mark}
deliberate [leaking of **confidential
info**]{.mark}**rmation**]{.underline}. [[NATO should make]{.mark}
national [resilience]{.mark} measures [in]{.mark} the [cyber]{.mark}
realm **[count]{.mark}**]{.underline} toward the alliance's 2 percent
defense spending target.

Furthermore, [allies need to make their **publics aware** that they are
being influenced by Moscow]{.underline}, either directly or through
proxies. Since a growing number of citizens treat their own governmental
institutions with skepticism, national governments should cooperate, by
sharing information about Russian interference, with independent civil
society groups that are often seen as more credible. This approach
carries the risk of looking like collusion, but it is a risk worth
taking. One of the downsides of NATO focusing so heavily on Russia over
the last few years, though entirely warranted, is a tendency to portray
the Kremlin as an undefeatable "superman," which it clearly is not.
Allies could therefore send a more determined public message to their
own populations that what Moscow is doing is neither new nor significant
enough to bring down Western democracy and the rule of law.

New Realities

Vladimir [Putin's **invasion of [Ukraine]{.mark}**]{.underline} on
February 24, 2022, [[came as a **shock**]{.underline}]{.mark} to many
observers. Few countries in Europe felt affected by the invasion of
Ukraine as much as the Baltic states, which each directly border Russia,
Belarus, or both. They, as well as Poland, had been warning about the
threat of Russian revanchism from the time of their accession to NATO,
but largely to deaf ears within the rest of NATO. Although the Russian
seizure of Crimea in 2014 and aggression in the Donbas region of eastern
Ukraine prompted calls for change within NATO, the practical response
was limited. The invasion and savage ongoing fighting since then have
brought to light various new realities that the Baltic region, NATO, and
the United States will have to contend with going forward.

[The Russian invasion of [Ukraine is a]{.mark} **forceful
[demonstration]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} **[Putin's desire]{.mark}**
[and]{.mark}]{.underline}, critically, [[willingness to change]{.mark}
the [European security]{.mark} environment [through the]{.mark} **[use
of force]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} It is important to recognize
that he has long considered Ukraine to be an inseparable part of Russia
itself. Indeed, Putin has long contended with near-messianic fervor that
Ukraine is not a sovereign nation.1

Beyond Europe, the Kremlin is dissatisfied with the global order more
broadly.2 Indeed, [Russia]{.underline} under Putin [seeks to shape both
the European regional order and the global international order to
reestablish its **great power status**]{.underline}, [reclaim its
**sphere of interest**]{.underline}, [and expand its **strategic depth**
against **NATO**]{.underline}.3 [It sees the current European security
architecture as **illegitimate**]{.underline}, having been established
during a period of Russian weakness. Now, as [Putin]{.underline}
perceives Russia's power to have been re-established, he [seeks to
reassert its strength and **re-negotiate** the regional
order]{.underline}. Russia sees NATO and especially the United States as
threats to its national security. [One of [Putin's]{.mark} key [goals
has been to **fracture**]{.mark} [NATO's]{.mark} political and military
**[cohesion]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and]{.mark} [manifest]{.mark} a
clear example of NATO's **[dysfunction]{.mark}** and waning
relevance]{.underline}. Thus, in an effort to both limit the threat that
NATO is perceived to pose and to improve its own relative strategic
position, [Russia seeks to weaken the Alliance and the West **more
broadly**]{.underline}.

Demonstrated Willingness to Use Military Force

[The ongoing war in [Ukraine]{.mark} **[demonstrates
unequivocally]{.mark}**]{.underline} [that Russia under [Putin is
willing to undertake]{.mark} **[highly risky]{.mark}**]{.underline} [and
**costly** [measures]{.mark}]{.underline} to achieve his strategic aims.
Although the war has thus far taken place outside of NATO borders, Putin
has demonstrated the willingness to use military force on a large scale
to invade another state to achieve his aims. The NATO alliance and its
member states accordingly must adapt to the enhanced possibility that in
the future Russia may choose to employ military force to attack one or
more NATO member states if and when it determines such action to be
advantageous.

In recent years, [[the Kremlin has continued]{.mark} its efforts [to
weaken the Baltic]{.mark} states [through **various
sub-conventional**]{.mark} [methods]{.mark} of conflict,
[including]{.mark} **[political warfare]{.mark}**,
**[info]{.mark}**rmation **[op]{.mark}**eration**[s]{.mark}** accusing
Baltic governments of discriminating]{.underline} against ethnic
Russians, unfavorable energy pricing, [[regular violation of
Baltic]{.mark} state territorial [**waters** and **air
space**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and the abduction of an Estonian security
officer in 2014. Although Russia has not directly threatened the Baltic
states with military action to date, [[the risk of]{.mark} military
[conflict]{.mark} **[cannot be written off]{.mark}** since [the risks of
**deliberate**]{.mark} **Russian [provocations]{.mark}** [or]{.mark} of
**[miscalc]{.mark}**ulation [are high]{.mark}]{.underline}.4

[[Besides miscalc]{.mark}ulation, other [circumstances]{.mark} could
[motivate Putin to threaten]{.mark}]{.underline} or actually undertake
[[military actions against]{.mark} one or more [Baltic]{.mark}
states]{.underline}. [Such [actions]{.mark} could [take the
form]{.mark}]{.underline}, for example, [[of]{.mark} cross-border
incursions, temporary or prolonged [seizure of **small bits**]{.mark}
[of]{.mark} Baltic state [territory]{.mark}, [attacks against]{.mark}
selected Baltic]{.underline} state military and/or
[**[c]{.mark}**ritical **[i]{.mark}**nfrastructure targets
[or]{.mark}]{.underline}, [in the worst case]{.underline},
**[[full-scale]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[invasion]{.mark} and
occupation]{.underline}.

Such circumstances could arise from Russian threat perceptions or,
alternatively, perceived opportunities to improve Russia's self-assessed
strategic position. For example, [[Putin could]{.mark} seek to [take
advantage of Baltic **domestic insecurity**]{.mark}]{.underline}---e.g.,
[**[rising tensions]{.mark}** [between]{.mark} ethnic Russian
[minorities and the governments]{.mark}]{.underline} in Estonia, Latvia,
or (to a lesser extent) Lithuania---[[to]{.mark} **foment** or
**[escalate]{.mark}** [domestic tensions]{.mark}]{.underline} in order
to intimidate the governments or gain influence within those countries.5
Alternatively, Russian perceptions that NATO was attempting to harass or
isolate Kaliningrad could lead Russia to employ military force to assure
its land line of communications with that exclave. Russian perceptions
of a growing NATO military threat in the Baltic Sea or the Gulf of
Finland could lead Russia to respond with military activities with the
consequent risk of miscalculation between opposing forces operating in
close proximity. [[Russia could]{.underline}]{.mark} also
[[conduct]{.mark} limited [incursions to test **NATO's
resolve**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[and]{.mark} potentially [undermine
the]{.mark} **[credibility]{.mark}** [of collective
defense]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[The Kremlin is **threatening to retaliate**]{.mark} against NATO
member state Lithuania, after [the Baltic]{.mark} state decided to
block]{.underline} some [goods into]{.underline} a Russian territory
known as [Kaliningrad]{.underline}.

RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:

As the war in Ukraine stretches into month five, [[things are
getting]{.mark} **more [precarious]{.mark}** for]{.underline} other
[former Soviet republics]{.underline}. Lithuania decided to block some
goods from getting into a Russian territory known as Kaliningrad. And
now the Kremlin is threatening to retaliate. Lithuania, we should note,
is a member of NATO, so there is a lot of dangerous potential in all
this. NPR\'s Charles Maynes is currently in Kaliningrad. And he joins me
now. Hey, Charles.

CHARLES MAYNES, BYLINE: Hi there. Morning.

MARTIN: So set this up for us by explaining more of this territory,
Kaliningrad, and how it has become this source of tension right now.

MAYNES: Sure. You know, Kaliningrad is a territory that was seized from
Germany and became part of the Soviet Union - along with the Baltic
nations of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia - at the end of World War II.
Only amid the push for independence of those countries and breakup of
the USSR in 1991, you know, Kaliningrad became something of an island.
You know, today, it\'s called an exclave. It\'s a separate bit of
Russian territory sandwiched between Lithuania and Poland, which are
both, of course, now European Union and NATO members. But these recent
tensions with Kaliningrad, they really stem from Russia\'s military
campaign in Ukraine and resulting Western sanctions. The problem here is
that Lithuania is also applying those sanctions to goods travelling from
mainland Russia through its territory into Kaliningrad. The Kremlin says
that\'s illegal.

MARTIN: OK, so lots of complications in all of this. You\'re on the
ground there. What have you been hearing from people?

MAYNES: Yeah. You know, so far, the ban only impacts select goods, like
steel, cement, furniture. And as a result, there is an outsized impact
on select industries, like construction and shipping. And that\'s a
point that was made to be - made to me by Yakov Grigoriev, who works in
logistics here.

YAKOV GRIGORIEV: (Non-English language spoken).

MAYNES: So here, Grigoriev says the ban means it costs more to transport
goods. And it takes longer because the only choice is to send everything
from Russia across the Baltic Sea now. You know, meanwhile, others I
talked to say, look; we want good relations with our neighbors. But this
is an unfriendly act against Kaliningrad in particular. And some
long-time residents, like Alexander Sokolov, have theories why.

ALEXANDER SOKOLOV: (Non-English language spoken).

MAYNES: So Sokolov here says that friends in Lithuania tell him their
media portray Russia as about to attack their country. And he says that
couldn\'t be further from the truth. But by building conflict with
Russia, he argues, the authorities in Lithuania can attract additional
money and support from the EU and NATO.

MARTIN: So what is Russia going to do?

MAYNES: Well, you know, [[the Kremlin is issuing **not so
vague**]{.mark} [threats]{.mark} against Lithuania]{.underline}. Local
officials here have a more nuanced take, you know? They say, yes,
Lithuania\'s actions are an inconvenience. But they can work around them
by expanding overseas shipping with more boats.

MARTIN: OK. So if we take a step back here, what does this move by
Lithuania mean in the bigger picture when we think about Russian
aggression into Ukraine and any potential threats into the Baltic states
and Europe?

MAYNES: Yeah. [On the one hand, it looks like it\'s an isolated
incident]{.underline}, right? Lithuanian officials say, look; most
goods, at least for now, can still pass through Kaliningrad, as they
always have. They\'re just enforcing EU sanctions policy. Less clear is
whether the EU entirely agrees, you know? [Amid these
tensions]{.underline}, the EU is now suggesting they create a carve-out
for goods going to Kaliningrad. Meanwhile, [[Lithuania says
it\'s]{.underline}]{.mark} suddenly [[facing]{.mark}
**[cyberattacks]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} **[bomb
threats]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[We\'ve]{.mark} also [seen Russia
carrying out **drills**]{.mark} [among its]{.mark} **[Baltic Sea
fleet]{.mark}**]{.underline}. And until this issue of transit goods to
Kaliningrad is resolved, [[the problem]{.mark} [is]{.mark} just another
[among many that could trigger]{.mark} an **unintended
[conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[between]{.mark} **[NATO]{.mark}**
[and]{.mark} **[Russia]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

#### War's likely now.

[[A **new flashpoint** between NATO and Russia's]{.mark} **new
[expansionism]{.mark}** [flared]{.mark} up [after Lithuania
banned]{.mark}]{.underline} the transit of sanctioned [[goods from
Russia to Kaliningrad]{.mark}, its exclave on the Baltic
Sea]{.underline}, as part of the EU's sanctions regime that took effect
on June 17. [[Russia called Lithuania's actions]{.underline}]{.mark}
"**[[hostile]{.underline}]{.mark}**" [[and]{.underline}
[threatened]{.underline}]{.mark} "**[[serious]{.underline}]{.mark}**"
[[consequences]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Undeterred, Lithuania this weekend blocked an EU motion that would have
nullified the restrictions. Vilnius said that the EU must not succumb to
Russian pressure and compromise on its sanctions package.

NATO leaders meeting in Madrid this week should back up Lithuania's move
to put Russia on the defensive. As a larger strategy, NATO should follow
Lithuania's lead of pressuring Moscow and calling out Moscow's empty
threats.

[[The Kremlin has]{.underline}]{.mark} already
[[responded]{.underline}]{.mark} to Lithuania's restrictions
[[with]{.mark} **[info]{.mark}rmation [war]{.mark}fare**]{.underline}
[[and]{.mark} **[cyber subterfuge]{.mark}**]{.underline}. On Monday, a
[[Russian]{.underline}]{.mark}-speaking [[hacking]{.underline}]{.mark}
group known as Killnet [[claimed responsibility for]{.underline}]{.mark}
part of what Lithuania's Defense Ministry calls
[[an]{.underline}]{.mark} \"**[[intense]{.mark},
[ongoing]{.mark}]{.underline}**\" [[cyberattack against]{.mark}
**[government]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} **[private]{.mark}**
[websites]{.mark}]{.underline}.

This cyberattack tracks with Russia's Ministry of Defense Spokeswoman
Maria Zakharova's warning that Russia's response would be "not
diplomatic, but practical." Kremlin spokeswoman Dmitry Peskov was
similarly critical of the transit restrictions, calling them "illegal."

But the restrictions are in strict accordance with EU law. Lithuania
blocked only the transit of EU-sanctioned goods, like \"metals, coal,
construction materials, and high-technology products to the Russian sea
port.\" Lithuania's Foreign Ministry issued a statement Monday saying
that "the transit of passengers and non-sanctioned goods to and from the
Kaliningrad region through Lithuania continues uninterrupted."

[The Kremlin threats come as [Putin is]{.mark} **[increasingly
open]{.mark}** [about his expansionism]{.mark}]{.underline}. [On
June]{.underline} 9, in a new justification for Russia's war on Ukraine,
[[Putin]{.underline}]{.mark} drew an analogy with Peter the Great's
21-year war with Sweden. He [[said]{.underline}]{.mark}: "[Clearly, [it
fell to our lot to]{.mark} **[return]{.mark}** and
reinforce]{.underline} \[**[[ex-Russian lands]{.underline}]{.mark}**\]
as well." One week later, at the St. Petersburg International Economic
Reform, [Putin asked the world]{.underline}: "[[What is the Soviet
Union]{.mark}? [It is]{.mark} **[historical]{.mark}**
[Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}."

Thirty years ago, [the Soviet Union disintegrated into Russia and 14
separate countries]{.underline}. Today, [in Moscow]{.underline},
[[Kremlin]{.mark}-friendly media [commentators]{.mark} [increasingly
call]{.mark} these [14 nations]{.mark}]{.underline}, including Ukraine,
"**[[quasi-states]{.underline}]{.mark}**." Spoiling for a fight, [[Putin
looks]{.mark} around the map [for]{.mark}]{.underline} a quarrel -- or
**[a [conquest]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [[By keeping Russia on a **war
footing**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[Putin justifies his

In a very recent and insightful study on AI for digital warfare,
Hageback and Hedblom (2022) in their synonymous monograph pose a
fascinating question: what Clausewitz would have thought of digital
warfare.1 Hageback and Hedblom (2022) then correctly note that [the new
digital technology]{.underline} which [we are]{.underline} now [in
possession of has led way to a new digital sphere which **substantially
increases** the speed, reach, stealth, precision, diffusion, and breadth
of a potential attack]{.underline}.2 Much has changed in the realm of
cybersecurity and cyberwar since academic literature first took note.

[[There is]{.mark} **broad [consensus]{.mark}** amongst academics and
policy makers that [the nature of warfare]{.mark} and security [is
changing]{.mark}]{.underline}.3 While this is not disputed, and warfare
changes and progresses with time, this claim should be placed within the
broader notion of a changing geopolitical landscape and a multipolar
world order and in light of Hageback and Hedblom's (2022) aforementioned
observation, [[relating to **digital warfare**]{.mark} [and **cyber
conflict**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Moreover, there is a growing consensus
that within renewed great power competition, the likelihood of a 'great
power war' is enough to resurrect old fears and direct contemporary
security debates. [[Hybrid warfare]{.underline}]{.mark} usually
[**[precedes]{.mark}** [kinetic warfare]{.mark} or take place
simultaneously]{.underline}.4 [[The targets]{.mark} of acts of hybrid
aggression [tend to be **small states**]{.mark}]{.underline} [which are
[geographically near greater powers]{.mark} which seek to dominate
them]{.underline}.5

Thus, [this article focuses on cybersecurity and [**hybrid threats**
fac]{.mark}ing [the]{.mark} three [Baltic]{.mark} states]{.underline},
collectively known as Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. First, I provide a
brief overview of the development of cyber security and hybrid threats
in the region, and a brief synopsis of the current state of affairs and
conclude by offering some policy recommendations. Although the Baltic
states are small states, they carry a big stick when it comes to dealing
with cyber and hybrid threats. This can be used as an advantage not only
internally when dealing with hostile actors in cyberspace, but when
bolstering their voice within NATO and the EU. Estonia has been active
in doing precisely this and Lithuania and Latvia are also answering the
call.

The development of cybersecurity in the Baltic states: Primary
challenges, risks, and lessons learned

Estonia, the small Baltic nation of just over 1.3 million people,
certainly packs a big punch when it comes to all things digital,
becoming the world's most advanced digital society. The small, digital
nation suitably markets itself as 'e-Estonia', with a center bearing the
name. Collectively, the three Baltic states fare very well in
cyber-preparedness. All three are ranked by the Global Cybersecurity
Index (GCI) in the top 20 out of 193 countries. Estonia places third,
after only the United States and the United Kingdom.6 Lithuania is
ranked 6th, whereas Latvia is further down, ranking fifteenth.7
Lithuania and Estonia rank very high in the National Cyber Security
Index (NCSI), among the top ten,8 whereas Latvia is slightly behind,
placing 25th. 9

The aforementioned rankings are both impressive and encouraging.
However, an alarming ranking to be placed within is the ten counties
which are most likely to experience brute-force attacks on Remote
Desktop Protocol (RDP) services.10 RDP brute-force attacks account for
over 80 percent of all network accounts in each of the Baltic states.11
Yet, the Baltic states remain vigilant.

Within the short history of the Baltic states, post-occupation, it has
usually been Estonia leading the charge. However, this is not always the
case. For instance, in 2019, Latvia was among the first countries in
Europe to launch 5G (fifth generation) for commercial use and a year
later opened the first military 5G test site in Europe, located at the
Ādaži military base.12

Lithuania has also been incredibly proactive in facing up to cyber
threats. A recent initiative in the summer of 2021 was the establishment
of the Regional Cyber Defence Centre (RCDC).13 The RCDC operates under
the Lithuanian Ministry of National Defence. The RCDC relies on
bilateral partnerships. Most strongly with the United States, as well as
with Ukraine and Georgia.14 The RCDC is one of two cyber defence centres
in the Baltics, the other being the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence
Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE) in Tallinn.

It is hard to separate technical innovation from what history has taught
the Baltic states, in terms of facing larger powers with nefarious
intentions and a faulty understanding of territorial integrity. Many
academics and policy makers and think tankers have noted the change in
the global power balance, the changing nature of warfare15, as well as
the growing importance of cyberspace as a battleground.16

In 2015, Richard Stiennon warns in his book which bears the candid title
"[[There **Will be Cyberwar**]{.underline}]{.mark}" of precisely this.
Stiennon ends his 2015 publication highlighting geographical
[**[hotspots]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} **potential
[conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline}: the loss of Taiwan, naval defeat in
the South China Sea, and [[the loss of]{.mark} **territory** and
**[sovereignty]{.mark}** [in Eastern Europe to
Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}.17

If 2007 was the initial alarm bell for cyber and hybrid threats in the
Baltics, [2020 and the onset of the global [COVID]{.mark}-19 pandemic
marks a]{.underline}nother [notable date]{.underline}. Two important
reasons underlie this. First, [due to the lockdowns]{.underline} and
social distancing practices enacted across most of the globe and in all
Western democracies, [education]{.underline}, higher education
[and]{.underline} a great degree of [business was moved
online]{.underline}.18 Therefore, [online platforms became]{.underline}
'[the new normal and were utilized to a much greater extent, leading to
the possibility of greater cyber threats]{.underline}. In the EU, major
cyberattacks jumped from 146 in 2019 to 304 in 2020.19
[This]{.underline} is something that Welscher (2021) argues
[has]{.underline} both [[reshaped cyberspaces]{.underline}]{.mark} as a
whole [[and presented]{.mark} **[new threats]{.mark}**]{.underline} [to
the Baltic states]{.underline}.20 There has been time to catch up and
adjust. However, initially, due to the rapid move online, security
became an afterthought in much of Europe.21 [[Cybercrime increased
losses]{.underline}]{.mark} on a global scale [[by]{.underline}]{.mark}
more than **[[50 percent]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[hitting]{.mark} also
[the Baltic]{.mark} states]{.underline}.22 This highlights the dire
importance of remaining not just cyber-prepared, but one step ahead.

Second, and [pertaining to hybrid and information warfare]{.underline},
both the increased amount of time people spend online during the ongoing
pandemic as well as the ripe nature of a crisis of such magnitude for
[[the spread of **misinfo**]{.mark}rmation, **disinfo**rmation, and
**conspiracy theories** [highlight **crucial
vulnerabilities**]{.mark}]{.underline}. A 2021 report for the European
Commission found, perhaps unsurprisingly, that the COVID-19 pandemic
served as a catalyst for conspiracy theories.23 This at a time of
extreme political and social polarization, coupled with preference
bubbles and echo chambers, which allow misinformation and disinformation
to both travel and be accepted by a wider audience. Though, with threats
also come solutions, better resilience, and the possibility for a united
front and further cooperation with allies.

In light of power competition vis-à-vis cooperation with the US, NATO,
and the EU, and small states standing up to larger powers with nefarious
intentions, the drawback is that no entity is capable of defeating all
cyberattacks; rather, in order to succeed in cyberspace, the key is
learning how to adequately cope.24 [When it comes to information
warfare, and one of the reasons for which it is so dangerous, is that
the antagonist **need not win**]{.underline} -- [they succeed if they
are able to successfully **cloud the issue**]{.underline}.25 [It is no
secret that [Russia has waged]{.mark} **[numerous]{.mark}
[info]{.mark}rmation [war]{.mark}fare**]{.underline} [[campaigns]{.mark}
in the Baltics [and show]{.mark} **[no sign of giving
up]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

#### Critical infrastructure escalates.

THREATS AND DANGERS

[[There are]{.underline}]{.mark} mainly three kinds of
[**[threats]{.mark}** [to **c**]{.mark}ritical
**i**nfrastructure]{.underline} -- [[emanating from]{.underline}]{.mark}
nature, technology failures (usually mixed human error), or **[[hostile
action]{.underline}]{.mark}**. All these have shaped the understanding
of the public, as seen from the discussions in the press, and mainly the
last one is reflected in strategy documents in the Baltic states.

With the highest peak of only 318 m over sea level, the Baltic states
are flat. The countries are not situated in a seismically active region,
neither are they threatened by tsunamis or tornados. However, there are
still some natural hazards to critical infrastructure and power supply,
mostly caused by the cold or stormy Northern European weather. While
floods are usually not dangerous and at some places even considered to
be a tourist attraction (Pamarys region  in Lithuania and Soomaa in
Estonia), the autumn and winter storms can be more dangerous, especially
in Estonia. While short term power cuts and the inaccessibility of roads
are usual and appear every year with both the authorities and population
well prepared for them, from time to time things get more extreme. In
December 2010, almost 600 people were stuck in their cars in the
snowstorm on Tallinn-- Narva road. One of the main roads of the country
was blocked for a day and it was a close call that nobody froze to
death. Rough weather in Southern Estonia in December 2019 disrupted the
power supply of over 50  000 clients and took days to fix. However,
although events like these do happen in the Baltic states, they do not
have disastrous effects on infrastructure.13

The COVID-19 pandemic has brought different kinds of problems, although
also emanating from nature. The closure of some borders, especially at
the beginning of the pandemic in spring 2020, showed the international
transport connections -- and therefore vital supplies -- of the Baltic
states may be at risk. Secondly, the pandemic revealed that compulsory
self-isolation of persons having been in contact with an infected person
might lead to unexpected consequences in companies providing vital
services, since many jobs needed to keep the critical infrastructure
maintained and smoothy functioning cannot be run from a distance.

Technological accidents (except the sinking of m/s Estonia caused by
technology failure and extreme weather conditions in 1994, which was a
part of international transport connecting Tallinn to Stockholm) have
not seriously influenced the critical infrastructure, however, all
countries are situated within the range between 500 to 1000 kilometres
from the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, the place of the humankind's
worst technological disaster back in 1986. It has held the threat
perception high, especially in Lithuania, even more so since Belarus has
built the Astravec Nuclear Power Plant just on the other side of the
border, only some 40 kilometres away from the capital Vilnius.14

[[Most threats]{.underline}]{.mark}, both [[to]{.underline}]{.mark}
security in general and [**[c]{.mark}**ritical
**[i]{.mark}**nfrastructure]{.underline} in particular, [are perceived
to [originate from **hostile intent**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Although the
New York attacks of 2001 were noticed and taken into consideration [[in
the Baltics]{.underline}]{.mark},15 there have been no serious incidents
defined as terrorist attacks (although bomb explosions, usually with
criminal motives, were rather common in the 1990s). Still, there have
been acts of Islamist terrorism in Northern Europe.

Other hybrid threats are more plausible. [[Russia's
**aggression**]{.underline}]{.mark} against Georgia in 2008 and Ukraine
since 2014 [[have made these threats **perceptible**]{.mark} for both
the decision-makers and the public]{.underline}. However, the Baltic
states have some experience in materialising hybrid threats. In 2007,
Estonia was under diplomatic, economic and informational pressure from
Russia, which also applied its secret services and proxies, leading to
riots in Tallinn in late April. These activities climaxed with the wide
spectrum of cyberattacks against targets in Estonia -- the first such
occurrence becoming more common in the following years.16 Lithuania --
and to a lesser extent Latvia --were hit by Belarus deliberately
directing migrant flow to their borders, also accompanied by a massive
information campaign, in 2021.17 At the time this article is written it
cannot be stated that the crisis is over.

[[There have been some **concerns**]{.mark} lately over security aspects
[of the]{.mark}]{.underline} People's Republic of China
(**[[PRC]{.underline}]{.mark}**) foreign investments into critical
infrastructure. The concerns have involved 5G technology, but also the
transport infrastructure. There was an initiative to build a railway
tunnel using PRC investments, technology and labour between Tallinn and
Helsinki as an extension of the Rail Baltica line, and therefore of
importance to all Baltic states. However, it was turned down by the
Finnish and Estonian governments in April 2021, after finding the offer
suspicious. If the implementation of the tunnel idea continues, it will
be handled in cooperation between the abovementioned governments.18

RECOMMENDATIONS

[[The need for securing]{.mark} the **[c]{.mark}**ritical
**[i]{.mark}**nfrastructure [has been **well acknowledged**]{.mark} in
the Baltic states [and]{.mark} has been
**[progressing]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[however]{.underline}]{.mark},
**[[no system is perfect]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

While planning and implementing measures to secure the critical
infrastructure, the whole spectrum of natural and technological threats
must be kept in mind. Last not least, threats originating from hostile
action from state and non-state actors -- hybrid threats -- are to be
considered. Due to their geographical location, natural disasters have a
low probability in [[the Baltic]{.mark} states]{.underline}, on the
other hand, the same location [[causes a rather]{.mark} **[high
probability]{.mark}** [of hybrid threats]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The most critical infrastructure systems for modern societies are
[**[power supply]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} **[IT]{.mark} systems**, their
[security is **paramount**]{.mark} to keep everything else
running]{.underline}. [[Securing their **continuity of
operation**]{.mark} and **resilience** [against]{.mark} foreign
influence by politically manipulated restrictions on supply,
[cyber]{.mark} and physical [attacks is
**crucial**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[To secure]{.mark} the **[resilience]{.mark}** of vital
services]{.underline}, **[[smooth coordination]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[between different countries]{.underline}]{.mark}, state agencies and
private critical service providers [[is needed]{.underline}]{.mark}. Of
course, it must be regulated and planned, but to be sure, it works, and
overcoming the bottlenecks not foreseen by regulators and planning the
exercises regularly is also of utmost importance. These should involve
-- not necessarily at the same time -- all levels from the

[Latvia's yearly security assessment named China a **growing** cyber and
espionage threat]{.underline}, alongside risks posed by Russia's
historical revisionism and foreign policy. Warsaw Institute, a think
tank in Poland, analyses the report.

Chinese influence in the Baltics

At the end of April, the Constitution Protection Bureau (SAB), Latvia's
most important intelligence service, published an annual report,
reviewing threats to the national security of their country.

A major part of the report concerned the threat from the Russian
Federation, but there were also several references to the increasing
influence and attacks from China.

In comparison, China was not mentioned in the 2017 document at all, and
in 2018 Beijing's cyber operations aimed at obtaining data, mainly
through economic intelligence, were mentioned.

[[China, **on**]{.mark} **a [par]{.mark}** [with Russia]{.mark},
[was]{.mark}]{.underline} mentioned as [[the **main cyber
threat**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[to NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} and the
European Union.

According to the report, [[the number of Beijing's cyber attacks
is]{.underline}]{.mark} gradually **[[increasing]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[and poses a]{.mark} **[serious problem]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[for
the security]{.mark} and interests [of **Latvia**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[and other **Western countries**]{.underline}. SAB [analysts estimate
that this **trend will continue**]{.underline}.

Over the last five years [[China has invested in tools to]{.mark}
**organise**]{.underline}, **[[centralise]{.underline}]{.mark}** [and
**streamline** [cyber activities]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Hacker groups
controlled by the [Chinese secret service]{.mark}s have]{.underline}
evaluated their operational methods and [improved their technical
tools]{.underline}. The report also notes that [China's
[cyber]{.mark}space [operations have become more]{.mark} **technically
[sophisticated]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and]{.mark} **[difficult to
detect]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

China's cyber attacks also threaten the economic interests of the West.
Such operations are carried out against public institutions, private
companies, the academic community, government institutions, the military
and defence sector and non-governmental organisations.

The most common motive for attacks is to increase the competitiveness of
China's economy. However, there is also a significant increase in
attacks on foreign and security policy-making institutions, which are
aimed at obtaining information about policies and plans of countries
that Beijing sees as strategically important.

[Russia's annexation of Crimea]{.underline} in March 2014
[corroborated]{.underline} **[Moscow's imperialist
pursuits]{.underline}** to restore its role amongst the world's actors
it had lost after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. The [Crimea
case]{.underline} seems now [a good starting point for current thoughts
on]{.underline} the very essence of **[hybrid threats]{.underline}**.
This is what pushed the Baltic republics towards adjusting their
security policies to genuine hybrid threats from the Russian Federation,
a blow to their sovereignty, independence, and integrity with Western
security
agencies[\[4\]](applewebdata://3B002A7F-26A5-4E82-AB99-6FCC85AF4BFC#_ftn4).
Baltic [special services]{.underline} [precisely identified]{.underline}
[these threats in their reports]{.underline}, which confirms how
situationally aware they are. [This]{.underline} [also
places]{.underline} **[Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia]{.underline}** [on
the list of participants of a]{.underline}n unofficial albeit [ongoing
hybrid conflict between]{.underline} EU/[NATO states and
Russia]{.underline}.

As a conflict, Russia's hybrid warfare against European Union (EU)
nations and the North Atlantic Alliance, or NATO, is uneasy to define.
What awakens research curiosity is the adjective hybrid. It is difficult
to find a more dynamically developing concept in security studies
than hybrid threat. Linguists define hybrid as "something that is a
mixture of different elements, often not matching each
other[\[5\]](applewebdata://3B002A7F-26A5-4E82-AB99-6FCC85AF4BFC#_ftn5)."
Thus, in military strategy, hybrid activities are a combination of
symmetric and asymmetric
war[\[6\]](applewebdata://3B002A7F-26A5-4E82-AB99-6FCC85AF4BFC#_ftn6).
Among the available definitions of a hybrid threat, perhaps the most
complex one is that of the European External Action Service, labeling
hybrid threats as a combination of "conventional and unconventional,
military and non-military activities that can be used in a coordinated
manner by state or non-state actors to achieve specific political
objectives." Their diversity consists in the use of tools and tactics
"designed to be difficult to detect or attribute," and "seeking to
create confusion to hinder swift and effective decision-making"
targeting "critical vulnerabilities." Hybrid threats "can range from
[cyberattacks on critical information systems]{.underline}, through the
disruption of critical [services such as energy supplies or financial
services]{.underline}, to the [undermining of public trust in government
institutions]{.underline} or the [deepening of social
divisions]{.underline}[\[7\]](applewebdata://3B002A7F-26A5-4E82-AB99-6FCC85AF4BFC#_ftn7)."

Furthermore, the European Center of Excellence for Combating Hybrid
Threats defined hybrid threats as "coordinated and synchronized action,
that deliberately targets democratic states' and institutions systemic
vulnerabilities, through a wide range of means." As the effectiveness
depends much on the activities below the thresholds of detection and
attribution, any security forces find it either difficult or impossible
to deliver an unambiguous defense reaction. Those who present hybrid
threats draw the blurred line between concepts like war and peace, ally
and enemy, or national or international sphere, both in legal aspects
and by their definitions. The top aim of the activity is to influence
different forms of decision making at the local, state, or institutional
level to favor and gain the agent's strategic goals while undermining
and hurting the target.

A range of components behind hybrid threats is still ready for new
additions as the security environment is undergoing dynamic shifts
bringing in new facts to the definition.

GEOPOLITICAL FEATURES OF THE BALTIC SEA

With the surface area totaling 415,266 square kilometers, or twice as
much as the total area of Belarus, the Baltic Sea consists of a few
regions and basins----the Baltic Proper, the Bothnian Sea, the Gulfs of
Bothnia, Finland, and Riga. It drains through the Danish straits of the
Sound, the Great Belt, and the Little Belt----all of them laying close
to the Jutland Peninsula and the Kattegat and Skagerrak straits that
separate the Baltic Sea and the North Sea. The Baltic Sea features also
some islands being of key importance for geostrategic control of the
body of water: Finland's Åland Islands, Estonia's Hiiumaa and Saaremaa,
Sweden's Gotland, and Denmark's Bornholm.

[The Baltic]{.underline} Sea [is one of the **top directions for
Russia's foreign and security policies** while also being where Moscow
is pursuing its **vital interests**]{.underline}. In the northern part
of the Baltic Sea lies St. Petersburg, a Russian city at the head of the
Gulf of Finland, and in the south, there is Kaliningrad Oblast, the
country's military exclave in this part of Europe and its somewhat
"window to the West." **[This allows Russia]{.underline}** [to embolden
its military presence in the Baltic Sea and have a real impact on
the]{.underline} energy **[security of]{.underline}** both **[countries
in the region]{.underline}** and the whole European Union.

[Running along the Baltic Sea]{.underline} from Vyborg, Russia to
Lubmin, Germany, with an [annual capacity of 55 billion cubic meters
(bcm) of natural gas,]{.underline} the Nord Stream 1 energy link and its
sister pipeline, Nord Stream 2, with a similar capacity and set to
become operational soon, both bypass Central and Eastern Europe,
including [the Baltic countries]{.underline}. [For the
Kremlin]{.underline}, [the project is of both political and commercial
importance while opening up an alternative route for natural gas
flows]{.underline} to Western Europe to go around transit nations like
Ukraine[\[8\]](applewebdata://3B002A7F-26A5-4E82-AB99-6FCC85AF4BFC#_ftn8).

Owing to Cold War-era ties between Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia on the
one hand and Russia on the other, **[the region is now a
battlefield]{.underline}** **[where Moscow is seeking to reconstruct its
post-Soviet sphere of influence]{.underline}**. [So far Russia has
revealed its expansive feats there]{.underline}, also by dispatching
forces of the Western Military District of the Armed Forces of the
Russian Federation, also that of the Baltic Fleet, headquartered in
Baltiysk, Kaliningrad, a move that overwhelmed Estonia, Lithuania, and
Latvia with a feeling of danger. Besides Russia, amongst the countries
enclosing the Baltic Sea are also eight EU member states, of which six
belong to the North Atlantic Alliance. Sweden and Finland----both of
which are openly seeking to strengthen military ties with both the North
Atlantic Alliance and the EU's Permanent Structured Cooperation
(PESCO)----side with the military bloc in the event of a potential
conflict. Going further, if a major confrontation arose between Russia
and NATO, geopolitically the Baltic Sea might be almost wholly out of
control of the Russian
Federation[\[9\]](applewebdata://3B002A7F-26A5-4E82-AB99-6FCC85AF4BFC#_ftn9).

These brief features of the [Baltic Sea]{.underline} explain [how
geopolitically salient the body of water is in an all-out rivalry
between Russia and Western nations.]{.underline} Besides, in this
report, the geopolitical perspective of the Baltic Sea is fundamental to
analyze both current and possible hybrid threats to the security of the
Baltic nations, as thoroughly outlined in papers published by their
special services.

**[COMMON HYBRID THREATS OF THE BALTIC STATES]{.underline}**

The content of the security and risk assessment reports by the special
services of the Baltic states allows us to outline a common denominator
for their security environment and draft a universal repertoire of
current hybrid threats for the three republics.

1\. [Russia represents the most serious hybrid threats to the internal
security and constitutional order of the Baltic nations.]{.underline}
The Kremlin's belligerent foreign and security policies are [linked to
the country's imperialist pursuit to rebuild its position in the Baltic
Sea and move its sphere of influence further]{.underline}, to stretch to
the Baltics, [a move that generates threats to the raison d'Etat of
Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia.\]{.underline}
2. In doing so, **[Moscow]{.underline}** has at its disposal **[special
services]{.underline}**----as tools for going ahead with its foreign and
security policies towards the Baltic nations to pose the biggest threat
possible to both the internal security and constitutional order of
Latvia, Lithuania, and
Estonia[\[10\]](applewebdata://3B002A7F-26A5-4E82-AB99-6FCC85AF4BFC#_ftn10).
In their **[reports]{.underline}**, all Baltic special services
**[insist on]{.underline}** the destructive nature of the activities
performed jointly by the Russian intelligence services and their
Belarusian peers. Posed by the FSB, GRU, and SVR, [hybrid threats to
Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia target a number of areas, notably
politics, diplomacy, military, economy, energy, society, and culture.
Russian]{.underline} [intelligence services' activities]{.underline}
[are tracked]{.underline} mainly in Russia, but also the Commonwealth of
Independent States, or CIS. Both the FSB and the GRU are [actively
recruiting Baltic
nationals]{.underline}[\[11\]](applewebdata://3B002A7F-26A5-4E82-AB99-6FCC85AF4BFC#_ftn11).
All spying cases disclosed so far in the Baltic States refer to any
activities for the benefit of either the Russian Federation or the
Republic of Belarus.\
3[. In the reports]{.underline}, their authors place in spotlight
[Moscow's]{.underline} hybrid actions against the Baltic nations as
being part of a broader security and foreign strategy, with the
following [key goals:\]{.underline}
a) impeding NATO's expansion toward Russia's borders, in the Baltic Sea,
the Caucasus, and the Balkans;\
b) [**disintegrating the**]{.underline} European Union, undermining its
**[democracy-based legal order]{.underline}**, and [taking advantage of
any situations that bring to the fore chasms between individual bloc
members]{.underline};\
c) promoting international cooperation between Russia and EU states,
based on bilateral ties, and not collegial supranational bodies;\
d) building Russia's image of a "besieged fortress" among European
societies by igniting Russophobic moods, a move that integrates and
solidifies Russian-speaking communities in these countries, and shifts
the perception of Russian foreign policy among members of Russian
society.

4\. The level of threat from terrorism is low in all three Baltic
nations----and so is the likelihood of a terrorist attack. Although
other European countries note higher threats levels from right-wing
militants, Islamic insurgents, and terror groups, the Baltic countries
are now a little interesting target for terrorists. In their reports,
security services in Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia cast a spotlight on
a couple of examples where foreign-inspired political and religious
extremism came to the fore, with other powers or groups like IS.\
5. [The military facet of hybrid threats]{.underline} **[wholly
addressed to the North Atlantic Alliance]{.underline}** [refers notably
to the Baltic nations.]{.underline} In the Russian deterrence strategy,
Kremlin senior officials do not resort exclusively to dispatching troops
to the Western Military District and carrying out full-scale offensive
drills[\[12\]](applewebdata://3B002A7F-26A5-4E82-AB99-6FCC85AF4BFC#_ftn12).
Russia consequently creates perilous situations by holding Baltic Fleet
war-gaming exercises right off the coasts of other countries or by
repeatedly intruding their airspace.\
6. Latvian, Estonian, and Lithuanian cyberspace is one of the top
targets for [Russian special services]{.underline} and related agents.
In 2007, [Estonia]{.underline} [became the target of a coordinated cyber
attack]{.underline}, [the starting point of the cyber war era that made
cyberspace a permanent feature of the critical state
administration]{.underline}[[\[13\]]{.underline}](applewebdata://3B002A7F-26A5-4E82-AB99-6FCC85AF4BFC#_ftn13).
Both VDD and KAPO reported most spying cases among Russian-based hacking
groups targeting essentially state and local government institutions and
critical infrastructure agencies. In their analyses, VSD and AOTD paid
attention to the cyber espionage of Russian intelligence agencies,
including the GRU group Sofacy/APT28 and the FSB group Agentbtz/Snake,
adding they might employ the fifth-generation (5G) communication
technology for cyber espionage. What Lithuania has experienced reveals
that Russian special services use the online space to wage
disinformation campaigns against defense sectors in the Baltic countries
to disgrace them in the eyes of other NATO states. Besides, special
services of the Baltic republics pinpointed in their reports a set of
intelligence and cyber threats from the People's Republic of China.\
7. In its report, Latvia's VDD draws attention to plausible risks
originating from what is referred to as Latvian cross-border projects
with Russian entities. Latvian municipalities see their cooperation with
Russian agencies being part of cross-border projects as risky due to
likely espionage perils and their repercussions for the state internal
security. Just to cite here an example that involved placing CCTV
cameras, an idea put forward by the Pskov region administration, for
monitoring natural resources off the Latvian lake districts that the
country's State Security Service eyes as an evident attempt to install
spying devices in Latvia to gather intelligence data.

8\. According to data from the general population census of 2011, 5.8
percent of Lithuanians were ethnic
Russians[\[14\]](applewebdata://3B002A7F-26A5-4E82-AB99-6FCC85AF4BFC#_ftn14),
compared to 26.9 percent (2011) and 24.6
percent[\[15\]](applewebdata://3B002A7F-26A5-4E82-AB99-6FCC85AF4BFC#_ftn15) (2020)
in Latvia and Estonia
respectively[\[16\]](applewebdata://3B002A7F-26A5-4E82-AB99-6FCC85AF4BFC#_ftn16).
Russian state agencies seek to integrate Russian-speaking groups in both
Latvia and Estonia by using aggressive historical propaganda to promote
a positive image of both the Soviet Union and Russia, which poses one of
the biggest threats to these states and their constitutional order.
Russian diplomats in Riga and Tallinn are also taking active steps to
solidify members of the Russian minority, also through agencies like the
Russkiy Mir Foundation or
Rossotrudnichestvo[\[17\]](applewebdata://3B002A7F-26A5-4E82-AB99-6FCC85AF4BFC#_ftn17).
Efforts to protect ethnic Russians living in the Baltic countries go
hand in hand with the Russian hybrid activities that seek to gain the
favor of these groups for the Kremlin's belligerent foreign course and
create a positive image of the Russian authorities amongst people in
Russia.\
9. Pro-Russian NGOs and public entities take advantage of the benefits
of democracy and freedom of speech to produce an accusatory narrative
against Latvian and Estonian officials, balking at them over their
alleged discriminatory moves against ethnic Russians in both countries.
Behind these feats are both Russian diplomats and special services that
look to discredit these states in the eyes of other countries around the
globe. At a later stage of hybrid activities, Russian-made rhetoric
equips Moscow with a comfortable pretext to conceal actions aimed at
"protecting an oppressed minority," a Kremlin solution that played out
first in Georgia in 2008, and then in Ukraine in 2014. Any response from
Latvian or Estonian officials to these statements is met with
accusations of Russophobia, suppression of freedom of speech, human
rights abuse, and promoting
fascism[\[18\]](applewebdata://3B002A7F-26A5-4E82-AB99-6FCC85AF4BFC#_ftn18).\
10. Russia is also going ahead with alluring Russian-speaking young
people in the Baltic countries to become members of pro-Russian
institutions like the Latvian Council of Civic Organisations (LSOP) or
the Union of Associations of the Russian Minority in
Estonia[\[19\]](applewebdata://3B002A7F-26A5-4E82-AB99-6FCC85AF4BFC#_ftn19).
One more example of Russia's hybrid activities is an effort to promote
an educational offer to encourage young Russian speakers in the Baltic
countries to study at universities across Russia. Both Latvia's VDD and
Estonia's KAPO also warn against Russian efforts to recruit alumni, also
those of the Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO).\
11. Numerous reports by the Baltic special services focus on the
Kremlin's aggressive information policy, historical propaganda, and
disinformation campaigns staged by the country's senior
officials[\[20\]](applewebdata://3B002A7F-26A5-4E82-AB99-6FCC85AF4BFC#_ftn20).
Russia's politics of history has a clear goal: to emphasize the Soviet
contribution to the development of the Baltic states while denying their
annexation and then occupation. With this narrative, Russia insists on
the ties between the former Soviet republics and the Russian Federation,
which serves as an attempt to drag them into countries being Moscow's
exclusive sphere of influence. Russia mobilizes historical propaganda
messages in the Baltic states to promote its version of history, notably
that of World War
II[\[21\]](applewebdata://3B002A7F-26A5-4E82-AB99-6FCC85AF4BFC#_ftn21).
In the Russian-made information engineering that constructs the politics
of history, the Kremlin tends to resort to the following tools: a)
consistent moves to reinterpret past events to make Russia a hero and a
liberator, and not an aggressor and occupant, b) erecting new monuments
to the Red Army and renovating already existing ones, c) offering
(financial) aid to historical events as an opportunity to depict the
Russian version of history, d) using media outlets to air television
shows aligned with the Russian historical propaganda.\
12. Russia is constantly interfering with political processes in the
Baltics by backing political parties being close to the Kremlin's
current political interest. Estonia's KAPO has drafted a list of
pro-Russian political parties and Russian-backed
NGOs[\[22\]](applewebdata://3B002A7F-26A5-4E82-AB99-6FCC85AF4BFC#_ftn22),
both serving as a comfortable channel for Russian officials. In
Lithuania, special services did not spot any Russian attempt to meddle
in the 2019 parliamentary vote yet with its propaganda tools, Moscow
waged disinformation campaigns to discard the image of Lithuanian
politicians expressing a negative view of Moscow's current policy.\
13. The Kremlin makes intensive use of public diplomacy in the Baltic
nations and other countries to introduce top-down guidelines in its
propaganda and information strategies, thus to pose more hybrid threats.
One example is Russian-staged events to make the public opinion shift
its stance on the annexation of Crimea and give consent to the status
quo in the peninsula. Russia's propaganda apparatus skillfully takes
advantage of the fact that foreign officials attend these meetings,
portraying this as a sign of international support for Russia's feats in
Crimea, a step that fits into Moscow's strategic thought and sustains
the Kremlin's narrative of information policy. In the report,
Lithuania's VSD stands firm that such Russian-held conferences open up
an opportunity for the country's special services to recruit new sources
that might possibly operate for Russia.\
14. In its hybrid war against the Baltic nations, Russia has a number of
legal and institutional tools----like issuing passports or launching
repatriation programs. By simplifying legal procedures to acquire
Russian citizenship, or passport, Russia reaps a double benefit. First,
this comes as an alluring offer for ethnic Russians in Estonia and
Lithuania and the whole undertaking increases the share of Russian
nationals in the total population of these states. Also, this
legitimizes the narrative of the information policy pursued by the
Russian propaganda apparatus. Besides, by looking for new citizens
outside the country, Russia is trying to tackle the demographic crisis
at
home[\[23\]](applewebdata://3B002A7F-26A5-4E82-AB99-6FCC85AF4BFC#_ftn23).
Also, through its repatriation program in Estonia, Russian officials
sought to convince members of local Russian-speaking groups to return to
their "true homeland." In the report, Estonia's KAPO even mocked at the
failed undertaking.\
15. Economic security is what is of critical importance for the
functioning and development of the Baltic countries. Russia consistently
balks at infrastructure projects in the Baltic republics----such as Rail
Baltica----chiding at them as unprofitable and unsustainable while
arguing it develops anti-Russian military infrastructure. Nonetheless,
diversifying energy supplies, adding new directions, and expanding the
gas pipeline network (Balticconnector) or energy infrastructure projects
(EU-wide Connecting Europe Facility) are all vital for the security of
the Baltic nations. Also, the electricity systems of the Baltic states
and Russia are tightly interconnected and integrated into the BRELL
(Belarus, Russia, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania) electrical grid that
enables Russia to control the frequency regulation and thus put pressure
on the Baltic
countries[\[24\]](applewebdata://3B002A7F-26A5-4E82-AB99-6FCC85AF4BFC#_ftn24).
The energy sector in the Baltics is still a target of Russian cyber
attacks. Russia is sparing no efforts to make the Baltic republics fully
reliant on its energy flows while rebuilding the energy security
architecture in the Baltic Sea with projects like Nord Stream and its
sister gas pipeline Nord Stream 2. Russian feats are also met with
resistance from other countries and EU bodies; just to cite here that
Germany's Federal Network Agency rejected the project's request for a
pass from a new EU gas
directive[\[25\]](applewebdata://3B002A7F-26A5-4E82-AB99-6FCC85AF4BFC#_ftn25).
One notable example is also the Belarusian nuclear power
plant----located some 55 kilometers off Vilnius----that got funds from
Russia and violates international safety requirements. In its report,
the International Atomic Energy Agency, or IAEA, wrote that the nuclear
facility presents a real threat to the Baltic states and whole Central
and Eastern Europe.

CONCLUSIONS AND FORECASTS      

The analysis of the current hybrid threats to the Baltic states ---- as
outlined in the special service reports ---- makes it possible to
deliver an overview of conclusions and forecasts.

1\. [The Russian Federation poses most hybrid threats to the Baltic
nations, a state of affairs that is unlikely to shift anyhow
soon.]{.underline} The interference of Russia's special services into
the Baltic republics and their state apparatuses is permanent, wields
varied tools, and touches upon multiple sectors. All undertakings in
this area come as part of the Kremlin's foreign and security policy
strategy to strengthen its international position, pursue vital national
interests, and protect Russian raison d'Etat.\
2.Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 was a trigger that radically
changed the perception of the security in the Baltic countries while
their senior officials grew aware of a real threat posed by Russia's
expansionist foreign policy and plausible military aggression**[.
Russia's entering the peninsula also showed the true face of Putin's
imperialist policy and his Pan-Slavic doctrine]{.underline}**. [Russia's
hybrid activities against the Baltic nations are very perilous if they
either go unnoticed or get downplayed before fully identifying them as
threats.\]{.underline}
3. [Being]{.underline} EU and [NATO members]{.underline} and hosting
allied forces on their soil, [the Baltic countries reduce the risk of a
potential conflict]{.underline} or other aggression from the Russian
Federation. **[But with the growth in intensity, scale, variety, and
multiple nature of hybrid threats]{.underline}** [Russia continues to
pose to the Baltic countries]{.underline}, [there rises the future
possibility of a hybrid war]{.underline} [**into conventional
aggression**]{.underline} and a repeat of the Crimea scenario throughout
the whole Baltics or in just one of them, for instance in Latvia.

//AShah

Would the US fight a nuclear war to save Estonia? The question would
probably strike most Americans as absurd. Certainly, almost no one was
thinking about such a prospect when NATO expanded to include the Baltic
states back in 2004.

Yet a series of reports by the nonpartisan RAND Corporation shows that
[[the possibility of **nuclear escalation** in a conflict
between]{.mark} the **[N]{.mark}**orth **[A]{.mark}**tlantic
**[T]{.mark}**reaty **[O]{.mark}**rganization [and Russia over the
**Baltic**]{.mark} **region** [is **high**]{.mark}]{.underline}er than
one might imagine. The best way of averting it? Invest more in the
alliance's conventional defense.

There was a time when it seemed quite normal to risk nuclear war over
the sanctity of European frontiers. During the Cold War, NATO was
outnumbered by Warsaw Pact forces, and it would have had great
difficulty stopping a Soviet attack with conventional weapons. [From the
moment it was formed, NATO relied on the threat of nuclear escalation
--- whether rapid and spasmodic, or gradual and controlled --- to
maintain deterrence.]{.underline} American thinkers developed elaborate
models and theories of deterrence. [US and NATO forces regularly carried
out exercises simulating the resort to nuclear weapons to make this
strategy credible.]{.underline}

[After the Cold War ended, the US and its allies had the luxury of
thinking less about nuclear deterrence and war-fighting.]{.underline}
Tensions with Russia receded and nuclear strategy came to seem like a
relic of a bygone era. [Yet today, [with Russia rising again as a
military threat, the]{.mark} grim [logic of **nuclear statecraft is
returning.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

The spike in tensions between Russia and the West over the past
half-decade has revealed a basic problem: [[NATO doesn't have the
capability to prevent Russia]{.mark}n forces [from]{.mark} quickly
[overrunning Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.]{.mark}]{.underline}
[Russian invaders would be at the gates of the Baltic capitals in two to
three days; existing NATO forces in the region would be destroyed or
swept aside. NATO could respond by mobilizing for a longer war to
liberate the Baltic countries, but this would require a bloody,
dangerous military campaign. Critically, that campaign would require
striking targets --- such as air defense systems --- located within
Russia itself, as well as suppressing Russian artillery, short-range
missiles and other capabilities within the Kaliningrad enclave, which is
situated behind NATO's front lines.]{.underline}

Moreover, this sort of NATO counteroffensive is precisely the situation
Russian nuclear doctrine seems meant to avert. [[Russian officials
understand that their country would lose a long war against
NATO]{.mark}.]{.underline} They are particularly alarmed at the
possibility of NATO using its unmatched military capabilities to conduct
conventional strikes within Russian borders. So [[the Kremlin has
signaled that it might carry out limited nuclear
strikes]{.underline}]{.mark} --- perhaps a "demonstration strike"
somewhere in the Atlantic, or against NATO forces in the theater ---
[[to force the alliance to make peace]{.mark} on Moscow's
terms.]{.underline} This concept is known as "escalate to de-escalate,"
and there is a growing body of evidence that the Russians are serious

## Cyber Attacks

#### Lithuania facing onslaught of intense Russian hacks

Theory at the London School of Economics, and has been awarded the Ben
Pimlott Prize for Political Writing by the Guardian and The Fabian
Society. Rowland is Technology correspondent, reporting on the many
areas tech is transforming lives. "Could the Russian cyber attack on
Lithuania draw a military response from NATO?",
https://news.sky.com/story/could-the-russian-cyber-attack-on-lithuania-draw-a-military-response-from-nato-12641986)LR

[**A NATO member is under attack.** The NATO member in question is the
Baltic state of **Lithuania**, which was **targeted on Monday by Russian
hackers.**]{.underline} According to the hackers, [the attack is still
going on. Transport and media websites have been hit, as have the
websites of various state institutions such as the Lithuanian tax
service, which had to pause its operations yesterday.]{.underline} A
Russian hacker group known as [Killnet claimed responsibility for the
attacks, claiming on its Telegram channel that the attack was
retaliation for Lithuania\'s decision to stop the transit of some goods
to the Russian territory of Kaliningrad on the Baltic
coast.]{.underline} The politics of this situation are extremely
complicated. Kaliningrad is Russian-owned, but it isn\'t connected to
the main body of Russia - it\'s a small piece of Russia surrounded by
NATO countries. [The Lithuanian government says it is simply enforcing
European Union sanctions on goods, but Russia has responded with
outrage, saying it is being stopped from accessing its sovereign
territory**. Russia promised to respond** in a way **that would \"have a
serious negative impact on the population of Lithuania\"**. Then, a
**few days later, came this cyber attack**]{.underline}. Does that mean
Russia attacked a NATO member? Not so fast. For a start, [the group that
claimed responsibility denies any connection to the Russian state,
saying it is \"not affiliated with any law enforcement authorities\".
The Russian government has long used third-party criminal groups to
conduct hacks and cyber attacks, so it would not come as a surprise if
it was involved.]{.underline} Nevertheless, on the surface at least, its
hands are clean. Then there\'s the nature of the attack. [Reports so far
suggest that it\'s a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack, a
crude attack which involves throwing huge amounts of traffic at a
website until it is forced offline.]{.underline} The attack has been
described as \"massive\", which is technically true, because in order to
work a DDoS attack has to be large, but that doesn\'t mean it will have
a massive effect. DDoS attacks are so common that most websites nowadays
have protection against them as standard. Even if an attack does work,
it won\'t steal any data. It\'s a blunt force instrument, little more.
Yet that does not mean we aren\'t moving towards that point, nor that a
cyber attack cannot lead us there. Another way in which cyber attacks
are different to physical attacks is that once they are started they can
spiral out of control. Unlike a bomb or a bullet, a virus can spread in
ways that even its makers don\'t intend. Almost exactly five years ago,
the costliest ever cyber attack was launched: a malware attack called
Not Petya. It is believed to have begun when Russian operatives infected
a small piece of Ukrainian accounting software, intending to disrupt
Ukrainian businesses. But from there it spread to companies around the
world, including shipping giant Maersk and food conglomerate Mondelez.
By the time it was done, Not Petya had caused \$10bn in estimated
damages.

Al Jazeera: **[Russia has said Lithuanian citizens will "feel the pain"

Russia could enact its own sanctions on the sale of goods to Lithuania.
The key Russian exports are oil and gas, and electricity, and Lithuania
has already made a decision much earlier before this conflict, that it
will not be purchasing any Russian energy sources. There could be a
question of fertilisers and other elements but there is already a broad
blanket of European sanctions against Russian goods. I view Russia's
statements more as threats and posturing for the Russian domestic
audience because a lot of \[Russian President Vladimir\] Putin's
statements tend to be aimed to show the resolve and the strength of the
Kremlin, rather than necessarily specifying any sort of actions they
would take or for the external audience. [What is concerning is that
**Russia used or the Kremlin use the terms that Lithuania has enacted a
blockade,** either the word choice is important, because blockade could
be **perceived as a military already action,** and therefore, **Russia
could try to**, you know, **justify some sort of \[military action\], as
well."**]{.underline} Al Jazeera: [How do you think the Kaliningrad
situation can impact the war in Ukraine?]{.underline} Grigas: I think
this situation in [Kaliningrad will show whether Russia is willing to
escalate further this conflict against the West, the European Union and
NATO.]{.underline} Al Jazeera: [The United States has said that it will
stand behind Lithuania and its NATO commitments to defend
it]{.underline} ... Grigas: NATO, the United States and European Union
countries have been very cautious not to get involved in this war.
[There's a **real fear of potential escalation** of conflict with Russia
directly **because one, Russia remains a nuclear state**.]{.underline}
[Second, because of the fact that it's controlled essentially by a
single man with a very small circle of advisers, who **has essentially a
free hand to take whatever decisions he may wish**.]{.underline} Al
Jazeera: Lithuania and Russia already had weak diplomatic relations, and
the war in Ukraine has worsened them. How will their ties be affected by
the ban? Grigas: Lithuania has been a very vocal supporter of Ukraine
since the very start of the war this February and, frankly, since
Russia's occupation of Crimea \[in 2014\] and the initial invasion of
the Donbas. Earlier this summer, Russia and Duma deputies were
discussing whether they should revoke Lithuania's independence that was
agreed to by the Soviet Union in 1991. This is part of kind of a broader
package of the Kremlin's threats on a smaller neighbouring country. I
don't think Lithuanian-Russian relations will improve in the near
future. Frankly, European and Russian relations will not improve in the
near future, nor will NATO and Russian relations, particularly as long
as the ongoing war in Ukraine continues.

[[Hybrid war]{.underline}]{.mark}fare [is]{.underline} roughly defined
as '[grey area' warfare]{.underline}, which often exists just beneath
the threshold of armed conflict. [It]{.underline} is designed to
[[erode]{.underline}]{.mark} public [[confidence in]{.underline}]{.mark}
civil [society and **[democratic foundations]{.mark}**, primarily
[through **cyber attacks on c**]{.mark}**ritical
[i]{.mark}nfrastructure**]{.underline}, including energy, or targeted
disinformation methods. In this regard, it poses a potential threat to
sovereignty, as it gives nations, terrorist organisations and criminal
actors relative anonymity via a low-cost, high-yield method to influence
the politics and policies of other states.

[[Russia is]{.mark} one of [the most active perpetrator]{.mark}s of
hybrid warfare]{.underline} and implemented it most effectively in its
2014 illegal annexation of Crimea. [[The Kremlin continues]{.mark} to
use it today]{.underline}, notably [in some countries [to]{.mark}
realise desired political outcomes such as undermining pro-Western
governments, **[divid]{.mark}ing and weakening [the NATO
Alliance]{.mark}**]{.underline}, or advancing its own economic
interests. [[China]{.underline}]{.mark} too [has recently [engaged in
cyber attacks]{.mark} and disinformation campaigns aimed at NATO Allies
[and poses a **grave risk to c**]{.mark}**ritical
[i]{.mark}nfrastructure**, including energy infrastructure]{.underline},
as highlighted in the recent NATO 2030 experts' report.

Ultimately, [**[hybrid war]{.mark}fare challenges to the energy sector
have the potential to [disrupt]{.mark} the [NATO]{.mark}'s political and
military effectiveness and [cohesion]{.mark}**. It will take time and
effort to counter these threats]{.underline}, if the Alliance is to
address dependencies among its members and act as a platform to build a
common picture of complex operational risk and vulnerabilities.

Energy sector increasingly targeted

The use of hybrid warfare is growing. [[The]{.mark} past [decade]{.mark}
has [seen a **dramatic increase** in hybrid threats]{.mark}
worldwide]{.underline}: from cyber attacks to disinformation campaigns
to covert military operations. [[Threats are]{.mark} becoming [more
frequent, complex, destructive and coercive]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
broader economic and security ramifications of hybrid warfare are
evident, especially when applied to the energy sector.

Russia has deployed a range of hybrid threats against the energy assets,
policies or supplies of NATO Allies, as well as other countries. It has
used political and economic leverage, combined with disinformation
campaigns, against Bulgaria and Romania to undermine efforts to reduce
their dependence on Russian energy sources. Supply disruptions have been
used in the past as well, most famously in the case of Ukraine in 2009,
the Baltic states before that and, more recently, against Bulgaria.

Russia has also used its economic clout, combined with political
influence, to advance its energy agenda, in Hungary, where the expansion
of the Paks Nuclear Power Plant is now underway using Russian energy
technology. Likewise, in Germany, Russia has used its commercial and
political ties, as well as other suspected malign influence, to advance
the controversial €12 billion Nord Stream II pipeline, now nearing
completion. Moreover, in 2020, a suspected Russian group, Berserk Bear
APT, launched cyber attacks against German energy companies, and has
been implicated in previous cyber attacks against German utilities in
2018.

[Russian-backed cyber attacks against energy]{.underline} assets [have
also been identified in a number of other Alliance members]{.underline},
including Poland, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States. In
some instances, [those cyber campaigns have run concurrent with other
hybrid threats against energy assets, like malign influence efforts and
**natural gas supply cutbacks**]{.underline}. Taken together, it is
clear that -- over the past decade and with increasing vigour --
**[[Russia has been pursuing a]{.mark} concerted hybrid [campaign aimed
at undermining the Alliance's energy security]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

Over the same period, among NATO's partner countries, **[Russia's hybrid
campaign has been most evident in Ukraine]{.underline}**, combining
supply disruptions, cyber attacks, economic and political influence, and
disinformation efforts to undermine the country's energy security and
sow political instability. The most disruptive effort was Russia's 2009
interruption of natural gas supplies, but the attacks have continued and
become increasingly complex and coercive.

A notable example is the December 2015 Black Energy cyber attack on the
western Ukrainian power station, which shut down power for nearly a
quarter million residents over a six hour period. This was followed, a
year later, with a more sophisticated attack on the power grid supplying
electricity to the capital, Kyiv, using CrashOverride/Industroyer
malware. While of shorter duration and scope than the previous attack,
the effort was far more sinister: it was aimed at compromising
electrical safety relays, which are used to protect bulk power
equipment. Had it not been detected by analysts, the final attack phase
could have led to physical destruction of expensive and
difficult-to-replace equipment beyond briefly disrupting power supplies.

Beyond the Euro-Atlantic area, [[Iran]{.mark} and other suspected states
[are]{.mark} currently [waging a c]{.mark}omplex hybrid [campaign
against **Saudi**]{.mark} **Arabia's [energy assets]{.mark}**[.
This]{.mark} campaign [may be illustrative of the future of hybrid
warfare]{.mark}, **particularly [in the domain of energy
security]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Through both covert and overt
military operations, and the use of proxy forces, Iran has repeatedly
disrupted or otherwise struck Saudi energy infrastructure.

The possible collusion of hostile actors in the ongoing Iranian campaign
against Saudi Arabia is of particular concern and may have consequences
for NATO Allies. Specifically, the 2017 cyber attack on the Petro Rabigh
complex, which resulted in a costly shutdown and forensic clean-up of
the facility and very nearly resulted in an uncontrolled gas release and
explosion. [Despite initial speculation that Iran was uniquely
responsible for the dangerous Triton malware used in the attack, the
United States has since concluded that the malware was developed by
Russia and imposed sanctions on the research institution connected with
its development.]{.underline} The malware has also been implicated in
attacks on energy companies in the United States.

[Other suspected measures in Iran's campaign include two drone strikes
by Iran's Houthi allies on Saudi refineries, covert attacks on two Saudi
registered oil tankers in the Persian Gulf and, most recently, attacks
on two foreign-flagged tankers at Saudi ports on the Red
Sea]{.underline}. Notably, the drone strike on the Saudi Aramco Abqaiq
refinery in late 2019, which was claimed by Houthi forces, provided Iran
with deniability and helped expose air defence weaknesses in Saudi
Arabia.

DOA: 7-20-2022 //ArchanSen\]

Should the acronym WMD, which stands for "Weapons of Mass Destruction,"
be updated to "Weapons of Mass Disruption?" I think it is a timely
question in this Digital Age as we connect and integrate billions of new
digital devices into our lives and business processes and when a
cyber-attack against one supply chain provider can lead to cascading
effects on entire communities across the globe. [[Cyberattacks
on]{.underline}]{.mark} Critical Infrastructure
([[CI]{.underline}]{.mark}) **[can [cause mass]{.mark} economic and
societal [impacts]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Fewer strategies]{.underline}
than cyber-attacks can [offer better plausible deniability and can cause
greater anxiety and instability to our society than targeting the
systems and networks that enable our day-to-day activitie]{.underline}s.
Consider that 20 years ago terrorists killed 3,000 Americans and
disrupted the entire U.S. and global economies with only four planes.
[[Given the growth]{.mark} and ubiquity [of tech]{.mark}nology today [we
must consider]{.mark} how **[the exponential growth of cyberattacks on
CI might]{.mark} be similarly leveraged by adversaries and criminal
actors [as]{.mark}**]{.underline} Weapons of Mass Disruption, the new
**[[WMD]{.underline}]{.mark}**.\[1\]

[Cyberattacks take many forms]{.underline}, often **[progressing through
multiple phases as they escalate in severity]{.underline}**. [Malicious
actors often initiate a network intrusion through phishing campaigns or
the purchase of compromised user credentials on the dark
web.]{.underline} What begins as the hijack of a single user profile
expands in severity. Intruders move laterally across internal systems,
conducting surveillance and gathering intelligence on network
environments before escalating to data theft, service disruptions, and
ransomware extortion.

The goals of these actors may be both strategic and economic in nature,
and targets may be government and/or the private sector. Cyberattacks
perpetrated on CI elements develop into the new WMD when the intended
and unintended consequences cause widespread damage and societal
impacts. [[A disruption of essential services, even if brief]{.mark},
**can [occupy significant]{.mark} civilian and [military
resources]{.mark}** in a region or entire country]{.underline}.\[2\]

Deterrence Options

Political science literature distinguishes between two basic ways to
deter an opponent.10 [[Deterrence through punishment]{.mark} threatens
to impose severe costs on an enemy]{.underline} if an attack occurs.
Punishment deters by the risk it places against high-value Russian
assets, but [it also]{.underline} **[[expands]{.mark} the
[conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [The Alliance may not choose to defend
its interests directly at the point of attack]{.underline}, where Russia
has chosen the time and ground of attack. Rather than accept battle
where it is least prepared or under the most adverse terrain, NATO may
strike at more vulnerable and valuable targets in order to threaten a
more opportune place, either a vulnerability or a gap in Russia's
defenses. Punishment is not necessarily connected to the direct defense
of the contested space but could include wider penalties---such as
nuclear escalation or expanding the geographic boundaries of the
conflict---that would raise the costs for an aggressor. Deterrence
through punishment is one option to influence the enemy's cost-benefit
analysis. On the other hand, denial-based deterrence seeks to deter an
aggressor by making the chance of a successful attack improbable,
cost-prohibitive, or untenable. [Deterrence through punishment is
**inherently offensive**, while denial-based deterrence is defensive in
nature]{.underline}.11

[Deterring Russian aggression in the Baltics short of military
hostilities]{.underline}, or "left of bang," [is a **political
problem**]{.underline} in which U.S. and NATO militaries are but one
component. Because of the presence of nuclear weapons on both sides, the
overriding consideration regarding [any confrontation between NATO and
Russia over the Baltics would require managing]{.underline} both
[vertical and horizontal escalation]{.underline}. The Alliance must
construct any deterrent strategy around that premise so that any actions
taken in the deterrence phase naturally mesh with a construct for
management of escalation up to and including armed conflict, should that
occur. A key concept of deliberate escalation is indicating to an enemy
that the costs will outweigh the potential benefits gained through
continued particular actions.

In the case of the Baltics, however, [punishment-based deterrence may
**lack credibility**]{.underline} [if Russia perceives that NATO lacks
the capability or resolve to carry out such a retaliatory
threat]{.underline}---[conventional or **nuclear**]{.underline}.
[Another weakness of punishment-based deterrence is the **asymmetry of
stakes**]{.underline} between parties. With the proximity of the Baltics
to its borders, Russia may be willing to bear greater costs and,
therefore, feel itself less vulnerable to threats of punishment if it
perceives Russian stakes are high and NATO's stakes are low.12 Finally,
as former As sistant Secretary of State Wess Mitchell observes, should
Russia gain the Baltic states through a fait accompli, "punishment
quickly morphs into compellence---not just dissuading an enemy but
dislodging him and forcing a withdrawal from his limited, stealthy
conquest."13 In order to deter an adversary, the Alliance needs to both
possess a capability and have the willingness to use it. Consequently,
at its logical extremes, punishment could entail the threat of a NATO
counterattack, possibly using ground forces staged in Poland via a push
through the Suwalki Gap, which would be time consuming to prepare,
militarily costly, and carry significant operational and escalatory
risks given the likelihood of extending the conflict to Belarus,
Kaliningrad, or even Russia proper. Such a scenario, a ground war in the
Baltics between NATO and Moscow, would play to Russian strengths and
represents a poor proposition for successful defense of the Baltic
states.14 Additionally, Russia's tactical nuclear doctrine of
"escalate-to-deescalate" further erodes deterrence by punishment,
assuming the United States and its Allies would be reluctant to use
nuclear weapons in kind, both out of an uncertainty about escalation
management and a modern-day aversion to high casualties.15

With the highest peak of only 318 m over sea level, [[the Baltic states
are **flat**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[The countries are **not situated**
in a **seismically active**]{.mark} [region]{.mark}, [neither are they
threatened by **tsunamis** or **tornados**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
However, there are still some natural hazards to critical infrastructure
and power supply, mostly caused by the cold or stormy Northern European
weather. While [[floods are usually **not
dangerous**]{.underline}]{.mark} and at some places even considered to
be a tourist attraction (Pamarys region  in Lithuania and Soomaa in
Estonia), the autumn and winter storms can be more dangerous, especially
in Estonia. [[While short term power cuts]{.underline}]{.mark} and the
inaccessibility of roads are usual and [[appear]{.underline}]{.mark}
every year with [both [the]{.mark} authorities and [population **well
prepared**]{.mark} for them]{.underline}, from time to time things get
more extreme. In December 2010, almost 600 people were stuck in their
cars in the snowstorm on Tallinn-- Narva road. One of the main roads of
the country was blocked for a day and it was a close call that nobody
froze to death. Rough weather in Southern Estonia in December 2019
disrupted the power supply of over 50  000 clients and took days to fix.
However, [although [events]{.mark} like these do happen in the Baltic
states, they **[do not have]{.mark}** disastrous [effects on
infrastructure]{.mark}]{.underline}.13

[[Would]{.mark} Vladimir [Putin send]{.mark} Russian [troops

[[There is **no room**]{.mark} [for
complacenc]{.mark}]{.underline}[y]{.mark}; [[until Russian tanks rolled
across **Ukraine**]{.mark}**'s** borders]{.underline} on February 24,
[[that too **seemed unthinkable**]{.underline}]{.mark}. EU and G7
summits in the past few days have committed to stepping up support to
Ukraine --- which on Monday suffered a horrific missile attack on a
shopping centre in Kremenchuk --- and to tightening sanctions that have
sapped Russia's economy and put [it]{.underline} on course for its first
debt default since 1998. Tuesday's Nato summit in Madrid [is a
**moment** for the [alliance]{.mark} to [demonstrate]{.mark} that
[it]{.mark} **[comprehends the magnitude]{.mark}** [of the
threat]{.mark} from the Kremlin]{.underline} --- [[and is
**ready**]{.mark} and **equipped** [to defend against any Russian
attempt to]{.mark} go beyond Ukraine and [attack Nato's]{.mark}
**[eastern flank]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

**[[Estonia]{.underline}]{.mark}**'s prime minister Kaja Kallas warned
last week her country [[would be]{.underline}]{.mark} "**[[wiped off the
map]{.underline}]{.mark}**" [[under existing Nato plans]{.mark} that
would allow the Baltic republics to be **overrun** in any Russian
invasion]{.underline}, before liberating them after 180 days. Even as
she spoke, [[Moscow was threatening]{.underline}]{.mark} "**[[serious
negative]{.underline}]{.mark}**" [[consequences to]{.mark} nearby
**[Lithuania]{.mark}** [after it]{.mark} barred rail [transfer
of]{.mark} some [goods]{.mark} to]{.underline} the Russian exclave of
[Kaliningrad]{.underline} --- though Vilnius said it was merely applying
EU sanctions.

Brussels has attempted to calm the tensions. But [[the incident
underlined the]{.mark} **[sensitivity]{.mark}** [of the]{.mark} three
[Baltic]{.mark} states]{.underline}, occupied by the Soviet Union for
half a century --- [[and]{.mark} of [the]{.mark} **[Suwałki
Gap]{.mark}**]{.underline}, the Polish-Lithuanian border strip between
Kaliningrad and Belarus, [[which]{.mark}, if seized by Russia, [could
**cut off**]{.mark} the [Baltics from Nato]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[Plans]{.underline}]{.mark} to be endorsed by Nato [[in Madrid
go]{.mark} **[less far]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[than]{.mark} Kallas
[would have liked]{.mark}]{.underline}. They are pivotal nonetheless.
The alliance is rightly moving from a "tripwire" concept, under which
Nato stationed about 1,000 foreign troops in each country to deter
invasion, to a focus on a full and rapid defence of allied territory.
[[Nato will put]{.mark} **[several thousand]{.mark}** [troops in each
Baltic state]{.mark}]{.underline}, and expand its rapid reaction force
from 40,000 to 300,000, ready to start deploying to specific eastern
locations --- [where they will have **trained** and **completed
exercises**]{.underline} --- within hours of an attack. [[More]{.mark}
**heavy [weapons]{.mark}**, **logistics** and **command-and-control**
assets [will be **pre-positioned**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

This is in part a reversion to the Cold War-era model, when Nato's top
commander knew exactly which forces were on standby, where, and how
quickly they could move. [[Yet many lessons on **deterrence**]{.mark},
defence [and]{.mark} **[signalling]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[have been
**forgotten**]{.mark} in the three decades since]{.underline}, [and must
be **relearnt**]{.underline}.

[[It is **vital**]{.underline}]{.mark}, too, [[to put in place the
**monitoring**]{.mark}, **decision-making** [and]{.mark}
**[logistics]{.mark}** [needed to enable forces]{.mark} to be **swiftly
deployed**]{.underline}. So is the funding to ensure adequate levels of
readiness are constantly maintained. Nine Nato states now meet the
target of spending 2 per cent of economic output on defence; 19 more
have "clear plans" to do so by 2024. Yet [[Western allies have
made]{.mark} **[too many declarations]{.mark}**]{.underline} since
Russia seized Crimea and parts of east Ukraine in 2014,
[[without]{.mark} **[proper implementation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[The
priority is to]{.mark} **[convince Putin]{.mark}**]{.underline} ---
[[who]{.underline}]{.mark} some officials fear [[does not think Nato's

[[that the alliance's]{.mark} security [guarantees]{.mark} **[apply

With Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine, now is a good time to take note of
a little-spoken-of, but glaring, imbalance between America's and
Russia's nuclear arsenals---and how it could affect stability in Europe
and the interests of the United States and those of its European allies
and partners.

If asked, many Americans and Europeans probably believe that the United
States and Russia are pretty evenly matched in terms of the number of
nuclear weapons both sides have in their arsenals. While their beliefs
are entirely understandable, they are not completely correct

Under the 2010 bilateral New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty---also
known as New START---the United States and Russia have a similar number
of deployed strategic (i.e., high-yield and long-range) nuclear weapons:
1,550 deployed nuclear warheads each.1 But not all of Washington's or
Moscow's nuclear weapons are covered by New START.

Indeed, [[Russia has]{.mark} nearly a [**10:1** advantage over the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and NATO in]{.mark}
non-strategic]{.underline} (i.e., [low-yield and
short-range]{.underline}) [nuclear weapons]{.underline}
(**[[NSNWs]{.underline}]{.mark}**).2

Assessments based on open sources estimate that [Russia has about
**2,000** NSNWs]{.underline}. It is similarly assessed that [the United
States and NATO have about **200**]{.underline} NSNWs in their arsenal.3
It is postulated that half of those U.S.-NATO weapons are located in the
United States and half are based in Europe as part of NATO's nuclear
forces.4

[While capable of significant destruction,]{.underline} [these
**[t]{.mark}**actical **[n]{.mark}**uclear **[w]{.mark}**eapon[s]{.mark}
are lower in yield]{.underline} -- or explosive power -- [and [are meant
for use]{.mark} on the battlefield [against military
installations]{.mark} or troop and equipment concentrations]{.underline}
as opposed for use against counterforce or countervalue targets such as
ICBM missile fields, command and control nodes, and or population
centers (e.g., cities).

It is believed that [Russia can deploy these weapons on multiple
tactical systems including dual-capable short-range or theater ballistic
missiles, torpedoes, and anti-ship missiles]{.underline}.5 Indeed, it is
expected that [Russia's new **hypersonic** weapons may be
dual-capable]{.underline} (i.e., conventional or nuclear armed) [as
well]{.underline}.6

Major nuclear weapons states, including Russia, have said that a nuclear
war could never be won and therefore should never be fought. However,
there are deep concerns among policy makers and security analysts
outside Russia about whether Moscow fully embraces that idea or if it is
just convenient diplomatic rhetoric.

Also [[of increasing concern is]{.mark} a Russian **military doctrine**
associated with battlefield nuclear weapons known as]{.underline}
"**[[escalate to deescalate]{.underline}]{.mark}**." This topic is of
particularly interest right now with the war in Ukraine ongoing since
late February 2022. According to the 2018 U.S. Nuclear Posture Review
(NPR):

"Russia considers the United States and the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) to be the principal threats to its contemporary
geopolitical ambitions. [[Russian]{.mark} strategy and [doctrine
emphasize the]{.mark}]{.underline} potential [**[coercive]{.mark}** and
**military** [uses of nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[It]{.underline}]{.mark} mistakenly [[assesses]{.mark}
that]{.underline} the threat of nuclear escalation or actual [**[first
use]{.mark}** of nuclear weapons [would]{.mark} serve to
"[de-escalate]{.mark}" [a conflict]{.mark} on terms favorable to
Russia]{.underline}. [[These]{.underline}]{.mark} mistaken [perceptions
[increase]{.mark} the prospect for **dangerous
[miscalc]{.mark}ulation**]{.underline} [[and]{.mark}
**[escalation]{.mark}**]{.underline}."7

The NPR further asserts that:

"Moscow threatens and exercises limited nuclear first use, suggesting a
mistaken expectation that coercive nuclear threats or limited first use
could paralyze the United States and NATO and thereby end a conflict on
terms favorable to Russia. Some in the United States refer to this as
Russia's "escalate to de-escalate" doctrine. "Deescalation" in this
sense follows from Moscow's mistaken assumption of Western capitulation
on terms favorable to Moscow."8

Though the Russians seemingly refute the existence of this doctrine by
its American name at least, some sources assert that the policy may
actually have been developed in the late 1990s, when now-Russian
President Vladimir Putin was chairman of the Russian National Security
Council under President Boris Yeltsin.9

The idea behind escalate to deescalate is that [[Russia might
employ]{.mark} one **[t]{.mark}**actical **[n]{.mark}**uclear
**[w]{.mark}**eapon]{.underline} (or more) [[during a conventional
conflict with NATO]{.mark} forces [for]{.mark} the purposes of
[preventing a defeat]{.mark},]{.underline} [[consolidating]{.mark}
territorial [gains]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[or]{.mark} even [freezing a
conflict]{.mark}]{.underline} in place without the prospect of further
fighting.

Indeed, because of the large, nearly 10:1 disparity between the number
of Russian and U.S. tactical nuclear weapons, Moscow may think a nuclear
response from NATO is not a credible threat due to Russia's asymmetric
advantage. Other factors may also play a role in Russian calculations,
including a perception that NATO's large membership would have
difficulty finding a political-military consensus on an appropriate
response, including a nuclear option.

An example of the potential use of this Russian nuclear doctrine in a
hypothetical scenario might be helpful here:

[[Moscow attacks]{.underline}]{.mark} one---or all---of [[the
**Baltic**]{.mark} **States** with its conventional forces to establish
control over some]{.underline}, or all, [of these nations'
territory]{.underline}, returning them to Russia's control as they were
in the Soviet era. [[Invoking A]{.mark}rticle [V]{.mark}, [NATO
responds]{.mark} with conventional forces]{.underline} to protect and
restore the sovereignty of these three allied states.

Concerned about the inferiority of its conventional forces in this fight
against the allied powers, [[Moscow then contemplates exploding
a]{.mark} low-yield **[t]{.mark}**actical **[n]{.mark}**uclear
**[w]{.mark}**eapon somewhere in theater [as a
warning]{.mark}]{.underline} of Russia's potential escalation from the
conventional to the nuclear domain of warfare, including the potential
future use of high-yield, strategic nuclear weapons.

In Moscow's eyes, perhaps NATO will become concerned about the possible
escalation of the fighting from the conventional to the
nuclear---especially Russia's potential use of more powerful nuclear
weapons against European and American cities. In response, NATO may
consider pausing its counteroffensive against Russian forces in the
Baltics.

Indeed, [Moscow may **misperceive**]{.underline} [that]{.underline} if
[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} [does not have sufficient tactical nuclear
weapon capabilities to respond in kind]{.underline}, it would be
inclined to seek de-escalation rather than launch a strategic nuclear
weapon at Russia and risk moving further up the escalation ladder---a
[[response]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[could lead to]{.mark} **[all-out
nuclear war]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Using its tactical nuclear weapon advantage over NATO and having
strategic nuclear parity with Washington, Moscow could threaten
additional low-yield nuclear strikes unless fighting ends on Russia's
terms. Ideally for Moscow, NATO might decide that there is no good
option available to respond and chooses to cease hostilities, locking in
Moscow's ill-gotten gains [[in the Baltics]{.underline}]{.mark}.

With these political-military calculations in mind, Russia takes a
chance on the expected NATO response and explodes a 10-kiloton tactical
nuclear weapon near or in the European theater. As a result, nuclear
deterrence fails for the first time in history not due to the use of
strategic nuclear weapons that so many people are aware of, but the
imbalance of battlefield nuclear weapons between NATO and Russia.

SUMMARY

AMID THE ROLLOUT of the February 2018 U.S. Nuclear Posture Review,
security analysts have understandably focused much attention on its
implications for the U.S. nuclear arsenal, intra-alliance ties with key
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) partners, and Washington's icy
relations with Moscow. But [nuclear deterrence]{.underline} [only
partially addresses NATO members' shared concerns about Russian
behavior, especially in light of Moscow's growing propensity to
undermine the alliance with **nonkinetic operations**]{.underline} and
other tactics [that nuclear warheads cannot easily deter]{.underline}.

[The risk of escalation sparking a wider
conflict]{.underline}---[deliberately, **inadvertently**, or
**accidentally**]{.underline}---[between Russia and NATO is
**dangerously high**]{.underline}. [This is particularly the case in the
Baltics, a region that would be difficult for NATO to defend because the
military balance there very much favors Russia]{.underline}; moreover,
[Moscow could instigate unrest among the Russian minorities living
there]{.underline}. [To mitigate these risks and remain united, NATO
members must complement deterrence with **resilience** and
risk-reduction]{.underline} measures better [tailored to addressing
Russian behavior below the threshold of outright conventional and
nuclear conflict]{.underline}.

THE CHALLENGE RUSSIA POSES

To keep the West out of the non-NATO former Soviet republics, [Moscow
has developed new-generation warfare, a coercive strategy that combines
traditional conventional and nuclear military capabilities with
nonkinetic operations such as cyberattacks, propaganda, and
disinformation]{.underline}.

NATO members have different views of Russia's intentions toward the
alliance and how to respond. In the wake of the Ukraine crisis, some
allies fear that Moscow could use military force against NATO,
particularly the Baltic states. They urge the alliance to do more,
militarily, to deter Russia and to reassure its easternmost members.
They fear that NATO's current response---including, most importantly,
the deployment of a trip wire force of four multinational battalions,
the Enhanced Forward Presence (EFP), to the three Baltic states and
Poland---might not be enough to deter deliberate Russian escalation.
Others are rather skeptical that Moscow presents an immediate military
threat and caution against unnecessarily raising tensions further.
Instead of deploying additional forces, they want NATO to focus on
increasing the resilience of member states against Russian nonkinetic
operations and to engage in a serious security dialogue with Russia,
reducing the risks of inadvertent and accidental escalation.

Both approaches could create the risk of miscalculation and, perhaps,
escalation. If NATO underestimates the threat Russia poses, the alliance
may give Moscow reason to test its resolve---perhaps even by using
military force. Conversely, if NATO overestimates the threat emanating
from Russia, its well-intentioned defensive measures may lead to a
security dilemma that precipitates an arms race and ultimately
undermines alliance unity.

ESCALATION RISKS IN THE BALTICS

The challenge Russia poses, combined with NATO's responses to date,
creates a series of potential escalation pathways, which need allies'
urgent attention.

The Pitfalls of NATO's Trip Wire Approach

The alliance's need to reinforce troops in a crisis and the positioning
of some of its forces in the region could spark inadvertent or
deliberate escalation.

• Were Russia to threaten military escalation in a crisis, NATO would
feel significant pressure to reinforce forward-deployed troops as a
defensive precaution. However, if NATO failed to clearly and
persuasively communicate to Russia its defensive intent, Moscow might
misread the deployment as the opening of a NATO offensive, perhaps
responding by escalating to (what the Kremlin would see as) the
preventive use of military force.

• As soon as NATO was to send in reinforcements (or even, perhaps, when
Moscow was to judge the alliance was about to do so), Russia might try
to use its anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) capabilities around the
Baltic Sea to cut off sea and air routes. NATO might, therefore, believe
it has little choice other than to attack Russian A2/AD capabilities
early in a conflict, effectively escalating conflict into Russian
territory.

• Even more concerning, were Russia to use force against the alliance by
taking a small portion of land in, for instance, eastern Latvia, EFP
forces, which are based far from the Russian border, might arrive too
late to engage in combat (especially given that NATO's decisionmaking
process could be quite slow). Consequently, Russia might hope to get
away with a military fait accompli.

• NATO's combined conventional military power and any subsequent efforts
to retake the Baltics through massive force deployments, once initiated,
would put the onus on Moscow. Out of fear of losing a conventional
conflict with NATO, Russia might escalate further, perhaps even to
nuclear use.

Ambiguous Nuclear Doctrines Ambiguities in NATO's and Russia's nuclear
policies create the potential for deliberate escalation. • NATO allies
have disagreed about the politics of nuclear sharing, the idea of having
nonnuclear NATO members take part in nuclear planning and some members
providing national aircraft to deliver U.S. nuclear weapons in the event
of their use. In addition, allies disagree about the appropriate
readiness levels for those dual-capable aircraft in Europe and about
whether NATO exercises should involve nuclear elements. This somewhat
ambiguous stance toward nuclear deterrence might lead Russia (perhaps
wrongly) to doubt NATO's resolve in a crisis, increasing the risk of
escalation. • Conversely, NATO might not view Russian nuclear threats as
credible, especially early in a crisis when they might appear to be
disproportionate. In this case, NATO misreading Russian resolve might
cause escalation.

Nonkinetic Operations

Moscow's efforts to influence Russian minorities in the three Baltic
states could lead to a crisis in which neither NATO nor Russia would be
able to manage subsequent escalation.

• For many years, Russia has staged a subversive disinformation campaign
in the Baltics, aimed at influencing Russian minorities. If protests by
these minorities were to occur---whether deliberately fomented by Moscow
or not---NATO and Russia might find it difficult to deescalate the
initial stages of a crisis and instead might get drawn into an
action-reaction cycle, even though neither side would want it to spiral
out of control.

• In such a scenario, given the possibility of Russia's building up
forces in proximity to Baltic borders, it is not clear what role NATO
forces, particularly the EFP, could or should play. NATO would have to
balance the risks of escalating early against waiting too long, and the
alliance might find it challenging to identify when a crisis would
warrant a military response and what that response might be.

Dangerous Military Incidents

Russia's continued military brinkmanship (by its aircraft, in
particular) coupled with inadequate crisis communication tools could
trigger accidental escalation.

• An accidental military incident---such as a Russian fighter jet
accidentally crashing into a U.S. destroyer in the Baltic Sea---could
escalate rapidly. European NATO members might prefer to deal with such
an incident as an alliance, whereas Washington would probably prefer not
to. As a result, NATO might not only be weakened by infighting but the
U.S.-Russian action-reaction cycle might unfold more rapidly than
multilateral efforts to clarify what occurred and to deescalate the
crisis. In addition, existing crisis communication channels with Russia
might not be used to prevent escalation in the wake of such an accident.

On Monday, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg announced plans to
put 300,000 troops at high readiness as part of the "biggest overhaul of
our collective defense and deterrence since the Cold War."

By Wednesday, as NATO leaders gathered at a summit in Madrid,
[[the]{.mark} vast new [mobilization appeared]{.mark} to be [more
fearsome on paper than **in reality**]{.mark}, more of an **aspiration**
than a dramatic new commitment]{.underline} to defend Europe.

[[Stoltenberg's announcement caught]{.underline}]{.mark} the [top
defense [officials]{.mark}]{.underline} of many NATO members **[[off
guard]{.underline}]{.mark}**, leading them to question which of their
forces, if any, were being included in the 300,000 figure.

"Maybe [[it's]{.mark} **[number magic]{.mark}**]{.underline}?" said one
senior European defense official, who, like others, spoke on the
condition of anonymity to talk frankly about the confusion.

Several senior European security policymakers said they were taken by
surprise, with no advance notice of the plan to expand NATO's
quick-response force from its current size of 40,000 in light of the
Ukraine war and Russia's ongoing military threats to
[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} territory.

A senior defense official from a different alliance country said its
leaders [[had]{.mark} **[not been consulted]{.mark}**]{.underline} about
the figure ahead of time. The official wondered which of his nation's
troops were being counted toward the force --- and whether it included
personnel from a volunteer national guard who have civilian day jobs.

Asked at a news conference on Wednesday about the mystery [of the
missing troops]{.underline}, [Stoltenberg said [the]{.mark}]{.underline}
"**[[majority]{.underline}]{.mark}**" [[will be based in]{.mark}side
[their home countries]{.mark}]{.underline} and will build on existing
personnel --- **[[code]{.underline}]{.mark}**, in some ways,
[[for]{.mark} **[simply reclassifying]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[troops
that currently exist]{.underline}]{.mark} and making them more available
for fast deployment under NATO command in the event of a security
crisis.

"Of course it requires, as always when you do something in NATO, that
allies contribute the forces they have promised to contribute," he said,
not directly addressing why some countries apparently have not yet been
asked about stepping up.

Stoltenberg said he hopes to have the expanded rapid force available
sometime next year.

A NATO official, speaking on the condition of anonymity per the
alliance's ground rules, said that country-specific numbers still needed
pinning down. [Even the 300,000 total is **theoretical**]{.underline}
for the moment: "[[The concept has not been]{.underline}]{.mark} fully
[[worked up]{.underline}]{.mark} yet," the official said. "We will have
to do more to build up the model before we can work out what national
commitments can be."

interconnections belonging to the [European network]{.underline} the
region [plays an important role]{.underline} in gas and petroleum
transit, ensuring the uninterrupted flow of energy to further European
destinations. Consequently, the Kremlin started to look around for
solutions and has developed a strategy comprising the construction of
alternative routes, namely the Nord Stream 1 and 2, the Turkish Stream
and the Power of Siberia pipelines.

However, the [complex situation must be framed inside a broader
strategic vision]{.underline} according to Keohane's and Nye's
interdependence theory. [Russian weight]{.underline} in the Baltic
energy security [undergoes military security conditions]{.underline}.
The Baltic States are part [of the eastern flank of NATO]{.underline},
therefore their integration into the Russian energy infrastructure is
meant to [balance the presence of the Western military
alliance]{.underline} in the region\[47\]. Moreover, the Baltics
register a high presence of Russian immigrants in their populations,
thus energy is used as a weapon to prevent any kind of discrimination.

The request of the Estonian Defence minister for a [strengthening of
NATO's presence in the Baltics]{.underline} following the outbreak of
the Russian-Ukrainian conflict in 2022 **[reflects well the
interdependence hypothesis]{.underline}**. Estonia, likewise, its
neighbours, fears the extension of the conflict to the area and the
possibility of retaliation in the energy sector, as the country has
engaged itself actively in the reception of war refugees from
Ukraine\[48\]. According to the Bank of Estonia, the [outbreak of war
has influenced markets, prices of natural gas and electricity are
increasing]{.underline}, and households' consumption is expected to
reduce in the short term. Therefore, the Estonian government decided to
place natural gas and heating under a price ceiling until spring
2022\[49\]. Lithuania on its side is bringing forward the GIPL project
with Poland and is looking forward to opening the pipeline ahead of
schedule, on May 1st. The three **[countries foresee closer regional and
European cooperation to reduce their dependence.]{.underline}**

In [the past, Russia could benefit from the European
uncertainty]{.underline} due to the different levels of European
involvement in the matter and the controversy in the support of stronger
sanctions. But a [comprehensive energy network has been
developed]{.underline} in the past twenty years and now the European
Union presents itself as a single and active actor in the international
environment, that stands for the democratic values and is ready to
defend itself against external claims of special interest zones in the
former Soviet space\[50\]. For the Baltic States, this means knowing
that they can fully lean on Western support in asserting their own
sovereignty.

Therefore, to reinforce its self-determination, the European Union
launched the REPower plan in March 2022, aiming at **[phasing out the
fossil fuels import dependence from Russia]{.underline}**. The strategy
requires the almost complete filling up of the capacity gas stock
storage before winter, the replacement of gas in heating and power
generation and more renewables investments\[51\].

#### Baltic renewables k2 european green energy transition

Lukas **Trakimavičius**, 3-19-2021, Trakimavičius works at the Research
and Lessons Learned Division of the NATO Energy Security Centre of
Excellence \"The untapped green energy potential of the Baltic States,\"
euractiv,
https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy/opinion/the-untapped-green-energy-potential-of-the-baltic-states//DG

As the [global energy transition gathers speed]{.underline}, the
[Baltics may not seem like its obvious frontrunners]{.underline}.
Despite making great strides in making their energy systems cleaner,
**[fossil fuels still remain a staple]{.underline}** of their energy
diet. However, growing evidence suggests that the Baltics have a
**[massive offshore wind energy potential]{.underline}**, which could
have a **[game-changing effect]{.underline}** for the entire region.
Chances are, wind turbines could not only propel the Baltics to the
forefront of the energy transition, but also to the ranks of clean
energy exporters. As things stand, few would argue that the [Baltics are
on the cutting edge of the clean energy transition]{.underline}. Like
most of their European peers, they get the bulk of their energy from
fossil fuels such as oil and natural gas. These are either imported from
far abroad or, as is the case with Estonian oil shale, mined from deep
underground. Meanwhile, renewables such as onshore wind, solar or
hydropower still account for a tiny fraction of their overall energy
needs. In 2019, these energy sources met some 2.6 percent
of [Lithuania](https://www.iea.org/countries/lithuania)'s, 4.6 percent
of [Latvia](https://www.iea.org/countries/latvia)'s and 1.3 percent
of [Estonia](https://www.iea.org/countries/estonia)'s total primary
energy demand. Granted, the overall share of renewables is vastly
greater once biomass is added into the mix. Yet, some
scientists [argue](https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/publication/eur-scientific-and-technical-research-reports/use-woody-biomass-energy-production-eu) that
fuels such as firewood or wood pellets may not be the most
environmentally sustainable sources of energy. However, **[what the
Baltics lack in fossil fuels, they make up for with an abundance of
wind]{.underline}** in the Baltic Sea, which can be harnessed and
converted into electricity. Though [currently none of the Baltics have
any windmills]{.underline} in the open seas, all three have major
offshore wind plans for the future. Lithuania, for example, intends
to [have](https://enmin.lrv.lt/en/news/offshore-wind-another-direction-of-renewable-energy-to-strengthen-local-power-generation-in-lithuania) at
least 700 megawatt (MW) of offshore wind farms in operation by 2030.
Latvia and Estonia are also eying to co-develop
a [joint](https://www.windpowermonthly.com/article/1690879/estonia-latvia-sign-pact-1gw-offshore-wind-farm) 1,000
MW wind farm in the Gulf of Riga. On top of that,
Estonia [wants](https://news.err.ee/1149566/dutch-company-van-oord-buys-stake-in-saare-wind-energy) to
have a 1,000 MW offshore wind park near the island of Saarema by 2028,
in addition to a slew of other projects that are
under [consideration](https://www.windpowermonthly.com/article/1690879/estonia-latvia-sign-pact-1gw-offshore-wind-farm).All
of this sounds great, but it could just be the beginning. According to a
recent
WindEurope [study](https://windeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/files/about-wind/reports/WindEurope-Our-Energy-Our-Future.pdf),
the B[altic Sea could be the next big thing for Europe's energy
transition]{.underline}. It is estimated that
Lithuania [could](https://windeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/files/about-wind/reports/WindEurope-Our-Energy-Our-Future.pdf) have
up to 3,600 MW, Latvia up to 2,900 MW and Estonia up to 1,500 MW of
offshore windfarms by 2050. If this generation capacity could be met,
the study claims that the Baltics could
potentially [export](https://windeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/files/about-wind/reports/WindEurope-Our-Energy-Our-Future.pdf) around
half of their offshore wind electricity to neighboring states.
Obviously, it is difficult to say with certainty just how much
electricity would the [Baltics be able to export]{.underline} and others
would like to import. After all, to get to a zero-carbon future, the
Baltics and their **[neighbors will have
to [undergo](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/04/can-electricity-decarbonize-the-energy-sector/) tremendous
changes by 2050]{.underline}**. Not only will they have to **[make
energy use more efficient]{.underline}**, but they will also have to
d[ecarbonize and electrify large portions of their
economies]{.underline}. Still, if the Baltics would harness their full
offshore wind potential and would continue to develop other renewable
sources of energy, there are few doubts that a good chunk of their
electricity might still be available for export. To get more bang for
the buck, the Baltics could also take some of this newfound electricity
and transform it into green hydrogen using a process known as
electrolysis. Green hydrogen could be u[sed for manufacturing,
transport, heating
or [converted](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/solar-and-wind-power-could-ignite-a-hydrogen-energy-comeback/) back
into electricity to back up the grid]{.underline}. Or it could simply be
exported to neighbouring states. This step would [prevent excess
electricity from being wasted and also help decarbonise]{.underline}
those sectors of the economy where electrification is difficult.

#### European transition checks warming\-\--else, all other renewables fail

**EEA,** European Environment Agency 8-1-**2017**, \"Energy and climate
change,\" European Environment Agency,
https://www.eea.europa.eu/signals/signals-2017/articles/energy-and-climate-change//DG

The global [climate is changing]{.underline} and that is [posing
increasingly severe risks for ecosystems, human health and the
economy]{.underline}. The EEA's recent assessment '[Climate change,
impacts and vulnerability in Europe
2016](http://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/climate-change-impacts-and-vulnerability-2016)' shows
that Europe's regions, too, are already facing [impacts of a changing
climate, including rising sea levels, more extreme weather, flooding,
droughts and storms]{.underline}.

These changes are happening because large amounts of [greenhouse gases
are released]{.underline} into the atmosphere [as a result
of]{.underline} many human activities worldwide, including, [most
importantly, burning fossil fuels for electricity
generation]{.underline}, heating and transport. Combustion of fossil
fuels also releases air pollutants that harm the environment and human
health.

Globally, the use of **[energy represents by far the largest source of
greenhouse gas emissions]{.underline}** from human activities.
About [two thirds of global greenhouse gas
emissions](http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/CO2EmissionsfromFuelCombustion_Highlights_2016.pdf) are
linked to burning fossil fuels for energy to be used for heating,
electricity, transport and industry. In Europe, too, the energy
processes are the largest emitter of greenhouse gases, being responsible
for 78 % of total EU emissions in 2015.

Our use and production of energy have a massive impact on the climate
and the converse is also increasingly true. **[Climate change can alter
our energy generation potential]{.underline}** and energy needs. For
example, [changes to the water cycle have an impact on hydropower, and
warmer temperatures increase the energy demand for cooling]{.underline}
in the summer, while decreasing the demand for heating in the winter.

Global efforts so far to mitigate climate change culminated in
the [[Paris
Agreement]{.underline}](http://unfccc.int/paris_agreement/items/9485.php) in
2015. Through the agreement, 195 countries adopted the first-ever
universal and legally binding, global climate deal. The target of the
agreement --- limiting the global average temperature rise to well below
2 °C, while aiming to limit the increase to 1.5 °C --- is ambitious and
**[cannot be achieved without a major overhaul of global energy
production]{.underline}** and consumption. 

To support the global climate agenda, the [EU has adopted]{.underline}
binding climate and energy targets for 2020 and [proposed targets for
2030]{.underline} as part of its overall efforts to move to a low-carbon
economy and to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 80-95 % by 2050. The
first set of climate and energy targets for 2020 includes a 20 % cut in
greenhouse gas emissions (compared with 1990 levels), 20 % of energy
consumption coming from renewables and a 20 % improvement in energy
efficiency. Based on the current proposals in discussion in EU
institutions, the next milestone of 2030 pushes these targets to a 40 %
cut in emissions, [27 % of energy coming from renewable
sources]{.underline} and a 27 % improvement in energy efficiency (or
30 %, as recently proposed by the European Commission) compared with
baseline.

The year 2022 brings the globe into a period of what could be described
with the oxymoron "stable uncertainty". Societies around the world are
adapting to living their lives and making decisions against the backdrop
of the everdeveloping COVID-19 pandemic, and the constant lingering
feeling of not knowing what tomorrow holds is neither new nor shocking
anymore. The conundrum of "stable uncertainty", however, exacerbates and
facilitates other diverse challenges, to which we commonly refer as
hybrid threats.

[[The Baltics **as well as** Taiwan have been facing]{.mark}
**[uncertainties]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[caused by risks to **political
legitimacy**]{.mark}, **societal [resilience]{.mark}**, **critical
infrastructure**, **energy security**, [and]{.mark} **[cyber
security]{.mark}**]{.underline} long before the world went into lockdown
-- and long enough to have developed a certain resilience. It is a
resilience that stems from unique, but translatable experiences of
small, yet resourceful democracies. [The **goal**]{.underline}
[of]{.underline} the Latvian Institute of International Affairs
publication "Commonalities, risks, and lessons for small democracies:
[[hybrid threats in Baltics and Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark}" [is to
**take stock** of these experiences and their regional
manifestations]{.underline}, [to]{.underline} **[[draw
parallels]{.underline}]{.mark}** between the threats that caused them,
to map the risks we're still facing, [[and]{.mark} to [present]{.mark}
**[wider lessons]{.mark}** [based]{.mark}]{.underline} both [[on the
**successes**]{.mark} and **tribulations** [of the Baltic
states]{.mark}]{.underline} and Taiwan. The volume is designed to
provide an overview of how the Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia and
Estonia on one side and Taiwan on the other face, combat and
conceptualize hybrid threats.

#### 5G cyber is the new battlefield, mutual cooperation between US-NATO with the Baltics key to combat China and Russia

[In light of power competition vis-à-vis cooperation with the US,
NATO,]{.underline} and the EU, [and small states standing up to larger
powers with **nefarious intentions,**]{.underline} the drawback is that
no entity is capable of defeating all cyberattacks; rather, in order to
succeed in cyberspace**[, the key is learning how to adequately
*[cope.]{.mark}*]{.underline}**24 [When it comes to information warfare,
and one of the reasons for which it is so dangerous, is that the
antagonist need not win -- they succeed if they are able to successfully
cloud the issue.]{.underline}25 [It is no secret that **Russia has
waged** **numerous information warfare campaigns in the Baltics** and
show **no sign of giving up.** **Recommendations and policy
developments**]{.underline} Keep on the cusp of cyber hygiene and widely
promote amongst citizens: General H.R. McMaster notes [the importance of
American efforts to conduct reconnaissance in cyberspace and preempt
attacks]{.underline}.26 S[trive to continuously be one step ahead of
hackers. Although this is a daunting, if not (nearly) impossible task,
it is one which would involve both governments and the general
public.]{.underline} One aspect which has greatly contributed to [the
success of Estonia in becoming a world leader in cyber defence is
investing in people.]{.underline}27 Promoting cyber hygiene is one
aspect at which Estonia excels. Raising further awareness about media
literacy to combat disinformation and misinformation also helps to win
the battle against information warfare. [McMaster also **advocates for
the US to learn from countries** which were on the receiving end of
Russian aggression]{.underline}.28 As one of the strengths which Estonia
possesses is its investment in people, Estonia is a success story in
cyber and IT education and training, ranging from kindergarteners to the
elderly.29 [In an increasingly multipolar world order**, the rise of
China presents a serious security challenge** to Europe and the
Transatlantic alliance and can be seen on a number of
fronts.]{.underline} [One of the most pressing, especially when it comes
to cybersecurity, is 5G. If seen through the lens of 'the West', then a
united front should consist of the US and NATO, plus PfP
countries,]{.underline} along with the EU in cyber policy. [When it
comes to 5G, this is especially important. The Baltic states have taken
strides to become leaders in 5G policy and can use this opportunity to
take a leading role in a Western front in the battlegrounds for 5G
policy]{.underline}. [Keeping focus on **both China and Russia as
threats to the security of NATO**]{.underline} and the EU: For valid
reasons -- both historical and contemporary -- the Russian Federation is
identified as the primary security threat to the 3 Baltic states. The
most contemporary events in the neighborhood do not indicate any change
in the consistency or persistence of the threat, nor its digital nature.
[Cyber and hybrid threats directed towards the Baltic states from the
Russian Federation will not cease and military, government, and civilian
entities need to continue with vigilance, adapt to the rapidly changing
nature of cybersecurity and cyberwar, as well as anticipate future
changes, staying ahead of the curve.]{.underline} However, despite the
very valid concerns over Russian cyber activity, the [Baltic states
should not neglect such concerns as they relate to China. Indeed, as
aforementioned, the Baltic states, especially Lithuania, have taken a
firm stance towards China,]{.underline} [in cyberspace and
beyond,]{.underline} and should continue to use their growing digital
prowess to expand their influence in the EU and NATO. Lithuania, under
the leadership of Foreign Minister Gabrielius 63 Landsbergis, has
increasingly stood up to China.30 Minister Landsbergis's stance towards
China led to him being named as one of Politico's 'most influential
people in Europe' -- and the only one to make the list from any of the
Baltic states.31 [Latvia has called upon China to respect the rules of
international cyberspace.32 It should be noted that this is certainly
not the first time that leaders from the Baltic states have appeared on
similar lists]{.underline}, granting small states representation on
lists where the usual larger powers within Europe enjoy substantial
representation. Such leadership should be emulated, and the digital
advances made by the Baltic states provides an ideal way to achieve
this, as many countries look to the Baltics as digital leaders.
Demonstrating leadership to allies: If ever there was a time, as well as
a concrete area for the Baltic states to showcase their strengths as
small states, demonstrating leadership in the cyber and tech fields
presents the perfect opportunity. [Estonia has been the Baltic champion
for cybersecurity and e-governance. Lithuania, and to a lesser extent
Latvia have shown signs of catching up. Much like offline matters, the
three Baltic states use opportunities to meet with US]{.underline} and
EU [leaders to highlight the dire security situation which the
Transatlantic alliance faces from a resurgent Russia]{.underline} --
they know from experience and contemporary matters. As the security of
cyberspace is one of the acute questions of global politics this
century33, cybersecurity and matters of digital warfare will be issues
which merit pressing resolve, which is constantly changing. Being on the
cutting edge will require countries to remain that way. While member of
the United Nations Security Council for the first time, Estonia made
cybersecurity a priority, along with the overall security of the
region.34 As well, when a member of the UN Security Council, Estonia
made it a point to align with the US and the UK to call Russia out over
a cyberattack directed at Georgia.35 Latvia and Lithuania have also been
active on such fronts. In 2021, Latvia signed an agreement with Poland
which establishes a framework for cooperation between Latvia's Military
Information Technology Security 64 Incident Team (MilCERT) and Poland's
National Cyber Security Center.36 Latvia is also taking the opportunity
to reach out to the United States to discuss cybersecurity in the
region.37 Lithuania has, as aforementioned, developed their own cyber
center the RCDC, which is a bilateral LithuanianUS initiative.38
Conclusion To conclude[, the domain of cyberspace will be an arena for
battle for the foreseeable future. All countries, governments,
militaries will be faced with such threats, and the likelihood of
businesses and private individuals being faced with such threats is
high.]{.underline} The Baltic states are no strangers to such threats
and have been leaders in facing up to them. Given the nature of threats
faced and the manner in which the Baltics have faced up to them, [it is
safe to say that the Baltic states will continue to rise up to the
challenges and keep up with the rapidly changing nature of cyber
threats. However, the last point is the most persisting challenge any
entity faces in cyberspace -- the need to not only consistently keep up
but remain steps ahead of adversaries. The bi- and multilateral
agreements made as well as the leadership demonstrated, and the digital
awareness can go a long way to not only meet contemporary and future
challenges but serve as examples and demonstrate
leadership.]{.underline} Cyber and hybrid threats are ominous, but on a
positive note, the Baltic states have achieved many remarkable
accomplishments in this field.

#### Strengthening Baltic cyber security spurs Taiwan-Lithuania cooperation

Lithuanian model for expanding Taiwan's ties with Baltic
States]{.underline}**",
https://www.caribbeannewsglobal.com/the-lithuanian-model-for-expanding-taiwans-ties-with-baltic-states/)LR

[The establishment of a representative office in Lithuania constitutes a
victory for Taiwan in its efforts to counter both international
isolation and the Chinese narrative of Taiwan's supposedly inevitable
international isolation.]{.underline} By focusing on a part of the world
that has not traditionally been an area for Taiwanese presence and
engagement, Taipei has also demonstrated the virtues of an asymmetrical
approach to combating China on the world stage. [This development also
exposes the fact that Beijing is willing to break its own rules on "One
China," in that it is now willing to punish states even when they
continue to abide by their "One-China Policy" by not establishing
official ties with Taiwan.]{.underline} Although the object of Beijing's
ire is ostensibly related to the nomenclature used for Taiwan's office
in Vilnius (which uses the word "Taiwan"), at a deeper level, the source
of its anger is the gains that Taiwan has made in Europe, an area where
China had hoped to increase its influence. Lithuania has taken some
risks in placing its bets on Taiwan, and besides the retaliation it is
currently facing, the move may also have cost it future economic
opportunities. [Consequently, it will be crucial for Taiwan to
demonstrate that Vilnius' risk-taking was not in vain. Already, a large
Taiwanese trade and investment delegation has visited the country, with
a total of 240 online and offline trade talks involving more than 150
Lithuanian firms and various Taiwanese ones.]{.underline} Taiwan must
build on the complementarity of the two economies to replicate its
successes in countries like the Czech Republic, where despite much
Chinese propaganda, [Taiwan has been a much more substantial investor
and job creator. Lithuania has a hard-working, highly educated and
productive workforce in the manufacturing sector, with strengths in
areas such as the laser industry---which has also become a target for
Chinese retaliation, with China deciding to halt cooperation between its
laser industry bodies and Lithuania.]{.underline} Trade forms the basis
of bilateral relations and must be mutually beneficial. Lithuania has
made it clear that it expects to reap the benefits of engagement with
Taiwan, a country with an economy approximately 11 times larger than its
own, as well as a highly advanced tech sector. Lithuania therefore
represents a golden opportunity for Taiwan to showcase the advantages of
engagement and to demonstrate that small and medium states not only can
afford to defy China but can actually benefit materially from doing so.
[Conversely, failure to build upon and to sustain this momentum could
dissuade prospective partners from going down that path. Thus, Taipei
must demonstrate a commitment to building prosperous and mutually
beneficial ties with its new Baltic ally,]{.underline} and the [tangible
results must materialize as expeditiously as possible]{.underline}. [The
potential for engagement between Taiwan and the Baltics goes well beyond
trade and investment, however. Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia all have
traditions of resistance to external aggression and, by virtue of their
proximity to Russia,]{.underline} [have developed their own strategies
to counter the security threat posed by their much more powerful -- and
like China, expansionist neighbor. **Taiwan and the Baltic states,**
therefore, **have much to learn from each other**, in areas **ranging
from cyber and hybrid warfare to the implementation of an asymmetrical
defense posture.** While Russia poses the more immediate threat to the
Baltic region underscored by apprehensions across the region that Moscow
could launch an invasion of Ukraine as early as next January -- it is
also clear that China has become a more active player in the region,
with all the risks of espionage, cyberattacks, co-optation, and hybrid
threats that this new presence entails. Countries like Lithuania that
have already defied Beijing are now bracing for the very real
possibility of cyberattacks against their institutions]{.underline}, and
this is an area where Taiwan's expertise in addressing such threats can
come in handy. [**Appropriate intelligence-sharing mechanisms** must
therefore be established to facilitate communication, threat mitigation,
and response; these are areas where, again, Baltic states can make real
gains from a deeper relationship with Taiwan, whose capabilities in the
cyber sector are larger by orders of magnitude.]{.underline} The
fledgling relationship with this part of Europe also creates
opportunities for Taiwan's indigenous defense industry, particularly in
the unmanned vehicle sector: for example, Taiwan donated 10 police
drones to Lithuania in October to assist the country as it deals with an
influx of refugees from Belarus. For its part, [Taiwan has much to learn
from the Baltic states in non-traditional military areas, particularly
in areas of state resilience and the concept of total
defense.]{.underline} For example, as it explores ways by which to
increase its deterrence against a Chinese attack, [the Taiwanese
military could learn important lessons from the Lithuanian Lietuvos
Šaulių Sąjunga ("Riflemen's Union"), the Estonian Defense League, and
the National Guard, initiatives that blend traditional military forces
with a militia and civilian component.]{.underline} Among other things,
Taiwan could learn from those countries' experiences in providing
training to these additional layers of defense, as well as how and where
to safely store weapons so that they can be quickly accessed by
paramilitary forces in times of national emergency. No doubt Taiwan
could learn a thing or two about forming and training a proper Reserve
Force. Taiwan and the Baltics can also identify areas for the joint
training of special forces and other units charged with waging
asymmetrical war against a much more powerful and better-equipped
opponent[. Latvia and Lithuania, in particular, have clearly signaled
their willingness to engage Taiwan more closely on such matters. For
this to happen, the Taiwanese government will have to be willing to go
beyond its traditional areas of engagement on security issues, and
civilian authorities will have to contend with a culture of historical
resistance within the ministry of national defense to the idea of giving
the population a role in national security]{.underline} (especially one
that involves arming them). But as with trade, Taipei will need to
overcome those difficulties and, as rapidly as possible, demonstrate to
its potential partners that it is ready to engage them in a way that is
mutually beneficial. As the experience with Lithuania shows, an
unprecedented window of opportunity has been created for Taiwan in the
Baltics -one that will not remain open indefinitely. While we cannot
expect results overnight, especially on security matters, [Taipei cannot
afford to drag its feet -- and must therefore be proactive in its
efforts to turn this potential into a source of real benefits for all
the countries involved. It has natural and willing partners in the
Baltics; Taipei, too, must demonstrate that it means what it
says.]{.underline} If it does well in that area, there is a high
likelihood that countries elsewhere will take notice. Failure to seize
this moment, however, could have long-term detrimental effects on
Taiwan's appeal, and thereby strengthen China's ability to deter
engagement with Taiwan. The ball, therefore, is very much in Taipei's
court. The main point: A window of opportunity has opened for Taiwan to
deepen its engagement with the Baltic states, a grouping of small
nations that also faces an existential threat from a powerful
authoritarian neighbor. In areas ranging from trade to non-traditional
defense, these states are natural allies for Taiwan, and provide a
chance for Taipei to showcase the real benefits of closer ties despite
threatened retaliation by Beijing.

[Adding to the worry, over the past five years China has steadily
increased its pressure on Taiwan, reducing the number of mainland
tourists who can visit the island, stripping away its few remaining
diplomatic partners, placing an embargo on certain Taiwanese exports,
ramping up military activities in its vicinity, conducting
cyber-attacks, and interfering in Taiwan s democratic
process.]{.underline} While Xi continues to publicly stress his
commitment to peaceful reunification" with Taiwan and has not introduced
an explicit timeline for achieving this objective, he has also said that
the Taiwan issue cannot be passed on from generation to generation."2 He
has set 2049 as the date by which China must achieve the great
rejuvenation of the Chinese nation," and achieving reunification" with
Taiwan is a core condition for that project.3 [Still, it remains
unlikely that Xi has already decided to use force against Taiwan, which
provides an opening for the United States to adjust its policies and
work with its allies to help prevent such an outcome. Although there is
debate over whether China will resort to force, China is clearly
developing capabilities needed to invade and occupy Taiwan.]{.underline}
Preparing for a conflict over Taiwan has driven China s military
modernization campaign for the past two and a half decades. [China has
invested significant resources in developing the tools to defeat Taiwan
and prevent the United States from coming to its aid, principally an
arsenal of accurate ballistic missiles, the world's largest navy,
hundreds of modern fighter aircraft and bombers, and advanced cyber and
counterspace assets]{.underline} The recommendations proposed, while
ambitious, are feasible in the current political climate in both
Washington and Tokyo, and, with sustained focus in both capitals, can be
implemented in the next five years. [While China has a number of options
it could take to put pressure on Taiwan---seizing an offshore island,
**initiating massive cyberattacks**, firing hundreds of ballistic
missiles to take out critical infrastructure, and conducting a
quarantine of the island]{.underline}---this paper focuses squarely on
how to deter and respond to an invasion of Taiwan. It does so in the
belief that Japan s appetite for assisting the United States in
countering Chinese aggression against Taiwan short of a full war is
politically challenging and likely limited[. China is not relying on its
inherent advantages, however, and has instead spent the last two and a
half decades developing capabilities designed to neutralize U.S. power
in the Taiwan Strait.]{.underline} Its military budget has grown from
\$14.3 billion in 1996 to \$252.3 billion in 2020, a nearly eighteenfold
increase (see figure 2).7 [Preparing for a conflict over Taiwan has
consistently driven Beijing s procurement decisions, and China can now
bring significant capabilities to bear.]{.underline} The PLA Navy (PLAN)
is now the largest navy in the world (as measured by the number of
ships, although the United States continues to exceed it by tonnage),
with 355 ships and submarines, and is set to grow by nearly 100 ships by
the end of the decade.8 The PLA Air Force is the largest air force in
the region and is rapidly catching up to Western air forces" and eroding
U.S. advantages, according to the U.S. Department of Defense.9 The PLA
has one thousand short-range ballistic missiles and six hundred
medium-range ballistic missiles in its arsenal.10 [China has also
established an advanced integrated air defense system on its east coast
that can cover Taiwan.]{.underline}11 [The PLA is now turning its
attention to addressing previous gaps that have persisted, such as
anti-submarine warfare, while also rapidly developing information,
cyber, and space and counterspace capabilities.]{.underline}12 Taiwan,
however, is belatedly recognizing the need to dramatically rethink and
invest in its defense. In 2017, its military leadership introduced the
Overall Defense Concept(ODC), which aims to develop asymmetric
approaches to fend off a Chinese invasion and calls for investing in a
large number of smaller, cheaper, and more mobile weapons.23 Rather than
seeking to defeat the PLA through attrition, ODC focuses on a decisive
fight near Taiwans shores and the prevention of a successful PLA
landing. Taiwan has steadily increased its defense budget in recent
years, which is now the highest it has ever been in absolute terms.24
More important is using these funds to resource an asymmetric strategy,
purchasing missiles, drones, and howitzers.25 There remain obstacles to
ODC s implementation, however, and more traditional thinking could well
make a comeback.26 All of this means that U.S. intervention on Taiwan s
behalf would be a risky and costly proposition, as China can now
challenge the United States across all domains and place U.S. aircraft,
surface vessels (including aircraft carriers), and bases throughout the
Indo-Pacific at risk. [In addition, the United States would for the
first time be fighting a nuclear-armed opponent with precision standoff
weapons, extensive cyberwarfare capabilities, and the ability to target
its satellites.27]{.underline}

[Russia's invasion of Ukraine has raised the specter of nuclear
war]{.underline}, as Russian President Vladimir Putin has placed his
nuclear forces at an elevated state of alert and has warned that any
effort by outside parties to interfere in the war would result in
"consequences you have never seen." [Such saber-rattling has
understandably made headlines and drawn notice in Washington. But if
China attempted to forcibly invade Taiwan]{.underline} and the United
States came to Taipei's aid, [the **threat of escalation could
outstrip** even the current nerve-wracking situation in
Europe]{.underline}. A recent war game, conducted by the Center for a
New American Security in conjunction with the NBC program "Meet the
Press," demonstrated just how quickly such a conflict could escalate.
The game posited a fictional crisis set in 2027, with the aim of
examining how the United States and China might act under a certain set
of conditions. The game demonstrated that [China's military
modernization and expansion of its nuclear arsenal]{.underline}---not to
mention the importance Beijing places on unification with Taiwan---[mean
that, in the real world, a fight between China and the United States
could very well go nuclear]{.underline}. [Beijing views Taiwan as a
breakaway republic. If the Chinese Communist Party decides to invade the
island, its leaders may not be able to accept failure]{.underline}
without seriously harming the regime's legitimacy. [Thus, the CCP might
be willing to take significant risks to ensure that the conflict ends on
terms that it finds acceptable]{.underline}. That would mean convincing
the United States and its allies that the costs of defending Taiwan are
so high that it is not worth contesting the invasion. While China has
several ways to achieve that goal, [from Beijing's perspective, using
nuclear weapons may be the most effective]{.underline} means to keep the
United States out of the conflict. China is several decades into
transforming its People's Liberation Army (PLA) into what the Chinese
President Xi Jinping has called a "world-class military" that could
defeat any third party that comes to Taiwan's defense. China's
warfighting strategy, known as "anti-access/area denial," rests on being
able to project conventional military power out several thousand miles
in order to prevent the American military, in particular, from
effectively countering a Chinese attack on Taiwan. Meanwhile, [a growing
nuclear arsenal provides Beijing with coercive leverage as well as
potentially new warfighting capabilities, which could increase the risks
of war and escalation]{.underline}. China has historically possessed
only a few hundred ground-based nuclear weapons. But last year, nuclear
scholars at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies and the
Federation of American Scientists identified three missile silo fields
under construction in the Xinjiang region. The Financial Times reported
that China might have carried out tests of hypersonic gliders as a part
of an orbital bombardment system that could evade missile defenses and
deliver nuclear weapons to targets in the continental United States. The
U.S. Department of Defense projects that by 2030, China will have around
1,000 deliverable warheads---more than triple the number it currently
possesses. Based on these projections, Chinese leaders may believe that
as early as five years from now the PLA will have made enough
conventional and nuclear gains that it could fight and win a war to
unify with Taiwan. [Our recent war game]{.underline}---in which members
of Congress, former government officials, and subject matter experts
assumed the roles of senior national security decision makers in China
and the United States---[illustrated that a U.S.-Chinese war could
escalate quickly]{.underline}. For one thing, it showed that [both
countries would face operational incentives to strike military forces on
the other's territory]{.underline}. In the game, such strikes were
intended to be calibrated to avoid escalation; both sides tried to walk
a fine line by attacking only military targets. But [such attacks
crossed red lines for both countries, and produced a **tit-for-tat cycle
of attacks that broadened the scope and intensity of the
conflict**]{.underline}. For instance, in the simulation, China launched
a preemptive attack against key U.S. bases in the Indo-Pacific region.
The attacks targeted Guam, in particular, because it is a forward
operating base critical to U.S. military operations in Asia, and because
since it is a territory, and not a U.S. state, the Chinese team viewed
striking it as less escalatory than attacking other possible targets. In
response, the United States targeted Chinese military ships in ports and
surrounding facilities, but refrained from other attacks on the Chinese
mainland. Nevertheless, both sides perceived these strikes as attacks on
their home territory, crossing an important threshold. Instead of
mirror-imaging their own concerns about attacks on their territory, each
side justified the initial blows as military necessities that were
limited in nature and would be seen by the other as such. Responses to
the initial strikes only escalated things further as the U.S. team
responded to China's moves by hitting targets in mainland China, and the
Chinese team responded to Washington's strikes by attacking sites in
Hawaii. A NEW ERA One particularly alarming finding from the war game is
that China found it necessary to threaten to go nuclear from the start
in order to ward off outside support for Taiwan. This threat was
repeated throughout the game, particularly after mainland China had been
attacked. At times, efforts to erode Washington's will so that it would
back down from the fight received greater attention by the China team
than the invasion of Taiwan itself. But China had difficulty convincing
the United States that its nuclear threats were credible. In real life,
China's significant and recent changes to its nuclear posture and
readiness may impact other nations' views, as its nuclear threats may
not be viewed as credible given its stated doctrine of no first use, its
smaller but burgeoning nuclear arsenal, and lack of experience making
nuclear threats. This may push China to preemptively detonate a nuclear
weapon to reinforce the credibility of its warning. [China might also
resort to a demonstration of its nuclear might because of constraints on
its long-range conventional strike capabilities]{.underline}. Five years
from now, the PLA still will have a very limited ability to launch
conventional attacks beyond locations in the "second island chain" in
the Pacific; namely, Guam and Palau. Unable to strike the U.S. homeland
with conventional weapons, China would struggle to impose costs on the
American people. Up until a certain point in the game, the U.S. team
felt its larger nuclear arsenal was sufficient to deter escalation and
did not fully appreciate the seriousness of China's threats. As a
result, China felt it needed to escalate significantly to send a message
that the U.S. homeland could be at risk if Washington did not back down.
Despite China's stated "no-first use" nuclear policy, the war game
resulted in Beijing detonating a nuclear weapon off the coast of Hawaii
as a demonstration. The attack caused relatively little destruction, as
the electromagnetic pulse only damaged the electronics of ships in the
immediate vicinity but did not directly impact the U.S. state. The war
game ended before the U.S. team could respond, but it is likely that the
first use of a nuclear weapon since World War II would have provoked a
response. The most likely paths to nuclear escalation in a fight between
the United States and China are different from those that were most
likely during the Cold War. The Soviet Union and the United States
feared a massive, bolt-from-the-blue nuclear attack, which would
precipitate a full-scale strategic exchange. In a confrontation over
Taiwan, however, Beijing could employ nuclear weapons in a more limited
way to signal resolve or to improve its chances of winning on the
battlefield. It is unclear how a war would proceed after that kind of
limited nuclear use and whether the United States could de-escalate the
situation while still achieving its objectives. AN OUNCE OF PREVENTION
[The clear lesson from the war game is that the United States needs to
**strengthen**]{.underline} its [**conventional capabilities** in the
Indo-Pacific to ensure that China **never views an invasion of Taiwan as
a prudent tactical move**]{.underline}. To do so, the United States will
need to commit to maintaining its conventional military superiority by
expanding its stockpiles of long-range munitions and investing in
undersea capabilities. Washington must also be able to conduct offensive
operations inside the first and second island chains even while under
attack. This will require access to new bases to distribute U.S. forces,
enhance their survivability, and ensure that they can effectively defend
Taiwan in the face of China's attacks. Moreover, [the United States
needs to]{.underline} develop an integrated network of partners willing
to **[contribute to Taiwan's defense]{.underline}**. Allies are an
asymmetric advantage: the United States has them, and China does not.
[The United States should **deepen strategic and operational planning**
with key partners to **send a strong signal of resolve** to
China]{.underline}. As part of these planning efforts, the United States
and its allies will need to develop war-winning military strategies that
do not cross Chinese red-lines. The game highlighted just how difficult
this task may be; what it did not highlight is the complexity of
developing military strategies that integrate the strategic objectives
and military capacities of multiple nations. Moving forward, military
planners in the United States and in Washington's allies and partners
must grapple with the fact that, in a conflict over Taiwan, China would
consider all conventional and nuclear options to be on the table. And
[the United States is **running out of time** to strengthen deterrence
and keep China from believing an invasion of Taiwan could be successful.
**The biggest risk** is that Washington and its friends choose not to
seize the moment and act: **a year or two from now**, it might already
be too late]{.underline}.

Demonstrating leadership to allies:

[If ever there was a **time**, as well as a **concrete
area**]{.underline} [for the Baltic states to showcase their strengths
as small states,]{.underline} [demonstrating **leadership** in the
**cyber** and **tech** fields presents the **perfect
opportunity**]{.underline}. [Estonia has been the]{.underline} Baltic
**[champion]{.underline}** [for cybersecurity and
e-governance]{.underline}. Lithuania, and to a lesser extent Latvia have
shown signs of catching up. Much like offline matters, the three Baltic
states use opportunities to meet with US and EU leaders to highlight the
dire security situation which the Transatlantic alliance faces from a
resurgent Russia  -- they know from experience and contemporary matters.

As the security of cyberspace is one of the acute questions of global
politics this century33, [cybersecurity and matters of digital warfare
will be issues which merit **pressing resolve**]{.underline}, which is
constantly changing. [Being on the **cutting edge** will require
countries to remain that way.]{.underline} While member of the United
Nations Security Council for the first time, [Estonia made
cybersecurity]{.underline} **[a priority]{.underline}**, along with the
overall security of the region.34 As well, when a member of the UN
Security Council, Estonia made it a point to align with the US and the
UK to call Russia out over a cyberattack directed at Georgia.35

[Latvia and Lithuania have]{.underline} **[also been]{.underline}**
[active]{.underline} on such fronts. In 2021, [Latvia signed an
agreement with Poland]{.underline} [which establishes]{.underline} a
framework for **[cooperation]{.underline}** between Latvia's Military
Information Technology Security Incident Team (MilCERT) and Poland's
National Cyber Security Center.36 [Latvia is]{.underline}

as aforementioned, [developed]{.underline} **[their own]{.underline}**
[cyber center]{.underline} the RCDC, which is a bilateral LithuanianUS
initiative.38

Conclusion

To conclude, the domain of [cyberspace will be]{.underline} **[an
arena]{.underline}** [for]{.underline} **[battle]{.underline}** for the
foreseeable future. **[All countries]{.underline}**, governments,
militaries [will be faced with such threats]{.underline}, and the
likelihood of businesses and private individuals being faced with such
threats is high. [The Baltic states]{.underline} **[are no
strangers]{.underline}** to such threats [and have been]{.underline}
**[leaders]{.underline}** in facing up to them. Given the nature of
threats faced and the manner in which the Baltics have faced up to them,
it is safe to say that the Baltic states will continue to rise up to the
challenges and keep up with the rapidly changing nature of cyber
threats. However, the last point is [the most persisting challenge **any
entity** faces]{.underline} in cyberspace -- [the need to]{.underline}
**[not only]{.underline}** [consistently keep up but]{.underline}
[**remain steps ahead** of adversaries]{.underline}. The bi- and
multilateral agreements made as well as the leadership demonstrated, and
the digital awareness can go a long way to not only meet contemporary
and future challenges but serve as examples and demonstrate leadership.
Cyber and hybrid threats are ominous, but on a positive note, the Baltic
states have achieved many remarkable accomplishments in this field.

### Modeling\-\--Middle East

#### The Middle East models.

The world is moving towards a digitised global society full of cyber
opportunities. However, as a fully cyber-connected society, this future
society will also have to cope with new patterns of conflict, such as
cyber-attacks and hybrid warfare.

[[The Baltic countries]{.underline}]{.mark} - Estonia, Latvia, and
Lithuania - which for years were under the control of the Union of
Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) and then forced to fight on the front
line of digital warfare, [[have been forced to]{.mark} **[take the
lead]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} this process of
**[cyber-innovation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Moscow\'s attacks on the
three pioneers of independence from the USSR have been a constant for
years. And they have grown exponentially since the early 2000s.

The Estonian example

The Republic of Estonia was one of the Kremlin\'s first targets in 2007.
Tallinn\'s decision to move the monument to the fallen Soviet soldiers
of World War II from the centre of the capital to the \'Bronze Soldier\'
cemetery provoked a wave of cyber-attacks from Russia that lasted more
than 20 days. Public and private organisations, ministries, banks, the
media and even the parliament itself were affected by hundreds of hacker
offensives.

\"The government website normally receives between 1,000 and 1,500 hits
a day; at the height of the attacks, in the first week of May, it
received between 1,000 and 1,500 per second,\" explained defence
spokesman Mikko Maddis at the time. \"It blew up the system.

Fearing that the attack was just the prelude to a larger-scale cyber
offensive, Estonia armoured itself. The small country shifted as many
government services and systems as possible to new, private and secure
networks, improving cyber security and protecting itself against the
effects of digital warfare. This path also led Tallinn to transfer
citizen services and the most basic government functions to blockchain
technology.

Today, Estonia has become a country capable of dealing with almost any
cyber threat; defined by The New Yorker as a \"digital republic\", its
citizens have the opportunity to access virtually all available
government services online, and its political and economic leaders to
run it effectively from anywhere in the world.

Indeed, in 2014 Tallinn spearheaded the world\'s first e-residency
programme, aiming to exceed 10 million residents by 2025. And while it
has so far failed to add more than 85,000 residents, it has enabled more
than 19,000 entrepreneurs to consolidate new digital companies that do
not need to be physically present.

Russia\'s threat to Lithuania

The situation in neighbouring [[Lithuania]{.underline}]{.mark},
meanwhile, follows a similar fate. In the context of the Russian
invasion of Ukraine, the country\'s main electricity company, Ignitis,
[[suffered]{.mark} a **few weeks ago**]{.underline} what has been
considered [[the **biggest computer attack**]{.mark} [in the **last
decade**]{.mark}]{.underline}. As the company itself reported in a press
release, the blocking of its website and other electronic services was
delayed for several hours until it could be repelled.

This attack, perpetrated according to Lithuanian sources by the Russian
hacker group Killnet, was seen as part of Russian retaliation for the
partial blockade of freight transport to the Kaliningrad Oblast. A
strategic enclave for Moscow, located on the Baltic Sea halfway between
Belarus and Poland, it allows Moscow to maintain a geopolitical sphere
of influence in the region. \"[[The offensive will
**continue**]{.underline}]{.mark} until Lithuania lifts the block,\" the
organisation told Reuters, \"so far we have destroyed 1,652 web
resources\".

Russian-Ukrainian cyberwarfare

The war between Kiev and Moscow has also become another theatre of
hybrid warfare. As the wave of Russian cyberattacks against Ukraine
prior to the start of the invasion had already foreshadowed, the digital
contest has also played an important role in the Kremlin\'s offensive;
the massive distribution of malware, targeted attacks on highly critical
infrastructure, and large-scale offensives against other Ukrainian
websites (mainly through DDoS viruses, which make it impossible to
access portals) have been just another weapon in Moscow\'s arsenal.

However, in such a scenario both sides have deployed their own
\"armies\" and allies. While groups involved in ransomware-type attacks,
such as Conti, have declared their support for the Russian regime,
others, such as Anonymus, have declared war on Putin - conducting
information exposure campaigns - and joined Kiev\'s \"cyber army\".

And in the future?

All this is evidence of the special importance of the cyber world on the
international stage. Although the \"Baltic laboratory\" hardly seems
exportable to other much larger and less technologically and digitally
developed countries, most [[**experts** and
**analysts**]{.underline}]{.mark} stress that it is necessary to know
and **[[monitor]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[Estonian, Latvian and
Lithuanian actions]{.mark} in their defence against Russian
cyberattacks]{.underline}. [[The decisions taken by the]{.mark}
small]{.underline}, once-Soviet [[states will serve as a
**guide**]{.underline}]{.mark} to the characteristics and patterns of
future cyber-conflicts.

According to technology expert Joseph Dana for the Syndication Bureau,
[[it is]{.mark} now **[Middle Eastern]{.mark}**
[countries]{.mark}]{.underline} - such as the United Arab Emirates and
Israel - [[that are paying]{.mark} **[most
attention]{.mark}**]{.underline} [to the features of these new
wars]{.underline}, [and [to **cyber-defence**]{.mark}
[strategies]{.mark}]{.underline}. The reason for this is twofold. In
addition to the large Emirati investment over the past decade to follow
the Estonian model, \"Emirati officials have also discussed the need to
build a better cybersecurity infrastructure to safeguard the nation\'s
knowledge economy\".

Thus, many analysts have agreed that, [[should conflict **break out**
between the Gulf states and Iran]{.underline}]{.mark},
**[[cyberattacks]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[would be]{.mark}come
[a]{.mark} **[weapon of choice]{.mark}**]{.underline} for both sides.
Indeed, Israel and the Persian Islamic Republic have already exchanged
several digital and technological offensives, and it is feared that
these could extend beyond military infrastructure.

#### Cooperation with Estonia is key -- promotes cybersecurity for all of NATO

Even the pandemic has the potential for fomenting political unrest. 

In recent days, thousands of Serbs have taken to the streets to protest
Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic's announced strict curfew in response
to a surge in Covid-19 cases. Many have pointed a finger
at pro-Russia ultra-right groups and foreign intelligence services for
fueling the violent riots.

Moscow denies any "Russian trace" in the unrest. Whether Russia is
behind the violent protests in Belgrade remains to be seen. One thing is
for certain. The Kremlin's efforts to sow mayhem in the Balkans would
not be new; this would merely be the latest attempt by a resurgent
Russia to threaten Euro-Atlantic security and challenge the United
States' ability to defend its interests in Europe. 

[Russia is promoting]{.underline} its [interests in the]{.underline}
Western [Balkans through the **widespread use** of
**disinfo**rmation]{.underline} and cyberwarfare. [The
U.S.]{.underline}, however, [isn't helpless. It has an **opportunity**
to]{.underline} obtain insights into these efforts and **[counter
Russia\'s influence]{.underline}** campaigns. [**It is time** to
confront]{.underline} Russia\'s strongman Vladimir [Putin\'s **cyber
games**]{.underline} before American interests are permanently damaged
in the Balkans. 

The U.S. and the E.U. have long been ambivalent about defining their
interests in the Western Balkans. [Russia has **capitalized**
on]{.underline} these [**years of neglect** and leveraged a **power
vacuum**]{.underline} in the former Yugoslavia [to gain]{.underline}
economic and political [influence. The region is now at the forefront of
Russia\'s]{.underline} use of low-cost [strategies to]{.underline}
expand its global influence and **[undermine western
interests]{.underline}**. 

[Russian disinformation]{.underline}, aided by repeated cyberattacks on
government institutions, [was instrumental in]{.underline} the
[2016]{.underline} Moscow-sponsored coup attempt [in
Montenegro]{.underline}. In North Macedonia, Russia spread
disinformation prior to the name-change referendum that finally enabled
North Macedonia to join NATO. It also established hundreds of North
Macedonia-based "troll factories,\" from which Russia pedaled fake news
against the 2016 U.S. elections. Facebook recently banned troll farms
from North Macedonia that pushed COVID-19 disinformation. 

Moscow has also been investing in critical sectors in Croatia. With its
strategy of fomenting political divisions, the Kremlin has been
exploiting internal conflicts in Albania. In Bosnia and Herzegovina,
disinformation campaigns have sown ethnic and religious discord,
while promoting the secession of ethnic Serb regions from Bosnia. In
response, the U.S. should encourage the transatlantic integration for
Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Western Balkans' most fragile country. 

Russia has used state-sponsored media to promote nationalist and
anti-Western narratives in Serbia, including the opening of
a Sputnik office in Belgrade. Also,  Russian-run "Humanitarian
Center" in Serbia is very close to the main NATO based in Kosovo (Camp
Bondsteel). Some European and American officials fear that it serves as
a base for the Kremlin intelligence-gathering activities to eavesdrop on
U.S. interests in the Balkans. 

[[Russia's]{.underline}]{.mark} preeminent [[goals]{.mark} in the
Balkans [have been to **refine**]{.mark} their
**[disinfo]{.mark}**rmation **[tactics]{.mark}** and **erode Western
influence** in the region]{.underline}, including in Croatia,
Montenegro, North Macedonia and Albania, which are all NATO members.
[The West needs to **aggressively respond** to this Russian posture,
including using a **cyber-focused campaign** to **counter Russia\'s
provocations**. ]{.underline}

For crafting such a strategy, [[the **West should look to
Estonia**]{.underline}]{.mark}. After the 2007 Russian cyberattack on
Estonian government institutions, [[Estonia became a global leader in

[expertise]{.mark}**]{.underline}. A similar approach by the West would
benefit the Western Balkans, where information and communication
technology sector is the most promising and the fastest growing economic
sector in the region. In Serbia alone, the I.T. sector generates more
than 10% of GDP with a similar trend in other countries in the region,
which have some of the highest numbers of outsourced I.T. workers per
capita in Europe. 

[An]{.underline} [**American-led strategy** should focus on creating
a]{.underline} regional **[cyber-security infrastructure]{.underline}**
in the Western Balkans, **[modeled on Estonia\'s example]{.underline}**.
Given that countries in the Western Balkans share the same

[a]{.underline} regional [**hub for cybersecurity** would allow states
to **cooperate among each other** in **cyber deterrence**,
**attribution** of attacks and collective
**countermeasures**]{.underline}. 

Several countries [in the [Western Balkans]{.mark}]{.underline} have
joined NATO, but [alliances are]{.underline} notoriously
**[unreliable]{.underline}**, especially among the smaller states.

in the U.S., North Macedonia, Croatia and Montenegro, [countries should
continue **cooperating** to counter **malicious Russian cyber
activities**]{.underline}. 

[The U.S. can]{.underline} learn more about Russian cyber tactics at the

cyber-team** to **strengthen NATO's countries' cyber-capabilities** in
an effort to **thwart future Russian network intrusions**]{.underline}
such as the one that was undertaken by Russian intelligence operators in
Bulgaria in 2017. 

Serbia, a key ally to Moscow in the region, remains the biggest obstacle
to countering Russian influence. Serbia just had parliamentary elections
boycotted by the opposition that resulted in Vucic\'s Serbian
Progressive party winning a landslide victory and further strengthening
his power. The close Russia-Serbian relationship can make it difficult
to detect Russia\'s subversive activities. 

Of all the Western Balkans countries, Serbia had the highest military
expenditure in 2019, and President Vucic thanked Russia for making
Serbia's military 10 times stronger since NATO intervention in 1999.
After Russia employed an S-400 missile system in Serbia for a military
drill, the Pantsir S1 air-defense systems were delivered this past
February, despite a looming U.S. sanctions threat.  

Should Serbia continue obtaining Russian weapons, Washington should
impose sanctions. Serbia must understand that its strategy of neutrality
is unacceptable to the U.S., as are its claims to balance their
interests among Russia, China and the West. [[The U.S. should
remain]{.mark} **solidly [committed]{.mark}**]{.underline}, leading
efforts to solve the Kosovo dispute and wrest control of that narrative

While variances in the national interests may complicate cooperation

vital objectives** that make cooperation **possible** and]{.underline}
even [**attractive** under **U.S. leadership**]{.underline}. Among these
are the historical fear of Russian domination and a desire for E.U. and

[Estonia does not have a standalone policy of cyber deterrence, but
strategic documents relating to national security, foreign policy and
cybersecurity describe diverse components of cyber
deterrence.]{.underline} Cybersecurity is deemed a part of foreign,
security and defence policy, as well as domestic/internal security. It
is also included in strategic documents and policies concerning digital
modernization, technology, education and research, and so forth. The
review and analysis of Estonia's strategic documents associated with
cybersecurity (presented in Annex I) shows that two concepts --
cross-domain deterrence and cyber deterrence -- play an important role
in the government's cybersecurity discourse. [Three layers of deterrence
-- entanglement and norms, denial and punishment -- are equally
upheld.]{.underline} Generally speaking, the analysis demonstrates that
in the Estonian national security discourse, deterrence by denial and
punishment tend to be conceptualized in the context of national security
and defence policy; entanglement and norms in the context of foreign
policy and cyber diplomacy; and denial (domestic defence/resilience) in
the context of digital and technology policies. In the latest strategy
(2019--2022), cyber deterrence is referenced almost as frequently as in
the 2014--2017 document, apart from the fact that cross-domain
deterrence and military deterrence are not mentioned. [Rather, concerns
about challenges relating to digital modernization and technology
policies come to the fore in this strategy. The last column of Table 2
provides examples of how a deterrence tool has been
implemented.]{.underline} ![Table Description automatically

capacity, Estonia established a position in 2018 for an
ambassador-at-large for cybersecurity. Estonia is one of the leaders
among the Baltic and Nordic countries when it comes to cyber
diplomacy.]{.underline} It has been a member of the UN Group of
Governmental Experts for many years, and is also a leader in cyber
diplomacy education for foreign diplomats.35 As a member of the UN
Security Council in 2020-- 2021, in June 2021 [Estonia organized for the
first time in the Council's history an open meeting on cybersecurity,
where it raised the issue of state behaviour in cyberspace in the
context of international peace and security]{.underline}.36 Since 2008,
[Estonia has hosted the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of
Excellence (CCDCOE), which sponsors the publication of world-renowned
scholarly works on international law applicable]{.underline} to
cyberspace -- the Tallinn Manuals 1.0 (2013), 2.0 (2017), and the
forthcoming volume 3.0.37 [Deterrence by denial, conceptualized in
Estonia primarily as domestic defence/resilience measures, is
foundational for the country's cybersecurity posture]{.underline}.38
Deterrence in this area includes a full spectrum of activities
prescribed in the national cybersecurity strategies, in cybersecurity
legislation and other relevant ministerial regulations. [Some of the
resilience-related objectives have remained constant since 2008, such as
applying measures to harden networks (for example, standards, risk
analysis and management tools, incident response, raising awareness,
building cybersecurity capacity and competence, to name a
few).]{.underline}39 In June 2021, Estonia published its first national
information security standard entitled E-ITS, which is a guideline for
public and private network owners and operators to ensure minimum
security standards.40 The Estonian Information System Authority
regularly alerts stakeholders and the general public to cyber threats,
vulnerabilities and exploits, and helps them to protect their networks.
[These activities contribute to deterrence by denial by increasing the
ability to protect networks and recover from cyber incidents. Public
attribution can be regarded as a tool for deterrence.]{.underline}46
Indeed, among Estonian experts, public attribution is regarded as a
primary tool of cyber deterrence.47 As noted by scholars, one aim of
public attribution is the act of norm-setting -- that is, establishing
"the rules of the road" and subsequently enforcing appropriate behaviour
in cyberspace (response measures).48 In a similar manner, the Estonian
government holds that "public statements on attribution can be made,
with the aim of increasing accountability in cyberspace and emphasising
the importance of adhering to international law obligations and norms of
responsible state behaviour".49 [The Estonian Ministry of Foreign
Affairs subscribes to the opinion that "public attribution \[...\]
allows states to send clear messages and shape expectations that
malicious cyberspace operations will not be tolerated" and "it is
necessary to send a message that harmful cyberspace operations are not
part of acceptable state behaviour".]{.underline}50 In other words,
Estonia directly links public attribution to setting cyber norms, thus
connecting deterrence by entanglement and norms to legal consequences,
namely deterrence by punishment. According to this view, Estonia
supports public attribution and collective measures "where possible" and
"public attribution and messaging are tools for deterring and responding
\[...\] but also for raising wider awareness".51 To support collective
public attribution and to hold violators responsible, [**Estonia
actively contributes to** EU and **NATO cyber deterrence discussions,
and belongs to the US-led international cyber deterrence
initiative**]{.underline}.52 [**Based on the Estonian case study**, a
policy recommendation for EU and **NATO countries is to apply a
three-layered deterrence model**]{.underline}.73 First, EU and [NATO
countries should participate in entanglement and norms measures such as
cyber diplomacy and capacity-building globally. Second, they should
invest more in denial measures and, third, jointly develop policies for
punitive response options, including developing public attribution
procedures to enable quick attribution, and systematically implementing
sanctions regimes.]{.underline} It would be feasible to establish
memoranda of understanding, and operational- and technical-level
frameworks to radically improve information- and intelligence-sharing.
Participation in cyber defence and crisis management exercises should be
open to like-minded NATO partner countries. Joint bilateral cyberspace
operations likewise contribute to mutual trust-building and
information-sharing, and increase parties' operational and technical
competence.74 Operational- and technical-level joint activities should
be regularly practised among allies and with like-minded partners as
they contribute to deterrence by denial. Given that NATO's cyber With
regard to deterrence by denial, Estonia, together with other EU and NATO
countries, should develop a zero trust security strategy and
architecture.75 Zero trust is a cybersecurity paradigm that treats
networks as untrusted, and that moves defences from static,
network-based perimeters to focus on users, assets, and resources. It
assumes that there is no implicit trust granted to user accounts or
assets in any network segment (including a corporate local area
network), and applies authentication and authorization before a session
is established.76 While deterrence might work at the high end, novel
security principles should be implemented by governments because
deterrence is not sufficient to deter cyberattacks. Estonia's public
attribution guidelines serve as a blueprint for other countries to
attribute cyberattacks and impose meaningful costs. A sharper focus on
responses to high- and low-end cyberattacks should be developed in the
future along with concrete deterrence actions and tools for individual
75 For example, the US government has released a strategy, architecture
and maturity model that the US federal government agencies will
implement: 'Moving the U.S. Government Towards Zero Trust Cybersecurity
Principles', The White House, https://zerotrust.cyber.gov/. 76 Scott

types. For example, deterrence tools can differ for diverse targets:
internet voting and e-health systems would be targeted by different
cyber threat actors that have political or criminal motives, and the
same tool is not effective across all actors. [Estonia's forms of cyber
deterrence are not effective individually, nor every time, but **when
implemented together in a whole-of-society approach, and systematically
over a longer period of time,** it is likely that **many malicious
cyberattacks can be deterred.**]{.underline} As Joseph Nye pointed out,
deterrence tools "can complement one other in affecting actors'
perceptions of the costs and benefits of particular actions".[77
Certainly, one cannot deter all cyberattacks -- especially those
conducted as part of malicious influencing campaigns below the threshold
of the use of force -- however, it is possible to reduce the number and
effect of strategic cyberspace operations.]{.underline} It is likely
that punitive responses may deter hostile actors from conducting similar
attacks in the future. It will remain to be seen whether the EU and
[**NATO can deter cyberattacks** both above and below the threshold of
an armed attack better in the future **when they apply systematically
stronger punitive responses.**]{.underline}

3\. NATO AS A CYBERSPACE ALLIANCE [The logic of international alliance
is that bigger is usually better when defending against
threats.5]{.underline} Although the size of the alliance and the need
for consensus can complicate warfighting,6 the concept of a common
defense means that an adversary faces the combined militaries of
multiple countries. In a world in which attackers are dissuaded by the
prospect that united countries will interpose their forces between
attackers and those being defended, the premise that more is better
makes intuitive sense. [But combat in cyberspace does not really benefit
from economies of scale]{.underline}. Within a country, [adding
more]{.underline} offensive [cyber warriors]{.underline} often
[means]{.underline} lowering the qualifications (at least initially, and
perhaps in the long term) for what is, by nature, an inherently elite
profession. This [means not only that]{.underline} [diminishing
returns]{.underline} set in, [but that]{.underline} the [activities of
the good-but-not-great can well tip off the other side]{.underline}. So
tipped, the other side can improve its defenses in ways that are
specific (e.g., vulnerabilities are patched after having been
discovered) and general (i.e., a shift occurs in the tradeoff between
security and cost/convenience). Correspondingly, the contribution of
additional operators is limited. When these operators come from other
countries, their contribution is further vitiated unless these countries
operate seamlessly. Within an intelligence-sharing alliance (e.g., the
Five Eyes), additional members do add heft (each country, for instance,
can employ relationships that it has developed with communications
companies around the world). Once seams intrude -- and these seams are
larger within NATO than within the Five Eyes -- the level of
coordination is less and the prospects for interference (e.g., two
countries seeking access to the same target system) are greater. When it
comes to defense, the arguments that vitiate the benefits mass are
different but similar. A large percentage of all [cyber defense efforts
requires looking after specific systems.]{.underline} Adding allies adds
more systems to defend. This hardly helps defenders of existing
systems.7 [Although there are defense activities where adding countries
may help]{.underline} -- e.g., intelligence fusion, collective learning,
and forensics -- **[none of these really requires a military
alliance,]{.underline}** and some of the contributors for these three
efforts live in the private realm. Alliances also express their weight
through deterrence policies. In the Cold War, the United States deterred
attacks by the Soviet Union on NATO allies with a nuclear threat:
certainly, if the attacks involved nuclear weapons, and quite possibly
if the attack involved overwhelming conventional force. In recent years
the U.S. deterrence policy in cyberspace has been notionally extended to
a NATO deterrence policy. Unfortunately, U.S. deterrence policy for
attacks on the homeland is already an uncertain thing -- and extending
it adds further uncertainties. There are, for instance, serious
questions about what constitutes a cyberattack serious enough to merit
retaliation and what the form of retaliation would be; the United States
has used sanctions in response to malign cyberspace activities, but
there is little evidence that sanctions have deterred Russia, Iran, or
North Korea.8 NATO's retaliation capabilities -- which are largely US
retaliation capabilities (plus some UK capabilities) -- are even less
likely to be brought into play if the target of a cyberattack were
European. In the five years prior to North Korea's hack of Sony -- which
the United States did respond to -- South Korea suffered far worse
depredations with no U.S. response.9 4. AND WHY IS THE NATO GROUPING NOT
THE OBVIOUS ONE? Yet Europeans lean on NATO; in large part, because it
already exists and therefore does not need to be invented. But NATO is a
military alliance, while cyberspace is essentially a conduit for
information,10 hence generally dominated by the community that deals
with information qua intelligence. And the existence of the Five Eyes
coalition only underlines this point: working relationships among that
coalition in the information domain are tighter than they are in the
information domain across the NATO alliance. And two of the Five Eyes
are not even in NATO. In other words, the real coalition is not doing
Europe (the UK excepted) in particular that much good. This matters,
because the primary cyber war threat to Europe is from Russia, and the
primary targets of Russian coercion are in European countries that face
Russia. Two of the countries that face the gravest threats are not even
in NATO. Correspondingly[, a Baltic cyberspace alliance]{.underline}
would have a limited ambit: members would cooperate on defense and aver
that a cyberattack on one is an attack on all. In practice, were such an
arrangement made, the alliance [would have its own definition of what
constitutes an "attack"; it might include social media
manipulation]{.underline}. A cyberspace alliance, as such, would have
three facets but lack one. The [first facet is defense: each country
would putatively participate more vigorously in]{.underline} those
[cyber defense activities that benefit from scale, as
noted]{.underline}: **[threat intelligence, forensics, lessons
learned.]{.underline}** [With very large cyberattacks]{.underline},
[they could offer mutual aid for systems restoration]{.underline}. T[he
second facet is]{.underline} defense by [deterrence]{.underline}. It
[would require a consensus on what constitutes an actionable offense in
cyberspace]{.underline}, notably the type and severity; what responses
are appropriate (e.g., to an attack on the local power grid); and what
kind of capability is required to retaliate in cyberspace. One rationale
for responding in cyberspace is that less forceful options, such as
alliance-wide sanctions, are likely to be even weaker than U.S.
sanctions are. Conversely, threatening kinetic responses -- given the
lack of nuclear weapons among proposed alliance members -- lacks
credibility thanks to Russia's escalation dominance. The third facet
would consist of [offensive cyberspace operations used for]{.underline}
coercive or, more likely[, counter-coercive purposes or for retaliation
against grave non-cyber offenses]{.underline} (e.g., the Skripal
poisonings11). By contrast, cyberspace operations in support of kinetic
operations (e.g., taking a SAM site offline while a NATO sortie flies
overhead) would fall outside such an alliance because kinetic operations
fall to NATO; if individual members carried out tactical cyberattacks,
they would fall under NATO auspices (or their own fights). 5.
CHARACTERISTICS AND ADVANTAGES OF A BALTIC CYBERSPACE ALLIANCE What are
the characteristics and advantages of such an alliance to its member
countries? First, [the alliance, limited to cyberspace]{.underline},
[would invariably focus on Russia]{.underline}, despite having to tend
to other threats (e.g., from China's commercially-motivated
cyberespionage) and despite the possibility that alliance members would
probably be diplomatic in public about the alliance's purpose. [Russia's
cyberspace threats are malevolent]{.underline}, politically-directed,
[and often part of a larger campaign to sow disorder and facilitate
coercion]{.underline}. NATO countries, as a whole, are not entirely
focused on Russia, these days: those in North America pay as much
attention to China;12 those near the Mediterranean tend to look
southward. Second, such an alliance would include currently neutral
countries, notably Sweden and Finland. Both countries punch above their
weight, in cyberspace operations13 and information operations14
respectively. This raises the question: why don't such countries just
enter NATO? To be sure, roughly half the citizens in both countries
would like to -- but the other half fear, justifiably, a neuralgic
Russian reaction if they did (Finland's accession could put troops along
miles of Russian borders). Although Russians would likely react badly to
the formation of a Baltic cyberspace alliance, they would have a more
difficult time summoning images of jackbooted soldiers while doing so.
For Sweden and Finland, the cyberspace alliance could serve as a halfway
house. If the Russian threat eases, their entry into NATO can be
indefinitely postponed (in the unlikely event that the Russian
cyberspace threat disappears, they can leave or the cyberspace alliance
might wither away). If the Russian threat persists or worsens, these two
countries will have had more practice interoperating with NATO
countries, thereby easing their way into an alliance that spans the
conventional domains of warfare. Third, a [cyberspace alliance would be
a mechanism to get Germany to become more involved]{.underline} --
[or]{.underline}, more to the point, [take leadership]{.underline} --
[in defending Europ]{.underline}e against Russia. The [current
contribution of German]{.underline} military [spending]{.underline} (1.2
percent of GDP) to the common defense of NATO [is modest]{.underline}.
Germany, [nevertheless]{.underline}, remains Europe's largest economy,
and would constitute roughly half of the weight of any Baltic cyberspace
alliance. [Germany]{.underline} [has]{.underline} also [stepped up
smartly in developing]{.underline} its [Cyber]{.underline} and
Information Domain [Service]{.underline}. Its manning, if plans hold,15
would constitute 7.5 percent of Germany's total force level (13,500 out
of 180,000);16 its spending would be 6.3 percent of Germany's military
(41.5 billion Euro) budget.17 By way of contrast, USCYBERCOM's
end-strength goal of 6,000 compares to 1.3 million military personnel in
the overall U.S. military -- less than a tenth as much concentration on
cyberspace. Granted, this is not an apples-to-apples comparison:
Germany's end strength includes electronic warfare battalions;
USCYBERCOM's end-strength does not. But, even after adjustments,
[Germany's commitment to fighting in cyberspace, relative to its overall
military strength, looks more substantial than the U.S.
commitment.]{.underline} Furthermore[, a German focus on
cyberspace]{.underline} (vis-à-vis kinetic elements of military power)
[is]{.underline}, again, [less likely to engender a neuralgic reaction
from Russia]{.underline} (no jackboots, etc.) [but does put Russia on
notice that its maneuvers in cyberspace have not gone unnoticed and will
be resisted by those best placed to resist them.]{.underline} **[The
advantage of such an alliance]{.underline}** to its members is that they
put the power of all in service of each. This **[should give Russians
second thoughts]{.underline}** [about]{.underline} their **[use of
cyberspace for offensive purposes]{.underline}** -- although it may also
initially goad them into carrying out operations against the non-NATO
countries (Sweden and Finland) to inhibit their participation in such an
alliance. Russia's doing so, conversely, could very well reinforce the
value to today's neutral countries of having others to lean on when
facing Russia. The countries in this alliance would be self-selected by
virtue of their concern over Russian activities in cyberspace. By
contrast, [a unified and meaningful NATO response]{.underline} to
Russian provocations has to surmount the objections of countries that
reserve some sympathy for Russia (Hungary and Greece come to mind).
Fourth, this [would give NATO competition in the alliance
business.]{.underline} Arguably, this would weaken NATO -- and is
thereby a disadvantage. But competition can also be good: it persuades
competitors to listen to their clients (customers, audience, etc.) and
induces them to innovate in order to retain their standing. Otherwise,
secure in the knowledge that their position is unassailable, they risk
becoming sluggish and unresponsive -- and when they fall or come apart,
it is often "first slowly and then all at once".18 Thus, [when offering
cyber security or countering cyberattacks, **relevant countries can
ask** the institutions of NATO and also those of the **Baltic cyberspace
alliance what each of them can do** --]{.underline} [each knowing that
they are competing both against Russia's malign influence and the
other's benign influence.]{.underline} But competition can also raise
problems: an institutionally aggressive cyberspace alliance may seek
greater influence by stretching the definition of a cyberattack: e.g.,
to include electronic warfare, interference with space operations, and
sabotage of or attacks on information infrastructures. 6. ADVANTAGES FOR
THE UNITED STATES [The most basic advantage is that it makes Europeans
more responsible for their own defense]{.underline}, albeit in just this
one domain. In the 1980s, for example, three neutral countries --
Switzerland, Sweden, and Finland -- spent far higher proportions of
their income on national defense than most European NATO allies did.19
[The "free rider" problem is, if anything, worse today.]{.underline} It
may be that much more difficult to persuade European countries to arm
themselves if, when such arms have to be used, it would be under a war
effort led by the United States. The return of Russia as an aggressive
power, since roughly late 2013, may not have been internalized by
European countries, concerned as they are with internal fissures -- many
of which, ironically, were deliberately exacerbated by Russia's
information warfare campaign. **[And the U.S. pivot to
Asia]{.underline}**, while more advertised than practiced, [would
necessarily mean **a shift in U.S. resources** that would otherwise be
available for Europe.]{.underline} But [in cyberspace]{.underline},
[countries in a Baltic cyberspace alliance would be pooling their
resources]{.underline} under either their own individual command ([as
befits an activity so highly linked to intelligence]{.underline}) or, at
least under the command of Europeans. And with the United States not in
such an alliance, [there is much less of a "free rider"
problem]{.underline} (even if Germany would be roughly half the
alliance, countries such as Sweden, Finland, and Estonia punch above
their weight in this domain). The downside of the upside is akin to the
owner of a hammer being persuaded that every problem is a nail: if given
a choice between responding to hostile actions in the kinetic world and
responding in cyberspace, the latter may be seen as particularly
attractive because it relies on tools the alliance can wield themselves
rather than tools largely wielded by the United States. Another
advantage for the United States is that such an alliance may complicate
Russia's cyber war efforts -- largely by increasing the uncertainty that
Russian efforts may be met with reprisals: the odds of retaliation from
either the United States (as the premier cyberspace power of NATO) or
from the Baltic cyberspace alliance will be higher than the odds of
retaliation from each of them. This is particularly true for those
cyberattacks that leave multiple victims: NotPetya, as an example,
levied costs in the hundreds of millions of dollars from Merck and
Federal Express (both U.S.-headquartered corporations) and from Maersk
(headquartered in Denmark). The raised odds for a response may arise
from meeting credibility thresholds (the United States may be wary and
the Baltic cyberspace alliance less so or vice versa), attribution
thresholds (the United States may have confidence and the Baltic
cyberspace alliance may not or vice versa), and damage thresholds (the
United States may recognize a higher threshold to warrant its
retaliation if the effects of the cyberattack fall primarily on
Europeans). Both the United States and the Baltic cyberspace alliance
may retaliate but against different targets.20 [An associated benefit is
that if the modus operandi of whatever cyberspace operations ensue from
NATO]{.underline} (that is, in practice, from the United States or the
UK) [and the Baltic cyberspace alliance are sufficiently
similar]{.underline}, [it may not be clear to Russia who struck
back]{.underline}. **[This would complicate
counter-retaliation]{.underline}** targeting (and threats), in
anticipation of which retaliation may be more likely, [and the prospect
thereof more credible]{.underline}. To be fair, attack-retaliation
cycles in cyberspace remain loose: the closest example of a retaliatory
cyberattack was the late 2012 DDOS campaign against U.S. banks by an
Iran that had, two years earlier, discovered that its nuclear program
had been set back by the Stuxnet worm.
Attack-retaliation-counter-retaliation cycles are even more nthorder
relationships. Furthermore, Russia may have the SIGINT or HUMINT to make
its own attribution -- or it may not care and may conclude that the
Baltic cyberspace alliance is an arm of NATO despite the former having
neutral countries in it; indeed, it may see all opposing alliances as
arms of the United States, facts notwithstanding.

In conclusion[, taking into account the current geopolitical situation
and the number of commitments in the international arena, the Baltic
States are likely to remain strong US allies and important US security
partners in Europe.]{.underline} **[Analysts believe that close
cooperation between the United States and the Baltic States will
continue for the foreseeable future]{.underline}** in areas such as
efforts to deter potential Russian aggression, the future of NATO,
energy security, and socioeconomic issues[. As long as there are
objective fears of peace demolition, NATO is interested in deepening
cooperation with like-minded countries. **There is still work to be done
within the Baltic region to strengthen resistance to Russian propaganda

standards in the socio-economic field**. This work will follow, for
instance, the example of banning Russian propaganda in the media. To
achieve this, the Baltic States will likely continue to rely on the
United States for leadership on foreign policy and security issues. This
can be seen from current partnership programs devoted to enhancing
defence power and providing training and an educational
practicum.]{.underline} This reliance is not only from the side of the
Baltic region; it is seen as a reciprocal one[. For instance, there are
climate change issues where Lithuania can share its experience and the
best approaches to green ecology with the United States, and the US may
be more eager to cooperate with Lithuania.]{.underline} Moreover, in
terms of geopolitics, the United States should try to defeat China's
attempts to collaborate with US allies on the same issues. On
successfully implementing and finalising those partnership activities,
further steps will be taken to proceed with cooperation. [In short, the
United States' commitment to Baltic security is part of the US
commitment to European security, and the former would not and cannot
exist without the latter]{.underline}. [As new challenges are emerging,
more efforts should be made to guarantee these commitments, thus
strengthening transatlantic ties concerns building this partnership,
reinforcing power, and preventing threats. This attitude undoubtedly
appears to be beneficial for both sides.]{.underline}

#### Baltics need more cyber defense

- Recut for civ-mil cp lol

**Veebel 17** (Viljar Veebel is a researcher and consultant who has been
researching in the University of Tartu, The Estonian School of Diplomacy
and The Tallinn Technological University. "Baltic States and Cyber
Deterrence: Taking or Losing Initiative against
Russia"https://www.fpri.org/article/2017/01/baltic-states-cyber-deterrence-taking-losing-initiative-russia/)LR

[Based on Russia's strategy in Ukraine and Georgia, elements of "cyber
warfare" will likely play an important role in future Russian conflicts.
Russia carried out similar or even more advanced attacks during the
Russian-Georgian conflict in 2008 and the Ukrainian conflict from
2013.]{.underline} In Georgia, attackers combined targeted
denial-of-service attacks (DDOS) with military action to impede
strategic communications and to create panic among civilians. [During
the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, Russia's strategy has also focused on
disinformation and psychological warfare through online media, massive
trolling on social media, and even attacks on mobile phone operators. In
contrast to their NATO counterparts, Russia's cyber and propaganda units
have shown great independence from moral considerations or legal
hesitation, using every opportunity to compromise the Baltic states and
NATO.]{.underline} Considering Russia's current ambitions in Ukraine,
the Baltic states are not likely the most important targets of Russian
cyber attacks[. However, as the "cyber war" from 2007 showed, they are
vulnerable. **If transatlantic security priorities change after Brexit
and Trump's election, the Baltic countries may come under considerable
pressure again.** From Cyber Defense to Cyber Deterrence Following its
experience in 2007, Estonia has become a pioneer in international cyber
security.]{.underline} Fortunately, contrary to military capabilities
and power games, the size of a country does not matter much here. A
cyber war's battlefield is the whole world, and quality, initiative, and
position are often more important than quantity. Waiting for the
opponent's first moves and relying only on defense does not bode well
for success. Additionally, standardized and comfortable administrative
procedures in combination with the highest possible compliance with
international law offer little advantage against an opponent using a
more flexible command model and selective approach to international law.
[The Baltic countries should strive to stay a step ahead of Russia. To
achieve this goal, they must combine the resources and the knowledge of
both the private and the public sector, guaranteeing more flexibility
when countering cyber threats**. First, cyber deterrence and cyber
defense must be re-conceptualized and distinguished from one another**.
The Baltic states all too often understand cyber defense as a passive
instrument that produces effective deterrence by itself.]{.underline}
Thus, they focus mainly on reactive and defensive measures, with the
status quo as the best possible outcome in regional cyber confrontation.
[As part of a re-conceptualization of cyber deterrence, it is also
crucial to better understand Russia in terms of its fears and
weaknesses, and a wider circle of specialists should contribute to cyber
deterrence. More awareness of Russian technological capabilities,
motives, and recent practices is also necessary. Second, the
organizational structure and procedures of cyber defense units need to
combine the best practices from the public, private, and military
sectors, each with advantages and limits.]{.underline} The command chain
must focus on results as much as possible, with automatic procedures and
flexible power delegation in critical situations. [Currently, army
practices and rules dominate the logic of decision-making and resource
distribution. However, the military rotation cycle, rank-based roles,
commitment to manuals, the tendency to avoid innovation, strong limits
for investments and procurements, and intolerance to failures do not
contribute to success in cyber conflicts.]{.underline} Speed,
flexibility, expertise, and new solutions are crucial there. [Third,
globalization and limited legal regulation of cyber security and
deterrence must be fully exploited.]{.underline} There is no need to
limit preparation and actions to traditional state boundaries,
"best-practices" of the public sector, moral considerations, and legal
hesitation[. Cyber security units can and should have cells outside NATO
territories, employ private contractors, and use unexpected retaliation
tactics. Taking these actions can create the best possible deterrence
against Russia's model of aggressive hybrid
warfare. ]{.underline}Governments must equip their cyber units with the
best possible resources in advance, and these units should have
permission to test their tactics and tools and tolerance for failure
during the development of these procedures. To start, more visible
power, initiative, and agility will help to create effective deterrence
against Russia. In practical terms, cyber defense action needs to follow
a pre-emptive mentality because if Russian forces attack first, they
might disable further defense or counterattack capabilities[. By
limiting cyber defense only to self-defense in the spirit of best moral
and legal considerations, the Baltic states and NATO in general give
Russia a comfortable zone of action. NATO voluntarily restricts itself
from efficient strategies and warfare.]{.underline} Crimea was a clear
sign for the West that in a hybrid war restricting oneself to a reactive
role and "playing a Russian game" without innovation and initiative will
lead to defeat. Baltic states have very little time and a lot to do:
[these countries and NATO should not merely focus on spending 2% of GDP
on defense, but be more specific about the capabilities required to
achieve the compulsory level of traditional and cyber deterrence. Goals,
red lines, and success markers require more clarity.]{.underline} After
Brexit in the UK, and the U.S. presidential elections, **[the Baltic
states must further develop their cyber capabilities, especially cyber
deterrence. Preserving peace may depend on it.]{.underline}**

[investment on]{.mark} **[non-kinetic]{.mark}** [capabilities with

and as recommended in "Moving Out," NATO members should purchase
additional heavy equipment transporters such as the British M1070F,
which is compliant with European regulations.91 [[Such an investment
would help]{.mark} U.S. and [NATO]{.mark} forces [arrive to the
Baltics]{.mark} **[quicker]{.mark}** in a crisis]{.underline}. Finally,
NATO members, such as Poland and Germany, should consider purchasing
flatbed railcars and even forming some type of modest rail battalion
under a NATO structure akin to what Russia utilizes. Doing so would fill
an identified shortage of rail cars across Europe and ensure their
availability in a crisis.92 Having dedicated and trained military rail
personnel to operate the trains would also enable timely and effective
movement.

The NATO goal should be to knit partners together in a networked system
of advanced command, control, communications, computers, intelligence,
surveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR), targeting, precision-guided
munitions, airborne early warning capabilities, integrated air defenses,
maritime domain awareness, undersea surveillance, and standoff
capabilities such as cruise and ballistic missiles. This networked
system-of-systems approach has come to define the contemporary
revolution in military affairs. Policy analysts James Thomas and Evan
Montgomery have dubbed these "mini A2/ AD complexes."25 [[The
**current** willingness of **key** Allies]{.underline}]{.mark} and
partners---[**[particularly]{.mark}** those [in the Baltic]{.mark}
region]{.underline}---[[to modernize their militaries makes it a
**favorable time**]{.mark} [for NATO to implement such a **defensive
concept**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Therefore, providing partners with
additional enabling capabilities to round out their defensive formations
may prove critical. To enhance area denial, NATO needs additional mobile
and survivable long-range precision-strike capabilities such as the Army
Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) and Highly Mobile Artillery Rocket
System. The Army is currently developing DeepStrike, a next-generation
missile for these systems that doubles the firepower and can engage
targets at distances up to 499 km, including the ability to hit moving
targets on land and at sea.26 To counter Russian tactical missiles,
cruise missiles, drones, and advanced aircraft, additional NATO and
partner countries should procure the Patriot and other surface-to-air
missile defense systems.

Introduction The 2020 Global Go To Think Tank Index (GGTTI) marks the
fifteenth year of continued efforts by the Think Tanks and Civil
Societies Program (TTCSP) at the University of Pennsylvania to
acknowledge the important contributions and emerging global trends of
think tanks worldwide. Our initial effort to generate a ranking of the
world's leading think tanks in 2006 was a response to a series of
requests from donors, government officials, journalists and scholars to
produce regional and international rankings of the world's preeminent
think tanks. Since its inception, our ongoing objective for the GGTTI
report is to gain an understanding of the role think tanks play in
governments and civil societies. Using this knowledge, we hope to assist
in improving the capacity and performance of think tanks around the
world.

Since 2006, the ranking process has been refined and streamlined, and
the number and scope of the institutions and individuals involved has
steadily grown. The process, as in past years, relies on a shared
definition of public policy research and analysis and engagement
organizations, a detailed set of selection criteria and an increasingly
open and transparent nomination and selection process. As part of the
nominations process, [all **11,175** think tanks catalogued in TTCSP's
Global Think Tank Database were contacted and encouraged to participate
in the nomination and ranking process]{.underline}. [Over 44,992
journalists, policymakers]{.underline}, public and private donors,
[and]{.underline} functional and regional area [specialists]{.underline}
on the TTCSP listserv [were invited to participate and]{.underline}
**[over 3,974]{.underline}** fully or partially [completed the
nomination and ranking surveys]{.underline}. Finally, a group of peers
and experts was asked to help rank and review the public policy research
Centers of Excellence for 2020.

[To refine and validate the generated ranking lists, TTCSP assembled
Expert Panels comprised of **hundreds of members**]{.underline} [from a
wide variety of backgrounds and disciplines]{.underline}. Additionally,
new media---the website and social media presence---helped us
communicate and disseminate information about criteria for this year's
Index to a wider audience (please see "Methodology and Timeline" for the
complete set of nomination and ranking criteria and "Appendices" for a
detailed explication of the ranking process). Given the rigor and scope
of the nomination and selection processes, the rankings produced thus
far have been described as the insider's guide to the global marketplace
of ideas.

As a final note, we would like to remind you that the data collection,
research and analysis for this project, as in previous years, were
conducted without the benefit of field research, a budget or staff.
Despite these limitations, [we are **confident** in the **quality** and
**integrity**]{.underline} [of the findings given the **number** of
peers and experts from around the world who have taken the time to
participate]{.underline} in the process.

We are confident that the peer nomination and selection process, as well
as the work of [the international Expert Panels]{.underline}, have
[enabled us to create the **most authoritative**]{.underline} [list of
highperformance think tanks in the world]{.underline}. Still, efforts to
streamline and perfect the process are ongoing. We are continually
seeking ways to enhance the process and welcome your comments and
suggestions. We further encourage you to provide the names and contact
information for prospective expert panelists for functional and regional
areas covered by the Index. Thank you for your continued support of
TTCSP and of the annual Global Go To Think Tank Index. We hope our
efforts to highlight the important contributions and emerging global
trends of think tanks worldwide will foster insightful discussions and
debates on the present and future roles of these vital institutions.

#### Baltic State Utility to US

**Banka 2022**, (Andris Banka , Journal of Transatlantic Studies volume
20, pages161--183 (2022), Published 4/5/2022 "Neither reckless nor
free-riders: auditing the Baltics as US treaty allies"
https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s42738-022-00096-3)

A great deal of scholarly literature has treated Baltic States' physical
proximity to Russia as their Achilles heel. The conventional wisdom
holds that due to the force imbalance in the region, which heavily
favours the Russian side, Baltic republics are hard to defend
territories.Footnote82 While this assumption is certainly valid, there
is, however, a flip side to this predicament[. Situated at a
geopolitical crossroads, these small nations are in an advantageous
position to produce valuable insights into Kremlin's statecraft. As
James Carafano suggests: "To a major power, a country's greatest asset
might be its map coordinates rather than the size of its arsenal or bank
account".Footnote83 Similarly, Brands and Feaver have noted that some of
the most valued US intelligence assets stem from allied partners
"geographical capability" and "proximity to the theater of
interest]{.underline}".Footnote84 Lacking in material power resources,
the Baltic States, within the past decade, have made a concerted effort
to set up "knowledge hubs" that excel in analysing their much larger
eastern neighbour. [Having been subjected to Russian-directed gray zone
tactics for decades, the Baltics have amassed valuable regional
expertise. Testifying before the US Committee on Foreign Affairs, a
prominent Russia-observer explained: "They \[the Baltics\] see things
that we don't see. They can go to places that we don't go. They
understand things that we don't in cyber and
intelligence".]{.underline}Footnote85 Retired Lieutenant General Ben
Hodges, who commanded the US Army Europe, concurs by emphasizing that
the Baltic republics, due to their location, "know more what is
happening in Russia, than any American will ever know".[Footnote86
Indeed, the Baltics fill in critical gaps in fields such as
cyberwarfare, intelligence gathering, and disinformation, actively
sharing this "know-how" with their US counterparts. The following
details such contributions The Republic of Estonia was the first known
victim of a state-directed cyberattack]{.underline}. The 2007 incident,
widely attributed to the Russian Federation, for weeks incapacitated
Estonian governmental structures. Somewhat paradoxically, in the long
run, the event turned out to have a positive impact as it propelled the
nation of 1.3 million people to treat the cyber domain as an intricate
part of its national security. [Subsequently, the country set up the
Tallinn-based NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence.
According to the Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid, this was a smart
way for a small country to demonstrate its contributions to
allies.Footnote87 Understanding that it has little to offer in
hard-power deliverables, Estonian leadership chose instead to focus on
the cyber domain]{.underline}. In the words of Kaljulaid's predecessor,
Toomas Ilves, the IT field served as "the great equalizer", allowing a
small nation to contribute considerably more than one "would expect by
looking at the map, population, and GDP per capita".Footnote88 [Today,
Estonia has a well-established reputation among its peers as the lead
authority for devising cybersecurity-related solutions. When it comes to
countering cyber threats, Tallinn and Washington have forged a close
bilateral relationship on various departmental levels.]{.underline} In
2020, the two governments set up a joint cyber-threat
intelligence-sharing platform.Footnote89 In addition, the US Army and
Estonia's Ministry of Defence entered into an agreement for
collaborative research on cyber defence matters.Footnote90 Such joint
initiatives have already borne fruit. In the run-up to the 2020 US
Presidential election, in order to learn more about Russian hacking
methods, the USA dispatched its cyber force operatives to
Estonia.Footnote91 For the USA, this allowed to observe the work of
Kremlin-linked agents and bolster its own election defences. Commenting
on this deployment, US Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Cyber
Policy pointed out: "Cyber is a team sport---when it comes to halting
threats from cyberspace, no one can go it alone".Footnote92 Such
operations illustrate how small states can amplify the reach of the USA
and effectively complement its capabilities. [Estonian authorities have
regularly received praise for the provision of such
services]{.underline}. James Mattis, US Secretary of Defense in the
Trump administration, upon meeting his Estonian counterpart underscored
that Washington highly appreciates Estonian leadership in this new area
of competition, and that its positive example speaks to the fact that
the size of the country does not necessarily determine its contributions
to collective security.Footnote93 In a similar vein, NATO
Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg has spoken highly of Estonia for its
efforts in training and educating NATO military staff.Footnote94 After
being the first victim of a Russian-linked cyberattack, Estonian
leadership managed to turn the incident into a certain asset. By
studying its lessons and building resilience, it gradually emerged as
the lead cyber-knowledge exporter. [For many, Russia's abilities to
effectively plant disinformation campaigns overseas came into sharper
focus during the 2016 US presidential election. For the Baltics,
however, such malign interference and attempts to sow societal divisions
were hardly anything new.]{.underline} Lawmakers in the region have been
sounding the alarm about it ever since regaining independence in the
early 1990s. [However, it was only in 2014 that Latvia opened the NATO
Centre of Excellence devoted to the exploration of such issues. Its
central analytical focus is on tracking and analysing Russia's digital
footprint.]{.underline} Since its establishment, the research
institution has produced innovative studies regarding
information-warfare efforts employed by Kremlin-linked actors and
experimental takes on societal vulnerabilities. Such analysis has often
been shared with the US government via testimonies before the US Senate
Select Committee on Intelligence and briefings with the US military
staff.Footnote95 Commenting on the centre's work, a senior US
Congressman pointed out that because of their "first-hand experience
with the Soviet Union and Putin's Russia", the Baltics have become "a
valuable source of insight" for the US government.Footnote96

[A new]{.underline} USA Today/Suffolk University [poll found eight in 10
Republicans, Democrats and independents are worried about]{.underline}
the future of American [democracy]{.underline}. But they disagree over
the causes -- and who's to blame: 85% of Democrats call the Capitol Hill
rioters "criminals"; two-thirds of Republicans believe "they went too
far but had a point".

"Only free and fair elections in which the loser abides by the result
stand between each of us and life at the mercy of a despotic regime,"
warns Harvard law professor Laurence Tribe. But increasingly, for
today's politicians, honourable defeat is a wholly foreign concept.

**[This chronic [loss of institutional trust]{.mark}]{.underline}** and
credibility, also [tainting a politicised]{.underline},
conservative-dominated [supreme court, [reflects a society]{.mark} more
[openly riven by]{.mark} longstanding [cultural]{.mark}]{.underline},
racial and religious [[animosities]{.underline}]{.mark} -- and one in
which income, wealth and health inequalities are growing. [[These
divisions are]{.mark} in turn wilfully [exacerbated by rightwing]{.mark}
broadcast and online media, bloggers and internet
**[trolls]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

A Republican party mostly in thrall to Trump's lies, delusions and
conspiracy theories is creating a world of "alternative facts", says
columnist Thomas Friedman. If they succeed in replacing truth,
"[[America]{.mark} isn't just in trouble. It [is headed for]{.mark} what
scientists call 'an **[extinction]{.mark}-level event'**".]{.underline}

Jedediah Britton-Purdy, a Columbia law professor, is similarly
apocalyptic. "[One thing Democrats and Republicans share is the belief
that, to save the country, the other side must not be allowed to win ...
**[Every election is an existential crisis]{.mark}**,"]{.underline} he
wrote.

"We should stop underestimating the threat facing the country," a grim
New York Times editorial thundered last week. "**[[January 6]{.mark} is
not in the past; it [is every day]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. [It is
regular citizens who threaten election officials]{.underline}]{.mark}[,
who ask 'when can we use the guns?', who vow to murder politicians who
dare to vote their conscience.]{.underline} It is Republican lawmakers
scrambling to make it harder for people to vote and subvert their will
if they do. It is Trump who stokes the flames of conflict."
[Democracy]{.underline}, it said, [was in "grave danger]{.underline}".

Systemic violence that overwhelms conventional politics may be near at
hand. "**[[We are closer to civil war than any of us would like to
believe]{.underline}]{.mark}**," says Barbara Walter, a California
politics professor.

No one is talking about a remake of the 1861-65 US civil war. Instead,
as in Ukraine or Libya, [an "open insurgency",]{.underline} as defined
by Walter, [would]{.underline} probably [involve]{.underline} (at least
initially), [disparate militias and their supporters pursuing forms of
asymmetrical warfare -- typically terrorist acts, bombings,
assassinations, kidnappings.]{.underline} That said, worrying echoes of
Confederate-era secessionism are once again heard in Texas and
elsewhere.

When the warlike rhetoric of Charlottesville-style paramilitary [white
supremacists]{.underline}, the high nationwide incidence of [gun
ownership and]{.underline}, for example, worries about [**[far-right
cells within the]{.mark} US [military]{.mark}** are factored in, [civil
war scenarios do not appear]{.mark} so
[implausible]{.mark}.]{.underline}

"**[[Only a spark is needed, one major domestic terrorist event that
shifts the perception of the country]{.underline}]{.mark}**," analyst
Stephen Marche wrote last week. [[Marche quotes a **military history
professor**]{.mark} and Iraq war veteran, Col Peter Mansoor, who tells
him: "It would not be like the first civil war, with armies manoeuvring
on the battlefield. I think [it would]{.mark} very much [be a
free-for-all]{.mark}, neighbour on neighbour, [based on beliefs and skin
colours]{.mark} and religion. And it would be horrific."]{.underline}

### China

#### retag\-\--5G cyber is the new battlefield, mutual cooperation between US-NATO with the Baltics key to combat China and Russia

**Wierenga 22** (Louis Wierenga Junior Research Fellow, Johan Skytte
Institute of Political Studies, University of Tartu \| Lecturer in
International Relations, Department of Political and Strategic Studies,
Baltic Defence College. "Cybersecurity and Hybrid Threats in the Digital
Baltic states: A state of the art",
https://www.baltdefcol.org/files/files/publications/Hybrid%20Threats_LIIA.pdf)LR

[In light of power competition vis-à-vis cooperation with the US,
NATO,]{.underline} and the EU, [and small states standing up to larger
powers with **nefarious intentions,**]{.underline} the drawback is that
no entity is capable of defeating all cyberattacks; rather, in order to
succeed in cyberspace**[, the key is learning how to adequately
*[cope.]{.mark}*]{.underline}**24 [When it comes to information warfare,
and one of the reasons for which it is so dangerous, is that the
antagonist need not win -- they succeed if they are able to successfully
cloud the issue.]{.underline}25 [It is no secret that **Russia has
waged** **numerous information warfare campaigns in the Baltics** and
show **no sign of giving up.** **Recommendations and policy
developments**]{.underline} Keep on the cusp of cyber hygiene and widely
promote amongst citizens: General H.R. McMaster notes [the importance of
American efforts to conduct reconnaissance in cyberspace and preempt
attacks]{.underline}.26 S[trive to continuously be one step ahead of
hackers. Although this is a daunting, if not (nearly) impossible task,
it is one which would involve both governments and the general
public.]{.underline} One aspect which has greatly contributed to [the
success of Estonia in becoming a world leader in cyber defence is
investing in people.]{.underline}27 Promoting cyber hygiene is one
aspect at which Estonia excels. Raising further awareness about media
literacy to combat disinformation and misinformation also helps to win
the battle against information warfare. [McMaster also **advocates for
the US to learn from countries** which were on the receiving end of
Russian aggression]{.underline}.28 As one of the strengths which Estonia
possesses is its investment in people, Estonia is a success story in
cyber and IT education and training, ranging from kindergarteners to the
elderly.29 [In an increasingly multipolar world order**, the rise of
China presents a serious security challenge** to Europe and the
Transatlantic alliance and can be seen on a number of
fronts.]{.underline} [One of the most pressing, especially when it comes
to cybersecurity, is 5G. If seen through the lens of 'the West', then a
united front should consist of the US and NATO, plus PfP
countries,]{.underline} along with the EU in cyber policy. [When it
comes to 5G, this is especially important. The Baltic states have taken
strides to become leaders in 5G policy and can use this opportunity to
take a leading role in a Western front in the battlegrounds for 5G
policy]{.underline}. [Keeping focus on **both China and Russia as
threats to the security of NATO**]{.underline} and the EU: For valid
reasons -- both historical and contemporary -- the Russian Federation is
identified as the primary security threat to the 3 Baltic states. The
most contemporary events in the neighborhood do not indicate any change
in the consistency or persistence of the threat, nor its digital nature.
[Cyber and hybrid threats directed towards the Baltic states from the
Russian Federation will not cease and military, government, and civilian
entities need to continue with vigilance, adapt to the rapidly changing
nature of cybersecurity and cyberwar, as well as anticipate future
changes, staying ahead of the curve.]{.underline} However, despite the
very valid concerns over Russian cyber activity, the [Baltic states
should not neglect such concerns as they relate to China. Indeed, as
aforementioned, the Baltic states, especially Lithuania, have taken a
firm stance towards China,]{.underline} [in cyberspace and
beyond,]{.underline} and should continue to use their growing digital
prowess to expand their influence in the EU and NATO. Lithuania, under
the leadership of Foreign Minister Gabrielius 63 Landsbergis, has
increasingly stood up to China.30 Minister Landsbergis's stance towards
China led to him being named as one of Politico's 'most influential
people in Europe' -- and the only one to make the list from any of the
Baltic states.31 [Latvia has called upon China to respect the rules of
international cyberspace.32 It should be noted that this is certainly
not the first time that leaders from the Baltic states have appeared on
similar lists]{.underline}, granting small states representation on
lists where the usual larger powers within Europe enjoy substantial
representation. Such leadership should be emulated, and the digital
advances made by the Baltic states provides an ideal way to achieve
this, as many countries look to the Baltics as digital leaders.
Demonstrating leadership to allies: If ever there was a time, as well as
a concrete area for the Baltic states to showcase their strengths as
small states, demonstrating leadership in the cyber and tech fields
presents the perfect opportunity. [Estonia has been the Baltic champion
for cybersecurity and e-governance. Lithuania, and to a lesser extent
Latvia have shown signs of catching up. Much like offline matters, the
three Baltic states use opportunities to meet with US]{.underline} and
EU [leaders to highlight the dire security situation which the
Transatlantic alliance faces from a resurgent Russia]{.underline} --
they know from experience and contemporary matters. As the security of
cyberspace is one of the acute questions of global politics this
century33, cybersecurity and matters of digital warfare will be issues
which merit pressing resolve, which is constantly changing. Being on the
cutting edge will require countries to remain that way. While member of
the United Nations Security Council for the first time, Estonia made
cybersecurity a priority, along with the overall security of the
region.34 As well, when a member of the UN Security Council, Estonia
made it a point to align with the US and the UK to call Russia out over
a cyberattack directed at Georgia.35 Latvia and Lithuania have also been
active on such fronts. In 2021, Latvia signed an agreement with Poland
which establishes a framework for cooperation between Latvia's Military
Information Technology Security 64 Incident Team (MilCERT) and Poland's
National Cyber Security Center.36 Latvia is also taking the opportunity
to reach out to the United States to discuss cybersecurity in the
region.37 Lithuania has, as aforementioned, developed their own cyber
center the RCDC, which is a bilateral LithuanianUS initiative.38
Conclusion To conclude[, the domain of cyberspace will be an arena for
battle for the foreseeable future. All countries, governments,
militaries will be faced with such threats, and the likelihood of
businesses and private individuals being faced with such threats is
high.]{.underline} The Baltic states are no strangers to such threats
and have been leaders in facing up to them. Given the nature of threats
faced and the manner in which the Baltics have faced up to them, [it is
safe to say that the Baltic states will continue to rise up to the
challenges and keep up with the rapidly changing nature of cyber
threats. However, the last point is the most persisting challenge any
entity faces in cyberspace -- the need to not only consistently keep up
but remain steps ahead of adversaries. The bi- and multilateral
agreements made as well as the leadership demonstrated, and the digital
awareness can go a long way to not only meet contemporary and future
challenges but serve as examples and demonstrate
leadership.]{.underline} Cyber and hybrid threats are ominous, but on a
positive note, the Baltic states have achieved many remarkable
accomplishments in this field.

#### Taiwan-Lithuania cooperation key to defend against Chinese cyberattacks

[The establishment of a representative office in Lithuania constitutes a
victory for Taiwan in its efforts to counter both international
isolation and the Chinese narrative of Taiwan's supposedly inevitable
international isolation.]{.underline} By focusing on a part of the world
that has not traditionally been an area for Taiwanese presence and
engagement, Taipei has also demonstrated the virtues of an asymmetrical
approach to combating China on the world stage. [This development also
exposes the fact that Beijing is willing to break its own rules on "One
China," in that it is now willing to punish states even when they
continue to abide by their "One-China Policy" by not establishing
official ties with Taiwan.]{.underline} Although the object of Beijing's
ire is ostensibly related to the nomenclature used for Taiwan's office
in Vilnius (which uses the word "Taiwan"), at a deeper level, the source
of its anger is the gains that Taiwan has made in Europe, an area where
China had hoped to increase its influence. Lithuania has taken some
risks in placing its bets on Taiwan, and besides the retaliation it is
currently facing, the move may also have cost it future economic
opportunities. [Consequently, it will be crucial for Taiwan to
demonstrate that Vilnius' risk-taking was not in vain. Already, a large
Taiwanese trade and investment delegation has visited the country, with
a total of 240 online and offline trade talks involving more than 150
Lithuanian firms and various Taiwanese ones.]{.underline} Taiwan must
build on the complementarity of the two economies to replicate its
successes in countries like the Czech Republic, where despite much
Chinese propaganda, [Taiwan has been a much more substantial investor
and job creator. Lithuania has a hard-working, highly educated and
productive workforce in the manufacturing sector, with strengths in
areas such as the laser industry---which has also become a target for
Chinese retaliation, with China deciding to halt cooperation between its
laser industry bodies and Lithuania.]{.underline} Trade forms the basis
of bilateral relations and must be mutually beneficial. Lithuania has
made it clear that it expects to reap the benefits of engagement with
Taiwan, a country with an economy approximately 11 times larger than its
own, as well as a highly advanced tech sector. Lithuania therefore
represents a golden opportunity for Taiwan to showcase the advantages of
engagement and to demonstrate that small and medium states not only can
afford to defy China but can actually benefit materially from doing so.
[Conversely, failure to build upon and to sustain this momentum could
dissuade prospective partners from going down that path. Thus, Taipei
must demonstrate a commitment to building prosperous and mutually
beneficial ties with its new Baltic ally,]{.underline} and the [tangible
results must materialize as expeditiously as possible]{.underline}. [The
potential for engagement between Taiwan and the Baltics goes well beyond
trade and investment, however. Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia all have
traditions of resistance to external aggression and, by virtue of their
proximity to Russia,]{.underline} [have developed their own strategies
to counter the security threat posed by their much more powerful -- and
like China, expansionist neighbor. **Taiwan and the Baltic states,**
therefore, **have much to learn from each other**, in areas **ranging
from cyber and hybrid warfare to the implementation of an asymmetrical
defense posture.** While Russia poses the more immediate threat to the
Baltic region underscored by apprehensions across the region that Moscow
could launch an invasion of Ukraine as early as next January -- it is
also clear that China has become a more active player in the region,
with all the risks of espionage, cyberattacks, co-optation, and hybrid
threats that this new presence entails. Countries like Lithuania that
have already defied Beijing are now bracing for the very real
possibility of cyberattacks against their institutions]{.underline}, and
this is an area where Taiwan's expertise in addressing such threats can
come in handy. [**Appropriate intelligence-sharing mechanisms** must
therefore be established to facilitate communication, threat mitigation,
and response; these are areas where, again, Baltic states can make real
gains from a deeper relationship with Taiwan, whose capabilities in the
cyber sector are larger by orders of magnitude.]{.underline} The
fledgling relationship with this part of Europe also creates
opportunities for Taiwan's indigenous defense industry, particularly in
the unmanned vehicle sector: for example, Taiwan donated 10 police
drones to Lithuania in October to assist the country as it deals with an
influx of refugees from Belarus. For its part, [Taiwan has much to learn
from the Baltic states in non-traditional military areas, particularly
in areas of state resilience and the concept of total
defense.]{.underline} For example, as it explores ways by which to
increase its deterrence against a Chinese attack, [the Taiwanese
military could learn important lessons from the Lithuanian Lietuvos
Šaulių Sąjunga ("Riflemen's Union"), the Estonian Defense League, and
the National Guard, initiatives that blend traditional military forces
with a militia and civilian component.]{.underline} Among other things,
Taiwan could learn from those countries' experiences in providing
training to these additional layers of defense, as well as how and where
to safely store weapons so that they can be quickly accessed by
paramilitary forces in times of national emergency. No doubt Taiwan
could learn a thing or two about forming and training a proper Reserve
Force. Taiwan and the Baltics can also identify areas for the joint
training of special forces and other units charged with waging
asymmetrical war against a much more powerful and better-equipped
opponent[. Latvia and Lithuania, in particular, have clearly signaled
their willingness to engage Taiwan more closely on such matters. For
this to happen, the Taiwanese government will have to be willing to go
beyond its traditional areas of engagement on security issues, and
civilian authorities will have to contend with a culture of historical
resistance within the ministry of national defense to the idea of giving
the population a role in national security]{.underline} (especially one
that involves arming them). But as with trade, Taipei will need to
overcome those difficulties and, as rapidly as possible, demonstrate to
its potential partners that it is ready to engage them in a way that is
mutually beneficial. As the experience with Lithuania shows, an
unprecedented window of opportunity has been created for Taiwan in the
Baltics -one that will not remain open indefinitely. While we cannot
expect results overnight, especially on security matters, [Taipei cannot
afford to drag its feet -- and must therefore be proactive in its
efforts to turn this potential into a source of real benefits for all
the countries involved. It has natural and willing partners in the
Baltics; Taipei, too, must demonstrate that it means what it
says.]{.underline} If it does well in that area, there is a high
likelihood that countries elsewhere will take notice. Failure to seize
this moment, however, could have long-term detrimental effects on
Taiwan's appeal, and thereby strengthen China's ability to deter
engagement with Taiwan. The ball, therefore, is very much in Taipei's
court. The main point: A window of opportunity has opened for Taiwan to
deepen its engagement with the Baltic states, a grouping of small
nations that also faces an existential threat from a powerful
authoritarian neighbor. In areas ranging from trade to non-traditional
defense, these states are natural allies for Taiwan, and provide a
chance for Taipei to showcase the real benefits of closer ties despite
threatened retaliation by Beijing.

[Adding to the worry, over the past five years China has steadily
increased its pressure on Taiwan, reducing the number of mainland
tourists who can visit the island, stripping away its few remaining
diplomatic partners, placing an embargo on certain Taiwanese exports,
ramping up military activities in its vicinity, conducting
cyber-attacks, and interfering in Taiwan s democratic
process.]{.underline} While Xi continues to publicly stress his
commitment to peaceful reunification" with Taiwan and has not introduced
an explicit timeline for achieving this objective, he has also said that
the Taiwan issue cannot be passed on from generation to generation."2 He
has set 2049 as the date by which China must achieve the great
rejuvenation of the Chinese nation," and achieving reunification" with
Taiwan is a core condition for that project.3 [Still, it remains
unlikely that Xi has already decided to use force against Taiwan, which
provides an opening for the United States to adjust its policies and
work with its allies to help prevent such an outcome. Although there is
debate over whether China will resort to force, China is clearly
developing capabilities needed to invade and occupy Taiwan.]{.underline}
Preparing for a conflict over Taiwan has driven China s military
modernization campaign for the past two and a half decades. [China has
invested significant resources in developing the tools to defeat Taiwan
and prevent the United States from coming to its aid, principally an
arsenal of accurate ballistic missiles, the world's largest navy,
hundreds of modern fighter aircraft and bombers, and advanced cyber and
counterspace assets]{.underline} The recommendations proposed, while
ambitious, are feasible in the current political climate in both
Washington and Tokyo, and, with sustained focus in both capitals, can be
implemented in the next five years. [While China has a number of options
it could take to put pressure on Taiwan---seizing an offshore island,
**initiating massive cyberattacks**, firing hundreds of ballistic
missiles to take out critical infrastructure, and conducting a
quarantine of the island]{.underline}---this paper focuses squarely on
how to deter and respond to an invasion of Taiwan. It does so in the
belief that Japan s appetite for assisting the United States in
countering Chinese aggression against Taiwan short of a full war is
politically challenging and likely limited[. China is not relying on its
inherent advantages, however, and has instead spent the last two and a
half decades developing capabilities designed to neutralize U.S. power
in the Taiwan Strait.]{.underline} Its military budget has grown from
\$14.3 billion in 1996 to \$252.3 billion in 2020, a nearly eighteenfold
increase (see figure 2).7 [Preparing for a conflict over Taiwan has
consistently driven Beijing s procurement decisions, and China can now
bring significant capabilities to bear.]{.underline} The PLA Navy (PLAN)
is now the largest navy in the world (as measured by the number of
ships, although the United States continues to exceed it by tonnage),
with 355 ships and submarines, and is set to grow by nearly 100 ships by
the end of the decade.8 The PLA Air Force is the largest air force in
the region and is rapidly catching up to Western air forces" and eroding
U.S. advantages, according to the U.S. Department of Defense.9 The PLA
has one thousand short-range ballistic missiles and six hundred
medium-range ballistic missiles in its arsenal.10 [China has also
established an advanced integrated air defense system on its east coast
that can cover Taiwan.]{.underline}11 [The PLA is now turning its
attention to addressing previous gaps that have persisted, such as
anti-submarine warfare, while also rapidly developing information,
cyber, and space and counterspace capabilities.]{.underline}12 Taiwan,
however, is belatedly recognizing the need to dramatically rethink and
invest in its defense. In 2017, its military leadership introduced the
Overall Defense Concept(ODC), which aims to develop asymmetric
approaches to fend off a Chinese invasion and calls for investing in a
large number of smaller, cheaper, and more mobile weapons.23 Rather than
seeking to defeat the PLA through attrition, ODC focuses on a decisive
fight near Taiwans shores and the prevention of a successful PLA
landing. Taiwan has steadily increased its defense budget in recent
years, which is now the highest it has ever been in absolute terms.24
More important is using these funds to resource an asymmetric strategy,
purchasing missiles, drones, and howitzers.25 There remain obstacles to
ODC s implementation, however, and more traditional thinking could well
make a comeback.26 All of this means that U.S. intervention on Taiwan s
behalf would be a risky and costly proposition, as China can now
challenge the United States across all domains and place U.S. aircraft,
surface vessels (including aircraft carriers), and bases throughout the
Indo-Pacific at risk. [In addition, the United States would for the
first time be fighting a nuclear-armed opponent with precision standoff
weapons, extensive cyberwarfare capabilities, and the ability to target
its satellites.27]{.underline}

[Russia's invasion of Ukraine has raised the specter of nuclear
war]{.underline}, as Russian President Vladimir Putin has placed his
nuclear forces at an elevated state of alert and has warned that any
effort by outside parties to interfere in the war would result in
"consequences you have never seen." [Such saber-rattling has
understandably made headlines and drawn notice in Washington. But if
China attempted to forcibly invade Taiwan]{.underline} and the United
States came to Taipei's aid, [the **threat of escalation could
outstrip** even the current nerve-wracking situation in
Europe]{.underline}. A recent war game, conducted by the Center for a
New American Security in conjunction with the NBC program "Meet the
Press," demonstrated just how quickly such a conflict could escalate.
The game posited a fictional crisis set in 2027, with the aim of
examining how the United States and China might act under a certain set
of conditions. The game demonstrated that [China's military
modernization and expansion of its nuclear arsenal]{.underline}---not to
mention the importance Beijing places on unification with Taiwan---[mean
that, in the real world, a fight between China and the United States
could very well go nuclear]{.underline}. [Beijing views Taiwan as a
breakaway republic. If the Chinese Communist Party decides to invade the
island, its leaders may not be able to accept failure]{.underline}
without seriously harming the regime's legitimacy. [Thus, the CCP might
be willing to take significant risks to ensure that the conflict ends on
terms that it finds acceptable]{.underline}. That would mean convincing
the United States and its allies that the costs of defending Taiwan are
so high that it is not worth contesting the invasion. While China has
several ways to achieve that goal, [from Beijing's perspective, using
nuclear weapons may be the most effective]{.underline} means to keep the
United States out of the conflict. China is several decades into
transforming its People's Liberation Army (PLA) into what the Chinese
President Xi Jinping has called a "world-class military" that could
defeat any third party that comes to Taiwan's defense. China's
warfighting strategy, known as "anti-access/area denial," rests on being
able to project conventional military power out several thousand miles
in order to prevent the American military, in particular, from
effectively countering a Chinese attack on Taiwan. Meanwhile, [a growing
nuclear arsenal provides Beijing with coercive leverage as well as
potentially new warfighting capabilities, which could increase the risks
of war and escalation]{.underline}. China has historically possessed
only a few hundred ground-based nuclear weapons. But last year, nuclear
scholars at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies and the
Federation of American Scientists identified three missile silo fields
under construction in the Xinjiang region. The Financial Times reported
that China might have carried out tests of hypersonic gliders as a part
of an orbital bombardment system that could evade missile defenses and
deliver nuclear weapons to targets in the continental United States. The
U.S. Department of Defense projects that by 2030, China will have around
1,000 deliverable warheads---more than triple the number it currently
possesses. Based on these projections, Chinese leaders may believe that
as early as five years from now the PLA will have made enough
conventional and nuclear gains that it could fight and win a war to
unify with Taiwan. [Our recent war game]{.underline}---in which members
of Congress, former government officials, and subject matter experts
assumed the roles of senior national security decision makers in China
and the United States---[illustrated that a U.S.-Chinese war could
escalate quickly]{.underline}. For one thing, it showed that [both
countries would face operational incentives to strike military forces on
the other's territory]{.underline}. In the game, such strikes were
intended to be calibrated to avoid escalation; both sides tried to walk
a fine line by attacking only military targets. But [such attacks
crossed red lines for both countries, and produced a **tit-for-tat cycle
of attacks that broadened the scope and intensity of the
conflict**]{.underline}. For instance, in the simulation, China launched
a preemptive attack against key U.S. bases in the Indo-Pacific region.
The attacks targeted Guam, in particular, because it is a forward
operating base critical to U.S. military operations in Asia, and because
since it is a territory, and not a U.S. state, the Chinese team viewed
striking it as less escalatory than attacking other possible targets. In
response, the United States targeted Chinese military ships in ports and
surrounding facilities, but refrained from other attacks on the Chinese
mainland. Nevertheless, both sides perceived these strikes as attacks on
their home territory, crossing an important threshold. Instead of
mirror-imaging their own concerns about attacks on their territory, each
side justified the initial blows as military necessities that were
limited in nature and would be seen by the other as such. Responses to
the initial strikes only escalated things further as the U.S. team
responded to China's moves by hitting targets in mainland China, and the
Chinese team responded to Washington's strikes by attacking sites in
Hawaii. A NEW ERA One particularly alarming finding from the war game is
that China found it necessary to threaten to go nuclear from the start
in order to ward off outside support for Taiwan. This threat was
repeated throughout the game, particularly after mainland China had been
attacked. At times, efforts to erode Washington's will so that it would
back down from the fight received greater attention by the China team
than the invasion of Taiwan itself. But China had difficulty convincing
the United States that its nuclear threats were credible. In real life,
China's significant and recent changes to its nuclear posture and
readiness may impact other nations' views, as its nuclear threats may
not be viewed as credible given its stated doctrine of no first use, its
smaller but burgeoning nuclear arsenal, and lack of experience making
nuclear threats. This may push China to preemptively detonate a nuclear
weapon to reinforce the credibility of its warning. [China might also
resort to a demonstration of its nuclear might because of constraints on
its long-range conventional strike capabilities]{.underline}. Five years
from now, the PLA still will have a very limited ability to launch
conventional attacks beyond locations in the "second island chain" in
the Pacific; namely, Guam and Palau. Unable to strike the U.S. homeland
with conventional weapons, China would struggle to impose costs on the
American people. Up until a certain point in the game, the U.S. team
felt its larger nuclear arsenal was sufficient to deter escalation and
did not fully appreciate the seriousness of China's threats. As a
result, China felt it needed to escalate significantly to send a message
that the U.S. homeland could be at risk if Washington did not back down.
Despite China's stated "no-first use" nuclear policy, the war game
resulted in Beijing detonating a nuclear weapon off the coast of Hawaii
as a demonstration. The attack caused relatively little destruction, as
the electromagnetic pulse only damaged the electronics of ships in the
immediate vicinity but did not directly impact the U.S. state. The war
game ended before the U.S. team could respond, but it is likely that the
first use of a nuclear weapon since World War II would have provoked a
response. The most likely paths to nuclear escalation in a fight between
the United States and China are different from those that were most
likely during the Cold War. The Soviet Union and the United States
feared a massive, bolt-from-the-blue nuclear attack, which would
precipitate a full-scale strategic exchange. In a confrontation over
Taiwan, however, Beijing could employ nuclear weapons in a more limited
way to signal resolve or to improve its chances of winning on the
battlefield. It is unclear how a war would proceed after that kind of
limited nuclear use and whether the United States could de-escalate the
situation while still achieving its objectives. AN OUNCE OF PREVENTION
[The clear lesson from the war game is that the United States needs to
**strengthen**]{.underline} its [**conventional capabilities** in the
Indo-Pacific to ensure that China **never views an invasion of Taiwan as
a prudent tactical move**]{.underline}. To do so, the United States will
need to commit to maintaining its conventional military superiority by
expanding its stockpiles of long-range munitions and investing in
undersea capabilities. Washington must also be able to conduct offensive
operations inside the first and second island chains even while under
attack. This will require access to new bases to distribute U.S. forces,
enhance their survivability, and ensure that they can effectively defend
Taiwan in the face of China's attacks. Moreover, [the United States
needs to]{.underline} develop an integrated network of partners willing
to **[contribute to Taiwan's defense]{.underline}**. Allies are an
asymmetric advantage: the United States has them, and China does not.
[The United States should **deepen strategic and operational planning**
with key partners to **send a strong signal of resolve** to
China]{.underline}. As part of these planning efforts, the United States
and its allies will need to develop war-winning military strategies that
do not cross Chinese red-lines. The game highlighted just how difficult
this task may be; what it did not highlight is the complexity of
developing military strategies that integrate the strategic objectives
and military capacities of multiple nations. Moving forward, military
planners in the United States and in Washington's allies and partners
must grapple with the fact that, in a conflict over Taiwan, China would
consider all conventional and nuclear options to be on the table. And
[the United States is **running out of time** to strengthen deterrence
and keep China from believing an invasion of Taiwan could be successful.
**The biggest risk** is that Washington and its friends choose not to
seize the moment and act: **a year or two from now**, it might already
be too late]{.underline}.

Estonia\'s digital revolution [In Estonia, where Russia launched one of
the earliest destructive cyberattacks in 2007, things are even more
serious. After Estonia gained independence from the former Soviet Union
in 1991, its leaders pushed for a digital revolution, and today, almost
all government and private services are online. During the cyber drills,
teams were responsible for protecting those critical services, which
were under constant attack. They were tasked with keeping the power grid
running, responding to disinformation and propaganda over social media,
and protecting a new 5G substation.]{.underline} Lauri Almann,

had to prevent any interference with a financial communication system
similar to SWIFT, which allows for secure financial transactions between
international banks. Russian banks have recently been banned from SWIFT
in light of Russia\'s invasion. Finally, the exercise included defending
remote work environments, an addition inspired by cybersecurity threats
emerging from the Covid-19 pandemic.]{.underline} A hotel room as
battleground During a tour of the exercise war room at a hotel in
Tallinn, organizers from different teams told NPR about the different
challenges the teams face. Beyond the technical, that also includes
answering legal questions and responding to media requests, making
strategic and political decisions, identifying and isolating digital
threats as they were launched, and even working with other teams in case
of an emergency, like connecting a failing power grid to a neighboring
region to keep it online. The name of the exercise, Locked Shields, is
inspired by the military concept of linking defenses and working
together, explained exercise director Carry Kangur. Locked Shield
Excercise at Hilton Tallinn Park. Nora Lorek for NPR Mehis Hakkaja, the
founder and CEO of cybersecurity company Clarified Security, was the
leader of the red team, or the attackers. He said his team\'s strategy
was to launch distracting, unsophisticated attacks early in the
exercise, like website defacements. Then they would slowly burrow their
way into a team\'s office computers and infiltrate the rest of the
network. That strategy is a mirror of what happens in the real world.
For example, as Russia was launching early cyberattacks during the
ongoing war in Ukraine, unsophisticated denial of service attacks on
government websites drew attention while Russia was actually launching
more destructive and subtle attacks, including deploying wiper malware
on satellite servers and other Ukrainian government devices to render
them inoperable. Fake targets, real malware The targets in the exercise,
like the Berylia Institute of Virology, are fake, but the technology and
the malware used to attack it are real. Some of the technology was
donated by companies like Siemens, manufacturers of industrial
infrastructure. Urmas Ruuto, the Chief of the Technology Branch at the
NATO Cyber Center, helped design the game\'s systems. He showed
reporters large screens representing the power grid in Berylia, the
water purification system, voice over IP servers representing the phone
lines, satellite communications channels, and a financial messaging
system. It\'s easy to track how teams are doing. Siim Marvek, cyber
conscript at CR14 Cyber Range. His uniform is made from pixels of photos

there is trouble,\" said Ruuto. And if a team fails to protect its
region from an attack on the power grid that would cause physical
destruction in real life, the organizers will set off real firecrackers
to represent the damage. For the first time this year, teams have to
defend a new 5G substation, cutting edge technology that\'s caused
controversy over recent years due to the Chinese company Huawei\'s
ambitions to develop and monopolize its release. Currently, most phone
companies claim to have released 5G, but are actually offering 4G with
additional bandwidth, Ruuto explained. Additionally, teams faced a wider
range of social media influence campaigns. In the war room, organizers
in Tallinn had a green screen to film TikTok style videos at any point
in the exercise, responding to teams as they posted their own messages.

Estonia, a small nation on Russia\'s border, people are still
conscripted into military training. Marvet is a cyber conscript, meaning
he applied to do his military training with the cyber units, who not
only work on computers but are trained in wilderness survival, which
includes testing technology in the woods to make sure it would function
during a potential conflict. Adrian Venables, the mastermind behind the
plot of the cyberwar drill, explained that the scenario focused on
disputes between the two imaginary islands and groups of smaller
surrounding islands, as well as tensions between minority populations.
He told NPR that he had no lack of real-world inspiration when drafting
the story teams would engage with. He said he is already working on both
the next exercise to take place in Estonia, an offensive cybersecurity
drill called Crossed Swords, and next year\'s Locked
Shields.]{.underline} The exercise \"has been in the works for a year,\"
explained Col. Jaak Tarien, the director of the NATO Cyber Center,
during a briefing. \"But the war in Ukraine has been going on since
2014. Russia has been attacking the power grid,\" for example, he said.
Ukrainian businesses were also the target of a destructive attack later
called NotPetya, which ultimately got loose and damaged companies around
the world, costing billions of dollars in damages. The war unites
hackers in the \'free world\' The exercise organizers told NPR they were
not surprised by Russia\'s ongoing digital attacks on Ukraine, though
Col. Tarien said he was impressed by how Russia\'s invasion \"has united
hackers in the free world,\" referring to how hacktivists from around
the world have joined forces with a new Ukrainian volunteer hacker army
to target Russia. \"It\'s quite unique,\" he said. Tarien also said
Ukraine has been surprising Russia, both in its military defenses and
its ability to fend off cyberattacks. According to Taurien, he still
frequently communicates with his colleagues in Ukraine. \"When I\'m
sending emails to them, they are coming back.\" The text Killnet Hacked

professionals from Ukraine partnered with a team from the United States
to participate in the exercise. After some earlier resistance, Ukraine
was recently invited to be a contributing member of the NATO Cyber
Center, particularly given the valuable intelligence about Russian
cyberattacks Ukrainian experts can provide. [When the exercise
concluded, a Finnish team won, earning the most points in both technical
defending and strategic decision making. In Estonia, the target of one
of the first major nation-on-nation cyberattacks from Russia, experts
and average people alike recognize that digital attacks are a part of
Russia\'s strategy. While cyberattacks haven\'t been as destructive as
many expected in the war on Ukraine, Estonian officials warn that the
threat has not been eliminated. \"The fact of the matter is that the
almighty cyber power of Russia did not roll out,\" Permanent Secretary
Kusti Salm, the highest civilian defense official in Estonia, told NPR.
\"But clearly it would be extremely false to draw a conclusion that they
are not capable.\"]{.underline}

bipartisan U.S.-China bill",

**[McConnell gets GOP backup in his move to snarl bipartisan U.S.-China
bill. Senate Republicans are lining up to back Minority Leader Mitch
McConnell as he threatens to tank multi-billion-dollar legislation aimed
at confronting China, imperiling what initially appeared on track to
join this Congress' biggest bipartisan achievements]{.underline}**.
McConnell's threat, sent via tweet while senators were away from
Washington, was aimed at derailing Democrats' fledgling efforts to
revive their party-line tax and climate bill, which all Republicans are
expected to oppose[. Although the Kentucky Republican supported the
U.S.-China competition bill, known by some as USICA, he's now vowing to
block it if Democrats move forward with their separate
legislation.]{.underline} The move jostled lawmakers from both parties.
But even Republicans who toiled on the now-at-risk competitiveness bill
are behind him[. "USICA is a national security imperative," said Sen.
John Cornyn (R-Texas), whose effort to spur microchip production is
included in the legislation. "I interpreted that as Sen. McConnell's
firm indication that he wants us to deal with that and not a partisan
reconciliation bill." Top Democrats say they are unrattled by a
McConnell maneuver widely viewed as a last-ditch effort to sink a
party-line spending bill that could help them dismantle much of the
GOP's 2017 tax cuts. Moving forward with the tax and climate bill as
they brush off McConnell's posture, Democrats insist the GOP leader has
little leverage over their cross-Capitol talks.]{.underline} After three
months, negotiators from both parties and both chambers are still
finalizing a China competition bill that bridges differences between the
House- and Senate-passed versions. The Senate passed its version more
than a year ago, with nearly every Democrat and 19 Republicans voting
yes. [Democrats insist that Republicans who previously backed USICA
wouldn't suddenly oppose it simply because they're pursuing priorities
they've gone after since they took power on the Hill. But if their bet
goes sour, some Democrats privately acknowledge they have at least one
plan B, even if they're not prepared to use it yet: Ditching cross-aisle
bicameral talks altogether and sending the Senate-approved version
through the House. On Monday, McConnell argued that a party-line
spending bill will "crowd out" the Senate's ability to pass USICA and
"paralyze" the chamber. Cornyn indicated that he wasn't particularly
worried about USICA going by the wayside, citing Democrats' months-long
failure to reach an agreement on their unilateral spending
bill]{.underline} --- though majority-party senators involved in the
talks are hinting at progress in the latest round of talks. Democrats
say it shouldn't be a zero-sum choice between two substantively
different bills. [They point to McConnell's own insistence that last
year's bipartisan infrastructure bill proceed separately from an
earlier, \$1.7 trillion version of this summer's party-line spending
plan. "The right question is how ridiculous is it to kill a bill that
you say you like because there's a different negotiation about a
different thing," Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) said. "There's just no
way you can govern that way." Even before McConnell's tweet, a growing
number of battleground-district House Democrats had been pressuring
party leaders to simply take up the Senate version, eager to tout the
bipartisan victory back home and anxious that talks could break down
fully before November.]{.underline}

[Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) told Democratic leaders Thursday **he
would not support an economic package this month** that contains new
spending on climate change or new tax increases targeting wealthy
individuals and corporations, **marking a massive setback for party
lawmakers who had hoped to advance a central element of their agenda
before the midterm elections this fall**]{.underline}. [The major shift
in negotiations --- confirmed by two people familiar with the matter who
spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the talks --- threatened
to upend the delicate process to adopt the party's signature economic
package seven months after Manchin scuttled the original, roughly \$2
trillion Build Back Better Act, which President Biden had
endorsed.]{.underline} But Manchin told Democratic leaders he is open to
provisions that aim to lower prescription drug costs for seniors, the
two people said. And the West Virginia moderate expressed support with
Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), the party's chief
negotiator, for extending subsidies that could help keep health
insurance costs down for millions of Americans, one of the sources said.
"[Political headlines are of no value to the millions of Americans
struggling to afford groceries and gas as inflation soars to 9.1
percent," said Sam Runyon, a spokeswoman for Manchin. "Senator Manchin
believes it's time for leaders to put political agendas aside,
reevaluate and adjust to the economic realities the country faces to
avoid taking steps that add fuel to the inflation fire.]{.underline}"
[The stunning setback late Thursday came despite weeks of seemingly
promising negotiations between Schumer and Manchin in pursuit of a
broader deal that would have delivered on the promises that secured
Democrats control of both chambers of Congress and the White House in
2020. **Without Manchin,** **the party cannot proceed in the narrowly
divided Senate,** since Democrats need all 50 votes in the caucus, plus
Vice President Harris's tiebreaking vote, to use the special process
known as budget reconciliation to overcome Republicans' expected
filibuster.]{.underline} Democrats see hope for spending deal with
Manchin as Congress returns. [To win over Manchin, Democrats already had
agreed to surrender their most prized spending proposals]{.underline},
from offering paid family and medical leave to providing child care,
free prekindergarten and tax benefits to low-income Americans. But their
cuts still proved insufficient for the austerity-minded moderate, who in
recent days grew ever more skittish amid reports of record-high prices.
This week, new data showed that inflation rose at its highest rate in
roughly 40 years, prompting Manchin to tell reporters Wednesday that he
would be "cautious" about any new federal spending. [But Manchin's new
opposition leaves Democrats in a difficult political bind: They must
decide between pressing him after months of false starts or accepting
what would still be significant changes to the law lowering health care
costs.]{.underline} A package addressing health care, for example, could
spare roughly 13 million people from higher insurance costs in January
if lawmakers act swiftly. Manchin has endorsed a two-year extension.
Similar trade-offs previously prompted Biden's top aides to deliver a
stinging rebuke of Manchin, though the White House late Thursday did not
immediately respond to a request for comment.

3\. NATO AS A CYBERSPACE ALLIANCE [The logic of international alliance
is that bigger is usually better when defending against
threats.5]{.underline} Although the size of the alliance and the need
for consensus can complicate warfighting,6 the concept of a common
defense means that an adversary faces the combined militaries of
multiple countries. In a world in which attackers are dissuaded by the
prospect that united countries will interpose their forces between
attackers and those being defended, the premise that more is better
makes intuitive sense. [But combat in cyberspace does not really benefit
from economies of scale]{.underline}. Within a country, [adding
more]{.underline} offensive [cyber warriors]{.underline} often
[means]{.underline} lowering the qualifications (at least initially, and
perhaps in the long term) for what is, by nature, an inherently elite
profession. This [means not only that]{.underline} [diminishing
returns]{.underline} set in, [but that]{.underline} the [activities of
the good-but-not-great can well tip off the other side]{.underline}. So
tipped, the other side can improve its defenses in ways that are
specific (e.g., vulnerabilities are patched after having been
discovered) and general (i.e., a shift occurs in the tradeoff between
security and cost/convenience). Correspondingly, the contribution of
additional operators is limited. When these operators come from other
countries, their contribution is further vitiated unless these countries
operate seamlessly. Within an intelligence-sharing alliance (e.g., the
Five Eyes), additional members do add heft (each country, for instance,
can employ relationships that it has developed with communications
companies around the world). Once seams intrude -- and these seams are
larger within NATO than within the Five Eyes -- the level of
coordination is less and the prospects for interference (e.g., two
countries seeking access to the same target system) are greater. When it
comes to defense, the arguments that vitiate the benefits mass are
different but similar. A large percentage of all [cyber defense efforts
requires looking after specific systems.]{.underline} Adding allies adds
more systems to defend. This hardly helps defenders of existing
systems.7 [Although there are defense activities where adding countries
may help]{.underline} -- e.g., intelligence fusion, collective learning,
and forensics -- **[none of these really requires a military
alliance,]{.underline}** and some of the contributors for these three
efforts live in the private realm. Alliances also express their weight
through deterrence policies. In the Cold War, the United States deterred
attacks by the Soviet Union on NATO allies with a nuclear threat:
certainly, if the attacks involved nuclear weapons, and quite possibly
if the attack involved overwhelming conventional force. In recent years
the U.S. deterrence policy in cyberspace has been notionally extended to
a NATO deterrence policy. Unfortunately, U.S. deterrence policy for
attacks on the homeland is already an uncertain thing -- and extending
it adds further uncertainties. There are, for instance, serious
questions about what constitutes a cyberattack serious enough to merit
retaliation and what the form of retaliation would be; the United States
has used sanctions in response to malign cyberspace activities, but
there is little evidence that sanctions have deterred Russia, Iran, or
North Korea.8 NATO's retaliation capabilities -- which are largely US
retaliation capabilities (plus some UK capabilities) -- are even less
likely to be brought into play if the target of a cyberattack were
European. In the five years prior to North Korea's hack of Sony -- which
the United States did respond to -- South Korea suffered far worse
depredations with no U.S. response.9 4. AND WHY IS THE NATO GROUPING NOT
THE OBVIOUS ONE? Yet Europeans lean on NATO; in large part, because it
already exists and therefore does not need to be invented. But NATO is a
military alliance, while cyberspace is essentially a conduit for
information,10 hence generally dominated by the community that deals
with information qua intelligence. And the existence of the Five Eyes
coalition only underlines this point: working relationships among that
coalition in the information domain are tighter than they are in the
information domain across the NATO alliance. And two of the Five Eyes
are not even in NATO. In other words, the real coalition is not doing
Europe (the UK excepted) in particular that much good. This matters,
because the primary cyber war threat to Europe is from Russia, and the
primary targets of Russian coercion are in European countries that face
Russia. Two of the countries that face the gravest threats are not even
in NATO. Correspondingly[, a Baltic cyberspace alliance]{.underline}
would have a limited ambit: members would cooperate on defense and aver
that a cyberattack on one is an attack on all. In practice, were such an
arrangement made, the alliance [would have its own definition of what
constitutes an "attack"; it might include social media
manipulation]{.underline}. A cyberspace alliance, as such, would have
three facets but lack one. The [first facet is defense: each country
would putatively participate more vigorously in]{.underline} those
[cyber defense activities that benefit from scale, as
noted]{.underline}: **[threat intelligence, forensics, lessons
learned.]{.underline}** [With very large cyberattacks]{.underline},
[they could offer mutual aid for systems restoration]{.underline}. T[he
second facet is]{.underline} defense by [deterrence]{.underline}. It
[would require a consensus on what constitutes an actionable offense in
cyberspace]{.underline}, notably the type and severity; what responses
are appropriate (e.g., to an attack on the local power grid); and what
kind of capability is required to retaliate in cyberspace. One rationale
for responding in cyberspace is that less forceful options, such as
alliance-wide sanctions, are likely to be even weaker than U.S.
sanctions are. Conversely, threatening kinetic responses -- given the
lack of nuclear weapons among proposed alliance members -- lacks
credibility thanks to Russia's escalation dominance. The third facet
would consist of [offensive cyberspace operations used for]{.underline}
coercive or, more likely[, counter-coercive purposes or for retaliation
against grave non-cyber offenses]{.underline} (e.g., the Skripal
poisonings11). By contrast, cyberspace operations in support of kinetic
operations (e.g., taking a SAM site offline while a NATO sortie flies
overhead) would fall outside such an alliance because kinetic operations
fall to NATO; if individual members carried out tactical cyberattacks,
they would fall under NATO auspices (or their own fights). 5.
CHARACTERISTICS AND ADVANTAGES OF A BALTIC CYBERSPACE ALLIANCE What are
the characteristics and advantages of such an alliance to its member
countries? First, [the alliance, limited to cyberspace]{.underline},
[would invariably focus on Russia]{.underline}, despite having to tend
to other threats (e.g., from China's commercially-motivated
cyberespionage) and despite the possibility that alliance members would
probably be diplomatic in public about the alliance's purpose. [Russia's
cyberspace threats are malevolent]{.underline}, politically-directed,
[and often part of a larger campaign to sow disorder and facilitate
coercion]{.underline}. NATO countries, as a whole, are not entirely
focused on Russia, these days: those in North America pay as much
attention to China;12 those near the Mediterranean tend to look
southward. Second, such an alliance would include currently neutral
countries, notably Sweden and Finland. Both countries punch above their
weight, in cyberspace operations13 and information operations14
respectively. This raises the question: why don't such countries just
enter NATO? To be sure, roughly half the citizens in both countries
would like to -- but the other half fear, justifiably, a neuralgic
Russian reaction if they did (Finland's accession could put troops along
miles of Russian borders). Although Russians would likely react badly to
the formation of a Baltic cyberspace alliance, they would have a more
difficult time summoning images of jackbooted soldiers while doing so.
For Sweden and Finland, the cyberspace alliance could serve as a halfway
house. If the Russian threat eases, their entry into NATO can be
indefinitely postponed (in the unlikely event that the Russian
cyberspace threat disappears, they can leave or the cyberspace alliance
might wither away). If the Russian threat persists or worsens, these two
countries will have had more practice interoperating with NATO
countries, thereby easing their way into an alliance that spans the
conventional domains of warfare. Third, a [cyberspace alliance would be
a mechanism to get Germany to become more involved]{.underline} --
[or]{.underline}, more to the point, [take leadership]{.underline} --
[in defending Europ]{.underline}e against Russia. The [current
contribution of German]{.underline} military [spending]{.underline} (1.2
percent of GDP) to the common defense of NATO [is modest]{.underline}.
Germany, [nevertheless]{.underline}, remains Europe's largest economy,
and would constitute roughly half of the weight of any Baltic cyberspace
alliance. [Germany]{.underline} [has]{.underline} also [stepped up
smartly in developing]{.underline} its [Cyber]{.underline} and
Information Domain [Service]{.underline}. Its manning, if plans hold,15
would constitute 7.5 percent of Germany's total force level (13,500 out
of 180,000);16 its spending would be 6.3 percent of Germany's military
(41.5 billion Euro) budget.17 By way of contrast, USCYBERCOM's
end-strength goal of 6,000 compares to 1.3 million military personnel in
the overall U.S. military -- less than a tenth as much concentration on
cyberspace. Granted, this is not an apples-to-apples comparison:
Germany's end strength includes electronic warfare battalions;
USCYBERCOM's end-strength does not. But, even after adjustments,
[Germany's commitment to fighting in cyberspace, relative to its overall
military strength, looks more substantial than the U.S.
commitment.]{.underline} Furthermore[, a German focus on
cyberspace]{.underline} (vis-à-vis kinetic elements of military power)
[is]{.underline}, again, [less likely to engender a neuralgic reaction
from Russia]{.underline} (no jackboots, etc.) [but does put Russia on
notice that its maneuvers in cyberspace have not gone unnoticed and will
be resisted by those best placed to resist them.]{.underline} **[The
advantage of such an alliance]{.underline}** to its members is that they
put the power of all in service of each. This **[should give Russians
second thoughts]{.underline}** [about]{.underline} their **[use of
cyberspace for offensive purposes]{.underline}** -- although it may also
initially goad them into carrying out operations against the non-NATO
countries (Sweden and Finland) to inhibit their participation in such an
alliance. Russia's doing so, conversely, could very well reinforce the
value to today's neutral countries of having others to lean on when
facing Russia. The countries in this alliance would be self-selected by
virtue of their concern over Russian activities in cyberspace. By
contrast, [a unified and meaningful NATO response]{.underline} to
Russian provocations has to surmount the objections of countries that
reserve some sympathy for Russia (Hungary and Greece come to mind).
Fourth, this [would give NATO competition in the alliance
business.]{.underline} Arguably, this would weaken NATO -- and is
thereby a disadvantage. But competition can also be good: it persuades
competitors to listen to their clients (customers, audience, etc.) and
induces them to innovate in order to retain their standing. Otherwise,
secure in the knowledge that their position is unassailable, they risk
becoming sluggish and unresponsive -- and when they fall or come apart,
it is often "first slowly and then all at once".18 Thus, [when offering
cyber security or countering cyberattacks, **relevant countries can
ask** the institutions of NATO and also those of the **Baltic cyberspace
alliance what each of them can do** --]{.underline} [each knowing that
they are competing both against Russia's malign influence and the
other's benign influence.]{.underline} But competition can also raise
problems: an institutionally aggressive cyberspace alliance may seek
greater influence by stretching the definition of a cyberattack: e.g.,
to include electronic warfare, interference with space operations, and
sabotage of or attacks on information infrastructures. 6. ADVANTAGES FOR
THE UNITED STATES [The most basic advantage is that it makes Europeans
more responsible for their own defense]{.underline}, albeit in just this
one domain. In the 1980s, for example, three neutral countries --
Switzerland, Sweden, and Finland -- spent far higher proportions of
their income on national defense than most European NATO allies did.19
[The "free rider" problem is, if anything, worse today.]{.underline} It
may be that much more difficult to persuade European countries to arm
themselves if, when such arms have to be used, it would be under a war
effort led by the United States. The return of Russia as an aggressive
power, since roughly late 2013, may not have been internalized by
European countries, concerned as they are with internal fissures -- many
of which, ironically, were deliberately exacerbated by Russia's
information warfare campaign. **[And the U.S. pivot to
Asia]{.underline}**, while more advertised than practiced, [would
necessarily mean **a shift in U.S. resources** that would otherwise be
available for Europe.]{.underline} But [in cyberspace]{.underline},
[countries in a Baltic cyberspace alliance would be pooling their
resources]{.underline} under either their own individual command ([as
befits an activity so highly linked to intelligence]{.underline}) or, at
least under the command of Europeans. And with the United States not in
such an alliance, [there is much less of a "free rider"
problem]{.underline} (even if Germany would be roughly half the
alliance, countries such as Sweden, Finland, and Estonia punch above
their weight in this domain). The downside of the upside is akin to the
owner of a hammer being persuaded that every problem is a nail: if given
a choice between responding to hostile actions in the kinetic world and
responding in cyberspace, the latter may be seen as particularly
attractive because it relies on tools the alliance can wield themselves
rather than tools largely wielded by the United States. Another
advantage for the United States is that such an alliance may complicate
Russia's cyber war efforts -- largely by increasing the uncertainty that
Russian efforts may be met with reprisals: the odds of retaliation from
either the United States (as the premier cyberspace power of NATO) or
from the Baltic cyberspace alliance will be higher than the odds of
retaliation from each of them. This is particularly true for those
cyberattacks that leave multiple victims: NotPetya, as an example,
levied costs in the hundreds of millions of dollars from Merck and
Federal Express (both U.S.-headquartered corporations) and from Maersk
(headquartered in Denmark). The raised odds for a response may arise
from meeting credibility thresholds (the United States may be wary and
the Baltic cyberspace alliance less so or vice versa), attribution
thresholds (the United States may have confidence and the Baltic
cyberspace alliance may not or vice versa), and damage thresholds (the
United States may recognize a higher threshold to warrant its
retaliation if the effects of the cyberattack fall primarily on
Europeans). Both the United States and the Baltic cyberspace alliance
may retaliate but against different targets.20 [An associated benefit is
that if the modus operandi of whatever cyberspace operations ensue from
NATO]{.underline} (that is, in practice, from the United States or the
UK) [and the Baltic cyberspace alliance are sufficiently
similar]{.underline}, [it may not be clear to Russia who struck
back]{.underline}. **[This would complicate
counter-retaliation]{.underline}** targeting (and threats), in
anticipation of which retaliation may be more likely, [and the prospect
thereof more credible]{.underline}. To be fair, attack-retaliation
cycles in cyberspace remain loose: the closest example of a retaliatory
cyberattack was the late 2012 DDOS campaign against U.S. banks by an
Iran that had, two years earlier, discovered that its nuclear program
had been set back by the Stuxnet worm.
Attack-retaliation-counter-retaliation cycles are even more nthorder
relationships. Furthermore, Russia may have the SIGINT or HUMINT to make
its own attribution -- or it may not care and may conclude that the
Baltic cyberspace alliance is an arm of NATO despite the former having
neutral countries in it; indeed, it may see all opposing alliances as
arms of the United States, facts notwithstanding.

Conclusion

For the US an unstable and insecure Europe that is fractured internally
and whose borders are challenged by a belligerent Russia would
constitute the greatest foreign policy disaster since the Second World
War. To prevent such developments, [[NATO must revive its **core
mandate**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[of defending]{.mark} the
**[Europe]{.mark}an homeland**]{.underline} and focus less on
out-of-area operations. [[By shifting]{.underline}]{.mark} bases and
[[equipment **eastward**]{.underline}]{.mark} to confront the newest
threats, [[NATO can help ensure that it has]{.underline}]{.mark}
sufficient manpower and [[firepower to dissuade a Russian
offensive]{.mark} against the most exposed Alliance
members]{.underline}. [An effective NATO remains the **key
institution**]{.underline} [for protecting Europe's
security]{.underline}. [[It may]{.mark} also [be]{.mark}come

Emerging threats from Moscow

The fourth and most important reason why [a substantial NATO military
presence in Eastern Europe is **vital** is that it forms the most
effective deterrent and responder to **major new threats**]{.underline}.
Two core challenges emanate from Russia: expansion and implosion.
Moscow's primary objective is to restore Russia as a major pole of power
in a multi-polar world. The overarching goal with regard to the West is
to reverse US influences in Europe and Eurasia. Russia's neo-imperial
project seeks predominant influence over the foreign and security
policies of immediate neighbours so that they will either remain neutral
or support Russia's agenda. In effect, Russia seeks dependent
protectorates along its borders, tied into institutions controlled from
Moscow (Bugajski and Doran 2016).

While its goals are imperial, the Kremlin's strategies and tactics are
flexible, and this can make them more effective than if they were rigid.
Moscow engages in enticements, threats, incentives and pressures, while
claiming it is pragmatically pursuing its national interests. [It
pursues **asymmetrical offensives**]{.underline} [by interjecting itself
in its **neighbours' affairs**]{.underline}, capturing important sectors
of local economies, [subverting **vulnerable political
systems**]{.underline}, corrupting national leaders, penetrating key
security institutions, challenging territorial integrity [and
undermining **international unity**.]{.underline}

[Moscow is also not averse to using **direct military
force**]{.underline}, as exemplified by the war against Georgia in
August 2008, followed by the forced partitioning of Abkhazia and South
Ossetia, and the attack on Ukraine in March 2014 with the annexation of
Crimea. According to a recent report by RAND Corporation, given current
force deployments, [Russia could **steamroll** across the Baltic states
of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania with ground forces reaching the three
capitals in a **matter of hours**]{.underline}. Without a more intensive
regional presence, NATO forces would not have the ability to defend its
most exposed states (Shlapak and Johnson 2016). Hence, the factor of
deterrence may have limited value if Moscow decides to test NATO's
response.

The RAND report mirrors the concerns of Chairman of the NATO Military
Committee General Petr Pavel, who has warned that Moscow could conquer
the three Baltic states within two days despite their NATO membership.
This is possible because of Russia's ongoing military expansion, NATO's
relatively slow-moving command structure, and the decline in Alliance
capabilities because of lowered defence spending and the withdrawal of
US forces, including two heavily armoured US divisions from Germany,
with only two now remaining in Europe.

Russia's potential implosion could present an even more unpredictable
future in which NATO would need to manage the multi-regional
repercussions. A huge failed state on Europe's doorstep would have
various destabilising consequences for the continent---whether refugee
outflows, the spillover of violence, civil wars or the emergence of new
aspiring states. Paradoxically, Putin's attempts to construct a new
Russia-centred dominion are likely to accelerate the country's decline.

An economically and militarily overstretched Russia may witness
escalating economic, social, political and sub-regional turmoil and
present even more menacing challenges for Western policy. NATO needs to
assess the possible consequences of the chaotic downfall of the Putinist
system and prepare contingencies for the conflicts that this may
generate. In particular, Russia's neighbours must be shielded from the
most destabilising scenarios of civil conflict and Russia's violent
fragmentation, which could spill into NATO territory. By positioning
permanent NATO bases in the countries bordering Russia, the Alliance
would be better prepared for the negative consequences.

NATO realism

[NATO's European flank remains dependent on the US for its security, as
its defence expenditures have been **seriously depleted**]{.underline}
since the end of the Cold War. [Without American involvement Europe
would be **unable to deter** an increasingly belligerent
Russia]{.underline}. [Europe's **demilitarisation**]{.underline} over
the last decade [has coincided with Russia's military
build-up]{.underline} (Michta 2015). [The US provides **70**
%]{.underline} [of all NATO defence spending]{.underline}, while
[Europe's contribution to NATO's military capability is less than 25
%,]{.underline} [and the figure is **steadily falling**]{.underline}.
Several [countries]{.underline} have decimated their equipment to such
an extent that they [may be incapable of deploying more than a few
thousand troops in the event of **outright war**]{.underline}.
Meanwhile, Russia is re-arming to the tune of \$700 billion over the
next decade and plans to introduce the next generation of armour,
aircraft and missiles, and to modernise its nuclear forces.

One such institution is [the EU]{.underline}. Because cyberattacks can
influence economic and political well-being, there is a natural
compatibility between the EU's mission and collective action to help
promote cybersecurity. Certain critical infrastructures under threat

Baltic. What about France? On the one hand, France's emphasis on
cyberspace25 looks much like Germany's, and the bilateral relationship
between France and Germany can be understood as the cornerstone of
Europe's stability. On the other hand, geography (e.g., distance from
Russia) and history (e.g., former colonies) may lead France to different
perspectives from Germany on the Russian threat from cyberspace. [What

thus, any intelligence-sharing arrangement the UK has with Baltic states
necessary means similar intelligence-sharing arrangements with all the
other Five Eyes members (notably, the United States), who may be
uncomfortable with such sharing. Furthermore, the advantage of ambiguity
afforded by having two independent alliances taking on Russia in
cyberspace would be vitiated if both alliances contained the same member

THE COMPLEXITY OF EMPLOYING MODERN WEAPONS SYSTEMS

As dramatic as these weapons shortfalls are, European defense
spending---if allocated properly---could eventually secure the needed
systems. Yet, [not only is the efficient allocation of resources a major
challenge because of Europe's strategic cacophony]{.underline} (as
detailed below), [but securing the needed weapons systems would only be
the first step]{.underline}.

[The effective [employment]{.mark} of **[modern weapons]{.mark}**
[systems is]{.mark}]{.underline} far more
**[[challenging]{.underline}]{.mark}** than in past eras for a variety
of reasons. [A key consideration is the immense premium put on command,
control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and
reconnaissance]{.underline} (**[C4ISR]{.underline}**).
[C4ISR]{.underline}---often referred to as [the]{.underline} "**[nervous
system]{.underline}**" [of modern militaries]{.underline}---[is crucial
for gathering]{.underline} information about the combatants, for
effectively [processing]{.underline} that information, and for
[disseminating and using]{.underline} that [**information** to develop
and implement complex plans]{.underline}.99 NATO's 2011 mission in Libya
shows the heavy reliance of Europeans on the United States' C4ISR
capacity. [[Europeans]{.mark} would]{.underline} therefore [need to
develop their own C4ISR capacity to be able to autonomously balance
Russia]{.underline}, which would not be an easy undertaking given that
Russia is no Libya. They [[would need]{.mark} [**large amounts**
of]{.mark} new [C4ISR]{.mark} systems]{.underline} (e.g., reconnaissance
and communication **[satellites]{.underline}**; [early
warning]{.underline} and control **[aircraft]{.underline}**;
[**[sensor]{.mark}** [systems]{.mark}]{.underline}; [air,
[naval]{.mark}, and land command and control
**[platforms]{.mark}**]{.underline}), the most complex of [[which
have]{.mark} very [long development times]{.mark}]{.underline}. Notably,
the already significant difficulty of Europeans assembling the needed
systems would be made even more acute if the UK's exit from the EU ends
up meaning that British capabilities also need to be replaced: at
present, the UK detains, among other capabilities, 53 percent of the
EU's combat intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance heavy unmanned
aerial vehicles (CISR UAVs), 42 percent of airborne early warning and
control aircraft, and 38 percent of electronicintelligence aircraft.100

In addition, [European [countries lack]{.mark}]{.underline} the kind of
**[[specialized personnel]{.underline}]{.mark}** needed to operate
modern weapons systems effectively. [Redressing this weakness would be a
significant undertaking, as they have reduced their number of military
personnel **drastically**]{.underline} since the end of the Cold War. As
figure 2 shows, [the size of]{.underline} the total active
[militaries]{.underline} of the large European powers [declined by **57
percent**]{.underline} during the 1990--2020 period.101 Furthermore,
[beyond the difficulty of securing the financial resources]{.underline}
to pay the needed personnel, [[recruiting]{.mark} sufficient
**specialized [personnel]{.mark}** [would be a]{.mark} **[major
challenge]{.mark}**]{.underline}, as demonstrated by the difficulties
faced by many European militaries in attracting personnel for skilled
positions.102 Notably, [[a recent study has shown]{.underline}]{.mark}
that the employment of advanced weaponry calls for [[**highly skilled**
and]{.underline}]{.mark} highly **[[trained]{.underline}]{.mark}**
military [[personnel]{.underline}]{.mark}, which
[[are]{.underline}]{.mark} now [more [difficult to recruit and
retain]{.mark} in the military]{.underline}.103 Obtaining specialized
military personnel to operate modern weaponry is only the beginning;
they must also be trained to effectively use modern weapons, which is
extremely challenging and time consuming, partially because these
weapons need to be used as part of a cohesive package that places a
premium not just on information gathering, but also on coordination and
delegation.104 [[It has taken U.S.]{.mark} military [personnel]{.mark}
an **extraordinarily long time**]{.underline} [to develop the skills
required for effectively using today's weapons systems]{.underline}: as
Posen stresses, the United States' "development of new weapons and

Europeans]{.mark} **even [longer]{.mark}** to develop the needed skills,
**[given differences]{.mark}** across countries regarding operational
cultures, levels of ambition, languages, and so on]{.underline}.106
Finally, the effective use of modern weaponry in the European theater
depends on European forces being able to move quickly and securely over
large distances within Europe. Yet, as a UK parliamentary report puts
it, "NATO has difficulty moving large forces" across Europe.107 In
recent years, the Europeans have sought to bolster military mobility
through a variety of initiatives dispersed across different institutions
(within both the EU and NATO).108 Yet, the movement and
**[[training]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[of]{.underline}]{.mark} military
[personnel and [assets]{.mark} in Europe [remain]{.mark} **severely

THE FRAGMENTATION OF EUROPE'S DEFENSE INDUSTRIAL BASE

If Europeans want to be strategically autonomous, they will have to
produce the defense systems they need without being reliant on the
United States. The entrenched fragmentation of Europe' defense
industrial base, however, would make this a daunting task.

On the demand side, European states have consistently privileged
domestically procured defense equipment over European arms cooperation.
According to data from the European Defense Agency, from 2006 to 2015,
collaborative defense procurement in Europe accounted for less than one
quarter of total procurement.120 For example, [[a **mere 7
percent**]{.mark} [of the European]{.mark}]{.underline} surface
[[vessels]{.mark} currently in use [have been built through]{.mark}
European armament [coop]{.mark}eration]{.underline}.121 As for fighter
aircraft---where the economic incentives for Europeanwide collaboration
are especially powerful given the immense cost and complexity of these
systems---there has been relatively limited defense cooperation: less
than a third (32.6 percent) of combat aircraft used by EU militaries
come from European collaborative production.122 Similarly, [European
states spend **more than 80 percent** of their military
research-and-development budgets within national
borders]{.underline}.123

On the supply side, [[these **compartmentalized**]{.mark} **national**
[markets]{.mark} for weapons systems have [resulted in]{.mark} a
**[fragmented]{.mark}** [and]{.mark}
**[noncompetitive]{.mark}**]{.underline} European defense and
technological industrial base (**[[EDTIB]{.underline}]{.mark}**)
[[characterized by **duplication**]{.mark}, **inefficiencies**,
**endemic overcapacity**, [and a lack of **economies of
scale**]{.mark}]{.underline}.124 In 2017, [178 different weapons systems
were in use in the EU, compared to 30 in the United
States]{.underline}.125 As a result, the components that sustain the
industrial capacity to deliver high-end to low-end capabilities are
scattered across Europe.126 [[This is a **significant problem**]{.mark}
[given]{.mark} that **today's** [scale requirements are
**massive**]{.mark} for many weapons systems, which]{.underline} also
[explains why [Europe remains]{.mark} **[highly
dependent]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[on the import of]{.underline}]{.mark}
key [components and [weapons]{.mark} systems [from the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}.127

Europe has recognized the need for stronger defense production
coordination for a long time, and the mechanisms for fostering
European-wide collaboration in weapons production have been a topic of
discussion for the past several decades. On the demand side, this
coordination would require a uniform European procurement policy, with
common requirements and with defense industrial cooperation among EU
countries being prioritized over national procurement.128 And on the
supply side, this would require an integrated defense and technological
industrial base (e.g., with one or two major European prime contractors
per sector) capable of sustaining military innovation and the
development, production, and maintenance of arms at reasonable cost.

Yet, efforts to formulate the kinds of policies that would foster
Europeanwide defense collaboration have been feeble. As Matthew Uttley
explains, [[initiatives take]{.underline}]{.mark}n
[[over]{.underline}]{.mark} the [**[years]{.mark}** [to
rationalize]{.mark} and bolster the EDTIB]{.underline} have had a
"limited impact," [because governments see a strong national DTIB as a
**necessary prerequisite**]{.underline} [for national political
**sovereignty** and]{.underline}, as a result, "[national protectionist
practices]{.underline}" [remain]{.underline} "[the dominant **driving
force** in E.U. defense procurement]{.underline}."129 [A report by the
European Parliament confirms that a key reason for this lack of
collaboration is Europe's **strategic cacophony**]{.underline},
specifically, "[the current **fragmentation** of the defense market in
terms of demand, regulations, standards and supply]{.underline}."130

If the United States were to pull back from Europe, it remains to be
seen whether the Europeans could rely on a "Europeanized" NATO, in which
the integrated structures would stay in place but without the United
States.115 [[Military planning]{.mark} and C2 [require a **clear
chain**]{.mark} [of command]{.mark}]{.underline}. [When NATO was
created, Europeans agreed to be under U.S. military command, rather than
attempting the far more **difficult task** of agreeing to be under the
command of another European country or group]{.underline} of European
states. More generally, as the hegemonic power in NATO, [[the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates has [facilitated]{.mark}
**[institutionalized coop]{.mark}eration**]{.underline} [among Europeans
and helped]{.underline} partly [contain Europe's strategic
cacophony]{.underline}.116 [For decades, [a U.S.-led NATO has been
the]{.mark} **overarching [shaper]{.mark}**]{.underline} [of national
defense policies and military transformation in Europe, [helping
overcome]{.mark} **[coordination]{.mark}** [and]{.mark}
**[collective-action]{.mark}** [problems]{.mark}]{.underline}.117 In
light of Europe's deep-seated strategic divisions, [a [U.S.
disengagement would]{.mark} **amplify** these coordination and
collective action problems]{.underline} (assuming NATO survived) [and
would **further [hinder]{.mark}** institutionalized, intra-European
defense cooperation at all levels]{.underline}: [[**strategies**]{.mark}
and **doctrines**]{.underline}; **[[training]{.underline}]{.mark}**;
**[operational learning]{.underline}**;
**[[interop]{.mark}erability]{.underline}**; [and **joint capability
development**]{.underline}. Likewise, [without the United States, the
persistent and profound divergence of threat perceptions and strategic
priorities among Europeans is likely to impede their capacity to
agree]{.underline} on shared C2 structures for conducting operations,
except for the lowest end of the spectrum of conflict (e.g., peace
support operations).118

As a result of strategic cacophony, [[the EU has]{.underline}]{.mark},
in fact, [[struggled]{.mark} mightily [to create even the **most
minimal**]{.mark} [C2]{.mark} structure]{.underline}. As Luis Simón
underscores, "It has taken nearly 20 years of allegedly significant
steps for the European Union to establish a 'Military Planning and
Conduct Capability' composed of up to 25 staffers, devoted to assisting
with the planning and conduct of so-called non-executive (i.e., training
and assistance) missions," with an advisory role only.119 Ultimately,
given Europe's deep-seated divergences, there is no basis for optimism
that Europeans will be able to agree being under the permanent command
of another European country for deterrence and defense or to
consistently undertake effective institutionalized military cooperation
without the enabling role played by the United States within NATO.

THE DIFFICULTY OF INSTITUTIONALIZED MILITARY COOPERATION

An additional challenge is institutional.
[[Europe's]{.underline}]{.mark} strategic [[cacophony]{.mark} has
[prevented Europeans from developing an **autonomous**]{.mark},
military-planning]{.underline}, command and control
(**[[C2]{.underline}]{.mark}**) [structure]{.underline}.110 Indeed, a
report by the European Parliamentary Research Service explains that [one
of [the **greatest challenges**]{.mark}]{.underline} of European defense
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} "[[the **lack of integration**]{.mark}
[of]{.mark} the [military structures]{.mark} of the Member
States]{.underline}."111 Although an effective and autonomous European
defense would require the creation of a permanent planning and C2
infrastructure, the question of developing an autonomous Operational
Headquarters (OHQ) has proven highly divisive.112 An OHQ was never
established because of conflicting national interests and priorities
among [[Europeans]{.underline}]{.mark}, in particular France, Germany
and the UK. Whereas Paris has long supported the establishment of a
military OHQ to bolster the EU's strategic and operational planning
structures and its contingency planning and C2 capacity, London has
**[[strongly resisted]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[seeing it as a
**duplication**]{.mark} [of NATO's assets]{.mark}]{.underline}. Germany
has stood somewhat in between, though closer to the UK, favoring a focus
on civilian-military planning and C2, not least to avoid duplicating
structures already existing at NATO.113 As a result, [[the EU
remains]{.mark} **entirely [dependent]{.mark}** [on
NATO]{.mark}]{.underline} or national assets [[for]{.mark} the
**[planning]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} **[conduct]{.mark}** [of]{.mark}

Abstract

Twenty-five years after the end of the Cold War, there is no viable
alternative to NATO's security umbrella over an expanded Europe. [[The
**eastern**]{.underline}]{.mark} [part of the [continent is confronting
a]{.mark} **[revisionist]{.mark}** and **expansionist**
[Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Its stability can only be ensured by an
**effective alliance**]{.underline} that establishes permanent bases in
the most vulnerable regions [as a **deterrent** to Moscow's

Introduction

Twenty-five years after the end of the Cold War, there is no viable
alternative on the horizon to NATO's security umbrella over an expanded
Europe. The idea floated a quarter of a century ago that Europe could
scale down its defences and even dismantle the North Atlantic Alliance
exposed a flawed fixation on an 'end of history' scenario that has never
materialised. In practice, the forces of state nationalism and
imperialist revisionism in Russia have proved stronger than those of
liberalism and international cooperation with the West.

In many respects, a 'return of history' scenario has become more evident
in and around Europe, with Russia re-emerging as a revanchist power and
threatening Europe's entire eastern flank. In addition, [[the EU]{.mark}
itself [faces]{.mark} **[existential problems]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[from the financial and institutional to the demographic and
political]{.underline}. [[In a]{.mark} potentially **unstable** and
[**fracturing** continent,]{.mark} [NATO is the **sole**]{.mark}
remaining [institution]{.mark} that upholds international
security]{.underline}. And [it may become the sole multinational
organisation [that can provide]{.mark} Europe with a measure of
**[coherence]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Moreover, [[NATO is the **binding
glue**]{.mark} of the transatlantic link with Washington]{.underline}.

NATO without alternatives

Several Western European states have hosted US bases since the creation
of NATO in April 1949. Since the end of the Cold War and the dismantling
of the Soviet bloc in the early 1990s, numerous voices among the new
NATO members have called for permanent bases that would include US
troops in the eastern part of the continent. Such voices have grown
louder as Russia under President Vladimir Putin has become increasingly
assertive and is now threatening the independence of numerous states,
from the Baltic region to the Black and Caspian Seas.

A NATO alliance that encompasses all of Europe with a permanent
multinational military presence in Europe's east is essential for four
fundamental reasons. First, [[there **is no**]{.mark} **viable
[alternative]{.mark}** [to NATO]{.mark}'s political and military
structure]{.underline}. [[The EU does not]{.mark} provide security or
**[generate confidence]{.mark}** [among states facing]{.mark} potential
[aggression]{.mark}]{.underline}. The EU's Common Foreign and Security
Policy is primarily a diplomatic mechanism, which openly acknowledges
that NATO remains responsible for the territorial defence of Europe.
Although the EU has engaged in several peacekeeping, policing and
humanitarian missions, NATO possesses the main combat force not only of
its European members, but most importantly of [[the
US]{.underline}]{.mark}, which [[contributes a **disproportionate
share**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[of]{.mark} Alliance **troops**,
**[equipment]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} other
**[resources]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[A **strong** [NATO alliance is the]{.mark} **[backbone]{.mark}** [of
European security]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Proposals for [a European
Army]{.mark}]{.underline} simply [**[dilute]{.mark}** [and]{.mark}
**[distract]{.mark}** attention [from the **only
capable**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[multinational]{.mark} Western [security
organisation]{.mark}]{.underline}. [A [Europe]{.mark}an Army
[would]{.mark} not only **[siphon]{.mark} off** [NATO's]{.mark} already
**[limited assets]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and diminish its
capabilities]{.mark}, [but would]{.mark} also **[trigger
rivalries]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[between Europe and]{.mark} North
[America]{.mark}]{.underline} over the deployment of military forces.
Additionally, [it could **split Europe** between countries committed to
upholding close security relations with the US and states at a safer
distance from Russia that see a lesser need for American security
guarantees]{.underline}. [[Such an outcome would]{.mark} in effect
[grant Moscow a]{.mark} **[strategic victory]{.mark}** [over
NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}.

### EU\-\--Britain

#### Britain is [key]{.underline} to the Baltics.

**Gallardo 22** \[Cristina Gallardo, POLITICO reporter; 3-8-2022;

KL\]

LONDON --- Amid fears they could be Russia's next target, [the Baltic
countries hope **[Britain]{.mark}** can **[amplify their
calls]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[for]{.mark} more [military
support]{.mark} from **NATO**]{.underline}.

[[**Security cooperation** between the U.K. and the]{.mark} three
[Baltic]{.mark} states]{.underline} --- Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania
--- [[has]{.mark} long [been]{.mark} regarded as
**[strong]{.mark}**]{.underline} and unaffected by the drama of Brexit.

But [since]{.underline} Russia invaded [Ukraine]{.underline} last month,
[this relationship has taken on a **new dimension**, and become a
**clear axis**]{.underline} in Europe's wider security debate.

The Baltics have compiled a "wishlist" of demands to better protect
their borders, including permanent NATO bases and air defense systems,
which the region does not currently have. They are painfully aware that
Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded in December that NATO withdraw
all its forces from the region, once part of the Soviet Union.

Their requests have met with a sympathetic response in London, where the
government is happy to support their case.

Echoing the Baltics' worst fears, U.K. Defense Secretary Ben Wallace
warned last month Putin "will use everything" in the Baltic states. "He
doesn't believe the Baltic states are really countries," he told the
BBC.

A British defense official described the Baltics as "the frontline of
NATO security" and said: "We share their concerns that, now more than
ever, NATO's eastern flank needs to deter a Russia that has no regard
for international law and sovereign borders."

In a sign of the importance with which Britain now views the Baltics,
the U.K's Foreign Secretary Liz Truss traveled to the Lithuanian capital
Vilnius last week in an attempt to reassure governments it has their
back.

"What we have to do now is we have to strengthen NATO, we particularly
have to strengthen the eastern flank," she told the House of Commons
Monday. "We have to be serious about defense spending, right across
NATO."

Even with the U.K.'s support, however, the rest of NATO will take some
convincing to meet the Baltic demands --- and especially to pay for
them. For years, NATO hesitated over having significant troop numbers in
the Baltic countries amid concerns this could antagonize the Kremlin.
Members also worried about the cost of establishing permanent bases in
the region and carrying out military exercises.

Baltic wishlist

Edward Lucas, a senior fellow at the Center for European Policy
Analysis, said [[Britain is playing a]{.underline}]{.mark} "**[[very
important role]{.underline}]{.mark}**" [[in helping]{.mark} to [sort
the]{.mark}]{.underline} "**[[mess]{.underline}]{.mark}**" [that is
security in the Baltic region]{.underline}. [[The current
situation]{.underline}]{.mark}, he said, [[is characterized
by]{.underline}]{.mark} "[[a]{.mark} **very
[complicated]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[command
structure]{.underline}]{.mark}, a lack of military clout on the ground,
[a lot of **[wishful thinking]{.mark}**]{.underline} [about how things
would sort themselves out in a crisis [and a]{.mark} real [lack
of]{.mark} **[exercises]{.mark}**]{.underline} to tests how things
should actually work."

One reason Britain is well-placed to do this is its leadership of the
Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) of 10 Northern European countries, which
includes non-NATO members such as Finland and Sweden as well as Estonia,
Latvia and Lithuania.

Launched in 2012, the JEF is seen as more agile than NATO and could
provide a rapid response in the first 12 hours should Russia attack one
of its members. Rapid deployment of additional troops in the event of an
attack is crucial for the Baltics, which are close to signing an
agreement among themselves for mobilizing national forces to assist a
fellow Baltic country without waiting for a NATO decision, said Rihards
Kols, chair of the Latvian parliament's foreign relations committee.

Through JEF, Northern European countries have already agreed to carry
out maritime and air exercises.

"[[We see the U.K. as **very important** for our
region]{.underline}]{.mark}," said Kols. "Overall, [the U.K. has shown
**really outstanding**]{.underline} [leadership in this
crisis]{.underline}. We can always say that when it comes to these kinds
of situations, the U.K.'s head is on the right place, on the shoulders."

Gabrielius Landsbergis, Lithuania's minister for foreign affairs, said
[[the Baltic states]{.underline}]{.mark} are approaching the situation
as if they are Western Berlin during the Cold War.

"That means that we [[need]{.underline}]{.mark} ... [**[all the
credibility]{.mark}** to defend the territory as NATO would defend any
other territory in its alliance]{.underline}," he told a U.K.
parliamentary committee last week.

As the most exposed Baltic state, Lithuania has requested a dedicated
strategy, Landsbergis said. It fears [[the Kremlin might attempt to grab
the]{.mark} **[Suwalki gap]{.mark}**]{.underline}, a stretch of land
connecting Russia's Kaliningrad exclave on the Baltic Sea with Belarus.
[[British]{.mark} and Lithuanian [intelligence]{.mark} forces [are now
working]{.mark}]{.underline} together [[to **strengthen** this
area]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[Latvia has asked Britain for more **maritime** and **military
industrial** cooperation]{.underline}, and that aircrafts be placed on
Latvia's military airfields.

Estonia, as the host of a British-led battalion, has seen the number of
British troops doubled in recent weeks, and it has received more
Challenger 2 tanks and armored fighting vehicles from the U.K.

Long way to go

Although NATO has three such battalions in each of the Baltic countries
--- with Britain leading the one stationed in Estonia, Canada leading
another in Latvia and the U.S. heading the group in Lithuania. These are
not intended to withstand a Russian attack but to convey the message to
Moscow that any assault would be an attack against the alliance as a
whole.

"This relies very much on the idea that Russia wouldn't want to kill
Canadians, Germans or Brits," Lucas said. "That's better than nothing
and it worked in Western Berlin during the Cold War. But we don't have
air missile defense for those and we need that. And we don't have the
intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities, and the
maritime strategy that we need."

"Ever since the early 1990s whenever Russia has done something
unacceptable we've done the minimum to confront it at most or nothing
--- and then we thought it would go away," he said. "But every time it
comes back."

Kols said [the Baltics were]{.underline} often [labelled]{.underline}
"**[alarmists]{.underline}**" [by EU partners when they flagged concerns
about Russia]{.underline} in previous years, [[adding cooperation with
Britain is "**paramount**]{.underline}]{.mark}."

Lucas is optimistic that supporting the Baltics is also good for the
Brits, particularly since Brexit.

"[This gets us back into very close cooperation with European
governments]{.underline}," he said. "Looking at it very crudely, it
creates a sort of great pro-British lobby where you've got seven
countries that are really, really keen and grateful for doing the stuff
that we are doing. And that is a good antidote when the French start
making fuss about other things."

#### Exclusion of Britain fails Baltic security.

KL\]

[For]{.underline} centuries [the United Kingdom]{.underline} has played
different roles across Europe, as trading partner, military ally and
deadly adversary. Yet [nowhere has the relationship been more
**prolonged** and **pivotal** than in the Baltic Sea]{.underline}. From
the heights of medieval trade with the region to its role today as a
base for Nato troops, [British interests are **rooted**]{.underline} [in
Europe's north-eastern periphery]{.underline}.

The importance of this relationship is unlikely to wane following
Britain's departure from the European Union. The government claims the
UK will henceforth pursue a destiny called "Global Britain". But
[Britain's links to the rest of Europe will not only continue to be
important, they will become even more so]{.underline}. The EU and the UK
are now each other's most significant neighbour. Britain has a much
larger economy than either Russia and Turkey, and offers a potential
"soft power" challenge to the EU that Vladimir Putin and Recep Tayyip
Erdogan can only dream of.

Most importantly, [Europe, and the Baltic especially, depend on the UK
for **military security**]{.underline}. So it is vital that the two
great unions understand both each other and the geopolitics of the
Baltic Sea and its littoral.

The British-Baltic connection began during the early Middle Ages, when
much of northern and eastern England and Scotland endured Viking raids,
most of which were launched from Denmark. This is when the phrase
"Danegeld" entered the English language, first as a tribute paid to buy
off the attackers, then as a tax levied to fund the defence of the realm
against them. In the later Middle Ages, many eastern British towns, such
as Boston, King's Lynn, Aberdeen and Edinburgh, were partners of the
Hanseatic League, the dominant economic ordering system in the area,
which is sometimes compared with the EU today.

Over the next 300 years, relations between England and Scotland (and
later Great Britain) and the Baltic became more geopolitical. During the
Thirty Years War in the first half of the 17th century, many looked to
the Swedish king Gustavus Adolphus to defend the Protestant cause in
Germany. During the 18th century, the Baltic became a source of critical
naval supplies such as ship masts and hemp. This trade produced its own
tensions. In the 1760s, Catherine the Great of Russia wrote in the
Nakaz, her Enlightenment-inspired legal manifesto, that Britain was
"always exceedingly jealous of the trade carried on with her, and seldom
binds herself by treaties with other states, and depends upon no other
laws than her own". This may sound familiar.

Keeping a hostile power out of the Baltic -- be it the Catholic League
in the Holy Roman empire, Tsarist Russia or France under Napoleon -- was
central to the British national interest. This involved resisting
hostile coalitions such as the first League of Armed Neutrality between
1780 and 1783, an alliance of European naval powers intended to break
Britain's maritime dominance, or the Continental System between 1806 and
1814, which was designed to exclude her from the mainland European
economy.

Throughout this period the power of states such as Sweden and Denmark,
which had previously played international roles well beyond the region,
began to wane. They were caught in the crossfire of the great powers --
for example, when Napoleon forced the Swedes and the Danes to take his
side against London in the Napoleonic Wars. Wisely, the British did not
always react. When, in 1810, Napoleon pressured Sweden into declaring
war on Britain, the Royal Navy commander in the region, Admiral
Saumarez, ignored the challenge.

During the 19th and early 20th centuries, Britain retained a critical
presence in the Baltic. Most of the time, it tried to keep the Russians
-- Tsarist or Soviet -- hemmed in. In 1854, during the Crimean War, the
Royal Navy attacked Russian forts off Finland. After the Russian
Revolution in 1917, British forces were sent to support the new
anti-Bolshevik states -- Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania -- which emerged
from the wreckage. In the first half of the 20th century, the British
sought to keep imperial Germany and the Third Reich boxed into the
Baltic.

In the course of these operations, Britain became a leading security
guarantor of the Baltic states. Estonian independence after 1918 was
assisted by the shelter of Royal Navy guns. The Estonian general Johan
Laidoner, the commander-in-chief of the country's armed forces at the
time, later reflected that, without the arrival of the British fleet in
Tallinn in December 1918, "the fate of our country and our people would
have been very different".

\*\*\*\*

Britain's relationship with the Baltic has also had its problematic,
even traumatic, moments. During the Napoleonic Wars, Britain attacked
Denmark twice, both times with dubious legality and to devastating
effect. In 1801, the Royal Navy destroyed most of the Danish fleet to
prevent it from falling into French hands. Six years later, the British
rammed the point home by attacking Denmark's capital. In the Second
World War, the Royal Air Force wrecked Lübeck and Rostock, two of the
most beautiful German cities in the Baltic.

There were limits to British power. When London was outraged by the
partition of Poland in 1772, British satirists asked whether the navy
would sail up the Vistula from Danzig (modern-day Gdansk) to Warsaw in
order to bring Russia, Prussia and Austria to heel. Bismarck called
Britain's bluff in 1864 when Palmerston threatened to intervene to
support Denmark over Schleswig-Holstein -- the north German principality
disputed between the German and Danish national movements. If the (then
small) British army landed in Germany, Bismarck quipped, he would have
it arrested. And having acted as midwife to the Baltic states in
1918-21, the Royal Navy was unable to prevent the Soviet Union annexing
them in 1940 and again in 1944.

After the Second World War, Britain remained engaged in the Baltic and,
as part of the Nato alliance, was responsible for the defence of the
German line there. The objective was to contain the Soviet Union.

But the UK-Baltic relationship gained a new dimension when the UK joined
the European Economic Community (EEC) in 1973. Economic relations
between Denmark and Britain at that time were so close that the Danes
had little choice but to join on the same day. A psychological element
was in play, too, because British involvement in the EEC provided a
counterweight to what some otherwise regarded as a club of domineering
Germans and shifty Latins.

Over the 47 years of Britain's membership of what became the EU, her
relationship with the Baltic developed along diverging axes. On the one
hand, as the states of the region integrated with the rest of Europe,
the proportion of their trade with Britain declined. On the other hand,
the political, geopolitical and demographic connection grew. Britain was
strongly committed to steady enlargement of the EU to include the states
of the Baltic littoral (Eastern Germany in 1990, Finland and Sweden in
1995 and Poland and the Baltic States in 2004). These countries tended
to cleave to the UK in major EU policy debates and on issues such as
data protection, human rights and criminal justice.

London used these relationships to try to hedge against Franco-German
dominance of the bloc. This was the background to the UK coalition
government's "Northern Future" initiative in 2011.

Furthermore, [Britain was militarily the most important of the European
Nato nations providing armed deterrence in the region]{.underline}.
These links deepened after Putin annexed the Crimea in 2014. Shortly
afterwards, things became further complicated by China's growing
presence in the area. [The People's Liberation Army Navy even conducted
joint exercises with Russia in the Baltic Sea]{.underline} in 2017.
[Britain's defence contribution to the Baltic became even more
significant]{.underline}.

Finally, immigration from the region, especially of Poles, Latvians,
Lithuanians and Estonians, has been notable since 1945, when many
refugees came to work in Britain from those countries. After their
accession to the EU in 2004, the number of immigrants from these states
grew substantially, and this remains the subject of political
controversy.

Then came Brexit. The 2016 referendum was difficult for most Europeans,
but it was particularly traumatic for the strongly Anglophile
Scandinavians and Balts. There are also worries about security and the
strategic ambitions of Putin's Russia, especially in the eastern Baltic.
Is the UK still committed to deterring Russian aggression? Donald
Trump's presidency increased those concerns after he questioned the
relevance of Nato's role in the region.

\*\*\*\*

[The UK's interests in the Baltic today are clear]{.underline}. [They
are to keep the **Russians contained**]{.underline}, tensions with
Brussels down, EU trade links up, [and any future penetration by the
**P**eople's **R**epublic of **C**hina out]{.underline}. The debate over
how to defend these interests formed part of the recent opening of the
Baltic Geopolitics Programme at Cambridge University, launched in
January this year by the president of Estonia Kersti Kaljulaid and Boris
Johnson's foreign policy adviser John Bew.

Where should the UK now draw the military line in the Baltic? In the
past, it has been quite far west, in the Danish Sound, or even in the
approaches to the Baltic. [It would **be far better**]{.underline},
though, [for Britain to maintain its commitment to defending the
democratic countries around the **whole Baltic Sea**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} so to [hold the Russians **as far east** as
possible]{.underline}.

This strategy, however, depends on the assumption that the Baltic
remains friendly territory. The UK's post-Brexit relationship with the
EU will thus be critical. Britain has no interest in undermining the EU
as the principal political and legal ordering system in the Baltic. At
the same time, the UK must ensure the region remains an economically
shared space. [It must not allow the **EU's security
pretensions**]{.underline} ([which]{.underline}, sadly, [is **all that
they are**]{.underline}) [from **disrupting Nato** by
**duplicating**]{.underline} [and **diluting**]{.underline} [capacity
through **additional** European defence structures]{.underline}.

So far, London has not linked its post-Brexit relationship with the EU
to the defence of Europe through Nato by trying, for example, to trade
military protection for trade concessions. If tensions arise over
fishing or access to the single market, it is to be hoped that Britain
will see these as the consequence of Brussels initiatives rather than
reflecting some deeper enmity. Even so, it may become difficult to
explain to the British public why Britain is militarily defending states
dedicated to her economic exclusion, or potentially blocking her access
to vaccines developed by British companies with UK government support,
but produced on the Continent. The question is particularly pertinent
with regard to Denmark, which has taken one of the hardest lines on
fishing, citing "historic rights" going back hundreds of years.

Britain is trying to find its new place in the world at a very difficult
time. The UK's relationship to the EU is unsettled and the Covid
pandemic poses immense challenges; the economy is in the deepest crisis
in modern history and the international situation is in flux, with a new
US president, Germany's election (and Angela Merkel's succession) in
September this year, instability in Russia, and the need for the EU and
Nato to regain the trust of domestic and international publics in their
effectiveness. This may not seem like the best moment to start talking
about Britain's historical ordering role in Europe.

Soon, though, geopolitics will reassert itself. [Britain has
**mattered** and will **continue to matter** in Europe, especially in
the Baltic]{.underline}. [The UK shares with the countries of the Baltic
Sea region commitments to **sustainability**]{.underline}, [particularly
in **energy**]{.underline}, [to the **rule of law** and **human
rights**, to **social stability**]{.underline} [and
**cohesion**]{.underline} [and to excluding **political
extremism**]{.underline}. These common values will matter even more when
the substantial increase in defence expenditure authorised by the
Johnson administration in 2020 takes effect. In the meantime, the UK
should start thinking systematically about its relationship to a vital
part of its own continent.

As [[Canada prepares to accept a]{.mark} **[leadership
role]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[in]{.mark} NATO [operations in
Latvia]{.mark}]{.underline} in 2017, it is apparent that Western powers
prioritize military strength as the primary method to counter Russian
aggression. [Modern security threats are a **nuanced consolidation** of
variables]{.underline}. The dichotomy of 'guns or butter', or the debate
between military force and economic development, is representative of
NATO's mission in the Baltic States.
**[[Canadian-led]{.underline}]{.mark}** military [[forces]{.mark} may
[prevent external Russian incursions]{.mark}]{.underline} but
responsibility rests with the individual Baltic States to rectify any
concerns from ethnic Russian populations within their borders.

[**National security** concerns over Russian diaspora became prominent
once analysts alleged that Russian **hybrid warfare**]{.underline}
[techniques would foment **separatist sentiments** in populations in
Russia's Near Abroad]{.underline}. After the annexation of Crimea and
the ongoing conflict in southeastern Ukraine, such circumstances did not
seem far-fetched. It is assumed that Russia's northern neighbours are
the next targets of its perceived neo-imperialism due to their
relatively small geographic size and substantial ethnic Russian
populations. (Estonia 24 %, Latvia 26 %, and Lithuania 6%)

While NATO membership and aid from fellow members in the Alliance
alleviates external security concerns in the Baltics, internal
difficulties are another matter. Many ethnic Russians are not well
assimilated and there are identifiable ethnic grievances. For instance,
in Latvia, Russian minorities encounter high rates of unemployment,
prejudice, and status as non-citizens. Non-citizens enjoy many of the
same rights as Latvian, citizens but they are ineligible to vote and are
barred from receiving government pensions. Latvian authorities have
attempted to rectify the predicament of non-citizens within its borders
by easing language requirements and costs of citizenship testing.
Nevertheless, ethnic Russians contend costs remain high, especially for
those struggling with unemployment, and thus citizenship remains
unattainable. These accusations increase in potency as Latvia continues
its struggle with Russian language sources of propaganda.

Estonia exhibits similar inequalities, however the outcome is different.
The small Baltic state's ethnic Russians contend with unemployment and
non-citizenship in sizeable numbers, but there is less concern over a
consolidation of Russian diaspora. Russian minorities enjoy a sense of
security, living side by side with their Estonian neighbours, and a
higher standard of living than they would expect in their ethnic
homeland. Further, minorities in Estonia have the opportunity to freely
contest any of the grievances, such as underemployment or wage
disparity, and Estonian media addresses these concerns. In both cases,
this is the point where the butter in the 'guns or butter' dichotomy
takes precedence.

The situation in the Baltics is vastly different from that in Ukraine,
and that should be reflected not only in NATO operations, but also in
how international partners tackle Russian aggression in the region.
Though there are obvious social, economic, and developmental injustices
faced by Russian-speaking populations, these problems have not resulted
in the organization of Russian diaspora and the promotion of separatist
rhetoric. Nevertheless, it is these ethnic grievances that experts
anticipate that the Russian Federation will exploit in order to cause
political dissent and instability. While a Russian invasion into the
Baltics would be an unlikely and imprudent decision, political
instability caused by ethnic grievances of considerable minority
populations is sufficient to destabilize internal politics. Therefore,
it is important for states, such as Estonia and Latvia, to make
investments in assimilating their Russian-speaking populations. It is a
wise strategy to make efforts to alleviate difficulties faced by Russian
'compatriots' living abroad before they become potentially unmanageable
political problems. As well, a higher quality of life and integration
are prime deterrents against Russian propaganda seeking to discredit
Baltic governments.

[[The Canadian contingent's]{.mark} foremost responsibilities are to
**[deter]{.mark}** any signs of [Russian aggression and]{.mark} to
[ensure]{.mark} that the [Baltic]{.mark} States'
**[sovereignty]{.mark}** remains **unchallenged**]{.underline}. This
particular NATO mission will undoubtedly address any concerns regarding
external security. On the other hand, the [**[connections]{.mark}**
[fostered between the]{.mark}]{.underline} applicable [[states and
Canadian envoys offers]{.underline}]{.mark} yet another way to safeguard
**[[regional security]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[Canada has]{.mark}
**[valuable experience]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[in developing
programs]{.mark} that seek [to remedy]{.mark} **[ethnic
grievances]{.mark}**]{.underline} faced by various demographics. For
instance, shared knowledge could result in ways to make citizenship and
language testing more accessible to those non-citizens who wish to
pursue that avenue. As well, economic and educational opportunities for
the underemployed can be profitable. If welcomed, [[Canada can be a
**leader** in **military affairs**]{.underline}]{.mark} [and devising
**socially progressive** ways to cement better **ethnic
relations**]{.underline} in the Baltics. [If these]{.underline}
particular [internal issues are addressed, the anxieties over Russia
using its expatriates to **destabilize**]{.underline} [Estonia, Latvia
and Lithuania **lessen considerably**]{.underline}.

As Canada prepares to lead a major NATO operation in the Baltics,
Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania must consider how they will counter
apparent Russian aggression domestically. Security cannot be achieved by
relying on military strength alone. It will be a finite balancing act of
protecting borders while at the same time charming the hearts and minds
of some long time Russian residents; some lacking in citizenship,
employment and benefits. In the case where ethnic grievances present the
prospect of transforming into a major political issue, social
development must enter into national security planning also. [[Canadian
involvement]{.mark} in the Baltics provides yet another occasion for
Canadian knowledge to **[positively influence]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[European security]{.mark} as well as **long-term** ethnic
relations]{.underline}. In the end, security is not a decision of 'guns
or butter' but rather finding the applicable fusion of both that
addresses the specific needs of a region or state.

### EU-NATO CP\-\--Britain

#### UK says no. Trade fights.

[[The **E**]{.mark}uropean **[U]{.mark}**nion]{.underline}'s chief
Brexit negotiator [signaled the bloc [could impose]{.mark}
**[retaliatory]{.mark} trade [measures]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[on the
UK over its]{.mark} planned [legislation to override]{.mark} parts of
[the withdrawal agreement]{.mark}, [saying the proposal]{.mark}
"**seriously [harmed]{.mark}**" [the bloc's
interests]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Maros Sefcovic told lawmakers in Strasbourg that if the bill put forward
by Boris Johnson's government is adopted as drafted, "of course in that
case we would be forced to use the measures at our disposal, including
the measures" in the Trade and Cooperation Agreement, known as the TCA.

The TCA, which was painstakingly hammered out and signed on Dec. 30,
2020 to allow tariff-free commerce, allows for the partial or full
suspension of benefits in case of a breach of the Withdrawal Agreement
signed between the EU and the UK, including the Northern Ireland
protocol. In that case, [[the EU could **slap tariffs**]{.mark} [on UK
exports]{.mark} to its territory]{.underline}.

Sefcovic said that no alternative solution to the Northern Ireland
protocol, which keeps the area in the EU's single market while creating
a customs border with the rest of the UK, had been found. "And it is not
needed," he added. He reaffirmed that the EU "wishes to have a positive
and stable relationship" with the UK.

The bill put forward by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, which would give
Britain the ability to unilaterally amend the post-Brexit settlement for
Northern Ireland, risks a trade war with [[the EU]{.underline}]{.mark}
and [[has **soured relations** with the UK]{.underline}]{.mark}'s
biggest trading partner. [[The EU]{.mark}
re[launched]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[legal action]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[against the UK]{.underline}]{.mark} last month.

"Our interests, as the other party to the agreement, are seriously
harmed," Sefcovic said of the bill.

The EU's relationship with the UK "must be based on the agreements that
both parties negotiated, agreed and ratified: the Withdrawal Agreement
and the Trade and Cooperation Agreement," Sefcovic said.

### EU-NATO CP\-\--Norway

#### Norway says no.

KL\]

In 1972, the streets of Norway were filled with protests against the EU
when by referendum a majority of Norwegian voters rejected EU
membership. The same situation repeated itself in 1994. [**Throughout
the years**, [opposition against the EU has]{.mark} been
**[dominated]{.mark}**]{.underline} [by [political groups]{.mark} from
the centre-left]{.underline}, and especially by farmers, fishermen, and
workers on the coasts and in the north. These early protests against the
EU reflected, with almost farsighted precision, many of the same topics
discussed today in countries like Portugal, Greece and Ireland: lack of
democracy, lack of economic justice, lack of freedom and independence,
and lack of concerns for the environment.

[According to [the Norwegian movement against the
EU]{.mark}]{.underline} (Neitil EU), [which [has been active for]{.mark}
the **past [four decades]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [the main reasons for
remaining an independent nation are as follows]{.underline}:

1.  Democracy. The authority of ever new areas is transferred from the
    nation states to the EU. The citizens of the EU are rarely aware of
    what is happening behind the closed doors of Brussels. Consequently,
    only around 45 percent of the people of the EU participate in
    elections. As an independent nation, Norway has a better
    participatory democracy.

2.  **[[Solidarity]{.underline}]{.mark}**: As a strong force in the
    World Trade Organization (WTO), [the EU is **pressuring poor
    countries** into allowing multinational companies to set up
    shop]{.underline}. [The EU also enters into **unfair trade
    agreements** with **former colonies**]{.underline} [and has reduced
    its aid to poor countries in Africa]{.underline}. The EU pressures
    poor countries to accept liberalization and privatization of the
    economy.

3.  **[Environment]{.underline}**. [The EU is not effectively helping to
    solve the world's environmental problems]{.underline}, such as
    global warming. [The EU's economic policies leads to
    **centralization** and large]{.underline} --[scale]{.underline}
    production resulting in [**overconsumption** of
    resources]{.underline}, increased transport and pollution. [The EU
    has]{.underline} [proven]{.underline} to be ineffective in solving
    global environmental issues and [**too big** and
    **cumbersome**]{.underline} [to solve local issues]{.underline}.

4.  Freedom. After the signing of the Lisbon Treaty much of [EU foreign
    policy decisions are taken during **elite political
    dinners**]{.underline} in Brussels [and]{.underline} these
    [decisions are increasingly favouring **rich countries** over the
    poor]{.underline}. Before membership, Sweden used to vote for the
    interests of the south in the UN, but as an EU member, Sweden rarely
    does so. As an outsider, Norway can remain an independent voice in
    the world.

Two themes have been fundamental to Norwegians against membership in the
EU since the Treatise of Rome was signed in 1957: 1) the perception that
democratic values at the national as well as the local level are best
retained outside the EU, and 2) skepticism towards the market liberalism
embedded in the EU constitution. As we have noted above, these concerns
have become increasingly prevalent in new member countries, as well,
especially those at the periphery of power in Brussels, and in those
countries suffering the most from the Euro crisis, such as Portugal and
Spain.

[According to the]{.underline} '**[No to EU]{.underline}**' [movement in
Norway, the EU has largely designed a society]{.underline}
"[where]{.underline} local and national [communities are replaced by
**companies**]{.underline} [and **banks**]{.underline} as the
fundamental building blocks." [[This]{.mark} popular [movement has been
supported by the]{.mark} **[majority]{.mark}** [of Norwegians]{.mark}
over the years [and has been]{.mark} **[very
critical]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[of the]{.mark} fundamentals in the
[EU]{.mark}'s economic program]{.underline}, namely the four economic
freedoms mentioned above. These neoliberal policies, it is argued,
restrict local authorities and states from the right "to limit the
market freedoms if it is necessary in order to achieve important social
purposes." In other words, this movement has, from its very inception in
the early 1970s, pointed directly to the heart of EUs weak links as an
economic and social Union, namely its tendency to centralize and
monopolize both economic and political power.

According to the No to EU movement, "The Norwegian Parliament, like
Westminster \[in Great Britain\], is far from the individual voter:
Brussels, however, is much farther away and too detached from democratic
control. If we want politics based on solidarity values, and if we wish
to take the people with us on that endeavour, we must begin at the level
where democratic power is real. This is a thesis of equal significance
to both Britain and Norway." Indeed, similar concerns are echoed amongst
EU sceptics all over Europe today, from Ireland to Portugal.

If NATO wants to deny Russia the ability to successfully attack one or
more Baltic states, it has little choice but to deploy forces on a much
larger scale than it currently does. Such forces could be deployed
gradually to avoid giving Russia a casus belli and to make such
deployments more palatable to skeptical NATO members. [The]{.underline}
2017 RAND study [proposed [deployments]{.mark} of]{.underline} around
35,000 personnel, with [an additional reinforcement capability of up to
about **70,000** personnel]{.underline};1 this would certainly prevent a
Russian military fait accompli and force Moscow to fight a bloody and
drawn-out conventional war, should it attack. These deployments would
also, perhaps, eliminate most of the difficulties---and some of the
resulting escalation pathways---that stem from the alliance's current
need to reinforce troops rapidly and on a large scale in a crisis. In
addition, these troop deployments would raise the costs to Moscow of
deliberately forcing a military crisis with NATO.

[While such measures **[might]{.mark}** [mitigate the short-term]{.mark}
risk of deliberate Russian escalation, [they would create]{.mark} a
number of **[severe]{.mark}**]{.underline} political
**[[trade-offs]{.underline}]{.mark}**. First, a
[[deterrence]{.underline}]{.mark}-by-denial approach [[would
risk]{.mark} **[overstretching]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[the
**delicate**]{.mark} **political [consensus]{.mark}** [among
NATO]{.mark} members [about **conventional** deterrence]{.mark} and
assurance]{.underline}. A number of [member states]{.underline}, perhaps
[led by [**Germany** and **France**]{.mark}, would not support such a
policy and [would seek to **block it**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Even more
importantly, perhaps, [[not even the Baltic states]{.mark} are
[support]{.mark}ive [of such a]{.mark} **[maximalist
approach]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[While]{.underline}]{.mark} many
[[Baltic officials]{.mark} and experts [would like to see **greater
U.S.**]{.mark} **military** [engagement]{.mark}]{.underline} in the
region, some of them are highly skeptical of the assumptions underlying
the RAND war games and think that they are too pessimistic about Baltic
defenses. While they would like to see a strong, unified allied response
to the growing threat from Russia, [[they]{.mark} also [recognize the
need to avoid]{.mark} **unnecessarily [escalating]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[general [tensions]{.mark} with Russia]{.underline}.2 Also, against the
background of often contentious debates within NATO about financial and
military burden sharing, it would not be clear at all who would provide
the necessary funds and forces for such a large military footprint.
Neither the United States nor most other allies currently seem to be
both willing and capable.

Second, instead of preventing deliberate Russian escalation [[this
deterrence]{.underline}]{.mark}-by-denial approach
[[could]{.underline}]{.mark}, in fact,
**[[reinforce]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[Russian perceptions of
**insecurity**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Russia would be **loath**]{.mark}
[to accept a NATO force]{.mark} that size]{.underline} **[[so
close]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[to its borders]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[[Moscow]{.mark} might seek to [prevent]{.mark} NATO force [deployments
through]{.mark}]{.underline} various means, including, not
inconceivably, by considering [the **preventive [use of
force]{.mark}**]{.underline} (that is, [[Russia might **wage a
war**]{.mark} [because it could]{.mark} only [see its position
**deteriorating**]{.mark} in the future]{.underline}). [This risk might
become more acute in the early stages of a crisis when [Russia
could]{.mark} **[misinterpret]{.mark}** [the **large-scale
movement**]{.mark} of sizable forces]{.underline}, such as the 70,000
personnel reinforcement the RAND study suggested, [[as NATO preparations
for a **preemptive attack**]{.mark} on Russia]{.underline}. Third,
[large-scale conventional [deployments]{.mark} could help **further
[solidify]{.mark}** [Russian reliance on its]{.mark} **[nuclear
deterrent]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and could]{.mark} even serve to
[lower Russia's threshold]{.mark} for nuclear use, [making]{.mark} the
**[early employment]{.mark}** of nuclear weapons more
[likely]{.mark}]{.underline}.

As outlined, [the RAND scenario leaves NATO with a series of **bad
options**]{.underline}. To deter Russia from such a gambit, the Alliance
could deploy ground forces forward in sufficient numbers to defend the
Baltics. To this end, the U.S. Army has begun rotating brigade combat
teams through the Baltics, and NATO has developed what it calls the Very
High Readiness Joint Task Force, a rapid reinforcement capability in the
Baltics in the event of a major crisis.4 However, under most likely
scenarios, [[deploying]{.mark} additional conventional ground
[forces]{.mark} to the Baltics for forward defense [is]{.mark}
**[problematic]{.mark}**]{.underline}, even if they could arrive in time
and in sufficient numbers. First, [[it remains
**unclear**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[whether these forces would have
the]{.mark} intended [deterrent effect]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[They]{.underline}]{.mark} might instead **[[escalate
tensions]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[and **stoke**]{.mark} **Russian
[aggression]{.mark}** because [Moscow]{.mark} seems likely to
[view]{.mark} additional NATO [forces]{.mark} in the Baltics [as a
threat to **Kaliningrad** and]{.mark} perhaps **[St.
Petersburg]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Second, although additional
conventional Alliance forces in the Baltics would undoubtedly drive up
the costs of conventional attack by Russia, [[the entire region is
one]{.mark} **[gigantic kill zone]{.mark}**]{.underline} [where [Russia
could immediately target]{.mark} NATO forces]{.underline} at the onset
of hostilities, [including **[vulnerable]{.mark}** assembly areas,
[supplies]{.mark}, and fuel stocks]{.underline}. [[Russian
attacks]{.mark}]{.underline} emanating [through
Kaliningrad]{.underline}, [from Russia]{.underline} itself, [over the
sea]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} likely [from Belarus
would]{.underline} almost **[certainly]{.underline}**
[[render]{.underline}]{.mark} additional [prepositioned [NATO forces

KL\]

Primarily, the challenge facing NATO is dealing with the possibility of
Russia using the Baltics as a way to test the credibility of the NATO
alliance. [[The Baltic states]{.underline}]{.mark} of Latvia, Lithuania,
and Estonia [[currently rely on NATO's]{.mark} enhanced **[forward
presence]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} **[air policing]{.mark}** missions [to
deter Russia]{.mark}n aggression]{.underline}. [[But this provides
only]{.mark} **[short term]{.mark}** [reassurance]{.mark}]{.underline}
to the region and overlooks the lessons of the Cold War in which West
Germany played a vital role in the credibility of NATO's deterrence
posture. The reluctance of Germany to think seriously about the military
security of Europe is, therefore, becoming a hindrance to NATO's
deterrence capabilities. Germany has repeatedly emphasized its aversion
to militarism in recent years and its military has faced numerous bouts
of austerity. But this reluctance to be seen as a military power
overlooks the role of the West German Bundeswehr which acted as the
first line of NATO's defense in the Cold War.

The history of the Cold War provides clues to how deterrence could be
increased in the Baltic region today. The defense and deterrence
capability of West Germany revolved not just around the nuclear
deterrent, but on the ability of the United States and its allies to
deploy forces quickly. This related to the logistic capabilities to move
forces quickly to the border with East Germany. An important part of
NATO strategy therefore relied on the West German autobahns as a way to
move both goods and people. Today, the Baltic region lacks any
meaningful infrastructure in which reinforcements could be moved quickly
to the region. Train lines are outdated and travel between the Baltics
to Poland or further to Germany is painstakingly slow. [[The Baltic
states]{.mark} also [do not have]{.mark} any significant [capabilities
to host allied forces in **large**]{.mark} **scale
[numbers]{.mark}**]{.underline}, particularly [[as access to the
area]{.mark} in a conflict scenario [would be limited due to
Russian]{.mark} **[air superiority]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and]{.mark}
**[anti-access]{.mark}**, **[area-denial]{.mark}**
[capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[The]{.mark} **large
[placement]{.mark}** [of U.S. forces]{.mark} in this **sensitive area**
[would]{.mark} no doubt [invite]{.mark}
**[reprisals]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and]{.mark}
**[escalation]{.mark}** [from Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}. But showing
the capabilities to quickly respond to a crisis by having the capacity
to move resources to the region would enhance NATO's deterrence in the
long term. NATO should therefore consider developing its forces in
Germany and even Poland, but with the added caveat of being able to move
these forces quickly to where they are needed in the Baltics.

divisions, which is not the case currently.

BALTBAT -- why not Baltic Division?

From time to time, people refer to BALTBAT project and ask why the
Baltic states have not used it as an example and created a Baltic
brigade or even a division. To put it very simply, BALTBAT project
cannot be considered as an example for creating a joint force, and
[[forming a Baltic division is]{.mark} **[much more
complicated]{.mark}** [than it seems]{.mark}]{.underline}.

BALTBAT was founded and designed for peacekeeping missions. The format
was chosen not to provoke Russia. Thereby western countries, especially
the Nordic countries, were able to equip, train, and develop Baltic
militaries in the western way (Ito, 2013 pp. 245-246). The focus solely
on peace support operations deviated BALTBAT from the rest of the
defence forces and the expertise was not spread among the militaries as
intensely as it was desired (Ito, 2013 pp. 254-255). 'BALTBAT was seen
more as a tool for gaining NATO membership and interoperability than as
a specific defence capability' (Grant, et al., 2019 p. 19). Being closed
already before 2004, BALTBAT has been activated three more times to
contribute NRF. Currently, since 2021, the project has been suspended
(Times, 2020).

[[The Baltic states]{.mark} have [**never** had a desire to have a joint
force]{.mark} to defend the Baltic states as a region]{.underline}. The
idea of creating the "Baltic state military union" was rejected at the
very beginning of the 90s (Molis, 2009 p. 29). The Baltic states became
busy to build their own countries and probably were not ready for such
level cooperation. In other words, there was lack of strategic thinking
and leadership at that time. There is also another and maybe simpler
reason for the absence of cooperation: from the distance [the Baltic
states]{.underline} may look similar, but they [are]{.underline}
actually **[very different]{.underline}**. '[**History** and **[cultural
identity]{.mark}**, history of the statehood, **[language]{.mark}**,

and NATO collective defence commitments are similar' (Andžāns, et al.,

of militaries (Nikers, et al., 2019). Estonia has followed 'a compulsory
military service and a reservist army, Latvia has opted a solely
professional army with a considerably smaller amount of supporting
manpower' (Andžāns, et al., 2017 pp. 29- 30). Lithuania re-established
conscription in 2015 and started to use a mixed model relying mainly on
professional force, 'the conscript ratio of the total force structure is
and will remain relatively small' (Jermalavičius, 2017). [As independent

Unfortunately, [these [investments do not]{.mark} go far enough to
[fill]{.mark}]{.underline} the seams created by
**[[deficiencies]{.underline}]{.mark}** in previous acquisition
decisions. [While the department has made a significant investment in
fifth-generation stealth strike fighter **[aircraft]{.mark}**,
[none]{.mark} of them [have **sufficient range**]{.mark} [to reach their
targets without]{.mark} the assistance of large]{.underline} "[big
wing]{.underline}" [[tankers]{.mark}, [which are susceptible to]{.mark}
attack from enemy [A2/AD]{.mark} systems, [a **critical
vulnerability**]{.mark}]{.underline}.10 Attempts to pair these aircraft
with [[long-range missiles]{.underline}]{.mark} with sufficient range to
reach deep into A2/AD "bubbles" to reach critical strategic targets
[[are hampered]{.underline}]{.mark} both [[by slow development of
**modern** weapons]{.underline}]{.mark} to replace Tomahawk cruise
missiles based on 1970s-era designs and by a lack of capacity within the
defense industrial base [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the logistics supply
chain to keep forward shooters well supplied during high-tempo combat
operations.11 Additionally, there are [**[command and control]{.mark}**
[difficulties]{.mark} associated with missile control after launch
in]{.underline} competitive spectrum and **[[cyber
environments]{.underline}]{.mark}**.12

Perhaps most concerning to planners is that the U.S. Navy's carrier
aviation arm, composed of 11 supercarriers and 10 accompanying air wings
of approximately 60 aircraft, is not optimized to execute long-range
penetrating strike missions. The carriers, given their size and
electronic emissions, are vulnerable to attack by antiship ballistic and
cruise missiles and hence are restricted to operating in excess of 1,000
nautical miles (nm) from enemy shore.13 Air wing aircraft, largely
consisting of **[F]{.underline}**/A-**[18]{.underline}** C/D/E/F Hornets
[and **F-35**]{.underline}C Lightning II [aircraft]{.underline}, which
have unrefueled ranges of 500nm and 630nm respectively, [are unable to
reach enemy targets without tanking]{.underline}.14 As mentioned
previously, large Air Force "big wing" tankers are too vulnerable to
penetrate A2/AD bubbles, and the Navy currently lacks sufficient organic
mission tanking to effectively extend the range of the air wing.15
Oddly, naval [[aviation]{.underline}]{.mark} has consistently either
**[[fumbled]{.underline}]{.mark}** or bypassed opportunities to develop
new longrange strike [[aircraft that could maintain]{.underline}]{.mark}
the [[relevance]{.underline}]{.mark} of the carrier itself [[in future

#### NATO says no\-\--internal politics

[Since the beginning of EU-NATO cooperation]{.underline}, [there have
been obstacles]{.underline} that have hindered the optimalisation of
cooperation, [leading to sub-optimal outcomes]{.underline}. Some
obstacles are age-old, others have emerged over time as a result of the
changing security environment.

[The first]{.underline} and most important obstacle to further
cooperation [is]{.underline} the **[organisations' difference in member
states]{.underline}**. [Although there is]{.underline} quite some
[overlap]{.underline} -- 21 states are both a member of the EU and NATO
[-- there are also EU countries that are not a NATO member and vice
versa]{.underline}. The [differences in membership are especially an
obstacle]{.underline} **[when it comes to sharing more sensitive
security-related information]{.underline}**. It is common that some
[states only want to share information with either the EU or NATO, but
**not with both**.]{.underline} Bruno Lété of the German Marshall Fund
of the United States describes this as follows: "(...) the [EU and NATO
nevertheless remain two separate]{.underline} [bodies]{.underline}, and
[each uphold]{.underline} **[restrictive
information-sharing]{.underline}** **[procedures]{.underline}** [that
prevent the emergence of a culture of shared]{.underline} situational
awareness or [cyber threat
assessment]{.underline}."﻿[\[75\]](https://www.clingendael.org/pub/2021/countering-hybrid-threats/3-eu-nato-cooperation-what-has-been-achieved-so-far/)

In practice, this problem is sometimes solved through sharing
information only between EU and NATO staff, explicitly mentioning that
information cannot be shared with representatives from member states. In
such situations, NATO and EU staff are able to cooperate on the basis of
this information, while at the same time individual member states do not
receive the classified information. This way of information sharing has
enabled the EU and NATO to circumvent certain (political)
obstacles.﻿[\[76\]](https://www.clingendael.org/pub/2021/countering-hybrid-threats/3-eu-nato-cooperation-what-has-been-achieved-so-far/) So
far, this construction has worked for EU and NATO staff, but if [joint
EU-NATO]{.underline} follow-up action would be required, the
[involvement of member states **cannot be avoided**]{.underline} and
**[political obstacles]{.underline}** would then still
**[prevail]{.underline}**. Moreover, the [absence of a secure
communication system]{.underline} sometimes also [makes this very
difficult]{.underline}. [**Even if there is a willingness** among EU and
NATO staff]{.underline} to share sensitive or classified information,
[there is no quick and easy communication system to share this
information]{.underline}. [Moreover, the EU's and NATO's standards and
practices in securing information **also
diverge**]{.underline}﻿[\[77\]](https://www.clingendael.org/pub/2021/countering-hybrid-threats/3-eu-nato-cooperation-what-has-been-achieved-so-far/),
[which further complicate matters]{.underline}. Therefore, this
possibility of circumventing the (political) obstacles is no sustainable
solution for the long term.

## EU\-\--Canada

#### Canada is key to the Baltics.

**Canada Can Help**]{.underline}]{.mark}\"; NATO Association of Canada
Association (NAOC);
https://natoassociation.ca/guns-versus-butter-in-the-baltics-how-canada-can-help/;
KL\]

As [[Canada prepares to accept a]{.mark} **[leadership
role]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[in]{.mark} NATO [operations in
Latvia]{.mark}]{.underline} in 2017, it is apparent that Western powers
prioritize military strength as the primary method to counter Russian
aggression. [Modern security threats are a **nuanced consolidation** of
variables]{.underline}. The dichotomy of 'guns or butter', or the debate
between military force and economic development, is representative of
NATO's mission in the Baltic States.
**[[Canadian-led]{.underline}]{.mark}** military [[forces]{.mark} may
[prevent external Russian incursions]{.mark}]{.underline} but
responsibility rests with the individual Baltic States to rectify any
concerns from ethnic Russian populations within their borders.

[**National security** concerns over Russian diaspora became prominent
once analysts alleged that Russian **hybrid warfare**]{.underline}
[techniques would foment **separatist sentiments** in populations in
Russia's Near Abroad]{.underline}. After the annexation of Crimea and
the ongoing conflict in southeastern Ukraine, such circumstances did not
seem far-fetched. It is assumed that Russia's northern neighbours are
the next targets of its perceived neo-imperialism due to their
relatively small geographic size and substantial ethnic Russian
populations. (Estonia 24 %, Latvia 26 %, and Lithuania 6%)

While NATO membership and aid from fellow members in the Alliance
alleviates external security concerns in the Baltics, internal
difficulties are another matter. Many ethnic Russians are not well
assimilated and there are identifiable ethnic grievances. For instance,
in Latvia, Russian minorities encounter high rates of unemployment,
prejudice, and status as non-citizens. Non-citizens enjoy many of the
same rights as Latvian, citizens but they are ineligible to vote and are
barred from receiving government pensions. Latvian authorities have
attempted to rectify the predicament of non-citizens within its borders
by easing language requirements and costs of citizenship testing.
Nevertheless, ethnic Russians contend costs remain high, especially for
those struggling with unemployment, and thus citizenship remains
unattainable. These accusations increase in potency as Latvia continues
its struggle with Russian language sources of propaganda.

Estonia exhibits similar inequalities, however the outcome is different.
The small Baltic state's ethnic Russians contend with unemployment and
non-citizenship in sizeable numbers, but there is less concern over a
consolidation of Russian diaspora. Russian minorities enjoy a sense of
security, living side by side with their Estonian neighbours, and a
higher standard of living than they would expect in their ethnic
homeland. Further, minorities in Estonia have the opportunity to freely
contest any of the grievances, such as underemployment or wage
disparity, and Estonian media addresses these concerns. In both cases,
this is the point where the butter in the 'guns or butter' dichotomy
takes precedence.

The situation in the Baltics is vastly different from that in Ukraine,
and that should be reflected not only in NATO operations, but also in
how international partners tackle Russian aggression in the region.
Though there are obvious social, economic, and developmental injustices
faced by Russian-speaking populations, these problems have not resulted
in the organization of Russian diaspora and the promotion of separatist
rhetoric. Nevertheless, it is these ethnic grievances that experts
anticipate that the Russian Federation will exploit in order to cause
political dissent and instability. While a Russian invasion into the
Baltics would be an unlikely and imprudent decision, political
instability caused by ethnic grievances of considerable minority
populations is sufficient to destabilize internal politics. Therefore,
it is important for states, such as Estonia and Latvia, to make
investments in assimilating their Russian-speaking populations. It is a
wise strategy to make efforts to alleviate difficulties faced by Russian
'compatriots' living abroad before they become potentially unmanageable
political problems. As well, a higher quality of life and integration
are prime deterrents against Russian propaganda seeking to discredit
Baltic governments.

[[The Canadian contingent's]{.mark} foremost responsibilities are to
**[deter]{.mark}** any signs of [Russian aggression and]{.mark} to
[ensure]{.mark} that the [Baltic]{.mark} States'
**[sovereignty]{.mark}** remains **unchallenged**]{.underline}. This
particular NATO mission will undoubtedly address any concerns regarding
external security. On the other hand, the [**[connections]{.mark}**
[fostered between the]{.mark}]{.underline} applicable [[states and
Canadian envoys offers]{.underline}]{.mark} yet another way to safeguard
**[[regional security]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[Canada has]{.mark}
**[valuable experience]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[in developing
programs]{.mark} that seek [to remedy]{.mark} **[ethnic
grievances]{.mark}**]{.underline} faced by various demographics. For
instance, shared knowledge could result in ways to make citizenship and
language testing more accessible to those non-citizens who wish to
pursue that avenue. As well, economic and educational opportunities for
the underemployed can be profitable. If welcomed, [[Canada can be a
**leader** in **military affairs**]{.underline}]{.mark} [and devising
**socially progressive** ways to cement better **ethnic
relations**]{.underline} in the Baltics. [If these]{.underline}
particular [internal issues are addressed, the anxieties over Russia
using its expatriates to **destabilize**]{.underline} [Estonia, Latvia
and Lithuania **lessen considerably**]{.underline}.

As Canada prepares to lead a major NATO operation in the Baltics,
Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania must consider how they will counter
apparent Russian aggression domestically. Security cannot be achieved by
relying on military strength alone. It will be a finite balancing act of
protecting borders while at the same time charming the hearts and minds
of some long time Russian residents; some lacking in citizenship,
employment and benefits. In the case where ethnic grievances present the
prospect of transforming into a major political issue, social
development must enter into national security planning also. [[Canadian
involvement]{.mark} in the Baltics provides yet another occasion for
Canadian knowledge to **[positively influence]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[European security]{.mark} as well as **long-term** ethnic
relations]{.underline}. In the end, security is not a decision of 'guns
or butter' but rather finding the applicable fusion of both that
addresses the specific needs of a region or state.

**[retaliatory]{.mark} trade [measures]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[on the

[the withdrawal agreement]{.mark}, [saying the proposal]{.mark}
"**seriously [harmed]{.mark}**" [the bloc's
interests]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Maros Sefcovic told lawmakers in Strasbourg that if the bill put forward
by Boris Johnson's government is adopted as drafted, "of course in that
case we would be forced to use the measures at our disposal, including
the measures" in the Trade and Cooperation Agreement, known as the TCA.

The TCA, which was painstakingly hammered out and signed on Dec. 30,
2020 to allow tariff-free commerce, allows for the partial or full
suspension of benefits in case of a breach of the Withdrawal Agreement
signed between the EU and the UK, including the Northern Ireland
protocol. In that case, [[the EU could **slap tariffs**]{.mark} [on UK
exports]{.mark} to its territory]{.underline}.

Sefcovic said that no alternative solution to the Northern Ireland
protocol, which keeps the area in the EU's single market while creating
a customs border with the rest of the UK, had been found. "And it is not
needed," he added. He reaffirmed that the EU "wishes to have a positive
and stable relationship" with the UK.

The bill put forward by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, which would give
Britain the ability to unilaterally amend the post-Brexit settlement for
Northern Ireland, risks a trade war with [[the EU]{.underline}]{.mark}
and [[has **soured relations** with the UK]{.underline}]{.mark}'s
biggest trading partner. [[The EU]{.mark}
re[launched]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[legal action]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[against the UK]{.underline}]{.mark} last month.

"Our interests, as the other party to the agreement, are seriously
harmed," Sefcovic said of the bill.

The EU's relationship with the UK "must be based on the agreements that
both parties negotiated, agreed and ratified: the Withdrawal Agreement
and the Trade and Cooperation Agreement," Sefcovic said.

#### Hotlines encourage [risky]{.underline} behavior.

The increasing reliance of the US and Russia on military deconfliction
channels to sort out confrontational relations between them, however,
should be seen as buying time for diplomatic tracks to manage and
eventually solve the conflict. Whilst **[[military
hotlines]{.underline}]{.mark}** are essential to avoid misunderstanding
and escalation precipitating a conflict between two nuclear-armed
military powers, they also might [[change the incentives for
**aggressive**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[and **risky**
behaviour]{.underline}]{.mark} in the international arena if [[they are
perceived to be **reducing**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[the need for]{.mark}
**diplomatic dialogue**]{.underline} [and [**genuine risk reduction**

and written letters as Russia's invasion of Ukraine has spread further
west toward NATO territory, senior NATO military officials said on
Wednesday.

"We are trying to communicate with them of course," one of the officials
told reporters in a briefing at NATO headquarters. "But [it requires
**two**]{.underline} \[**[sides]{.underline}**\] [to

The officials' comments followed Russia's attacks on a Ukrainian
military base earlier this week just 10 miles from the Polish border,
which raised concerns about the conflict potentially spilling over into
a NATO member country.

[is]{.underline} **[our neighbor]{.underline}** [and represents
the]{.underline} **[strongest]{.underline}** [permanent military
presence]{.underline} in our part of the High North. This is unlikely to
change overnight, and [Russia will]{.underline} thus
[remain]{.underline} "[the]{.underline} **[defining
factor]{.underline}** [of Norwegian defense]{.underline} planning in the
foreseeable future."5 [[Russia is]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[occupying
a]{.underline}]{.mark} [gradually **[more
prominent]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[place]{.mark} on the competitive
stage]{.underline}, [[challenging]{.underline} **[western
dominance]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[allied
coherency]{.underline}**]{.mark}. So [amidst the]{.underline}
(re-)**[emergence]{.underline}** [of great power
competition]{.underline}, [[Norway is]{.underline}]{.mark} also
**[predicated]{.underline}** [[to take a]{.underline} **[greater
responsibility]{.underline}** [for deterrence]{.underline}]{.mark} prior
to aggression. Not necessarily because the relationship with Russia is
set to deteriorate, but due to "growing uncertainty surrounding allied
support to Norway in the most likely crisis scenarios."6

Preserving regional (and global) stability is paramount for Norway's
security. **[Historically]{.underline}**, [Norway's relations with
Russia]{.underline} have [consisted of a]{.underline} [**delicate
balance** of deterrence through NATO membership and
**reassurance**]{.underline} [through]{.underline}
**[self-imposed]{.underline}** military and nuclear
[restraints]{.underline}, diplomacy, and cooperation whenever possible.
[[**Reassurance** might be]{.mark} described as [a]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[Norwegian]{.underline} **[strategic niche]{.underline}**]{.mark}.
[[Before the]{.underline} **[Baltic countries]{.underline}**]{.mark}
became members of NATO, [[Norway was the]{.underline} **[only
NATO]{.underline}**]{.mark} [[country]{.mark} [that bordered
Russia]{.mark}.]{.underline} General Philip Breedlove (former Supreme
Allied Commander Europe \[SACEUR\]) describes Norway's strategic role
this way: "In NATO, [[we see **Norway's
leadership**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[in]{.mark} the way it]{.underline}
**[handles relations]{.underline}** [with [Russia]{.mark}.]{.underline}
[[Norway has a]{.underline} **[long history]{.underline}**]{.mark} [[of
working]{.mark} [with Russia]{.mark} [in]{.mark}]{.underline} the
**[[border areas]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[You have
experience]{.mark}s]{.underline} that [we can]{.underline} **[learn
from]{.underline}** in NATO."7

However, given the immense military asymmetry between Norway and Russia,
Norway is not able to generate any (significant) regional deterrent
effect on its own. Thus, Norway is dependent on NATO regional and global
deterrence capability to credibly succeed in deterring Russia. The
reliance on NATO still complicates the value of deterrence -- in the
same manner as deterring a bully through having an older cousin that
knows karate has it apparent limitations. [[The]{.underline}
**[old]{.underline}**]{.mark}, [[and friendly]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[relationship between the two]{.underline}]{.mark} neighbors
[[is]{.mark} thus]{.underline} **[not only]{.underline}**
[convenient]{.underline}, [but a]{.underline}
**[[necessary]{.underline}]{.mark}** [and]{.underline}
**[complementary]{.underline}** [security]{.underline} and stability
[tool]{.underline}. For NATO [this]{.underline} also [has]{.underline}
**[obvious value]{.underline}**; a more bellicose ally on the
northeastern frontier could certainly create some predicaments for the
alliance. As it stands, [Norway offers a]{.underline}
**[stable]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[predictable]{.underline}**
[partner for both parties]{.underline} -- [thereby
**[extending]{.mark}** the value of [reassurance to]{.mark}]{.underline}
the relationship between [[Russia and NATO]{.underline} **[as a
whole]{.underline}**]{.mark}.

[Norway's contribution of reassurance]{.underline} **[is
valuable]{.underline}**, but that can hardly be seen as a sufficient
contribution in an alliance. At least from a realist perspective, such
soft power contributions are not far from "free riding." The reliance on
"deterrence by proxy" requires commitments and investments in a more
profound way. [Norway **contributes** with niche reassurance
capability]{.underline}, [is]{.underline} just [above the]{.underline}
NATO [2% GDP target,]{.underline}8 [and has shown]{.underline}
**[will]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[ability]{.underline}** [to
work closely with]{.underline} [allied strategic resources]{.underline}
[to demonstrate]{.underline} its [deterrence]{.underline} capability.9
While these (and more) are important lines of operations, Norway must
also seek to maintain and offer relevant capabilities to fulfill
international expectations in other alliance-endeavors. In support of
global peace and security [NATO]{.underline} must have "the military
capacity to undertake crisis management operations alone,10" and this
[requires]{.underline} **[active participation]{.underline}** -- also
[from]{.underline} **[small states]{.underline}**. [In a time
where]{.underline} **[alliance cohesion]{.underline}** [is being
challenged,]{.underline} [military and security]{.underline}
"**[[protectionism]{.underline}]{.mark}**" [[is
counterproductive]{.mark}.]{.underline} An overly inwards focus to the
detriment of supporting other campaigns may both undermine national
political capital and the alliance itself. [[Norwegian
politicians]{.underline}]{.mark} and flag-officers will do well to keep
in mind that the performance of the alliance along the entire conflict
spectrum is [[essential]{.mark} both [for]{.mark} [cohesion and
the]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[perception]{.underline}** [of
deterrence]{.underline}]{.mark} that can be generated.
"**[Ultimately]{.underline}**, [NATO's strength and value lies in
the]{.underline} **[unity]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[interoperability]{.underline}** [of its members]{.underline}."11

Deterrence through proxy -- Investing correctly in a strong alliance

In one way or another Norway has a long history of investing in
security, both close and "out-of-area." Early Norwegian international
military engagements after World War II focused mainly on reconstruction
in Europe. In parallel, Norway engaged itself in UN (and otherwise)-led
peace operations, from United Nations Emergency Force (UNEF) in 1956
until present day. When the global war on terror kicked off, Norway
refocused its effort and initiated two decades of Norwegian alliance-
and coalition-engagements abroad. [Through its]{.underline}
**[engagements]{.underline}**, [Norway has sought to be]{.underline}
both [an]{.underline} **[altruistic]{.underline}** [team-player on the
world stage and a]{.underline} **[loyal]{.underline}** [alliance
member]{.underline}. With the (re-)emergence of great power competition,
these efforts have taken a back seat in the security discourse --
presenting Norway and its allies a di- and occasionally tri-lemma.

Analysis suggests that in the midst of a new and more competitive
normal, rather than merely refocusing at home -- shutting the windows
and locking the door -- the relevance of using military means abroad in
a globalized world will only increase. Beadle and Diesen suggest this is
valid regardless of changes in the threat at home. 12 [The]{.underline}
**[interconnectedness]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} all [actors makes
it **difficult to isolate**]{.underline} both [the problem
and]{.underline} the [solution]{.underline}
[geographically]{.underline}. The dilemma is that, although one
acknowledges the need for allied solidarity in coping with global
threats to secure a vital and effective alliance, there is also a strong
urge to strengthen national defense. If you add the increasing military
costs, you might end up as Norway has tended to -- reducing size and
refocusing on national defense.13 This might be well in line with the
core task of collective defense in NATO's Strategic Concept, but to the
detriment of the remaining two core tasks of crisis management and
cooperative security.14

[[Estonia sees Turkey as a **good NATO ally**]{.underline}]{.mark} [with
**high capabilities**]{.underline}, which understands its security
concerns very well, [[the country\'s]{.mark} **[F]{.mark}**oreign
**[M]{.mark}**inister]{.underline} Eva-Maria Liimets
[[said]{.underline}]{.mark} Friday.

Speaking to Anadolu Agency (AA) during her official visit to Turkey,
Liimets said that the [bilateral relations between the two countries are
**evolving**]{.underline} every year and said: \"[Estonia and Turkey are
two **very good allies** in NATO]{.underline}.\"

Noting that the [relations between Turkey and Estonia date back a
**century**]{.underline}, Liimets said, \"We will celebrate the 100th
anniversary of our diplomatic relations in 2024. All this time, we have
had very good relations between our countries that have developed and
strengthened with each passing year.\"

Expressing that the two countries focused on bilateral relations,
economy and security, Liimets added that Estonia is planning to
diversify its ties and look into different sectors. \"Tourism is one of
the important areas. I am very happy that we also have direct flights
between Istanbul and Tallinn, the capital of Estonia. So there is a lot
to talk about and much to progress.\"

Liimets stated that there will be more parliamentary interaction between
the two countries this year and that business delegations will visit
each other and said that trade, digital and defense cooperation between
Turkey and Estonia will progress.

On the two countries\' cooperation in the field of security and their
NATO partnership, she said: \"Estonia and Turkey are two very good
allies in NATO. [[We see Turkey as]{.mark} a **[very
capable]{.mark}**]{.underline}, good [ally who **understands** our
security concerns]{.underline} very well. Therefore, [we think there are
opportunities for **closer cooperation**]{.underline}. [We are grateful
for Turkey\'s commitment to NATO]{.underline}.\"

Reminding that a few years ago, [[Turkish pilots]{.mark} undertook the
task of **[protect]{.mark}**ing the **[Baltic]{.mark}**
[airspace]{.mark} within NATO]{.underline}, Liimets said that they are
grateful to Turkey for its contribution to this security issue, which is
important for Estonia and the Baltic countries.

Regarding the planned visit of the Estonian Chief of General Staff
Martin Herem to Turkey, Liimets said, \"It is very nice that our chiefs
of staff can come together and discuss these issues, since we cooperate
very closely [[in]{.underline}]{.mark} NATO.\"

Drawing attention to the issue of **[[cyber
security]{.underline}]{.mark}**, Minister Liimets stated that [[Turkey
is a member of the]{.mark} NATO [Joint Cyber]{.mark} ​​Defense
[Center]{.mark} of Excellence]{.underline} in Tallinn and that [[the two
countries are]{.mark} also **[cooperating closely]{.mark}** in this
field]{.underline}.

Migrant issue

[[Another point]{.underline}]{.mark} that Liimets touched upon
[[was]{.mark} the **[migration]{.mark} crisis**]{.underline}. Stating
that [Turkey\'s geographical location is at the **crossroads** of the
migration crisis]{.underline}, Liimets said: \"We really appreciate
Turkey\'s approach to the issue, which hosts millions of refugees on its
territory.\"

Underlining that Estonia has been providing financial aid to migrant
camps in Turkey and other countries, she said: \"We see that millions of
Syrians are forced to leave their country. We must all try to do our
best so that this country can find a political solution and all refugees
can safely return to their homeland.\"

At this week's NATO summit, President Biden met for the first time in a
year with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, setting aside his
long-standing issues with the Turkish leader. But [Turkey continues to
play **both sides** of the Russia-Ukraine conflict]{.underline}. [If the
United States is now willing to deal with Ankara, the **next deal**
should center on **persuading Erdogan**]{.underline} [to side with the
West on Ukraine]{.underline}.

There's no love lost between Biden and Erdogan. As a senator, Biden was
a regular critic of Turkey, owing in part to the strong Greek American
constituency in his home state of Delaware. As vice president, Biden
clashed with Erdogan over the Turkish leader's backsliding on democracy
and human rights. But [**despite** their mutual dislike, Erdogan has
long sought **Biden's validation**]{.underline}. This week's phone call
and bilateral meeting in Madrid with the U.S. president allowed Erdogan
to project himself to his people as an important leader on the world
stage.

The White House insists there was no quid pro quo. Yet officials
privately acknowledge that the close timing of the Biden
administration's newfound enthusiasm about selling F-16 fighter planes
to Turkey and Erdogan's decision to allow NATO to move forward with
membership for Sweden and Finland is no coincidence. This shows that
[the U.S. side is realistic about the **transactional nature** of the
relationship]{.underline}. Erdogan has always been --- and probably
always will be --- a problematic ally who demands concessions for doing
the right thing.

This week's [**positive** Biden-Erdogan interactions offer the chance
for a **significant upgrade** of relations after years of **mutual
neglect** and **distrust**]{.underline}. If both sides can muster the
political will to keep going, the next step would be to bring Turkey on
board with regard to the Ukraine crisis.

[There are **many ways** Turkey could be more supportive of
Ukraine]{.underline} --- if the United States and the West can convince
Erdogan that this is in his interest. [Turkey not only has refused to
join sanctions on Russia but also has become a key place for sanctions
evaders]{.underline}. [That **has to stop**]{.underline}. A Turkish firm
linked to Erdogan's family is giving Ukraine advanced drones, which is
good, but for months, [Ukraine has sought **more Turkish arms** to
include things such as **anti-missile systems**, **missiles** and
electronic warfare capabilities]{.underline}.

[Turkey could have the biggest impact by helping break the Russian
**naval blockade** of Odessa. By preventing grain exports, the Russians
are tanking the **Ukrainian economy**]{.underline} [and fueling a
**global food crisis**]{.underline}.

"The Biden administration's apparent support for new F-16s for Turkey
may be just the beginning of a strategy to bring Ankara along and
incentivize the Turkish government to move away from diplomacy with
Russia in favor of participating in an international effort to secure
Ukrainian agricultural exports," Steven Cook, a senior fellow at the
Council on Foreign Relations, told me.

Erdogan announced last week that his government will begin talks with
Moscow about opening "corridors" for grain exports, but that's likely
just a stall tactic by the Russians. When the futility of that effort
plays out, Turkey will have to decide whether to join Ukraine's partners
to facilitate the exports without Russia's permission.

"[Cracking open those ports may require a **more direct role** for the
United States and **NATO**]{.underline}," Cook said. "[Turkey would be
**important** in that effort as a **Black Sea power** and the country
that controls the **Bosporus Strait**]{.underline}."

To be sure, expectations that Erdogan will fully break with his friend,
Russian President Vladimir Putin, should be set low. The Turkish leader,
who faces political headwinds at home in advance of an election next
year, also has an incentive to continue mobilizing his nationalist
followers by demonizing the United States via his state-controlled
media.

But Biden's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, has long argued
for a more transactional approach in the U.S.-Turkey bilateral
relationship. Sullivan laid out this argument in a 2018 commentary he
co-wrote with Eric Edelman, a former U.S. ambassador to Turkey.

"[You'll **never** have a full rapprochement with Turkey]{.underline},"
Edelman told me. "[What you will have is a series of **one-off deals**.
And that's **not necessarily bad**]{.underline}."

[There are **good reasons** to think Erdogan's long flirtation with
Putin is **no longer** paying him dividends]{.underline}. Turkey must no
longer see Russia as a reliable arms supplier. [The war in Ukraine is
helping **push inflation** in Turkey to **unprecedented levels**,
**devastating** its already shaky economy]{.underline}. [Turkey has also
been confronting Russian forces in several places, including **Syria**,
**Libya** and **Nagorno-Karabakh**]{.underline}.

Sure, the United States could wait to see whether Erdogan falls from
power. But there is no guarantee that whatever government comes next
would be a better security partner in Ukraine. [Erdogan is the
problematic ally we know]{.underline} --- [and right now, he looks to be
in a mood to **make deals**]{.underline}.

[The Biden administration would be better off **holding its nose** and
**moving forward**]{.underline} [on improving relations with Turkey,
rather than spending its **limited diplomatic time** and **energy**
focusing on partners that have less ability or will to
help]{.underline}, such as Saudi Arabia. [Bringing Ankara on board could
be the key to helping Ukraine **break the stalemate** and **win the
war**]{.underline}.

American analysts have also raised the question of Turkey's expulsion
from NATO (Carpenter 2019). The suspension of membership rights or the
explosion of a member is not clearly stated in NATO's founding treaty.
Turkish policymakers do not consider unilaterally withdrawing from
NATO's collective security umbrella due to its troubled neighbourhood
and history with its current allies, Russia and Iran. However, the
escalating tension between the US and Turkey and restrictions on
security and defence alliance are likely to isolate Turkey from NATO
activities. [**Several NATO allies**, including Czechia, Finland,
France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, the UK, and
Canada, have already announced that they have **suspended** the sale of
military equipment to Turkey]{.underline} (BBC News 2019b). After the
UK, another NATO member Canada also decided to suspend exports related
to drone technology to Turkey on the basis that Turkey provided these
technologies to Azeri forces during the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict
(Reuters 2020). The US Ambassador to NATO, Kay Bailey Hutchison,
underlines that [Russia is trying to **flip** a key member of
NATO]{.underline}, and [Russia would be one of the **main
beneficiaries** of the destabilization of the alliance and Turkey's
expulsion]{.underline} (Hurriyet Daily News 2018). [Turkey was always
seen **valuable** ally and **indispensable**]{.underline} [member of
NATO because of its **geostrategic significance**]{.underline} [and
**military capabilities**]{.underline}. It has been argued that
[alienating Turkey from NATO is **not possible** for these
reasons]{.underline}, but there has been an ongoing Western effort to
develop alternative options for Turkey by promoting closer cooperation
with Greece, Bulgaria, and Romania (Idiz 2021). [With **increasing
isolation** from NATO, Turkey would **continue strengthening** its
military ties with Russia]{.underline}. Erdoğan has already confirmed
that Turkey will jointly produce S-500 defence systems with Russia
(Reuters 2019). [He underlined that]{.underline} '[if the US. refuses to
sell]{.underline} F-35 fighter jets, [then Turkey turns to **other
options'**]{.underline} (Hurriyet Daily News 2019b). Turkey's removal
from the F-35 program might likely force Turkey to look for other
options, possibly Russian Su-34 and Su-57 fighter jets (Groll and
Seligman 2019). In this case, [Turkey's over-reliance on Russia will
reduce its capacity to **formulate** independent foreign
policies]{.underline} and pursue its national interest. Russia is
increasingly becoming Turkey's neighbour, which might be a problem for
Turkey in the mid-to-long term.5 Turkish policymakers are aware of this
dilemma, and instead of opting for Russian jets (compensate F-35), in
October 2021, Turkey has requested to buy 40 new F-16 fighter jets and
80 modernization kits for its existing air forces from the US (Pamuk and
Stone 2021). [The American attitude will be **decisive**]{.underline}
[in Turkey's return to the **Western fold** or **further isolation**
from the alliance]{.underline}.

Following the American withdrawal and Turkish military incursions in
Syria, French President Emmanuel [Macron criticized the lack of
coordination between NATO allies]{.underline}. [He expressed his
frustration by stating that NATO is experiencing]{.underline} '**[brain
death']{.underline}** (Solletty 2019). [Biden calls for a **renewed
commitment** to **multilateralism**]{.underline} [and strengthening the
transatlantic ties]{.underline} that were weakened during Trump's
America first policy. Pentagon defines the current security environment
by identifying China as a 'pacing challenge' within the strategic
competition, whereas Russia has been identified as a significant but
'lesser threat' to US interests and security (Vergun 2021). The Biden
administration re-embraces the 'pivot to Asia' rhetoric introduced by
the Obama administration in 2011, referring to the development of a
grand strategy to deal with the North Korean threat and China (Manyin et
al. 2012). However, Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine demonstrates
that currently, Russia poses a greater risk to the rule-based
international system, and the American pivot will be towards Russia and
Europe. [Strengthening transatlantic ties is **not possible** without
taking Turkey back from Russia]{.underline}. [Turkey, NATO's
**second-largest army** and **third most populous** member, has a
geostrategic significance due to its **proximity**]{.underline} [to
**Russia** and the **Middle East**]{.underline}. [It would help **limit
Russian expansion** in **several regions**, including the **MENA**,
**Eastern Mediterranean**]{.underline} [and the **Black
Sea**]{.underline}. Therefore, [bringing back Turkey to the Western camp
is important to **contain** the US adversaries in multiple regions since
Turkey **actively fought** on the **opposing side** of
Russia]{.underline} in those regions. Turkey actively has pursued
increasingly military engagement abroad; it has launched four major
military operations in Syria, deployed military troops in Qatar and
Somalia, introduced the Blue Homeland doctrine, and expanded its defence
exports. Turkey's indigenous unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV)
capabilities are an element of Turkey's changing defence and security
policies, as its drone capabilities are progressing rapidly. Israel was
the main contractor supplying unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) to the
Turkish military (Defense Industry Daily 2011). However, with the
flotilla crisis in 2010, Turkish-Israeli diplomatic relations collapsed,
and Turkey has started to focus on developing its domestic drone program
UCAV fleet known as the Bayraktar TB2. The Bayraktar TB2 has been
operative since 2015 and became a valuable strategic asset in Turkey's
counterterrorism operations against the PKK in Northern Iraq, Syria and
Libya. In recent years, Turkey's drone power gained attention
internationally. The Bayraktar TB2 armed UAVs significantly contributed
to Azerbaijan's victory (Kınık and Çelik 2021), and [**Ukraine** has
been relying on Turkish-made drones]{.underline} to target Russian
targets (Forrest and Malsin 2022), [which implies the possibility that
Turkey's **indigenous**, but **ambitious** defence industry can be used
to **balance against** Russia]{.underline}.

Turkey did not participate in the EU sanctions against Russia after
Russia's military incursion in 2014 due to economic reasons (Sputnik
News 2015), and Turkish authorities declared that Turkey had no
intention or plan to join/impose sanctions against Russia following the
invasion of Ukraine. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevüt Çavuşoğlu emphasizes
the importance of keeping communication channels open and underlines
that 'we are the country that can establish a dialogue on both sides in
order to end the war' (Hurrriyet Daily News 2022). Turkish authorities
are willing to continue cooperation with Russia due to trade and energy
dependency and the national security interests in Syria. A successful
balancing strategy between Russia and the West in Ukraine might give
Erdoğan a win in the international arena that he desperately needs for
the upcoming 2023 general election. Turkey has adopted a 'strategic
balancer' position, and it is trying to balance its NATO alliance by
cooperating with emerging non-Western partners in Eurasia, including
Russia, Iran, and China (Flanagan et al. 2020, 47). While Turkey's
manoeuvre is perceived as a threat to the Western alliance, [Turkey's
**competition** with Russia in **various regions** could also be an
**asset**]{.underline} [for NATO to balance against Russia in the **long
run**]{.underline}.

Recently, Turkey has been signalling to block NATO's expansion and
inclusion of the two Nordic countries, Finland and Sweden, in the
security alliance. Turkey's concerns regarding accepting new members are
based on these two countries', especially Sweden's, support for terror
organizations, referring to the PKK. Turkey insists that both countries
should amend their terror laws. Turkey's threat to veto NATO's
enlargement is consistent with policy-making elites' security-first
rhetoric. Russian aggression and NATO's enlargement agenda become an
opportunity for Turkey to pressure the two to revise their law, stop
harbouring terrorist groups, and pressure NATO allies to lift sanctions
on Turkey's defence industry. Turkey's objection to the transatlantic
alliance enlargement will likely dominate the upcoming NATO Summit in
Madrid. As the NATO members prioritize strengthening the alliance in the
wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Turkey's security-driven
discourse and possible veto for new members might lead to re-questioning
Turkey's faithful ally role.

Conclusion

Syrian civil war and regional instabilities as independent variables
have been incorporated with unit-level intervening variables (Turkish
decision-making elites' threat perceptions, nationalism, societal
cohesion, and AKP's vulnerability to domestic instabilities) and
eventually have shaped the Turkish foreign policy formulation and
outcomes. The analysis of intervening variables helps to understand how
Turkish policymakers extracted and mobilized state resources to respond
to systemic pressure and identified threats in Turkey's immediate
neighbourhood. Both the internal and external factors have been
influential in the country's security-first policy and military
activism, deteriorating relations with the US, and
competitive-cooperation with Russia. Turkish policymakers have
prioritized Turkey's national security over its faithful ally status.
The first delivery of S-400s and the US decision to remove Turkey from
the F-35 program were among the most significant ruptures in
Turkish-American relations. Any expectation of achieving a mutually
acceptable solution on S-400s and the YPG seems impossible anytime soon.
Turkey still insists on keeping S-400s despite its expulsion from the
F-35 program. The US decision to continue its support to the YPG will
push Turkey to make new deals with Russia to get a second battery of
S-400s. [The development in Ukraine is a **game-changer**]{.underline}
[for Turkish-American and Turkish-Russian relations]{.underline}.

[The **visible shift** in Turkish foreign policy behaviour in the recent
decade **cannot be interpreted** as a shift in Turkey's **overall**
foreign policy orientation]{.underline}. The AKP-MHP policy-making
elites aim to reposition Turkey in the changing geopolitical realities
by adopting a balancing strategy to manage the country's relations with
the US and Russia while maintaining power at home. [Turkey's **NATO
membership** is still the **main axis** of Turkish foreign policy.
Russian challenge to the rule-based liberal international order is
likely to **end discussions**]{.underline} [regarding Turkey's **NATO
membership** at a time when the Western alliance **cannot afford any
friction**]{.underline} among NATO members. [The **solidarity** among
NATO allies will be the **most critical** concern among the Western
countries]{.underline} in the following years. Thus, despite Erdoğan's
increasing authoritarianism and acquisition of S-400s Biden
administration is likely to avoid escalating tension with Turkey.
[Turkey's **geostrategic significance** for NATO missions makes it an
**indispensable** ally]{.underline}. [Turkey hosts the Incirlik
**airbase** and Kürecik radar base and controls the **straits** of the

continue to deepen its military ties with Russia by being part of the

As the war between Russia and Ukraine grinds on [and as the need to
maintain a **united front** against Moscow **grows**, Turkey and the
United States are seeking to put their long-troubled relationship on a
**better path**]{.underline}. [The new U.S.-Turkey Strategic
Mechanism]{.underline}, announced in early April 2022, [is a
**promising**]{.underline} [(but **tentative**]{.underline}) [step
forward]{.underline}.

The mechanism grew out of an understanding reached between Turkish
President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and U.S. President Joe Biden during their
meeting on the margins of the October 2021 G20 summit in Rome. Though
the idea is said to belong to Biden, the U.S. readout after the meeting
lacked any reference to the mechanism, whereas it was the highlight of
the Turkish narrative. This difference in emphasis initially triggered
rumors that the United States might be dragging its feet.

After the initiative was announced, U.S. Under Secretary of Commerce for
International Trade Marisa Lago visited Turkey to explore opportunities
in commercial relations and to discuss how Turkey's Russia-dependent
energy mix could be diversified. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlüt
Çavuşoğlu will travel to the United States to meet with U.S. Secretary
of State Antony Blinken on May 18 in the first cabinet-level bilateral
visit between the two countries since the Biden administration took
office. The initial plans had been to have this meeting in Washington,
DC, but the venue has been moved to New York, and [the program has been
**curtailed**]{.underline}, reportedly [at the **behest** of the United
States]{.underline} and probably in reaction to the conviction of
Turkish philanthropist Osman Kavala. [While the process **hasn't been
derailed**, this experience serves as a reminder that the mechanism is
**vulnerable**]{.underline} [to different dynamics. Its
**sustainability** and **potential**]{.underline} [to have a **positive
impact** depend on]{.underline} Ankara and [Washington making the
**right choices**]{.underline} [to **facilitate** and **not undermine**
policy convergences]{.underline}.

Turkish and American sources talk of the Strategic Mechanism as a
structured platform in which all matters can be discussed, with an
emphasis on advancing practical bilateral cooperation. The level of
ambition that Ankara and Washington will set for the mechanism is yet to
be seen and will be important, particularly in view of the failure of
some past attempts. [The two governments established working groups in
2018 to resolve disputes]{.underline} on consular affairs, Syria policy,
and Turkey's purchase of the Russian S-400 air defense system, [but
these efforts **failed** to deliver results and were **quickly
forgotten**]{.underline}. The United States had been reluctant to go
forward with the idea at the time, and the lesson from that experience
is that, unless the parties have a shared sense of understanding of and
joint commitment to the process, its chances of success are slim.

[If the Strategic Mechanism is to **avoid the fate**]{.underline} [of
the 2018 working groups, Washington]{.underline} and Ankara [will need
to **invest seriously**]{.underline} [in the process and display real
**political ownership**]{.underline}; [agree on clear, **shared**, and
diverse **objectives**]{.underline}; [and simultaneously work
to]{.underline} resolve or at least **[minimize]{.underline}** [their
bilateral disputes]{.underline}.

DEMONSTRATING POLITICAL OWNERSHIP

[The mechanism will be **dead on arrival** unless there is **shared
commitment** in]{.underline} Ankara and [Washington]{.underline}.
[**Geopolitical considerations** are currently driving this
commitment]{.underline} in both countries. [Russia's brazen war in
Ukraine]{.underline} and the global divide of systemic rivalry have
[affected how Turkey and the United States view each other]{.underline}.
[These events have changed their calculus **in favor** of **closer
relations**]{.underline} and, in turn, have nurtured the idea of such a
mechanism.

[For Turkey, balancing Russia has consistently been a
consideration]{.underline}. [From Ankara's perspective, the reality is
that its **security**, **deterrence**, and **economic
livelihood**]{.underline} [are bolstered by its membership in **NATO**,
its **alliance** with the United States, and its]{.underline} albeit
shaky [inclusion]{.underline} nowadays [in the family of liberal
democracies]{.underline}. Meanwhile, [the Turkish economy is in **dire
straits**]{.underline} as the country's 2023 parliamentary and
presidential elections loom on the horizon, [forcing the government into
looking for **international success stories**]{.underline}. The United
States, on the other hand, is grappling with the fact that [Turkey is a
significant **geopolitical middle power**]{.underline} in its immediate
region and beyond. [Having Turkey as an ally has started to **matter
more** again]{.underline}. In short, realpolitik calculations are at
play for both sides.

[For the purposes of **optics** and **practicality**, the Strategic
Mechanism would benefit from being designed and seen as something
**more** than a bureaucratic exercise. For this to happen, it needs a
**meaningful political embrace** from both sides]{.underline}.
Underscoring the mechanism's importance with a meeting between the two
countries' presidents would give it a big boost. It is no secret that
the Biden administration has been cold-shouldering Turkey. This has been
evident in the choice Biden and his senior team have made to limit their
interactions with their Turkish counterparts, something that Erdoğan has
publicly lamented.

U.S. officials have already spoken of the possibility of such a meeting
on the mechanism, and Turkey would certainly welcome the idea. The two
presidents have only met twice so far since Biden took office, with both
encounters on the margins of international meetings. The same
arrangement could be made, for example, during the upcoming UN General
Assembly meeting in New York in September 2022. [The **direct
involvement** of Erdoğan and Biden would give the mechanism **good
optics**, **add impetus** to the initiative, and]{.underline} (maybe
even more importantly) perhaps [restrain potential **spoilers** on
either side]{.underline}.

SETTING SHARED OBJECTIVES

U.S.-Turkey relations have deteriorated seriously since the early 2000s,
starting with differences over the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq. The tenor
of bilateral ties has mostly been on a downward trajectory since. An
accumulated host of disagreements have kept a damper on the
relationship, including on topics like Syria policy, Washington's
half-hearted reaction to the 2016 coup attempt in Turkey, the unfettered
ability of the Gulen movement (which Ankara holds accountable for this
failed attempt) to still function in the United States, Ankara's
decision to purchase Russia's S-400 air defense system and ensuing U.S.
sanctions, and the overall unhappiness in Washington with the
incremental dismantling of democratic governance in Turkey.

A byproduct of the regression in U.S.-Turkey relations has been a
decrease in bilateral exchanges, which is slowly eroding valuable human
networks and taking a toll on the culture of cooperation between the two
countries. The Strategic Mechanism can reverse this trend by breaking
the numbing effect that disagreements have had on U.S.-Turkey ties. But
for this to happen, Washington and Ankara will need to set clear,
mutually agreed-on objectives and diversify their objectives to avoid
simply trying to address the well-worn agenda of existing disputes.

The 2018 working groups exemplified the damaging effects of failing to
achieve these goals. This time, the idea behind the Strategic Mechanism
is different. Stimulating an agenda of practical cooperation, without
ruling out the possibility of discussing disagreements, is a good way to
strike a balance.

Ukraine will be a natural topic of discussion within the mechanism. This
should be more than an act of ritualistic exchange and should instead
focus on concrete deliverables, including for the post-conflict stage.
[The future Euroatlantic **security architecture**]{.underline} and
Russia's role therein [and bilateral U.S.-Turkey collaboration in
**rebuilding** and **rehabilitating**]{.underline} [war-torn Ukraine
are]{.underline} two [themes that come to mind]{.underline}. Meanwhile,
[the **departure** of U.S. firms from Russia and the need for at least
some of them to **relocate** their investments and production lines, as
well as the realization about the importance of **reliable supply
chains**, create new dynamics where Turkey can bring **added
value**]{.underline}. Given that the United States has become Turkey's
second-largest gas supplier after Russia and that bilateral U.S.-Turkey
trade posted a 30 percent increase last year to reach record highs,
energy and trade are two other promising areas of cooperation that the
Strategic Mechanism can help consolidate.

[The list can be extended]{.underline}. [Turkey's ambitious outreach to
**Africa**]{.underline} [and its growing footprint on the continent, as
well as its renewed efforts to **mend fences** with **Armenia**, present
further opportunities of **convergence**]{.underline} with the United
States. And despite some serious differences over Syria policy, Turkish
and U.S. officials need to continue exploring options for facilitating a
political settlement that would allow for the voluntary return of Syrian
refugees to their home country.

[If]{.underline} Ankara and [Washington can advance cooperation in
**some** of these areas, that would **qualitatively
improve**]{.underline} [a U.S.-Turkey partnership that has traditionally
been set in a **straitjacket**]{.underline} [of]{.underline} sometimes
[divergent security and defense interests]{.underline}. [The Strategic
Mechanism can help **broaden** this relationship and make it more
**resilient**]{.underline}. [The proposal's added value would lie in
introducing **structure** and **continuity**]{.underline} [to
**different strands** of engagement]{.underline} between the two
countries [and in its potential to **swiftly elevate** ripe schemes to
political decisionmakers for their endorsement]{.underline}. In short,
if the objectives are set right, the Strategic Mechanism could hasten
both the incubation and implementation of useful ideas.

REDUCING THE POISONING EFFECTS OF DISAGREEMENTS

If the Strategic Mechanism is to help Turkey and the United States
engage more deeply and enhance practical cooperation, something will
have to be done in tandem to mitigate the poisoning effects of bilateral
disagreements. This is where things get more complicated, and there is a
mismatch between Ankara and Washington in terms of not only policy
substance but also methods of diplomatic negotiations.

First, while Russia's war on Ukraine and its generally aggressive
posturing, as well as related geopolitical dynamics, have created a
convergence between Ankara and Washington, there is also the risk that
both sides may believe their own hand has been strengthened at the
expense of the other. In fairness, they both have valid reasons to think
so. Turkey is inclined to focus on and overstate the value of its
geopolitical stock, which has clearly appreciated in the wake of the
crisis, while the United States would prefer to stress the need for an
awakening in Ankara on the risks associated with entanglement with and
exposure to Russia. Blinken alluded to U.S. expectations in general
terms while testifying before Congress in late April, when he spoke of
the strategic opportunities that U.S. officials see in the ways various
countries are rethinking the now more evident risks associated with
dependencies on Russia. Both Turkey and the United States should be
careful not to overplay their hands at this time of opportunity. If
Turkey and Washington are to resolve, or at least mitigate, the negative
effects of their differences, their point of departure cannot be that
each side feels it has the upper hand and can now impose its will on the
other. They will both need to compromise.

Second, while it is wise to spare the Strategic Mechanism of the burden
of pointedly focusing on bilateral disagreements, assuming these matters
can simply be set aside would be a mistake. The poisonous seeping
effects of the problems weighing down the relationship do not afford the
luxury of time. That is the underlying risk associated with seemingly
practical solutions like embracing transactionalism, attempting
compartmentalization, and focusing on low-hanging fruit while leaving
problems on the back burner. Such an attempt would mean sleepwalking
toward a future in which current problems will probably become more
ossified and solutions will be harder to find. Despite such risks,
Washington seems more inclined to wait things out, mostly because of its
reluctance to engage in a process that is limited to rehashing arguments
that have already been made to no effect. Turkey, on the other hand,
seems ready to continue the debate, no matter what. The gap that needs
to be bridged here involves identifying new common ground to move on.
That is the incentive both sides need, and in Washington's case, it is
seen as a prerequisite. But the onus to create these conditions cannot
fall on one side alone. It must be a mutual endeavor.

Two priorities are the S-400 conundrum and differences in Syria. On the
first point, while Turkey tested the Russian-acquired system in late
2020 as part of the acquisition process, Ankara has chosen not to bring
the system online yet. The Turkish government should hold this posture.
It should concurrently stop amplifying the message that it retains the
right to acquire additional systems from Russia and refrain from
posturing through such statements. Political and operational realities
emerging from the war in Ukraine should already have put an end to the
debate over the expediency of adding Russian weapons systems to Turkey's
defense inventory. Many useful ideas on how to overcome the S-400
problem have already been put forward, and any solution will need to
involve a workable formula to meet or work around the requirement in the
U.S. National Defense Authorization Act calling for Turkey's
nonpossession of the system as a condition for sanctions to be lifted.
[Progress on]{.underline} this and also on [Turkey's request to
purchase]{.underline} forty state-of-the-art F-16 fighter jets and
eighty modernization kits for its existing aircraft [would mark a
**significant breakthrough**]{.underline} [in bilateral relations and
would have **positive ripple effects**]{.underline}. There are
encouraging signs that the F-16 issue may slowly be evolving in the
right direction.

It will be equally important to find a way forward in Syria. The
perception that the United States continues to supply Kurdish elements
that Ankara believes are associated with the Kurdistan Workers' Party
(PKK), a separatist militant group that targets Turkey and that is
listed as a terrorist organization in the United States and the EU, is
taking a heavy toll on Turkish sentiments toward the United States. The
harm this is doing to bilateral relations cannot be overstated. While
the United States may have internally normalized this state of affairs,
the same cannot be expected of Turkey. Nor would that expectation
correspond to the repeated assurances the United States has given Turkey
in the past. When U.S. officials chose to begin this engagement in
Syria, they reassured Turkey repeatedly that the arrangement was
temporary, transactional, and tactical--- geared solely to fighting the
threat of the self-proclaimed Islamic State. This would be the right
moment for the United States to start considering how to wind down its
engagement with these Kurdish elements in Syria and for Turkey to come
forward with practical solutions that address overriding U.S. security
interests in Syria on the threat posed by the Islamic State, though
there is little visible appetite in Washington to do so now.

Another relevant factor is the state of democracy and the rule of law in
Turkey. This will have a bearing on the type of engagement Turkey and
the United States can achieve through the Strategic Mechanism and
beyond. The view that Turkey is backsliding on its human rights and rule
of law standards is a fundamental problem. It is severely undermining
Ankara's image and interests, including on the economic front in terms
of the country's perceived investment climate. Turkey's quest to
establish a solid international reputation cannot be achieved when the
Turkish government, for instance, disregards its obligations under
international law and under its own constitution to uphold decisions by
the European Court of Human Rights. As Turkey speaks of a new era in its
foreign policy and tries to portray itself in a positive light as a
responsible and reliable international actor, it cannot concurrently
tighten the screws internally on the Turkish people's freedoms and human
rights or flout its relevant responsibilities. This is particularly true
as the temptation grows to define the global order by delineating
between democratic states and nondemocratic ones. Turkey's aspirations
and actions should correspond to those befitting truly democratic
states. This would strengthen Turkey's hand in every respect and augment
its ability to make the most of the Strategic Mechanism with the United
States.

THE GLASS IS HALF FULL

[The U.S.-Turkey Strategic Mechanism is **no silver
bullet**]{.underline}, and one should not expect any miracles.
[Rebuilding trust between Ankara and Washington and changing accumulated
negative perceptions will take **patience** and **concrete
action**]{.underline}. By consolidating different strands of bilateral
engagement under shared political ownership, [the Strategic Mechanism
can be a useful **force multiplier**]{.underline}. [**Despite skeptics**
on both sides and against all odds, the glass is **half full** in
U.S.-Turkey relations]{.underline}: [if used **wisely** and **in
conjunction** with the **right policy** choices, the Strategic Mechanism
can help **bolster this momentum**]{.underline}.

meaning, expressed in another way, would be [\'within the limits or

that an employer is subject to the Act if, during the course of, or
within the limits or duration of each of three calendar quarters, he had
in covered employment four or more workers, to each of whom the required

not be simultaneous. [**[Obviously, the word \'in\' does not mean

employed for a full calendar quarter would be paid less than \$50 in

[The **ordinary-meaning rule** is the [**most fundamental semantic

### The

#### **The most precise definition of "The" specifies particulars**

**Supreme Court of Minnesota 12**. "State v. Hohenwald"; A10-1986; July
11, 2012; Lexis //BY

With regard to Minn. R. Crim. P. 20.01, [the definite article
\"the\"]{.underline} is a word of limitation that indicates a reference
to a specific object. The definite article \"the\" [particularizes the
subject which it precedes. \"The\" is used before]{.underline} singular
or plural [nouns and noun phrases]{.underline} that denote
**[particular, specified]{.underline}** persons or [things]{.underline}
Applying the word \"the\" as a word of limitation, Rule 20.01 requires
the suspension of the proceedings in the then-existing case in which the
court orders the suspension, not in an unspecified or indefinite number
of cases. The word \"the\" is a word of limitation, [not a word of
indefinite or **generalizing** **force.**]{.underline} [If the drafters
of the criminal rules intended to suspend **all
proceedings**]{.underline} brought against a particular criminal
defendant, including those not yet in existence, [they could have easily
used]{.underline} [words]{.underline} to that effect [by
suspending]{.underline} \"**[all criminal proceedings]{.underline}**\"
[or]{.underline} \"**[any criminal proceedings]{.underline}**.\"
[Thus]{.underline}, **[the most natural reading]{.underline}** of Rule
20.01 is that it [requires]{.underline} district [courts to
suspend]{.underline} the [proceedings in only the **particular**
case]{.underline} in which it orders the suspension, [not in
**all**]{.underline} prospective [actions]{.underline} that could
possibly arise during the period of suspension.

#### "The" can determine specifics

**Supreme Court of Michigan 21**. "Ricks v. State"; July 8, 2021; Lexis
//BY

In its review of the threshold-eligibility requirements in MCL
691.1755(1), [the Court of Appeals aptly recognized that the Legislature
repeatedly used the word]{.underline} \[\*\*440\]
**[\"the\"]{.underline}** [in front of \"crimes,\"]{.underline}
[\"charges,\" and \"judgment of conviction]{.underline}\" in MCL
691.1755(1)(a) to (c) in setting forth when a plaintiff is eligible for
compensation under the WICA. On the other hand, the Legislature uses the
word \"another\" before \"criminal offense\" in MCL 691.1755(1)(b) and
\[\*\*\*27\] \"conviction\" in MCL 691.1755(4)---other subsections of
MCL 691.1755 that explain when a plaintiff is not eligible for
compensation. [We have]{.underline} previously **[defined
\"the\"]{.underline}** [as a \"definite article]{.underline} . . .
([used, especially before a noun,]{.underline} **[with a specifying or
particularizing effect]{.underline}**, [as opposed to]{.underline} the
**[indefinite or generalizing force]{.underline}** of the indefinite
article a or an).\"20Link to the text of the note As an adjective,
\"another\" is defined as \"different or distinct from the one first
considered\"; \"some other\"; or \"being one more in addition to one or
more of the same kind.\"21Link to the text of the note [Accordingly, the
Legislature\'s **use of** **\"the\"**]{.underline} [before \"crimes,\"
\"charges,\" and \"judgment of conviction\" throughout MCL
691.1755(1)(a) to (c)]{.underline} [means]{.underline} [those
provisions]{.underline} **[refer to the specific crimes and
charges]{.underline}** leading to a plaintiff\'s wrongful conviction and
imprisonment that gave rise to a WICA claim. The Legislature\'s use of
\"another\" before \"criminal offense\" in MCL 691.1755(1)(b) and
\"conviction\" in MCL 691.1755(4) \[\*413\] means those provisions refer
to some other offense or conviction that is different or distinct from
the wrongful conviction and imprisonment, and which therefore does not
warrant compensation under the WICA. Thus, MCL 691.1755 reflects the
overall structure of the WICA in only providing compensation for the
specific crimes, charges, or convictions \[\*\*\*28\] that the plaintiff
was wrongfully convicted of and imprisoned for, and which ultimately
form the basis of the WICA claim---not \"another\" crime, charge, or
conviction.

The lack of clarity for EDI authorities notwithstanding, [efforts to
build defense capacity in the Baltic States were **bolstered** by the
overhaul of the security cooperation regime]{.underline} in the FY17
NDAA. [In an attempt [to **simplify the quagmire**]{.mark} that
[security cooperation]{.mark} authorities [had become]{.mark} over the
past fifteen years,]{.underline} [[Congress]{.mark} streamlined the
dozens of various temporary and permanent sources of authority and
codified]{.underline} [them under one chapter in Title 10 of the U.S.
Code]{.underline}. 125 [Congress noted the increasingly more important
role **security cooperation** plays in **DoD operations**]{.underline},
126 and the below discussion of how [EUCOM can leverage these new
authorities to **augment EDI demonstrates**]{.underline} [the potential
utility such activities can have within NATO\'s deterrence
strategy.]{.underline}

3\. Defense Security Cooperation and the Baltic States

[Since]{.underline} the terrorist attacks of 11 September
[2001]{.underline}, [Congress [granted]{.mark} more [authority to the
DoD to]{.mark} [engage in security cooperation]{.mark} with foreign
militaries]{.underline}, [a mission originally conducted by the DoS.
Over that time, security cooperation became an integral part of the
DoD\'s mission and is considered an important tool for executing its
national security responsibilities]{.underline}. 127 The FY17 NDAA
overhauled the previously unwieldy patchwork of authorities that made up
the security cooperation regime and provides authority for the DoD to
enhance interoperability and increase defense capability of friendly
foreign militaries. [As building partner capacity with newer NATO
members is one of the five lines of effort under EDI]{.underline}, 128
[these new authorities should be leveraged to the maximum extent
possible]{.underline} by EUCOM in the Baltic States [to ensure
sufficient capability exists in that vulnerable region to **deter Russia
aggression**]{.underline}. However, as discussed below, the source of
funding for these authorities and whether they can be used in
conjunction with EDI funds remains ambiguous.

a\. Building Defense Capacity

Key among the changes is the replacement of 10 U.S.C. § 2282 on
\"Authority to Build the Capacity of Foreign Security Forces\" with a
new permanent authority that widens the scope of security cooperation
the DoD can provide. 129 While the scope of Section 2282 was limited
primarily to counterterrorism and stability operations, 130 broadens the
scope of authorized foreign capacity building to include, among other
purposes, training, and equipping for border security and operations or
activities that contribute to an international coalition operation that
is in the national interest of the United States. 131 Moreover, 10
U.S.C. § 333, Section 2282\'s replacement, will permit the DoD to
provide lethal equipment on a global scale, which it was unable to do
under Section 2282. 132 Finally, Section 333 allows the DoD to support
the sustainment of previously provided equipment to foreign partners,
whereas such sustainment was previously under the exclusive purview of
the DoS through its Foreign Military Financing account. 133 This
bureaucratic anachronism resulted in equipment at risk of disrepair,
misuse, and inoperability by the foreign recipient. 134

Under the definitions section of the Security Cooperation chapter,
[security cooperation programs]{.underline}, such as those authorized by
Section 333, [include [building]{.mark} and developing [allied security
capabilities]{.mark} for **self-defense [and]{.mark} building
[relationships]{.mark}** that promote specific U.S. security
interests]{.underline}. 135 The DoD should utilize these new authorities
to build capacity in the security forces of the Baltic States in a way
that it was unable to do so under the previous law. However, because
Section 333 did not become law until the final days of Fiscal Year 2017
when it replaces Section 2282, 136 the utility of this new authority was
largely unknown in FY17 and remains little used due to the complexity of
funding Section 333 activities. Section 333 provides the sole source of
funding shall come out of amounts authorized and appropriated for such
fiscal year for O&M, Defense-wide, and available for the Defense
Security Cooperation Agency. 137 However, Section 1241 of the FY17 NDAA
adds additional sources of funding for Fiscal Year 2017 relevant to the
Baltic States, including O&M Defense-wide, available for the Defense
Security Cooperation Agency as specified in the funding table in Section
4301 of the FY17 NDAA, 138 as well as for the same line of items in the
OCO O&M funding table in Section 4302. 139 The dual funding sources, O&M
and OCO O&M, highlight the potential overlap between Section 333
capacity building, which are funded by O&M, and EDI capacity building,
which is funded by OCO O&M. To avoid obligating funds from the wrong
account, commanders must know whether the activity falls under EDI, and
whether security cooperation funds can be used in addition to EDI or
exclusively. Clarifying legislation can help resolve this confusion. 140

b\. Operational Support to Foreign Forces

In addition to the replacement of Section 2282, the FY17 NDAA greatly
expands the authority to provide support for conduct of operations to
friendly foreign countries, replacing Section 1207 from the Fiscal Year
2016 NDAA, which was limited to providing support to African countries
conducting counterterrorism activities. 141 Section 1245 of the FY17
NDAA, codified at 10 U.S.C. § 331, greatly expands the scope of the
previous authority by eliminating geographic limitations. 142 This new
authority provides funding of logistic support, supplies, and services
to security forces in a friendly country, as well as small-scale
construction projects to facilitate friendly country participation in
U.S.-supported operations. 143

One provision that, if utilized by EUCOM, could meaningfully assist
improving the defense capability in the Baltic States is the special
procurement authority that allows the DoD to procure equipment \"for the
purpose of the loan of such equipment to the military forces of a
friendly foreign country participating in a U.S.-supported coalition or
combined operation.\" 144 This is \"to enhance capabilities or to
increase interoperability with \[U.S. forces\] and other coalition
partners.\" 145 Because the intent of the authority is that the friendly
country will reimburse the United States for the procurement, or the
U.S. forces can to reuse the equipment, there is no limitation on the
value of the procurement. 146

[The DoD should utilize this authorization to procure an excess quantity
of U.S.-used systems to ensure friendly forces use and train on the same
equipment as U.S. forces.]{.underline} Use of equipment, coupled with
training and exercises will increase familiarity and interoperability
with U.S. forces and provide friendly foreign forces with confidence in
operating weapon systems alongside the United States. A successful loan
may influence the friendly force\'s procurement decisions, leading to
more effective use of defense spending by the friendly force at no real
cost to the United States, as the equipment is returned at the end of
the loan period. However, [it remains unclear as to what limitations on
the type of procurement there are, if any]{.underline}. **[For example,
the law is silent as to whether this section authorizes procurement for
loaning weapon systems. 147 Nor does it provide the maximum duration of
any loan.]{.underline}** Nonetheless, the DoD should leverage the
seemingly broad authority granted by Congress to procure equipment for
the purpose of loaning such equipment to its allies to improve
interoperability and bolster the defense capability of its allies in
Eastern Europe.

c\. Training and Exercises

Finally, perhaps [the best way the DoD can maximize the operational
readiness of its NATO partners is through **[extensive training and
exercises]{.mark}**]{.underline}. 148 Training of NATO members near
Russia is essential to ensure those members, such as the Baltic States
and Poland, can cope with hybrid warfare that may not trigger Article 5.
149 Moreover, frequent military exercises with U.S. forces can enhance
those armed forces\' capabilities. Wide-scale multinational exercises on
NATO\'s eastern flank would also serve a dual purpose of reassuring
allies and warning foes. 150 Recognizing the importance of multinational
training and exercises, Congress sought to provide broader authority for
commanders of combatant commands and service secretaries to authorize
payment of certain expenses for friendly foreign countries resulting
from participating in training and exercises with U.S. general forces.
151 This expands the previous authority, which was limited to payment of
only incremental expenses to developing countries when authorized by the
Secretary of Defense. This was only after a determination that \"the
participation by such country is necessary to the achievement of the
fundamental objectives of the exercise and that those objectives cannot
be achieved unless the United States provides the incremental expenses
incurred by such country.\" 152 **[The new authority requires only the
determination by the Secretary of Defense that support of the friendly
foreign force is in the national security interest of the United States
to do so, and expands the scope and type of payment for training and
exercise expenses. 153 It allows a commander of a combatant command to
authorize payment for expenses associated with training, exercises,
deployment to such events, incremental expenses, and small-scale
construction directly related to the effective accomplishment of such
events, with the prior approval of the Secretary of Defense.
154]{.underline}**

Beyond the benefit of paying for expenses to attract participation by
other countries, [this authority also appears to permit foreign forces
to develop new capacity by allowing for training to improve the capacity
of foreign forces beyond minimal level necessary [to achieve
**interoperability**]{.mark}]{.underline}, safety, or familiarization
with U.S. forces in preparing for combined military operations.\" 155
While the new law states that the primary purpose of the training and
exercises is to train U.S. forces, 156 there is no limiting language,
such as restricting the training of foreign forces to only safety and
interoperability. Thus, [so long as U.S. forces are receiving the
benefit of the training and exercises, the participation by other
friendly forces and use of this authority for funding is
permitted.]{.underline} Granting the DoD this authority allows it to
better program more robust exercises and training focused on capacity
building of the Baltic States\' forces.

[Consistent with the intent of EDI and RAP, **EUCOM should use this
authority to the fullest extent practicable to integrate multinational
forces**]{.underline}, [particularly in command]{.underline} and
control, intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, **[and cyber
defense]{.underline}**, [where **interoperability**]{.underline} is
[critical to defending against **Russian aggression.**]{.underline} 157
Moreover, this authority\'s provision for small-scale construction
permits to building necessary infrastructure within Eastern Europe that
would otherwise be challenging for approval. Provided the project does
not represent a foreign assistance program, structures built in support
of U.S. military personnel participating in overseas training and
exercises need not be temporary structures. 158 The explicit limitation
on such military construction is that no one project may exceed \$
750,000 in costs, 159 and the implicit limitation comes from the absence
of any authority for the maintenance of such construction projects after
the completion of the exercise. Nonetheless, this authority appears to
permit the United States to fund and build in a friendly foreign
country, and the beneficiary can then decide to keep and maintain the
project for its own future use. The resulting infrastructure will
provide training and exercise opportunities where there may have been
none absent this authority.

establishes the NATO Alliance, states its mission, and grants privileges
and immunities to its subordinate elements]{.underline}. The next
section provides an overview of some of these key agreements.

A. North Atlantic Treaty of 1949

[The North Atlantic Treaty]{.underline}, also known as the Washington
Treaty, [establishes **NATO legal authority**]{.underline},
[**organization**, and **function**]{.underline}. 11 NATO is both a
political entity and a military entity. NATO\'s political leader is the
Secretary General (currently Mr. Anders Fogh Rasmussen, a Danish
citizen), while its military leader is the Supreme Allied Commander
Europe (SACEUR) (currently U.S. Air Force General Philip M. Breedlove).
The treaty establishes both a political and military role for the
organization.

1\. Core Mission and Article 5

**[Article 5 of the treaty states the core mission of
NATO]{.underline}**. 12 This mission is based upon article 51 of the UN
Charter, which provides for **[collective self-defense.]{.underline}**
Article 5 states as follows:

[The Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in
Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all
and consequently they agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each
of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective
self-defense recognized by article 51]{.underline} of the Charter of the
United Nations, will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking
forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such
action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to
restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area. 13

[NATO invoked the provisions of article 5]{.underline} to the treaty for
the first time in the aftermath of the 11 September 2001 attacks on the
United States. 14 NATO Operation Active Endeavor (naval operations in
support of 9/11 counterterrorism missions in the Mediterranean) was one
of the first NATO operations authorized under article 5. 15

2**[. Non-Article 5 Activity]{.underline}**

[**[Not all]{.mark} NATO [military activity]{.mark}** [can be]{.mark}
justified [under article 5]{.mark} to the treaty]{.underline}. [[NATO
member states]{.mark}]{.underline} 16 [[have an obligation to
**train**]{.mark} and **prepare for their defense**]{.underline}.
**[[This is]{.mark} articulated [in article 3]{.mark} to the
treaty]{.underline}**. 17 [The [political aspect]{.mark} of NATO is
reflected [in]{.mark} the **[article 4]{.mark}
requirement**]{.underline} [[that parties **consult** ]{.mark}**one
another**]{.underline} to resolve disputes or identify potential threats
to the alliance. 18 These authorities have been interpreted to give NATO
its own engagement activity (mirroring the activity of a U.S. combatant
command), such as the Partnership for Peace and the Mediterranean
Dialogue. 19 While article 5 is a good start point in articulating the
legal basis for traditional NATO operations, the LEGAL) may also refer
to underlying United Nations Security Council Resolutions (UNSCR) giving
authority to engage in armed conflict under Chapter VII of the UN
Charter. 20 In this light, [NATO doctrine provides for operational
responses beyond article 5 self-defense.]{.underline}

To address the multitude of security scenarios facing the alliance,
**[NATO]{.underline}** [doctrine recognizes a category of activity known
**as Non-Article 5 Crisis Response Operations**]{.underline} (NA5CRO).
21 [[**Non-Article 5 operations** cover **contingencies** that do not
**amount**]{.mark} [to a]{.mark} response to an [armed attack]{.mark} on
alliance territory]{.underline}. 22 The earliest example of this type of
operation includes the NATO-lead of the Implementation Force (IFOR) in
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 23 The doctrine states as follows:

**[If You Can't Properly Define]{.underline} Cybersecurity[, How Can You
Know What It Is?]{.underline}**

[It's clear that the cybersecurity industry hasn't been able to agree
upon what cybersecurity is and isn't. Even NIST]{.underline}, who is
responsible for the definition of technical terms used by the U.S.
Federal Government, [has four different [definitions of
cybersecurity]{.mark}! At a minimum, there are dozens of different
definitions of]{.underline} [cybersecurity currently in use. Nearly all
[are **incomplete in scope**]{.mark}, some are **horridly
[wrong]{.mark},** and nearly all [fail to differentiate between
cybersecurity and]{.mark} its **[information]{.mark} security
cousin**.]{.underline}

Background

If you look up the definition of "cybersecurity," most of the answers
you get are laughable. Most appear to be written by some "expert" with
no actual concept of what cybersecurity is. [Nearly all of those
definitions sound as though they were written by an academic
pontificating what he thinks cybersecurity theoretically should
be]{.underline}, without himself ever having done any actual hands-on
cybersecurity engineering.

Until July 2019, the sole "official" definition of cybersecurity (as
defined by NIST) was: "The ability to protect or defend the use of
cyberspace from cyber attacks." Hyper-informative, wasn't it? It's about
like telling a man who's never seen a donut that, "A donut is a pastry
shaped like a donut torus." \[See note 1.\]

Then, just when you think it can't get worse, it does. Now NIST can't
even agree within itself what cybersecurity is! It now four different
definitions of cybersecurity! None of them tell you anything
particularly useful about cybersecurity. Those definitions of
cybersecurity are: \[2\]

Prevention of damage to, protection of, and restoration of computers,
electronic communications systems, electronic communications services,
wire communication, and electronic communication, including information
contained therein, to ensure its availability, integrity,
authentication, confidentiality, and nonrepudiation.

The ability to protect or defend the use of cyberspace from cyber
attacks.

The process of protecting information by preventing, detecting, and
responding to attacks.

The prevention of damage to, unauthorized use of, exploitation of, and
--- if needed --- the restoration of electronic information and
communications systems, and the information they contain, in order to
strengthen the confidentiality, integrity and availability of these
systems.

If you search online for a definition of cybersecurity, most definitions
are just as bad --- if not worse --- than the definitions NIST provides.
Here are some examples:

Measures taken to protect a computer or computer system (as on the
Internet) against unauthorized access or attack. \[3\]

The art of protecting networks, devices, and data from unauthorized
access or criminal use and the practice of ensuring confidentiality,
integrity, and availability of information. \[4\]

May also be referred to as information technology security. \[5\]

The preventative techniques used to protect the integrity of networks,
programs and data from attack, damage, or unauthorized access. \[6\]

The practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital
attacks. \[7\]

The protection of information assets by addressing threats to
information processed, stored, and transported by internetworked
information systems. \[14\]

Notice [the pattern? The definitions all talk about defending
**computers**, **networks**, and **data**]{.underline}. [That isn't what
cybersecurity is. That's what **information security** is! Plus, the
scope is strictly digital in many cases]{.underline}. Clearly, [whoever
wrote those definitions have no experience with **industrial controls
security**, where **even analogue devices can be at risk of
attack**]{.underline}. \[8\]

We have two problems here. First, we have failed to define what
cybersecurity adequately or accurately is. Worse, [we are trying to
somehow shoehorn cybersecurity into being either the same as information
security]{.underline} or some subset of information security. It isn't,
and I'll go into detail why in a minute.

So, if we can't even agree upon what cybersecurity is, how can we
possibly expect to create reasonably secure systems and products that
depend upon an in-depth understanding of cybersecurity?

Clearly, we can't.

And, the problem is compounded by the mindset that the same tools and
techniques used for information security are applicable to
cybersecurity. Yes, most information security tools and techniques can
be applied to cybersecurity, but cybersecurity requires tools and
techniques which go far beyond those of information security.

[How can we expect to secure our systems when we are using the wrong
tools]{.underline}? Or, at best, an incomplete set of tools?

Again, clearly, we can't.

In my professional opinion, the root of the problem we're facing is that
too many "cybersecurity experts" began their careers as "information
security experts" and never have had actual hands-on cybersecurity
experience beyond applying partial aspects of cybersecurity to
information systems. Thus, we are left with information-centric
definitions of cybersecurity, where the "experts" have tried to mold
cybersecurity into the shape of information security.

Well, it's time to break that mold!

Let's get started with a few definitions.

Definitions

First, [let's define security:]{.underline}

[Security is the protection of assets from threats.]{.underline}

That's fairly clear, but let's dissect it to ensure the subtleties are
covered:

Assets are anything tangible or intangible that has value. In the
context of security, usage of the word ["asset" usually refers to a
"protected asset."]{.underline}

[Protected Assets are any asset protected by a security
service]{.underline}. Examples of protected assets could include: data
or information (electronic or physical), network and computing
infrastructure, software, products and associated intellectual property,
people (employees, customers, vendors), real estate and personal
property, and utilities and other critical infrastructure. That is,
anything of value is a potential protected asset.

Security Services are any threat reduction capability provided by
security. There are five generally recognized security services:
Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, Authenticity, and
Access-Control. (See the blog post, What Are The Fundamental Services
Provided By Security? Hint: CIA Is Not The Answer for additional
details.)

[Threats are anything with the potential to cause harm]{.underline}. For
example, the potential for an attack to occur. Threats can be either
[intentional]{.underline} (e.g., [sabotage]{.underline}) or
[accidental]{.underline} (e.g., [aircraft]{.underline} bird strike), and
they can be both [man-made events]{.underline} (e.g., [human
errors]{.underline}, cyber attacks, power failures, and network outages)
[or natural events]{.underline} (e.g., fires, floods, earthquakes,
hurricanes, and tornados). Also, see security threats, below.

Attacks are any action taken against an asset with the intention of
causing harm.

[Security Threats are anything that may cause harm to a protected
asset]{.underline} and/or associated entities. For example, whereas a
security threat that discloses personally identifiable information would
most likely inflict minimal harm to the asset that held the disclosed
information, the disclosure itself could do considerable harm to both
the organization's brand and to the individuals whose information was
disclosed. There are seven generally recognized categories of security
threats: Denial of Access, Forgery, Spoofing, Repudiation, Unauthorized
Access, Unauthorized Disclosure, and Unauthorized Modification (see blog
post referenced in Security Services for more details.).

Entities, in the context of security, are anything that attempts to use
a protected asset. An entity can be a person, software, robot, or
anything else that attempts to use a protected asset.

Okay, I lied: That definition has a lot of subtly buried within it.
Hopefully, now the definition of security has a deeper meaning for you.

So, that's the definition of the mission of security across all of the
organization's security domains. In most organizations, [there should be
three top-level security domains]{.underline}:

**[Corporate Security]{.underline}**

**[Information Security]{.underline}**

**[Cyber Security]{.underline}**

Now, let's define each of those security domains.

Corporate Security

[Corporate Security is those aspects of an organization's security not
directly related to technology]{.underline}.

That is, in general, [corporate security is those aspects of security
that pre-date technology or technological security solutions, or are
unrelated to technology]{.underline}. Falling under the corporate
security domain would be aspects of security related to employee
services, safety, environmental services, or facilities; or which are
intellectual property, legal, or regulatory in nature. (This is not an
all-inclusive list.)

In other words, much of what you would think of as an organization's
security before the advent of digital technologies falls into the
corporate security domain.

Today, corporate security often makes extensive use of technology. But,
corporate security's technology is often not under the auspices of
information security or cybersecurity. Without close collaboration
between security groups, serious gaps in security defenses will occur.

Worse, [there often isn't a corporate security group in the
organization]{.underline}. Instead, you often find aspects of corporate
security disbursed between multiple (and, often non-communicating)
groups, such as human resources, facilities, safety, plant protection,
legal, risk management, and environmental.

I plan to discuss corporate security in more detail in an upcoming blog
post, Corporate Security: The Forgotten Security Domain.

Information Security

[Information Security is the protection of information in any form and
at all times]{.underline}.

That's pretty much the classic paragraph-long definition of information
security, summarized into one sentence.

Now, let's dissect it to get a deeper understanding of what that means.

Security is the protection of assets from threats.

Protection is the rendering safe from harm. Protection is passive
security. That is, security that does not offer a response to an attack.
It is equivalent to putting a lock on a door to secure your house.

In any form means it includes both physical (e.g., printed documents)
and electronic (e.g., files and databases) information.

At all times means the information must be protected, whether it is at
rest (i.e., in storage), in use, or in motion (e.g., electronic
information sent over a network, or a printed document transported by a
courier).

Thus, we define information security as the protection of information.
Note that we didn't place any constraints upon the scope of protection.
That is, if we have to protect computers and networks to protect
information, then that would be within the scope of information
security. But, keep in mind that the objective is the protection of
information. Nothing more. Nothing less.

Cyber Security

We've already shown that there isn't a commonly agreed-to definition for
cybersecurity. Now, [I'm going to propose a definition for cybersecurity
which covers all aspects of cybersecurity]{.underline} --- something
which is lacking from other definitions --- [while providing a clear
distinction from information security.]{.underline} \[10\]

[[Cybersecurity is]{.mark} the **[protection]{.mark}** and defense [of
**both analogue and digital electronic devices**]{.mark}]{.underline},
**[their [communications channels]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and [their
**[processing-and-control logic and algorithms]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Now, let's dissect that definition to get a deeper understanding of what
it means and its ramifications.

Security is the protection of assets from threats.

Protection is the rendering safe from harm. Protection is passive
security. That is, security that does not offer a response to an attack.
It is equivalent to putting a lock on a door to secure your house.

Defense is an action taken to resist an attack. Defense is active
security. This means that you have dynamic security with ever-changing
defenses --- which can include offensive actions to stop an attack. It
is the equivalent of confronting an intruder in your house with a loaded
weapon.

Digital Devices are any electronic device that uses discrete data and
processes for all its operations. This clearly includes computers, cell
phones and tablets, routers, switches, WiFi access points, and
firewalls, but it also includes all other digitally networked devices,
such as all IoT devices, VoIP telephones, digital security cameras,
smart badge readers, etc.

Analogue Devices are any electronic device that uses continuous data and
processes for all its operations. This would include landline
telephones, fax machines, most nuclear reactor control systems, older
radar systems, older industrial controls, some satellite and other space
systems controls, and literally thousands of other devices. In
industrial controls situations, analogue devices often serve as failsafe
backups to digital controls.

Communications Channels are the means by which a device is connected to
other devices. For analogue device communications, this could be a
simple wire or wire-pair, coax cable, analogue radio, or similar
technologies. For digital device communications, it would include any
type of wired or wireless network. For digital to analogue device
communications, it could include any of the previously mentioned means
of analogue device communications used to communicate to an analogue
interface in the digital device.

Processing Logic and Algorithms are the means by which a device
accomplishes its designated purpose. For analogue devices, this is all
done in hardware. For digital devices, this includes both hardware and
software (microcode, firmware, operating systems, applications, etc.).

Control Logic and Algorithms are the means by which a device regulates
its processing. For analogue devices, this is all done in hardware. For
digital devices, this includes both hardware and software (microcode,
firmware, operating systems, applications, etc.).

Now, let's put the phrases together and detail the bigger picture.

[Is the protection and defense is cybersecurity's first significant
difference from information security. Cybersecurity not only offers
protection like information security, but it also offers defense. In
other words, [cybersecurity can take]{.mark} the [offensive
actions]{.mark} necessary [to defend]{.mark} systems]{.underline}.

Of both analogue and digital electronic devices is the next significant
difference from information security, as information security's tools
seldom address analogue devices. It is also different in that
information security offers protection of non-electronic information
(e.g., printed), whereas cybersecurity only deals with electronic
devices and their data. \[11\]

This definition means that protection and defense are also offered to
the electronic devices (components) combined to construct a more complex
electronic device. For example, protection and defense would be offered
to CPUs, GPU, FPGAs, ASICs, NICs, DACs, memory, controllers, and all the
other various analogue and digital components that comprise a modern
end-purpose electronic device, such as a smartphone or a computer. In
other words, cybersecurity protects and defends any security-sensitive
electronic device, be it analogue or digital, and be it an end-purpose
device or a component of such a device.

Their communications channels is again a difference between
cybersecurity and information security. Cybersecurity provides both
protection and defense of the electronic communications channels
themselves, both analogue and digital. Whereas, information security
only provides for the protection of the information conveyed over those
communications channels.

Additionally, [[info]{.mark}rmation [security]{.mark} also provides for
the protection of information communicated by non-electronic
means]{.underline} (e.g., printed documents), **[which [is outside the
scope of cybersecurity]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

And their processing-and-control logic and algorithms is the final
difference between cybersecurity and information security. Cybersecurity
offers protections to both hardware and software, and can take actions
to defend both from attack. By contrast, **[information security only
provides passive protection to information.]{.underline}**

So, that is the definition of cybersecurity and an explanation of its
scope.

To recap, cybersecurity provides security for all electronic technology,
except for the information processed by such technology (information is
protected by information security).

Or, another way to view the difference between information security and
cybersecurity is that information security secures the information
itself, and cybersecurity secures everything that creates, uses,
processes, stores, or communicates that information.

Where Information Security Fails Us

In my blog introduction, I state that "trying to treat cybersecurity
problems as though they are information security problems" is one of the
fundamental mistakes we are making in security today. The lack of an
understanding of the differences between information security and
cybersecurity is the root cause of this problem.

As we have seen in the preceding definitions, [information security is
"data-centric," and cybersecurity is "device-centric.]{.underline}"
Trying to apply information security principals to "device security"
creates two problems: First, you can't adequately secure "hardware"
using the same controls used to secure data; And second, there is
nothing in information security that provides for an active defense.

Let's look at some of the issues that the premises supporting
information security fail to address. To do this, we'll examine an
example from product security.

[The overwhelming **insecurity**]{.underline} [of **IoT** products has
filled the news recently]{.underline}. Why? Many would say that it's a
simple matter of companies trying to produce products on the cheap.
However, I would argue that [the]{.underline} [issue is more likely the
product's designers' failure to recognize the potential for security
problems in their products.]{.underline}

I believe that fundamentally, such product failures are compounded by an
incomplete view of security: a view driven by an information security
focus. A focus that, for embedded systems products (such as IoT
devices), is incomplete, at best. Why incomplete? Because [most security
issues with IoT devices are not information related. Rather the problems
are with the devices themselves.]{.underline}

Let's begin by listing some of the security questions that product
designers should be asking, but are obviously not asking. And, with most
product security practitioners coming from an information security
background, those product security architects probably do not even know
they should be asking these questions.

After all, why should they know better? Nothing they had learned in the
scope of information security would indicate that these are issues with
which to be concerned. The types of product security questions (that is,
cybersecurity questions) which all product security architects should be
asking include:

How do you prevent reverse engineering of the product?

How do you prevent tampering with the product?

How do you prevent the production of unlicensed clones of the product?

How do you prevent access to the hardware interfaces used for
development debugging of the product?

How do you prevent access to the hardware interfaces used for
manufacturing testing of the product?

How do you perform failsafe firmware updates of the product (such that a
failed update does not brick the product)?

How do you prevent unauthorized modification of the product's firmware?

How do you prevent your firmware from running on third-party devices?

How do you ensure the integrity of your supply chain?

How do you prevent unauthorized modification of the device itself?

How do you prevent misuse of the device from damaging the device itself
(e.g., using a USB port on a device for other than its intended purpose,
and drawing too much power)?

How do you prevent misuse of the device from creating a safety incident
(e.g., using an aerosol can to create a vapor fog to trigger a motion
detector to unlock a door)?

How can this device be abused by an attacker to cause harm?

How can we verify that our UI is always unambiguous to its intended
audience?

How can we verify that our UX is always intuitive to its intended
audience?

How can we verify that our UI creates neither security or safety issues?

How can we verify that our ID creates neither security or safety issues?

And this is just a very small sample of the questions that every product
development organization should be asking, but which is clearly failing
to occur.

Now, I can already hear the objections: "These are hardware engineering
issues, not information security issues, and that's why they're not
covered by information security." Well, that's half wrong and half
right. Wrong, in that they are not hardware engineering issues; rather,
they are hardware security issues. Right, in that they are not
information security issues; rather, they are cybersecurity issues.
\[12\]

These, and tens of thousands of other similar issues, are being left
unaddressed during product development because information security
doesn't address these types of issues. Nor should it, as those issues
are cybersecurity issues and not information security issues.

Nothing in an information security professional's background or training
would prepare them to even know that they should be asking the types of
questions I posited. And, that's what should be expected, because these
are not information security issues and I would not expect an
information security professional even to have half-a-clue that such
problems exist. It's for precisely this reason that cybersecurity exists
and is different from information security.

The problem is really simple: **[Information security exists to protect
information]{.underline}**. Nothing in the fundamentals of information
security was ever intended to secure anything other than information.
Thus, we need to stop trying to use an information security mindset to
secure "stuff" that isn't information. We must recognize that
cybersecurity's scope is beyond that of information security, and thus
apply cybersecurity principals to cybersecurity problems.

Defense

We also need to remember that [cybersecurity]{.underline} [allows for
active measures to defend devices. There's a reason that the military
and intelligence agencies refer to their security operations as
cybersecurity, and that's because they take active countermeasures to
attacks]{.underline}. You don't do that when your objective is to secure
information. In fact, that entire concept is an anathema to the
information security principals and mindset.

Cybersecurity defense is a big rabbit hole I don't plan to explore
further in this posting, other than to remind you that cybersecurity's
objective is the protection and defense of assets.

Summary

There is an old saying, "When the only tool you have is a hammer,
everything looks like a nail." With no real cybersecurity experience,
too many information security experts are trying to hammer cybersecurity
into becoming an information security nail. We need to reset the
thinking of those information security professionals and teach them that
cybersecurity is more like a bolt than a nail, and that you use a
wrench, not a hammer, when installing or removing a bolt.

Now, a quick review...

In most organizations, there are three security domains with which it
must be concerned:

Corporate Security, which protects (and sometimes defends) people; and
real, corporate, and intellectual property.

Information Security, which protects information (data).

Cybersecurity, which protects and defends: hardware, communications, and
software.

The diagram below illustrates those relationships among the
organization's security domains.

![Security Domain
Relationships](media/image4.jpeg){width="4.16971019247594in"
height="3.374405074365704in"}

We established the following definitions in support of those security
domains:

Security is the protection of assets from threats.

Corporate Security is those aspects of an organization's security not
directly related to technology.

Information Security is the protection of information in any form and at
all times.

Cybersecurity is the protection and defense of both analogue and digital
electronic devices, their communications channels, and their
processing-and-control logic and algorithms.

Trying to treat cybersecurity problems as though they are information
security problems is one of the fundamental mistakes we are making in
security today. We have to remember that information security is
"data-centric," and cybersecurity is "device-centric." Trying to apply
information security principals to "device security" creates two
problems:

You cannot adequately secure "hardware" using the same controls used to
secure data, and

[There is nothing in information security that provides for active
defense.]{.underline}

If you search the Internet, you will find that many so-called
"information security experts" claim that cybersecurity is a subset of
information security. But, compared to information security,
cybersecurity has a substantially broader scope, addresses a more
complex set of security threats, and offers active defenses not provided
by information security.

If anything, we should view information security as a subset of
cybersecurity. However, that's not accurate either, as what those two
domains are attempting to secure is different --- data vs. hardware,
software, and communications. Some overlap between the two is
unavoidable, but at the most fundamental levels, they are attempting to
solve different problems. \[13\]

Thus, we need clear, concise, unambiguous definitions of both
cybersecurity and information security.

Hopefully, you will find the definitions provided here meet those
criteria.

So, don't let alleged information security experts try to tell you what
is and is not cybersecurity! Those so-called "information security
experts" are precisely that, and nothing more, because they clearly do
not understand cybersecurity!

Please leave cybersecurity to actual cybersecurity practitioners.

Thank you!
