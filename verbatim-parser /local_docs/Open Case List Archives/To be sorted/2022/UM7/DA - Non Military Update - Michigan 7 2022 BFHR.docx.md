Since Democrats assumed unified control of government in Washington last
January, many of Congress's highest-profile investigations have been
beset by partisan conflict. The House's effort to investigate the
insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, for example, is now being
led by a select committee that has only two Republican members---both
named by Democrats. That move came after the House GOP leadership pulled
its entire slate of recommended committee members in response to a
refusal by Speaker Nancy Pelosi to empanel several proponents of the
"Big Lie" about the 2020 election.

But House committees' oversight of the executive branch extends far
beyond these headline-grabbing issues. [Even amid]{.underline} House
Democrats' often [contentious oversight]{.underline} of the Trump
administration in 2019 and 2020, occasional **[bipartisan investigations
emerged]{.underline}**---and an early look at the 117th Congress to date
suggests [oversight can still be **bipartisan** even during **high
partisan conflict**]{.underline}.

Over the first six months of the 117th Congress (January-June 2021),
House [committees sent **128 letters**]{.underline} to agencies and
other actors as part of efforts [to oversee the executive
branch]{.underline}. Twenty-nine percent of these letters were
bipartisan, meaning both the Democratic chair and Republican ranking
member signed the letter. This is a noticeable increase in
bipartisanship from the 116th Congress, where, in several comparable
periods, the share of oversight letters that were bipartisan was much
lower. For example, during the first six months of the 116th Congress
(January-June 2019), House Democrats sent 363 executive branch oversight
letters, of which only 7% were bipartisan.

There are several possible explanations for this shift. With a
Republican president in the White House in 2019, Republican ranking
members may have been less willing to join oversight of a same-party
president than they are now to conduct oversight of a Democratic
president. The transition from a Republican president to a Democratic
one may also be driving a drop in the number of executive branch
oversight letters between the first six months of 2019, when 363 of
these were sent by Democratic-led committees, and the first six months
of 2021, when only 128 were. (This trend is consistent with historical
evidence that indicates House committees are less interested in
aggressive oversight of the same party that holds the House majority.)

There is also reason to think that the COVID-19 pandemic may have
influenced bipartisanship in oversight as well. After the start of the
COVID-19 pandemic midway through the 116th Congress, there was more
oversight of the executive branch but less bipartisanship in that
oversight, possibly a result of the politization of the pandemic
response. As House Democrats ramped up their oversight investigations
into the Trump administration's handling of COVID-19, the share of
oversight letters that were bipartisan fell from 8% to 3%. The looming
election in November 2020 likely contributed to this trend as well;
Republicans who might have otherwise joined Democratic efforts to
oversee the executive branch's handling of the pandemic may have been
more reluctant to do so in an election year.

BIPARTISANSHIP IS NOT REALIZED EQUALLY

In the period under study here, the majority of bipartisan oversight
letters come from just a few committees. So far this year, the Committee
on Oversight and Reform has sent the most oversight letters that are
bipartisan, accounting for 65% of the total bipartisan letters sent by
House committees. The Energy and Commerce Committee, the clear leader in
bipartisan oversight in the 116th Congress, is tied for second place in
the 117th Congress, having sent five bipartisan letters thus far. (While
this relative decline may have several causes, one possible explanation
involves turnover in the Republican ranking member position between the
two congresses.) Having a few committees engage in most of the
bipartisanship is consistent with the 116th Congress, where three
committees sent roughly half (54%) of the 74 total bipartisan oversight
letters.

In both congresses, the large numbers of letters attributed to these
committees largely stem from a few investigations in which many letters
are sent at once. For example, 23 of the 24 letters sent by the
Oversight and Reform Committee in the 117th Congress were a part of a
single investigation into the functioning of federal inspectors general.
When counting each of these "letter dumps" as one data point, House
committees have started a total of 11 bipartisan inquiries so far in the
117th Congress. The Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure is
responsible for almost half of these investigations, conducting five
distinct bipartisan inquiries throughout the 117th Congress to date.

This variation in how often committees engage in bipartisan oversight
may have several explanations, but it does not seem to be neatly related
to how ideologically different the Democratic and Republican committee
leaders are. When we use a conventional political science measure of
members' relative ideological position, the majority of bipartisan
investigations are occurring in committees with neither the most
ideologically similar nor the most ideologically different chairs and
ranking members.

Bipartisanship in congressional [oversight]{.underline} is important not
for some intrinsic reason, but because bipartisan engagement on an issue
[can be a signal that members are fulfilling their institutional role as
a **counterweight** to the executive branch]{.underline}. To be sure,
some of the bipartisan oversight work undertaken in the 117th Congress
is likely the result of Republicans rediscovering an interest in
checking a Democratic president. But a willingness of Democrats to
investigate policy implementation by an executive branch controlled by
their own party---and to do so in a way that sees some Republicans
joining them---is an important indicator of Congress taking its
institutional responsibilities seriously.

The current era of hyperpartisanship means that there are fewer
high-profile issues that compel members of both parties to conduct
thorough investigations together. But, as the emerging congressional
attention to the withdrawal from Afghanistan indicates, they do emerge
occasionally. [Whether Congress can **build** on some of the **trends**
in bipartisanship]{.underline} discussed here [and **follow through** on
the **initial indication** of bipartisan interest in **serious
oversight** remains to be seen]{.underline}.

Contributes to the militarization of foreign policy

[The current security assistance system contributes to the
**militarization**]{.underline} [of U.S. foreign policy]{.underline}.
Militarizing foreign policy entails the increasing [use of the military
to solve foreign policy challenges and results in a **bloated** DOD
budget with **more resources** and **authority**]{.underline}.
Researchers describe it as a phenomenon whereby "[the military **more
and more**]{.underline} [becomes the **primary actor** and face of U.S.
policy abroad]{.underline}," leading to a cycle in which the DOD
requires and receives significantly more resources than any other
foreign policy agency and is thus increasingly relied on to solve U.S.
foreign policy problems.62 There are several elements of a militarized
foreign policy in today's security assistance system, but primarily,
[the DOD's control of]{.underline} significantly more security
assistance [resources puts the Pentagon]{.underline}---[rather than
diplomats]{.underline}---[in the **driver's seat** in
policymaking]{.underline}.

The Pentagon's significant resources also distort the face of U.S.
security assistance on the ground. Gordon Adams, a former White House
budget official, warned, "[Who owns the ball matters here because it
colors the way the U.S. engages overseas]{.underline}. If American
engagement wears a uniform ... that's one form of interaction. [If it
involves the ambassador]{.underline} and the \[U.S. Agency for
International Development\] [and people doing governance work, it's a
different set of missions and there's a hugely different
perception]{.underline}."63 Recipient countries can utilize this to
their advantage; foreign officials may more eagerly seek to follow
through or make progress on DOD requests or priorities, such as going
through with a significant military exercise or a ship visit, while
ignoring or slow-rolling State Department requests or priorities, such
as releasing a dissident or altering an economic regulation. And if the
interlocutor that matters in relations with the United States is the
military, the subject that matters is defense. The Pentagon's priorities
can therefore end up carrying more importance with partners than the
State Department's broader foreign policy concerns, making combatant
commands more powerful than any diplomat. [When the State Department is
**deprived of resources**, or **cut out**]{.underline} [of the
decision-making process **entirely**, diplomats cannot **effectively
weigh in**]{.underline} [on whether a proposed sale]{.underline} or
package [makes sense given]{.underline} a range of other **[nonmilitary
concerns]{.underline}** that may exist in a bilateral relationship. In
short, **[money is power]{.underline}**, and the DOD has the money.

The net effect is that [U.S. foreign policy is **less coherent**, with
Pentagon policy]{.underline} more likely to be [**out of sync** with
broader foreign policy concerns]{.underline}. For example, the DOD's
U.S. Africa Command posture review is being conducted with little to no
coordination with the State Department, and the rumored outcome is to
call for reduced U.S. presence and security investments in order to free
up DOD resources to focus on competition with Russia and China.64 Yet
the United States still has serious security and geopolitical interests
in the continent that are likely not reflected in traditional
military-only decision-making. Rachel Stohl, managing director at the
Stimson Center, warned that developing military-to-military security
assistance programs is "an important relationship, one that should be
cultivated, but it is not separate from the diplomatic and foreign
policy relationships that have to be developed and take time. [If you
lose the foreign policy piece and just focus on]{.underline} the
[security]{.underline} piece, [you're doing a disservice to the **larger
strategic objectives**]{.underline}."65 [The]{.underline} siloed
security assistance [system leads to **disjointed** U.S. foreign policy,
divorces security concerns from **broader**]{.underline} [economic or
**diplomatic** concerns, and can end up promoting **militarized
solutions**]{.underline}.

Perpetuates the status quo in security relationships

The current security assistance framework at the State Department and
the DOD often perpetuates the status quo by creating incentives to
continue providing assistance to the same partners. Between
congressionally mandated allocations to large security partners in the
State Department's FMF assistance and specific authorities created for
certain countries, there are often few built-in incentives to reexamine
a partner's record or backsliding. And when reviews are done, there is
strong resistance to shift funding due to the potential fallout. Rarely
is the top consideration the effectiveness of assistance. In an
interview with the authors in June 2020, Anthony Wier, a former deputy
assistant secretary in the State Department's Bureau of Legislative
Affairs, explained, "Right now, the best predictor for what we propose
to spend this year is what we proposed last year -- in other words, the
whole system is basically just drifting from year to year."66

This greatly affects the perception of other U.S. security assistance
partners. Countries know that the United States is unlikely to cut
assistance, even despite bad behavior, in order to avoid harming a
bilateral relationship. Recipients take note of such reluctance to pull
aid even when gross abuses occur and thus ignore U.S. chastising on bad
behavior. As long as the United States is unwilling to cut off
assistance or move funds elsewhere after a country commits actions that
U.S. officials oppose, security assistance will provide no foreign
policy leverage.

[Harms **democratic progress**]{.underline} [and enables **human
rights** violators]{.underline}

[Current security assistance policy, divorced from other foreign aid
considerations, hampers]{.underline} pursuing this
**[values-based]{.underline}** [policy and does not]{.underline}
effectively [elevate human rights and democracy concerns]{.underline} in
the decision-making process. This is dangerous because [the United
States ends up supporting **autocratic regimes** with serious
**governance** and **stability** challenges]{.underline}. Yemen, for
example, received more than \$300 million in security assistance through
the DOD's train and equip authority between 2010 and 2015, yet
researchers documented human rights abuses perpetrated by the government
and possible diversion of U.S. aid.67 Worse still, the perception that
U.S. aid was fueling conflict led much of the Yemeni public to believe
that the United States was primarily responsible for the destruction of
the Saudi-led coalition in the current war.68 Today, the conflict in
Yemen is the world's worst humanitarian crisis.

[An overly militarized security assistance policy makes it harder to
support **emerging democracies**]{.underline}. [Building up security
forces without]{.underline} accompanying [reforms to strengthen
**civilian oversight**]{.underline} [can lead to **coup-proofing** or
**consolidation**]{.underline} around a political leader, rather than
the development of a competent force.69 Often, these impacts are not
prioritized by security assistance practitioners; for example, the DOD's
relative spending on building up partner security institutions, such as
the Defense Institution Reform Initiative, was \$32.6 million in fiscal
year 2019, compared with \$1.9 billion of overall spending.70 At the
same time, the DOD's investment in institutional capacity building far
exceeds the State Department's investment in these efforts---an example
where the State Department will have to incorporate and improve on the
DOD's practices.

While U.S. laws technically prohibit providing security assistance to
units found to violate human rights---the Leahy laws---the provisions
are riddled with loopholes and are too weak to effectively prioritize
human rights in U.S. security assistance.71 Offices and agencies
responsible for elevating human rights in U.S. foreign policy, such as
the State Department's Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, are
too often cut out of the decision-making process for security assistance
programs---especially those run out of the Pentagon. At the same time,
the Pentagon maintains its own security assistance accounts, such as
Section 127e, that are not required to conduct human rights vetting and
operate with little transparency---furthering opportunities to
militarize foreign policy.72 And often, such as in the case of Egypt,
security assistance is accompanied by paltry amounts of democracy, human
rights, and governance funding (DRG), or [certifications on human rights
are **waived entirely**]{.underline}, to make providing arms more
palatable.73 These small DRG funds or certification stops do little to
change the underlying political challenges or are sometimes even
hampered by the regime the United States is funding.

Inhibits congressional oversight

By creating two separate security assistance bureaucracies---one at the
State Department and one at the DOD---[there is no **uniform
oversight**]{.underline} [of security assistance by
**Congress**]{.underline}. [**DOD** security assistance residing in
**Title 10**]{.underline} [is a relatively **tiny**
piece]{.underline}---comprising about 2 percent [of the]{.underline}
overall DOD [budget]{.underline}---of the oversight jurisdiction for the
Senate and House Armed Services committees and DOD appropriators.
[Meanwhile]{.underline}, the [assistance under State Department
authorities comprises a **far more significant** proportion]{.underline}
of the State Department budget---about 15 percent---[and therefore can
be subject to **more expert attention**]{.underline}.

[Congressional staff are **expected** to review a **continuous
flow**]{.underline} [of **piecemeal** security assistance notifications
from the executive branch and track reports about the **myriad
authorities**]{.underline}. Many [congressional staff report being
**unable** to **keep up** with reviewing even the biggest
program]{.underline}, and reports---even those made public---are rarely
reviewed in any depth.74 Moreover, these [committees **rarely** talk to
each other or **coordinate**]{.underline} over specific security
assistant programs. They also jealously guard their jurisdictions and
have a poor track record of communication, let alone cooperation.75

As a result, [security assistance **rarely** gets a **vetting** before
the **public eye**]{.underline}. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee
has held two hearings on security assistance in the last 10 years---and
tends to focus on the foreign policy dimensions of the most problematic
partnerships.76 Congressional notification requirements are not uniform
and only mandated for certain types of authorities, making it impossible
to see a "full and authoritative accounting" of U.S. security assistance
funding around the world.77

[Contributes to an **inefficient bureaucracy** and **coordination
nightmare**]{.underline}

Because of the patchwork of existing authorities to provide security
assistance, there are multiple systems for U.S. officials in Washington
and on the ground in embassies to manage. For the security assistance
system to work effectively, U.S. officials at the State Department, the
Pentagon, and in the field need to closely coordinate---but this does
not always happen in the current structure. [Military
officers]{.underline} conducting and implementing security assistance
[have to **juggle** multiple security assistance programs with different
types of **reporting requirements**, human rights **vetting standards**,
and **administrative barriers**, while also being beholden to two chains
of command]{.underline}---[the **ambassador** and the **combatant
command**]{.underline}---[with sometimes **divergent
perspectives**]{.underline}.

Moreover, focusing only on formal congressional action obscures the more
subtle but substantial ways in which Congress influences decisions about
military intervention. Crucially, the fact that the president often
initiates military campaigns without express authorization by Congress
does not mean that congressional checks are altogether absent. Political
science and history strongly suggest that, notwithstanding the
often-weak electoral incentives of congressional members to formally
approve or disapprove military interventions at their outset,
congressional politics weigh heavily in presidential decision-making.

[**Studies** show]{.underline} that **[congressional
politics]{.underline}** [affect]{.underline} both [the
**frequency**]{.underline} [with which presidents use force]{.underline}
abroad [and the **probability**]{.underline} that [they will respond
militarily]{.underline} to crises. There are many ways in which
[Congress influences]{.underline} presidential uses of force, which
[include]{.underline} not only the introduction of legislation to
authorize or curtail a use of force but also [congressional oversight
**hearings**]{.underline} [and influencing **public
debate**]{.underline} [over military policymaking]{.underline}.
[Congressional action]{.underline} or inaction also [sends signals about
**domestic resolve**]{.underline} [to]{.underline} foreign parties ---
both [**adversaries** and **allies**]{.underline} alike --- thereby
[affecting the **president's calculus**]{.underline} regarding using
force. Such political checks are especially pronounced when Congress and
the presidency are controlled by opposing parties. Focusing solely on
whether and how Congress formally approves military action on the front
end often neglects these other significant ways Congress can influence
the use of force and how they might be enhanced.

The Diverse Forms of Modern Conflict

Military conflicts and interventions arise in too many ways and forms to
regulate them effectively with a single statutory scheme or a single
form of authorization. For the existing War Powers Resolution and some
of the proposals to strengthen it, relatively clear lines are often seen
as a virtue, because they reduce --- though don't eliminate ---
opportunities to interpret away requirements. However, trying to draw
statutory lines at specific thresholds like armed "hostilities" (as in
the War Powers Resolution) or "significant armed conflicts" (as in the
proposed War Powers Consultation Act) is a poor way of deciding which
types of conflicts should require formal congressional approval.

From the earliest days of the republic, the United States faced varied
military contingencies for which neither war declarations nor simple
congressional force authorizations were well suited. [In the **modern
era**, American **conflicts** and **security crises** are even more
**diverse**]{.underline}. They could begin because of [a U.S. first
strike or an enemy **first strike**, an attack by or against a U.S.
**ally**, or a breakdown in **deterrence** or a
**miscalculation**]{.underline}. [They might include]{.underline}
**[large-scale]{.underline}** ground [wars]{.underline}, one-off
airstrikes, or a combination of the two, and increasingly they feature
cyber operations as well. They can be overt or covert, or both. They may
be geographically confined or global, or expected to be short or long.
They are waged against states or nonstate groups, with or against a
state's proxy forces, and with or without the help of allies.

Recent controversies over war powers illustrate this point. In 2019,
concerns about insufficiently checked presidential war powers have
arisen in three vastly different contexts: continuation of a
geographically [**sprawling** and **indefinite** war]{.underline}
against terrorist groups, support for a Saudi war in Yemen, and [the
possibility of a **major** U.S. war with **Iran**]{.underline}. The
first began after a direct attack on the U.S. homeland, the second is a
regional proxy [war]{.underline}, and the third [could arise through
deliberate preemptive U.S. action, a miscalculated **spiral of
violence**]{.underline}, or some other way. Stepping back, the key
policy questions about force in each case differ widely. The first is
mostly about where and what type of force is used, the second has to do
with whether to cut off operational support to a partner, and the third
is about how to wield threats of force for deterrence and coercive
diplomacy.

Although recent war powers debates have sometimes focused on regional
conflicts in which the United States does not put many troops directly
in harm's way (at least not initially), a key aim of war powers reform
is often said to be making sure that "big" wars --- those that put many
vulnerable American boots on the ground --- are formally authorized by
Congress. Historically, however, the Korean War stands out as the only
exception to the tendency of presidents to seek congressional
authorization in advance of large ground wars. In any event, these are
the types of conflicts for which political checks often work most
effectively.

Smaller-scale and less visible conflicts attract less public attention,
but their consequences can be significant. "As a matter of democratic
principle," Jack Goldsmith and I have argued, treating low-intensity
warfare waged stealthily and from a distance (or in cyberspace) as more
appropriately conducted unilaterally than large-scale ground campaigns
"probably has matters backwards":

Light-footprint warfare is still lethal and very consequential warfare,
and the lightness of the tools make them relatively easy for a President
to deploy extensively. [Light-footprint warfare]{.underline} thus [has
large **foreign policy**]{.underline}, **[strategic]{.underline}**, [and
**reputational**]{.underline} [consequences for the United
States]{.underline}, akin to much heavier deployments, yet much less
public examination. The President's legal theories treat this as a
feature of such warfare. But [it is]{.underline} also [a **bug** for
U.S. democracy]{.underline}, since the stealthy features mean that
public debate and political checks---which reduce error as well as
excess, and promote legitimacy---function ineffectively.

This arguably indicates the need to expand or clarify the War Powers
Resolution's definition of the situations requiring explicit
congressional approval. But any politically plausible attempts to
delineate with bright-line rules which types of military action require
specific forms of congressional authorization will probably function
poorly in practice, where contextual variables are complex and
fast-moving. Such attempts may also still exclude those conflicts for
which stronger congressional scrutiny is appropriate. Alternatively, a
more flexible legal standard would likely be even easier for the
executive branch to bypass. A wide range of **[military
conflicts]{.underline}** and challenges [warrant]{.underline} a wide
range of congressional [oversight]{.underline} tools. Moreover, as
explained below, requiring congressional approval at the beginning of a
military intervention often fails to encourage the right kind of
congressional scrutiny.

The Purposes of Legislative Checks

Periodic pushes from both members of Congress and the public for
stronger congressional checks on war powers can conceal divisions and
uncertainty about why those checks are needed. Some of the goals of
these efforts for congressional oversight also point to different
solutions.

Sometimes, supporters of war powers reform are pushing for change simply
as a matter of constitutional principle. If one believes that Article
I's directive that Congress has the power to declare war includes any
use of military force (other than in defending against invasion), and
one believes that the president's Article II roles as chief executive
and commander-in-chief confer no authority to initiate such actions,
then nothing short of formal congressional authorization for any
military intervention is likely to be satisfactory. But there have
always been gaps and ambiguities in these constitutional clauses, and
many (though not all) war powers reformers believe in evolving
constitutional interpretation to meet evolving national conditions in
other areas of law. There are good arguments to justify adapting the
original allocations of military powers given the dramatic changes over
200 years in American military power, strategy, and interests, as well
as dramatic changes in the way other, related constitutional powers are
exercised. Reasonable people may disagree about the strength of those
arguments and even whether they work in favor of or against presidential
discretion, but rigid formalism does not point toward a practical
solution.

Other proponents of stronger and formal congressional checks justify
them in policy terms: Imposing legislative requirements would help to
restrain military adventurism. The expectation here is often that the
need to obtain congressional authorization serves as a brake on military
responses to crises, whether because Congress is slower to act than the
executive branch or because it is more sensitive to certain costs and
risks, or just because more procedural hurdles means less action.
Strategically, though, foreign policy retrenchment --- or even
perceptions of it --- carries its own dangers. How well requirements for
formal congressional force authorization contribute to peace and
stability is also far from clear, since some conflicts stem from
breakdowns in deterrence. Politically, commitment to this goal is also
often tied to who holds presidential office, and is therefore fleeting.

A third justification for war powers reform is that requiring
congressional authorization promotes sounder policy through interbranch
deliberation. Such requirements, the argument often goes, push the
executive and legislative branches to consult one another more
thoroughly, and the processes of persuasion and consensus-building
result in more consistent and sustainable security policy. This claim
has logical appeal, though empirical support is uneven. The 1991 and
2003 Iraq Wars were both authorized: The second turned out to be badly
misguided and congressional scrutiny of the first failed to question
core planning assumptions that turned out to be wrong. In any event, [a
legislative overhaul is **not needed**]{.underline} [to achieve better
interbranch deliberation]{.underline}.

Improving Legislative Oversight

For all of these reasons, war powers reform should not focus on
strengthening any single, formal congressional approval requirement.
Instead, [Congress should improve the use of its **existing tool set**
for overseeing security and defense policy]{.underline}. As noted above,
Congress has a range of tools available to shape and restrain military
policy. These include hearings, spending bills, and actions to shape
public opinion. Importantly and [unlike legislative overhaul
proposals]{.underline}, some of [these tools do not require Congress as
a whole to act]{.underline} --- [they can be wielded by]{.underline}
**[individual members]{.underline}**, especially [in key committee
positions]{.underline}. In recent years, Congress' foreign policy and
defense committees have atrophied, holding fewer oversight hearings than
in the past. A first step to boosting influence is ensuring that foreign
relations, armed services, and intelligence committee members have
adequate experience and resources, as well as a commitment to shaping
and auditing security strategy.

[Wars **rarely begin** out of the blue, but instead are the result of a
**long series**]{.underline} [of]{.underline} steps and counter-steps,
[actions and inactions]{.underline}. This means that [Congress needs to
**focus** more heavily on **overall military strategy**]{.underline}
[and how American **military resources**]{.underline} [are wielded
**well in advance** of a crisis]{.underline}, rather than treating the
outbreak of a crisis as Congress' moment for influence. Regularly
scheduled posture hearings and annual defense authorization bills, for
example, should be understood and treated as core parts of Congress' war
powers.

Fixating on congressional authorization of conflicts risks distracting
or relieving lawmakers from the important duty of overseeing their
conduct. Recent authorized wars in Afghanistan and Iraq show that
congressional action at the front end of a conflict does not equate to
thorough scrutiny --- let alone consensus --- of whether means and ends
are well aligned or planning assumptions well tested. Congressional
oversight of military intervention and conflict should be continuous and
focused more heavily on the conduct of campaigns long after their
initiation. So, for instance, the outdated 2001 Authorization for Use of
Military Force directed at al-Qaeda and its allies ought to be revised,
but as an addition to, not a substitute for, unremitting congressional
review of how the various parts of that conflict are waged. The energy
of reformists in Congress would be better spent on overseeing ongoing
conflicts than on pushing new overarching frameworks that are unlikely
to be adopted. Plus, the prospect of probing oversight during conflicts
would bolster Congress' political influence over decisions to intervene
militarily to begin with.

Some will criticize this oversight agenda as too modest. And yet, it
stands a more realistic chance of addressing the problems and improving
the political checks laid out above than a dramatic legislative
revamping would. Others will criticize it as politically unworkable,
essentially asking for a different type of congressional membership,
with different political incentives and institutional commitments, than
the one that exists. That may be so. If that is the case, though, then
ambitions for a radical legislative overhaul --- especially one that
sticks --- do not stand a chance.

#### Biden's upcoming CAT policy solves.

KL\]

The [Biden]{.underline} administration [is expected to **soon
release**]{.underline} [its version of the US Conventional Arms
Transfer]{.underline} (**[CAT]{.underline}**) policy, [which sets the
guardrails for how America sells arms]{.underline} to foreign
militaries. While the administration has held its cards close on what
the new policy will entail, it is widely expected to put a renewed
emphasis on the human rights records of potential arms buyers.

This is not only because the President has been committed to promoting
human rights throughout his career, including by convening the
first-ever Summit for Democracy in December, but also so he can make
clear that his commitment to human rights differs from the Trump
administration's, which largely overlooked such concerns.

The question is, will the Biden CAT policy be revolutionary, or like
most presidents' arms sales policies, evolutionary?

Reflecting the concerns of the immediate post-Vietnam War period,
President Jimmy Carter followed through on a campaign promise by
publishing Presidential Directive/NSC-13 \[PDF\] and a "policy
statement" on conventional arms transfers -- the first from a US
president. Carter made clear his intent: "The United States can and
should take the first step" in order to reduce the supply of arms
globally. He drew a direct link to human rights, stating that US
security assistance programs "will promote and advance respect for human
rights in recipient countries."

Not surprisingly, President Ronald Reagan took a very different tact,
and his presidential directive on CAT allowed for significantly more
defense exports. Of the five CAT policies after Carter, this is the only
truly revolutionary one.

Reagan boldly refuted Carter's rhetoric, stating that the US "will deal
with the world as it is, rather than as we would like it to be" and
proclaimed that arms transfers would not be "discrete," but instead an
"essential" and "indispensable" part of the United States' effort to
strengthen its national security and defend the free world. Reagan's
revolutionary policy introduced the concept of a "case-by-case" review
of sales, giving the government the flexibility to ignore its own CAT
policy if it sees fit.

Just weeks after releasing this policy, Reagan approved the world's
then-largest arms sale, a \$8.5 billion package to Saudi Arabia that
included AWACS surveillance aircraft. The sale was controversial on the
Hill, with 44 senators --- including then-Senator Joseph Biden ---
cosponsoring a bill to block the sale.

Fourteen years later, after the end of the Cold War in 1995, President
Bill Clinton released the nation's next CAT policy, which in true
Clintonian fashion triangulated between the Carter and Reagan policies.

While his policy echoed elements of Carter's intent of restraint,
Clinton emphasized Reagan's case-by-case concept by including it in the
very first sentence of his criteria, and then reinforced the Republican
president's philosophy by stating that "transfers of conventional arms
\[are\] a legitimate instrument of US foreign policy," and reaffirmed
the link between the health of the defense industrial base and the
overall economy.

In practice, Clinton approved several significant arms sales, including
\$500 million in fighter aircraft to Chile. This reversal of Carter's
refusal to sell advanced weaponry to Latin America resulted in Senate
legislation to show liberal opposition to the shift. One of the
co-sponsors? Senator Joseph Biden.

President Obama's CAT policy was the first of the post 9/11 era, more
focused on defense exports as a tool to build partner capabilities to
fight terrorism, restating Reagan's mantra that arms transfers are a
"legitimate instrument" of national security policy.

While the Obama policy discusses human rights in more detail than
previous versions, stating a need for "restraint against the transfer of
arms that would... serve to facilitate human rights abuses...," it does
not state that the US should leverage defense export decisions to push
recipients to improve their human rights. The human rights community
would like to see Biden's policy clearly state that it will take such an
approach.

For all of the differences between Presidents Obama and Trump, and
despite the commentary that President Trump's CAT policy was radically
pro-industry, the text of his policy was in truth evolutionary,
continuing many elements of the Obama-era policy and actually copying
some language verbatim.

Where Trump differed from Obama significantly was in his implementation
of the policy, specifically with his White House's willingness to work
directly with defense companies, instead of directing them to State or
Defense. Senior White House staff also made the case to push defense
exports publicly, making them a key part of Trump's economic agenda. In
this COVID era, how closely Biden ties defense exports to job creation
and improving the manufacturing sector is an area to watch.

What Might Biden's CAT Policy Look Like?

A CAT policy centrally focused on human rights would be revolutionary,
recalling the views of the senator from Delaware who consistently pushed
back against presidents as they attempted to sell arms abroad in the
1980s and 1990s. However, there are several reasons to believe that
Biden will instead favor an evolutionary CAT policy.

First, Biden has made repairing frayed international partnerships and
countering China core foreign policy tenets. Increased defense
cooperation with partners, including arms sales, is one way to show the
US commitment to rebuilding these relationships.

Second, as part of his effort to repair a US economy ravaged by
COVID-19, the president has specifically targeted assistance to the
manufacturing sector. The aerospace and defense industry supports over
2.5 million domestic jobs \[PDF\], including highly skilled
manufacturing, creating a significant economic incentive for the White
House to enable this industry to grow.

Third, he served as Obama's vice president, and both National Security
Advisor Jake Sullivan and Secretary of State Tony Blinken served in
prominent roles during the Obama administration. They had a hand in
crafting and implementing Obama's CAT policy; it is unlikely their views
on arms sales have changed dramatically over the past four years.

Other changes we may see in Biden's CAT policy include an increased
focus on protecting US-origin military technology from Chinese
intellectual property theft, further developing the US position on
exporting surveillance technology (as discussed at the Summit for
Democracy), and more detail on how the government will consider the
export of cyber technologies to foreign militaries.

The rhetoric of Biden's CAT policy will likely make clear that the Trump
era of defense exports is over, and human rights will be a more
significant criteria. Indeed, sales went down 21% in fiscal year 2021,
which spanned the last three months of the Trump administration and the
first nine months of Biden's. But ultimately, the practical result of
the policy will come down to implementation, as Biden and his team
grapple with how to balance his commitment to human rights with a
rapidly evolving landscape of domestic and international challenges.

There is good reason for members to do so. Members of [Congress
can]{.underline}, individually and together, [wield **considerable**
informal influence over American military interventions]{.underline}.5
[Legislating war is not only politically difficult but can also be
rigid, where **policy influence**]{.underline} [leaves room for
**flexibility** and **negotiation**]{.underline}.6 Overemphasizing
formal authorization, sanctions, or appropriations measures can ignore
oversight of "military intervention and conflict \[that\] should be
continuous and focused more heavily on the conduct of campaigns long
after their initiation."7 The preparatory, preventive, and educational
work ahead of and during an intervention is an area of vital
Congressional concern, and here informal approaches sometimes work best.

History suggests that [presidents consider congressional opinion a
**great deal**]{.underline} [when making **use-of-force**
decisions]{.underline}, in part because [these views can serve as a
**proxy** for domestic will]{.underline}.8 [Executives are]{.underline}
**[especially sensitive]{.underline}** [to such signals]{.underline}
"[because **public defeats** threaten to weaken their
credibility]{.underline} on the world scene," [whereas **shared
expressions of resolve** may **intimidate adversaries**]{.underline}.9
George H. W. Bush, for instance, asked Capitol Hill for a last-minute
authorization before launching the Gulf War in 1991, hoping to avoid
"weakening his hand" in global opinion.10 Senators John McCain, Joseph
Lieberman, and Lindsey Graham helped set the political conditions in
which George W. Bush pursued the Iraqi "surge" strategy in 2007. Barack
[Obama]{.underline} ultimately [determined not to strike
Syria]{.underline} after its regime's chemical attack, [citing
**insufficient** congressional support]{.underline} for such a move.

By exercising its informal influence, [Congress can]{.underline} press
for initiating a worthy conflict [by changing **public narratives** and
**assumptions**]{.underline}, or it can [help to avoid an **unwise**
one]{.underline}. [Members of Congress]{.underline} can [test prewar
intelligence and political assessments and define likely **costs** and
**benefits**. They]{.underline} can [serve as a proxy for a broader
public debate and inject a discussion of various courses of action into
the body politic]{.underline}, well outside basement Pentagon conference
rooms. [Once a war is under way, Congress can]{.underline} question
existing military and political strategies and [test assessments about
how the fight is going]{.underline}. Members can form on-the-ground
perspectives, offer alternative approaches, and encourage allied
involvement. Perhaps most important, [they]{.underline} can [lobby for a
needed **change of course**]{.underline}, elevate the voice of
stakeholders set aside by the executive branch, [press for an **end** to
failing wars]{.underline}, or disincentive a dangerously precipitous
withdrawal where U.S. forces should stay. [All this can be done

Rethinking Congress' Role in Foreign Policy

Having established NATO's challenges, I turn next to examining Congress'
ability to address those challenges. This section seeks to develop an
understanding of how Congress can shape foreign policy at a time of high
polarization and low institutional capacity.

A quick scan of recent **[headlines]{.underline}** would [suggest bleak
prospects for congressional influence in foreign policy]{.underline}: a
hamstrung and polarized legislature lacking adequate expertise and
resources, unable to pass legislation or conduct oversight.42 Indeed,
Congress has struggled to fully exercise its most important foreign
policy powers -- the power of the purse, the power to authorize or
prohibit U.S. military action, and the power to hold the executive
branch accountable. However, my [research uncovered]{.underline} a
number of [**less formal** ways in which Congress can **shape foreign
policy**]{.underline} [despite the **institutional
obstacles**]{.underline}. I refer to these tactics as "Avenues of
Influence" to distinguish them from more formal congressional powers
such as budgeting, legislating, and oversight.

This section draws heavily on my interviews, as well as on academic and
policy literature. In particular, my thinking has been influenced by the
Center for a New American Security's "[Congress's Hidden Strengths:
Wielding Informal Tools of **National Security
Oversight**]{.underline}."43 In that report, Richard Fontaine and Loren
DeJonge Schulman note that while Congress has failed to pass legislation
authorizing the use of U.S. military force, lawmakers have other, less
formal tools at their disposal to influence debates about U.S. military
involvement abroad. I am grateful to the authors for their insights,
which I hope to refine and extend to other foreign policy issues such as
alliance management.

Calling out wrongdoing. First, [Congress is]{.underline} especially
**[well-suited]{.underline}** [to vocally and **forcefully
critiquing**]{.underline} [bad behavior by other actors at home or
abroad]{.underline}. [As the branch]{.underline} of government [that
represents the American **public**]{.underline}, [Congress]{.underline}
has long embraced a duty to investigate wrongdoing within the broader
constitutional system of checks and balances. 44 More generally, it
[derives **unique legitimacy**]{.underline} [from its role as the voice
of the **people** and the body that]{.underline} ultimately [determines
whether a policy can be backed by **funds**]{.underline}. 45 As Richard
Fontaine, a former foreign policy advisor to Sen. John McCain, put it,
"[They have institutional authority]{.underline} and power [that doesn't
exist anywhere else]{.underline} in government, from the power of the
purse to the confirmation process to other forms of power and
leverage."46

[Lawmakers]{.underline} have added incentives to [engage in]{.underline}
"**[callouts]{.underline}**" [because fighting **unethical** or
**unlawful** behavior plays well with **constituents**]{.underline} and
in the media. In addition, the sheer size of Congress creates a
messiness that lends itself to the calling-out function: It is much
easier to get a group of lawmakers with different interests to agree on
criticizing something than on, say, proposing a new initiative.

Checking the executive. [Congress' callouts]{.underline}
**[frequently]{.underline}** [take the form of holding the executive
branch **accountable**]{.underline}, a power with a well-established
constitutional and historical basis. [Congress exercises oversight of
the executive through **hearings**, **reporting requirements**, and
**investigations**]{.underline}.47 This is one of the traditional areas
of congressional involvement in foreign policy that has eroded in recent
years.48 Still, [Congress does retain **some ability** to exercise
oversight through traditional mechanisms as well as]{.underline} through
more [indirect channels, such as shaping the public and media narrative
and making its priorities known]{.underline} to the executive branch.49

#### Congress's foreign policy influence with [allies]{.underline} is still [significant]{.underline}.

[Congress retains **significant influence**]{.underline} [on foreign
policy **despite** today's constrained environment and the executive
branch's **general dominance** of this area]{.underline}. Notably, most
of these [avenues of influence can be pursued in a **highly partisan**
climate]{.underline}. [Initiatives like **spotlighting rights abuses**
abroad, critiquing the **executive branch**, and **interacting with
allies**]{.underline} often [have **bipartisan support**]{.underline},
while tactics like [private conversations with foreign
counterparts]{.underline} and statements to the media [do not require
reaching across the aisle **at all**]{.underline}.80

Perhaps most importantly, many of [the legislature's most important
channels]{.underline} of influence [are **informal** ones]{.underline},
largely separate from the formal, constitutional powers that today's
Congress often struggles to exercise. Indeed, [Congress wields influence
even when it **does not pass** legislation]{.underline}. As James
Lindsay wrote three decades ago:

> ...focusing on the legislative track record captures only part of the
> story. [Congress influences policy through **several indirect
> means**]{.underline}: [anticipated reactions, changes in the
> decision-making process in the executive branch, and political
> grandstanding]{.underline}. Indeed, the same factors that frustrate
> congressional attempts to lead on foreign affairs encourage
> legislators to use indirect means to influence policy.81

Today, these indirect means may be even more important. This section has
found that [Congress does have a role to play on
**day-to-day**]{.underline} [foreign policy issues]{.underline} like
alliance management, and that the legislative branch remains relevant
despite the institutional and political constraints that hamper its
governing capacity.

[The Pentagon was **already struggling** to keep up with Congress'

earmarked an extra \$40 billion for Ukraine.

Concerns are mounting on Capitol Hill about the Biden administration's
ability to properly account for the unprecedented wave of cash and to
track the thousands of U.S. weapons heading to Ukraine for its war with
Russia. And [given the Pentagon's recent **track record** concerning
congressional oversight, it's coming under **increased
scrutiny**]{.underline} [from members of **both parties**]{.underline}
--- [from]{.underline} progressive Elizabeth [**Warren** to]{.underline}
libertarian **[Rand Paul]{.underline}**.

Some lawmakers are already warning the Biden administration that [a
**future** aid package could **lose**]{.underline} the overwhelming
**[congressional support]{.underline}** [that has been a hallmark of the
previous efforts]{.underline}. A key barometer will be [the
Pentagon's]{.underline} handling and complete [accounting of the
funds]{.underline}, which [has **lagged**]{.underline} in other areas,
[**sparking scrutiny** from congressional committees]{.underline}.

Sen. Warren (D-Mass.), a member of the Armed Services Committee, said in
an email that a full accounting of the already-appropriated funding will
be "critically important for both past and future funding requests."

"The U.S. government is sending billions in humanitarian, economic, and
military assistance to help the Ukrainian people overcome Putin's brutal
war, and the American people expect strong oversight by Congress and
full accounting from the Department of Defense," she added.

Pentagon spokesperson Marine Corps Lt. Col. Anton Semelroth said the
department is "committed" to transparency with the public and with
Congress about the security assistance funds. But he stressed that war
involves risk, and called on Russia to end the conflict.

"Risk of diversion is one of many considerations that we routinely
assess when evaluating any potential arms transfer," Semelroth said. "In
this case, risk would be considerably minimized by the full withdrawal
from Ukraine by Russian forces."

While all Democrats and most Republicans voted for the aid package in
May, [it's **unclear**]{.underline} [whether that coalition can stick
together if]{.underline} President Joe [Biden asks Congress for more
money before the end of the fiscal year]{.underline}, as many on the
Hill predict will be the case. The Pentagon already owes Congress a
backlog of reports on its spending for European security, and
[progressives and conservatives]{.underline} alike have [said they'll be
looking]{.underline} for more cooperation [before approving another cash
infusion.]{.underline}

Amid the Pentagon-Hill squabbling, Biden announced on Wednesday the
first tranche of military assistance from the massive funding bill that
cleared both chambers last month. And oversight concerns are at the
forefront, as the newly announced \$700 million package for the first
time includes a more advanced, precision-guided rocket system that will
allow Ukraine to strike targets even further away --- potentially in
Russia.

The Biden administration deliberated for weeks over whether to send the
High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, known as HIMARS, and medium or
long-range munitions. Officials worried that providing longer-range
rockets could provoke Russian President Vladimir Putin into escalating
the conflict. They ultimately decided to send the shorter-range rockets,
which can reach 48 miles, instead of the longer-range munitions, which
can fly 190 miles.

Officials worry about the department's ability to keep track of all the
weapons the U.S. is providing, including the HIMARS, as well as ensuring
they are being used effectively. Kyiv has given Washington "assurances"
that it will only use the rockets on the battlefield in Ukraine, and not
to strike targets in Russia, senior administration officials said. But
they did not detail those assurances, and there is concern that the
Pentagon has no way to monitor the use of the weapons.

Semelroth said the department is "confident in the Ukrainian
government's ability to appropriately safeguard and account for
transferred U.S.-origin defense equipment," noting that Defense
Secretary Lloyd Austin has underscored the importance of
"accountability" to his Ukrainian counterpart, Oleksii Reznikov.

"Ukrainian leadership have assured us that they understand the
importance of accountability, and we are committed to working with them
to further enhance accountability in the future," Semelroth said.

A senior congressional official familiar with the oversight process
described it as "quite robust" and said the administration has been
briefing Hill committees regularly.

"In most cases, it's munitions going out of our stocks and into the
hands of Ukraine. One Howitzer out for us, one in for them," the
official said, granted anonymity to speak about sensitive briefings.

The \$40 billion legislation includes several measures aimed at beefing
up oversight of the cash. It requires the Pentagon inspector general's
office to review how the Defense Department spends the emergency
funding. It also requires the Pentagon, in coordination with the State
Department, to report to Congress on how weapons and equipment sent to
Ukraine are being accounted for.

Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.), a member of the Armed Services Committee,
acknowledged that U.S. weapons sent to war zones have often gone missing
or unused, but said "Ukraine is a different story" because its forces
are well-trained and have been using the weapons for several years
already.

"Obviously, we always have to be on the lookout, but this is not the
same scenario that we have in the past," Gallego said. "There have been
agreements between our governments about \[some of the weapons'\] usage.
And I believe so far Ukraine has abided by all of them."

The Biden administration is using several metrics to determine how best
to allocate the money, including the selection of systems that will help
beat back Russia, but not fuel a wider conflict. Another consideration
is not sending Ukrainians cutting-edge technology, given U.S. concerns
the weapons could fall into Russian hands. If that happened, the
Russians could reverse-engineer those systems and create new weapons for
its military, according to an official with knowledge of the discussions
who was not authorized to speak on the record.

"We in the administration have to very prudently measure those risks ...
and to think very carefully about how can we best ... give the Ukrainian
military what they need," Army Secretary Christine Wormuth told the
Atlantic Council on Tuesday.

The White House is hoping the latest emergency funding measure is enough
to sustain Ukraine through the next several months of the conflict, but
Congress is already bracing for the next cash fight.

At a confirmation hearing last week, Gen. Christopher Cavoli, Biden's
nominee to lead U.S. European Command, indicated that he believed that
Americans are owed "a thoughtful application of those funds and a full
accounting of them."

That's going to be a heavy lift for the Pentagon, which already owes the
Senate Armed Services Committee "several years" worth of reports,
according to Warren. That includes billions of dollars already allocated
for the European Deterrence Initiative, a program aimed at bolstering
U.S. presence on the continent following Russia's 2014 seizure of
Crimea. Warren said she was "getting sick of the run-around here" and
said the Pentagon "has not complied with the law."

In a recent letter to the Pentagon's finance chief obtained by POLITICO,
Warren wrote that "tracking this spending is a key part of how we
protect American interests and support of our allies."

Although every Democrat in both the Senate and House voted for the \$40
billion aid package last month, [several progressives were **reluctant**
to support it given their existing concerns about a **bloated
Pentagon**]{.underline}, as well as their general opposition to flooding
a war zone with new weapons. Congressional leaders significantly boosted
the humanitarian assistance portion, mollifying lawmakers who had
considered voting against the bill.

[Sen. Paul]{.underline} (R-Ky.), who [held up the]{.underline} \$40
billion aid [package amid his demands that Congress tap a special
inspector general to **monitor**]{.underline} [the spending]{.underline}
of the Ukraine funds, has raised similar concerns.

[A **fiscal hawk**]{.underline}, [Paul joined **10** other GOP senators
and **57** House Republicans in voting **against** the aid bill, with
several arguing that there wasn't stringent enough
**oversight**]{.underline} of the money. Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) argued
the money "comes \[with\] no meaningful oversight."

The latest round of emergency funding dwarfs an earlier \$14 billion
package enacted by Congress in March and supersizes several programs to
aid Ukraine's military, including \$6 billion for the Ukraine Security
Assistance Initiative, a Pentagon program that helps arm the Ukrainian
military. In a government-wide funding deal passed in March, by
contrast, lawmakers allocated \$300 million for the account.

The package also raises the total authority to ship weapons to Ukraine
from U.S. military inventories to \$11 billion. Additionally, the
Pentagon was granted nearly \$9 billion in new funding to replace
weapons that have been sent into the fight.

In short, what Biden regularly calls "the power of our example" is
nothing like what it used to be. When it comes to the pillars of a
law-abiding democracy, the United States is now more an example of what
to avoid than of what to embrace. The country retains military primacy
and the economic heft to impose sanctions, but the former has limited
utility, and the latter are seldom effective when wielded unilaterally.

#### DoD has strong tech oversight now 

**Serbu 3/14** \[Jared Serbu, DEPUTY EDITOR/DOD REPORTER; "Congress taps
brakes on DoD project to reform IT funding"; March 14, 2022 8:17 am;
DOA: 6/20/22;

Lowell-ES\]

Last week's passage of an omnibus spending bill eliminated the threat of
a full-year continuing resolution and gave the Defense budget a nearly
4.7% spending increase. But lawmakers were less generous when it came to
the matter of expanding a program meant to test major reforms to how DoD
funds technology modernization.

The final agreement rejected the Pentagon's request to significantly
expand what's known as the Software and Digital Technology Pilot Program
in 2022. The pilot, in short, lets major IT programs fund development
using a single "color of money," rather than trying to wedge their
budgets into the R&D, procurement and operations accounts that were
originally designed for major weapons systems.

Congress initially allowed DoD to test the concept with eight technology
programs as part of the 2021 appropriations bill. And [the department
will still be allowed to continue proving its case --- that a single
color of money doesn't diminish Congressional oversight]{.underline} ---
with those same programs. [But DoD had asked for permission to add five
new programs to the pilot this year.]{.underline}

The House Appropriations Committee had okayed nearly all of them in its
version of the 2022 budget. At the committee level, the sole exception
was also the department's boldest: The Navy had proposed to move all
2022 spending for its Next Generation Enterprise Network (NGEN)
contract, nearly \$1 billion, into the pilot.

But the Senate Appropriations Committee never passed its own version of
the bill, one possible explanation for why the final omnibus took a more
cautious approach to expanding the program.

Besides NGEN, [the Pentagon]{.underline} had also
[requested]{.underline} to move \$186 million in [funding for the Joint
Artificial Intelligence Center]{.underline} into the pilot, plus three
Air Force programs: Strategic Mission Planning and Execution System, Air
and Space Operations Center, and Defense Enterprise Accounting and
Management System.

Those programs' omission from the omnibus leaves the Air Force with no
participation in the colorless money pilot, though it does still include
the Space Force's Kobayashi Maru program, which was added last year.

Officials in DoD's technology and acquisition communities have long seen
the weapons-centric approach to funding as a barrier to the military's
adoption of modern concepts like continuous software delivery and
DevSecOps, since those approaches are almost antithetical to the idea
that a software project can be categorized as in the "research" or
"procurement" or "operations and maintenance" stages that correspond to
a hardware system's normal lifecycle.

"\[Software\] doesn't behave like a weapon system," Jane Rathbun, the
Department of the Navy's CTO said last year, while also acknowledging
that the size of the NGEN request caught lawmakers off guard. "I've
talked to a hundred people who spend six months with their lawyers
deciding whether or not they can use procurement or O&M funding for
things. I mean, that slows us down. It would be a cultural shift for the
entire Department of Defense, and really enable a DevSecOps culture."

Doug Bush, the newly-sworn in assistant secretary of the Army for
acquisition, logistics and technology, said much the same in a
roundtable with reporters last month.

"I don't believe the private sector distinguishes between R&D and
procurement for software. But we do. Does that make sense? I'm not so
sure," he said. "[But that's **going to have to be a discussion with
Congress** to **make sure they're comfortable** with how we're proposing
to use the authorities and whether or not we can think about how we
budget for software, which will be critically important.]{.underline}"

**Nikitin 22** \[Beth D. Nikitin, Specialist in Nonproliferation;
\"Biological Security Engagement in Ukraine: U.S. Cooperation and Threat
Reduction Programs\"; Congressional Research Service; Published:

https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IN/IN11886; KL\]

During its invasion of Ukraine, [the Russian government has accused
Ukraine of possessing a clandestine biological weapons program with
support from the United States]{.underline}. To the contrary, [the
United States has cooperated with Ukraine on biological
**security**]{.underline} programs ranging from laboratory security to
disease surveillance and pandemic response, [as documented
by]{.underline} the U.S. embassy website, annual budget requests, and
[congressional **oversight** hearings]{.underline}. These programs are
rooted in the U.S. Cooperative Threat Reduction Program (CTR). The
United States and Ukraine are both members of the Biological Weapons
Convention (BWC), which prohibits such weapons, and the United States
has stated that both are in full compliance with their obligations. The
State Department assesses that the Russian government \"maintains an
offensive biological weapons program\" in violation of the BWC.

Congress has raised questions about this issue in recent hearings. U.S.
Director of National Intelligence (DNI) Avril Haines testified on March
10 that \"we do not assess that Ukraine is pursuing either biological
weapons or nuclear weapons.\" State Department Spokesman Ned Price said
on March 9, \"Russia is inventing false pretexts in an attempt to
justify its own horrific actions in Ukraine.\" The allegation has led to
concern that Russia may be planning a \"false flag\" operation in which
it plants evidence or uses a biological weapon against Ukraine but
blames another party.

In addition, combat operations may put sensitive biological laboratories
at risk. A Department of Defense (DOD) press release says, \"There are
five biological research laboratories in Kyiv. Their work focuses on
diagnostics, therapeutics, treatments, prevention and vaccines, not on
military use as the Russians and Chinese accuse.\" U.S. officials and
outside experts have expressed concerns that Ukraine\'s laboratories
holding pathogen collections may come under attack or Russian military
control. The World Health Organization reportedly urged Ukrainian
authorities to destroy research samples of disease pathogens to avoid
accidental release should the facilities be damaged in the war. An
emergency meeting of the UN Security Council, requested by Russia,
discussed the issue on March 11. The United Nations High Representative
for Disarmament Affairs Izumi Nakamitsu said that \"certain public
health facilities are in areas impacted by armed conflict putting the
safety of those facilities at risk,\" and that the United Nations is
\"not aware\" of any biological weapons program in Ukraine. U.S.
Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield told the
Council: \"Ukraine does not have a biological weapons program, and there
are no Ukrainian biological weapons laboratories supported by the United
States.\" She also said, \"Ukraine owns and operates its own public
health laboratory infrastructure. These facilities make it possible to
detect and diagnose diseases like COVID-19, which benefit us all. The
United States has assisted Ukraine to do this safely and securely.\"

In the past, the Russian and Chinese governments have repeatedly alleged
that U.S. ongoing biological security cooperation programs in Ukraine,
Georgia, and Kazakhstan were military in nature. Several U.S. federal
agencies, such as the State Department and the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC), cooperate with Ukraine to meet
international biosafety and global health security standards. The
Department of Defense Cooperation Threat Reduction (CTR) program also
works with partner countries to destroy or secure high-priority
biological pathogens (\"Select Agents\") at their source and to develop
the partner\'s capacity to detect, diagnose, and report a disease
outbreak. The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) strongly denies any
weapons-related aspects. Congress oversees implementation of these
programs.

CTR\'s biological engagement began as a program focused on dismantling
the vast biological weapons complex inherited from the Soviet Union.
Ukraine and other non-Russian states of the former Soviet Union have
been willing partners in dismantling the Soviet biological weapons
legacy and securing pathogen collections and laboratories. Facilities in
these countries were abandoned by the Russian military when the
republics became independent states, and in many cases local governments
were not aware of their existence or the dangers they housed. Over time,
the United States learned of dangerous pathogen collections dispersed
throughout the region. A decade after the dissolution of the Soviet
Union, these facilities lacked security and safety measures, had lost
expert staff due to economic conditions, and many were in a state of
disrepair. The United States, accordingly, accelerated its assistance to
these facilities starting in the late 1990s.

Congress first added funds to the DOD\'s CTR budget for biological
threat reduction (BTR) in the late 1990s. The DOD CTR FY2022 Budget
Estimate says the BTR \"program seeks to facilitate detection and
reporting of diseases caused by especially dangerous pathogens (EDPs),
including zoonotic diseases, which could affect the armed forces of the
United States or its allies and partners.\" DOD assistance has focused
on improving biosafety and security (BS&S) at laboratories housing
pathogen collections, including equipment upgrades and training, as well
as disease detection, diagnosis, and reporting enhancements (BSV). The
BTR program has built secure Central Reference Laboratories (CRL) for
pathogen collections in Azerbaijan, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan, and
completed upgrades at 39 \"Secured Labs\" in Armenia, Georgia,
Kazakhstan, and Ukraine. In addition, the program has provided Ukraine
with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) technical and material
assistance, including biosafety equipment, diagnostic supplies, and
subject matter expertise.

In light of Russia\'s apparent persistent dissemination of
disinformation regarding biological security cooperation with Ukraine,
Congress may examine how the federal government is countering these
claims, to include examining how effective the U.S. government has been
in presenting information of its own. [Congress may]{.underline} also
**[conduct oversight]{.underline}** [regarding the **safety** and
**security** of pathogen collections and biological research
laboratories during the ongoing Russian **invasion of
Ukraine**]{.underline}. [Additional]{.underline} potential [oversight
topics include whether personnel at those facilities are able to
**maintain operations**]{.underline} and how to leverage CTR funds in
the context of security assistance to Ukraine.

--- and will need to have learned from Obama-era missteps --- in order
to navigate through the tricky civil-military waters we have described

we hope that leads them to caution and humility rather than unwariness
and hubris as they conduct national security policy. If Lloyd Austin

When U.S. President Donald Trump left office on January 20, many of
those concerned about [the state of civil-military
relations]{.underline} in the United States breathed a deep sigh of
relief. They shouldn't have. Yes, Trump used the military as a political
prop, referred to some of its leaders as "my generals," and faced a
Pentagon that slow-rolled his attempts to withdraw troops from
battlefields around the world. But [problems]{.underline} in the
relationship between military officers and elected officials [did not
begin with Trump, and]{.underline} they [did not end when]{.underline}
Joe [Biden took office]{.underline}.

[Civilian control over the military is]{.underline} deeply [embedded in
the]{.underline} U.S. [Constitution]{.underline}; [the armed forces
answer to the]{.underline} president and **[legislature]{.underline}**.
Starting in 1947, Congress built robust institutions designed to
maintain this relationship. [But]{.underline} over the past three
decades, [civilian control has]{.underline} quietly but steadily
**[degraded]{.underline}**. Senior [military officers]{.underline} may
still follow orders and avoid overt insubordination, but their
[influence has grown, while **oversight** and
accountability]{.underline} mechanisms [have faltered]{.underline}.
Today, [presidents worry about military **opposition**]{.underline} to
[the]{.underline}ir policies and must reckon with an
[institution]{.underline} that [selectively implements executive
guidance]{.underline}. Too often, unelected military leaders limit or
engineer civilians' options so that generals can run wars as they see
fit.

Civilian control is therefore about more than whether military leaders
openly defy orders or want to overthrow the government. It's about the
extent to which political leaders can realize the goals the American
people elected them to accomplish. Here, [civilian control is not
binary; it is measured in **degrees**]{.underline}. Because the military
filters information that civilians need and implements the orders that
civilians give, it can wield great influence over civilian
decision-making. Even if elected officials still get the final say, they
may have little practical control if [generals dictate]{.underline} all
the [options or slow]{.underline} their
[implementation]{.underline}---as they often do now.

[Resetting this **broken relationship**]{.underline} is a tall order. It
[demands]{.underline} that [Congress]{.underline} doggedly
[pursue]{.underline} its [oversight]{.underline} role and hold the
military accountable, regardless of who occupies the White House. It
requires that defense secretaries hire skilled civilian staffs composed
of political appointees and civil servants. But most important, it
requires an attentive public that is willing to hold both civilian
leaders and the military to account.

[The Pentagon was **already struggling** to keep up with Congress'
demands for oversight of its spending]{.underline}. Then, lawmakers
earmarked an extra \$40 billion for Ukraine.

Concerns are mounting on Capitol Hill about the Biden administration's
ability to properly account for the unprecedented wave of cash and to
track the thousands of U.S. weapons heading to Ukraine for its war with
Russia. And [given the Pentagon's recent **track record** concerning
congressional oversight, it's coming under **increased
scrutiny**]{.underline} from members of both parties --- from
progressive Elizabeth Warren to libertarian Rand Paul.

Some lawmakers are already warning the Biden administration that [a
future aid package could **lose**]{.underline} the overwhelming
**[congressional support]{.underline}** that has been a hallmark of the
previous efforts. [A **key barometer**]{.underline} [will be the
Pentagon's **handling**]{.underline} [and **complete
accounting**]{.underline} [of the funds]{.underline}, which has lagged
in other areas, [**sparking scrutiny** from congressional
committees]{.underline}.

Sen. Warren (D-Mass.), a member of the Armed Services Committee, said in
an email that [a full accounting of]{.underline} the
already-appropriated [funding will be]{.underline} "**[critically
important]{.underline}** [for both past and future funding
requests]{.underline}."

"The U.S. government is sending billions in humanitarian, economic, and
military assistance to help the Ukrainian people overcome Putin's brutal
war, and the American people expect strong oversight by Congress and
full accounting from the Department of Defense," she added.

Pentagon spokesperson Marine Corps Lt. Col. Anton Semelroth said the
department is "committed" to transparency with the public and with
Congress about the security assistance funds. But he stressed that war
involves risk, and called on Russia to end the conflict.

"**[Risk of diversion]{.underline}** [is one of many considerations that
we **routinely assess**]{.underline} when evaluating any potential arms
transfer," Semelroth said. "In this case, risk would be considerably
minimized by the full withdrawal from Ukraine by Russian forces."

While all Democrats and most Republicans voted for the aid package in
May, [it's **unclear** whether that coalition can **stick
together**]{.underline} [if]{.underline} President Joe [Biden asks
Congress for]{.underline} **[more money]{.underline}** before the end of
the fiscal year, as many on the Hill predict will be the case. [The
Pentagon already owes Congress a **backlog** of reports on its spending
for **European security**]{.underline}, and progressives and
conservatives alike have said they'll be looking for more cooperation
before approving another cash infusion.

Amid the Pentagon-Hill squabbling, Biden announced on Wednesday the
first tranche of military assistance from the massive funding bill that
cleared both chambers last month. And oversight concerns are at the
forefront, as the newly announced \$700 million package for the first
time includes a more advanced, precision-guided rocket system that will
allow Ukraine to strike targets even further away --- potentially in
Russia.

The Biden administration deliberated for weeks over whether to send the
High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, known as HIMARS, and medium or
long-range munitions. Officials worried that providing longer-range
rockets could provoke Russian President Vladimir Putin into escalating
the conflict. They ultimately decided to send the shorter-range rockets,
which can reach 48 miles, instead of the longer-range munitions, which
can fly 190 miles.

Officials worry about the department's ability to keep track of all the
weapons the U.S. is providing, including the HIMARS, as well as ensuring
they are being used effectively. [Kyiv has given Washington
"**assurances**]{.underline}" that it will only use the rockets on the
battlefield in Ukraine, and not to strike targets in Russia, senior
administration officials said. But they did not detail those assurances,
and there is concern that the Pentagon has no way to monitor the use of
the weapons.

Semelroth said [the department is]{.underline} "[**confident** in the
Ukrainian government's ability to **appropriately
safeguard**]{.underline} [and **account**]{.underline} [for transferred
U.S.-origin defense equipment]{.underline}," noting that Defense
Secretary Lloyd Austin has underscored the importance of
"accountability" to his Ukrainian counterpart, Oleksii Reznikov.

"Ukrainian leadership have assured us that they understand the
importance of accountability, and we are committed to working with them
to further enhance accountability in the future," Semelroth said.

[A senior congressional official familiar with the oversight process
described it as]{.underline} "**[quite robust]{.underline}**" and said
the administration has been briefing Hill committees regularly.

"In most cases, it's munitions going out of our stocks and into the
hands of Ukraine. One Howitzer out for us, one in for them," the
official said, granted anonymity to speak about sensitive briefings.

The \$40 billion legislation includes several measures aimed at beefing
up oversight of the cash. It requires the Pentagon inspector general's
office to review how the Defense Department spends the emergency
funding. It also requires the Pentagon, in coordination with the State
Department, to report to Congress on how weapons and equipment sent to
Ukraine are being accounted for.

Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.), a member of the Armed Services Committee,
acknowledged that U.S. weapons sent to war zones have often gone missing
or unused, but said "Ukraine is a different story" because its forces
are well-trained and have been using the weapons for several years
already.

"Obviously, we always have to be on the lookout, but this is not the
same scenario that we have in the past," Gallego said. "There have been
agreements between our governments about \[some of the weapons'\] usage.
And I believe so far Ukraine has abided by all of them."

The Biden administration is using several metrics to determine how best
to allocate the money, including the selection of systems that will help
beat back Russia, but not fuel a wider conflict. Another consideration
is not sending Ukrainians cutting-edge technology, given U.S. concerns
the weapons could fall into Russian hands. If that happened, the
Russians could reverse-engineer those systems and create new weapons for
its military, according to an official with knowledge of the discussions
who was not authorized to speak on the record.

"We in the administration have to very prudently measure those risks ...
and to think very carefully about how can we best ... give the Ukrainian
military what they need," Army Secretary Christine Wormuth told the
Atlantic Council on Tuesday.

The White House is hoping the latest emergency funding measure is enough
to sustain Ukraine through the next several months of the conflict, but
Congress is already bracing for the next cash fight.

At a confirmation hearing last week, Gen. Christopher Cavoli, Biden's
nominee to lead U.S. European Command, indicated that he believed that
Americans are owed "a thoughtful application of those funds and a full
accounting of them."

That's going to be a heavy lift for the Pentagon, which already owes the
Senate Armed Services Committee "several years" worth of reports,
according to Warren. That includes billions of dollars already allocated
for the European Deterrence Initiative, a program aimed at bolstering
U.S. presence on the continent following Russia's 2014 seizure of
Crimea. Warren said she was "getting sick of the run-around here" and
said the Pentagon "has not complied with the law."

In a recent letter to the Pentagon's finance chief obtained by POLITICO,
Warren wrote that "tracking this spending is a key part of how we
protect American interests and support of our allies."

[Although **every Democrat** in both the Senate and House voted for the
\$40 billion aid package last month, **several progressives** were
reluctant to support it given their existing concerns about a **bloated
Pentagon**]{.underline}, as well as their general opposition to flooding
a war zone with new weapons. Congressional leaders significantly boosted
the humanitarian assistance portion, mollifying lawmakers who had
considered voting against the bill.

Sen. Paul (R-Ky.), who held up the \$40 billion aid package amid his
demands that Congress tap a special inspector general to monitor the
spending of the Ukraine funds, has raised similar concerns.

A fiscal hawk, Paul joined 10 other GOP senators and 57 House
Republicans in voting against the aid bill, with several arguing that
there wasn't stringent enough oversight of the money. Sen. Josh Hawley
(R-Mo.) argued the money "comes \[with\] no meaningful oversight."

The latest round of emergency funding dwarfs an earlier \$14 billion
package enacted by Congress in March and supersizes several programs to
aid Ukraine's military, including \$6 billion for the Ukraine Security
Assistance Initiative, a Pentagon program that helps arm the Ukrainian
military. In a government-wide funding deal passed in March, by
contrast, lawmakers allocated \$300 million for the account.

The package also raises the total authority to ship weapons to Ukraine
from U.S. military inventories to \$11 billion. Additionally, the
Pentagon was granted nearly \$9 billion in new funding to replace
weapons that have been sent into the fight.

In 1955 a book titled The Politics of the Prussian Army, 1640--1945 was
published; it would soon become [a landmark study of]{.underline}
[**c**ivil-**m**ilitary **r**elations]{.underline}.1 Gordon Craig's
unassuming tome became widely influential within and outside the
civil-military relations field and spurred the publication of what has
become a wide literature on the politics of armies (particularly those
of the United Kingdom, Italy, Russia, and France) that takes a different
approach to our conventional understanding of civil-military relations.2
What makes these latter books prescient in their instruction is that
they [disabuse readers of the **erroneous assumption**]{.underline}
[that armies are somehow **subservient** to their political masters and
**eschew involvement** in domestic **politics** or in any system of
**governance**]{.underline}. As the historical record demonstrates (and,
dare one suggest, a reflection of the U.S. Armed Forces in a
contemporary setting3), armies are all but inherently political and need
to be recognized as such if their effect on civil-military relations is
to be properly assessed.

[The **intrinsically political**]{.underline} [nature of military
organizations is no less true when it comes to armies' efforts in the
**education**, **training**, and **equipping** of foreign partner
nations' armed forces, known as]{.underline} security cooperation
(**[SC]{.underline}**) and security assistance (SA). [Yet]{.underline}
much of [the American bureaucracy and legal framework for these
activities treat them as fundamentally **technical
problems**]{.underline} that are susceptible to improvement through
better procedures. This technicism, to purloin a term from Samuel
Huntington,4 is arguably at the heart of many of our failures and
disappointments in building partner security forces (for example, those
of Afghanistan,5 Iraq,6 and Mali7) or in reforming defense institutions
in Central and Eastern Europe.8 Virtually every fix proposed to partners
is yet another technical or bureaucratic adjustment rather than an
acknowledgment of the fundamentally political nature of these
activities, both within a partner nation as well as among U.S. agencies
responsible for planning and carrying out the assistance programs.

The objective of this article is to argue that administration officials
and Congress face two different political challenges related to
improving SC and SA. Unless and until U.S. officials formulate solutions
to these political problems, both branches of government will struggle
to achieve more effective means of reforming partner nations' key
governmental institutions. First---and perhaps the easiest challenge to
address---is that SC and SA have unintended political consequences in
the government institutions of recipient countries and are not solely
technical tasks. No one has expressed this point better than Mara
Karlin, albeit she was speaking in reference to weak states:

Past experience offers two key lessons for U.S. officials as they seek
to strengthen the security sectors of weak states. First, like all
state-building endeavors, these are political, not technical, exercises.
Instead of focusing narrowly on training and equipment, U.S.
policymakers responsible for implementing such programs must address the
purpose and scope of the U.S. role and the mission, leadership, and
organizational structure of the partner's military.9

Second, [SC and SA are **highly politicized**]{.underline}; both are
**[inefficient]{.underline}**, [because of the **lack of
coordination**]{.underline} between the Department of Defense (DOD) and
Department of State, [and **ineffective**]{.underline}, [because of
**lack of alignment**]{.underline} [with **national security
goals**]{.underline} ([and]{.underline}/or [**foreign policy**
objectives]{.underline}). [This important reality needs **wider
appreciation**]{.underline} by these departments, as well as
[by]{.underline} **[Congress]{.underline}**, [if the U.S. Government is
to improve]{.underline} its ability to find value for money by improving
[partner nations' **ability**]{.underline} to defend their sovereignty,
[let alone contribute to **expeditionary operations**]{.underline}.
Recent reforms initiated by Congress, most notably in the fiscal year
(FY) 2017 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), constitute a good
first effort at addressing these longstanding problems; however, a
review of the evidence shows that this legislation should be augmented
to define the problem as largely political in nature, as opposed to
accepting the traditional default assumption that it is solely
technical, which would have enabled it to call for even deeper reforms
within these bureaucracies.

This article argues that, due to internal DOD politics and the
interorganizational politics within the U.S. Government, suboptimal
results ensue from the way the United States plans and executes SC and
SA. It then suggests legislative and policy changes that might better
take this reality into account. [The **stakes are high**]{.underline}.
If U.S. strategy is [to bring troops]{.underline} home
[from]{.underline} the so-called **[endless wars]{.underline}** overseas
and let others do the fighting, then [its success must be a **core
priority**]{.underline}. But only by reforming the way the United States
organizes itself to build allies' and partners' armed forces are we
likely to meet with any greater success than we have in the past.

Dramatis Personae

Many organizations throughout DOD have long conducted SC and SA. Key
roles are played by the military departments (MILDEPs) in execution of
these activities, which are in turn managed and coordinated by the
combatant commands and the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA).
Arguably, a deeper understanding of the inherent political nature of SC
and SA is necessary to ensure that these programs are planned, managed,
and executed in a more effective and efficient manner. Ensuring that
these activities actually "build" sustainable defense capacity must be a
high priority, [given **recent congressional dissatisfaction** with
**DOD failures**]{.underline} [to create institutions capable
of]{.underline} managing, controlling, and [sustaining]{.underline}
their [armed forces]{.underline}.

In terms of SC and SA, the proverbial elephant in the room is DOD. But
this has not always been the case. This is one of the externalities of
the George W. Bush administration's response to the global war on
terror; at the time, [DOD found]{.underline} that existing U.S. training
and particularly equipping programs funded by the Department of State's
appropriations and authorizations (Title 22, U.S. Code) simply were
insufficiently responsive and nimble to meet operational commanders'
requirements. [Congress responded to DOD's entreaties for **more
authority**]{.underline} to build partner forces in the FY 2006 NDAA,
which authorized DOD (with the concurrence of the Secretary of State) to
use its authorizations and appropriations (Title 10, U.S. Code) to build
capabilities and capacity in partner armed forces in order to conduct
counterterrorism operations. [The]{.underline} perhaps [predictable, if
not **inevitable**, result of DOD]{.underline} rapidly
[trying]{.underline} [to create capacity within partner armed forces was
an **embarrassing lack of attention**]{.underline} [paid to the
financial **niceties** and **details** that are of **great importance**
to Congress]{.underline}. As a RAND report observed, "[DOD lacks the
detailed financial data necessary to respond to]{.underline} new
[congressional reporting requirements]{.underline}. Moreover, [DOD
leaders are **unable to compare** SC spending across countries, regions,
and programs, which is critical to **future prioritization** and
**resourcing decisions**]{.underline}."10

[Perhaps it is inaccurate to characterize DOD as an
elephant]{.underline} (in any room); [in reality, it is more like a herd
of **independently minded creatures**]{.underline}. [Title 10 makes it
clear that the **individual MILDEPs** exist in splendid political if not
**geographical isolation** from each other]{.underline}, let alone from
the Office of the Secretary of Defense. The MILDEPs' Major Force
Programs reflect the clear objective of Congress that the former retain
a high degree of autonomy from the Office of the Secretary of Defense,
notwithstanding largely ignored verbiage in the law that explicitly
states in the preamble to the three departments' sections that the
exercise of their functions are "subject to the authority, direction,
and control of the Secretary of Defense."11 The record demonstrates that
the intent of Congress's annual appropriations and authorizations easily
trumps this provision of the law. The canonical source of the MILDEPs'
autonomy is found in the 12 roles and missions assigned to them in Title
10.12 It is the particular authority of training under which the
MILDEPs' authority to conduct SC and SA reside (for example, continental
U.S.-based professional military education and all forms of training).

Other key players in the planning and execution of these programs
include the Office of the Secretary of Defense, which provides policy
guidance and priorities; DSCA, with its newly enhanced powers granted to
it via the FY 2017 NDAA (discussed below); the combatant commands, which
act as planners and coordinators of these activities (under the
authority of the Unified Command Plan); the Service components that
execute many of the in-country training events; and finally, as
extensions of the combatant commands, defense cooperation offices
resident in-country that manage and direct both training programs and
equipment transfers. [Given the number of **stakeholders**, the
**politics** of agreeing priorities, approaches, timing, scope, and so
forth, the execution of SC]{.underline} and SA activities [can be
**frightfully untidy**]{.underline}.

Since 2006, the previous position of the Department of State, which
originally had the lead in funding (and therefore some influence in
controlling) these activities, has been eclipsed. While it continues to
control funding for its many Title 22 programs, they are largely
executed via DSCA and the MILDEPs. Although Congress has recognized that
it has, in effect, created the basis for confusion via the two
departments' dual congressionally mandated authorities and
authorizations, a political decision to create a clear lead agent for
these activities remains missing. One will return to the U.S.
Government's well-used practice of "fudging" when it comes to
identifying who's in charge.

It is instructive at this point to cite the example of the FY 2016 NDAA,
which mandated that the "Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the
Secretary of State, shall develop and issue to the Department of Defense
a strategic framework for Department of Defense security cooperation to
guide prioritization of resources and activities."13 Absent from this
legislative language is any reference to "who decides," consultation
being a rather misleading turn of phrase because it implies a
relationship of equals (that is, inter pares), as opposed to any
suggestion of a hierarchy of authority---not even primus inter pares in
this case. In effect, successive legislation since 2006 has changed
radically the entire pre-2001 political calculus of how U.S.
defense-related advice and assistance are planned and executed. To
appreciate the magnitude of this shift, congressional testimony in 2017
acknowledged that DOD's Title 10 programs had tripled since 2001. For
comparison, prior to 2001, the Department of State managed approximately
80 percent of the U.S. Government's security assistance, whereas by
2017, this figure had dropped to about 50 percent.14 Thus, [Congress
continues its preference for DOD over the State Department in matters
related]{.underline} even [to the latter's **core
responsibility**]{.underline}---[that is, **diplomacy**]{.underline}. It
is little wonder, then, that such [moves]{.underline} have [opened the
U.S. Government to criticism that it has **militarized its foreign
policy**]{.underline}.15

The MILDEPs, in various forms and different organizations, largely carry
out SC via two different business models: either designing projects from
inception to meet specific requirements or training foreign personnel in
existing professional military education and training centers funded on
an incremental cost basis. In some cases, [the]{.underline} invoiced
costs of personnel might not even be grounded on such a financially
disciplined basis, thereby implying an unintended subsidy by
[DOD]{.underline}.16 Two aspects of training of foreign personnel by the
MILDEPs and defense entities often go unreported. First, data analysis
highlights an unpleasant externality: Training partner military
personnel doubles the likelihood of a military-led coup d'état.17
Evidently, the recent cases of Field Marshal Abdel Fattah al-Sisi of
Egypt and Captain Amadou Sanogo of Mali are far from rare.18 That said,
it must be clarified that correlation [does not]{.underline} imply
causation---but admittedly, these troubling data do raise questions.
Second, both DOD and the State Department reported in a 2011 Government
Accountability Office audit that neither [collects data on
SC]{.underline} and SA programs to evaluate their effectiveness.19 It is
disappointing that reliance on these programs of spreading Western
democratic defense governance concepts is undermined by the damning
admission that neither SC nor SA is designed to change behavior.20 This
fact is disconcerting but, sadly, not surprising. Marybeth Peterson
Ulrich all but excoriates the DOD disconnect between policy intent and
program performance regarding U.S. assistance that she saw provided to
the Czech Republic in the 1990s during a critical phase in its
democratization. By her analysis, some 80 percent of defense and
military contacts did not contribute to U.S. policy objectives intended
to further the democratization of Czech armed forces.21

[That there has been an apparent]{.underline}
**[disconnect]{.underline}** [between **congressional expectations**
that SC]{.underline} and SA [encourage the adoption of democratic norms
abroad is **hardly subtle**]{.underline} [and suggests a **political
causation**]{.underline} for these inconsistencies. After all, [if there
is **no government requirement** to produce **concrete results**, no one
can ever be **held accountable** for failure to meet **congressional
intent**]{.underline}. This inherent weakness to the U.S. Government's
approach to assisting its partners is no more glaringly obvious than in
its experience in Afghanistan. For instance, who bears ultimate
responsibility for the failure of DOD to re-create the Afghan air force:
the originating policymaker, Headquarters Air Force, North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO) Training Mission--Afghanistan, or U.S. Air
Force Central Command?22 A recent (and quite damning) Special Inspector
General for Afghanistan Reconstruction's lessons-learned report on that
lack of progress in the country was unsubtly titled Divided
Responsibility.23

The Politics of Causation

In defense of her fetching appearance, the sultry character Jessica
Rabbit in the 1988 film Who Framed Roger Rabbit? claimed, "I'm not bad;
I'm just drawn that way." This cri de coeur has resonance in that all of
these [SC]{.underline} and SA [programs]{.underline}, the officials
overseeing them, and the many individuals who make up the workforce are
not "bad." Rather, they [are simply operating within the **intent** and
spirit of their specific congressional appropriations and
authorizations]{.underline}. That a RAND report could find in 2016 some
140 core and supporting authorities that applied to DOD security
cooperation paints a rather dissolute tableau prior to the passage of
the FY 2017 NDAA, which consolidated these authorities.24
[But]{.underline} just as political considerations impeded reforms prior
to 2016, subsequent congressional intent apparently has strong political
support to redraw DOD's version of its own Jessica Rabbit, and
critically, where politics allow, including the Department of State's
security assistance programs.

Congress's intent to address these shortcomings was made clear in the FY
2017 NDAA, which contained language that has significantly rationalized
authorities to make conducting SC less complex in the following:25

- [Policy **oversight** and resource allocation have been
  **centralized** in the]{.underline} Office of the [Secretary of
  Defense]{.underline}, while unifying administration and execution of
  Title 10 SC programs within the Defense Security Cooperation Agency.

- DOD must now provide Congress with a consolidated budget justification
  for Title 10 activities.

- DOD must also develop an assessment, monitoring, and evaluation (AM&E)
  framework to create a disciplined and objective method of assessing
  program effectiveness.

- DOD is required to create an SC workforce development program26 to
  ensure personnel engaged in these activities have the required levels
  of education and training to execute these activities (this is to be
  fulfilled, in part, by the creation of a Security Cooperation
  University27).

This legislative intent to reform how DOD plans, manages, and executes
SC and SA could be interpreted as largely technical and seemingly
apolitical. Other than a forlorn plea in key DOD policy statements for
"greater coordination" among stakeholders, these new policies that
govern security cooperation28 and related Defense Institution Building29
activities of the DOD do not acknowledge, let alone address, the
inherent political nature of these activities---save a long-overdue
recognition for the need to assess a partner nation's political appetite
to accept assistance.30 Fortunately, this legislation has opened paths
to finding solutions to these vexatious conundrums, but there are some
other options that should also be considered.

[Congress's call for a disciplined ability to measure whether SC
programs are **actually effective**]{.underline}, in the form of the
adoption of an AM&E methodology, is a positive development, but there
are some policy nuances that **[must be addressed]{.underline}**. The
call for an AM&E methodology should end the previous DOD approach of
largely relying on anecdotal evidence (at best) to justify these
activities. A common Defense Department--wide method must be created
that will enable Congress to determine which programs and approaches are
effective and which are not.31

Even though [action is being taken to **improve**
**c**ivilian-**m**ilitary **r**elations]{.underline} and to limit
humanitarian worker kidnapping, it should not be forgotten that
Reveron's [vision of]{.underline} **[warrior-diplomats]{.underline}**
and development workers [**exceeds** the military's **capabilities** and
**core skill set**]{.underline}. As Secretary Gates stated, [the
militarization of U.S. foreign policy and civilian activities is **not
the solution**]{.underline} [to underfunded civilian
agencies]{.underline}. [Allowing the expansion of the U.S. military into
civilian sectors will not only]{.underline} continue the understaffing
of civilian agencies and [complicate the mission of the military, but it
will also contribute to]{.underline} a variety of [**obstacles**,
including]{.underline} **[insecurity]{.underline}**, within the
development community.

While the U.S. military provides much-needed technical and operational
assistance to other nations during military training, humanitarian
disasters, and transnational operations, [the **effectiveness** of DOD
as a development and diplomatic actor remains very much **in
question**]{.underline}. Even after years of programs in Iraq and
Afghanistan, [DOD **does not**]{.underline} appear to [have a
methodology for measuring the effectiveness of its]{.underline}
development, humanitarian, and [diplomatic activities]{.underline}. Best
practices and [sensibilities]{.underline} of the 21st century [require
that development organizations assess the **community's
needs**]{.underline} for the type and placement of buildings and for
goods and services, including education and skill development, [prior to
taking any action. The **military lens** is necessarily
different]{.underline} and often cannot be the same as the lens through
which U.S. civilian aid workers and the NGO community view their tasks.
The unfortunate result can be unusable buildings that feed the very
"hard" feelings the military's diligent work was intended to transform.
The civilian diplomat is similarly shaped by a different skill set and
broader orientation to diplomatic relations between states or with
nonstate actors. Reveron's argument for changing the nature of military
and security in the world is well founded and unavoidable, but [the
expansion of the military into]{.underline} development and broader
[diplomatic fields requires **skills** and **flexibility**]{.underline}
[the military does not have, nor are they skills it should
develop]{.underline}. [**Civilian** agencies should lead **development
operations**]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} Reveron's warrior-diplomats
should adopt the more focused roles of ensuring better [**s**ecurity
**c**ooperation]{.underline}, training peacekeepers, and building armed
forces in the developing world that respect rule of law and human
rights. As the U.S. military evolves and adapts to the lessons of Iraq
and Afghanistan, [it must cooperate with and]{.underline} help

1\. [The Rise of **Modern Warfare** and Its **Oversight
Challenges**]{.underline}

These oversight challenges became particularly apparent in the wake of
the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The 9/11 Commission, which was created to
investigate the incident and recommend ways to prevent future attacks,
stressed that [executive branch reforms]{.underline} "**[will not
work]{.underline}** [if congressional oversight does not
change]{.underline} too. [**Unity** of effort in executive management
can be **lost** if it is fractured by **divided congressional
oversight**]{.underline}."108 Calling oversight "dysfunctional," the
Commission recommended either creating a joint intelligence committee or
giving the existing intelligence committees both authorizing and
appropriating authorities.109 In short, the Commission concluded, the
outdated committee structure required reform to address contemporary
cross-cutting national security challenges.

Despite these warnings, the problems the Commission identified only
worsened in the years after 9/11. In particular, the convergence of
Title 10 and Title 50 operations accelerated considerably. [The
**DOD**]{.underline} (whose operations are generally authorized [under
**Title 10**]{.underline}) [continued to develop its **clandestine
capabilities**]{.underline} [for traditional military
activities]{.underline}, while the CIA (whose operations are generally
authorized under Title 50) acquired new lethal capabilities.110 This
convergence was especially evident with respect to operations carried
out by special forces and drones. After 9/11, Special Operations Forces
(SOF) became a crucial counterterrorism force. Special Operations
Command (SOCOM) has more than doubled in size since 2001 and has
commandos deployed to nearly 150 countries.111 Likewise, lethal drone
strikes have become a central element of the U.S. counterterrorism
strategy, with one database cataloging over 14,000 strikes from 2010 to
2020.112

Security cooperation efforts, including programs to train, equip, and
otherwise assist foreign defense and security forces, have also expanded
significantly since 9/11.113 Indeed, security cooperation formed the
foundation of the U.S. counter-ISIS policy in Iraq and Syria,114 and the
U.S. government spent over \$200 billion on security assistance and
security cooperation programs from 2006 to 2018.115 In 2017, Congress
authorized security cooperation funds under Title 10 U.S.C. § 127e to
support special operations to combat terrorism.116 One Green Beret
explained, § 127e programs are "less, 'We're helping you,' and more,
'You're doing our bidding.'"117 In 2017, SOCOM reportedly expended
nearly \$80 million to resource twenty-one programs under the § 127e
authority.118

[As]{.underline} the role of special forces, drones, and [**s**ecurity
**c**ooperation has grown, the oversight gaps caused by the
artificial]{.underline} [**Title 10**-Title **50** distinction have
become **increasingly apparent**]{.underline}. One scholar explained,
"When the CIA and SOF operate together on the battlefield, [the legal
distinctions regarding operating authorities and procedures, and
accountability, can become **blurred**]{.underline}."119 [This can have
**far-reaching implications** for oversight]{.underline}.120 For
example, lethal [operations can be carried out by either the **DOD** or
**CIA**]{.underline}.121 When led by the DOD, the operation falls under
Title 10 oversight by HASC and SASC.122 When led by the CIA, even with
the same operators, the operation is typically undertaken as a "covert
action" and subject to extensive but highly classified reporting to
HPSCI and SSCI under 50 U.S.C. § 3093.123 For example, the raid that
killed Osama bin Laden was executed by U.S. Navy Seals from Joint
Special Operations Command (JSOC) in the DOD.124 However, it was
classified as a Title 50 operation under the "command" of the CIA
director.125 Because it was considered a CIA operation, only the Gang of
Eight---which includes HPSCI and SSCI leadership as well as the House
and Senate leadership---was informed. The armed services and foreign
relations committees, however, were not.126

Section 127e [programs]{.underline} and activities present [further
**oversight challenges**]{.underline}. While § 127e includes reporting
requirements,127 [these operations often elude **effective oversight**.
They are typically **highly classified** and briefed only to a narrow
group of congressional members and staff]{.underline}. Former
congressional staffer Tommy Ross explained, "[Policymakers]{.underline}
and congressional staffers [who work in areas]{.underline} likely to be
**[most affected]{.underline}** [by]{.underline} 127e
operations---[traditional **foreign assistance** and **diplomacy**
activities]{.underline}, for example---[are generally not]{.underline}
included among those [briefed]{.underline} \.... **[limiting
accountability]{.underline}** [and **profoundly
challenging**]{.underline} [the government's ability to plan,
coordinate, and integrate **comprehensive assistance
packages**]{.underline}."128 [Even within a single committee, only a
**few members** are typically notified]{.underline} of sensitive
operations, and staff are sometimes excluded altogether.129

Importantly, special operations, drone strikes, and [**s**ecurity
**c**ooperation]{.underline} missions [often **fall outside** of the
oversight jurisdiction]{.underline} of HFAC and SFRC under the WPR. As
discussed in Part I,135 the executive branch has often narrowly defined
"hostilities" in the WPR to require "the presence of U.S. ground troops,
U.S. casualties or a serious threat thereof."136 This definition "allows
the President to escape the WPR whenever drones are relied
upon---regardless of the extent of a military campaign involving
drones."137 Under this contested interpretation of hostilities, the
executive branch is not obligated to report special forces operations,
including kill/capture missions, to Congress under the WPR.138 This
interpretation has largely kept HFAC and SFRC in the dark on the vast
majority of counterterrorism operations.

Moreover, [similar and sometimes overlapping training and assistance
programs can be operated by the CIA]{.underline}, which follows its own
distinct reporting regime.130 For example, the CIA reportedly spent over
\$1 billion over four years on a covert action program to support Syrian
rebels.131 This program reportedly operated alongside an overt DOD
program authorized and overseen by HASC and SASC.132 The CIA programs
would have been reported under Title 50 to HPSCI and SSCI alone, even
though they may have directly overlapped, and even competed, with
programs authorized by HASC and SASC.133 As one former staffer put it in
an interview with us, "I saw in a couple of cases some of these
[programs]{.underline} that [were not only duplicative, but
**competitive**]{.underline}. [The DOD and CIA were trying to displace
one another from the **same landscape**]{.underline}."134

[The committee will continue its **oversight**]{.underline} and
assessment of threats to U.S. national security as it considers the
fiscal year 2020 and fiscal year 2021 defense budget requests. [This
effort will involve **appropriate oversight hearings** with the
Secretary of Defense]{.underline}; the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff; the individual military service secretaries and chiefs of staff;
combatant commanders; other officials of the Department of Defense and
the military departments; officials from the intelligence community; and
the Secretary of Energy, the Under Secretary for Nuclear Security, and
other officials of the Department of Energy. In addition, [the committee
will invite the **views** and **perspectives** of **outside
experts**]{.underline} [in academia, industry, associations and advocacy
organizations]{.underline}, and those in private life with expertise on
these matters. Finally, the committee will continue its aggressive
outreach program to seek the views and perspectives of service members
and their families to include Active Duty, National Guard, and Reserve
members across the United States and at deployed locations overseas.

[The committee carries out its oversight of the Department of
Defense]{.underline} and its subordinate departments and agencies as
well as portions of the Department of Energy through activities
involving the full committee and its standing subcommittees. [The
committee will continue to conduct **robust** oversight and
investigations]{.underline} regarding matters within the jurisdiction of
the committee. [Certain issues and activities will require more
**extensive review**]{.underline}. Investigatory work that may support
the oversight responsibilities of standing subcommittees will be
conducted in a coordinated manner. Each subcommittee will conduct
oversight of the programs within its jurisdiction in accordance with the
committee's rules and the Rules of the House of Representatives.

The oversight agenda below, unless otherwise noted, is designed to
support the consideration by the committee and, ultimately, the House of
Representatives of the annual defense authorization bill, as well as the
committee's broader oversight responsibilities. The issues identified
are expected to be ongoing areas of oversight activity throughout the
116th Congress. In addition, the committee will continue to pay
attention to the mandates placed on executive departments and agencies.
In this context, pursuant to clause 2(d)(1) of rule X of the Rules of
the House of Representatives, the committee will continue to emphasize
the examination of relevant rules, regulations, statutes, and court
decisions affecting the Department of Defense and the Department of
Energy for their effects on efficiency and good management practices.

Given the unique nature of national security issues and related
oversight of the Armed Forces, the committee believes that [a qualifier
is]{.underline} once again [necessary]{.underline} with regard to the
ability [to plan **comprehensively** and predict **all** oversight
activities]{.underline}. Much of the committee's most demanding
oversight will be, by definition, event-driven and not subject to prior
planning. Such events significantly complicate the ability to prescribe
with great accuracy or specificity the committee's entire oversight
agenda. For instance, the [oversight of defense activities by the
committee has historically involved **in-depth
assessments**]{.underline} of military operations and other major events
that are generally difficult to predict in advance, such as the recent
operations in the Republic of Iraq and the Syrian Arab Republic to
counter the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, the war in the Islamic
Republic of Afghanistan, and responses to catastrophic events. These
[reviews can **dominate** committee and staff
**resources**]{.underline}, sometimes [at the **expense** of other
**planned activities**]{.underline}. The committee fully expects that
this type of event-driven oversight will continue to be required.

- U.S. engagement with partners could be dominated by military issues if

The current security assistance framework at the State Department and
the [DOD]{.underline} often [**perpetuates** the status quo by creating
incentives to **continue providing** assistance to the same
partners]{.underline}. Between congressionally mandated allocations to
large security partners in the State Department's FMF assistance and
specific authorities created for certain countries, [there are often few
built-in incentives to reexamine a partner's **record** or
**backsliding**]{.underline}. And when reviews are done, [there is
**strong resistance** to shift funding due to the potential

**[Politics]{.underline}** in this respect [will be **integral** to
outcomes in the deployment of **military AI** across
domains]{.underline}. [Strategy has always been the use of force to
achieve political objectives, but we assert that politics will shape
**how AI is used** as much as being the goal of]{.underline} the
[deployment]{.underline} of AI. What AI will not be able to do for
combined arms operations, or any other type of operation for that
matter, any time in the near future, is lift the fog of war: the veil of
uncertainty around the interests driving opponents' actions. It will not
alleviate the security dilemma and may complicate arms control and
disarmament efforts as barriers to entry are lowered due to the
acceleration of technological progress in the civilian sector.

5\. STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS

The purpose of this article is not to provide definitive conclusions as
to how AI will affect strategy. As Clausewitz often stressed, the unseen
complexities involved in military affairs do not allow for clear
answers.41 The purpose of this paper is rather to enhance understanding
of different aspects of what policymakers and military officials will
face as AI technologies are integrated into war and conflict. In that
spirit, we see several considerations as paramount to current and future
strategy and policy.

[The]{.underline} first is the **[requirement]{.underline}** [for and
the **simultaneous challenge** of **greater military-civilian**
fusion]{.underline}. We recognize this as a tautology that has always
been true. However, it seems clear that [militaries will need to develop
**much closer cooperation**]{.underline} [with the **private
sector**]{.underline} [in the development and use of AI technology
through '**spin in'** effects]{.underline}. [China has **already
recognized** this]{.underline}, as detailed by Elsa Kania in a recent
report, and is working to fuse military and state-owned enterprise
efforts to enhance China's AI capabilities and technologies.42 In this
respect, the extent to which China has an inherent advantage over the US
because of state control of private enterprise is likely to influence
the emerging power struggle over AI. China certainly has some
advantages, including a productive and innovative economic and
industrial base, and the clear articulation of national strategies
around AI, but the notion that direct control over industry confers an
advantage should be questioned. Much of historical innovation in
technology has been derived from research conducted in private
enterprises and research labs, sometimes with government funding.
China's technological progress has also been driven, at least in part,
by illegal appropriation of technologies and copyright theft, largely
through cyber espionage. This has been amply documented.43 The latest
research suggests that China faces significant challenges in developing
technologies due to the exponential increase in the complexity of
military technology and the difficulties involved in replication and
imitation.44 **[In the US]{.underline}** [and **Europe**]{.underline},
conversely, [the challenge will be to develop effective cooperation
between the military and private sector]{.underline} in the development
of AI, [while **managing concerns** around **ethics** and
**privacy**]{.underline}. Recent reports suggest that the US military is
now more trusted to develop AI systems than some of the big tech
companies such as Google and Facebook, reflecting recent controversies
around social media being used as a platform for AI-enabled information
warfare and data privacy breaches.45 However, it is our contention that
[technology must be **jointly**]{.underline} [and **collaboratively
developed**]{.underline}, and that [**military control** of AI
innovation will ultimately be **counterproductive**]{.underline},
largely because of the need to apply the technology across a wide range
of societal activity.

Throughout this series, [I have explored the most pressing foundational
issues impacting the Intelligence Community's (IC) ability to meet the
urgency of this moment in the global artificial intelligence (AI)
race]{.underline}. The current bipartisan support for taking bold action
to drive national security use of AI is key to the IC's success. That
support must propel change in the priority areas I have already
identified: modernizing the IC's budget and acquisition processes and
enabling a risk-tolerant culture with a new IC AI risk assessment
framework

that helps IC officers navigate the uncertainty that necessarily
accompanies technological innovation[. There is one other
area]{.underline}, however, [that cannot be ignored if the IC is to keep
pace with our nation's adversaries and provide policymakers with
accurate, timely, and impactful insights: congressional
oversight.]{.underline}

[**Congressional oversigh**t of the IC **is critical**. Congress is the
eyes and the ears of the American people. Among other things, it is
charged with evaluating IC program performance, and ensuring the IC is
efficiently and effectively spending taxpayer dollars and properly
executing national security activities consistent with statutory
requirements and legislative intent]{.underline}.

Adaptive Oversight

[Much like AI itself, **congressional oversight of AI activities must
evolve** and adapt to the world of emerging technology. While there are
a variety of rules that govern Congress' oversight responsibilities,
Congress has considerable latitude and discretion in the execution of
that oversight, including how they measure executive branch progress. To
improve IC oversight engagements, Congress and the IC must start with a
shared strategic vision for what a successful AI project looks like and
create an approach to oversight that is tailored to achieve this
goal.]{.underline}

Current measures and metrics often focus on ensuring projects stay on
track in terms of cost and schedule; there are well-defined outputs,
such as number of tools built, and static timelines for delivery. Such
demonstrable deliverables are objective, consistent, and easy to
measure, but they are ill-suited to AI, the underlying technology for
which is still evolving. [To take full advantage of AI's emerging
possibilities, the IC must have the ability to test, adjust, and pivot
as new algorithms and capabilities are developed and applied to
different problem sets.]{.underline}

In addition[, AI-related metrics must focus on key performance
indicators that track the progress of how AI tools evolve rather than on
only the final product to both create the opportunity for, and reflect
the expectation of, value to the user earlier based on strong
communication and feedback loops. Performance evaluation should center
on delivery of incremental capabilities, drilling down on speed and
functionality together in phases and time-boxing segmented activities,
from staffing to new releases to bug-fixes.]{.underline}

The IC and the Committees must learn from industry best practices
related to DevSecOps and software, and together develop relevant and
adaptive metrics that can be consistently applied but are more aligned
with AI's attributes. This joint process would itself serve as an
opportunity for learning and trust building. Once developed, the metrics
must continue to drive accountability and demonstrate value, and if
timelines slip, the IC must quickly inform the Committees and produce
new targets. The IC should expect to use the new metrics first on
low-risk activities and ensure the Committees understand the standards
and benchmarks the IC is using so they can evaluate programs
accordingly.

While pivoting to new metrics is a good start, the IC and the Committees
also must remain open to iteration, allowing oversight to change if the
initial approach is less than optimal.

Trust, Transparency, and Partnership

**[There is no dearth of oversight today]{.underline}** -- each year,
there are hundreds of written reports, in-person briefings, phone calls,
hearings, and other engagements between congressional overseers and the
IC. However, current oversight engagements suggest a lack of confidence
and trust in the IC; they are often excessively tactical and focused on
execution details that provide neither a strategic perspective on the
health of a program nor an understanding of potential long-term
opportunities and risks. These engagements drive a continuous cycle of
meetings and briefings, requesting deeper levels of detail, in an effort
to achieve the desired understanding. Unfortunately, layering detail on
top of detail does not produce strategic insight, and this approach is
ultimately ineffective -- the Committees do not feel sufficiently
informed and the IC does not feel sufficiently supported, steering the
relationship toward one that is more adversarial than collaborative.

[**Current oversight processes were not designed to be overly
burdensome** or act as roadblocks to progress. They were designed to
give Congress appropriate insight and confidence that executive branch
activities and spending are being carried out efficiently, effectively,
and consistently with the law]{.underline}. Unfortunately, the processes
have become onerous due to a history of issues that have undermined
Congress' trust and confidence in the IC. The IC must rebuild trust with
Congress so overseers can step back from day-to-day operational details
and engage with the community at a more appropriate strategic level.

[As the IC seeks additional flexibility from the Committees, it should
increase trust and transparency through a more informal and open posture
with Congress that includes accommodation from deliberative process
privilege as needed. This would require a significant cultural shift
but, if done carefully, would pay enormous dividends.]{.underline}

#### Development of autonomous tech implicates congressional oversight 

**CRS 21** \[Congressional Research Service; "Defense Primer: U.S.
Policy on Lethal Autonomous Weapon Systems"; November 17, 2021; DOA:
6/25/22; <https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF11150>;
Lowell-ES\]

Lethal autonomous weapon systems (LAWS) are a special class of weapon
systems that use sensor suites and computer algorithms to independently
identify a target and employ an onboard weapon system to engage and
destroy the target without manual human control of the system. Although
these systems are not yet in widespread development, it is believed they
would enable military operations in communications-degraded or -denied
environments in which traditional systems may not be able to operate.
Contrary to a number of news reports, U.S. policy does not prohibit the
development or employment of LAWS. Although the United States does not
currently have LAWS in its inventory, some senior military and defense
leaders have stated that the United States may be compelled to develop
LAWS in the future if U.S. competitors choose to do so. At the same
time, a growing number of states and nongovernmental organizations are
appealing to the international community for regulation of or a ban on
LAWS due to ethical concerns. **[Developments in both autonomous weapons
technology and international discussions of LAWS could hold implications
for congressional oversight]{.underline}**, defense investments,
military concepts of operations, treaty-making, and the future of war.

B. [Siloing and Its Implications for Oversight and National
Security]{.underline}

While committees may gain political benefits from guarding their turfs,
[information siloing **frustrates** Congress's ability to carry out
**effective oversight** of the executive branch. The information gaps
resulting from siloing of reporting and notification may lead to
**poorly informed**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[under-vetted]{.underline}** [congressional
decision-making]{.underline}. Ultimately, [information siloing of modern
military operations can harm **national security** and **foreign
relations**]{.underline}.

1\. Siloing Obstructs Deliberation and Informed Legislating

[Information siloing can obstruct **deliberation**]{.underline} and thus
block informed legislating. If an operation is briefed to only one
committee, members who are informed may lack the ability to engage in
meaningful deliberation with other members, thereby impeding a proper
response.277 A former SFRC staffer expressed the difficulty of
conducting effective oversight when the committee is left in the dark on
related operations: "\[H[\]ow can you make foreign relations policy
without having access to one of the most]{.underline} potentially
[influential capabilities to influence foreign
relations?]{.underline}"278 Another staffer illustrated the dilemma with
a hypothetical: imagine there is a critical intelligence program that
involves close cooperation with the military of a partner country.279
The foreign relations committees have not been briefed on, and are not
aware of, the program. As a result, they may not understand why the
administration refuses to press that country on its human rights
record---a record that "we would never let go generally."280 If the
foreign relations committees do not know about the intelligence program,
they would be unable to understand why U.S. foreign policy toward that
country contradicts our values. And they would not be in a position to
discuss the appropriateness of this foreign policy trade-off.281 When
issues are briefed just to the Gang of Eight, [the problems of
**impeded** information sharing become particularly acute]{.underline}.
As a former staffer explained, "Then it's just a small group of members.
[It causes all kinds of **spillover** effects]{.underline}."282 For
instance, when Congress was asked to reauthorize the § 215 collection
program in 2011, most members were unaware of existing bulk collection
programs carried out under intelligence authorities.283 Committee
members had to fight to get a document describing these activities
opened up to members, and then only in a Sensitive Compartmented
Information Facility (SCIF) at the TS/SCI level.284 If that had not been
done, members voting on the reauthorization would have been entirely
unaware of how it interacted with existing collection programs.285

Indeed, [to exercise]{.underline} their [authorities over]{.underline}
the process of commencing war via authorizations for [the]{.underline}
**[use of force]{.underline}** or restricting uses of force through the
WPR, [the foreign relations committees must be **fully
informed**]{.underline} [of uses of U.S. military power]{.underline}.
After the Soleimani strike, for example, the foreign relations
committees weighed what might be an appropriate response to Iranian
retaliation, while being left in the dark about the ongoing or potential
cyber, intelligence, and other operations between the United States and
Iran.286 While the Senate and House ultimately voted to restrain the
President from using force, [better information sharing
would]{.underline} have [allow]{.underline}ed the [senators to make a
more **informed decision**]{.underline}.287

[Information siloing poses a particularly **acute
challenge**]{.underline} [to deliberation and informed legislating on
**cross-jurisdictional** issues like **cyber operations**]{.underline}.
As a DOD lawyer observed, congressional committees "are not structured
to take a holistic approach to the problem of cyberspace," which
challenges traditional paradigms of jurisdiction that are focused on
physical spaces (for example, commercial, domestic, and overseas) and
actors (for example, government agencies, departments, and private
sector).288 Cyber operations and cybersecurity transcend these
distinctions and cut across issues of foreign affairs, intelligence, and
defense, but congressional committees remain confined by these
parameters. The Cyberspace Solarium Commission observed that [the
**dispersal** of oversight responsibilities]{.underline} across numerous
committees and subcommittees "[prevents Congress from **effectively
providing strategic oversight** of the executive branch's cybersecurity
efforts]{.underline} or exerting its traditional oversight authority for
executive action and policy in cyberspace."289 [Information siloing also
complicates oversight over military cyber operations, which **blur** the
**jurisdictional lines**]{.underline} between Title 10 and Title 50 that
traditionally divided military and intelligence oversight [within
Congress]{.underline}.290 As Tressa Guenov and Tommy Ross have observed,
"[It is]{.underline} nearly **[impossible]{.underline}** [to consider
**cyber deterrence**]{.underline} [and the role of **o**ffensive
**c**yber attacks in military operations without **encroaching**
on]{.underline} business, homeland security, **[foreign
policy]{.underline}**, and criminal justice [issues]{.underline}."291

Information siloing also limits the ability of committees to consider
how various legislative actions might affect and be affected by other
programs already in place. Consider a hypothetical example involving
Russia. In weighing whether and how to craft sanctions legislation
against Russia for election interference, the foreign relations
committees should have an understanding of all the tools brought to bear
against Russia to counter or deter meddling---including cyber
operations, such as those carried out by Cyber Command during the 2018
midterm elections.292 More generally, as relations with Russia remain
tense, since the foreign relations committees are charged with
overseeing the executive's conduct of foreign relations with Russia,293
[it is critical that they understand]{.underline} the full nature of the
bilateral relationship, including [**hostile** and **potentially
escalatory** activities like **military cyber operations**]{.underline}.
However, although there may be informal exchanges of information, [the
DOD is under no statutory obligation to report cyber operations against
Russia to the foreign relations committees]{.underline}.294

The foreign relations committees are particularly affected by their lack
of access to information about other programs and operations. While
successive iterations of the NDAA have established new reporting and
notification requirements for modern military operations, the reports
almost all go to the armed services committees. The foreign relations
committees receive virtually none of that information. This is even the
case for operations with implications falling squarely within the
foreign relations committees' jurisdiction. One telling example is the
aforementioned FY 2019 NDAA, which functions as a quasi-AUMF for cyber
operations against Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran.295 The
consequences extend beyond the committees' role in use of force
authorizations, as well. For example, as described earlier, when HFAC
was considering a "massive Pakistan aid package," the CIA failed to
inform the committee of the drone program in that country, even though
it had obvious implications for U.S.-Pakistan relations.296 HFAC
chairman Howard Berman was ultimately informed about the drone program,
but he could not share the information with the rest of the committee
because he was the only member read into the highly classified
program.297 And in 2014, the SFRC considered and supported legislation
to train and equip Syrian rebels, even though the chair and ranking
member did not know any details of what media later reported to be the
CIA's parallel covert program,298 which had been initiated the year
before.299

2\. Siloing Means No Committee Has the Complete Picture

Information siloing means that no committee---and [no
member]{.underline}--- [has the **complete picture**]{.underline} [of
modern warfare operations]{.underline}. As a result, [members are often
called on to make crucial decisions without the **full range** of
**relevant information**]{.underline} in hand. Based on our interviews,
information siloing appears to be a particularly significant problem in
the counterterrorism context, including special forces operations and
drone strikes.300 As former National Security Council Director for
Counterterrorism Daniel Rosenthal explained:

> \[N\]umerous members of Congress, countless congressional staffers,
> and multiple committees all have access to some information about the
> drone program\.... \[N\]o single member of Congress, congressional

The tragic events in Niger that led to the deaths of American special
forces, recounted at the outset of this Article, illustrate some of the
dangers that can result from this lack of visibility. Those deaths might
have been avoided if not for the siloed oversight over those operations,
which meant that no one in Congress was aware of the full extent of U.S.
involvement in the country. Even when there is the rare collaboration
between committees, the foreign relations committees are often the odd
man out. This is true even though counterterrorism operations generally
require the approval of the U.S. embassy for the country where the
operation will take place.302 U.S. embassies and consulates are part of
the State Department (organized under the Bureau of Consular Affairs)303
and thus under the oversight jurisdiction of the foreign relations
committees.304 These committees are rarely notified of counterterrorism
operations, despite the fact that they oversee embassies and diplomatic
relations.305 This information gap thus inhibits the committees'
capacity to effectively oversee the agency for which they are
responsible.

Information sharing restrictions and narrow notification and reporting
obligations allow the executive branch to control committees' access to
information. Like the foreign relations committees, the intelligence
committees generally do not receive reporting or notification on
military cyber operations. As one congressional staffer observed, "When
it comes to DOD activities, HPSCI feels itself pretty frozen out."306
The intelligence committees are only briefed on operations conducted
under intelligence authorities. If Cyber Command and the CIA conduct
coordinated or supported cyberattacks, each agency will brief its
respective oversight committee on its own activities, and neither
committee will have the full picture.307 Moreover, it is often up to the
executive to determine how much of a joint operation to disclose.308

Indeed, agencies sometimes exploit congressional committee
jurisdictional divisions and turf wars to avoid onerous oversight. In
the case of cyber operations, the armed services committees are
perceived by some observers as friendlier to the military and less
willing to engage in rigorous oversight.309 The executive branch "will
hand-feed the congressional committees that they care about, but they
will do anything in their power to avoid cooperating with the 'other'
committees."310 As a former Cyber Command lawyer put it, "If you're the
CIA you may say you aren't talking to the armed service committees, they
do not have my interests at heart, and vice versa."311 Information silos
can thus privilege the executive branch at Congress's expense.

3\. Information Siloing Exacerbates Institutional Jealousies and Impedes
Agency Coordination

Information [siloing may reinforce interagency competition within the
executive branch, which may **inhibit** the government's broader
capacity to effectively address security threats]{.underline}. Andru
Wall explains that [siloing is]{.underline} both "**[legally
incongruous]{.underline}** [and **operationally dangerous**]{.underline}
[because]{.underline} it suggests statutory authorities are mutually
exclusive and [it creates concerns about interagency
cooperation]{.underline} at exactly the time in history when our policy
and legal structures should be encouraging increased interagency
coordination and cooperation against interconnected national security
threats."312 In fact, when agencies compete with one another, they can
leverage information silos to advance their own equities with their
congressional patrons.

A former congressional staff member recalled an incident in which the
CIA and the DOD sought to displace each other from parallel operations
in the same country, which included efforts to elevate concerns up to
the host country's head of state. "The oversight seams made this
challenging," the staff member recalled, "on these committees, the
agencies played members off each other, getting members to be advocates
for them rather than overseers."313 Members of Congress made calls to
the White House on behalf of their agencies, asking why the other agency
was involved. "This was embarrassing from an oversight standpoint, but
also potentially damaging from a national security standpoint," the
staffer added.314

\* \* \*

This Part has examined the ways in which information siloing impedes
Congress's ability to provide effective oversight of modern warfare and
thus harms national security. Ironically, while Congress publicly
recognizes the challenges facing executive branch coordination and has
urged stronger coordination,315 it has not applied the same logic or
solutions to its own institutional structure. [Siloing]{.underline},
therefore, does not merely cut out certain committees, but it also
[hinders Congress's ability to effectively carry out its
**legislating**, **war making**, and **oversight**]{.underline} roles.
The next Part considers possible reforms to address this problem.

#### Cyber [cooperation]{.underline} and [info sharing]{.underline} uniquely challenge oversight.

**Lewallen 20** \[Jonathan Lewallen, Assistant Professor, University of
Tampa; \"Cybersecurity Information Sharing and Congress\'s Oversight
Role\"; 66 Wayne Law Review 151; Published: 2020; Accessed: 6-20-2022;

KL\]

Members of Congress value position-taking and credit-claiming
opportunities, and legislative activity and constituent service tend to
provide those opportunities to a greater degree than oversight;
legislative action tends to be more visible than all but the
highest-profile oversight hearings. 4 0 To the extent that oversight
provides clear position-taking opportunities, it does so when either
district, state, or party interests are involved. **[Cybersecurity
information sharing]{.underline}** may be a case where the lack of a
clear partisan dimension [hinders]{.underline} the prospects for
**[effective oversight]{.underline}**; members of the presidential
out-party lack obvious incentives to elevate attention to information
sharing by embarrassing the current administration

Another challenge is not necessarily unique to cybersecurity information
sharing: how to measure whether oversight activities were successful.
The stated congressional policy (as expressed through law) is for
agencies to coordinate information exchange about cybersecurity threats
with SLTT governments and the private sector. Sharing more information
cannot be the end goal because too much information can actually be less
helpful.\' 4 \' Cybersecurity threats change over time and, thus, so
will the specific information about those threats that would need to be
shared, which in turn changes some of the appropriate metrics of
\"success.\" Is sharing the information alone enough to consider the
policy successful, or does that information also have to be timely and
acted upon?

One general oversight challenge is specific to information sharing: the
information related to cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities is to
flow between agencies, SLTT governments, and the private sector without
also flowing to Congress. [Legislators already face an **information
disadvantage** relative to the bureaucracy]{.underline}; bureaucrats
know more about the policy problems and likely effects of proposed
alternatives to a greater degree.\' [That disadvantage may be
**exacerbated** with cybersecurity information sharing]{.underline}:
[Congress does not know what information agencies and companies could be
but are not sharing]{.underline}. And whereas Congress can rely on
constituents, interest groups, and other \"fire alarms\" to help reduce
its information asymmetry for other policies,\"\' almost by definition
these groups do not know what information agencies are not sharing,
either. Conversely, the problem definition and uncertainty reduction
functions that bureaucracies perform for Congress may suffer because
agencies also do not know what threat or vulnerability information the
private sector is not sharing. Congress finds itself in a position of
promotion-\"what can we do to help?\"- without knowing what kind of
information would be shared with more resources, incentives, and
support. And while oversight does not necessarily have to be
adversarial, that advocacy position creates a conundrum: Congress can
provide positive incentives for participation or improvement but fewer
sanctions for non-participation.

[**Overlapping** agency responsibility for cybersecurity]{.underline}
generally and information sharing specifically [poses **another
challenge** to effective congressional oversight]{.underline}. Multiple
agencies may share information about the same cyber vulnerabilities and
threats, [which]{.underline} then [**creates confusion** about
responsibility for]{.underline} both the private sector and for
[Congress]{.underline}. 1 4 The Department of Health and Human Services
played a significant role in notifying the U.S. health care sector about
the 2018 \"WannaCry\" ransomware attack on entities and industries
around the world (including the British National Health Service), but
some legislators looked to the DHS and Office of Management and Budget
for a response in the attack\'s aftermath.14 1 Overlapping
responsibility may also manifest when agencies share information with,
or receive information from, an industry outside its traditional
substantive jurisdiction, as when the Department of Homeland Security
shares vulnerability information about healthcare devices or when the
Department of Defense Cyber Command works with the banking sector. 146
Changing technology can make new industries vulnerable and require
information sharing in a new domain; the U.S. Farm Credit
Administration, for example, recently moved to \"cloud computing\" and,
thus, created new data and system vulnerabilities relevant to
cybersecurity information sharing policies and introduced agriculture
policy, concerns into the cybersecurity domain.1 47

Overlap in agency responsibility and issue involvement raises questions
about who in Congress is responsible for conducting oversight; in the
Farm Credit Administration case, would it be the homeland security or
the agriculture committees? Both have some claim to jurisdiction, and
the resulting competition and turf battles among committees can send
conflicting signals to agencies about congressional directives. 148
[Legislative **turf battles**]{.underline}, then, [can lead to more
**agency overlap**]{.underline} as committees advocate for the agencies
under their jurisdiction to gain authority over cybersecurity
information sharing, which in turn would give those committees more
policymaking authority in the future. 149

#### Cyber [friction]{.underline} impacts oversight. Only [transparency]{.underline} can ensure [public support]{.underline}, [trust]{.underline}, and [adherence]{.underline}.

A. INHERENT TENSION SURROUNDING NATIONAL SECURITY MATTERS

Sensitive information, which has national security significance, must be
safeguarded to ensure the vital national security interests of any
nation state. So many aspects of cybersecurity have the potential for
use by: terrorists; foreign entities as a tool to conduct industrial
espionage against U.S. business; and nation state adversaries, or others
intent upon creating serious disruptions. These various threats mean
that cybersecurity policy in many ways must be treated just like the
strategic and operational plans of a country at war.33

Admiral Bob Inman, USN (Retired) is [former **Director** of the
**N**ational **S**ecurity **A**gency]{.underline}, [Deputy **Director**

capitalist and seasoned corporate director of many well known and
important U.S. corporations such as AT&T, Fluor, SAIC, Xerox (just to
name a few). In the author's opinion, Admiral Inman is perhaps the most
experienced and thoughtful senior executive in the U.S. intelligence
community. During congressional testimony, Admiral Inman counseled

During his Senate confirmation hearings to become Deputy Director of
Central Intelligence, Robert M. Gates said, "Intelligence is a force
multiplier for military operations. It more than pays for itself.
There's no sense in building new weapons if you can't detect and assess
enemy threats, or even identify targets during crisis."35 Gates believes
that [congressional oversight of the U.S. intelligence community and
activities is]{.underline} "[a **key element**]{.underline} [in
preserving intelligence programs, and in maintaining **public
understanding** and **support** for intelligence]{.underline}."36
Indeed, "[the **gravest danger**]{.underline} [facing intelligence is
that]{.underline} intelligence studies, or even [intelligence
operations]{.underline}, [may become influenced by]{.underline} policy
or even **[political influences]{.underline}**. Every effort must be
made to see that intelligence reports and analyses are not made into
props for policymakers. Intelligence has to be completely objective." 37

Admiral Michael S. Rogers was questioned at length by Senators McCain,
Reed, Inhofe, Wicker, Ayotte, Lee, Manchin, Blumenthal, Donnelly, Kaine
and King during his confirmation hearing to become: Director of the
National Security Agency; Chief, Central Security Services; and
Commander, U.S. Cyber Command. When asked by Senator Tim Kayne to speak
about the "unique challenges in defining 'war' in cyberspace, what war
is, what hostilities are, what military action is," Admiral Rogers
responded

Professor Frederick R. Chang, former National Security Agency ("NSA")
Director of Research said in congressional testimony that, "we are
paying a heavy price for our technological dependence and the problem is
worsening with the passage of time. Our trust in cyberspace has been
taken from us by hackers, cybercriminals and sophisticated cyber
attackers who intend to do us harm."40 Towards the end of 2010 Senator
John McCain observed

Thoughtful observers remain mindful that "the issue of congressional
oversight of intelligence is complex, combining as it does the political
and structural complexities of Congress with the difficulty of
monitoring something of strategic significance that, by definition,
operates in the shadows."42 Professor Jennifer Kibbe stated that
"intelligence is more crucial than ever to national security, but as the
executive branch and the intelligence community try to maximize the
utility of intelligence in meeting national security needs, it is
imperative that the congressional overseers meet their obligations as
well."43 Professor Kibbe offers the following three reasons that
[congressional oversight of intelligence-related issues is
**particularly important**]{.underline}

Next, [there are new questions about the nature of presidential and
congressional oversight.]{.underline} The [**new statutory authorization
allows for a range of offensive cyberspace operation**s that could be
properly characterized as a covert action, but **absent executive
oversight required,**]{.underline} such as is required for a
presidential finding and Memorandum of Notification to the Congressional
intelligence committees. 50 [The new language creates an important
change in congressional reporting requirements; the statute provides
that \"\[the Secretary of Defense\] shall brief the congressional
defense committees about any military activities or operations in
cyberspace, including clandestine military activities or operations in
cyberspace, occurring during the previous quarter during the quarterly
briefing required by section 484 of this titl]{.underline}e.\"\'5 1 In
other words, [the DoD and U.S. CYBERCOM can conduct a broader range of
offensive cyberspace operations, some which may be construed by an
adversary as a hostile or wrongful act in violation of international
law, but the Secretary of Defense is no longer constrained by the
requirement of a presidential finding,]{.underline} Congressional
leadership. In one sense, the 2019 NDAA has a broader requirement for
congressional reporting than the covert action statute; the 2019 NDAA
does not include a provision that could be used to limit congressional
reporting on sensitive military cyber operations to the \"gang of eight.
\'5 4 [**The traditional controls on uses of force**, whether involving
covert actions or armed conflict, exist to **ensure executive and
congressional oversight,** as well as political accountability through
elections, in the conduct of U.S. foreign policy]{.underline}.55 There
is a distinct difference between purely defensive actions, which are
either responses against an on-going attack or the preparation of
capabilities for prospective conflict, and offensive operations that
could initiate or escalate a crisis. On one hand, it is true that the
DoD experienced difficulties in obtaining mission approval within the
executive branch for peacetime cyber operations that involved conduct
beyond intelligence collection or a response to an on- going attack.
That there has been disagreement over the propriety of certain
activities is no doubt a reflection on the unique nature of certain
cyber activities and the perhaps unknowable consequences that may result
from them. Indeed, the United States has periodically faced intelligence
crises resulting from ill- advised operations, such as the 1985-87
Iran-Contra affairs, that had been decided within a limited group of
senior officials, without the benefit of interagency review and
debate.56 Thus, the short-circuited approval process encapsulated in the
2019 NDAA albeit to intended to facilitate timely responses to on-going
attacks is not necessarily a positive development. However, [strong
presidential control and prior congressional notification perform an
important function: they ensure that the United States uses
unacknowledged force only in pursuit of \"identifiable foreign policy
objectives of the United States and is important to the national
security of the United States]{.underline}.\"\'5 7 The need to inhibit
unintended escalation with a foreign adversary mandates high quality
intelligence to minimize the risk of misattribution and collateral
damage, as well as tight political control. [Now, however**, the DoD can
conduct a range of offensive cyberspace operations**]{.underline} (i.e.,
\"defend forward\" 52 prior or contemporaneous reporting to Congress, 53
or even reporting to the senior through \"persistent engagement\" 58 )
independent of any explicit finding to that effect. [The DoD has the
authority to conduct a broad range of activities that it may consider
\"short of hostilities,\" 59 but ones that an adversary may consider as
a hostile or internationally wrongful act.]{.underline}

The [absence of data may make it difficult for Congress to determine to
what extent the flexibilities are used, and what challenges may inhibit
their maximum use.]{.underline} Ultimately, [this could affect future
decisions regarding the authorization of additional flexibilities or
changes to the structure of existing flexibilities.]{.underline} For
example, suppose that DHS uses the OPM-issued hiring flexibility to fill
200 cybersecurity positions---20% of the maximum allowed by the
flexibility (up to 1,000 positions). If DHS had no additional positions
to fill, additional flexibilities might not be needed. If DHS
encountered implementation challenges that prevented further use of the
flexibility, however, structural changes to the flexibility may be
needed. Similarly, suppose that DHS does not use the pay flexibilities
authorized under P.L. 113-277. While the lack of use could indicate that
the flexibilities are not needed, it may also stem from budget
constraints. A [lack of data on how frequently the flexibilities for DOD
intelligence positions are being used to fill positions affiliated with
the U.S. Cyber Command may make it difficult for Congress to gauge the
utility of new flexibilities authorized for Command
positions]{.underline} under P.L. 114-92. [It appears that some
positions affiliated with the Command are being filled using the
existing flexibilities for DOD intelligence positions.]{.underline} The
Departments of the Army and Navy, for example, are using the
flexibilities to fill cybersecurity positions in units that support the
Command. 79 [The flexibilities, therefore, might not be needed as much
or used as often as envisioned if a sizeable portion of covered
positions can be filled using existing flexibilities. Pursuant to its
oversight authority, Congress could consider several oversight policy
options to enhance its knowledge and awareness of identification and
recruitment efforts for the federal cybersecurity
workforce.]{.underline} Seven options are presented in this section,
though other policy options exist[. The first two policy options relate
to monitoring OPM and OMB initiatives to define and identify federal
cybersecurity positions. The remaining five options relate to monitoring
the implementation of hiring and pay flexibilities used to fill DOD and
DHS cybersecurity positions]{.underline}. CRS takes no position on the
advisability of these and other potential policy options. DOD and DHS
could be required to report their use of OPM-issued hiring flexibilities
for cybersecurity positions. The requirements could include, (1) the
number of positions filled using the flexibility; (2) the pay plan,
occupation, series, and grade of the position; (3) the nature of action
of each hire; and (4) any challenges encountered in implementing the
flexibilities[. Such data might enhance Congress's capacity to determine
the extent to which these flexibilities are being, or have been
used---and any barriers to maximizing their use. This information could,
in turn, assist Congress in addressing any barriers to using statutorily
authorized flexibilities and determining the utility of additional
flexibilities]{.underline}

When in the 1970s the Congress created the two committees dedicated to
the oversight of intelligence, the overall goal was to achieve awareness
of intelligence activities.\" Since then, **[the Intelligence Community
size, budget, and capabilities have grown exponentially, increasing the
challenge of maintaining this awareness and conducting
oversight]{.underline}**. **[Many of the advantages and disadvantages of
the three courses of action above relate to the ability of the Congress
to effectively maintain accountability of the intelligence
services]{.underline}** rather than increased transparency to the
public. [All three involve trade-offs with regard to the cost of
conducting oversight, measured in dollars, hours, and trees]{.underline}
(to create paper). A strong argument can be made that, despite the
criticism of the 9/11 Commission, academics, and the press, U.S.
Congressional intelligence oversight is among the best in the world.
Oversight is occurring and there has been greater accountability and
transparency in the past three years in particular. Because effective
oversight is occurring, option one, maintaining the status quo of a
strong oversight mandate, is the most acceptable option. Option two is
not recommended because there is likely never to be sufficient political
will to adopt a joint intelligence oversight committee. However, if the
Congress does want to make a change and still keep its strong oversight
committees, option three is unique in that it creates a central point of
contact into Congress to liaison directly with the public. This type of
position may fill a gap that may grow wider in the post-9/11 world---the
gap between the public and its government that is best bridged through
accountability and transparency. Despite the best intentions of the
government, its actions can be flawed in practice and a law can be the
cause of inequity or injustice. The German Bundestag model of a
Petitions Committee can serve as a central point of contact for citizens
to contact Congress with a complaint or suggestion for legislation. This
can be a bold new way for Congress to express its commitment to
transparency and accountability and mitigate growing concerns, in
particular, regarding the activities of our intelligence services.

Summary

The [Biden]{.underline} administration has multiple competing
priorities: COVID-19 and its economic impacts, long-ignored racial
fissures, and a growing tenuous relationship with truth, reality, and
trust among the populace, just to name a few. President Joseph Biden
also has the challenge of representing the United States on the foreign
stage. In that capacity, he [is charged with]{.underline} crafting [a
**new foreign policy**]{.underline}---[one that champions a **balance**
of hard and soft power, tailored for the **most efficient
use**]{.underline} [of resources and the **most effective
results**]{.underline}. [He is off to a **good start**]{.underline}; in
his interim national security guidance released in early March,
President [Biden **acknowledges** the role of soft power resources in
building and maintaining U.S. strength]{.underline}, even if he doesn't
call the concept out by name. He posits, Focusing on economic strength,
alliances, and institutions and exporting American values and ideals are
good starts to restoring American soft power abroad---[a **critical
component** of American leadership]{.underline}. In fact, the post-WWII
world order, and, more recently, the post-Cold War international system
with the United States emerging at the sole superpower, was only
possible through U.S. soft power. Historically, the United States has
maintained its power and influence abroad, in part, due to its appeal.
This appeal must be restored. This is not a call for a post-Trump 180,
the path away from soft power and towards a hard power-dominant foreign
policy is decades-long. True reinvigoration is going to require not only
a criticism of the past four years, but also deep introspection on
President Biden's own contribution to the trend as a senator and vice
president. In other words, building a smart power approach to foreign
policy is going to take more than simply rejoining a few international
accords or hosting some impressive state dinners. Frankly, it's going to
take more time than this administration has, even with the possibility
of a second term. But if we take Biden at his promise to serve as a
transitional leader, [we can]{.underline} certainly [start rebuilding
the **foundation**]{.underline} [of a foreign policy
approach]{.underline} that will serve generations of Americans and
citizens abroad for decades. [This starts with **rebuilding
relationships**]{.underline}. Based on Biden's picks for high-level
positions, it appears that he understands the power of relationships,
choosing long-term confidants and establishment experts. Biden values
trust and interpersonal history---and this approach must be applied to
international relations. President Biden campaigned on his personal
relationships with key international leaders, which is critical, but the
administration must also craft relationships with populations and other
non-state actors. While the new administration understands the potential
threat from non-state actions, it would be well-advised to also consider
the potential opportunities in non-state groups and craft a national
security strategy that acknowledges the growing power and role of such
groups. For example, this strategy must include a prioritization of
immigration and refugee programs, such as the Special Immigration Visa
Program. While the Trump administration infamously decreased the levels
of immigrants admitted under this program, the United States has
arguably never fulfilled its responsibilities to the men and women who
have assisted missions in Afghanistan and Iraq. Not only should the
Biden administration reintroduce the Iraqi Special Immigrant Visa (SIV)
Program, but it also should offer a permanent fix to the Afghan program
as well as create a new program to reward our allies in the Syrian
conflict. Such programs would establish the United States as a leader in
refugee rights and protections. The success of future conflicts will be
heavily reliant on the ability to gain and maintain the trust of
civilian populaces. Without interpreters, translators, and other
host-nation citizens, the success of U.S. missions abroad would and will
continue to be threatened. More than that, failing to uphold promises to
allies abroad threatens American legitimacy and standing in the
international community. In the new world order described by the
administration, these wicked international problems "respect no borders
or walls, and must be met with collective action." While the COVID-19
pandemic has made the increasingly global nature of the international
order abundantly clear, **[biological disease]{.underline}** isn't the
first challenge to transcend borders.
**[Counterterrorism]{.underline}**, [the threat of **nuclear
war**]{.underline}, **[economic structures]{.underline}**, [and
**climate change**]{.underline} [all present challenges]{.underline} not
to a single state or region, but [to an entire **international
structure**]{.underline}. [These problems can only be addressed with
**global solutions**]{.underline}. Unfortunately, relationships are more
easily broken than repaired, and the United States has been breaking
relationships with allies aboard for decades. Take, for example, the
spying controversies of the Obama and Bush administrations and repeated
criticisms of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization by President Trump.
The Biden administration can---and must---repair these relationships
with verbal commitments, and it must back up these promises with action.
Moreover, President Biden must be careful that these relationships are
built between world leaders and the United States, not just with the
Biden administration. Nations do not want to build relations with a
four-year president or a two-year Congress. [Foreign partners want
**lasting relationships**]{.underline} [with the American
nation]{.underline}. [This will require]{.underline} Biden to return to
his political home: **[Congress]{.underline}**. He must work with
Congress to pass legislation that cannot be overturned with executive
orders by future administrations. In this sense, it not only matters
what Biden does, but also how he does it. While the executive branch has
sweeping powers when it comes to foreign policy, [**unilateral**
executive action will **not be enough**]{.underline} [to
rebuild]{.underline} U.S. international [power and
influence]{.underline}. It's one thing to rejoin the Paris Climate
Agreement, but it's another to live up to a global commitment to
combatting climate change. President [Biden **must**]{.underline} also
**[rebuild]{.underline}** [the **primary institutions**]{.underline}
[which govern]{.underline} (or should govern) [American foreign
policy]{.underline}: the Intelligence Community and [the **Department of
State**]{.underline}. The Intelligence Community, among other reforms,
must be remade. It must evolve, or rather be revolutionized from a
hierarchy centered on collection and technology into a flattened
community driven by analysis. This community must be flexible,
adaptable, and empowered to adjust to the information age, to include
the robust inclusion, or even prioritization, of open source
intelligence. For too long, the United States has thrown money and
advanced technology at the Intelligence Community, under the premise
that more information makes for better intelligence. Unfortunately,
"more" information is not always necessary nor sufficient for better
intelligence, and the overreliance on such goals has led to an
Intelligence Community deficient in quality analysis and timely
assessments.

Congress' defense of NATO against the Trump administration's efforts to
undermine the alliance illustrates the direct and indirect ways in which
lawmakers can push back against the executive-branch. Congress inserted
language in the National Defense Authorization Act to block withdrawal
of U.S. troops from Germany, while the House passed a resolution
prohibiting the use of U.S. funds to withdraw from NATO. In a highly
symbolic move, Congress invited NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg
to address the legislature.50 In addition, Speaker of the House Nancy
Pelosi led a delegation to the Munich Security Conference, a prominent
transatlantic policy conference, where members emphasized Congress'
involvement in foreign policy to counteract allies' fears about Trump's
behavior. 51 Congress' active efforts during this period affirm the
broader proposition of this report -- that [Congress does play a role in
foreign policy issues like **alliance management**]{.underline}.52 The
question is whether lawmakers will be willing to play that role in
future administrations when alliances are no longer seen as being under
threat.

"**[Bad cop]{.underline}**" [for allies]{.underline}. [The function of
**critiquing** undesirable actions extends to foreign
nations]{.underline}. [Congress frequently serves as a useful source of
**pressure** on other countries]{.underline}, drawing attention to
problematic behavior and [**opening the door** for the executive branch
to follow up with **negotiations**]{.underline} or other measures.

[When it comes to NATO, Congress has played the]{.underline} "**[bad
cop]{.underline}**" most [frequently in the area of
**burden-sharing**]{.underline}. [Members routinely put pressure on
allies to increase their **contributions**]{.underline} to the alliance,
[which gives executive-branch negotiators **political
cover**]{.underline} [to make the same demand because they can claim
Congress is tying their hands]{.underline}. NATO expert Stanley Sloan is
worth quoting at length on the history of congressional involvement in
burden-sharing:

> From the very beginning, the congressional partner regularly raised
> questions about the persistent burden-sharing issue. This questioning
> began with the initial debate in the Senate on whether it should give
> its advice and consent to the Treaty. The administration of President
> Harry Truman reassured senators that the European allies would
> contribute to their own defense and that the United States would not
> end up carrying a disproportionate share of the burden. As the
> European states recovered from the devastation of World War II, some
> senators argued that the Europeans had become capable of defending
> themselves. Montana's Senator Mike Mansfield (D) famously promoted
> resolutions from the mid-1960s into the early 1970s that sought to
> force administrations to begin withdrawing US forces from Europe.
> While US administrations---Democratic and Republican---sought to
> contain the financial burdens and to get the Europeans to compensate
> the United States for some of NATO's costs, the established pattern
> persisted into the post-- Cold War years. Over all these years,

[Interviewees with experience in the executive branch repeatedly told
me]{.underline} that [congressional "**complaining**" or
"needling]{.underline}," sometimes [seen as unproductive
grandstanding]{.underline}, [is actually a **useful** way to **pressure
allies** and get issues on the agenda]{.underline}.54 To be sure,
congressional critiques can also cause headaches for the executive
branch if they create diplomatic friction. Interviewees emphasized the
need for useful congressional pressure that is coordinated with the
executive and stops short of disrupting fragile bilateral relationships.

[Spotlighting **rights abuses** abroad. Congress is]{.underline}
similarly [well-suited to draw attention to violations of **human
rights**]{.underline} [and other **illiberal behavior** in foreign
countries]{.underline}. In addition to the reasons above,
[Congress]{.underline} has an advantage in this area because it
[interacts **directly** with issue-based advocacy groups]{.underline},
which frequently lobby members to take action on issues like arms sales
and human rights.55

[Members can target other countries' bad behavior in a variety of
ways]{.underline}. [They may bring resolutions]{.underline}, circulate
"Dear Colleague" letters, [or condemn the behavior in floor
statements]{.underline} or in the media. One of the most common tactics
is also the most controversial: sanctions. The experts I interviewed
were nearly unanimous in their agreement that Congress over-relies on
sanctions. As American University's Jordan Tama told me, "It tends to be
a way for Congress to be able to demonstrate that it's doing something
without an issue without being particularly costly. You don't have to
spend money to impose sanctions, so there's no need for
appropriations."56 Indeed, sanctions may have become a go-to tool
precisely because they are one of the few things that are still easy for
Congress to do in today's climate.

Sanctions have proved especially frustrating in the case of Turkey,
which is subject to U.S. sanctions due to its purchase of the S-400
missile system from Russia. Interviewees expressed concern that Congress
would not be able to unwind the sanctions on Turkey even after it came
into compliance with U.S. demands, and worried more generally that
Congress had over-involved itself. 57 In this way, a congressional
effort to punish bad behavior by an ally may have overstepped its bounds
and crossed into the territory of undermining a delicate relationship.

In general, [Congress' strength lies in **calling attention** to bad
behavior and getting it on the **bilateral agenda**]{.underline} -- but
then stepping aside to let diplomats negotiate with the problematic
partner, a process that is often delicate. One former Senate staffer
invoked the common saying that "Congress is a hammer, not a scalpel,"58
while a current staffer similarly described the role as that of a
"sharpener." "Our job," this staffer argued, "is to take the plans and
policies of the executive branch and improve them. That is where we can
add the most value, especially in foreign policy."59

[Influencing the **executive agenda** and shaping the
**narrative**]{.underline}: [A third set of strengths has to do with
Congress' ability to **put priorities** on the executive branch's
agenda]{.underline} and generally shape the domestic and international
narrative around particular issues.60 These strengths, which are closely
related to the "calling out wrongdoing" idea, similarly stem from
Congress' status as the representative of the American people, which
endows its priorities with a unique legitimacy.

Narrative-shaping through hearings and more: Congressional attention to
a given foreign policy priority can significantly influence the debate
over that issue at home and abroad. Interviewees who have worked in the
executive branch and with NATO agreed that both actors pay close
attention to what happens in Congress. As Fontaine and Schulman argue,
"[Congress can play a **vital role** in **encouraging**]{.underline},
convening, and organizing public and alternative sources of
[information]{.underline}."61 For instance, they argue that
[congressional hearings can **uncover new issues**]{.underline} or new
ways of thinking about old issues. 62 Nicholas Burns, former U.S.
ambassador to NATO, told me that calling a hearing "shines a bright
light on a big issue\...It's a convening power to ask members of the
administration to appear before Congress and to engage in conversation
and debate about the administration\'s policies."63 As a 2018 Foreign
Affairs article noted, "Hearings and investigations draw attention to
neglected issues and can force administrations to rethink decisions.
They can divert the executive branch from its priorities and focus the
attention of the press."64

The same applies to other non-legislative tools such as requests for
briefings, resolutions, letters to the president and Cabinet officials,
floor statements, and media interviews. 65 Even resolutions, far from
serving a purely symbolic function, can frame the narrative and push the
administration to care about something.66

Reporting requirements: [Congress can]{.underline} also influence the
executive branch's agenda by [request]{.underline}ing a report on a
particular issue, such as the amount each NATO ally is spending on
defense.67 The executive branch sometimes dismisses congressionally
mandated reports as busy work and even a waste of taxpayer money68, but
Hill staffers argued that reports force the administration to pay
attention to an issue. 69 "The point is not to get the report," one
emphasized. "[The]{.underline} point is to make a bunch of people think
about it."70

[Informal authority, **institutional memory**, and
**longevity**]{.underline}: [Current]{.underline} and former [staffers
pointed out that the executive branch **relies heavily**]{.underline}
[on Congress because congressional staffers' tenures last **much
longer** than a presidential administration]{.underline}. Committee
[staff]{.underline} in particular [have **years of
expertise**]{.underline} [and many relationships, which makes them an
attractive source of **consultation**]{.underline} [for]{.underline}
administration officials as well as [members of foreign
governments]{.underline}.71 One staffer said that administration
officials have two additional incentives (beyond simply getting
congressional support for a policy) to build strong consultative
relationships with Hill staffers: First, these relationships can help
ensure that a policy retains support after that particular
administration leaves office, since congressional staffers (especially
committee staffers) stay for a long time. Second, relationships on the
Hill expand administration staffers' professional networks for future
job searches. 72

[The point about **durability** is **particularly important** for
NATO]{.underline}, since [allies are **worried** that America may again
elect a president with **Trump**-like views on alliances]{.underline}.
The executive branch will be eager to secure congressional buy-in on its
transatlantic policy to make clear that the policy will not easily be
reversed under future administrations. 73

These findings are consistent with James Curry's research, which finds
that committee leaders and committee staff have become more influential
sources of expertise as the traditional legislative process has
eroded.74 Committee staffers can use their influence and longevity as a
source of influence with the executive branch.

Relationships abroad: Closely related, [members of Congress]{.underline}
and congressional staff [have **strong relationships**]{.underline}
[with representatives of foreign governments]{.underline}. One staffer
argued that congressional relationships with foreign dignitaries are
underused [and]{.underline} that behind-thescenes diplomacy with members
of Congress can have an important impact.75 Foreign dignitaries are
often eager to engage with members of Congress, which is a source of
legislative strength.76 Again, however, there's a balance to be struck,
as interviewees emphasized that the executive branch should retain the
lead in diplomatic negotiations.

Travel: An important part of congressional relationships with foreign
counterparts is travel. Many experts argued that members of Congress can
have a significant impact by traveling to a
**[NATO]{.underline}**-related location and meeting with stakeholders.
77 Lawmakers sometimes travel with congressional delegations (CODELs) to
places like NATO headquarters in Brussels and the Munich Security
Conference. CODELs offer a chance to communicate American priorities to
foreign governments, including wielding threats of punitive action if a
country is seen as not cooperating.78 To be sure, it's difficult to get
members on these trips, in part because traveling to seemingly glamorous
places like Europe may come off to constituents as spending taxpayer
dollars on a luxurious getaway.79 More generally, NATO is low on the
list of places that are worth members' limited time. Still, members
should note that travel offers a way to have a big impact, particularly
on foreign governments.

The fact of the matter is that [if the federal government gets bias
identification and mitigation wrong, it will erode the trust in the
efficacy of autonomous systems]{.underline}, especially among everyday
citizens whose lives are becoming more dependent on them. Below are some
of the use cases in housing, hiring, criminal justice, healthcare,
finance, political disinformation, and facial recognition that are
already raising red flags [due to limited oversight.]{.underline}

[A history of biased and discriminatory laws has reinforced racism in
the criminal justice system, which disproportionately polices and
incarcerates low-income people and people of color]{.underline}. Black
people are incarcerated at five times the rates of white people. And the
introduction of AI in this space has only created an additional
perpetrator of injustices within the system. The PATTERN algorithm,
created by the Department of Justice as part of the First Step Act, was
used to predict recidivism and shorten criminal sentences based on good
behavior. Yet the algorithm has been shown to exhibit biases against
people of color, overpredicting recidivism among minority inmates at
rates of two to eight percent compared to white inmates. Other risk
assessment algorithms have exhibited similar biases, taking for example
the COMPAS algorithm that had been used in the states of New York,
Wisconsin, California, and more. A ProPublica article found that Black
people were twice as likely as white people to be labeled high risk but
not re-offend, while white people were more likely to be labeled as low
risk but then re-offend. [Such risk-assessment tools receive widespread
use across the criminal justice system, from initial sentencing to
determining early releases, exacerbating existing biases within the
system with little oversight]{.underline}

[The U.S. should identify and determine specific use cases for
recommendations of more stringent oversigh]{.underline}t and potential
regulatory actions, including in financial services, healthcare,
employment, and criminal justice.

When contemplating AI risk, it is important to outline and specify which
use cases require stringent oversight and regulatory actions. The NAIAC
could be a vehicle to employ frameworks similar to the EU AI Act,
specifying and classifying use cases with different degrees of risk to
determine appropriate levels of regulation. There are also multiple
agencies working to combat AI biases across different sectors, like the
one previously mentioned at the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission (EEOC). Recently, NIST has also released guidelines on
managing biased AI. [To proceed, there should be an inventory,
assessment, and coordination of red flag areas among government agencies
that prompt discussions on both remedies, and potential enforcements to
directly address higher-risk scenarios that foreclose on equal
opportunities for vulnerable populations.]{.underline}

Beyond these important considerations, [stakeholders in these emerging
technologies must trace back to the roots of the problems, which lie
in]{.underline} the lack of diversity in design teams and data that
continues to carry on trauma and discrimination of the past. By
reviewing the existing civil rights regime[, outlining cases in need of
oversight]{.underline}, encouraging more democratic participation in AI
governance, and incorporating anti-racist principles into every aspect
of the algorithmic design process, it is possible that, with the joint
efforts of tech companies, government institutions, civil rights groups,
and citizens, existing AI biases could be upended. More importantly, the
protections for historically marginalized groups can be better
integrated into national governance, bringing the U.S. closer to the
goals of equal opportunity for all in the digital age.

big tech firms who regularly produce research papers[. If AI can
perpetuate and amplify bias, this emerging technology---an increasingly
powerful tool for state surveillance---cannot be understood to be
separate from the broader social and political context in which it is
situated.]{.underline} In the context of war and the preparation for
war, [the application of AI to military activities should raise even
greater alarm because perpetuating bias in this scenario is lethal to
civilian populations under threat of covert U.S. drone strikes. This
reality must heighten demands for civilian oversight of and
accountability mechanisms for U.S. military operations globally and also
call into question the legal authority by which military operations are
conducted without congressional oversight.]{.underline}

[The troubling implications of AI in military operations is not lost on
AI researchers and professionals, 4,500 of whom have signed on to the
campaign to stop killer robots according to the non-profit organization
AI for Peace. The campaign calls on countries to legislate a ban on AI
weapons through national laws and to create a new international treaty
banning AI weapons and "establish\[ing\] the principle of meaningful
human control over the use of force"; it further calls on all tech
companies and organizations to pledge not to contribute to the
development of AI weapons.]{.underline} Yet, it is equally important to
draw attention to the potential that AI and other types of emerging
technology hold for preventing violence and building peace.
Technological innovations have included the tracking and countering of
hate speech, models helping countries understand and act on COVID's
impact on marginalized communities, and early warning and response
systems with regard to election violence.

The complex landscape of emerging technology in peace and security
reveals a more fundamental truth about institutions of power[. With
incredibly high levels of defense spending and a prioritization of
militarized domestic and international security in the U.S., it follows
that new technology like AI is applied to enhance the nation's capacity
to create war and violence.]{.underline} Put more precisely: If we don't
invest in or plan for peace, then our technological innovations will not
be developed with the goal of managing conflicts without violence and
building peace[. Technology is neutral---AI did not create racial,
ethnic, gender, or other forms of bias---but its application is
not]{.underline}. [Without effort to transform institutions of power or
contend with historical legacies that create inequities, new
technological tools will only amplify and reinforce these problems. When
it comes to military operations, new technology will only become more
dangerous, unregulated, and lethal---and will only continue perpetuating
the racial and ethnic biases present in the wars waged throughout U.S.
history.]{.underline}

[Ongoing revelations show that significant NSA surveillance activities
take place outside of either Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court
(FISC) or congressional oversight, even though these policies directly
impact Americans' privacy. These activities should, at the very least,
be subject to congressional review, since American interests are being
adversely impacted by them]{.underline}.

### 2NC\-\--Oversight Turns Ethical AI

#### AI and Big Data require oversight to be implemented ethically 

**Broeders et al. 17** \[Dennis Broeders is Associate Porfessor of
Security and Technology and Senior Fellow of the Hague Program for Cyber
Norms and the Institute of Security and Global Affairs, Leiden

[The use of Big Data in the security domain **requires** intensified
oversight. An effective and confidence-inspiring oversight
regime]{.underline}, in its turn, [requires a higher degree of data
processing transparency. In this, transparency is not an aim in itself
but serves the interests of accountability. Citizens and organisations
must also have opportunities to discuss the accuracy and proportionality
of decisions based on data analyses]{.underline} and made by government
institutions and, if necessary, to have them assessed by the courts.
13.1. Big Data, big oversight? Current [oversight of data processing
leaves a lot to be desired, even more so in view of the ongoing rapid
digitisation of government and use of data analysis.]{.underline} DPAs
and the various forms of oversight on security and intelligence agencies
do not appear to be properly equipped to face the challenges of the Big
Data era in terms of powers, expertise and financial resources.74 In the
Netherlands, many parties, including the oversight committee CTIVD
itself75, believe that the planned expansion of the powers of the Dutch
general and military intelligence agencies requires oversight capacity
and technical expertise to be significantly expanded at all levels.76
Although the powers and resources of national DPAs will in principle be
increased through the entry into force of the GDPR, it is up to the
national legislatures to allocate the corresponding financial resources,
powers and capacity. As indicated above, oversight of the analysis phase
will be of paramount importance. Therefore, if possibilities for
collecting and analysing data increase, independent oversight should be
strengthened. For regulating the intelligence services, it would be
appropriate, in view of the need to protect fundamental rights, to
introduce an overriding power/the possibility of passing judgments
regarding lawfulness.77 13.2. Increasing (layered) transparency B[ig
Data also requires greater transparency in the government\'s
data-processing activities.]{.underline} There is still a lot to be
gained on this point, as data processing is a 'black box' in many cases.
In addition, data subjects are not so quick to invoke their right to
information because they often simply do not know that their data is
being collected. Given the sensitive nature of the work of law
enforcement and national security agencies, there cannot be full
transparency, which is precluded by the danger of 'gaming the system'
and the need to protect sensitive and classified information.
Nevertheless, it is possible to work with a layered system of
transparency, as was suggested above in relation to reports by the
police and the intelligence services to the competent oversight
authorities, which, in their turn, report to parliament. [It would also
be desirable to give citizens more insight into the frequency of data
collection, the reasons why it is done, and, if possible, what effect
complex data analyses have. In the field of security, some organisations
have the legal right to keep all or parts of their operations secret
from data subjects and the general public]{.underline}. However, the
growing amount of data that the government can obtain under existing
secrecy provisions is out of step with the data processing transparency
that is required. There are indications, moreover, that the [agencies
involved in national security are prone to a culture of
'overclassification']{.underline}.78 Furthermore, [better information
meets a democratic need; a well-informed discussion of the use of Big
Data solutions requires a better understanding of the use of data by
government organisations in the area of security policy]{.underline}.
Therefore, data processing transparency should be enhanced, and a better
balance should be achieved between the secrecy requirement and the
interests of openness as regards Big Data applications that affect
fundamental freedoms. Greater transparency is needed in at least two
areas. A [growing number of organisations in the field of security is
involved in Big Data applications, above all in the area of fighting
fraud]{.underline}. There is a lack of good regulation in this area.
Although a lot of relevant information about data processing in
partnerships is contained in publically available covenants and
decisions, this is not very accessible. [Citizens should not have to be
detectives to find the relevant information.]{.underline} There should
be greater openness when organisations intend to work with Big Data
applications, for example, by requiring them to draw up a policy plan
detailing what Big Data applications they use, what public policy they
pursue, at what cost and what results they expect from the application.
[At the accountability level, too, more is possible than is currently
being done, for example in annual reporting]{.underline}. Compared to
the Netherlands, some European countries are practising a significantly
higher degree of openness about their intelligence techniques and
operations, without this hindering the work of their intelligence
services in any noteworthy way. This is being done in Belgium, for
example, with the aim of being able to conduct an informed discussion
about how the intelligence and security services work, what their powers
are and how they are monitored and regulated.79

Cybersecurity remains perhaps the greatest challenge to the economic and
physical well being of governments, individuals, and businesses
worldwide. During recent months the United States has witnessed many
disruptive and expensive cyber breaches. No single U.S. governmental
agency or congressional committee maintains primary responsibility for
the numerous issues related to cybersecurity. [**Good** oversight stands
at the **core** of **good government**]{.underline}. [Oversight is
Congress's way of **making sure** that the administration is carrying
out federal law in the way **Congress intended**]{.underline}. So many
aspects of cybersecurity have the potential for use by: terrorists; by
foreign entities as a tool to conduct industrial espionage against U.S.
business; and by nation state adversaries, or others intent upon
creating serious disruption. [These various threats mean that
**cybersecurity policy** in many ways must be treated just like the

#### Oversight ensures intel is used democratically

<https://doi.org/10.1080/02684521003588104>; Lowell- ES\]

Despite the difficulty involved, however, something must be done. The
last seven years have shown that intelligence is more crucial than ever
to national security, [but as the executive branch and the intelligence
community try to maximize the utility of intelligence in meeting
national security needs, it is imperative that the congressional
overseers meet their obligations as well]{.underline}. The importance of
legislative oversight of the executive branch in general has long been
recognized. 'Quite as important as legislation', noted Woodrow Wilson,
'is vigilant oversight of administration'.3 **[In the intelligence
arena, however, congressional oversight is at an added
premium.]{.underline}** The first, most obvious reason is the inherent
secrecy of the subject. In other areas, such as the environment or
banking, the media plays a valuable role in helping Congress monitor the
actions of the federal government on behalf of the public**[. In the
largely classified world of intelligence, in all but a few exceptional
cases, the media is effectively precluded from playing that supporting
role, thus enhancing the importance of legislative
oversight.]{.underline}**

A second less recognized but equally important reason that oversight is
so critical to the intelligence enterprise is that, because ' . . . the
intelligence community is constrained in its ability to convince the
American public that it can be trusted and deserves their support',
[Congress also plays an important role in explaining and representing
the intelligence community to the public]{.underline}.4

**[A third reason legislative oversight is so important is that, done
well, it helps to improve the intelligence product,]{.underline}**
whether that means collection, analysis or covert action. **[When
administration and intelligence officials know that they will have to
explain a funding choice or particular operation to Congress, it has the
effect of adding a layer to their own internal vetting]{.underline}**.
This article explains the major problems with the congressional
oversight system, analyzes why it is so hard to reform, and examines
what constructive steps might be taken to improve the situation.

We need to ensure that this Panel\'s work does not become yet another
undertaking by experts whose recommendations go unanswered.
[**Congressional oversight is key** to ensuring that Federal departments
and agencies are meeting their mandates and doing so in an **effective
and efficient** way.]{.underline} And therefore, I urge the committee to
follow through on the Panel\'s recommendations by holding not just this
session, but a series of hearings to assess the Nation\'s ability to
prepare for and respond to biological threats. I would like to thank our
panelists once again for coming and sharing their expertise. I look
forward to hearing from each of you about what our Nation can do to
improve our biodefense network. Thirdly, there is a major revolution in
our understanding of how the biological world works and our ability to
manipulate it. [The advances in bioscience and biotechnologies should be
part of the foundation of U.S. biodefense against both natural and
deliberate epidemics. These advances are going to be extremely
beneficial to humankind across many different fields that go beyond
biomedicine. But it also means that we now have created a world in which
there is wide access to advanced biological knowledge and the materials
needed to build and disseminate biological weapons.]{.underline} As the
Defense Science Board said in 2001, an age ago in terms of scientific
advances, [there are no technical barriers to nonstate actors, including
terrorist groups and lone wolves, carrying out **devastating
bioattacks** that could kill millions and cost billions. But these
advances in science and in biotechnology also, for the first time, give
us powerful tools that could allow us to prevent and to rapidly detect
and quench epidemics, whatever their cause. And I\'m going to give you
some examples of critical technologies which might help realize the
Panel\'s assertion that innovation is a key ingredient and that dramatic
improvements in biodefense are within reach]{.underline}. First of all,
the potential destructive power of biological weapons is akin to that of
nuclear weapons. In 1993, the Congressional Office of Technology
Assessment estimated that a kilogram of aerosolized anthrax dropped on
Washington, DC, in ideal weather conditions would result in 1 to 3
million deaths. That\'s about the same toll as a 1-megaton hydrogen
bomb. These statements are not based on speculation, but on decades of
development and field testing by the U.S. military during the Offensive
Biological Weapons program of the United States, which was ended by
President Nixon in 1969. We also know that the USSR had a massive secret
offensive BW program created after they signed the Biological Weapons
Convention in 1972. These were both ambitious, and at least in the case
of the U.S., highly successful programs. During the cold war, the U.S.
field tested many different bioweapons in realistic conditions,
including releases from air, boats, ships, and subways. Declassified
U.S. documents from the \'60s clearly recognized the strategic power of
bioweapons. We do not now know the fate of the Soviet effort. In the
half-century since the U.S. ended its Offensive BW program, there has
been a revolution in bioscience. Advances in many fields, including
pharmacology and aerosol biological, and our ability to read, write, and
edit DNA, the code of life, have resulted in tremendous beneficial
achievements. [But these **advances hav**e also **meant the** **global
spread of bioknowledge** and access to sophisticated biotechnologies.
The materials and know-how needed to build a bioweapon have many
legitimate uses. These are dual-use technologies, and as the chairman
said, this makes the task of collecting intelligence about covert
bioweapons programs exceedingly difficult. We are going to see an
increase in the tempo of naturally occurring epidemics, which we can
talk about in the discussion. I want to end by saying that there are two
critical technologies that have not gotten sufficient attention in our
biodefense program. The first is rapid diagnostics, upon which we\'ve
spent very little money and for which there is a very big market problem
that makes it difficult for private companies to pursue
diagnostics]{.underline}. And the second is vaccines.

An [adequate oversight]{.underline} system [must,]{.underline} at a
minimum, [be able to assess **potential risks** from a technology,
minimize the chances that the risk will occur and maintain surveillance
to identify risks that do occur]{.underline}. It should perform these
functions while minimizing adverse impacts on technological innovation
or market functions and while giving the public confidence that the
system is effective and that it allows public opinion to be heard. The
starting point for any oversight system is the ability to identify the
risks that a technology may pose and to assess the likelihood and the
magnitude of such risks. Such an assessment requires both general
scientific knowledge and data about each specific technology and
product. [The relationship between science and data is complex. Without
an adequate scientific framework there is no way to know what data to
collect.]{.underline} For example, which aspects of a nanomaterial are
most relevant in determining its toxicity? As noted above, more than a
dozen characteristics have been suggested even for relatively simple
nanomaterials. What will be needed in addition with more complex active
nanotechnologies[? Without better scientific knowledge we do not know
what data to collect and examine]{.underline}. On the other hand,
progress in developing the necessary scientific knowledge often depends
on having a lot of data on specific materials. [Only by having such data
can we develop and test the needed scientific hypotheses. Oversight
cannot directly improve scientific knowledge. It can, however, make
clear the need for such knowledge, frame the questions that need to be
answered and, through requirements imposed on manufacturers, generate
the data needed by scientists.]{.underline} How to apply adequate
oversight when the state of scientific knowledge is not adequate is one
of the basic dilemmas in developing and applying 21st-century oversight
mechanisms. In most cases, the science related to risk will be primitive
and uncertain, but the potential risks will be serious enough so that
lack of oversight will not be an acceptable option. Once information
about the potential risks of a new material or product has been
obtained, an adequate [oversight]{.underline} system [must be able to
impose requirements that prevent adverse effects from occurring or at
least minimize the risks from the new product]{.underline}. This can be
done in a variety of ways. [Restrictions may be put on the product as a
condition for allowing it to be marketed. Standards may be established
to prevent worker or environmental exposure while the product is being
manufactured, transported, stored, used or disposed of]{.underline}.
Restrictions or requirements may be imposed on the product after it has
been marketed, or the manufacturer may be required to withdraw the
product from the market altogether. Additional steps can be taken to
encourage green design and pollution prevention. [Because of the
complexity of new technologies and the rapid pace of invention and
adoption, the science will probably be inadequate to fully identify all
the risks a new material or product will pose. For this reason, even
more than in the past, it will be necessary to establish requirements
and systems for identifying adverse effects of a product after it is in
commercial use]{.underline}. A high degree of international cooperation
will be necessary for such systems to work effectively. These [oversight
requirements should be applied]{.underline} with a constant awareness of
the need to encourage technological innovation and economic growth. The
"cowboy ideology" that views regulation as antithetical to free markets
has proven to be false in sector after sector. [Productive markets
require effective regulation. However, there is an undeniable tension
between the two. It is unlikely that government agencies will improve
their efficiency, speed and expertise sufficiently to keep pace with
technological innovation.]{.underline} To avoid setting up large
obstacles to that innovation, oversight mechanisms will have to rely
more on manufacturers to assess and control risks. At the same time,
[oversight]{.underline} will have to be structured to [assure that
manufacturers know what information is needed, collect the information
in a reliable way and do not abuse their responsibility.]{.underline}

#### Only way to promote public trust

**Pauwels 13** \[Eleonore Pauwels is a research scholar with the

Program at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, in
Washington, DC.
https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/63/2/79/534322?login=true\]//LP

The respondents expressed a strong appetite for more information about
synthetic biology[. There was a broad consensus that "more should be
done to inform the American public" about]{.underline} synthetic biology
[research.]{.underline} In Hart Research Associates (2009), [9 in 10 of
the respondents agreed with this statement, including 73% who strongly
agreed. The participants also approached synthetic biology with a sense
of tentative support and guarded optimism]{.underline}. Although most
did not want to stand in the way of this research, [they also did not
want to let it proceed without government oversight]{.underline}. In
Hart Research Associates (2010), the large majority of the respondents
believed that rather than synthetic biology being banned, research and
development should move forward with a focus on uncovering possible
effects on humans and the environment (63%). Only one in three (33%)
respondents supported a ban on synthetic biology research until its
implications and risks could be better understood (figure 5). The
majority of the participants also felt that when it comes to synthetic
biology research, [voluntary guidelines do not provide adequate
oversight.]{.underline} More than half (52%) of them thought that
synthetic biology should be regulated by the federal government, whereas
36% thought that voluntary guidelines developed jointly by industry and
government could provide adequate oversight (figure 6). nce again, the
focus group data contributed nuanced insights into what the participants
saw as the best approaches to managing the risks associated with
synthetic biology and what they saw as possible ways of increasing
public trust. Here is a comment from a participant: I feel \[that
federal regulation\] is the best approach, because I don\'t agree with
banning \[synthetic biology\]. Technology should advance, and in order
to advance... there\'s risks with it. Anything that we have today comes
at a risk, but... I think of the four \[options provided\], the federal
government would be the best. And I guess it would be more in the
spotlight than just some private company and its investors. He continued
his explanation by referring to the broad principle of political
accountability: "[At least..., technically, we choose the government, so
if they screw up, we can vote them out of office. And with all of the
people on television discussing everything, it\'s probably harder for
the government to whitewash an issue as opposed to a private
company."]{.underline} After having discussed with the participants the
best approach to managing the risks associated with synthetic biology,
the focus groups\' moderator asked questions concerning the ways in
which the federal government could work to increase public trust. The
concern over the competence of government agencies to regulate synthetic
biology brought forward many suggestions that scientists or research
institutions needed to participate in oversight along with the
regulatory agencies. One of the participants expressed her reason for
involving scientists in the regulatory process: "I think \[that\] they
should be part of the team, because they bring so much knowledge and
understanding." In general, keeping regulation above the political fray
by involving scientific experts was important for the participants. The
participants also spoke about enacting a hybrid approach---a kind of
private--public partnership that would lead to a better system of checks
and balances. As was mentioned by one of the participants, "[I guess I
would feel more comfortable if there was a system of checks and
balances... like the government. Not that that\'s my first choice, but
it seems like it\'s the only independent option for checking---a system
of checks and balances."]{.underline} Another participant went even
further: "So, we\'re going to have to set up, I believe, a total new
framework of so-called 'commissions and oversights.'" Another
participant mentioned the idea of having a third-party overseeing the
industry activity: "Regulation \[should include\] a third party, an
unrelated organization, \[to\] watch over the industry. And that\'s why
we have them, because they have no interest. They are not connected.
They are not getting any profit. They are there to certify or check,
independent of those who are making the money." This idea of a system of
checks and balances seemed to be the best way of securing accountability
and providing the public with information about the research
applications[: "The knowledge that should something go wrong, there will
be repercussions---the checks and balances thing---just so long as if
anything goes wrong, someone will be held accountable. They won\'t be
just buying their way out of it. There will be a nice little way to
know."]{.underline} In a nutshell, [what these quantitative and
qualitative data tell us is that public perceptions]{.underline} toward
synthetic biology [are ambivalent: If there is no trace of candid
optimism, there is also no unilateral technology rejection]{.underline}.
The survey respondents and focus group participants showed enthusiasm
for synthetic biology applications when those applications were
developed to address societal, medical, and sustainability needs.
Tinkering with the DNA of existing or newly designed organisms was seen
as a potential concern if this research were to be done without
sufficiently funded investigations of its potential risks and long-term
implications for humans and the environment. In general, the
participants also remained quite skeptical about futuristic
technological visions based on hype or technoscientific promises; they
supported an allocation of funding for research that would lead to
applications that actually meet social and sustainability goals[. When
it comes to oversight, their priorities were to promote transparency and
accountability and to ensure a form of tailored governance in which
expertise is accompanied by independent checks and balances and in which
diverse knowledge sources might help deal with the uncertainty
surrounding a new technology.]{.underline}

President Donald Trump increasingly acts as though he believes he can
ignore Congress and set wide-ranging national policies on his own. He
has, for instance, recently taken unilateral steps to cut off foreign
aid to countries he says are sending too many migrants to the United
States. He wants to redirect some of the Pentagon's budget to building
the border wall that Congress rejected. His administration has separated
families at the border, rolled back student loan protections and energy
efficiency standards, and reportedly blocked AT&T Inc.'s US\$85 billion
acquisition of Time Warner. Congress has responded by scheduling
hearings and requesting documents from the administration. So far, Trump
has largely dismissed this congressional oversight as "presidential
harassment" and attempted to resist by claiming executive privilege
exempts him from oversight. In his State of the Union address, Trump
went so far as to say that "if there is going to be peace and
legislation, there cannot be war and investigation." As a constitutional
law scholar, I'm certain that the answer to who wins this fight is
clear. [Presidential power to override Congress is limited to a very
small set of circumstances.]{.underline} As for everything else, [the
Constitution empowers Congress to set the nation's course and keep it on
track through oversight. Congress can eliminate almost every federal
agency in the country or, instead, redirect agencies' efforts toward
building homes for the poor and require daily reports on progress toward
that goal.]{.underline} As long as the votes are there in Congress to
pursue a course of action, presidents can't do much about it. Carrying
out laws [Oversight allows Congress to ensure the executive is properly
carrying out the laws as Congress intends. The Brookings
Institution]{.underline}, a centrist think tank, [has created a new
"oversight tracker," which shows that Congress is doing this across a
wide range of issues and agencies: energy, education, immigration,
commerce, civil rights, rule of law, ethics and more. Congress is asking
the administration important policy questions. Are adequate rules,
resources and incentives in place to reunite families who have been
separated at the border? Are the nation's anti-trust laws being used to
achieve political rather than legal ends? Are student loan providers
being held accountable for their failure to treat students fairly? Why
have energy efficiency improvements slowed down or
reversed?]{.underline} [All federal agencies, commissions and offices
that presidents direct were created by Congress. Congress has created
more and more federal agencies over time, and increased the scope of the
executive branch's authority. But the power of individual presidents
remains constitutionally limited to the powers that Congress gives
them.]{.underline} The important lesson for today is that [the vast
majority of federal power lies in the hands of legislators, not
presidents.]{.underline} Save the most central functions of the
executive -- law enforcement, managing the Treasury, foreign affairs and
the military -- [presidents only have the power and agencies that
Congress gives them.]{.underline} Holding agencies accountable No matter
how much power Congress bestows upon presidents and agencies, that
[power is constrained by the continuing and final checks the
Constitution gives Congress.]{.underline} Presidents may nominate agency
heads, ambassadors and federal judges at their discretion, but senators
confirm or reject them. Equally important, the president's
constitutional power to make those appointments only covers high-ranking
officials. [Congress can, on a case-by-case basis, choose who will
appoint inferior officers and limit the president's ability to remove
them]{.underline}. For instance, to address ethical breaches by the
executive branch following Watergate, Congress passed legislation
establishing an independent counsel, an official which a special court
rather than the president or attorney general would appoint for the sake
of impartiality. [Congress also sets all the agencies' budgets on an
annual basis and dictates how they will spend their
budgets.]{.underline} In short, **[lawmakers wield enormous authority
over the presidency]{.underline}** and they may ask for almost anything
they want. The people can fire Congress every two years, but they rely
on their representatives to hold the White House accountable all the
time. [Americans need Congress to make sure **presidents and their
staff** are enforcing the law in ways that meet the public's
needs]{.underline}. Ultimately, the executive branch -- like Congress --
works for the people, not presidents.

[That this executive overreach in military operations has empowered so
many human rights abuses is both disturbing on its own and disturbing in
the precedent it creates for this over-extended power to potentially be
applied further]{.underline}. National security reporter Spencer
Ackerman argues that Trump using the War on Terror apparatus against
domestic protesters during the protests for George Floyd is "allowing
the war on terror to be its most authentic self"---in other words, that
**[the executive powers the president has gained via militaristic
executive overreach are always at risk of being applied
domestically]{.underline}**, and not globally.41 He stated in an
interview with Vox, "We might perhaps better appreciate it when
remembering that in the summer of 2020, the Trump administration
maneuvered a lot of the mechanisms of the war on terror against its
domestic opponents. There's going to be another rightwing
administration. It will probably look more like Trump's than not. It may
be more competent, and it may be bolder, and it will have a precedent
blessed by Obama's Justice Department that says if it's too hard to kill
people, you declare to be dangerous terrorists, just \... sorry."

This danger that Ackerman points out is clear. Burns points out that the
extent of executive overreach in military matters means that "we have
started to rely on the virtue of the officeholder significantly more
than relying on the system that keeps all members of government
accountable." This is not a sustainable or healthy situation for the
U.S. to be in. [Years and years of executive overreaches have created
dangerous precedents that presidents can fall back on to justify further
overreaches and further over-extend executive powers.]{.underline}

In exceptional situations of disaster and crisis, [the executive
government tends to take a pre-eminent role in managing emergencies and
threats to the]{.underline} nation, while the other branches of
government, Parliament and the courts, tend to relinquish their robust
scrutiny roles, leading to a 'government by decree'.220 [This tendency,
coupled with a 'sophisticated bureaucratic and regulatory state ... with
the capacity to observe, police and regulate its citizens', 221
generates great risks for individual rights and liberties]{.underline}.
As we are faced with the largest worldwide public health crisis for a
century, it is timely to consider what lessons can be gleaned from
adopting a long-run historical perspective to major crises involving
emergency powers such as wars and pandemics. [In times of war, it can be
observed that temporary coercive measures have become permanent, or
reincarnated in similar forms in other legislation]{.underline}. The
external wars with defined boundaries have been reimagined as internal
amorphous threats in the form of the 'War on Terror', [justifying the
continuation of broad-ranging executive powers beyond a clearly defined
emergency period. These sweeping executive powers have then been
strategically deployed by successive governments for unintended
purposes: to attack dissidents, protestors, journalists and
whistle-blowers.]{.underline} The Second World War has also been used to
successfully wrest financial power from the States to the Commonwealth,
paving the way to an enduring vertical fiscal imbalance where the States
are now permanently beholden to the Commonwealth for the funding of
their programmes and policies. Yet [wars can be distinguished from
pandemics, as national security concerns create a centralising force,
where there is a need for a uniform approach and secrecy in the
governmental approach, which needs to be concealed from the enemy. In
such crises, the 'national-level executive branch will have access to
unique information in the form of intelligence resources and capability
assessments'.]{.underline}222 On the other hand, we argue that pandemics
create a centrifugal or decentralising force, as information needs to be
deployed to the whole of the community, and subnational governments tend
to play a strong role in health-care provision. Thus, pandemic
regulation requires intergovernmental coordination and cooperation
between the Commonwealth and the States, as administration of quarantine
is 'intimately entwined with the state government functions of public
health, policing, customs, harbours and marine and government health
officers'.223 On that basis, Ginsburg and Versteeg have contended that
in crises such as a pandemic -- in which information is dispersed, the
crisis is slow-moving, and local governments are needed to implement the
crisis response -- [the executive should be **structurally** more bound,
i.e. subject to legal]{.underline} and parliamentary [checks and
balances, than in national security crises.2]{.underline}24 Yet
Australia's modern approach to pandemic regulation displays strong
centralising features. From the fledgling federalist efforts during the
1918 Spanish Flu that failed spectacularly, the Commonwealth government
has through fiscal dominance and strengthened national federalist
arrangements managed to solidify its powers in terms of managing risks
of infectious diseases in Australia. This centralisation is exhibited in
the information-gathering processes in COVID-19. While Ginsburg and
Versteeg contend that there should be decentralisation of
information-gathering processes in a pandemic, as valuable information
is dispersed amongst public and private actors such as universities,
pharmaceutical companies and healthcare providers as to the best health
response,225 this has not been the case in Australia. Rather, in
Australia, information has been centralised in the form of the Chief
Medical Officer in the Commonwealth and States -- a medical technocratic
response to crisis governance.226 Although it is reasonable in a public
health crisis for politicians to defer to medical experts, reliance on
such advice needs to be supplemented with greater procedural and
legislative safeguards to prevent abuse.227 Further, this [technocratic
approach may have flow-on effects]{.underline} on the way that
Australian courts and legislatures may see their role. For instance,
Ginsburg and Versteeg's empirical study of 106 countries has shown that
Australia was in a small minority of democratic countries worldwide
'where the legislature, courts and subnational units have not (yet)
exercised active oversight' during COVID-19,228 [whereas in 82% of
countries, there was either legislative involvement, judicial
enforcement, or resistance from subnational units.]{.underline} Thus,
Australian legislatures and judiciaries have been remarkably acquiescent
to the executive government in COVID-19 compared to other democracies
worldwide. [In terms of individual rights and liberties, a distinction
can be made between individual versus population-wide coercive measures.
While far-reaching population-wide restrictions tend to be rolled back
by governments as soon as possible, as it is not tenable to maintain
widespread restrictions on the freedom of association and movement for
the whole populace for an extended period, the coercive individual
biosecurity measures pose a fundamental threat to individual rights and
freedoms. The permissive legislative regime for individual coercive
measures that allows biosecurity officials to subject individuals to
executive detention and invasive bodily treatments therefore present a
significant risk of misuse.]{.underline} There have been cases in
Australia and overseas where the power of quarantine has been used by
governments for reasons beyond genuine public health concerns, e.g. to
target and segregate certain races or vulnerable groups.229 As Mariner,
Annas and Parmet observe: 'Measures like quarantine, surveillance, and
behavior control have historically been targeted at people who are
already disadvantaged, those on the margins of society, especially
immigrants, the poor, and people of color'. 230 For instance, [entire
ethnic groups were quarantined]{.underline} during the Sydney
plagues.231 More recently, in the handling of COVID-19 in Australia,
concerns were raised that the hard-line housing commission tower
lockdown in Melbourne,232 which confined 3,000 vulnerable individuals to
their rooms for 14 days, enforced by a battalion of police that stormed
into the housing commission towers immediately during the government
announcement. This was seen to be a heavy-handed approach that directly
targeted a vulnerable lower socio-economic group, while equivalent
outbreaks in affluent areas were not treated in the same way.233 In late
2020, the Victorian Ombudsman found that this 'hard lockdown' imposed on
residents at the Melbourne public housing tower was in breach of the
human rights of those residents, including the right to humane treatment
when deprived of liberty.234

A strong U.S. military rests upon broad, bipartisan support among the
American people translated through their representatives in Congress.
Yet, amid the onset of great power competition and a generational
conflict against jihadis, **[[the Pentagon's atrophied outreach to
Congress]{.underline}]{.mark}** has undermined support for the U.S.
military. Although the Pentagon's "[Year Without a
Briefing](https://thehill.com/policy/defense/446363-pentagon-reaches-one-year-without-on-camera-briefing-from-top-spokesperson)"
has rightly garnered a great deal of attention, the American public
isn't the only audience getting the cold shoulder from the Department of
Defense. [**The Pentagon has failed to treat Congress as a partner in
executing America's defense strategy. In explanations both of budget
choices and policy decisions, senior [defense leaders have repeatedly
neglected to invest in]{.mark} [relationship building with Capitol Hill
or to provide sufficient information to lawmakers]{.mark} and senior

Congress believes it hasn't received sufficient answers to its oversight

outcomes, refuses to share adequate information with Congress, hoping
that such information can be kept secret, or that congressional
complaints will blow over in time. If nothing else, the
[[silence]{.underline}]{.mark} emanating from the building [[engenders
mistrust and cynicism about the choices the military
makes]{.underline}]{.mark}. Clearly, Congress understands that some of
these strategic messaging and outreach snafus stem from the White House.
In particular, anemic information flow about the president's decision to

Budget's abuse of the overseas contingency operations account cannot be
laid at the Pentagon's feet. But [[Capitol Hill has proven much less
forgiving of the Pentagon's failures of communication and lack of
outreach]{.underline}]{.mark}. The department
[struggled](https://warontherocks.com/2019/05/hard-choices-and-strategic-insolvency-where-the-national-defense-strategy-falls-short/)
even to provide a basic account of how the 2020 military budget request

severe bipartisan displeasure over the Pentagon's lack of documentation
and insufficient justifications for important acquisition decisions. In
early March, Congress learned of the plan to decommission the aircraft
carrier Harry S. Truman from the press, and the rationale behind the
decision remained opaque for weeks.

While sharp differences arise in some foreign policy areas, [the
subcommittee plans to focus on how to make U.S. diplomatic and
development efforts more efficient and effective today and in the
future]{.underline}, said Bera, a California Democrat who chairs the
panel. He and Zeldin, the panel's ranking Republican, appeared last week
at USIP as part of the Institute's Bipartisan Congressional Dialogue,
which brings together leaders from both political parties to address
urgent national security and foreign policy challenges.

"We would like to take a deep dive into the vacancies and their causes
at State and USAID that even precede this administration," Bera said,
ticking off areas of concern. "How can we make sure they have the tools
to do their job in the most effective way? How do we modernize these
organizations? We are losing the next generation of senior development
and diplomatic leadership. How do we retain them?"

Zeldin, who represents a district on New York's Long Island, called
**[oversight a critical congressional function that does not imply a
clash between lawmakers and the executive branch.]{.underline}**

"**[We want to know whether appropriated funds are being spent as
intended and congressional intent is followed in execution of a
law"]{.underline}** he said. "It's important to see if agencies are
communicating well with each other."

Bipartisan Consensus

While some of the stark differences in policy are often focused on by
the media**[, there is a wide bipartisan consensus on many foreign
policy issues,]{.underline}** Bera said. He cited as an example a recent
hearing on Central America's Northern Triangle, the area comprised of
Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador and the source of most migrants
seeking entry to the U.S. While there is clearly a "challenge on the
border," he said, both sides recognize American policy has to address
the root causes of the immigration issue. Consensus on that part of the
immigration question unfortunately receives little public notice, he
said.

"If you marked up 15 bills, the most controversial will get the media
attention," Zeldin said. "If there's no controversy, none will get
attention and you won't know it took place."

Both lawmakers stressed that a long-term, consistent foreign policy is
critical to advancing U.S. interests around the world. Asked by USIP
President Nancy Lindborg, who moderated the conversation, about the
extended horizon needed to strengthen fragile states that are often the
breeding ground of extremism, Bera said that as a physician, practicing
prevention was for him essentially second nature.

"[That is the reason bipartisanship is so important to me," he said. "We
are going to have Democratic presidents and Republican
presidents]{.underline}. What you're talking about cannot be
accomplished in a four or eight-year term."

Congressional oversight of foreign policy hasn't always been this way. A
far cry from today's marginalized and demoralized bodies, Congress'
foreign affairs committees once stood side-by-side with the presidency
at the center of America's foreign policymaking. [One need only look at
Henry Cabot Lodge's famous campaign leading to the Senate's 1919
rejection of the Treaty of Versailles and the League of Nations, on the
grounds that the Senate had not been adequately consulted, to see the
**impact of aggressive congressional oversight of foreign policy**. Or
consider the]{.underline} heady era of the [mid-20th century, when
Congress faced a new international landscape shaped by **two world
wars** and the emergence of the Cold War and **mutually assured
destruction**. Far from shrinking from these responsibilities, Congress
undertook a **historic effort** to write --- and then re-write --- the
rules of the road for foreign policy. In 1951, lawmakers replaced the
Marshall Plan with the Mutual Security Act, then overtook that
legislation ten years later with the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961,
which remains the foundational statute governing U.S. aid overseas.
Congress enacted the War Powers Act in 1973 and, in 1976, passed the
landmark Arms Export Control Act.]{.underline} As [congressional
oversight of foreign policy gained strength during the Vietnam
War]{.underline}, scholar Linda Fowler notes that "[the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee was at the **vanguard** of the resurgence of
Congress in international affairs," citing the panel's establishment of
a special investigative subcommittee to examine executive branch foreign
policies]{.underline}. That subcommittee, chaired by Sen. Stewart
Symington, identified a range of executive branch abuses, uncovered
expansive military operations whose existence or scope had been
previously undisclosed, and paved the way for the Church Committee and,
ultimately, establishment of the Senate Select Committee on
Intelligence. It also defined for Congress a role of comprehensive,
sustained oversight of U.S. foreign activities, presence, and
commitments. These debates were messy, complex, and occasionally
partisan, but the results were substantial. However, the 1980s and 90s
saw the beginning of a dramatic decline in congressional engagement ---
and effectiveness --- in conducting foreign policy oversight. Fowler's
work documents the decrease in oversight hearings conducted by both the
Foreign Relations and Armed Services Committees in the Senate, beginning
in the 1990s. Likewise, Congress' ability to enact legislation setting
out the priorities, expectations, and authorities of the State
Department crumbled. This final installment in a three-part series (part
I addressed defense oversight and part II examined intelligence) about
congressional national security oversight argues regular State
Department authorization bills --- and their focus on bureaucratic and
programmatic management --- are essential to effective oversight. And
[effective oversight in this arena has **never been more urgently
needed**]{.underline}: Draconian cuts to both State and the U.S. Agency
for International Development proposed in the Trump administration's
2018 and 2019 budgets present America's foreign policy establishment
with a colossal crisis. Regardless of the outcome of November's mid-term
elections, both the House and Senate foreign affairs committees will see
new leadership. These new leaders will have an opportunity to set their
committees on a path to reestablish their place at the center of foreign
policymaking. Doing so will require a smart strategy for regaining the
committees' capacity to legislate, a renewed focus on structural and
management issues impacting the foreign policy enterprise, investment in
the committees' own oversight capacity, and attention to long-simmering
cross-committee jurisdictional challenges. [Oversight is a **profound
responsibility**, deeply embedded in the Constitution's grant of powers
to the Legislative Branch. Effective oversight means a serious,
objective, and persistent examination of whether the Executive Branch is
making use of the taxpayer resources entrusted to it in ways that are
effective, efficient, accountable, and in accordance with law and
congressional direction]{.underline}. It also means --- critically, in
this era of increasingly sophisticated threats and responses --- helping
to educate the public. To achieve both goals, it must be conducted with
balance, bipartisanship, and restraint against tendencies to pursue
political vendettas.

[Even]{.underline} with the War Powers Act written into law, [the
president and Congress have been at odd]{.underline}s in regards to the
proper division of war powers post-1973. U.S. presidents have
consistently said that the War Powers Act is an unconstitutional
infringement on the executive branch's powers. [President Reagan used
the military without congressional authorization in Grenada. President
George H.W. Bush did get authorization for the first Gulf War but
asserted that he did not need permission from Congress to go to
war]{.underline}. The use of military force over the decades has cost
Americans and humanity at large millions of lives and trillions of
dollars. [Constitutional scholars have argued that Bush's 1989 invasion
of Panama did not comply with the requirements under the War Powers
Act]{.underline} and was not authorized by Congress, in accordance with
Article I of the Constitution. Similarly, in 1998 President Clinton sent
troops to Kosovo to conduct an extensive air campaign without
Congressional authorization. [One week after the attacks on September
11, 2001, Congress passed an Authorization for the Use of Military Force
(AUMF) against the "nations, organizations, or persons" who planned,
aided, or committed the attacks, as well as anyone who harbored those
nations, organizations or persons. This law paved the way for President
George W. Bush and the three subsequent presidents to send U.S. forces
not only to Afghanistan but also to Pakistan, Somalia, Syria, Yemen, and
other nations as part of the War on Terror.]{.underline} After more than
two decades, the terror threats to the United States and its allies look
very different from those at the time of the attacks on September 11.
According to the Department of Homeland Security, the vast majority of
attempted terrorist attacks since 2011 have emanated from domestic
groups rather than foreign ones. [The 2001 AUMF has been used as grounds
for the use of military force against groups like the Islamic State of
Iraq and Syria (ISIS), Al Qaeda, and Al Shabaab, despite the fact that
these groups were formed many years after the attacks on September
11]{.underline}. Many in Congress now support a sunset of the 2001 "War
on Terror" AUMF and a repeal of the 2002 AUMF that authorized the war in
Iraq. But while expressing the desire to repeal and replace these laws
and end endless wars, the Biden administration has not articulated a
coherent strategy that would actually do so. [The use of military force
--both authorized and unauthorized -- over the decades has cost
Americans and humanity at large millions of lives and trillions of
dollars]{.underline}. It has also contributed to the destabilization of
multiple countries, an expanding refugee crisis, accelerating climate
devastation, and the rise of new terror groups, all of which have made
the United States and people around the globe less secure.

PARADISE LOST

[Evidence of the decline in civilian control over the military **isn't
hard** to find]{.underline}. Over the last few decades, senior [military
leaders]{.underline} have [regularly **thwart**]{.underline}ed [or
**delay**]{.underline}ed [presidential decisions]{.underline} on
military policy. In 1993, Colin Powell, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, helped block President Bill Clinton from ending the policy
that banned gays from the military, resulting in the now defunct "don't
ask, don't tell" compromise. Both President Barack [**Obama** and
**Trump** complained]{.underline} that [officers **boxed them
in**]{.underline}---[limiting military options]{.underline} and leaking
information---[and forced them to]{.underline} grudgingly [accept
**troop surges**]{.underline} they did not support. Obama's generals
signaled that they would accept nothing less than an aggressive
counterinsurgency in Afghanistan---despite White House opposition. Obama
later fired Stanley McChrystal, then commander of U.S. forces in
Afghanistan, after members of the general's staff disparaged White House
officials in remarks to a reporter. Trump, for his part, saw senior
[military leaders push back against]{.underline} his [orders to withdraw
troops]{.underline} from Afghanistan and Syria. Although these moves
were signature campaign promises, Trump eventually backed off when
military leaders told him they couldn't be done and that the policies
would harm national security.

Of course, senior military leaders do not always get everything they
want, but they often get more than they should. Their power also extends
beyond headline-grabbing decisions about overseas deployments or troop
reductions. [The military's influence manifests hundreds of times a day
through **bureaucratic maneuvers**]{.underline} inside the Pentagon, in
policy discussions in the White House, and during testimony on Capitol
Hill. [These mundane interactions]{.underline}, perhaps more than
anything else, [**steer decision-making** away from
civilians]{.underline} in the Office of the Secretary of Defense and
toward uniformed personnel. Inside the Pentagon, for instance, military
leaders often preempt the advice and analysis of civilian staff by
sending their proposals straight to the secretary of defense, bypassing
the byzantine clearance process that non-uniformed staffers must
navigate.

There are signs of the erosion of civilian control outside the Pentagon,
as well. [Congress]{.underline} too [**rarely demands** that the
military bow to civilian authority, instead weighing in **selectively**
and for **partisan** reasons]{.underline}. During the Obama
administration, for example, some commentators and at least one member
of Congress suggested that Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, should resign in protest over the president's
management of the campaign to defeat the Islamic State, also known as
ISIS. The goal was to use Dempsey's role as the president's chief
military adviser as leverage in a partisan battle over Obama's foreign
policy. Under Trump, many Democrats cheered on the retired and
active-duty generals who pushed back against the president's decisions.
These "adults in the room" included James Mattis (the secretary of
defense), John Kelly (the secretary of homeland security and then White
House chief of staff), and H. R. McMaster (Trump's national security
adviser). At the extreme, some of Trump's opponents even urged senior
military leaders to contemplate removing Trump from office. In August
2020, two well-known retired army officers, John Nagl and Paul Yingling,
penned an open letter to Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, telling him to do just that if the president refused to leave
office after losing the 2020 election. Although these efforts may have
comforted those concerned about Trump's erratic policies, they
undermined civilian control by suggesting that it was the military's job
to keep the executive in check. When politicians endorse military
insubordination that serves their interests, they do long-term damage to
the principle of civilian primacy.

[Oversight itself has also become **politicized**]{.underline}.
[Politicians increasingly turn to those with military experience to
**run the Pentagon**]{.underline}. Trump decided to appoint a former
general, Mattis, as secretary of defense, and [Biden]{.underline} did
the same, [put]{.underline}ting **[Lloyd Austin]{.underline}** [in the
post]{.underline}. In both cases, [Congress had to waive a requirement
that officers be retired for at least **seven years**]{.underline}
before serving in the department's top job. The rule, which had been
broken only once before, is designed to prioritize leaders with distance
from the mindset and social networks associated with military service.
Ideally, defense secretaries should be comfortable operating as
civilians---not soldiers. Mattis's and [Austin's]{.underline}
nominations, and subsequent [confirmations]{.underline}, therefore
[represent a break with over **seven decades**]{.underline} [of law and
tradition]{.underline}, beginning with the 1947 reforms, stipulating
that the secretary of defense cannot be a recently retired general.

There is no obvious reason to think that those with military experience
are better suited to controlling the military on behalf of Congress or
the president---and plenty of reasons to suspect the opposite. In the
military, soldiers are taught to follow orders, not scrutinize their
implications, as a cabinet official should. Military personnel,
moreover, are ideally taught to stay out of partisan debates, whereas
the secretary's job demands well-honed political skill and experience.
Yet as Mattis's and Austin's appointments show, military service is
becoming a litmus test for Pentagon policy jobs traditionally held by
civilians, and this is true even at lower levels.

Meanwhile, the public is failing to insist that elected leaders hold the
military to account. Many Americans would rather put troops on a
pedestal and admire the military from afar. Repeating the mantra
"Support our troops" has become a substitute for the patriotic duty of
questioning the institution those troops serve. Large numbers of
citizens are now reluctant to even offer their opinions in response to
survey questions about the military, let alone to criticize military
leaders. In a 2013 YouGov survey, for instance, 25 to 30 percent of the
nonveterans asked consistently chose "I don't know" or "no opinion" in
response to questions about the military.

At best, these trends immunize the military from scrutiny; at worst,
they give it a pass to behave with impunity. An October 2017 White House
press conference epitomized this exceptionalism: during a discussion of
Trump's condolence call to the widow of a slain soldier, Kelly, who had
served in the military for more than four decades and whose own son was
killed fighting in Afghanistan, refused to call on journalists who
didn't know someone who had had a family member killed in combat. Sarah
Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, later admonished
journalists for daring to question Kelly. Debating "a four-star Marine
general," she said, was "highly inappropriate."

ORIGIN STORY

Part of [the decline in civil-military relations can be blamed on
**institutional changes**]{.underline}. [As the United States became a
global power]{.underline}, elected leaders developed a bureaucratic
structure to manage the military on a day-to-day basis. When it became
clear at the start of the Cold War that the U.S. defense establishment
had become too large for the president and the legislature to control on
their own, Congress passed the National Security Act of 1947. The law
established what would eventually become the Department of Defense and
placed at its head a civilian secretary of defense, who would bring
experience managing bureaucratic and domestic politics. That person
would have the exclusive job of ensuring that the military's activities
aligned with the nation's goals as determined by its elected political
leaders. And Congress granted the secretary a civilian staff composed of
individuals who could draw on their experiences in government, business,
and academia.

But in 1986, Congress unintentionally undid much of this work. That
year, it overhauled the 1947 law by passing the Goldwater-Nichols
Department of Defense Reorganization Act, which shifted power and
resources away from civilian leaders and to their military counterparts.
Since that law passed, large, [**well-resourced** military staffs have
**displaced** civilians in the Pentagon and across the rest of the
government]{.underline}. Today, for example, [ambassadors and other
civilian officials frequently depend on the military's regional
combatant commands]{.underline} for resources, including planes and
logistical support, necessary to do their jobs. Regional combatant
commanders also have responsibilities that cross national boundaries,
giving them de facto diplomatic authority and frequent contact not only
with their military counterparts overseas but also with foreign
government leaders. The military officials who govern security
assistance and cooperation programs have also grown in number and
influence, further sidelining their civilian counterparts in the State
Department.

It is a truism in national security discourse that diplomats are
underfunded relative to the military. Even former defense secretaries,
including Mattis and Robert Gates, have warned Congress of the risks of
underfunding the State Department. But no one ever does much about it.
Without a serious attempt at rebalancing, the military's personnel and
resource advantages will only further undermine civilian control, giving
the military extra speed and capacity that it can leverage during
bureaucratic fights to make and implement policy.

At the same time, there has also been a hollowing out of the processes
of civilian control within the Department of Defense itself. In recent
years, the Pentagon has faced immense difficulties recruiting,
retaining, and managing the civilian professional staff responsible for
overseeing the uniformed military. These challenges are the result of
underinvestment in the civilian workplace. There is little systematic
training to prepare civilian officials for their responsibilities, and
they are often thrown into the deep end of the Pentagon and left to sink
or swim. In contrast, service members benefit from thorough professional
military education programs and other developmental opportunities
throughout their careers.

By 2018, this situation had deteriorated to a point where the bipartisan
National Defense Strategy Commission, a congressionally appointed panel,
concluded that a lack of civilian voices in national security
decision-making was "undermining the concept of civilian control." To be
sure, these problems became more acute during the Trump administration,
when the Pentagon was littered with acting officials and unfilled
positions. But the civilian bench was shallow long before Trump took
over.

PLAYING POLITICS

**[Partisan polarization]{.underline}** [has also undermined civilian
control]{.underline}. **[After 9/11]{.underline}**, the public's esteem
for the military spiked, and politicians noticed. Elected
[leaders]{.underline} became increasingly willing to [disregard
civil-military norms]{.underline}, avoid serious oversight and
accountability, and encourage military insubordination to score
political points against their political opponents.

Today, [politicians on both sides of the aisle capitalize on the
military's **prestige** to shield themselves from criticism and attack
their rivals]{.underline}---often a cost-free strategy, given the
military's popularity. During campaigns, candidates often claim that
troops prefer them over their opponent; in 2020, a Trump ad featured the
tagline "Support our troops," and Biden cited a Military Times poll to
suggest that it was he who enjoyed their support. Candidates regularly
seek the endorsement of retired generals and even use them as partisan
attack dogs. At the 2016 Republican National Convention, the Trump
adviser Michael Flynn, who had then been out of the military for just
two years, criticized Trump's opponent, Hillary Clinton, and encouraged
the crowd to chant "Lock her up!" As president, Trump repeatedly
delivered partisan speeches in front of uniformed audiences, once
telling officers at MacDill Air Force Base, "We had a wonderful
election, didn't we? And I saw those numbers---and you like me, and I
like you." In over-the-top campaign videos, some post-9/11 veterans
running for office use their experience as a means of dividing those who
served from those who did not. In 2020, the Republican Texas congressman
and former Navy SEAL Dan Crenshaw released an Avengers-themed ad
entitled "Texas Reloaded" that featured attack helicopters, fighter
jets, and Crenshaw himself parachuting out of a plane.

More frequently ignored, however, are the less egregious moments of
politicization, such as presidents donning bomber jackets and flight
suits in public speeches to military audiences or venturing to West
Point to make major foreign policy addresses rather than to a civilian
university. All these actions reinforce the belief that military service
is superior to other kinds of public service.

Even though politicians try to gain electoral advantage through such
behavior, what they are ultimately doing is damaging their own
authority. By lionizing the armed forces, politicians teach the public
to expect elected officials to make concessions to military leaders or
defer to them on important decisions. This same dynamic motivates
civilian leaders to encourage officers to serve as "the adults in the
room," resist or oppose their partisan opponents' policies, or resign in
protest against a lawful order from an elected president. Although there
may be short-term advantages to such behavior (assuming, of course, that
the military leaders are correct), it subverts the broader principle
that civilians get to pursue the policies they were elected to carry
out.

The military has also played a role in the degradation of civilian
control. For one thing, its nonpartisan ethic is in decay. Whereas the
majority of senior military officers did not identify with a political
party as late as 1976, nearly three-quarters do so today, according to
surveys of senior officers attending various war colleges conducted
between 2017 and 2020. Many service members are comfortable airing their
partisan political commentary on social media to wide audiences, an
outspokenness that would have made past generations of soldiers blush.
Retired generals involved in politics---especially through campaign
endorsements---reinforce to those in uniform that the military is riven
by partisan divides. Senior military leaders have largely failed to
address this behavior, either looking the other way or attributing it to
a few bad apples. Their silence, however, normalizes partisanship in the
military, with those in uniform concluding that it is acceptable to
openly pick political sides. Recent surveys of senior active-duty
officers found that roughly one-third had observed their colleagues make
or share disparaging comments about elected officials on social media.

Service members also make civilian control that much harder when they
act as if they are superior to their civilian counterparts. Research
consistently shows that many in the military believe that their decision
to serve in uniform makes them morally superior to those Americans who
did not make that choice. According to a 2020 survey by the research
institution NORC, this sense of superiority extends even to their views
of those Americans whose jobs also entail significant risks---including
doctors fighting the pandemic and diplomats serving in combat zones or
in hardship assignments. At the extreme, military personnel question the
legitimacy of the civilians who oversee them, especially if they suspect
that those leaders don't share their partisan views.

Another factor undermining civilian authority is the military's
attachment to the notion that it should have exclusive control over what
it views as its own affairs. This concept, endorsed by the political
scientist Samuel Huntington, contends that the military has a right to
push back when civilians attempt to interfere in military matters.
According to this view, autonomy is a right, not a privilege. But
military and political affairs are not as distinct as many officers have
been led to believe, and the experience of other countries suggests that
alternative models are just as plausible: throughout Europe, for
example, military leaders are accustomed to much more intrusive
oversight than their U.S. counterparts.

HOLLYWOOD TREATMENT

[Trends in **American culture** underpin many of these
problems]{.underline}. [Americans increasingly
**fetishize**]{.underline} [the armed forces]{.underline} and believe
that the only true patriots are those in uniform. According to Gallup
polling, [the public consistently has **more confidence**]{.underline}
[in the military than in **any other** national
institution]{.underline}. [That admiration, coupled with declining trust
and confidence in civilian organizations, means that large segments of
the population think]{.underline} that [those in uniform should
run]{.underline} the military, and maybe even [the **country
itself**]{.underline}.

This adoration has grown in part out of efforts to bring the military
out of its post-Vietnam malaise. In 1980, Edward Meyer, the army chief
of staff, declared his force a "hollow army," and that same year, an
operation intended to rescue U.S. hostages in Iran ended in disaster,
showing the public just how depleted its armed forces had become. While
Congress attempted to rectify the situation by ramping up military
spending, the military cannily worked to rehabilitate its image through
popular culture. In the 1980s, the Pentagon cooperated with big-budget
movies such as Top Gun, a practice it has continued to the present with
such superhero films as Captain Marvel. By conditioning its cooperation
and provision of equipment on approval of the script, the military
learned that it could influence storylines and enhance its brand.

Another contributing problem is the military's tendency to recruit
heavily from particular subsections of American society. With few calls
for shared sacrifice or national mobilization during the wars in
Afghanistan and Iraq, the majority of the public had little to do
besides thank the troops for their service. The military, meanwhile went
to great lengths to honor soldiers with patriotic displays centered on
the nobility of military service, notably during college and
professional sporting events. These trends all reinforced the notion
that military service members were truly exceptional---better,
different, and more selfless than the civilians who cheered them on.

Less than halfway through the year, the May 19, 2022 passage of more
than \$41 billion in emergency funding for Ukraine positions the country
to become the largest single recipient of U.S. security sector
assistance in 2022. The latest funding includes at least \$6 billion in
direct military aid to Ukraine, and billions more for Ukraine and other
European partners. Altogether, even a conservative estimate places the
value of the military assistance [Ukraine will receive in 2022 as
**equivalent** to what the U.S. provided **Afghanistan**, **Israel**,
and **Egypt** in FY2020 **combined**]{.underline}.

In the aftermath of Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea, Ukraine had
already become the most significant recipient of U.S. security
assistance in Europe, receiving \$2.7 billion in American military aid
between 2014 and 2021. But now, those totals are being quickly eclipsed
as the United States and its western allies rush billions of dollars
worth of weaponry to Kyiv.

The unprecedented sum reflects both the strategic earthquake resulting
from Russia's invasion as well as the West's evolving assessment of
Ukraine's prospects in its fight with Moscow. With such enormous
quantities of weaponry now making their way to Ukraine, it's worth
reflecting on the evolution of this extraordinary surge in international
military assistance and its consequences.

What's Been Committed to Ukraine Since the February 24, 2022 Invasion

After Russia crossed into Ukraine on February 24, 2022, the United
States massively expanded its security assistance efforts and began
making use of emergency authorities to expedite the transfer of weaponry
and equipment to the country. Since February 2022, the United States has
provided \$3.9 billion in security sector assistance to Ukraine. In
short, in less than three months between February and April 2022, the
United States provided one billion more in security assistance than it
did in the seven years between 2014 and 2021.

The United States has provided a wide range of weapons and equipment.
According to U.S. government reports, as of May 6th, United States had
committed the following:

- More than 1,400 Stinger anti-aircraft systems

- 5,500 Javelin anti-armor systems

- 14,000 other anti-armor weapon systems

- 700 Switchblade drones and an undisclosed number of Phoenix Ghost
  Tactical Drones

- 16 helicopters

- Hundreds of High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles

- 90 155mm Howitzer artillery pieces and nearly 200,000 shells

- 200 armored personnel carriers

- 7,000 small arms

- 50 million rounds of small arms ammunition

The vast quantity of weapons and equipment provided to Ukraine totals
over \$3.8 billion so far and excludes the billions in military related
assistance in the emergency supplemental passed by Congress on May 19.
The new funding package adds an additional \$6 billion for the Ukraine
Security Assistance Initiative -- the Ukraine-specific program that
funds defense acquisition for the government in Kyiv -- and an
additional \$4 billion in Foreign Military Financing for Ukraine and
other European allies. Additionally, the bill adds \$9.05 billion to
replenish U.S. weapons stockpiles depleted by a series of transfers to
Ukraine and other neighboring states. [The bill also raises the
**statutory limit** for what the President is permitted to transfer from
existing U.S. weapons stockpiles]{.underline} to \$11 billion, providing
another pool of equipment that the President can draw from.

[Arriving at an **exact total**]{.underline} [for military
aid]{.underline} committed to Ukraine in the aftermath of this bill's
passage [is]{.underline} **[challenging]{.underline}**. Much of the
assistance is being made available to Ukraine and "and countries
impacted by the situation in Ukraine." In addition, the funding for
stockpile replenishment may not represent the exact equivalent of
military hardware that has already been transferred to Kyiv.
Nevertheless, [estimates of the **aggregate value** of military aid
committed to Kyiv would likely make Ukraine the **largest yearly** U.S.
security assistance recipient of the **21st century**.]{.underline}

The Evolution of U.S. Security Assistance to Ukraine

Changes in the scale, scope, and makeup of U.S. security assistance over
the first four months of the conflict in Ukraine reflect shifting war
imperatives, political realities, and appraisals of potential conflict
outcomes.

The earliest days of the war following Russia's invasion in February
2022 were characterized by positional urban fighting and small unit
tactics. The United States, Kyiv, and other international partners were
focused on equipping forces defending key urban areas with weaponry that
could be quickly delivered and used without significant sustainment or
training need. The result was thousands of shoulder-fired anti-armor and
anti-air missiles, thousands of small arms, and millions of rounds of
small arms ammunition pouring into the country. Just over two weeks
after the beginning of the conflict, by March 16, 2022, U.S.-origin
equipment committed to Ukraine included:

- 600 Stinger anti-aircraft systems

- 2,600 Javelin anti-armor systems

- Tactical drones

- 200 shotguns

- 200 machine guns

- 40 million rounds of small arms ammunition

- 1 million grenade, mortar, and artillery rounds

While the United States did provide a handful of rotary aircraft and
armored personnel carriers, much like Ukraine's other military patrons,
Washington was acutely concerned that the provision of more advanced or
heavy weaponry could provoke an escalation from Moscow. In striking the
balance of providing weapons to help Ukraine defend itself, Washington
sought to test the limits of assistance without sparking a wider war or
a direct retaliation from the Kremlin, especially as President Putin
rattled his nuclear saber. Those sensitivities were on full display
after a surprise proposal from Poland to transfer some of its Soviet-era
fighter jets to Ukraine in exchange for new U.S. aircraft was shot down
by the Biden Administration for fear it was too direct an incitement of
Russian animosity.

Those calculations changed in late March, as stiff Ukrainian resistance
and failures in the Russian assault allowed Kyiv to withstand much of
the Kremlin's initial offensive, especially around the capital.
Incapable of managing their stretched logistics and maintaining pressure
around so many axes of advance, Russia elected to withdraw from
significant portions of the country and re-orient their war effort
toward seizing the country's east and, potentially, coastal south.

The battlefield transition also catalyzed a transition in Washington's
view of the conflict and the nature of its security assistance to
Ukraine. Strategically, it crystallized assessments that Ukraine and its
government would survive the conflict with significant territory under
its control and could potentially reclaim some areas it lost to Russia
in the conflict's initial phase. With the imminent and existential
threat relatively at bay, and with somewhat more generous time horizons,
new opportunities to consider security packages with more advanced
weaponry with longer lead times became viable.

Additionally, a battle for Ukraine's east represents a fundamentally
different operational context. Far from the positional urban fighting
that Ukraine was able to master early on, the famed Eurasian steppe
presents new advantages for Russia. Shorter supply lines, a more
concentrated frontline, and open terrain that advantages Russia's
mechanized armor and long-range heavy firepower will create significant
tactical challenges for Ukrainian defenders. As Ukraine's foreign
minister put it to a NATO gathering, "the battle for Donbas will remind
you of the Second World War with large operations, thousands of tanks,
armored vehicles, planes, artillery."

Accordingly, in this new phase of the conflict, the United States has
dramatically enhanced its security assistance to Ukraine, expanding to
newer, more advanced weapons systems that speak to the particular
battlefield realities of this new phase in the war. With battlefield
outcomes now being determined by the accuracy and range of heavy
weaponry, the U.S. has committed additional artillery, air defense
systems, advanced radar systems, more rotary aircraft, and a slew of
never before seen drones that will see some of their first combat in
Ukraine. The change reflects both the new battlefield challenges Ukraine
will face in the Donbas, but also the view from Washington that Russia's
warnings against providing additional weaponry to Kyiv are mostly
rhetorical.

In addition, the United States has expanded its assistance in
non-material but strategically significant ways. Perhaps most important
has been Washington's provision of real-time intelligence to Ukrainian
forces. Reports suggest that Ukraine has made use of the information to
target high-ranking Russian military officials and to sink Russia's
famed Black Sea flagship, the Moskva. The U.S. has also begun providing
training to Ukrainian troops on some of the new weapon systems they are
set to receive, though the training continues to take place outside of
Ukraine.

Extraordinary Authorities

Since 2014, the United States has relied on a handful of conventional
[**s**ecurity **c**ooperation]{.underline} and assistance authorities to
support Ukraine's defense and security forces, including Foreign
Military Financing, International Military Education and Training, and
the purpose-built Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative. These programs
followed typical Congressional appropriations processes and reflected a
more methodical approach to building Ukrainian security capacity.

However, [current events have changed the **traditional** assistance
model]{.underline}. In late 2021, as the U.S. intelligence community
became convinced that a Russian invasion was imminent, the United States
faced a new urgency to shore up Ukrainian defenses against the
substantially more developed military might of the Kremlin. [The Biden
Administration reached for **new** and **exceptional** tools to get
hardware to Ukrainians quickly]{.underline}.

The most prominent of those exceptional tools has been [the
**Presidential Drawdown Authority**]{.underline}, which [allows the
**Executive Branch** to **take weapons**, ammunition, and other materiel
from existing U.S. stocks and provide them to other countries **without
congressional authorization**]{.underline}. [The Biden Administration
has invoked the authority **ten times**]{.underline} [for Ukraine since
August 2021]{.underline}. [To put that in context]{.underline}, a 2016
Government Accountability Office report found that [the authority was
invoked just **11** times between 2011 and 2015]{.underline}. The
authority offers some advantages in the current context, including
reducing lead times for materiel from months or years to days and weeks.

Additionally, in March 2022, [the President invoked an emergency
authority under the **Arms Export Control Act**, which allows the
Executive Branch to **bypass** the statutorily mandated **congressional
notification** process and **proceed immediately** with an international
arms sale or export]{.underline}. The authority requires the Executive
to certify that an emergency exists that creates a national security
imperative for the immediate sale or export of defense articles or
services without the typical 15-30 pause for notification and
congressional consideration. The authority has only been invoked on a
handful of occasions, including in 2019 when President Trump
controversially used it to transfer munitions and other defense articles
to members of the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen without
congressional notification and despite strong congressional opposition.

[Congress has also passed an updated version of the World War II-era
**Lend Lease Act**, authorizing the Administration to provide military
equipment]{.underline} to Ukraine and other countries [in the region on
an **indefinite basis**]{.underline} [and without the need to come back
to Congress for **additional funding**]{.underline}. During the Second
World War, President Franklin D. Roosevelt used the statute to arm
Britain and, to a lesser degree, Russia.

In addition, with the passage of the most recent 41 billion dollar
package, [the President has]{.underline} now submitted and been
[granted]{.underline} two emergency supplemental funding requests to
Congress amounting to [more than \$**54 billion**]{.underline} [related
to Ukraine]{.underline} including at least \$32.3 billion for European
theatre defense and **[security assistance]{.underline}**.

Conclusion

The war in Ukraine has fundamentally shifted the focus of U.S. military
assistance. For the first time in the 21st century, the largest
recipient of U.S. security assistance is not in the Middle East or
Central Asia, but in Europe. The war in Ukraine has become the defining
foreign policy priority of the Biden Administration, and with a growing
consensus in Western capitals that the end to the war is nowhere in
sight, it is likely that the volume of military assistance the United
States provides to Ukraine will continue to climb.

The United States faces a complex array of threats to national security
in the political, economic, military, and social domains. State and

realm of]{.underline} space, **[cyberspace]{.underline}**, proliferation
of weapons of mass destruction, high performance
**[computing]{.underline}**, [and other emerging and disruptive
technologies]{.underline}. Furthermore, threats to national security are
no longer isolated to state or non-state actors. As identified by the
intelligence community, infectious disease outbreaks and climate change
threaten security and stability around the globe and have significant
implications for U.S. national security as well as military operations.

[The committee will conduct oversight of numerous
**cross-cutting**]{.underline} [Department of Defense activities central

Maintaining U.S. Superiority in Conventional Weapon Technologies

As part of the renewed emphasis on capabilities for high-end
conventional warfare, [DOD officials have expressed concern that **U.S.
superiority** in conventional weapon technologies has
**narrowed**]{.underline} [or]{.underline} in some cases even [been
**eliminated**]{.underline} [by **China** and]{.underline} (in certain
areas) **[Russia]{.underline}**. In response, DOD has taken a number of
actions in recent years that are intended [to]{.underline} help
[maintain or **regain U.S. superiority** in conventional weapon
technologies]{.underline}, including increased research and development
funding for new militarily applicable technologies such as artificial
intelligence (AI), autonomous unmanned weapons, hypersonic weapons,
directed-energy weapons, biotechnology, and quantum technology. 68 A
February 2, 2022, press report stated:

Innovation and Speed of U.S. Weapon System Development and Deployment

In addition to the above-mentioned efforts for maintaining U.S.
superiority in conventional weapon technologies, DOD is placing new
emphasis on innovation and speed in weapon system development and
deployment, so as to more quickly and effectively transition new weapon
technologies into fielded systems. The 2018 NDS places states

> Deliver performance at the speed of relevance. Success no longer goes
> to the country that develops a new technology first, but rather to the
> one that better integrates it and adapts its way of fighting. Current
> processes are not responsive to need; the Department is overoptimized
> for exceptional performance at the expense of providing timely
> decisions, policies, and capabilities to the warfighter. Our response
> will be to prioritize speed of delivery, continuous adaptation, and
> frequent modular upgrades. We must not accept cumbersome approval
> chains, wasteful applications of resources in uncompetitive space, or
> overly risk-averse thinking that impedes change. Delivering
> performance means we will shed outdated management practices and
> structures while integrating insights from business innovation.70

The individual military services have taken various actions in recent
years to increase innovation and speed in their weapon acquisition
programs. Some of these actions make use of special acquisition
authorities provided by Congress in recent years that are intended in
part to reduce the time needed to transition new weapon technologies
into fielded systems, including Other Transaction Authority (OTA) and
what is known as Section 804 Middle Tier authority.71

On January 23, 2020, DOD released a new defense acquisition framework,
called the Adaptive Acquisition Framework, that is intended to
substantially accelerate the DOD's process for developing and fielding
new weapons.72 In previewing the new framework in October 2019, DOD
described it as "the most transformational acquisition policy change
we've seen in decades." 73

Some observers argue that [DOD is not doing enough or moving **quickly**
enough to generate and implement innovations in response to **great
power competition**]{.underline}, and have proposed steps for doing more
or moving more quickly.74 **[\<\<\<FOOTNOTE 74

deployment]{.underline}, U.S. defense acquisition policy and [the
**oversight paradigm**]{.underline} for assessing the success of
acquisition programs [will need to be **adjusted** to place a **greater

defense acquisition policy, alongside more traditional measures of merit
such as minimizing cost growth, schedule delays, and problems in
testing. As a consequence, they argue, defense acquisition policy and
the [oversight]{.underline} paradigm for assessing the success of
acquisition programs [should place **more emphasis**]{.underline} [on
time as a **risk factor**]{.underline} [and feature **more
experimentation**]{.underline}, [**risk-taking**, and **tolerance of
failure** during development]{.underline}, with a lack of failures in
testing potentially being viewed in some cases not as an indication of
success, but of inadequate innovation or speed of development.76

Mobilization Capabilities for Extended-Length Conflict

The renewal of [great power competition has led to an **increased
emphasis**]{.underline} [in discussions of U.S. defense on]{.underline}
U.S. mobilization [capabilities for an **extended-length**
conflict]{.underline}.77 The term mobilization is often used to refer
specifically to preparations for activating U.S. military reserve force
personnel and inducting additional people into the Armed Forces. In this
report, it is used more broadly, to refer to various activities,
including those relating to the ability of the industrial base to
support U.S. military operations in a larger-scale, extended-length
conflict against China or Russia. Under this broader definition,
mobilization capabilities include but are not limited to capabilities
for

> • inducting and training additional military personnel to expand the
> size of the force or replace personnel who are killed or wounded;
>
> • producing new weapons and supplies to replace those expended in the
> earlier stages of a conflict, and delivering those weapons and
> supplies to distantly deployed U.S. forces in a timely manner;
>
> • repairing battle damage to ships, aircraft, and vehicles;
>
> • replacing satellites or other support assets that are lost in
> combat; and
>
> • manufacturing spare parts and consumable items.

Some observers have expressed concern about the adequacy of U.S.
mobilization capabilities, particularly since this was not a major
defense-planning concern during the 20 to 25 years of the post-Cold War
era, and have recommended various actions to improve those capabilities.

### 2AC\-\--Polarization Turn

#### [Polarization]{.underline} makes congressional oversight ineffective

researcher at the Chair for Multi-Level Governance at the Department of
Political Science at Freiburg University AND Jordan Tama, Provost Assoc

[Domestic polarization not only affects the policymaking process but
also the way policies become implemented]{.underline}. Scholars of US
foreign policy have shown that over time, **[the highly contentious
forces of domestic politics in some policy areas, such as international
economics, have incentivized the president to rely more heavily on other
instruments, such as military deployments]{.underline}** and defense
procurement (Milner and Tingley 2015). Others have shown that partisan
incentives have reduced presi- dents' use of force abroad and influenced
how presidents carry out military operations (Howell and Pevehouse,
2007; Kriner 2010). Meanwhile, others have found that greater prospects
for legislative success incline the president to engage in more
high-risk military interventions and fewer humanitarian interventions
(Marshall and Prins 2016). In addition, **[studies on presidential use
of executive agreements suggest that domestic polarization inclines
presidents to advance their agenda unilaterally]{.underline}** (Caruson
and Farrar-Myers 2007; Amirfar and Singh 2018).

[Polarization also influences the effectiveness of US foreign policy
execution]{.underline}. As some scholars have argued, **[polarization
has limited the rally-around-the-flag effect in response to external
security threats]{.underline}** (Myrick 2021). In addition, political
and material costs for the execution of certain partisan foreign
policies and visions of international order have increased in times of
domestic polarization (Bafumi and Parent 2012; Kreps et al. 2018). As a
consequence of the widening gap domestically for a cohesive strategy,
[the executive branch is more incentivized to politicize US foreign
policy through wedge-issues to weaken political opposition]{.underline}
(Snyder et al. 2009). **[This, in turn, has contributed to a
polarization of US relationships with allies and partners]{.underline}**
(Drezner 2018).

### 2AC\-\--Morale Turn

Associate Professor and Director of Undergraduate Programs at the Schar

[Part of the job of any manager, in any organisational setting, is to
motivate employees]{.underline}. Doing so involves cultivating employee
work attitudes (e.g. job satisfaction, organisational commitment) and
behaviours (e.g. arriving to work on time, aiding coworkers) that are
thought to be associated with individual- and organisational-level
performance. In exercising its oversight function, however, [Congress is
not necessarily interested in doing these things]{.underline}. [Instead,
it is primarily interested in ensuring federal agencies' responsiveness
to legislative preferences]{.underline}.4 [However, in pursuing
responsiveness, Congress can unwittingly harm agency
morale]{.underline}. Before fully developing this argument below, we
define the empirical focus of our study -- agency morale -- and discuss
its importance for agency performance. [We use the term "agency morale"
to denote agency employees' collective feelings of autonomy and job
satisfaction]{.underline}. Theory and evidence from the organisational
behaviour literature suggest that, at the individual level, both of
these traits are positively related to job performance. In a
meta-analysis of 312 independent samples, Judge et al. (2001) found a
correlation between job satisfaction and job performance of 0.30.
Similarly, in a meta-analysis of 101 independent samples, [Spector
(1986) found a correlation between autonomy and job performance of 0.26.
In fact, these correlations likely underestimate the total impact of job
satisfaction and autonomy on performance, given that both are associated
with numerous other work attitudes and behaviours that are themselves
related to performance]{.underline}. These include, for instance,
organisational commitment, role conflict, role ambiguity, emotional
distress, absenteeism, turnover intention and actual turnover (Spector
1986; Mathieu and Zajac 1990; Tett and Meyer 1993; Meyer et al. 2002;
Riketta 2002). [Theories of public sector organisational effectiveness
and political control pay special attention to autonomy. The former
typically emphasises autonomy's salutary operational qualities: it
allows agencies to use their expertise to solve pressing implementation
problems, make and execute decisions quickly, and pursue their missions
in an administratively rational manner]{.underline} (see, e.g. Wilson
1989; Wolf 1993; Meier 1997; Rainey and Steinbauer 1999; Brewer and
Selden 2000). These theories also assume that autonomy has motivational
benefits at the employee level. Individuals -- particularly individuals
with high levels of formal education and professional training -- value
autonomy and work harder when it is given to them (see, e.g. Gagné and
Deci 2005). In contrast[, theories of political control tend to view
autonomy as necessary -- bureaucracies have expertise that political
actors lack, and so delegations of authority are sometimes unavoidable
-- but potentially problematic, given that bureaucracies are
nonelectoral institutions. Yet, even political theories note the
importance of autonomy for organisational performance]{.underline}.
Gailmard and Patty (2007, 2012), for example, argue that congressional
principals, who generally prefer informed to uninformed policymaking,
proactively grant autonomy and policymaking discretion to bureaucratic
agents in order to incentivise investments in expertise. Whatever their
differences, both schools tend to agree that autonomy is systematically
associated with organisational performance and the development of policy
expertise. Consequently, we believe it is important to examine whether
congressional oversight is associated with agency autonomy.
Congressional oversight and its managerial consequences [We expect that
congressional oversight will be negatively associated with autonomy and
job satisfaction when such oversight is primarily meant to monitor and
control the bureaucracy for political reasons, rather than to aid it in
the performance of agency duties]{.underline} (Weingast and Moran 1983;
Ferejohn and Shipan 1990; Shipan 2004). [Congress is often unlike the
manager or firm owner described in standard economic accounts of
principal-agent theory. In these accounts, it is usually assumed that
the principal is concerned with securing some outcome and is, moreover,
happy to let the agent choose whatever means or behaviours best serve
that end]{.underline} (for a review, see Eisenhardt 1989). [The
congressional impulse to control, however, often seeks to dictate the
bureaucracy's choice of means. This impulse is intensified in our
separation of powers system, where Congress often competes with the
president for agency influence]{.underline} (Shapiro 1994; Whitford
2005). Below, we identify three particular mechanisms through which
congressional oversight can harm agency morale and conclude by arguing
that oversight's relationship with morale is ultimately conditional on
whether it is adversarial or friendly. Mechanism I: micromanagement
[Consistent with the predilection of Congress to be interested in
control rather than performance, scholars have long noted that its
oversight relationship with the federal bureaucracy has been
characterised by micromanagement]{.underline}, or "intervention by
Congress in administrative details" (Gilmour and Halley 1994, 10). As
early as 1885, Woodrow Wilson complained that Congress "has entered more
and more into the details of the administration, until it has virtually
taken into its own hands all the substantial powers of government"
(Wilson 1896, cited in Beermann 2006). Similarly, Wilson wrote that
"Congress is commonly criticized for 'micromanaging' government
agencies; it does and it always has" (1989, 241). More recently, Behn
identified political micromanagement as one of public administration's
most pressing problems and elucidated how it hampers agency performance:
"The legislative branch is, for some reason, unhappy with the way an
executive-branch agency is performing; so the legislators impose some
rules on the agency ... These new rules prevent, or at least constrain,
the agency from doing what the legislature dislikes. Unfortunately,
these rules also constrain the agency from producing the results for
which it is responsible" (1995, 316). [There is reason to believe that
oversight has become increasingly driven by this impulse to micromanage
and constrain bureaucratic discretion. Summarising a series of 10 case
studies on oversight]{.underline}, Gilmour and Halley concluded: [The
cases show a "congressional co-manager" intervening directly in the
details of policy development and management rather than enacting vague,
wide-ranging, sweeping statutes to change fundamental policy
directions]{.underline} ... Gone almost without a trace is the post-New
Deal Congress that optimistically delegated broad-scale public problems
and policy questions for solution and resolution by the executive
branch. Much diminished as well is an executive branch relied upon by
Congress for neutral competence and specialized expertise. Instead, the
story ... is one of the retrieval of executive discretion and the highly
specific redefinition---by Congress---of prior delegations of authority.
(1994, 335--336) In the same vein, Aberbach (1990) showed that the
average number of pages per statute enacted by Congress rose sharply
between the 80th (1947--1948) and the 103rd (1993--1994) sessions of
Congress, indicating an increased command-and-control orientation in
legislative-bureaucratic relations. More recently, Balla and Deering
(2013) coded a sample of all congressional hearings that occurred during
the 96th (1979--1981), 100th (1987--1989), 104th (1995--1997) and 108th
(2003--2004) sessions of Congress. They found that most hearings -- over
80% in each session -- are police patrols, as opposed to fire alarms,
indicating that Congress has an abiding interest in monitoring what the
federal bureaucracy is doing and in how it is doing it. As a recent
illustration of this mechanism, scholarly research and witness testimony
from administrators from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
(CMS) attest that members of Congress are keen to micromanage policies
governing provider payment (Pham et al. 2009). [Besides this
micromanagement mechanism, there are at least two more possible avenues
by which oversight may harm agency morale. First, preparing for and
participating in oversight hearings, especially high-profile ones,
levies opportunity costs on agency employees. Rather than focussing on,
say, fulfilling their missions, or competently implementing legislative
policy, agency employees must respond to the priorities of a committee
holding an oversight hearing. We call these opportunity costs short
term]{.underline} to differentiate them from the more fundamental (and
psychological) crowding-out of experienced meaning that congressional
micromanagement entails. Finally, [it is reasonable to assume that
negative congressional attention whose aim is to publicly embarrass
high-level agency managers would be demoralising to the agency as a
whole. A recent example of this involves the General Services
Administration (GSA) and the attention it received in 2012, after
stories of wasteful spending at its Western Regions Conference surfaced
in the media]{.underline}. The aftermath included many high-profile
oversight hearings and numerous internal reports that sought to assign
responsibility for the agency's actions. As "fraud, waste and abuse" are
anathema to both parties, Democrats as well as Republicans relentlessly
attacked the GSA in hearings. In this instance, Congress can be seen to
have had a genuine interest in improving GSA performance into the
future. In other words[, this was an ideal opportunity for Congress to
act as a genuine performance manager -- that is, to take a sincere
interest in remedying whatever underlying organisational
problems]{.underline} (e.g. issues with organisational culture,
ineffective internal accountability structures, etc.) [may have
contributed to the GSA scandal. Instead, Congress appeared to be more
interested in obtaining whatever political mileage it could by publicly
scolding top-level GSA employees.]{.underline}

Had Democrats decisively won control of the White House and the Senate,
there would be a robust conversation around legislatively expanding the
federal government's authority for technology oversight. While this
conversation would take a backseat to issues like fighting the COVID-19
pandemic and shoring up the economy, legislation on new data privacy and
algorithmic consumer protections could have had a chance in the first
term of the Biden administration. Even a technology oversight agency
would have been possible, and perhaps still is, pending the results from
the Georgia special elections. Yet, even without a Democratic majority
in the Senate, there are meaningful steps that the Biden administration
can take to further reasonable oversight of the technology sector, and
specifically the largely unregulated use of artificial intelligence (AI)
and algorithmic decision-making. The Biden administration can reverse
Trump-era executive orders and agency regulations, instead requiring
federal agencies to enforce existing discrimination laws on algorithmic
systems and expanding their regulatory capacity to do so.
[President-elect Biden should push Congress to enact new algorithmic
consumer protections in any new legislative compromises on privacy or
antitrust, and further support the revival of the Office of Technology
Assessment. These efforts are likely not sufficient in the long
term]{.underline}. The digital economy accounts for over 9% of
GDP--larger than the finance sector--and was growing at 6.8% per year
before the pandemic. Since the rise of the modern regulatory state in
the 1970s, perhaps no other segment of the overall economy has
experienced such growth while remaining largely unregulated. Even that
framing understates the importance of data systems and algorithms, which
are affecting nearly every part of our society. While the economic
growth is undeniable, [the mass proliferation of data systems and
algorithms---especially in the form of permissionless innovation---has
enabled extensive societal harms. A new regulatory agency, or expanded
capacity of an existing agency such as the Federal Trade Commission, is
necessary]{.underline}. For now, however, the Biden administration
should take the available steps to curtail the direct harms, especially
algorithmic discrimination, enabled by AI. EXECUTIVE ACTIONS TO ENFORCE
EXISTING LAWS [The use of algorithmic decision-making in many industries
poses serious challenges for regulatory enforcement of existing
laws]{.underline}. Health insurance companies implement risk prediction
tools that are likely prioritizing care in racially biased ways, which
is illegal for any providers receiving federal funds from programs like
CHIP and Medicaid or insurers participating in the Affordable Care Act
exchanges. AI systems used to perform automated video interviews are
undoubtedly deeply flawed as well, and there is cause for investigation
to see if they discriminate against people with disabilities in
violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act. The algorithms that
manage Uber and Lyft drivers can make decisions that obscure the lines
between employee and independent contractor for purposes of enforcing
the Fair Labor Standards Act. However, the Office of Civil Rights within
the Department of Health and Human Services, the Equal Opportunity
Employment Commission, and the Department of Labor, respectively, may
not be equipped to handle these questions. [The Biden administration
should be more proactive than the Trump White House, which took minimal
action to avoid problems associated with the use of
algorithms.]{.underline} Following a February 2019 executive order, the
Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued its final guidance on the
regulation of artificial intelligence on Nov. 17, 2020. While there are
serious and reasonsed aspects of the document, [it makes clear that AI
innovation, and not regulatory protection, is the foremost
priority]{.underline} of the Trump administration. For instance, while
it seems encouraging that the guidance includes mention of "fairness and
non-discrimination" as well as "disclosure and transparency," these were
part of a long list of required considerations before implementing new
regulations. A careful reading of this document---such as the section
offering a series of non-regulatory interventions---suggests it is meant
to deter, not encourage or enable, new regulatory safeguards for AI
applications. It is possible that this is an overly critical reading of
the White House guidance---to its credit, it does prompt agencies to
think more about AI regulation. However, [the status quo is untenable,
as it functionally inoculates companies from anti-discrimination laws
when they use algorithms.]{.underline} Since this guidance from OMB
Director Russell Vought downplays the well-documented discriminatory
harms from some AI systems, the Biden administration should amend this
guidance to ensure that current law is appropriately enforced on
algorithmic systems. [Specific agency-level guidance needs reversal as
well, such as a rule from the Department of Housing and Urban
Development that places an insurmountable burden of proof on claims of
discrimination against algorithms used for mortgage loan or rental
applications.]{.underline} In order to execute on this guidance,
[federal agencies will need the capacity to investigate algorithmic
systems.]{.underline} These ex-post audits should focus on highly
impactful, large-scale AI systems, and especially those that have
already been implicated by nonprofits and academic evaluations. While it
may seem as though this would require the models themselves, this is far
less important than access to the underlying datasets and model outputs.
[Therefore, regulatory agencies should use available administrative
subpoena powers to gain access to the relevant corporate
datasets]{.underline}. There are already about 335 of these authorities
across the federal government. T[he auditing of these massive data
systems may be a daunting task for many agencies. In order to support
this new responsibility, the Biden administration should direct the
United States Digital Service (USDS) to hire a line of data scientists
and engineers to support the algorithmic regulatory capacity of federal
agencies.]{.underline} USDS has been a successful initiative to bring
technical talent into the federal government to modernize services, and
it is well-positioned to bring in the talent needed to build secure data
environments and conduct algorithmic audits. The Biden administration
should make this endeavor a policy priority, using hiring authority
within the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and
Presidential Innovation Fellowships to bring in more expertise. Lastly,
Biden should also endorse the revival of the Office of Technology
Assessment, which seeks to provide Congress with additional capacity and
more informed technology sector oversight. The fast pace of
technological development and proliferation has left Congress behind,
especially since the defunding of the original Office of Technology
Assessment in 1995. Further, congressional offices have reduced staff
funding in their Washington offices, leading to younger,
less-experienced staff working on a larger number of policy issues. This
is hardly an ideal outcome for handling the novel and complex challenges
posed for AI and technology governance. Of course, this is not to argue
that the Biden administration should only work to rein in the use of AI.
[The administration should continue the extensive new funding streams
from the National Science Foundation for National AI
Institutes.]{.underline} The administration should also keep engaging
the Global Partnership on AI, working toward democratic norms for AI's
role in the world. Investing in AI research and working toward global
consensus on AI are both critically important. However, [it is AI
oversight that needs a course correction.]{.underline} To keep citizens
safe from the overuse and abuse of algorithmic systems, the Biden
administration has much work to do---but it also has the tools to get
started.

But intelligence [oversight is complicated and has not sufficiently
evolved with the times]{.underline}. When it comes to assessing progress
of IC programs, [standard oversight processes typically track defined,
pre-determined requirements, cost, and timelines]{.underline}. These
metrics have worked reasonably well for large programs like the
acquisition of satellites and buildings, for which there is a clear
beginning, middle, and end, with easily identifiable milestones and a
definite budget. However, [AI is different; its development moves back
and forth across a spectrum of activities often without discrete
steps]{.underline}, and failure is a necessary part of the process as
the technology evolves and matures. [Traditional metrics are, therefore,
less effective for AI,]{.underline} as the value (or lack thereof) of
certain milestones may only become clear partway through the development
process and desired end-states may shift.

[Expansive]{.underline} new [cyber reporting requirements]{.underline}
now [appear dead in Congress. Congress has cut requirements for
companies to share cyber threat information]{.underline} with the
government from its must-pass defense bill, which passed the House last
night and is expected to pass the Senate shortly. [The failure of such a
popular and bipartisan effort -- which would have marked the largest
expansion of government involvement in private-sector cybersecurity in
years -- raises questions about whether Congress is up to the task of
responding to a wave of ransomware and other attacks that have battered
industry in recent years. It would have required companies in critical
industry sectors such as energy and transportation to alert the
Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency whenever they're hacked
or hit with other significant cyber incidents.]{.underline} It would
have required disclosures from a far broader group of companies if they
paid ransoms to hackers. But the measure also looked meager given the
hacking threats facing industry. More than 90 percent of cyber experts
and current and former officials supported the changes in a recent
Cybersecurity 202 poll. The government has already imposed far more
stringent cyber requirements on several key industry sectors in just the
past few months. "[This result is beyond disappointing and undermines
national security]{.underline}," said House Homeland Security Chairman
Bennie G. Thompson (D-Miss.) and Rep. Yvette Clarke (D-N.Y.), chair of
the committee's cyber panel and a sponsor of the House version of the
bill. Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) wanted to curtail a cyber reporting
provision in a major defense policy bill. It ended up getting cut
entirely. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) [The dispute centered on
the ransomware provision, which Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) considered too
broad, Senate aides told me. Scott wanted to substitute a provision that
would have limited ransomware reports to just critical infrastructure
--- that's a group of 16 industry sectors that includes financial
services, health care and chemical facilities among others. The fight
over the provision lasted so long that by the time they'd reached a
compromise, House and Senate negotiators who were putting together the
final bill ended up leaving it out entirely,]{.underline} as Tim Starks
reports for CyberScoop. The fine print Because of some peculiarities
about how the bill came together this year, lawmakers could still try to
add amendments in the Senate, including the cyber reporting provisions.
But leaders of the House and Senate Armed Services Committees are
begging them not to out of fear one or more of those amendments will
prevent the bill from passing entirely. If that happens, it would mark
the first time in more than five decades Congress has failed to pass the
bill, known as the National Defense Authorization Act. Sen. Gary Peters
(D-Mich.) championed a cyber reporting provision that got cut from the
National Defense Authorization Act. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)
The blame game: Thompson and Clarke laid the blame for provision being
cut at the feet of Senate Republican leaders as did Senate Homeland
Security Chairman Gary Peters (D-Mich.). ["I am disappointed Senate
Republican leaders blocked these common sense provisions that have broad
bipartisan support --- including from the bipartisan leaders of the
Senate Homeland Security and Intelligence Committees,"]{.underline}
Peters said. "Cyberattacks, including ransomware attacks, are one of the
greatest threats to our national and economic security." An aide for
Scott told The Hill's Maggie Miller that [Scott was disappointed the
full provision got left out of the NDAA and that he'd only wanted to
limit its scope. He denied Republicans were to blame.]{.underline}

Currently, existing laws, executive structure, and congressional
oversight mechanisms are a mismatch for the nature of the cybersecurity
challenges presented by a complex, technologically integrated society.
**[Existing mechanisms for congressional cybersecurity oversight are
likewise disjointed and uncoordinated]{.underline}**. Unlike in many
other policy areas[, there is no one clear committee or clear set of
committees responsible for cybersecurity issues]{.underline}. These are
divided among many committees in both the House of Representatives and
the Senate, often along historical lines that may not match current
expertise. [The Judiciary committees often encounter cybersecurity
issues in the context of surveillance, cybercrime enforcement, and
privacy issues]{.underline}. The Armed Services committees are called
upon to consider cybersecurity issues [when evaluating legislation
concerning offensive and defensive cyber capabilities]{.underline},
which are part of the government's response to counter hostile cyber
activities by foreign nation-states. The Intelligence committees engage
on cybersecurity activities most recently from the perspective of
[protecting electoral system infrastructure from foreign influence and
malign cyber activities related to foreign interference]{.underline} in
democratic processes. And the Homeland Security committees are heavily
involved in cybersecurity oversight due to the critical cybersecurity
functions that DHS provides in securing the federal government's
civilian networks and in coordinating information sharing between
government entities and the private sector. **[The lack of a
coordinating function among these committees limits Congress' ability to
obtain a comprehensive picture of the cybersecurity
problem,]{.underline}** particularly when these committees advance
legislation solely from their own jurisdictions.39

To develop a successful cybersecurity approach, [Congress must first be
able to obtain a comprehensive picture of the problem.]{.underline} This
is challenging, and not just because of the lack of committee
coordination. [The complex nature of the problem itself, previously
illustrated, requires gathering information about the interaction of a
large set of actors, economic sectors, and government
departments.]{.underline} How would increased organized criminal
investigative activities impact the incentives of potential nation-state
actors? How would the responses by those foreign actors alter the
availability of malicious tools and code to third parties targeting
private organizations and individuals? How might proposals to legalize
"hacking back" affect adversaries' incentives to engage in false-flag
operations? These are complicated questions spanning many different
areas yet attempts to address any one area impact nearly all others**[.
This is no easy challenge for Congress, made worse by the fact that it
is happening in real time, and pressure to act is growing on executive
agencies Congress must oversee.]{.underline}**

Since January 2019, in the 116th Congress, [there have been at least 13
hearings involving cybersecurity topics.]{.underline} [These 13 hearings
have been conducted by seven different congressional
committees,]{.underline} including three committees in the House of
Representatives and four committees in the Senate. [From January 2017 to
December 2018]{.underline}, in the 115th Congress, [there were at least
56]{.underline} hearings involving cybersecurity topics. [These 56
hearings were conducted by 17 different congressional
committees]{.underline}, including eight committees in the House of
Representatives and seven committees in the Senate. (See Appendix A for
a list of these hearings.) Meanwhile, specific members of Congress have
launched the Cyberspace Solarium Commission, mandated by the 2019
National Defense Authorization Act and comprised of members from both
chambers of Congress, as well as outside experts. The commission is
charged with "evaluating divergent approaches to defending the United
States in cyberspace and driving consensus toward a comprehensive
strategy."40 The commission's recommendations for developing this
strategy are scheduled to be delivered in a 2020 report.

The lack of committee coordination is only one aspect of the problem,
however. There are many different aspects to the cybersecurity problem,
most of which are interrelated and equally vulnerable to adversaries who
seek to compromise U.S. systems. In other words, attackers don't care
how they get in---only that they do. **[Their mechanisms do not neatly
(or even weakly) follow committee jurisdiction.]{.underline}** While the
disjointed committee patchwork could be interpreted as an argument for
intelligence oversight--style reform of congressional committee
structure, this is as deceptively incomplete an answer as is the myth of
information sharing or effective increased deterrence through criminal
penalty. **[Because it is precisely the patchwork nature of the
problem]{.underline}**---which spans questions in national defense, law
enforcement, agriculture, energy, transportation, finance, healthcare,
manufacturing, consumer protection, and a host of other areas---**[that
makes uncoordinated oversight]{.underline}** and legislation challenging
at best. At worst, **[it runs the risk of benefiting adversaries by
promoting a false sense of security when problems are addressed in one
area at the expense of ignoring another.]{.underline}**

[Cybersecurity oversight is due for a reboot.]{.underline} This paper
explores the need for refreshed congressional oversight of
cybersecurity. After laying out why [cybersecurity oversight presents
special challenges]{.underline}, this paper suggests that [the disparate
nature of the cybersecurity policymaking legal framework is mismatched
to the nature of the cybersecurity problem, resulting in difficulty
legislating in this space]{.underline}. It then provides two key
recommendations to guide a congressional cybersecurity oversight reboot.
Cybersecurity is a broad challenge spanning many disciplines and
industries. This paper argues that [the current "patchwork" legal
framework is ill suited]{.underline} to address cybersecurity questions
either for legislative oversight or effective policymaking. The paper
provides an overview of the nature and scope of the cybersecurity
problem, with a focus on how the complexity of the field affects
congressional oversight activities. [Congress has been conducting a
substantial amount of oversight in this area in recent years. Those
efforts, however, have not yet resulted in legislative actions that have
demonstrably improved national cybersecurity]{.underline}. This paper
seeks to aid the effort to craft legal authorities that deal with an
increasingly complex set of cyberthreats. This short exposition provides
a path to rebooting Congress' approach to cybersecurity oversight in a
way that would allow these issues to be addressed more comprehensively.
[Cybersecurity is a complex, integrated challenge spanning topics as
diverse as (but not limited to) international affairs, national security
and defense, criminal law, civil liability, data protection, privacy and
personal responsibility.]{.underline} Cybersecurity also involves many
different actors, ranging from governments to companies to organizations
to individuals. And it involves virtually every type of computing and
information technology in use today, representing a plethora of
technologies far more diverse than the personal computers and servers of
yesteryear. Thus, [perhaps the greatest challenge of developing a
comprehensive cybersecurity governance framework is the fact that it is
a highly complex problem, pervasive and interrelated across many aspects
of government, the private sector, and society.]{.underline} From a
federal government perspective, cybersecurity presents a set of
interrelated challenges. Cybersecurity responses to malign cyber
activities of hostile nation-states cannot be resolved the same way
traditional kinetic defense threats would be handled. For example,
cybersecurity cannot just be handed off to one agency, such as the
Department of Defense (DoD) or the Department of Homeland Security
(DHS). Although those departments play important roles, neither can---as
a result of limits on legal authorities and their appropriate roles and
responsibilities--- address the problem comprehensively. [The current
"patchwork" legal framework is ill suited to address cybersecurity
questions either for legislative oversight or effective
policymaking.]{.underline} Most commonly, the term cybersecurity refers
to some type of defensive technical security problem. Its meaning varies
both descriptively and normatively across industrial sectors, types of
actors, and disciplinary backgrounds. In reality, however, cybersecurity
problems generally describe only one piece of a complex puzzle. The lack
of a framework for defining these issues diminishes the ability of
policymakers to create policy that adequately addresses the full
spectrum of cybersecurity problems. This spectrum is broad and is not
limited to traditional defensive boundaries. It includes strategic and
adversarial planning and operations, spanning parties from private
sector targets to law enforcement to military operations. In a fully
internetworked world of connected appliances, vehicles, Internet of
Things devices, and mobile devices, holistic consideration of
cybersecurity questions is necessary. This discussion takes an expansive
view of the elements that impact "cybersecurity"--- ranging from
technical aspects of system security to principles of international law
in the context of armed conflict. This wide view is unified by the theme
of efforts to improve the health of the U.S. information and computing
infrastructure as an empirical matter, agnostic of any particular
normative policy prescription of consumer protection, economic policy,
or related issues. [The technological aspects of cybersecurity further
complicate this problem in two ways. First, they create a degree of
opacity for nontechnologists in understanding key elements of the
problem. Second, the highly technical nature of cybersecurity lends
itself to the false belief that technical measures can provide complete
solutions. Nothing could be further from the truth.]{.underline} Indeed,
solutions focusing on technological "silver bullets" often are
beneficial to adversaries because of the false sense of security they
provide. Many of the most effective methods of "hacking" often rely on
human vectors. Just as a technological perimeter is an infeasible system
in an interconnected world, a cyber border defended by the Armed Forces
is impractical.

**[The lack of congressional oversight of offensive cyber operations
under the Intelligence Authorization Act also likely does not seriously
shift the balance between congressional and executive war-making
powers]{.underline}**. The reason is inherent in the limitations of the
legislation itself: the Intelligence Authorization Act specifies
reporting requirements, but does not require the non-use or withdrawal
of forces.234 Further, these reports must be made in a "timely" fashion
(the definition of which is undefined) and only to a small number of
Congressmen (at most eight).235 [**Thus even if the President had to
report offensive cyber operations to Congress, it is unclear he would
have to do so in a way that gave Congress an effective
check**,]{.underline} [as these reports would be made only to a small
group of Congressmen (who would not be able to share the information,
because of its classified nature, with other members of the
legislature]{.underline}) and could be done well after the employment of
these capabilities. The resulting picture is one of increased
presidential flexibility; the War Powers Resolution and the Intelligence
Authorization Act---while arguably ineffective in many
circumstances---provide increased congressional oversight of
presidential war-making actions such as troop deployments and covert
actions[. Yet these statutes do not cover offensive cyber operations,
giving the President an increasingly powerful foreign policy tool
outside congressional reach.]{.underline}

Finally and, for my purposes, most significant, [party polarization
contributes to the rise of presidential unilateralism]{.underline}.
[When the Congress is polarized, members of the President\'s party are

Congress is divided, members of the President\'s party will resist any
opposition party efforts to repudiate the President. More than that,
since divided government is increasingly common]{.underline} (thirty of
the past forty years), it is also increasingly difficult for Congress to
enact significant legislation. As such, [Presidents have even more
incentive to act unilaterally-since they cannot get Congress to enact
their legislative agenda]{.underline} Consider, for example, Bill
Clinton\'s health care reforms and George W. Bush\'s faith-based
initiatives. In both instances, [the President went to Congress seeking
legislative authorization for his policy agenda. In both cases, Congress
did not bite, leaving it to the President either to abandon his policy
initiative or pursue his initiative through unilateral
action.]{.underline} Clinton did so by issuing several directives that,
among other things, \"established a patient\'s bill of rights for
federal employees . . . and set penalties for companies that deny health
coverage to the poor and people with pre-existing medical
conditions.\"51 [Bush]{.underline} likewise [acted
unilaterally]{.underline}, establishing the White House Office of Faith
Based Initiatives and ordering an audit of government agencies to make
sure that their practices did not improperly discourage or forbid
faith-based organizations.5 2 [Political polarization]{.underline},
moreover, [encourages Presidents to act unilaterally and take greater
control of the administrative state.]{.underline} Specifically[, with
political polarization and divided government shifting the locus of
government policymaking away from lawmaking and towards executive and
administrative action, Presidents]{.underline} (beginning with Ronald
Reagan) [have used the Office of Management and Budget to review agency
policymaking]{.underline}.53 Likewise, in an effort to ensure that
agency policymaking conforms to the President\'s policy agenda[,
Presidents]{.underline} (again beginning with Ronald Reagan) [have made
use of signing statements and pre-regulatory directives.]{.underline}54
[Finally, Presidents have used their appointments power to ensure agency
loyalty to the President\'s agenda]{.underline}.55 More than any
President before him, George W. Bush pushed the boundaries of
presidential unilateralism. \"What almost no one disputes,\" wrote Adam
Liptak in The New York Times, \"is that a central legacy of the Bush
presidency will be its distinctively muscular vision of executive
power.\" 56 The architect of this campaign was Vice President Dick
Cheney. 7 A witness to Watergate and its aftermath, Cheney helped staff
the \"White House with conservative veterans of the 1970s and 1980s who
believed that\" the President should push his agenda \"without having to
compromise\" and that Watergate-era reforms had wrongly \"emasculated
the presidency.\"\'5 8 More to the point, just as the Nixon
administration pushed the boundaries of executive power, the Bush
administration extended the efforts of Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton to
assert broad inherent power over national security, to [make use of
executive orders to unilaterally advance policy objectives, and to
centralize presidential control of the administrative
state]{.underline}. To cite a few well known examples: [the assertion of
the power to indefinitely detain so-called enemy combatants, the
establishment of a military tribunal system without formal congressional
approval, the warrantless wiretapping of U.S. citizens, the robust use
of executive privilege, and the expansive use of presidential signing
statements to direct agency policymaking-including agency
non-enforcement of laws that the President deems
unconstitutional.]{.underline}

The interview was a rough listen: two political allies frustrated with
each other and with the reality that accountability in Washington, D.C.,
is hard. Hugh Hewitt seemed to think that a subpoena from Chairman Ron
Johnson's committee to James Comey would force the former FBI Director
to confess his role in an attempted coup on President Donald Trump---if
Johnson only had the guts to issue it. [Johnson seemed to think that he
was powerless to force more transparency on the issues that concern
Hewitt and his conservative radio audience. Both are
mistaken]{.underline}. [Similar conversations are often heard on the
other side of the political spectrum too, as the base of each party
demands that the subject of the latest outrage be "hauled" up to Capitol
Hill and "grilled" under the TV lights. Except that almost never
works.]{.underline} From Ollie North 33 years ago to Bill Barr three
weeks ago, it hardly ever goes well for the committee or satisfies the
base voters hungry for red meat. [Sally Yates versus Lindsey Graham is
another recent example. This model of congressional
hearing---confronting a lone hostile witness---has an awful track
record. It should be obvious why. Who's going to do most of the talking?
The witness chews up most of the clock arguing with the premise of
hostile questions from one side of the aisle and fielding soft balls
from allies on the other. By contrast, in a well-designed hearing, a
majority of the witnesses testify to facts that the majority of the
committee wants to highlight. At its best, a congressional hearing tells
a story with friendly witnesses]{.underline}. Victims and whistleblowers
should outnumber villains. And a credible, neutral figure, like an
inspector general or subject matter expert, can refute any disingenuous
political spin. But [even a well-designed hearing is a bad way to gather
facts.]{.underline} That's not its purpose. The hearing comes after
doing the hard work behind the scenes. [That means first scouring reams
of documents and questioning key witnesses with trained, professional
interrogators who don't need to play to the cameras for sound bites.
It's not sexy, but it's effective.]{.underline} Unfortunately, too many
judge the success of oversight by the amount of press coverage rather
than the facts uncovered. [The media and Members alike prefer the
dopamine of the confrontation over data. These one-witness show trials,
where politicians grandstand and berate a single "target" witness simply
don't work, no matter how much people might want them for the
entertainment value or how much a chairman might fancy himself as Perry
Mason]{.underline}. If Senator Johnson could subpoena James Comey to
appear on Hugh Hewitt's radio program, it would be quite a show even
though we probably wouldn't learn much. Comey has already testified
multiple times on Trump-Russia issues. Of course, Hugh Hewitt doesn't
have to yield half of his time to adversaries like Kamala Harris on the
other side. Senator Johnson does. Outside critics like Hewitt are right
to be frustrated with how ineffective congressional oversight has
become. However, [they need to understand the process, study the
procedural limitations that committee chairmen face, and work
constructively to support reforms that could make a real
difference.]{.underline} Sometimes [the problem]{.underline} is lack of
guts, but [more often, it's a lack of experience, procedural tools, and
the expertise to use them.]{.underline} A subpoena is not a magic
bullet. In the modern era, [Congress has essentially forgotten how to
enforce them. It abandoned the historical practice of using its inherent
constitutional authority to impose consequences directly on witnesses
who are in contempt]{.underline}. Now, it turns to the Executive or
Judicial Branches for help rather than standing up for itself and the
people it's elected to represent. [Reclaiming the Legislative Branch's
proper role as the First Branch of government would mean re-learning the
full scope of its own authorities and summoning the political will to
use them.]{.underline} It would mean allocating resources to recruit and
retain more senior, more experienced staff---or failing that,
contracting with top-notch outside professionals to help do battle with
the legal talent arrayed against it. [The most effective practitioners
of legislative oversight have been long-serving, career
legislators]{.underline}---like John Dingell and my former boss, Chuck
Grassley---who stay close to their constituents back home while devoting
significant time and staff resources to the job of acting as a check and
balance on the Executive Branch. Too few aspire to be like Dingell and
Grassley. Too many Members and staff see their time on Capitol Hill as
just a stepping stone to something bigger and better, and it shows.
[Rather than just cursing the problem, critics could help by focusing on
solutions. There are organizations working to strengthen the Legislative
Branch to serve the people it represents more effectivel]{.underline}y.
If you are concerned about countering the permanent, unelected
bureaucracy in Washington, then you should join them in working for a
stronger, more competent Congress.

At least [since Watergate, if not for longer, the executive branch has
recognized the important role congressional oversight plays in the
constitutional system and has understood itself to have a constitutional
obligation to accommodate legitimate oversight requests from
Congress]{.underline}. This long-standing executive branch perspective
is embodied in a 1982 memorandum to all agency heads regarding how to
respond to congressional requests, often referred to as the Reagan memo.
[This memorandum, which remains in force, explicitly states that it is
executive branch policy "to comply with congressional requests for
information to the fullest extent consistent with the constitutional and
statutory obligations of the Executive Branch."]{.underline} While the
Reagan memo recognizes there may be times when it is necessary to
withhold information to protect important executive branch
confidentiality interests, [it emphasizes the expectation that such
impasses should be rare and limited to "compelling circumstances."
Instead, the Reagan memo underscores the importance of engaging in a
good faith negotiation to accommodate the interests of both branches:
"Historically, good faith negotiations between Congress and the
Executive Branch have minimized the need for invoking executive
privilege, and this tradition of accommodation should continue as the
primary means of resolving conflicts between the Branches."]{.underline}
This process of good faith negotiation has become known as the
accommodation process. To be sure, in nearly every administration since
the Reagan memo, there have been a handful of contentious issues where a
dispute between Congress and the executive branch regarding access to
executive branch information reached a high-profile impasse. These
instances of interbranch conflict have been controversial matters that
garnered significant media coverage and public interest. But [the
salience of these occasional instances of conflict should not obscure
the extent to which the branches have been able to resolve the vast
majority of disputes through good faith engagement in the accommodation
process. Every year Congress issues hundreds if not thousands of
oversight requests to the White House and executive branch agencies. Yet
the number of disputes that reach the level of public consciousness in a
presidential term can usually be counted on one hand. This is because in
most oversight matters, the branches reach a reasonable accommodation,
which often includes some disclosure of agency information arguably
subject to a potential executive privilege claim, and thus avoid impasse
and escalation.]{.underline} [This approach to accommodation is not
driven just by policy but also by recognition of a constitutional
obligation to seek such reasonable accommodations]{.underline}. The U.S.
Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit has explained this constitutional
mandate in a manner worth quoting at length in light of present
circumstances: The framers \... expect\[ed\] that where conflicts in
scope of authority arose between the coordinate branches, a spirit of
dynamic compromise would promote the resolution of the dispute in the
manner most likely to result in efficient and effective functioning of
our governmental system. Under this view, the coordinate branches do not
exist in an exclusively adversarial relationship to one another when a
conflict in authority arises. Rather, each branch should take cognizance
of an implicit constitutional mandate to seek optimal accommodation
through a realistic evaluation of the needs of the conflicting branches
in the particular fact situation. \* \* \* \[Because\] it was a
deliberate feature of the constitutional scheme to leave the allocation
of powers unclear in certain situations, the resolution of conflict
between the coordinate branches in these situations must be regarded as
an opportunity for a constructive modus vivendi, which positively
promotes the functioning of our system. The Constitution contemplates
such accommodation. Negotiation between the two branches should thus be
viewed as a dynamic process affirmatively furthering the constitutional
scheme. In 1981, [Reagan's attorney general described the essence of
this process:]{.underline} "The accommodation required is not simply an
exchange of concessions or a test of political strength. [It is an
obligation of each branch to make a principled effort to acknowledge,
and if possible to meet, the legitimate needs of the other branch."
There are important ramifications of recognizing a constitutionally
based obligation to engage in a serious and good faith effort to reach a
reasonable accommodation when there is a disagreement between the
branches]{.underline}. Every executive branch official swears an oath to
uphold the Constitution upon taking office, and this commitment should
be understood to include the constitutional mandate to engage in good
faith to seek reasonable accommodations.

### 1AR\-\--Ukraine Thumper

#### Ukraine spending destroys oversight now 

**Harrigan 6/16**
\[https://reason.com/2022/06/16/the-u-s-is-spending-130-million-a-day-on-military-aid-for-ukraine-without-meaningful-congressional-oversight/\]//LP

[Yesterday the Biden administration announced that it would send an
additional \$1 billion in military aid to Ukraine as the country
continues to combat invading Russian forces.]{.underline} The new aid
package comes on the heels of The Wall Street Journal reporting earlier
this week that the U.S. is now \"sending roughly \$130 million a day in
military aid to Ukraine plus economic and other assistance.\" [American
financial support for Ukraine has largely been uncontroversial in
Congress. Lawmakers approved a \$40 billion aid package in May, adding
billions of dollars to the money President Joe Biden originally
requested.]{.underline} \"The leaders of both parties raised few
questions about how much money was being spent or what it would be used
for,\" wrote The New York Times. Just 11 senators voted against the
bill\'s passage as it breezed through Congress. One of them, [Sen. Rand
Paul (R--Ky.), drew criticism from both parties for delaying Senate
approval of the \$40 billion package after expressing concern that
Congress was \"trying yet again to ram through a spending bill\" and had
failed to outline oversight mechanisms]{.underline}. [Paul
unsuccessfully sought to add language to the bill appointing an
inspector general to supervise the spending.]{.underline} Meanwhile,
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R--Ky.) emphasized the need to
get help to Ukraine \"right now,\" and Senate Majority Leader Chuck
Schumer (D--N.Y.) charged that Paul \"doesn\'t want to aid Ukraine.\"
Unfortunately[, those arguments are helping lawmakers avoid important
debates about the amount and nature of aid the U.S. is sending to
Ukraine, as well as the potential for future misuse as billions of
fast-passed dollars flood into a war zone without proper
over]{.underline}sight. [American politicians have chosen a risky course
of action and are neglecting to realistically discuss the U.S. role in
this conflict]{.underline}. [American officials told The Wall Street
Journal that they have \"little direct knowledge\" of where equipment
goes once it reaches the Ukrainian government]{.underline}. [One
military aid component of the May package, totaling \$6 billion, is a
transfer account that Congress doesn\'t have strong control
over.]{.underline} \"The statutory language requires that \[the
Department of Defense\] report to Congress 15 days before any transfers
occur,\" explains the Center for Strategic International Studies.
\"Congress could block such transfers, but that is difficult to do
politically and procedurally.\" [Oversight experts warn that issues
surrounding transfers are inevitable. \"Even if it\'s a noble cause,
there\'s going to be theft. There\'s going to be
misconduc]{.underline}t,\" warned Special Inspector General for
Afghanistan Reconstruction John Sopko, whose office has uncovered
rampant misuse of U.S. funds that took place during nation-building
efforts in Afghanistan. \"[If there\'s one thing we learned from
Afghanistan, you\'ve got to have oversight in the beginning.\" Many
components of the May package and other aid installments deserve more
scrutiny from lawmakers than they have received. Not-insignificant
chunks of money are going toward countering \"Russian disinformation and
propaganda narratives,\" bolstering the Department of Justice\'s
\"efforts to pursue high value asset seizures from sanctioned
individuals]{.underline},\" paying the salaries of Ukrainian government
officials, and prepping munitions for military skirmishes that aren\'t
related to the conflict in Ukraine. In rushing the passage of aid,
Congress has neglected to debate whether these are appropriate spending
priorities for the U.S.---especially, as Paul notes, when the American
economy is already in such bad shape. [And there\'s a deeper, more
conflict-relevant concern at hand. The end goals for U.S. assistance are
still murky, even as American politicians repeat their opposition to
Russian aggression and support for Ukraine regaining its territory and
sovereignty]{.underline}. Rajan Menon, director of the Grand Strategy
program at Defense Priorities and a professor at the City College of New
York, argues that the U.S. must determine what its precise aims are in
order to shape responsible policy. Without establishing clear
objectives, politicians can shift the goal posts and more easily justify
staying involved. Menon asks, for instance, whether the eventual goal is
to restore Ukrainian borders to their pre-2022 state or if it\'s to
reclaim Crimea. \"[The latter is...ambitious, it\'s far more dangerous,
and it will make the war even longer than \[it\] otherwise will
be]{.underline},\" Menon explains. \"[To say...this is all up to Ukraine
to decide is to overlook the fact that we are its principal arms
supplier and therefore are deeply implicated in this war.
K]{.underline}yiv is certainly entitled to make its choices but that
doesn\'t release us from the obligation to make our one.\" In eschewing
proper debate over military aid to Ukraine, American lawmakers are
opting out of an uncomfortable---but necessary---conversation. \"If we
ramp up arms supplies to Ukraine, which is already urgently calling for
more, we should take into account that Russia may at some point treat us
as a co-belligerent,\" Menon points out. \"Simply assuming that that
would be a bridge too far for them would be a mistake.\" U.S.
politicians need to discuss the line not to be crossed before America is
effectively acting as a co-combatant rather than allowing Russia to make
that determination itself. Providing military aid to Ukraine strikes
many Americans as the right move. It might seem like the best available
option, given that alternatives include putting American boots on the
ground or securing a no-fly zone over Ukrainian airspace---both of which
would prove disastrous. [But those impulses don\'t relieve U.S.
lawmakers of their responsibility to ensure aid is being directed toward
appropriate uses and being used properly. To willingly avoid those
discussions all but ensures that the war in Ukraine will be another
conflict involving fiscal irresponsibility on America\'s
part.]{.underline}

As the Senate works to pass the almost \$40 billion in emergency
supplemental funds for Ukraine just passed by the House, leaders in
Washington must also ensure proper oversight of this spending. They can
and must do both quickly. [The Biden administration and Senate must also
prioritize installing permanent inspectors general to government
agencies so they can monitor aid to Ukraine. These independent watchdogs
can ensure that taxpayer money is not siphoned off by fraudsters or war
profiteers and that weapons remain in the hands of the Ukrainian
military]{.underline}. [The simplest route would be to install permanent
inspectors general at existing offices tasked with doling out the aid
and ensure those offices have the resources they need to oversee surge
funding like]{.underline} this. The Pentagon and State Department, the
two agencies overseeing the bulk of spending for Ukraine assistance, are
both missing permanent internal watchdogs --- and the Pentagon has been
missing one for over six years [The need for effective inspectors
general is already apparent given the level and nature of U.S.
assistance committed to Ukraine]{.underline}. [The speed at which the
U.S. has transferred this defense material to the country presents real
oversight challenges in terms of both spending and monitoring its
use.]{.underline} Oversight and monitoring of arms transfers are
generally difficult in the first place, but [without U.S. personnel on
the ground in Ukraine, something we do not advocate for, it's even more
challenging to monitor whether U.S. arms are staying in the hands of the
Ukrainian military. The]{.underline} State and [Defense Departments
desperately need internal watchdogs to prevent, detect and investigate
abuse of funds as well as ineffective or insufficient tracking of
weapons by the agencies' respective monitoring programs.]{.underline}

[There is an **overlap** between **DOS** and **DOD** when it comes to

Former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates helped popularize the term
"shared responsibility" regarding SC/SA as it refers to the joint
responsibility between DOD and DOS in supporting U.S. foreign SC/SA
programs, relationships overseas, and national security interests.89
According to ADP 1, the DOD's role is to deter enemies, counter threats,
and fight and win the nation's wars. [The DOS is responsible for
**foreign policy** and U.S. **diplomatic relations**]{.underline}.
[DOS's role in the shared responsibility of SC]{.underline}/SA programs
[is to calculate and measure **associated trade-offs**]{.underline}

Security cooperation is often behind the news we read at night but
rarely the frontline story. Luckily [we're]{.underline} also [blessed
with another influential group that **cares deeply**]{.underline} [about
security cooperation]{.underline} -- the **[Congress]{.underline}**. [In
FY **'17** Congress undertook the **largest**]{.underline}, **[most
sweeping]{.underline}**, [and **most substantial** reforms to
**s**ecurity **c**ooperation in our nation's history]{.underline}.
[The]{.underline} FY '17 [NDAA **consolidated** dozens of authorities
into a narrow band of activities]{.underline} in Chapter 16. [It set up
requirements for **human rights vetting**]{.underline}, [**institutional
capacity building**, and assessment **monitoring** and
**evaluation**]{.underline}.

With lots of work in the trenches by both DOD and Congress, this all hit
at once, and it was welcome. Implementing an ambitious vision remains a
challenge, particularly for those activities that were funded out of
service accounts or regional initiatives. Many security cooperation
activities were not being looked at holistically across the spectrum.
Programs were siloed and oversight sometimes limited.

[Congress believed that the entire system needed
**oversight**]{.underline} from a single executor with visibility across
all the authorities and all the different pots of money. This is how we
got the Title 10, Chapter 16, Section 382 in the U.S. Code. The notion
that the secretary's designee, the undersecretary of defense for policy
-- my immediate boss -- shall have, quote, "the responsibility for the
oversight of strategic policy guidance and the responsibility of overall
resource allocation for security cooperation programs and activities of
the Department of Defense." End quote.

[This is where we are]{.underline} trying to go with security
cooperation: [a **holistic** DOD-wide enterprise with visibility across
the spectrum of security cooperation activities, administered with
policy **oversight**, and **aligned tightly** to strategy]{.underline}.

How we define security cooperation is changing as well. At one point
security cooperation meant -- basically meant train and equip programs.
We're moving away from that. Security cooperation enterprise now
encompasses everything from equipment, to training, to conventional arms
sales, to exercises with both high-end and developing partners.

Meanwhile, [we are prioritizing **interoperability**]{.underline} [and
making arms sales **quicker** and more **efficient**]{.underline}. In
the last 10 years the department has reduced the average time to process
foreign military sales by 30 percent. And I know our colleagues at DSCA
are working hard to streamline things even more.

[We are also trying to **move off** of year-to-year
planning]{.underline}. My office has been involved in a push over the
last two years to align security cooperation planning with planning,
programming, budgeting, and execution cycle as well as the global force
management cycle, planning two years out from the current fiscal year.

Further, [we are]{.underline} trying to look at security cooperation
programs as more life-cycle events, [planning **five years out** from
conception, evaluating them annually, and ensuring that security
cooperation activities are built with **specific
achievable**]{.underline}, **[measurable]{.underline}** [objectives in
mind]{.underline}. We're also looking at how to make our investments
sustainable and effective. A big part of this revolves around
institutional capacity building using our experience as a department to
help partners develop their defense ministry apparatus. We are still
working on the best ways to do this, but this is critical to our
mission. Merely transferring equipment or providing training is
insufficient if the partner military lacks the professional and
bureaucratic apparatus to effectively absorb and employ their
capabilities.

One tool that has helped us cover down and provide engagement in this
field has been our regional centers. We have five of them. The George C.
Marshall Center in Germany is just one example. Last week they held an
important and timely conference on Ukrainian defense reform efforts.
Engagements such as these are valuable, and they're not very expensive.
The regional centers provide an excellent example of how small
investments can yield high returns over time.

The state partnership program has also proved a cost-effective,
small-footprint tool for supporting security cooperation goals of the
geographic combatant commands and our diplomatic community. Over the
last 24 years, we have established 73 partnerships with 79 countries
across all six geographic commands. These partnerships have brought
diplomatic and military engagement via the national guard elements
resulting in individual, professional, and institutional contacts and
relationships, enhancing influence and trust on a worldwide basis.
