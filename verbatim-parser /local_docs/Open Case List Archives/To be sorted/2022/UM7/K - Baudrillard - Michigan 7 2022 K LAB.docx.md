Exercise scenario. The technical scenario, describing the
interdependencies, attack vectors, and alternative paths, only covers
the part for the actual work to be conducted by the exercise
participants. To deliver the context, reasoning, and clear objectives,
the overarching scenario is required. This scenario provides the
elements, such as, the state-of-the-world background, geo-political
situation, intelligence information on what has happened, what is the
impact suffered, why the response is being triggered, what are the
objectives and rules of engagement. [The main geo-political story
revolves around a]{.underline} fictitious [group of Cyberbian
islands]{.underline}, where every island is a country with its
technological advancements, political stance, alliances, and intentions.
The three island-countries are Berylia, Crimsonia, and Revalia. [Berylia
being the smallest with a modest military force, part of NATO alliance,
and its main economic income originating from the electronics
manufacturing. Crimsonia is the largest island with a strong military,
rich in natural resources, not part of any alliance, and is expressing
some signs of aggression against its neighbouring
island-countries.]{.underline} Revalia is a small, self-sustained, and
politically neutral country. Within the scenario, the exercise
participants assume the role of [Berylian rapid response
team,]{.underline} which [is assembled to address the looming crisis,
maintain the resiliency of the national critical information
infrastructure, and accomplish the mission goals]{.underline}. Every
year, with a new exercise edition, the scenario evolves and **[the
[tensions between Berylia and Crimsonia have been escalating, ranging
from Crimsonia conducting]{.mark} a series of [debilitating cyber
attacks against Berylian Critical Information
Infrastructure]{.mark}]{.underline}** (CII), **[[abuse of a neutral
nation infrastructure for operation conduct, placing insiders and
double-agents, forming military blockades, up to launching a military
invasion]{.mark} of Berylia.]{.underline}** The various levels of
conflict are designed to explore the technical, cyber-kinetic, and legal
game-plays as every particular state opens new opportunities and
provides flexibility in conducting the responsive computer network
operations. The operational environment for the kinetic force's unit is
extremely important, as this restricts, or enables, some types of
activities to be exercised.

Legal considerations. A part of the exercise scenario consists of legal
game-play. Despite the exercise not having legal aspects as the primary
objectives, the legal guidance and considerations are incorporated in
the form of legal scenario injects aimed to trigger the discussion and
legal implication consideration during the situational report meetings.

Legal advisers are assigned to every level of the chain-of-command to
assess and consult the exercise participants. The legal aspects of the
conducted cyber-kinetic operations and applied TTTPs, within the context
of the scenario, tackle at least the following legal considerations as
covered in Publication VIII: 1. Applicable law (Part II). Depending on
the circumstances ruling at the time, the lawyers are tasked to
ascertain which regimes of public international law apply to the cyber
operations occurring during the exercise. The cyber attack campaigns of
the exercise range from those occurring in peacetime to those
endangering national and international security. The storyline generally
avoids situations of armed conflict. The exercise scenario attempts to
bring all of the five operational domains (i.e., land, sea, air, space,
and cyber) into the game-play, extended by espionage, and cyber-kinetic
operations. Such activities may be addressed by the international human
rights law, diplomatic and consular law, law of the sea, air law, space
law, and international telecommunications law; 2. States entitled to
take countermeasures (Rule 24). Only state affiliated institutions and
organizations, such as, military or intelligence, can conduct responsive
activities on the state's behalf as long as the activities they engage
in do not constitute an internationally wrongful act. The cyber
operations by private entities, such as, business companies or
non-governmental organizations (NGO), can never constitute
countermeasures in the legal sense. Therefore, the players assume the
role of a rapid response team, assembled on the order of Berylian
government, which is placed under the supervision of the military
command; 3. Effect of RCD on third parties (Rule 25). Due to the fact
that RCD has extraterritorial nature and implicates pursuing the
adversary, as well as, performing malicious service take-down within the
cyberspace, the legal advisers are required to assess the legality of
the RCD effects on the third parties. These activities may include
operations, such as, third-party Virtual Private Server (VPS) take-over,
hacking adversary controlled CnC servers on the Internet, back-dooring
or re-weaponizing the malicious code used by the adversary and
compromising public web services to plant the targeted exploit-kits.
Since such operations are intentional, both from the adversary and
defender side, they have an effect on third-party owned systems or
against ones residing in a neutral state (i.e., Revalia). For the red
team to complete their mission objectives, the RCD activities have to be
deemed lawful, the various possible paths have to be explored, their
effects evaluated, and necessary precautions taken, if such are
reasonably possible; 4. Limitations on RCD (Rules 23, 26, 72, 73, 113).
Depending on the legal qualification of the RCD operations, various
limitations, such as, concerning necessity, proportionality, imminence
and immediacy, are attached to this operation. The [legal advisers are
tasked to identify any applicable limitations]{.underline}, such as,
[requirements for]{.underline} the RCD \[[Responsive Cyber
Defense]{.underline}\] [to be necessary and proportionate]{.underline},
and [provide]{.underline} these [legal implications]{.underline} to the
commander or sub-team leaders. The scenario addresses both the [cyber
and kinetic [attacks]{.mark}]{.underline} and activities performed by
the adversary against the defended state and its CII. [Those [include
malicious]{.mark} operations, such as, serious [cyber attacks,
espionage, sabotage, and deployment of malware]{.mark}]{.underline}
(e.g., condition-activated logic-bombs) [[with the goal to debilitate
the state's critical services and capabilities]{.mark}. Adversary's
kinetic activities include operations, such as, [armed drone attacks,
navy blockades, placement of]{.mark} a large amount of [troops on the
borders, and expeditionary force deployment.]{.mark}]{.underline} The
game-play is initiated by the series of [[escalating events
lead]{.mark}ing [to]{.mark} ongoing or [imminent
threat]{.mark}]{.underline}, which may [serve to prove the necessity of
the taken responsive operations,]{.underline} which are evaluated by
their proportionality and delivered effect. As derived from the
scenario, [[the defending state has to **immediately respond**]{.mark}
to an ongoing or imminent threat [to]{.mark} ensure the
[]{.mark}resiliency and [protect]{.mark}ion of [critical assets relevant
to]{.mark} the [security, functionality and well-being]{.mark} of the
state]{.underline}; 5. Self-defence against an armed attack (Rule 71).
The scenario is designed in such a manner that [[the severity offensive
action]{.mark} against the victim state [amounts to **an armed
attack**]{.mark}, thus [permitting]{.mark} to respond in [self-defence
with an **immediate asymmetric responsive cyber operations against a
stronger and advanced adversary**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The scenario can
be designed more subtle and with less tensions, however, in such case
the training audience would struggle proving the necessity to pursue the
adversary and infiltrate their network, which would have an impact on
the overall game-play and achieving the currently set mission and
training objectives; 6. Geographical limitations of cyber operations
(Rule 81). The effects of a cyber operations have to be limited to the
intended target information systems and geographical locations. This,
although not always being possible to limit geographically, is taken
into consideration by the red team when executing the cyber operation
which may include the activities, such as, placement of drive-by
exploit-kits on third-party services. The red team might not be aware of
geographical location of a targeted asset in cyberspace, however, when
such attack campaign is executed, measures are taken to restrict its
spread within the intended target's network address ranges if it is
possible; 7. Means and methods of cyber warfare (Part IV, Chapter 17,
Section 5). The exercise scenario plays on the various levels of
aggression and conflicts without entering the state of war. Despite
cyber warfare not being applicable directly it is still to be considered
and applicable methods have to be evaluated accordingly, since, within
[[the]{.underline}]{.mark} played-out [[high-tension
scenario]{.underline}]{.mark}, it [[could **unexpectedly escalate to an
armed conflict and**]{.mark} the state of **[war]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

\*BERM = Berylian Malware

**[[One]{.mark} of the [Berylian region]{.mark}s directly neighbouring
Crimsonia [is historically disputed.]{.mark} Citizens of Berylia living
in this region align themselves with the nationality that is dominant in
Crimsonia.]{.underline}** These citizens organise themselves into a
political organisation, Crimson Home. [[The]{.mark} ultimate [goal of
Crimson Home is cessation from Berylia and incorporation into
Crimsonia]{.mark}]{.underline}. Crimson Home intends to reach this goal
through a political referendum.

**[[For]{.mark} various [reasons, including heightened geopolitical and
regional ambitions, both States are prone to escalation]{.mark} of
conflict through various triggering events of a cyber and non-cyber
nature.]{.underline}** These will be described below. Before the
conflict, [Berylia had developed cyber capabilities to be able to
collect, disrupt and potentially destroy data which adversaries rely
upon. For this purpose, the Berylian government procured and developed
cyber capabilities allowing the delivery of a harmful payload to target
devices. Operators from Berylian law enforcement and armed forces are
able to target specific networks or a specific range of IP addresses.
Malware can be used to infect targeted devices and obtain sufficient
rights to allow the remote delivery of a harmful payload to different
components of an operating system. This payload includes modules
allowing surveillance of communication, tracking of movement, issuance
of counterfeit messages or erasure of data stored on the
device.]{.underline} We will refer to this cyber system as Berylian
Malware (BERM).

4\. STATE VS. CITIZENS

1\) Scenario The first part of our scenario observes a deteriorating
relationship between Berylia and Crimsonia. [Crimson Home, actively
seeking to secede from Berylia, is heavily financed from Crimsonia. The
Crimsonian government, despite numerous allegations, has never admitted
to supporting Crimson Home. However, [finances pouring into Crimson Home
originate]{.mark}, according to Berylian intelligence, [from
Crimsonian]{.mark} companies identified as [shell companies]{.mark} used
by the Crimsonian government.]{.underline} [After [the Berylian
government refuses to hold a referendum]{.mark} in conjunction with
national elections, [Crimson Home heightens its
activity.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[Targeted ads]{.mark} sponsored by
Crimson Home aim to [incite tension]{.mark} between citizens living [in
the disputed region]{.mark} and the central Berylian
government.]{.underline} This eventually leads to a series of rallies
and protests. **[Social [unrest results in]{.mark} small-scale riots,
[localised violence and]{.mark} spontaneous [attacks on election
officials]{.mark} and polls.]{.underline}** No fatalities are reported,
and a number of injured participants is limited to a minimum. Law
enforcement agencies use tear gas to disperse the most stubborn
protesters. This is directly followed by a series of arrests of people
either directly participating in riots or suspected of organising and
inciting them. **[[Crimson Home is targeted by
BERM]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Payload effects include the surveillance of
communications and tracking the movement of high-profile members of the
organization. **[The situation escalates when [Crimson Home members
organise bombings]{.mark} in the disputed region.]{.underline}** These
attacks are aimed mainly at buildings representing the central
government, the legislature and the courts. **[[The death toll]{.mark}
quickly [rises]{.mark}]{.underline}** into the hundreds. This surge of
violence is unprecedented and surprising to the Berylian government.
[Berylia responds by requiring Crimsonia to cease financing Crimson
Home]{.underline}. At the same time, **[[the Berylian government
launches]{.mark} large scale operations involving law enforcement
agencies as well as a limited deployment of Berylian [armed forces in
the]{.mark} disputed [region.]{.mark} Tension]{.underline}** in the
region **[continues to rise.]{.underline}** Crimson Home is further
targeted by BERM. Payloads still conduct surveillance of communication
and tracking of movement. After the bombings, the scale of BERM
deployment is increased, and all known members of Crimson Home are
targeted. 2) Legal Qualification Understandably, any State must be aware
of its human rights obligations stemming from international treaties.
Berylia is obliged to secure rights and freedoms stemming from the ECHR.
Nonetheless, Article 15 of ECHR24 allows derogation from such an
obligation. To achieve this, Berylia needs to determine whether a series
of rallies, protests and riots is 'an exceptional situation of crisis or
emergency, which affects the whole population and constitutes a threat
to the organised life of the community of which the State is
composed'.25 The fact that these events take place only in the disputed
region is not an obstacle because **['a crisis which concerns only a
particular region of the State can amount to a public emergency
threatening "the life of the nation"'.]{.underline}**26 **[The
determination of]{.underline}** the situation as **[a state of emergency
is left to the State]{.underline}** as a matter of margin of
appreciation.27 A State is not allowed to go beyond what is strictly
required by the exigencies of the situation. Whether surveillance of
communication and tracking of movement of high-profile members of an
organisation complies with this requirement may be assessed against a
set of factors based on judicial decisions of the European Court of
Human Rights.28 Assessment of the deployment of BERM when the situation
escalates might be [clearer if Berylia determines such acts as
terrorism]{.underline}, as [terrorism meets the standard of a public
emergency]{.underline}.29 There are also other requirements, but their
in-depth analysis is not relevant to this scenario. Therefore, prior to
deployment of BERM, Berylia should ensure that its actual deployment
will not violate the human rights of its citizens. This could be done by
conducting a legal review of BERM against relevant legal obligations and
possible derogations in a state of emergency. It is worth noting that
clauses similar to Article 15 of ECHR exist within the International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (Article 4) and the American
Charter on Human Rights (Article 17).

5\. STATE VS. STATE A. Sovereignty

1\) Scenario Our scenario follows further escalation. [Despite Berylia's
freezing bank accounts of the Crimson Home and its high-profile members
as a part of ongoing counter-terrorism operation, Berylian intelligence
confirms that Crimsonia has not stopped financing Crimson
Home]{.underline}. Financing is now provided by couriers crossing the
border from Crimsonia with large sums of cash. **[Berylian [intelligence
reports]{.mark} a strong suspicion that [weapons are]{.mark} also being
[transported]{.mark} to Berylia [as the Crimsonia]{.mark}n government
[strengthens]{.mark} its [support for Crimson
Home.]{.mark}]{.underline}** BERM is deployed to target any device that
connects to specific cell towers located near the border. Payload
activities include the surveillance of communication and of movement.
However, selected individuals are targeted by harmful payloads allowing
suppression of outgoing communication from their devices.

2\) Legal qualification Interstate relations come into consideration at
this point. **[[With couriers crossing borders]{.mark} with cash and
potentially [with weapons, Berylia might]{.mark}]{.underline}** decide
**[to [consider this]{.mark} situation as [a violation of]{.mark} its
[sovereignty.]{.mark}]{.underline}** It seems appropriate to refer to
the well-known Island of Palmas arbitral award where a definition of
sovereignty was proposed,30 the basic components of which were further
developed in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter with key components of
territorial integrity and political independence. Berylia might also
consider whether to perceive sovereignty as a rule or as a principle.
This is still a matter of debate, not only in academia,31 but also in
state practice.32 It is important to note that Berylia needs to
attribute the conduct of couriers to the Crimsonian authorities, as only
States can violate sovereignty. The first act of violation of
sovereignty deals with the territorial aspect. When a person physically
crosses the borders with money and weapons, the involvement of state
authorities is more likely than when done virtually by sending money.
Berylia might also focus on alleged Crimsonian interference with
Berylian governmental functions. Even though these events are non-cyber
in nature, **[they further fuel the escalation process]{.underline}**.
If Berylian claims that Crimsonia has violated its sovereignty prove
correct, **[[interstate tension will]{.mark} be
[escalate]{.mark}d]{.underline}**, and the legal background of this
fictional conflict will change. In response**[, [Crimsonia might claim
that the deployment of BERM in the disputed region violates Crimsonian
sovereignty.]{.mark}]{.underline}** [As BERM targets any device
connecting to specific cell towers near the border, it is possible that
the devices of Crimsonian citizens will also be affected]{.underline}.
Therefore, it is important to examine BERM capabilities and possible
targeting issues before deployment. In our scenario, Berylia should
conduct a software review regarding the conditions which Crimsonia may
take into consideration when labelling the deployment of BERM as a
violation of sovereignty. Violation of sovereignty by cyber means
remains an unsettled issue, and the IGE presented three levels which
might be helpful to determine whether a violation of territorial
sovereignty has occurred. These include considerations as to whether
BERM is capable of causing physical damage, loss of functionality or
infringement upon territorial integrity falling below the threshold of
the loss of functionality.33 It is also important whether the deployment
of BERM leads to interference with the inherently governmental functions
of Crimsonia.34

B. Non-Intervention

1\) Scenario With the progression of the Berylian counter-terrorism
operation, Crimson Home quickly depletes its human resources and its
members are arrested or incapacitated as a direct result of actions by
Berylian law enforcement and armed forces. [The border, so far used for
transportation of cash and weapons, is crossed by people willing to join
Crimson Home. Berylian intelligence suggests that these volunteers are
affiliated to Crimsonian paramilitary and military forces]{.underline}.
However, direct and clear evidence is lacking. BERM is deployed to
target devices connecting to specific cell towers located near the
border. The payload still effects mainly surveillance of movement and
surveillance of communication with intended recipients within Crimsonian
territory.

2\) Legal Qualification The principle of non-intervention has very close
ties to sovereignty. It is described as 'a corollary of the principle of
the sovereign equality of States'.35 Non-intervention mainly deals with
the 'decision-making capacity of a State to formulate policies in
relation to its internal and external affairs'.36 The concept of
internal and external affairs is flexible and linked to the notion of
domaine reservé. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) sheds some
light on the definition and has held that States may decide freely on
matters such as 'choice of a political, economic, social and cultural
system, and the formulation of foreign policy'.37 That being said, not
every coercion trying to violate this freedom of choice violates
international law[. Only coercive acts reaching a sufficient level of
magnitude and intending a target State to change its policy are legally
relevan]{.underline}t.38 [However, this threshold is fluid and
context-dependant.]{.underline} **[Berylia might assess whether dozens
of people crossing the border and willing to fight for Crimson Home
constitute a violation of the principle of
non-intervention.]{.underline}** Individuals are not legally capable of
violating the non-intervention principle. Therefore, Berylia should
probably resort to a political attribution and make its suspicion of
affiliation of volunteers to Crimsonian forces public. Berylia should
also take into consideration the context and intent. **[[Crimson
Home]{.mark} sought to secede the region through a referendum and when
denied, it [turned to violence.]{.mark} Ergo, it is pushing for a change
of Berylian policy with regard to the disputed region]{.underline}**. If
the personnel joining Crimson Home intend to force Berylia to change its
position towards the region, it might suffice to establish an unlawful
intervention.

Under international law, **[[Berylia is entitled to]{.mark} engage in
[countermeasures]{.mark}]{.underline}**. As BERM is already deployed, it
might serve the purpose besides the collection of data for intelligence,
counter-intelligence and law enforcement purposes. It would be necessary
to conduct a software review to ascertain whether the use of BERM might
further escalate the conflict by exceeding what are permissible
countermeasures.

C. Use of Force vs. Armed Attack

1\) Scenario While BERM was previously used mainly to gather
intelligence, in response to the violation of its borders Berylia
engages in remote destruction of data on devices carried by people
crossing the border. This leads to loss of data of many innocent
citizens from both Berylia and Crimsonia and large-scale damage to and
destruction of property. According to Berylian intelligence, this
extreme measure was only partially effective in response to Crimson Home
and its affiliates[. [Crimsonia]{.mark} officially and publicly
[denounces the]{.mark} deployment of BERM and the harmful payloads
distributed through the system. The Crimsonian government also announces
that appropriate [measures]{.mark} will be [undertaken]{.mark} in
response.]{.underline} **[[This results in cyber attacks against
Berylian dual use and military infrastructure]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
Most of these attacks are DDoS and ransomware, but [Berylian
intelligence reports that they are serving as decoys for large-scale
intelligence gathering and espionage. The communications of Berylian
forces engaged in ongoing Berylian counter-terrorism operations within
the disputed region are jammed from Crimsonian territory.]{.underline}

2\) Legal Qualification Remote destruction of data escalated the
situation. We argue that **[the Berylian action and Crimsonian reaction
pushed the whole conflict over the threshold of the use of
force,]{.underline}** making it inconsistent with purposes enshrined in
Article 2(4) of the UN Charter. The IGE partially followed the scale and
effects approach laid out by the ICJ,39 and used this approach for the
qualification of the unlawful use of force.40 To ease the qualification,
the IGE also used a set of eight factors41 that outline factual
considerations on whether to consider a given cyber operation as an
unlawful use of force. Despite these factors not being norms of
international law, they do provide basic cues along which to structure
the legal response.42 Before using BERM to deploy payload that might
lead to a violation of the prohibition of the use of force, Berylia
should have conducted a legal review to assess the possible legal
consequences to determine, amongst other things, whether the operation
may lead to violation of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter. Furthermore,
Article 51 of the UN Charter which grants a victim state the option to
respond with force comes into play. Even though the majority of States
perceive the gap between the use of force and an armed attack and
distinguish 'the most grave forms of the use of force (those
constituting an armed attack) from other less grave forms',43 other
approaches also exist in the international community. As Harold Koh said
at the Inter-Agency Legal Conference in 2012, **['the United States has
for a long time taken the position that the inherent right of
self-defence potentially applies against any illegal use of
force]{.underline}**'44 **[and rejected the existence of any
threshold]{.underline}**. The other theory called the accumulation of
events doctrine was originally introduced by Israel in the 1970s and
reflected a situation of terrorist attacks. Israel advocated a position
that even though: 'each specific act of terrorism, or needle prick, may
not qualify as an armed attack that entitles the victim State to respond
legitimately with armed force, the totality of the incidents may
demonstrate a systematic campaign of minor terrorist activities that
does rise to the intolerable level of armed attack.'45

D. Armed Conflict

1\) Scenario Berylian intelligence has obtained conclusive proof that
volunteers crossing the border from Crimsonia are predominantly members
of the Crimsonian armed forces and their activities are being organised
by the Crimsonian government. The Berylian government publicly accuse
Crimsonia of plans to occupy the disputed region by force. **[[Berylia
deploys heavy weaponry]{.mark} to the border region [as a
follow-up]{.mark} to the counter-terrorism operation [against Crimson
Home.]{.mark}]{.underline}** As part of the preparation for potential
conflict, **[[BERM is taken over by the military to ensure]{.mark}
coordination of [intelligence gathering and targeted incapacitation of
devices]{.mark} throughout the disputed region]{.underline}**.
Newly-deployed Berylian forces engage volunteers from Crimsonia. **[As
one of the [Berylian units engage]{.mark}s [Crimson Home]{.mark} members
and volunteers [close to the border, the Crimsonian Air Force
attacks]{.mark} the unit.]{.underline}** As a follow-up, **[[Crimsonia
claims]{.mark} that the [military build-up in the]{.mark} disputed
[region signals a planned invasion]{.mark} by Berylia]{.underline}**.
The Crimsonian government opts to move units across the border to set up
defensive positions on a mountain ridge on Berylian territory. In
response, Berylian units engage the Crimsonian Army to prevent it from
crossing the border to Berylia.

2\) Legal Qualification We deem **[that the last round of [escalation
leads Berylia and Crimsonia into]{.mark} a state of [armed
conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} As a result, the norms of IHL
are triggered. Berylia is, as a signatory to the API, obliged to conduct
a weapons review under Article 36 of API. According to the IGE, all
States, whether they have ratified API or not, are required to ensure
that the means of warfare they acquire or use comply with the rules and
principles of IHL. This obligation is derived from a general duty of
compliance with IHL.46 There are at least two points to highlight the
weapons review process. First, IHL does not mandate States to establish
a general practice of using a weapon before it is to be considered
legal.47 Second, the Commentary to API sheds light on the intent behind
the weapons review. It requires States to determine whether the
employment of a weapon for its expected use could be prohibited under
IHL.48

#### **Scenario planning predicts that Berylia invokes [Article 5]{.underline}. Causes NATO cyberwar.** 

**Al Jazeera 17** (18 Jun, 2017, Jose Miguel Calatayud, "Locked Shields:
the world's biggest cyber-war game",
<https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2017/6/18/locked-shields-the-worlds-largest-cyber-war-game>)

**Tallinn, Estonia --** [Things are bad on the small island nation of
Berylia after a diplomatic row with Crimsonia, its bigger neighbour and
rival. There are street protests by the Crimsonian minority in
[Berylia,]{.mark} which then [suffers a wave of cyber-attacks that make
it lose control of its drones and its only international
airbase.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[Crimsonia is blamed]{.mark} for the cyberoffensive even though there's
no hard proof]{.underline}. Crippled by the attacks,
[**[Berylia,]{.mark}** a new member of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organisation (NATO), [weighs its option]{.mark}s. One of them is **[to
invoke Article 5 and take the]{.mark} military [alliance to
war]{.mark}** [against Crimsonia]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Berylia and Crimsonia are fictional and so is this scenario, which is
part of Locked Shields, a cyberwar game. But the fact that the situation
doesn't sound that far-fetched is one of the reasons why Locked Shields
is so relevant today. Locked Shields is "the world's largest and most
advanced international technical live-fire cyber defence exercise", as
described by the NATO-affiliated Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of
Excellence ([CCDCOE](https://ccdcoe.org/)), which has been organising it
since 2010 in
Tallinn, [Estonia](http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/estonia.html).

This year, the event was organised at a five-star hotel in Tallinn's
city centre in late April. An entire floor of the plush hotel was
dedicated to the cyber games. Everyone was armed with a laptop, monitors
were placed all over the place and a drone hung from the ceiling in the
Control Room where people in white, green and yellow T-shirts mingled.

The White Team is in charge of the scenario and the Green Team is
responsible for the physical and online infrastructure of Locked
Shields, which includes more than 3,000 virtualised systems, some highly
specialised and all mirroring the top IT trends. They operate via
private networks not accessible from the open internet.

The Yellow Team is tasked with situation awareness and the people in red
T-shirts have their own adjacent room: they are the in-game malignant
hackers who will be attacking Berylia, and who in their day jobs are
penetration testers, network and system administrators, cyberthreat
analysts and such.

Many of the participants are CCDCOE staff, and the rest are a mix of
techies and cyber-security experts from the private and public sectors
of 25 countries.

Most are male and aged between their mid-20s and mid-40s, some are
older, some are of obvious military background. There are very few
women: cyberwar, it seems, is still a men's game.

One colour is missing here: that of 19 participating Blue Teams, each
one playing the role of Berylia's Rapid Cyber-Response Team.

All but one are national teams from NATO members and allied countries,
and the remaining one is from the NATO's cybersecurity wing, Computer
Incident Response Capability
([NCIRC](https://www.ncia.nato.int/Our-Work/Pages/Cyber-Security.aspx)).

The Blue Teams usually play from their host countries where they all
start with the same scenario and then follow their own paths as they are
more or less successful at keeping the cyber-attackers at bay. Locked
Shields is a competition: the Blue Teams are scored and at the end
ranked. Last
year [Slovakia](http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/slovakia.html) won
ahead of the NCIRC
and [Finland](http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/finland.html).

After two days of preparations, the exercise was launched on April 26.
The 19 defending teams spread all over Europe woke up to a fake news
story accusing [Berylia of having produced a drone for spraying chemical
weapons.]{.underline}

[This causes protests in Berylia and condemnation by Crimsonia, then the
cyber-attacks begin and immediately]{.underline}, several Blue Teams
have their firewalls compromised by the Red Team hackers in Tallinn.

As long as they remain inside and invisible, the attackers can steal and
modify data, and maybe even control the systems.

In real life, it would not be exactly like this, though.

"During this game, they are giving you the infrastructure to protect web
pages or mailing systems that are already vulnerable. In the real world,
you are protecting your systems on a daily basis," says Klaid Magi,
leader of the Estonian Blue Team, which is playing from a room in the
Estonian Information System Authority, where Magi works as head of the
cybersecurity unit.

Once attackers get inside your systems, havoc may follow, as happens for
some Blue Teams when fuel pumps in their airbase are hacked and spill
their contents, causing a fire. Smoke can be seen and suddenly these
teams start receiving emails and Skype calls from the in-game
journalists in Tallinn.

In the hotel, the Control Room is frantic with people in white, green
and yellow typing, walking around and speaking to each other, mostly in
English and Estonian. However, the room next door where the people in
red are sitting and where the cyberattacks are coming from is eerily
silent and calm.

Playing a game of catch-up

"You need to be very concentrated, it's really distracting if there're
people talking, it's like chess," says a Red Team member who cannot
reveal their name. The way cyberattacks work, the aggressor makes the
first move, often expecting to be caught and, as in chess, sacrificing a
piece to prod their rival's defences, who then responds before it's the
attacker's turn again, and so on until the game is over.

"Attackers are usually a step ahead, so often it's a catch-up game,"
explains Mehis Hakkaja, the Red Team leader and CEO of a cybersecurity
company in Tallinn.

Attacking is easier than defending because -- be it a smart toy, a
mobile phone or an airport's power grid -- the hackers may just need
access to one entry point while the defenders have to protect all the
possibilities.

"The internet is very vulnerable to manipulation if the actors are
professional, and especially if they are nation states \[which can use
their bureaucracy to set well-organised cyberoffensives\]," says Kenneth
Geers, senior fellow at the Atlantic Council's Cyber Statecraft
Initiative and a CCDCOE ambassador.

In 2014, the Russian offensive in
eastern [Ukraine](http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/ukraine.html) and
the annexation of Crimea included -- like this year's Locked Shields --
cyberattacks against power grids and an airport.

The Russian campaign
in [Georgia](http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/georgia.html) in
2008 had already been preceded by cyberattacks against Georgian
websites. And the year before the target had been Estonia, which after a
diplomatic row
with [Russia](http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/russia.html) received
three waves of cyberattacks that blocked government, banks, media and
telecom companies' websites.

Fingers have been pointed at Russia for the attacks, but there isn't
definite evidence of the Kremlin being behind them. And it's of course
not just Moscow: the most famous cyber-attack of all, the
malware [Stuxnet](http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2011/06/20116673330569900.html),
which managed to damage the Iranian nuclear industry, is believed to
have originated in the US
and [Israel](http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/israel.html).

By the second day of attacks in Locked Shields, some Blue Teams have had
their airbase's power grid hacked, leaving the airport without
electricity, which means no planes could land or take off from the
island nation, effectively cutting if off from the rest of the world. As
the prime minister of Berylia, what would you do in this situation?

**[[The overall aim of the]{.mark} political [game is to push the Blue
Teams to]{.mark} a point where they are forced to [consider invoking
Article 5 and taking NATO to war]{.mark} against
Crimsonia.]{.underline}**

"**[And surprisingly most nations did. Basically, [they all went to
war]{.mark}]{.underline}**, we didn't expect it," says Matthijs
Veenendaal, head of this part of the game and Strategy Branch Chief at
the CCDCOE.

Veenendaal says last year in a similar situation, no team invoked
Article 5.

But he believes that the teams that went to war did so on purpose to
push the scenario to its limits and make the most of the learning
experience.

In today's tense geopolitical situation, and seeing how in the past
supposed cyberaggressors got away with attacking, why don't rival
countries launch more damaging cyberoffensives against each other?

A Cyber Cold War

First, many cyberattacks never become public and so there might actually
be serious cyberaggressions between nations that we don't know of. Then,
"there's some evidence the major powers are inside each other's systems
quite a lot," says Fred Kaplan, author of Dark Territory: The Secret
History of Cyber-War.

This would allow some countries to know who is attacking whom, but at
the same time would prevent them from using this information publicly to
avoid revealing their methods of cyberespionage.

On the other hand, **[[the big powers being inside each other's
networks]{.mark} can [make possible an immediate counteroffensive.
It's]{.mark} a situation [not dissimilar to]{.mark} the use of [nuclear
weapons]{.mark}, like a sort of Cyber Cold War, in which cyberespionage
is tacitly admitted but the major powers avoid harming each other too
much by cyber means out of fear of having their own systems destroyed
too.]{.underline}**

But cyberattacking is not just about computers; it is also about
reaching minds and influencing your rival's society.

["\[While\] the US and UK understanding of 'cyber' is predominantly
technical and computer network-based ..., Russia and China use a
cognitive approach based on understanding of mass psychology and of how
to exploit individuals,"]{.underline} said
a[ report](https://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201617/cmselect/cmpubadm/496/496.pdf) published
last April by a British parliamentary committee and referring to the
2016 American elections
and [Brexit](http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/events/brexit.html) referendum.

"[The implications of this different understanding of cyber-attack, as
purely technical or as reaching beyond the digital to influence public
opinion, for the interference in elections and referendums are
clear."]{.underline}

Then, of course, the US, the UK and other Western powers have a record
of trying to interfere in other countries' elections by different means.

Information warfare and cyberespionage are here to stay, but experts
agree that **[the omnipresence of computer systems in every aspect of
our lives means all armed conflicts will have a cyber dimension. And
here the danger may lie in the big differences between decision-makers
and hackers.]{.underline}**

"The gap between strategy and tactics is huge, and the two groups don't
really know each other that well or even speak the same language," says
Kenneth Geers.

"Cyberspace is much more Sun Tzu than it is Stalingrad: you have to
apply a lot of intelligence, and a lot of forethought and imagination
into a cyberattack, it's a very complicated thing.

"And so often the effects \[decision makers\] are seeking to achieve are
inconsistent or incongruous with the \[cyber\] means available, which
are really quite narrow and very specific," he adds.

The human element

[Technologically, things are only going to get more
complicated]{.underline} as more devices get connected and can,
therefore, be hacked. 

Cybercriminals can make money and also create chaos, as shown by the
ransomware attacks that affected many countries in recent weeks. But it
is **[state actors [going on the cyberoffensive]{.mark}]{.underline}**
that **[[can really be destructive.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

["In terms of what would an all-out cyberwar look like, I sometimes
dread to think,"]{.underline} says Ian West, NATO cybersecurity chief,
speaking from this agency's office in Mons, Belgium.

"Because of our dependence on computer systems for so much in our lives,
so much in our countries and our organisations**[, the
destruction]{.underline}** or perhaps just the changes **[that [could
be]{.mark} made to these systems could be [absolutely
catastrophic]{.mark} and have a subsequent catastrophic effect on
nations."]{.underline}**

#### **Advantage 2: Cyberwar Games**

#### **Traditional understandings of war as an antagonistic exchange between adversarial nations conceals the way war functions as an [operational process.]{.underline} The perfection of this process produces a seamless economy of violence that liquidates all subjectivity and meaning.**

Lecturer of War Studies, Department of Military Science, Swedish Defense
College, Stockholm, "Targeting the Ontology of War: From Clausewitz to
Baudrillard" in Millennium: Journal of International Studies 43 (2):
399-403) \*we don't endorse ableist language

**[In [Baudrillard']{.mark}s notorious critique of the Gulf war he
[identifies traditional conceptions of war]{.mark} as [involvi]{.mark}ng
the ontology we have seen in critical war studies and contemporary
military doctrine: 'war is born of [an antagonistic]{.mark}, destructive
but dual [relation between]{.mark} two
[adversaries']{.mark}]{.underline}**.40 However, he argues, **[[if this
is war, then there is no war taking place]{.mark} in the
Gulf.]{.underline}** One important but hereto neglected reason for this
argument is Baudrillard's claim that **[[war has disappeared
into]{.mark} the [processing]{.mark} of warfare.]{.underline}**
Baudrillard never fully developed this discussion, but he wrote
extensively on the subject from a general perspective in his final
works. Therein Baudrillard points to the way **[[subjectivity disappears
in operational processing]{.mark} as part of the attempt [to fulfil and
perfect potential]{.mark}]{.underline}**.41 Baudrillard sees
**[subjectivity [becoming]{.mark} a subordinated [part of technological
media]{.mark}, 'a perfectly operational molecule that is left to its own
devices and doomed to \... reproduce, self-identically, to
infinity'.]{.underline}**42 In his view, **[we are faced with a
situation in which [subjectivity, social relations and will are]{.mark}
essentially [liquidated by operational practices]{.mark}. They are not
supplanted by a higher will or a higher purpose. Rather, [they vanish
into processing entirely devoid of symbolic
meaning.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

[This indicates that it is not physical disappearance Baudrillard
discusses, but disappearance which strictly relates to the
symbolic.]{.underline} Baudrillard on numerous occasions illustrated
this idea through Alfred Jarry's novel *The Supermale*, which tells a
story of how automated processing dissolves limits between man and
technology. The apex of the story is a 10,000-mile bicycle race -- the
perpetual motion race -- which takes place between a five-man bicycle
and an express train. In the race the cyclists function as a
collaborative machine to challenge the train over long distance. The
cyclists reach a speed that enables them to ride side by side with the
locomotive -- to become limitless automatons in the rhythm of the
machine. This becoming comes at a price, since the cyclists gradually
disappear as humans, as they reach the speed of the train. One of them
disappears quite literally as he dies on his post. However, his
decomposing corpse, strapped to the bicycle, pedals on. The corpse
stands as a symbolic marker for how the rest of the bodies also
disappear by being absorbed into the process itself. In the end, the
five-man machine rides alongside the train with the living and dead
corpses riding at maximum speed in order to keep up. This theme, of
transformation of man into machine, is also evident in the rest of the
novel, which ends with its key figure dying while transforming into a
machine.43

As Rex Butler points out, the novel helps to draw up the:

**[\[V\]ision of a society in \... which [humans are
unnecessary]{.mark}. We see this vision coming true [in]{.mark} those
self-enclosed and [self-perpetuating systems of
simulation]{.mark}]{.underline}** that Baudrillard analyses, **[[which
have no outside]{.mark}]{.underline}** and no need to be explained by an
other, and whose best model would be the bicycle proposed by Alfred
Jarry, which still continues to pedal long after its riders have passed
away with fatigue.44

[[The image]{.underline}]{.mark} Jarry paints in the novel [[illustrates
**the symbolic disappearance of subjectivity by emphasising the
repetitive and inherently meaningless relationship we have with various
media**]{.mark} **that surround us. [The attempt to reach a perfect
speed and efficiency by way of the mechanic process works back on
subjectivity]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

**[It is not far-fetched to see the [recent conceptual inventions in
military thought, such as the Effects Based Approach to
Operations]{.mark}]{.underline}** (EBAO), **[[Comprehensive
Approach]{.underline}]{.mark}** (CA), **[[or Network Centric
Warfare]{.underline}]{.mark}** (NCW), as part of the characteristic that
Baudrillard is concerned with and Jarry's novel illustrates. The common
denominator of **[these concepts]{.underline}** is the way they
**[[attempt to synchronise, coordinate, and make warfare more
efficient]{.mark} through staff procedures. They are all based on the
idea that [perfect operationalisation generates a war in which all means
and capabilities are interconnected in]{.mark} ways that aim to create
[a seamless economy of violence]{.mark}. This in turn indicates that
[the subject of warfare dissolves into operationalised
repetition]{.mark}. Such an argument does not entail that militaries,
insurgents, weapon-systems, logistical capacities and so forth are
disappearing on a material level. Rather, as part of a symbolic
disappearance through the fulfilments of technological processes,
[warfare strives towards perfection]{.mark} and symbolic aspects
disappear through a model which is being operationalised as if it is
war. This should not be taken to mean that there is an end to violence
or suffering. [There is]{.mark} of course [bodily violence and
death]{.mark} in military operations [despite the attempt to fulfil
wars' every potential through repeated calls for 'high-precision
munition' and 'zero-death warfare'. However, processing and repetition
also participate in making the representation of bodies and subjects
disappear in operationalisation.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

The concern here is that **[[focusing on]{.mark} the violence displayed
in [war-as-fighting might obscure a systemic violence]{.mark} which
stems from the way [in which war is
operationalised]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Baudrillard argues that **[[the
type of violence the military normally battles]{.mark} (such as
terrorism) [is far less lethal than the violence which replaces the
subject with]{.mark} the will of [an operational and technocratic
structure]{.mark}]{.underline}**.45 What we have, then, is **[a certain
kind of disappearance]{.underline}** which **[is obscured
by]{.underline}** (among other things) **[the focus on war as violent
exchange between subjects.]{.underline}**

How do **[we go from the ontology of war as generative to an ontology of
war as disappearance]{.underline}**? To understand the transition it is
helpful to return to the idea that **[war is considered generative as it
exceeds social orders.]{.underline}** Albeit helpful in order to
understand war's excess in terms of productivity it is also possible to
understand excess differently, as a force of disappearance. Baudrillard
argues that **[social reality disappears not because of a lack, but
rather because of excess, arguing precisely that wars fought by the US
tend to be 'wars of excess']{.underline}**.46 **[One under-analysed
aspect of the ontology of war is therefore the way in which the excess
it gives rise to is not simply generative of appearances, but in turn
forces disappearances.]{.underline}** If we complement the generative
notion of war's excess with Baudrillard's argument that **[excess is in
and of itself a cause of disappearance]{.underline}**, we can appreciate
that **[the ontology of war might at times be generative, and at times
erase the preconditions for appearance.]{.underline}** On one hand it is
correct that bodies, experience or materiality frame our understanding
of war by generating narratives. On the other it is important to
acknowledge that **[[subjectivity disappears through the excess of the
processes themselves]{.mark}. Through such an acknowledgement we can see
that warfare conditions the possibility of appearance as it 'always,
already' works as a process of disappearance.]{.underline}** Arguably
targeting is a prime example of the latter.

Although Baudrillard highlights technology as integral to the effect of
war's disappearance into process, he does not dwell on the exact
mechanisms it entails. This is a task that we therefore undertake here.
The next part examines **[the military targeting process]{.underline}**
as one example of the attempt to create the perfect war. This process
**[creates 'an iterative logical methodology for development, planning,
execution, and assessment of effective- ness']{.underline}**.47 In what
follows, we examine how **[[this methodology works to rid war of its
underlying principles: subjectivity, antagonism and
exchange]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

Target Processing and the Disappearance of War

How are we to interpret targeting doctrines? As Josef Teboho Ansorge
argues, [military doctrine has a particular form of arrangement, which
helps to 'both describe and make the world]{.underline}'.48 [Doctrinal
text relies heavily on abbreviations and contains an impersonal and
administrative language]{.underline}. It is as if the potential for
symbolism -- for the text to mean more than itself -- has been
subtracted from the paragraphs in favour of Orwellian 'new- speak'. We
might say that **[[military doctrines]{.mark} not only make a world
appear, but also [dissolve meaning]{.mark} and are therefore acts of
disappearance]{.underline}**. **[We can also read the charts,
appendices, images, power-point slides, meeting protocols and
organisational routines as part of this disappearance.]{.underline}**
One amusing example is the well-known and extremely intricate
'Afghanistan Stability/COIN dynamics' slide (also called 'the sprawling
spaghetti diagram') which went viral in 2010.49 This slide was supposed
to convey meaning about how to 'win' the war in Afghanistan. The flow
chart listed pretty much every targetable process relating to irregular
warfare as part of this attempt. While it utterly failed to make the
conflict meaningful (despite its excess of meaning) it succeeded, by
virtue of becoming an overexposed internet joke, **[to obscure the fact
that war-as-fighting, or war as such, had long since
disappeared]{.underline}** from Afghanistan.

**[A common conception of targeting processes is that they are related
to the operational level of warfare]{.underline}** (linking tactical
with strategic and political aims). **[As such they are an integral part
of how warfare aims to translate strategic aims into tactical
effects]{.underline}** (and *vice versa*). **[[Military doctrine
represents targeting as the process of selecting and prioritising
targets and matching actions]{.mark} in order to achieve strategic
objectives.]{.underline}**50 **[The purpose of targeting is therefore to
'provide the commander with a methodology' and 'a logical
progression']{.underline}**.51 **[This is done by virtue of constructing
targets, conceptualising them as a system, linking them to outcomes as
part of synchronising other parts of military operations, and [by
creating organisational routines]{.mark} -- all with the aim of
supporting the 'battle- rhythm'.]{.underline}**52 Technically speaking,
[a battle-rhythm can be understood as 'the combination \... of
procedures, processes \... and \... actions' which 'facilitates
extended-continuous operations'.]{.underline}53 **[Taken to its limit,
this implies [heeding the tempo of the operational process regardless
of]{.mark} human [subjectivity]{.mark}]{.underline}** (just like the
bike-train in Jarry's novel). In the doctrines, **[effective targeting
is measured by how well it facilitates operational planning and chosen
objectives in an area of operations]{.underline}**.54 Importantly, it is
also measured by how well it enables a particular tempo during
operations. Consequently, **[[targeting]{.mark} ideally [strives towards
maximum efficiency]{.mark} according to the model constructed in
operational planning, [while agency disappears]{.mark} in the search for
a perfect process.]{.underline}**

If we look closely at **[the underlying principles of
targeting]{.underline}** we notice that they **[do not emphasise
adversaries, exchange or antagonism, but focus on how to perfect the
model of warfare.]{.underline}** We read in *JP 3-60* that key
principles are: coordination and synchronisation, rapid response, a
minimal duplication of effort, expeditious assessments of executed
operations, a common perspective on targeting efforts, and a full
integration of capabilities of the process. This means that **[targeting
provides a cycle to describe how warfare should be
conducted.]{.underline}**55 This cycle is on the one hand indicative of
a methodology of contemporary warfare, and **[[the actualisation of a
model that makes war a type of processing ad
infinitum.]{.underline}]{.mark}** [War gets its own (battle) rhythm,
which territorialises a space (the area of operations) and the pace of
the operation (into current time and future time).]{.underline} **[This
creates a reality-principle which helps us appreciate that the war
conducted is a modelled, repeatable war. It is dispersed into an
enormous amount of operational meetings, power- points, steering groups
and so forth.]{.underline}**

On the other hand, **[we can read [targeting]{.mark} as a subtraction of
meaning which [pulverises subjectivity through attempted
perfection.]{.mark}]{.underline}** On a symbolic level **[there is no
'warrior' in this warfare]{.underline}**. Granted, the doctrines often
invoke subjects such as 'the warfighter' or 'the targeteer' as those who
are supposed to decide upon, detect, deliver effects of, and assess the
targeting process.56 However, **[[the 'agent']{.mark} here [is the
medium itself which helps to reduce each aspect of subjectivity into
fractal,]{.mark} self-identical [molecules which]{.mark} merely
[mirror]{.mark} functions of [the process]{.mark}.]{.underline}** This
is not to say that individuals are absent from targeting. [The
nomination and approval of potential targets is a process that involves
not only the military but also politicians, lawyers, political advisors,
gender advisors and environ- mental advisors, to mention but a few. It
also involves a number of boards]{.underline} (such as the Joint Target
Coordination Board, Joint Target Working Groups), lists (Target
Nomination List, Joint Integrated Prioritized Target List), and support
cells (Target Support Cell, Information Operation Cell), [all involving
complex meeting schedules. Not to mention what the doctrine aptly calls
'the myriad processes, sub-processes, and cycles associated with joint
targeting']{.underline}.57 Through these, **[[target-processing
proclaims to be]{.mark} concerned with means and ends, thus linking
tactics to politics and [creating a seamless economy of
violence.]{.mark} What it really accomplishes is [to make subjectivity
disappear in the excess of the process itself.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Judith Butler argues in *Frames of War* that:

Surely, common sense tells us that persons wage war, not the instruments
they deploy**[. [But what happens if the instruments acquire their own
agency, such that persons become extensions of those
instruments?\...]{.mark}]{.underline}** persons use technological
instruments, but instruments surely also use persons (position them,
endow them with perspective, and establish the trajectory of their
action).58

We similarly ask **[[what happens when the process of warfare as such
acquires its own momentum, uses persons, and forms and erases
subjectivity]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In short, **[what happens when the
process becomes not only the means but also the end-point]{.underline}**
of war? Importantly, **[if the subject is disappearing in repetitive
excess, what happens to the enemy Other]{.underline}**?

#### Operationalized war processing accelerates: everything becomes a target destined for annihilation.

College, Stockholm, "Targeting the Ontology of War: From Clausewitz to
Baudrillard" in Millennium: Journal of International Studies 43 (2):
403-406) \*we don't endorse ableist language

As *JP 3-60* states no target is critical in and of itself. A target is
measured only by how it is part of target-sets, target-systems or
matrices.59 However, on a symbolic level, a target is nothing but a
'target folder'. This folder contains mainly a classification code, a
name, coordinates, photograph and information on which weapons are
suitable for usage. Since a target in the doctrines is 'an area,
complex, installation, force, equipment, capability, function or
behaviour identified for possible action'60 **[[the process subsumes all
possible things as targets:]{.mark} subjects, objects, ideas, emotions,
networks]{.underline}**.61 Therefore, **[although targeting involves
violence it does so not as exchange, or as symbolic appearance, but
rather as an inclusion of 'targetable' objects. Targets depend on the
targeting procedure itself, as it processes objects through meetings,
nominations, and documents into the end-point of a spreadsheet. In this
sense [the target is a result of a medium that erases the]{.mark} very
[conditions of its appearance and forces it symbolically and literally
to disappear]{.mark} as object.]{.underline}**

As targets are nominated by a number of organisational sub-components
(such as tactical army, navy or air force staff) one integral aspect is
to keep up with the pace of operations. Low-ranking commanders typically
need to nominate targets in order to keep up with the battle-rhythm.
**[[Processing demands an excess of targets]{.underline}]{.mark}**
(which is also an excess of disappearances), **[enough [so that the
medium is saturated]{.mark}, which occurs at meetings when the
spreadsheets are full and nothing more can be acted upon. In fact, the
doctrines explicitly state that there will always be more targets in an
area of operations than it is possible to destroy]{.underline}**.62 As
Peter Row puts it (with regards to the NATO bombings in Kosovo):
'\[t\]he reality of the situation is that those objects which military
commanders wished to attack, for whatever reason, were attacked'.63
**[The milieu of warfare is in this sense very much a derivative of its
process as a military methodology. However, the methodology includes all
manner of things as targets, and their disappearance has less to do with
wishing destruction]{.underline}** (as Row claims) **[and more to do
with the way [antagonistic exchange is supplanted for the repetition of
war as a process.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

How are we to understand the temporal aspects of such targeting
processes? We have argued that **[[subjects disappear in the
'battle-rhythm']{.mark}.]{.underline}** If we look closely at the
temporal aspects of targeting we find that it involves planned aspects
and dynamic-real time aspects.64 What are we to make of this? [Planned
targeting is strictly speaking taking place from the future. The
organisational routine projects a number of days into the
future.]{.underline} Operational warfare does not take place merely in
real-time but also in future time. In the processing of targets the
meetings occur on 'D+3' or 'D+6'. It is one aspect of what we might call
operational time, where the present moment is appropriated by the
vantage point of a modelled future. In this modelling the possibility of
a human encounter in the here-now disappears, since 'now' has been
pre-planned days earlier. Dynamic (or time-sensitive) targeting on the
other hand is war in real-time from an instantaneous present. [**[This
process helps]{.mark} to follow and [take out targets in real-time as a
complement to pre-planned targeting]{.mark}**.]{.underline} This is a
costly and difficult part of targeting. The doctrines lament that so few
targets can be followed in real-time: 'not all targets can be tracked
constantly due to limited resources'.65 This arguably complements an
operational time that contains both an appropriated future and an
instantaneous present. Finally, [both aspects of targeting --
pre-planned and dynamic -- end up in delivery through a type of (weapon)
system. **[This delivery needs to be extremely high paced -- preferably
immediate]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Former United States Under-Secretary
of Defence William Perry sums up this principle: '**[[as soon as you can
see the target, you can expect to destroy it']{.underline}]{.mark}**.66
And indeed, **[a missile is absent until it hits the target. It appears
only to disappear and to make the world around it disappear in
turn.]{.underline}**

Thus, the temporal aspect of targeting can be understood as a
disappearance of encounters. **[Operational warfare does not work as an
antagonistic exchange between two opposing subjects,]{.underline}** at
least not from the perspective of the system generating these targeting
strategies. **[[Exchange and encounters disappear into]{.mark} the
[real-time]{.mark} of [dynamic targeting and]{.mark} in the future
[instant]{.mark} of [pre-planned targeting.]{.mark} The same happens to
the experiences, bodies or narratives introduced as a basis for a
different ontology of war. Targeting as a method and as part of war at a
distance makes encounters impossible.]{.underline}** In this type of
predetermined battle-rhythm, where the military duty is to attend and
facilitate this process, target nomination becomes repetitive and
mandatory. This means that **[[the battle-rhythm works as a 'processor'
that grinds out target]{.mark}s and applies not so much means to ends,
but rather the process itself as an end. [It is a kind of war 'so
predicted, programmed, anticipated, prescribed and modelled that it has
exhausted all its possibilities before even taking
place']{.mark}]{.underline}**.67 Just like Jarry's five-man machine had
to keep pace with the rhythm of the machine, so does the tandem of
soldiers need to keep pace with the battle-rhythm in operational
planning. [The repetitive procedures force a certain reality around war
to disappear.]{.underline} This aspect of disappearance is evident in
the way targeting involves a particular repetition, which develops
target packages, nominates targets, and tasks and weaponeers against
those targets.

What happens when we take this logic to its end-point? As we have seen,
**[targeting implies that everything in an 'area of operations' is a
possible target, and any area is a possible area of
operations]{.underline}**. Moreover, not all targets are possible to
track due to limited resources -- but ideally all targets are possible
to track at all times. **[[There is no agent left]{.mark} in this
procedure, as [it is replaced by the momentum of the targeting process
itself.]{.mark} Subsequently, [a target is not the Other of the
pulverised subject or of the targeting process -- but a folder
corresponding to something]{.mark} which is [destroyed as it
appears.]{.mark} There will always be more targets than it is possible
to destroy. The process aims to pre-plan them all into folders. Ideally
they can all be destroyed]{.underline}**. In short, **[symbolically,
every subject, object or exchange is potentially gone from the (global)
area of operations -- lost in the rhythm and scope that appropriates
them. When this is achievable in a seamless process -- efficient,

The War that Remains

We have argued to this point that **[critical war
studies]{.underline}**, in Clausewitz's footsteps, is emerging as a
field of study that **[is strongly attached to a particular ontology of
'war']{.underline}**.

We have also argued, however, that **[[contemporary warfare]{.mark}
(particularly [in NATO countries) can]{.mark} alternatively [be
understood]{.mark}, not through the type of 'war' their ontology implies
(war-as-fighting), but rather [through]{.mark} various [operational
procedures.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Our point has been to suggest that
[[there is little or no symbolism left in a warfare]{.underline}]{.mark}
which processes targets as spreadsheets, target packages and
tasking-orders, through a predetermined rhythm of meetings [[which leads
it, not to a battlefield, but to an administrative
model]{.underline}]{.mark}. This model finds its ontology in Baudrillard
rather than in Clausewitz. **[Through military operations [we move from
war as antagonistic exchange]{.mark} between subjects, [to war as
technical realisation.]{.mark} The race between targeting process and
battle-rhythm resolves subjectivity, the Other and symbolic exchange
through the repetition of operational procedures. [This is not an
example of war-as-fighting, but the]{.mark} [enactment of a pre-planned
script.]{.mark} This characteristic is by no means exclusive to the
targeting process; rather it [is indicative of how military planning is
conducted in]{.mark} most [NATO]{.mark} countries. [It is]{.mark}
therefore [crucial to think of disappearance]{.mark} -- enabled and
exacerbated by the way warfare is infinitely repeated -- [as an integral
part of]{.mark} thinking about [an ontology of
war]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

However, if target-processing and associated ways of operationalising
warfare is making war in the Clausewitzean sense disappear, then [**[why
is warfare made to appear as fighting]{.underline}**? [We are constantly
immersed in 'war' through television, art, computer games,]{.underline}
]{.mark}[military recruiting campaigns, and arms industry projects.
[They call forth 'war' as antagonistic and generative
exchange.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[Consider]{.underline}]{.mark} the
(simulated) fighting between warriors in the stream of screenings that
includes [[Spartacus, 300, Troy, Braveheart, Apocalypto, or The Last
Samurai]{.underline}]{.mark}. Computer games centred on war and politics
-- *Civilization, Hearts of Iron, Total War* -- unfold through the idea
that war is a struggle between antagonistic forms of political life.
Andreas Behnke argues (correctly in our view) that **[[the Western
notion of war has lost its ontological grounding.]{.mark}]{.underline}**
He reads this as part of a paradox since despite its loss, **[[warfare
needs to be aestheticised and legitimised]{.underline}]{.mark}** 'beyond
the purely instrumental'.68 The explanation for why this is the case
often lies precisely in the way [representation helps [to reinforce and
militarise society, as it justifies a liberal world
order.]{.mark}]{.underline}[6]{.mark}9 [Arguably, this explanation
eschews the prior question of why the study of war needs to imagine an
antagonistic and generative war in the first place]{.underline}. What
does the idea that war is antagonistic and generative obscure? Or put
more crudely, **[[who gains from reifying war as]{.mark} 'war', or
war-as-[fighting?]{.mark}]{.underline}**

As an attempt to answer this we complement the prior explanation by
suggesting that **[[recent theories of 'war']{.mark} have underplayed
the way in which operational warfare is also, in and of itself, an act
of disappearance.]{.underline}** In doing so, **[they [over emphasise
genesis at the expense of disappearance, and obscure the loss of
exchange and subjectivity from the 'war']{.mark} they claim to depict,
at the same time as [they feed from its reification]{.mark} as such.
[This 'war' allows NATO's member countries to]{.mark} send out war
correspondents in body armour and helmets; to give first person
shooters]{.underline}** like *Battlefield* enough **[status as reality;
to give movies like Hurt-locker]{.underline}**, television dramas like
*Generation Kill*, and documentaries like *Armadillo* **[their necessary
ontological back-drop]{.underline}**. Moreover, **[it is there to allow
for [spend]{.mark}ing [vertiginous amounts of money on recruitment, arms
production, government transitions, advertising, aid, education
and]{.mark} -- last but not least -- [military operations and
target-processing.]{.mark} Crucially, ['war' is there to allow the
researcher to study war in peace]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[All of us
who feed from this are part of [an extreme reification]{.mark} of war --
which [hides]{.mark} not only [that 'war']{.mark} may have [ceased to be
a meaningful term which structures reality]{.mark}, but also that these
renditions of war is the closest we have to 'war']{.underline}** as it
is described by Clausewitz. **[The ontology of war debates in which we
engage are therefore part of this reification of war.]{.underline}**

In this way, [**[the distinction between an act of warfare and the
attempt to understand wars' underlying principles is lost through the
notion of war-as-fighting.]{.underline}** **[Every attempt
to]{.underline}** ]{.mark}**[wage war or [think war]{.mark} in its own
right]{.underline}** (or to oppose or neglect war for that matter)
**[[refers back to this loss of meaning and
distinction]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Understood in this way**[, the focus
of [research on the ontology of war]{.mark} or on better understanding
'war' as an object (to make it appear as meaningful), also [bestows a
reality to the attempts to deal with war.]{.mark} The question of
whether the notion of war as antagonistic and generative exchange is
real is therefore not the issue, as any ontology of war risks this type
of reification. Rather, [we should ask why it might seem so costly to
leave this particular ontology behind]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Could it
be because the various ways of grappling with war's ontology are active
parts of how this reality remains intact?

Should we (and could we) forget the reality of 'war'? Moreover**[, [is a
world without referents like 'war' a world with less violence?
No]{.mark},]{.underline}** says Baudrillard, it is not: **[['\[t\]he
immanence of the death of all the great referents \... is expressed by
exacerbating the forms of violence]{.mark} and representation that
characterized them']{.underline}**.70 This helps us understand why,
paradoxically**, [[in an era in which war-as-fighting has disappeared,
we all speak about it, analyse it, play it on our computers and
experience it through books and films]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- and why
a calling for war studies is a logical step in the disappearance of war-
as-fighting. This argument could be directed against other disciplines
too -- '[war' is not a privileged object in any respect.]{.underline}
Nonetheless, to call for a renewed discipline of 'war studies' --
encouraging as it may be, especially to all of us who receive research
funding based on the existence of such a discipline -- is therefore not
without problems**[. It is not so much a call for an understanding of
war as it is a call to supplant the absence of war in International
Relations with a particular categorical ~~blindness,~~ since [strictly
speaking war is never there]{.mark}. Rather, [it provides a 'simulation
of perspective']{.mark}]{.underline}** as Baudrillard would call it.71
**[The problem is that [the organised violence to which we constantly
refer has no other reality than that of the
model]{.mark}.]{.underline}**72 That is, **[it has no other reality than
the reality [provided by representations of war]{.mark}]{.underline}**
(which is not to say that they are one and the same). **[Through this
simulation, war returns as an imperative to thought. It is an
explanation or an understanding through a particular category ('war')
and not of a state of things (actions, reactions, challenges,
automatism, repetition, processing). 'War' works as an
imperative:]{.underline}**

**['You've got a military and you must learn how to use it well'\
'You've got a weapon-system and you must learn how to operate it'\
'You've got a target and you must learn how to task it'\
'You've got an ontology of war and you must learn how to think through
it.]{.underline}**'

Conclusion

War is understood in recent debates on critical **[war]{.underline}**
studies as **[characterised by antagonistic and generative
exchange.]{.underline}** This amounts to a view in which '**[[war' helps
provide a context in which acts of violence become meaningful]{.mark}.
They receive a pattern, reciprocity and a 'natural' demarcation that can
be named and criticised.]{.underline}** This article has argued that
contemporary understandings of war and warfare are well advised to find
new ontolog*ies* complementing the notion that war is fighting. We have
presented one such attempt, resonating with Baudrillard's notion of
war-processing, based on an analysis of the planning and conduct of
military operations (in NATO countries). This attempt outlines **[how
warfare strives towards its own 'perfect' and self-referential
model.]{.underline}** We illustrate this through an analysis of military
targeting so as to point to how **[[warfare becomes a reiterative and
automated process which constructs a seamless economy of
violence]{.mark}.]{.underline}** We read targeting **[as a perpetual
motion to keep up with the battle-rhythm of military
operations]{.underline}** and argue that it rids what is termed 'war' of
its underlying principles: adversaries, antagonism and exchange.

**[[An understanding of war which neglects this]{.mark} aspect [risks
missing that war (as processing]{.mark}) strictly speaking
[lacks]{.mark} an [antagonistic engagement]{.mark} with 'an enemy' and
in so doing calls into question many of the underlying principles that
the notion of war- as-fighting rests upon. Doing so leaves the theorist
of war and IR with a ~~blind~~ spot: the conception of 'war' that has
become operational while being obscured by the reification of 'war' as
fighting.]{.underline}** Barkawi and Brighton associate the absence of a
discipline of war studies with an 'othering of violence from inquiry'.74
We again state explicitly, therefore, that we are not advocating the
continuation of such othering. To say **[that war as processing lacks
antagonism is not to say that it lacks violence. [Warfare is a highly
violent practice but it]{.mark} [seems to occur amidst a breakdown of
symbolic relations between a subject and an Other]{.mark}. This would
point to acts of insurgency or terror being ways of acting out, rather
than a response as such.75 [The 'perfect war']{.mark} we have described
[is highly violent]{.mark} indeed -- [but that does not make it
'fighting'.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

This is not to say that war should be reduced to an automated process
between man and machine. Rather we want to point out that
**[[war-as-fighting neglects the way]{.mark} in which [subjectivity,
symbolism and exchange are]{.mark} often [lacking in military targeting
--]{.mark} something which needs to be considered if we are to better
understand the relationship between the ontic realty of warfare and the
ontology of war.]{.underline}** In light of our argument, **[the
ontology of war can be read not only as a way of thinking 'war' but also
as an imperative to thought.]{.underline}** We are aware that this
imperative does not work through simple causality. The targeting
doctrines we have looked at are not representative of all warfare. A
task for future research would be to contrast it to, for example, the
way 'insurgents' or 'civilians' subjected to military violence represent
warfare. Another would be to examine disappearance in the wider contexts
of counter-insurgency and network-centric warfare.

Nevertheless, [[there is a risk that (critical) war studies in invoking
the ontology of war- as-fighting is led back to an antagonistic and
generative exchange between subjects]{.underline}]{.mark} -- whether
this is actually taking place or not. [[Attempts to think of politics,
ethics, security or gender risk being forced through the mould of this
particular ontology of war]{.mark}.]{.underline} Following Baudrillard,
[an attempt to rethink and complement the ontology of war should
challenge it in a way that forces its 'truth to withdraw -- just as if
one were pulling the chair out from under someone about to sit
down']{.underline}.76 [**[We]{.mark} therefore [need to think war in a
way that pulls the chair out from underneath the gamer, policy maker,
military officer or theorist ]{.mark}**[a**bout to sit down to 'do
war'.**]{.mark}]{.underline} What does **[this act of ['pulling the
chair' from underneath thought]{.mark}]{.underline}** leave us with? Our
hope is that it **[[opens]{.mark} up]{.underline}** **[for [the
possibility of rethinking ontologies of war in a fashion that
helps]{.mark} us better understand and [challenge their relationship to
various ontic realities.]{.mark}]{.underline}** [Taking this question
seriously gives us a new vantage point on (critical) war studies for
future debates.]{.underline}

### I/L \-- Escalation

#### **Three internal links to escalation: (1) Crimsonia's meddling with Berylian drone facilities drives [fear]{.underline} of [covert]{.underline} cyberattacks. (2) Crimsonia targets Revalia but makes Berylia look responsible. (3) Cyber-attacks on Berylian critical information infrastructure disrupts Berylian communication channels.** 

**Hauptman 16** (Allyson, MA in Computer Science and Cyber Security,
"Designing Digital Forensics Challenges for Multinational Cyber Defense
Exercises" UNIVERSITY OF TARTU Institute of Computer Science Cyber
Security Curriculum MA Thesis, pp. 18-22)

Overall Scenario As previously mentioned, digital forensics injects need
to exist within the overall exercise scenario for a government cyber
exercise. The Locked Shields 2016 scenario involves three States:
Crimsonia, Berylia, and Revalia, three rival states within a local
region. Essentially the Red Team is the villain nation of Crimsonia, and
the Blue Teams play the role of Berylia. Revalia, while not initially at
war with either, is a rival state within the region \[34\].
**[[Berylia\'s primary industry is drones]{.mark}, an industry that
Crimsonia is interested in advancing. [Crimsonia will]{.mark} begin
[attack]{.mark}ing the [civilian-operated drone facilities of
Berylia]{.mark}, and the Berylian government deploys rapid reaction
teams]{.underline}** (the Blue Teams) to the facilities \[34\]. The
scenario asks the digital forensics designers to create a situation in
which **[[Crimsonia conducts a cyber attack on Revalia but tries to make
it look like Berylia conducted the attack]{.mark} in an effort to get
Revalia to join the conflict on Crimsonia\'s side]{.underline}** \[34\].
Berylia needs to prove to Revalia that Crimsonia is the responsible
party. Additionally, the exercise creators ask the designers to show
that **[[Crimsonia has been stealing documents related to drone use and
development]{.mark} from the facilities]{.underline}** \[34\]. Locked
Shields, like most [[large scale state-based cyber
exercises]{.underline}]{.mark}, is intended to [[mimic **the worst case
scenario** ]{.mark}**where multiple attacks and exploits are
executed**]{.underline}. This is why it is important that the digital
forensics challenge contain multiple layers \[34\]. Berylia\'s technical
environment consists of various operating system types, including Linux,
Ubuntu, Windows 8, and Windows 10. The exercise coordinators specified
that the compromised machine for the forensics challenge needs to be
Windows 10. The coordinators granted permission for the acquisition
phase to take place on the exercise\'s preparation day, Day 0. The rest
of the challenge will take place over Day 1 and Day 2 (the entire
exercise is one preparation and two game-play days) \[34\].

Berylia\'s technical environment consists of various operating system
types, including Linux, Ubuntu, Windows 8, and Windows 10. The exercise
coordinators specified that the compromised machine for the forensics
challenge needs to be Windows 10. The coordinators granted permission
for the acquisition phase to take place on the exercise\'s preparation
day, Day 0. The rest of the challenge will take place over Day 1 and Day
2 (the entire exercise is one preparation and two game-play days)
\[34\]. At this point in the challenge development, the thesis author
and the other designers need to answer the scenario questions from the
methodology section: How does the scenario dictate the sources of data?
There needs to be data with clues to Crimsonia present on the infected
machine. Because Berylia is the team conducting the investigation, and
the damaged party is Revalia, somewhere between the creation and
execution of the attack, artifacts have to infect something under
Crimsonia\'s control that the blue teams can analyze. How does the
scenario dictate the most likely available resources and tools? All
tools need to be available open source, as not all teams have licensed
forensics programs. Because the infected machine will be Windows 10, any
tools used to deliver or execute the attack need to exploit Windows 10
vulnerabilities. Additionally, because the network includes various
systems, it is advantageous for the delivery mechanism to be capable of
delivering to more than one operating system. How does the scenario
create, maintain, and require communication channels? The scenario
requires Blue Teams to present proof of attribution of an attack to the
victim party, Revalia. This means that the teams need to log and keep
proof of their acquisition and analysis activities. It requires them to
give a persuasive report to a legal team. Because the scenario will
occur **[[within an ongoing conflict with
Crimsonia]{.underline}]{.mark}**, prioritization may require stop/start
of analysis. **[[There is a]{.mark}lso [high risk of a loss of
communication]{.mark} channels]{.underline}** during the analysis
process. How does the scenario restrict and manage incident and response
times? Teams will be limited to the timeline of the exercise, with one
day provided for acquisition and two for analysis and presentation of
findings. The incident response time may speed up depending on
escalation of attacks. Because there is a media team involved in the
exercise \[34\], digital forensics teams will be pushed to present
findings quicker in order to prevent the entrance of Revalia into the
conflict. This allows for the use of techniques that are speedier over
safer, such as live analysis. How does the scenario shape the physical
and logical environment? There are at least three separate government
networks involved in the scenario\-- Crimsonia, Revalia, and Berylia.
This means three public address spaces. Operating systems will be
heterogeneous. The teams themselves will operate from all over the world
over virtual networks/ virtual machines. This means the acquisition will
also be virtual. Teams need to choose a form of connecting to the
virtual machines, such as Secure Shell (SSH) or Remote Desktop Protocol
(RDP). Launching the Attack In developing the injects, step one is
mapping what effects of the incident would create analysis challenges
that mapped to the goals outlined in Section 1, the methodology
discussed above, and the overall Locked Shields 2016 scenario. The
thesis author and her team of three digital forensics designers have to
create a challenge that fulfills as many of them as possible within the
confines of the overall Locked Shields 2016 scenario. This means that
any scenario needs to incorporate an image, a web site, a Windows 10
machine, and a malware file. The scenario itself needs to include three
actors in the execution of the attack: Crimsonia, Berylia, and Revalia.
The easiest way to do this is to literally turn Berylia into the
executor of the attack by turning one or more of its machines into
botnets, because "bots run almost exclusively on Windows" \[35\].
Ideally, **[[Crimsonia will deliver malware that gives it]{.mark}
command and [control over a Berylian system and execute the attack on
Revalia]{.mark}]{.underline}** from the machine. Windows 10, being a
relatively new system, is fairly secure to well known malware; however,
it is important to recall that botnet programs originally were not
intended to be malicious. **[Remote control programs are advantageous to
administrators, and thus they exist for all versions of operating
systems. Malicious attackers take advantage of these programs and use
them to gain control over systems to which they are unauthorized to
access]{.underline}** \[35\]. Such a program could be used to gain
control over a Crimsonian machine. According to this thesis\' selected
methodology, the attack on Revalia needs to include a website and an
image. One of **[the most common forms of [cyber attack\[s\] conducted
against government entities]{.mark}]{.underline}** is website defacement
\[36\]. These attacks **[[are]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[often semantic
attacks, [directed at disseminating false information and inciting
fear]{.mark} or anger]{.underline}** \[36\]. This matched the scenario
well. Thus, [[Crimsonia will deface the Revalian government website with
an image that linked to Berylia]{.underline}.]{.mark} For this to occur,
the Revalian website needs some type of a vulnerability to exploit. The
five most common web server vulnerabilities are remote code injection,
Structured Query Language (SQL) injection, format string
vulnerabilities, cross-site scripting, and username enumeration \[37\].
The purpose of the vulnerability is for Crimsonia to deface the website
with an image. SQL injection is enough to do this; however, if the
designers want the image to do anything beyond that (i.e. execute some
type of code), then the server also needs to be vulnerable to cross-site
scripting. For Locked Shields, the thesis author and fellow designers
tested a multitude of Wordpress exploits and discovered one that works
on Windows 10. This exploit relies on a compromised plugin called
RevSlider version 4.1.1. The attacker uses the infected machine to
browse to the victim web-server with the additional command
/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?
action=revslider_show_image&img=../wp-config.php. This downloads the
file with the database credentials, such that the attacker obtains login
information for the server and uses it to deface the website with the
image \[38\]. Delivering the Attack In order for the attack to occur in
this manner, first Crimsonia needs to turn a Berylian computer into a
Botnet. There are many ways to do this. The delivery mechanism has to be
one that adds evidence in a way that helped test the skills listed in
Table 1. Because network analysis is a key skill, the delivery mechanism
should introduce network traffic. Additionally, the environment contains
multiple hosts and operating systems, so the delivery mechanism has to
be easy to multiply and deliverable to multiple operating systems, thus
ruling out operating system specific deliveries. Options for this
include e-mail, ftp, video chat, voice over IP, advertising, and social
media sites. Because in this type of exercise the designers need to
trick the victim machine user into downloading some type of malware,
email is a wise choice, essentially because it is easy to disguise an
executable attachment as a pdf in Microsoft Outlook. For the specific
email, it needs to be something a user would want to read and would
realistically download an attachment from while at work. Phishing emails
are specifcially written to convince a target that they come from a
trustworthy source \[39\]. The most common subjects of these emails
include online payments, security violations, and IT department messages
\[39\]. It is important that the email make sense in the context of the
exercise scenario. Given that the workers are drone research scientists
in the Locked Shields scenario, the email needs to be clever enough to
trick someone whose organization is heavily concerned with security. In
specifically targeted attacks like this one, attackers favor Spear
Phishing as the attack vector \[40\]. Spear Phishing campaigns use
information gathered about individuals to compose communications that
appear personal and legitimate in nature \[40\]. That this email be
intricately supported by the scenario is important, as previous exercise
reviews cited competing teams\' decreased motivation when the event did
not seem realistic \[41\]. This also means there needs to be a
background story on how the attacker conducted the reconnaissance for
the spear phishing attack. For Locked Shields 2016 this thesis\' author
and her fellow designers created an accountant persona within the
organization. The accountant has a Facebook account that registers her
as an employee in the drone organization, as does the victim machine
user. The user and the accountant are friends. Facebook and similar
social networking sites are primary resources of reconnaissance, because
they list not only personal information that allow attackers to craft
convincing emails, but they also show the relationships between people
that can be utilized in a spear phishing attack \[40\]. In order to be
plausible, the designers need to create some email history between the
accountant and the user from their work email accounts, supporting their
work relationship. For the attack, the attacker makes an email account
that looks similar to the victim\'s friend\'s legitimate email. This is
normally done by changing one or two letters in the domain name \[42\].
The email itself needs a legitimate excuse to have an attachment. For
this scenario, because the designers chose an accountant, they will send
him an email from his friend the accountant asking if he could view the
invoice that she received from an executive within the company. The real
domain name for the victim\'s workplace droneworld.site, and the
attacker\'s domain will be dronevvorld.site, replacing the letter w with
two of the letter v.

This leads to the question of what malware to use in order to turn the
target machine into a bot. [[According to]{.mark} the head digital
forensics inject developer for [the NATO Cyber Centre of
Excellence,]{.mark}]{.underline} the main criteria for selecting the
malware is that it is open source, reliable, supports file download and
upload, enables encryption, and is easily customizable \[38\]. [Open
source malware has a few advantages]{.underline}. First, the code is
simple to modify to meet the exercise\'s needs, including leaving clues.
Second, it is usually accompanied by explanations of its use. Finally,
with open source malware there is little risk of an unknown developer
backdoor that could compromise the exercise \[38\]. This also supports
the reliability of the malware. The malware should also be proven
reliable by testing it thoroughly for bugs. Features important to the
malware include file upload and download, because the attacker needs to
deliver artifacts to the victim in order for it to upload the defacing
image to the web server. In order for the network analysis part of the
exercise to present a decent challenge, it also needs to be possible to
encrypt the communication between the attacker and the bot \[38\].
Finally, because exercises requires the designers to leave specific
clues for the teams, the malware needs to be easily customizable. Areas
that the designer will want to customize include metadata, file
location, ports, and process names \[38\]. A Remote Access Trojan (RAT)
that meets this criteria is the Qaesar RAT, which was used in the 2015
Locked Shields and the designers decided to reuse in a modified manner
in the 2016 exercise. Additionally, the RAT allows for encrypted file
upload and download, an essential part of the scenario \[38\]. Once the
RAT takes over the machine, it will use this encrypted channel to
download files, such as the defacing image. File Theft Recall that a
large constraint in government cyber exercises is the need to prioritize
and respond to political concerns. Locked Shields incorporated this by
making the discovery of leaked documents a priority. Thus, the teams
will need to discover if and what documents the Crimsonians copied from
the infected machine. Because the RAT uses encrypted file download, this
presents a challenge. The two day exercise is not enough time for teams
to decrypt the file upload, and just timestamps are not enough to
identify copied documents, since in the scenario the Windows 10 user is
unaware of the system\'s compromise for an extended period of
time\[38\]. Thus, the process of copying the files needs to leave clues.
Because a main goal of the exercise is the use of system administration
tools, this can be integrated into this section of the exercise by
executing a process. The thesis author crafted a python script that
walks the Windows 10 user\'s directories for a keyword in the file names
(in this scenario, "drone") and copies those files to a new folder. When
the attacker downloads the image to the victim, he also downloads this
script. After its execution, he will upload the entire folder using the
RAT. After file upload, the entire folder will be deleted. This entire
process leaves various clues for the teams. The script is shown below:

### I/L \-\-- Misattribution

#### Official NATO policy is that a country doesn't need to prove attribution to engage in offensive responses to cyberattacks.

Cyber threats to the security of the Alliance are becoming more
frequent, complex, destructive, and coercive. [[NATO will
continue]{.underline}]{.mark} to adapt to the evolving cyber threat
landscape, which is affected by both state and non-state actors,
including state-sponsored. Cyber defence is part of NATO's core task of
collective defence. We must be able to operate as effectively in
cyberspace as we do in the air, on land, and at sea to strengthen and
support the Alliance's overall deterrence and defence posture.
[We]{.underline} therefore [continue to implement cyberspace as a domain
of operations]{.underline}. We have agreed how to integrate sovereign
cyber effects, provided voluntarily by Allies, into Alliance operations
and missions, in the framework of strong political oversight.
Reaffirming NATO's defensive mandate, [we are determined to employ the
full range of capabilities, including cyber,]{.underline} to deter,
defend against, and [[to counter the full spectrum of cyber
threats]{.mark},]{.underline} including those conducted as part of a
hybrid campaign. We need to bolster our intelligence-led situational
awareness to support NATO's decision-making and action. We continue to
work together to develop measures which would enable us to impose costs
on those who harm us. [**Individual [Allies may consider]{.mark}, when
appropriate, [attributing malicious cyber activity]{.mark}** [and
**responding in a coordinated manner**, recognising **attribution is a
sovereign national prerogative**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [We are
determined to deliver strong national cyber defences through full
implementation of the Cyber Defence Pledge, which is central to
enhancing cyber resilience and raising the costs of a cyber
attack.]{.underline} We reaffirm our commitment to act in accordance
with international law, including the UN Charter, international
humanitarian law, and human rights law, as applicable. We also support
work to maintain international peace and security in cyberspace and to
promote stability and reduce the risk of conflict, recognising that we
all stand to benefit from a norms-based, predictable, and secure
cyberspace. [We will further develop our partnership with industry and
academia from all Allies]{.underline} to keep pace with technological
advances through innovation.

Third, the authors note that attribution and response are measures for
counteracting cyberattacks. The report also states that "NATO members'
NC3 architecture is secure and reliable is of particular importance for
deterrence purposes. Even when the Alliance's NC3 systems are under
attack, all member states should be able to demonstrate their detection,
forensics and response capabilities..." The report fails, however, to
make any mention of the fact that, as of today, [no international legal
mech]{.underline}anism[s have been created as a framework for
considering and assessing dangerous ICT incidents]{.underline}; equally,
[there is no system in place for recording the facts related to those
incidents]{.underline}. [Many famous cases]{.underline} of establishing
the culpability of a particular state in various ICT-related incidents
resorted to [so-called ["public attribution]{.mark}]{.underline}": [[in
the absence of legally significant facts and due process, the guilty
party was "appointed" on]{.mark} the basis of **[political
considerations]{.mark}**]{.underline} and subjected to various measures.
[A [rapid and precise]{.mark} ICT [attribution]{.mark} has been and
[is]{.mark} a rather [**labour-intensive**]{.mark}
procedure]{.underline}. The authors state that "offensive cyber
capabilities are without doubt highly sophisticated at present, and such
capabilities are in the hands of a small number of actors." One can
hardly agree with this statement since, in some estimates, [over 60
countries have cyber weapons today]{.underline}. It is very difficult to
assess how sophisticated a particular country's capabilities are. [The
number of actors]{.underline} in possession of cyber weapons [keeps
growing]{.underline}, [this making attribution]{.underline} even [more
difficult]{.underline} and entailing higher risks of misinterpretation
and incorrect response. [**[NATO is]{.mark} already** [known to view
cyberspace as a fully-fledged operational ground and the Alliance is
building up its military potential in cyberspace]{.mark}]{.underline},
while several of its member states have already formed specialised
military units.

#### Lack of standards for attribution in the context of article 5 risks escalation due to non-state actors.

[[When is a cyberattack a NATO Article 5 issue?]{.mark}]{.underline}
Perhaps [the **biggest elephant in the room** is **[what level of proof
would trigger an Article 5 activation]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Experienced cyber security analysts admit that attribution is not just
hard but virtually impossible. [[The cyberattack on German
politicians]{.underline}]{.mark} last year [[is a good
example]{.underline}. [Within days]{.underline}]{.mark} of the first set
of leaked data, [[security vendors were claiming this was a nation state
attack]{.underline}]{.mark}. Many claimed to have seen indicators
pointing to different nation state groups. Unfortunately, what they saw
was recycled code that they misinterpreted in a rush to make public
comment. As we now know, [[the attack came from a]{.mark} disenchanted
[teenager]{.mark} who taught himself to attack]{.underline}. Would the
initial attribution in that case meet the standard for an Article 5
response? If not NATO, would it meet the new EU standard for a
collective response? Would anyone have waited for more considered review
of the data or would they have treated the claims by security vendors as
absolute proof? And here is the heart of the problem[. It is **not
hard** to insert code snippets or use **known techniques** that belong
to specific hacking groups]{.underline}. It is just as easy to fake
attack vectors to make an attack look as if it came from a specific
location. [This means]{.underline} that [[it is possible for **an
individual** to create an attack **that could start a cyber
war**]{.mark} just [because they were bored]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [Any
**response has to be**]{.underline}]{.mark} **[a
[measured]{.mark}]{.underline}** one [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} that
means [[hav]{.mark}ing plenty of [provable and trusted
intelligence]{.mark}]{.underline}. A missile strike or tanks moving over
a border is easy to attribute, unless they are simply overly diligent
members of armed units who take their tanks home with them
(Ukraine/Russia). We cannot say the same thing about cyberattacks. NATO
will have to develop better ways of attributing attacks. Enterprise
Times: What does this mean Stoltenberg is making the right noises and he
is absolutely right in that NATO needs to treat cyberspace as just
another theatre of warfare. Unfortunately, there are a lot of missing
parts here that will take time to develop and prove. We have seen [[poor
and mistaken attribution]{.underline}]{.mark} that, [if acted
upon]{.underline}, [[could]{.underline}]{.mark} have
[[provoke]{.underline}]{.mark}d [a]{.underline} more **[[serious
incident]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In addition, how do you separate a
nation state attack from nation state support for cyber criminals? The
latter creates a very complex landscape, one that we see with the West's
approach to Iran and its allies in the Middle East. Given that there is
already a cyber element to that problem, why have we not seen a highly
visible cyber response? We are in an era where [cyber warfare and
defence are becoming top level areas for investment]{.underline}.
However, **[[the consequences of getting it wrong could be
devastating]{.mark} on a world dependent on the Internet and
connectivity]{.underline}**. It will be interesting to see how Russia,
China and other countries respond to Stoltenberg's article.

\*we do not endorse ableist language

For the past several years, the U.S. Department of Defense has been
exploring how it could employ its own very robust cyberattack
capabilities to compromise or destroy enemy missiles from such states as
North Korea before they can be fired, a strategy sometimes called "left
of launch."3 Russia and China can assume, on this basis, that their own
launch facilities are being probed for such vulnerabilities, presumably
leading them to adopt escalatory policies such as those espoused in the
2018 NPR report. Wherever one looks, therefore, [the **links between
cyberwar and nuclear war are growing**]{.underline}.

The Nuclear-Cyber Connection

These links exist because the [[NC3 systems]{.underline}
[of]{.underline}]{.mark} the United States and other [[nuclear-armed
states are]{.mark} heavily dependent on]{.underline} computers and other
digital [processors]{.underline} [for]{.underline} virtually [every
aspect of]{.underline} their [operation and]{.underline} because those
systems [are [**highly vulnerable to cyberattack**.]{.mark}]{.underline}
Every nuclear force is composed, most basically, of weapons,
early-warning radars, launch facilities, and the top officials, usually
presidents or prime ministers, empowered to initiate a nuclear exchange.
Connecting them all, however, is an extended network of communications
and data-processing systems, all reliant on cyberspace. Warning systems,
ground- and space-based, must constantly watch for and analyze possible
enemy missile launches. Data on actual threats must rapidly be
communicated to decision-makers, who must then weigh possible responses
and communicate chosen outcomes to launch facilities, which in turn must
provide attack vectors to delivery systems. All of this involves
operations in cyberspace, and it is in this domain that great power
rivals seek vulnerabilities to exploit in a constant struggle for
advantage.

The use of cyberspace to gain an advantage over adversaries takes many
forms and is not always aimed at nuclear systems. China has been accused
of engaging in widespread cyberespionage to steal technical secrets from
U.S. firms for economic and military advantages. Russia has been
accused, most extensively in the Robert Mueller report, of exploiting
cyberspace to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Nonstate
actors, including terrorist groups such as al Qaeda and the Islamic
State group, have used the internet for recruiting combatants and
spreading fear. Criminal groups, including some thought to be allied
with state actors, such as North Korea, have used cyberspace to extort
money from banks, municipalities, and individuals.4 Attacks such as
these occupy most of the time and attention of civilian and military
cybersecurity organizations that attempt to thwart such attacks. Yet for
those who worry about strategic stability and the risks of nuclear
escalation, it is the threat of cyberattacks on NC3 systems that
provokes the greatest concern.

commander of U.S. Cyber Command, testifies during a Senate Armed
Services Committee hearing on February 14. He warned that China and
Russia are conducting sustained cybercampaigns against the United
States. (Photo: Mark Wilson/Getty Images)This concern stems from the
fact that, despite the immense effort devoted to protecting NC3 systems
from cyberattack, no enterprise that relies so extensively on computers
and cyberspace can be made 100 percent invulnerable to attack. This is
so because such systems employ many devices and operating systems of
various origins and vintages, most incorporating numerous software
updates and "patches" over time, offering multiple vectors for attack.
Electronic components can also be modified by hostile actors during
production, transit, or insertion; and the whole system itself is
dependent to a considerable degree on the electrical grid, which itself
is vulnerable to cyberattack and is far less protected. Experienced
"cyberwarriors" of every major power have been working for years to
probe for weaknesses in these systems and in many cases have devised
cyberweapons, typically, malicious software (malware) and computer
viruses, to exploit those weaknesses for military advantage.5

Although activity in cyberspace is much more difficult to detect and
track than conventional military operations, enough information has
become public to indicate that the major nuclear powers, notably
[[**China**, **Russia**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and [[the
**U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates, along
with such secondary powers as [[**Iran** and
**No**]{.underline}]{.mark}rth **[[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}**rea,
[[have]{.mark} established]{.underline} extensive cyberwarfare
capabilities and engage in **[[offensive
cyberoperations]{.underline}]{.mark}** on a regular basis, often [[aimed
at **critical military infrastructure**.]{.underline}]{.mark}
"Cyberspace is a contested environment where we are in constant contact
with adversaries," General Paul M. Nakasone, commander of the U.S. Cyber
Command (Cybercom), told the Senate Armed Services Committee in February
2019. "We see near-peer competitors \[China and Russia\] conducting
sustained campaigns below the level of armed conflict to erode American
strength and gain strategic advantage."

Although eager to speak of adversary threats to U.S. interests, Nakasone
was noticeably but not surprisingly reluctant to say much about U.S.
offensive operations in cyberspace. He acknowledged, however, that
Cybercom took such action to disrupt possible Russian interference in
the 2018 midterm elections. "We created a persistent presence in
cyberspace to monitor adversary actions and crafted tools and tactics to
frustrate their efforts," he testified in February. According to press
accounts, this included a cyberattack aimed at paralyzing the Internet
Research Agency, a "troll farm" in St. Petersburg said to have been
deeply involved in generating disruptive propaganda during the 2016
presidential elections.6

Other press investigations have disclosed two other offensive operations
undertaken by the United States. One called "Olympic Games" was intended
to disrupt Iran's drive to increase its uranium-enrichment capacity by
sabotaging the centrifuges used in the process by infecting them with
the so-called Stuxnet virus. Another left of launch effort was intended
to cause malfunctions in North Korean missile tests.7 Although not aimed
at either of the U.S. principal nuclear adversaries, those two attacks
demonstrated a willingness and capacity to conduct cyberattacks on the
nuclear infrastructure of other states.

Efforts by strategic rivals of the United States to infiltrate and
eventually degrade U.S. nuclear infrastructure are far less documented
but thought to be no less prevalent. Russia, for example, is believed to
have planted malware in the U.S. electrical utility grid, possibly with
the intent of cutting off the flow of electricity to critical NC3
facilities in the event of a major crisis.8 Indeed, every major power,
including the United States, is believed to have crafted cyberweapons
aimed at critical NC3 components and to have implanted malware in enemy
systems for potential use in some future confrontation.

Pathways to Escalation

Knowing that the NC3 systems of the major powers are constantly being
probed for weaknesses and probably infested with malware designed to be
activated in a crisis, what does this say about the risks of escalation
from a nonkinetic battle, that is, one fought without traditional
weaponry, to a kinetic one, at first using conventional weapons and
then, potentially, nuclear ones? None of this can be predicted in
advance, but those analysts who have studied the subject worry about the
emergence of dangerous new pathways for escalation. Indeed, several such
scenarios have been identified.9

[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} first and possibly [[**most dangerous path to
escalation** would arise from]{.mark} the [**early use** of cyberweapons
in a great power crisis]{.mark}]{.underline} to ~~paralyze~~ the vital
command, control, and communications capabilities of an adversary, many
of which serve nuclear and conventional forces. In the "fog of war" that
would naturally ensue from such an encounter, [the
recipient]{.underline} of such an attack [might fear more punishing
follow-up kinetic attacks, possibly **including the use of nuclear
weapons**]{.underline}, and, fearing the loss of its own arsenal, launch
its weapons immediately. [[This might occur]{.underline}]{.mark}, for
example, [[in]{.mark} a **confrontation between [NATO]{.mark} and
Russian forces**]{.underline} in east and central Europe or between U.S.
and Chinese forces in the Asia-Pacific region.

Speaking of a possible confrontation in Europe, for example, James N.
Miller Jr. and Richard Fontaine wrote that "both sides would have
overwhelming incentives to go early with offensive cyber and
counter-space capabilities to negate the other side's military
capabilities or advantages." If these early attacks succeeded, "it could
result in huge military and coercive advantage for the attacker." This
might induce the recipient of such attacks to back down, affording its
rival a major victory at very low cost. Alternatively, however, [[the
recipient might view]{.mark} the [attacks]{.mark}]{.underline} on its
critical command, control, and communications infrastructure [[as the
**prelude to a full-scale attack**]{.mark}]{.underline} aimed at
neutralizing its nuclear capabilities [[and]{.mark} **choose to [strike
first]{.mark}**]{.underline}. "It is worth considering," Miller and
Fontaine concluded, "how [even a very limited attack or incident could
set both sides on a **slippery slope to rapid
escalation**]{.underline}."10

photo by Master Sgt. Renae Pittman)What makes [the insertion of latent
malware in an adversary's NC3 systems so dangerous is that it may not
even need to be activated to increase the risk of nuclear
escalation]{.underline}. [If a nuclear-armed state comes to believe that
its critical systems are infested with enemy malware, its [leaders
might]{.mark} not trust the info]{.underline}rmation provided by its
early-warning systems in a crisis and might misconstrue the nature of an
enemy attack, [leading them to [overreact and]{.mark} possibly
[launch]{.mark} their [nuclear weapons out of fear they are **at risk of
a preemptive strike**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

"[The uncertainty caused]{.underline} by the unique character of a cyber
threat [could **jeopardize the credibility of the nuclear deterrent**
and **undermine strategic stability** in ways that advances in nuclear
and conventional weapons do not]{.underline}," Page O. Stoutland and
Samantha Pitts-Kiefer wrote in 2018 paper for the Nuclear Threat
Initiative. "\[T\]he introduction of a flaw or malicious code into
nuclear weapons through the supply chain that compromises the
effectiveness of those weapons could lead to a lack of confidence in the
nuclear deterrent," undermining strategic stability.11 Without
confidence in the reliability of its nuclear weapons infrastructure, a
nuclear-armed state may misinterpret confusing signals from its
early-warning systems and, fearing the worst, launch its own nuclear
weapons rather than lose them to an enemy's first strike. This makes the
scenario proffered in the 2018 NPR report, of a nuclear response to an
enemy cyberattack, that much more alarming.

[[War simulations]{.underline}]{.mark}, commonly known as war games,
[have been in use]{.underline} in some form [since humanity first went
to war.]{.underline} The Roman infantry designed training that would
take into consideration political and strategic aspects alongside
operational and tactical ones (Sabin, 2009). Similarly, there exists
wide agreement on ascribing Prussian war successes also to the
sophistication of its army's kriegsspiele1 (Boot, 2006). [Players use
these simulations to ultimately test, as well as [refine, norms and
tactics of warfare]{.mark} while strengthening defence mechanisms and
international cooperation amongst allies.]{.underline} [In attempts to
reduce the distance between reality and fiction, i.e. the 'original' and
its 'copy',]{.underline} military planners have for many years included
political, legal and social aspects into the modelling of fictional war
scenarios (Harrigan, et al. 2016).

[As contemporary warfare moves towards hybrid and non-linear forms of
confrontation]{.underline} (see Keegan, 1993; McCuen, 2008), however,
[realistic modelling increasingly clashes with the actual realities of
war. Often characterized by remoteness and unpredictability,
contemporary warfare escapes or supersedes those traditional elements
that would qualify war as a peculiar instance of violence: corporeal
proximity, ethics, territory/battlefield, and sovereignty.]{.underline}
[If]{.underline} on one hand, [in postmodern societies everything seems
to have become war through the militarization of everyday
life]{.underline} (cfr. Brooks, 2016), on the other hand [[remoteness
and disembodiment]{.mark} tend to obfuscate and [separate]{.mark} the
event of [war from direct experience and
perception]{.mark}]{.underline}, and also emotionally2 (see Butler,
2009). [Technological innovations, alongside strategic and tactical
ones, reshape the extent and speed in which war can be con- ducted,
experienced, and thus abstracted into realistic simulated
narratives]{.underline} (Virilio, 2000; Singer, 2009). For these
reasons, singling out contextual features --- and elaborating them into
simulated scenarios --- clashes with the increasingly remote and hybrid
realities of war.

As remoteness poses serious limitations to the possibility of
abstracting war into realistic exercises, simulated game scenarios
increasingly relate to reality nonlinearly. While becoming detached from
reality on one hand, on the other they constitute a privileged point of
view to understand how different actors imagine new and future wars, and
make sense of them through the construction of these semi- fictional
cultural artefacts. In particular, **[the recent emergence of
[cyberwar]{.mark} as a new potential threat to the security of states
[has triggered the proliferation of simulation games]{.mark} that are
primarily concerned with strengthening national cybersecurity
apparatuses.]{.underline}** **[In a context of war defined by remoteness
par excellence, and characterized by ever-changing techniques of attack
as well as by secrecy and anonymity, [game scenarios]{.mark} lean
towards purely fictional imaginaries]{.underline}** or, **[at best, they
[reproduce cyberwar according to cultural schemes that precede its
existence]{.mark} in practice.]{.underline}** In light of these schemes,
however, scholarship overall agrees that **[cyberwar never
occurred]{.underline}** (Rid, 2013), thus removing any comprehensive
point of reference with the past (and the possibility of linear
simulation).

The unavailability or absence of univocal contextual variables (such as
a delimited battlefield or clear state attribution online), as well as
of substantial past experiences, appears to shape the modelling of
cyberwar games towards operational and tactical elements rather than
political and strategic ones. If compared to traditional war exercises,
the operational dimension of cyberwar can be fully simulated in
realistic terms: gameplay usually engages with actual cyberattacks
targeting existing national cyber-infrastructures, in order to test
their responsiveness to the threats. On the other hand, [game
scenarios]{.underline} --- setting the political and cultural context in
which cyberwar games would unfold --- [maintain a less clear
relationship to existing past experiences of cyberwar]{.underline},
being often the result of how game planners imagine possible future
wars**[. As copies without a clear original, [these scenarios create
narratives of war]{.mark} that are [not]{.mark} necessarily [dependent
on reality]{.mark}]{.underline}** (thus produ- cing a new one), while
conveying insights on operational defence mechanisms and players'
cultural understanding of this context of war.
**[Cyberwar]{.underline}**, in other words, **[raises the question on
how to simulate a phenomenon that possesses an ambivalent relation to
reality]{.underline}** --- and differs significantly from other
experiences of war. Looking at a selection of scenarios of major
national and international cyberwar games as illustrations, this
article, first, engages with the modes of existence of simulated
cyberwar through the conceptual prisms of copy/original and
simulation/simulacrum; second, explores how these scenarios frame
cyberwar in relation to cyberwar- fare scholarship and legislation; and
third, sheds light on how, through operational exercises, these
scenarios ultimately reproduce cyberwar as an imagined cultural
artefact.

Simulated scenarios as cultural artefacts

[Simulations abstract and reproduce an original]{.underline}. The
creation of simulation models aims, in fact, to single out original
elements in order to reproduce a known, recog- nizable, or at least
plausible, phenomenon and its situational elements through a scenario
(Hilgers, 2012). [As much as the intrinsic ambition of any game
simulation remains the creation of an exact copy of the original, its
process of abstraction and modelling can only be partial: an accurate
map would never be the exact copy of a territory, a very realistic war
videogame could never reproduce the suffering associated with
wars.]{.underline}

These processes of abstraction generally occur by creating synthetic and
aggre- gated indexes meant to summarize all data (Gardner, 1970), inputs
and outputs involved in a complex process (also for evaluating
performances). The difficulty of singling out indexes and parameters,
before reproducing them into models, de facto increases exponentially in
the context of multifaceted social phenomena and, even more so, when
these are characterized by remoteness, as in the case of cyberwar. In
general terms, [the modelling through abstraction of specific and
limited features of a controlled context overemphasizes those
objectifiable technical and mechanical aspects to the detriment of its
nuanced political and social elements]{.underline}. For these reasons,
[simulations of social phenomena tend to rely on the reproduction of
those operational aspects that are most clearly available to knowledge
production and performance evaluation.]{.underline} For example, whereas
the accuracy of game scenarios relating to natural disaster management
appears to be effective in controlling realis- tic process variables,
this appears not to be the case in the context of exercises dealing with
terror attacks, where parameters continuously disrupt routines and rep-
etitions to a greater extent.

In order [to account for the political and social complexities of war,
scenario setting becomes a fundamental aspect of game
planning]{.underline} (Crogran, 2011). [Widening scenarios]{.underline}
--- towards the inclusion of non-operational military elements ---
[purports to capture and reproduce the phenomenon of war in more
accurate and holistic ways, and thus anticipate and predict future
circumstances.]{.underline} [Because of this, creating simulated
scenarios heavily depends on knowledge of]{.underline} (and data about)
[past experiences in pursuit of improved future
performances]{.underline} (Bødker, 2000). In this sense, scenarios
maintain a double relation with time and knowledge production: on one
hand, they draw upon past and present contextual elements to create
realistic approxi- mations of war while, on the other, they attempt to
anticipate new realities. [Whereas the design of a simulation scenario
depends on a profound knowledge of those contextual elements and
variables that define a specific instance of war, its simulated
reproduction holds to the ambition of creating applicable operational
knowledge]{.underline} (Sabin, 2007). In other words, **[reality and
fiction maintain a circular relationship, feeding each other through
gameplay.]{.underline}**

[Game scenarios enable the gameplay of war through the creation of
narratives.]{.underline} Whether fully fictional --- such as the Israel
Defence Forces' 2016 Star Wars, and 2017 Pokémon themed cyber-exercises
--- or reminiscent of the actual dynamics of international relations ---
**[[as in the case of cyberattacks targeting]{.mark} the fictional
country of [Berylia]{.mark}]{.underline}** (NATO's 2016 Locked Shield)
--- [[these stories provide the frame in which operational aspects of
the simulation unfold]{.mark}.]{.underline} Paul Virilio (1991)
describes a frame as the limit to visibility, the cultural gesture that
makes conscious objectification possible. [Frames determine visibility
and specific understandings of reality, with the inevitable risk of
partiality and epistemic blindness. By fictionalizing war into a
gameplay narrative, game scenarios become cultural products that possess
their own existence in relation to the phenomenon or event they purport
to simulate]{.underline}. As the remoteness of cyberwar precludes, to a
great extent, a linear abstraction of this phenomenon into simulated
outcomes, [the circular relationship between fiction and reality
interrupts to make space for a merged cultural hyperreal outcome: the
game scenario.]{.underline}

In his philosophical treatises, The System of Objects (Baudrillard,
2005, first pub- lished in 1968), then developed with Simulacra and
Simulations (Baudrillard, 1994, first published in 1981), Jean
[Baudrillard]{.underline} lays down a theory of culture that, in late
capitalism, appears to be defined and dominated by simulations. More
specifically, he [contends that contemporary abstractions are not
linearly connected to their originals, to a definable referential being.
Whereas simulations imitate the operations that are peculiar to a
system]{.underline} or a world process (and that can be observed through
time and space), [the increasing merging of different characterizations
of reality]{.underline} --- the hyperreal --- [obfuscates these
processes and the possibility to relate them to original
signifiers]{.underline} (Baudrillard, 1994, first published in 1981).
For these reasons[, their copies become simulacra: artefacts that exist
independently from an original reference, or where the point of contact
with the original reference has dis- appeared.]{.underline} Accordingly,
Baudrillard theorizes these two elements not as two mutually
exclusionary characterizations of being, but rather as two dynamic and
shifting depictions of reality. In a graphic visualization, they could
be understood as the two moving extrema of a whole spectrum enclosing
progressive phases that maintain different distances between copy and
original --- through an incremental liquidation of all referentials.
[Whereas at the first stage the copy maintains a pro- found similarity
to its original]{.underline}, thus making them perceived as
indissoluble, [in its second stage the copy is distanced from the
original and becomes a 'perversion of reality': copy and original do not
correspond anymore]{.underline} but are nevertheless con- nected through
unclear, however present, common referentials. Moving forward,
Baudrillard then situates the 'order of sorcery', [the third stage where
the copy pre- tends to be the original but has in fact lost its
essential aspect of representation]{.underline} (the two stops having a
discernible connection). [In the fourth and last stage, simulation
becomes pure 'simulacrum'. A simulacrum has no relationship or pretence
to simulate, its symbolic form constitutes a new mode of existence that
is fully equivalent to the real, i.e. a hyperreal. [Being detached from
an original, the simulacrum becomes itself an original, and thus
a]{.mark} possible [point of reference to be
simulated.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The distinction between simulation and simulacrum does not only engage
differ- ent characterizations of reality, their historical evolution or
the relationship between an original and its copy. Baudrillard's work
represents in fact a broader reflection on how cultural products are
generated in relation to symbols or events (and expec- tations thereof),
as well as the extent to which these symbolic forms become unique points
of reference on which human experiences are based in the construc- tion
of what Lipovetski (2004) defines 'hyperreal times', (i.e. times of maps
preced- ing territories). Or, in Baudrillard's words, 'the real is
produced from miniaturized units, from matrices, memory banks and
command models --- and with these it can be reproduced an indefinite
number of times' (2001: 170). [[As war]{.mark} becomes an unavoidable
cultural condition of contemporaneity --- through remoteness and the
disappearance of bodies -- its reality [becomes detached from suffering
and direct cognition]{.mark}]{.underline} (Butler, 2009), [[and]{.mark}
thus [starts to exist only in its technical and operational dimensions.
As remoteness creates distance from]{.mark} the event of [war,
simulations]{.mark}/simulacra [of cyberwar]{.mark} appear to [depict a
reality that is]{.mark} 'nothing more than
[operational']{.mark}]{.underline} (Baudrillard, 2001: 170). At the same

[remoteness also manifests as cognitive gap, i.e. the impossibility of

Framing cyberwar outside remoteness

During the 1990s, **[the emergence of cyberwar as a new]{.underline}**
**[potential form of belligerent social interaction was accompanied by
unjustified hysteria about its imminent and devastating
potentials]{.underline}** (cfr. Arquilla & Ronfeldt, 1992; Stiennon,
2015). Fuelled by those catastrophic scenarios depicted in science
fiction literature and cinema, **[a sense of technophobia pushed
military and traditional security apparatuses to rethink and adapt their
defence strategies to the new emerging threat, and the prospects of a
forthcoming 'total war'.]{.underline}** Similarly,
[scholarship]{.underline} --- mainly produced in aca- demic circles
strongly linked to the military --- [theorized about the new
phenomenon]{.underline} along the lines of existing war doctrines, thus
deferring to those peculiar elements that relate to its remoteness: [the
apparent darkness and immateriality of the battle- field, the lack of a
physical experience of violent fighting through corporeal bodies, and
the fleetingness of its (non-sovereign) fighters]{.underline} (cfr.
Kaplan, 2016).

Instead, **[[cyberwarfare scholarship defined cyberwar as]{.mark} being
[dependent on]{.mark} the presence of those elements that characterize
war in its traditional framing: [physical violence]{.mark}, ethics,
[sovereign belligerents, and territory.]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[]{.mark}**[In most cases, the [absence of (one of) these elements led
to the conclusion that the observed phenomenon would not
constitute]{.mark} an instance of [cyberwar]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
Following this framing, **[cyberwarfare scholarship generally contended
that cyberattacks represent an instance of cyberwar only if possessing
those characteristics that traditionally define an 'act of
war'.]{.underline}** Consequently, [past **major incidents of cyber
confrontation**]{.underline} --- such as Titan Rain 2003, Estonia 2007,
and Stuxnet 20103 --- **[would not be considered instances of cyberwar
as they lacked clear state attribution or a discernible physical damage
outside cyber- space.]{.underline}** **[According to these prescriptive
understandings]{.underline}** of the phenomenon, **[cyberwar would
become a reality of war only when 'evading' its remoteness --- both from
perceptions as well as from a priori set analytical
categories]{.underline}**. To date, in fact, cyberwar has seldom (if
ever) taken place through those expected forms theorized within
mainstream scholarship on the topic. For this reason, planning a game
scenario through these very forms appears to surpass, or lag behind, its
phenomenology. In fact, this approach appears consistent with what
Massumi (2015) defines the 'logic of pre-emption': **[as threats become
increasingly remote and unknown, the [use of
force]{.mark}]{.underline}** (and the design of policy) **[[starts
depending on the fear of potentialities]{.mark}, rather than on actual
events.]{.underline}** As argued in this article, **[[attempting a
closure of the gap between the 'original' and its 'copy' requires
engagement with]{.mark} the existence of [cyber-war]{.mark} with[in its
phenomenological remoteness,]{.mark} rather than inductively depicting
its conditional existence away from it.]{.underline}**

The remoteness of cyberwar unfolds in different ways, through distances
that pertain both its phenomenological manifestation as well as its
conceptual and theoretical existence. At a first glance, **[the
intuitive distance of the event of cyberwar from human sensorial
experiences coincides with the ambiguous ontological status of
cyberspace]{.underline}** (whether it possesses physical existence or
not), **[and one of the contex- tual elements it contains]{.underline}**
(targeted websites, cyber-weapons, data etc.). In fact, these elements
are not directly observable, and thus are not 'available' to abstraction
in a traditional realist sense (cfr. Benedickt, 1991). **[This
ontological uncertainty has determined,]{.underline}** to a relevant
extent, **[how the basic notion of cyberwar has been hitherto
theorized]{.underline}** within mainstream scholarship. Relevant
**[[scholarship in military studies]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Rowe, 2010;
Libicki, 2009; Lucas, 2012), **[[international
law]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Schmitt, 2014; Hoi- sington, 2009; Koh,
2012) **[[and cybersecurity]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Singer & Friedman,
2014) **[[concur on a categorization of cyberwar that
favours]{.underline}]{.mark}**, first of all, **[the [physical
damage]{.mark} caused.]{.underline}** In an attempt to combine existing
multi-disciplinary knowledge, **[[NATO]{.mark}'s Tallinn
Manual]{.underline}** --- a non-binding study about the applicability of
international law to cyberwar (updated in 2017) --- **[[brought together
legal, defence and cybersecurity experts]{.mark} in order [to draft
a]{.mark} comprehensive [manual on]{.mark} the legal and security
concerns related to [cyberwar]{.mark} (]{.underline}**NATO, 2013; NATO,
2017). **[The manual,]{.underline}** for the first time, **[categorized
different types of cyberattack]{.underline}** (separating them from
cyberespionage[) **[while associating cyberwar to]{.underline}**
]{.mark}**[degrees of [physical]{.mark} actual [harm:]{.mark} only when
a cyberattack leads to a tangible damage outside cyberspace are we
witnessing cyberwar]{.underline}** (NATO, 2013; NATO, 2017).

Similarly, **[remoteness also questions how state sovereignty (and its
limits) are to be understood in the context of virtual
conflicts.]{.underline}**4 **[Cyberattacks indiscriminately target
government, military, industrial/commercial, and civilian
infrastructures]{.underline}**. In this context, **[state responses
primarily depend on the extent to which a cyberattack comes to be
considered as an issue pertaining to national security, rather than a
crim- inal act5 that is not of direct national concern]{.underline}**
(cfr. Allhoff, et al. 2015). Discerning the two domains can be
problematic as, **[regardless of their different scopes such as criminal
theft, vandalism, malware, sophisticated espionage, or intelligence
operations, attacking and penetration techniques remain fundamentally
the same]{.underline}** (Ohlin, et al. 2015). In this spirit, [[existing
scholarship]{.underline}]{.mark} on the topic --- and the simulations
inductively inspired by this framing --- [mainly [focus on]{.mark} state
responses and prevention to the threat of cyberwar through a
[traditional]{.mark} understanding of [sovereignty,]{.mark} i.e. a
quality that pertains the state.]{.underline} Moreover, **[remoteness in
practice also dilutes sovereignty when it comes to the issue of
identifying the perpetrator of an attack: through secrecy and anonymity,
cyber-combatants uphold unclear relation- ships with national
cyber-armies, as these are in fact characterized by very fluid
membership.]{.underline}** On these grounds, **[[setting a game scenario
through clearly identifiable roles and]{.mark} national [teams]{.mark}
creates simulations that [move away from reality]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
[Despite game planners increasingly involving non-state actors in
cyberwar simulations]{.underline} (in the spirit of widening scenarios),
[roles are generally framed as interacting in relation to sovereign
powers]{.underline} (with teams or countries as belligerent parties).

[The characterization of cyberattacks as issues of national security has
come to be reproduced in reality, as well as in simulated interactions,
through [different legislative frameworks]{.mark} that purport to
capture and define the obscure ethics of cyberwar.]{.underline} Whereas
a binding cyberwar-exclusive international treaty continues to be
absent, relevant efforts point to the necessity of adapting current
legal frameworks to the issue of cyberwar. Amongst these, the UN Charter
with respect to the issue of jus ad bellum and the 1949/1977 Geneva
Protocols offer the most accurate definition of cyberwar. These updates
rethink categories --- such as legitimate use of force, state
attribution, proportionality, espionage law and the application of
international humanitarian law --- in order to adapt them to the reality
of virtual conflicts, while distinguishing cyberwar from other forms of
confrontation and intrusion online. In brief, these protocols argue that
the equation between cyberwar and traditional war depends on the extent
in which cyberattacks lead to consequences in the actual world (physical
damage) and can be linked to a sovereign (in the classical sense)
entity,6 i.e. state attribution. However, due to the absence of
substantial inter- national treaties on the topic and accountability
mechanisms, state behaviours and responses to cyberattacks remain
usually based on customary international law (Hoisington, 2009). Along
these lines, legal aspects are often included in the operational phase
of cyberwar simulations in order to train participants (military
officials, policy makers, and cybersecurity experts) to design and
implement defence responses that, while effective, would be consistent
with current domestic and international legislations (mainly in order to
maintain responses' proportional- ity and lawfulness).

These traditional definitions of cyberwar also determine and engage with
how game simulations imagine national territories to exist in virtual
realms. [Traditional scholarship, and legislations, concur on
[transpos]{.mark}ing [traditional defence mechanisms]{.mark} (and their
regulation) [into the cyber-realm on the assumption that state
sovereignty maintains its territorial element]{.mark} also [in virtual
settings]{.mark}.]{.underline} As exploitability depends foremost on
internet connectivity, cyber-defence strategies consist of limiting
access to national cyberspace in different ways. For example, amongst
these, a basic defence measure entails disconnecting machines from the
global internet and the establishment of a local network intended only
for military traffic (with its own internet protocol address, web
servers and domain name system), thus creating the conditions for a sort
of air gap. Of course, this infers that attacks come from a source that
is external to the system. While national authorities can alternatively
create kill-switches to disconnect the entire country/territory from the
internet, in reality this measure is often discouraged in the context of
cyberwar simulations (as it would undermine the learning experience of
the game by recurring to an easy --- yet drastic --- solution). Other
classical defence strategies are based on pre- ventive measures such as
network-embedded perimeter defences (e.g. the Linux DMZ paradigm) ---
based on segregating inside from outside packet traffic so to allow
activities only when they originate from the inside (cfr. Kott, et al.
2015). [These defence mechanisms define a correspondence between
national cyberspace and state territory, and thus set the ground for a
linear simulation. In the framing and discourse of traditional military
defence, cyberspace possesses an existence that parallels that of a
national territory --- becoming a space that can be objectified and
abstracted --- and thus, closed, fenced, or even annexed.]{.underline}

**[[Practical and tactical aspects of simulations]{.mark} are commonly
designed departing from a framing that [equate]{.mark}s
[cyber]{.mark}warfare [to traditional warfare]{.mark}, through its most
basic defining elements]{.underline}**. If on one hand, these reproduce
--- in extremely realistic ways --- those peculiar operational features
of cyberattacks, on the other hand **[they merely propose the transfer
of classical territorial defence measures into the spatial 'disorder' of
cyberspace.]{.underline}** **[The [emphasis on traditional signifiers of
war]{.mark} --- and the difficulties related to abstracting these in the
context of cyberspace --- [results in the design of simulation games
that privilege technical and operational elements over political and
strategic ones]{.mark}.]{.underline}** In this spirit, and similarly to
real-world dynamics, industrial and commercial cybersecurity expertise
becomes increasingly co-opted into defence policy making, as well as
military training and exercises (Lucas, 2012). While this of course
stems from the ambition of fostering cooperation between different, but
interconnected, branches of society at large (dealing with very similar
attacks), **[the merging of private cybersecurity into the domain of
policy- making also appears to further advance]{.underline}** what Buley
(2007), in his analysis of the American intervention during World War
II, has defined as **[the 'de-politicization' of war.]{.underline}**
Moreover, the focus on traditional elements of war determines that only
by escaping remoteness and virtuality, and thus coming closer to the
categories that were originally designed around it, would cyberwar
become manifest in reality.

#### **Framing cyberwar in terms of physical harm done to nation-states makes NATO [more vulnerable]{.underline} to cyberattacks and [more likely]{.underline} to escalate in response to them.**

Simulacra of cyberwar

As [cyberwar has never fully occurred in reality within those frames
theorized by cyberwarfare scholarship]{.underline} (and thus not being
observable through a clear visual point of reference with the past),
game planners can only trace its 'full' original within and through this
very theoretical framing. [Designing a scenario about a
non-event]{.underline} (or a partial event), in fact, in[volves the
creation of artefacts that do not possess full and a linear resemblance
to an original model, but are instead reflective of cultural
expectations and a priori inductive theorizing about the event.
[Aligning the modes of existence of cyberwar to traditional warfare
substantiates an equation between being war and being physical]{.mark},
and in fact between being physical and being real[. This]{.mark} framing
[prescribes a clear-cut distinction between virtuality and
reality]{.mark}, as the two extremes of an ontological segment where
different instances of war are thought to exist through different
degrees of reality. As such, opposed to real-world instances of war, its
virtual versions should be considered either mere
simulations]{.underline} (cfr. Searle, 1995), i.e. having resemblance to
real-world entities by their interactive features, [or else as
ontological reproductions, i.e. possessing a real- world significance
that manifests, in this specific context, when a cyberattack causes
physical damages in the real world]{.underline} (Brey, 2007).

[[The expectation]{.mark},]{.underline} so-far unrealized, [[of a
cyberwar that would fuel large scale,]{.mark} and extremely [violent,
total wars]{.mark} often [comes to be reproduced in simulation scenarios
through the modeling of]{.mark} very [catastrophic imaginaries, which
have no]{.mark} historical [correspondence in
reality.]{.mark}]{.underline} In the aftermath of a fictional
large-scale cyberattack --- during the 2016 US cyberwar simulation Cyber
Guard (CG) --- between 1 and 10 million homes and businesses were left
without power across the country, while Los Angeles ports were shut down
due to a network outage, whilst an oil spill from a near-shore refinery
gushed into the waters off Texas and Louisiana, dama- ging the ecosystem
(Parrish, 2016). Similarly, [[the]{.mark} 2016 [simulation game Locked
Shields]{.mark}]{.underline} (LS), [[run]{.mark} annually [by
NATO]{.mark}'s Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excel- lence
(]{.underline}CCDCOE), [[was set in]{.mark} the fictional context of
[Berylia]{.mark}. A sovereign island in the Atlantic Ocean, [the
country]{.mark}'s economy mainly relied on advanced drone industries
that [had]{.mark} now [come under attack through]{.mark} repeated
cyber-assaults on their networks and industries, and the [hijacking
of]{.mark} their [drones]{.mark}, now being [used to invade the
island]{.mark} (]{.underline}CCDCOE, 2016).

[These very basic scenario elements, as well as contextualizing war
games within catastrophic narratives, also indicate that [game planners
associate cyberwar's mode of existence]{.mark}]{.underline} (Latour,
2012) [[with physical violence]{.mark}, i.e. a violence that eludes
remoteness and, emerging from a virtual and remote domain, becomes
tangible.]{.underline} Together with virtualized machines, physical
infrastructures are often miniaturized to convey a more 'realistic'
experience of cyberwar while offering the possibility of observing
simulated physical damage in real time. During an interview in 2015, an
Israeli commander of the C4i Corps (the army branch responsible for
cyber-defence) announced to the press that, in order to facilitate
realistic cyberwar simulations, a small-scale model city (named Sim
City) had been built in the premises of the Ramat Gan-based unit
(Lappin, 2015). Miniaturizing infrastructures is, in fact, a very common
practice in traditional war gaming, mainly to help planners and players
to visualize and plan strategies of deployment and movement in general.
[Yet [actual cyber confrontations increasingly]{.mark} occur in ways
that [remain]{.mark} mostly [virtualized, and do not transcend
cyberspace]{.mark}. In fact, [technological progress continues to drive
confrontation towards even greater remoteness:]{.mark} most [advanced
cyber- weapons rely heavily on automatized machines]{.mark} and software
to ignite attacks, [thus reducing]{.mark} the extent and relevance of
[human input and traditional physical force]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Brenner, 2009). [Programmed computers, intrusive malwares, and
malicious crawlers all remotely carry out wide-ranging attacks, take
down or deface websites, spy, leak information, and substantially damage
(national) cyber infrastructures, through a 'nonlinear' present human
agent underlying their launch.]{.underline}

As well as an understanding of violence that manifests as physical
experiences outside cyberspace, [cyberwar simulations tend to frame
battle through questions of national sovereignty and
territoriality.]{.underline} In this spirit, for instance, LS game plan-
ners' choice to situate Berylia 'in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean'
(CCDCOE, 2016) signals the intention to provide players with a clearly
defined and isolated ter- ritorial 'game board', at odds with the
peculiar borderless and interconnected nature of cyberspace. Designed as
a multi-lateral and scoreable game[, [NATO's]{.mark} LS
participants]{.underline} are divided into national 'blue teams' (20
teams participated in 2016) that, while based in their own country,
[play remotely in [defence of Berylia's national cyberspace]{.mark} and
industrial control systems. The scenario [enables]{.mark} teams to play
as a rapid reaction squad that has just been dropped into a drone
research lab, trying to take back control over the networks as well as
on the hijacked weaponized drones. Attackers belonging to]{.underline}
the 'red team' of rival country [Crimsonia -- selected from prominent
international cybersecurity experts -- launch over 1700 different types
of cyberattack. These attacks are updated every year and reproduce exact
copies of recently designed attacks]{.underline} (while a neutral 'white
team' of experts runs the game), making the simulation of great
relevance because of its operational dimension. Based on scoreable tasks
and continuous exponentially harder game inputs (in line with a
traditional videogaming logic), national teams compete to demonstrate
their readiness and responsiveness to cyberattacks (with Slovakia
winning the 2016 edition of the simulation game). Teams are not only
expected to counter attacks targeting their networks and
infrastructures, but also need to prove their innocence when blamed for
unauthorized attacks coming from their own networks (CCDCOE, 2016). In
fact, this detail somehow signals the problematic related to remoteness
and the designing of uniformed agency and membership in relation to
(sovereign) teams. [By associating gameplay to players' [allegiances to
an army, a group, or a team]{.mark} (and thus implying human agency and
fighting bodies), game roles are often [assigned on national and
territorial bases,]{.mark} and in full resemblance of international
alliances and cooperation. Yet history abounds with cases in which a
state, often using cyber-mercenaries, would anonymously attack an ally,
exactly because remoteness would allow this 'misbehaviour'.]{.underline}

[Framing [game scenarios]{.mark} as battles [between opposed national
formations]{.mark} thus also appears to [oversimplify the question of
agency (and state attribution) with regards to cyberattacks]{.mark} and
the inherent remoteness of these attacks]{.underline}. In 2010 Stuxnet,
a malicious computer worm, penetrated Iranian nuclear facilities and
successfully com- promised their industrial computer control systems.
Widely considered to be one of the most effective cyberattacks to date,
it still lacks clear state attribution (albeit with evidence pointing
strongly to an Israeli and US partnership behind the attack), and thus
legal grounds for prosecution (Lindsay, 2012). This incident shows
that[, [in the context of cyberwar, remoteness does not only constitute
an epistemological limit]{.mark} for framing and abstracting elements
for simulations, [but]{.mark} also [a precondition for
action]{.mark}]{.underline}. In other words, [[cyberwar would not exist
without its remoteness]{.underline}.]{.mark} In line with this argument,
many indeed praise cyberwar for allowing oper- ations that, albeit
non-violent, function in the prevention and deterrence of war (Lucas,
2012). According to this view, the launch of Stuxnet could be considered
as a non-violent alternative to a possible military intervention, and as
an effective measure in undermining, or at least setting back, a
perceived threat from the Iranian nuclear program (Lindsay, 2012). In
reality, [[this inherent remoteness dilutes sovereignty]{.mark}:
cyber-armies and groups are characterized by fluid membership and their
relation to national armies, and to states in general, often remains
untrace- able or unclear.]{.underline} At the same time, [lone-wolf
hackers, hacktivists or cyber- mercenaries usually tend to be co-opted
in larger operations, or act on their own terms while not being
physically present to one another or connected to an organiz- ation with
sovereign attributes.]{.underline}

[As cyberwar games become large-scale simulations involving remote and
simultaneous operations across countries, newer scenarios open up for
variables and tasks that, while not necessarily part of
cyber-confrontation per se, are designed to foster homogeneity in
cooperation and intervention amongst participants]{.underline}. In a
context that does not possess a uniformed modus operandi, parameters and
inputs are designed in ways that promote a common operational culture.
In this light, for instance, CG 2016 strongly focused on the
standardization of communication protocols between US forces and the
British Army. Similarly, the 700-plus par- ticipants of LS 2016 were
trained in writing human-readable reports in ways that not only security
experts but also policy makers could decipher and act upon. At the same
time, while the focus on communication aims to strengthen teams'
internal flows of information (for more effective operational
coordination and chain of command), the focus on media also seemed to
pertain to its political relevance. In fact, in the spirit of creating a
realistic scenario of cyberwar, fictional media workers were also
included in the game. Game planners framed media as a disturbance
variable, thus adding to the gameplay a requirement for participants to
engage with these media professionals on issues of information
disclosure and con- fidentiality (CCDCOE, 2016). Opening up the war game
scenario to elements that transcend conflictual interactions appears to
be consistent with the ambition of simulating cyberwar in more
comprehensive ways, thus reducing the gap between copy and original.
This also entails fostering partnership with private and commercial
sectors, as networks of interconnectedness require defence readiness at
the extremes and in all the ramifications of the network itself. For
this reason, [major non-state actors are increasingly involved into
cyberwar simulations and even design their own cyberwar
games]{.underline} -- such as the Bank of England's Operation Waking
Shark. [While the scenario's overall narrative differs substantially
from national security exercises, with a focus on criminal and
information theft rather than national security, operational exercises
and the overall language used in the scenario appear to
correspond.]{.underline}

[Analysing these games by reflecting on how [traditional aspects of war
come to be symbolized in the gameplay --- physical violence, state
sovereignty, territory, and ethics]{.mark} -- indicates that simulated
operational elements maintain a strong resemblance to reality; they are,
in Baudrillard's terms, simulations.]{.underline} On the other hand, the
fic- tional inaccuracy of contextual political and social aspects ---
the game scenario --- depicts games that have lost (each to a different
degree) a linear connection with the reality of cyberwar: [they [have
become simulacra]{.mark}.]{.underline} Clearly, the game scen- ario,
albeit strongly fictional, nevertheless maintains a strong connection to
the oper- ational aspects of the game. [[As simulations and simulacra
intersect, feeding each other in a circular fashion, they indicate that
cyberwar games ultimately represent a perversion of
reality]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### Attending to the uniqueness of cyberwar disrupts the status quo framing of traditional war as [normal]{.underline}. Our plan's focus solves peripheral violence.

Conclusion: cyberwar and the perversion of reality

[The existing [discrepancies between]{.mark} the framing of [traditional
warfare, the]{.mark} actual [phenomenology of cyberwar, and its
simulations]{.mark}/simulacra,]{.underline} do not only pertain to the
difficulties of abstracting a complex and remote social phenomenon into
a close-to-reality game. Rather, and in line with Baudrillard's
theorizing, they also [[raise questions as to how the culture of war
becomes stabilized]{.mark} in our society, and in the cultural artefacts
that are produced in its resemblance. Just as [actual war has undergone
a process of enhanced remoteness through technologies that detach
confrontation from actual physical experience]{.mark} (drones and the
like), virtualizations --- either [simulations]{.mark} or ontological
reproductions --- of the conflict [have come closer to the actuality of
war]{.mark}]{.underline}, or at times have even merged. More
specifically, as argued by Baudrillard (1995: 27) in his provocative The
Gulf War Did Not Take Place, '[we are no longer in a logic of the
passage from virtual to actual but in a hyper- realist logic of the
deterrence of the real by the virtual'.]{.underline}

[Existing interdisciplinary [scholarship and legislative
frameworks]{.mark}]{.underline}, in fact, draw extensively upon
classical categories of war to rethink how cyberwar could exist and
could be countered, and its simulated versions reproduce these same
categories in their designed scenarios. As this framing
[[confine]{.mark}s [cyberwar within the boundaries of traditional
warfare]{.mark}, classical elements are abstracted into roles and
interactions that are reproductive of those of traditional
wars.]{.underline} In these terms, [simulated scenarios generally frame
cyberwar in relation to the national security of states, their
sovereignty, defence and territorial boundaries. [This understanding of
cyberwar does not only reproduce defence and deterrence]{.mark}
according to an idea of cyberwar that pre-exists, [but also hardens
categories that appear]{.mark} in reality [to be]{.mark} manifest in
much more [fluid]{.mark} ways.]{.underline}

[Cyberattacks are not easy to equate with physical and violent force.
Infecting a computer system, impairing military networks, or taking a
website down, are hardly comparable to an actual airstrike or targeted
killing.]{.underline} Besides debating whether a website or online
content possess physical existence, however, [political violence done
upon these interrogates]{.underline}, after all[, how we are to
understand bodies and their agency]{.underline} (Cristiano, 2018),
[their interaction with machines]{.underline} (Clark, 2004; Clark 2016)
[and suffering in virtual domains]{.underline} (cfr. Massumi, 2010).
Moreover, in a context where perpetrators aim for off-line secrecy about
their identity, and humans are increasingly replaced by machines in the
conduct of cyberattacks, [state sovereignty and attribution do not only
come into the picture as devices of defence and deterrence, but also as
unattainable social constructs within virtuality]{.underline}. In these
terms, [a [prescriptive equation between cyber]{.mark}warfare [and
conventional war]{.mark}fare [appears not to fit]{.mark} if we analyse
how cyberwar is constructed in major simulations.]{.underline}

[Although different existing legal, defence and security categorizations
of cyberattacks and cyberwar can be theorized and simulated]{.underline}
in war games, they are nevertheless built around a framing that
recognizes the virtual and real as two mutually exclusionary dimensions
of being. In one of the few existing works on this issue in the context
of warfare, Dipert (2010) defines **[the ontological status of
cyberspace]{.underline}** as unique. This uniqueness **[depends on its
being both actual and virtual. It possesses characteristics that are
inherently physical: coaxial cables, fibre-optic lines, compu- ters,
servers etc. make up for its physical extension.]{.underline}** This
would imply that, for instance, websites and their contents should also
be considered as holding qualities that are actual, tangible. **[On the
other hand, cyberspace lacks a well-defined physical location,
geographical boundaries, concrete limits to personal property or a
defin- able state territory. A]{.underline}**nd in fact, it also
contains all those experiences --- such as war --- that remain
exclusively confined within the virtual with no necessary expansion into
the actual world. In this sense, [becoming real does not depend on
eventual emergence from remoteness but, rather, it exists within, and as
a product of, this very remoteness.]{.underline}

While of course existing in relation to actual conflicts and
international politics, [[cyberwar possesses its own]{.mark} cultures,
aesthetics and [dynamics of subjectification that shape its
nature]{.mark} beyond physicality and [through performative]{.mark}
moments that are often [confined to virtual settings]{.mark}, and thus
hardly replicable.]{.underline} On the other hand, the replicability of
operational aspects of cyberwar as linear simulations contradicts the
static and unproblematized setting of political scenarios that,

## Cold War Emerging Tech 1NC

#### **Cold War framing of emerging technology simulates a bygone, bipolar era of stability to conceal the indeterminacy of the postmodern condition. This seduces individuals to a mode of informatic governance and to technological theater which allows nation states to pretend they are solving an issue without actually doing anything. It also justifies populist and nationalist modes of violence as a corrective to the indeterminacy of meaning. Thinking through our postmodern condition is a prerequisite to effective policy making.**

It is hot to talk about a new Cold War, especially if you put cyber in
front of it. **[The new cyber Cold War concept is prominent in
discussions about geopolitics and Great Power
competition]{.underline}**1. Some2 have argued that the **[[Cold War
discourse frames competition and technological rivalry
between]{.mark}]{.underline}** states, mainly **[[the
US]{.mark}]{.underline}** and **[[China and]{.underline}]{.mark}** the
US and **[[Russia]{.mark}, in a way that fails to reflect the
complexities of current conflicts and dynamics of the original Cold
War]{.underline}**. **[This discours]{.underline}**e comes through in
policy and strategies, especially when referring to the governance of
cyber and emerging technologies. This **[raises questions
about]{.underline}** the security community itself and **[the
perceptions of policy and decision- makers]{.underline}** in this field.
Mainly, **[what exactly is so alluring about the Cold War that the
security community keeps coming back to it as a way to understand the
current state of conflict in the world?]{.underline}** More so, why is
it applied to cyber, including cyber operations, cyber-related
technologies, cyberspace, etc., with such conviction? This paper frames
the emphasis on a new Cold War as a hyperreality that is heavily focused
on technologies and the perceptions of their alleged uses in future
conflicts. By drawing on the works of Baudrillard and others, this paper
argues that **[[the current focus on Cold War discourse to frame the
security environment, and especially cyber, is based on a comfortable
imaginary reality that is knowable, ordered, and familiar]{.mark}. Yet,
[this reality is a simulation that is repeated again and again and
perpetuated by a focus on emerging technologies in the discourse as
embedded with geopolitics.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

This paper aims to present a complex exploration into the postmodern
framings of defence and security policy. This paper is structured as
such: first, the rationale of this paper is presented, emphasizing its
importance for policy and decision-makers and members of the security
community. After this, the 'postmodern condition' is described as it
relates to increasing uncertainty and disorder about the state of the
world (via Bauman). This uncertain condition is then linked to a
discussion about simulations of reality and hyperreality tied in with
emerging technologies. Following this, the seductions of free-market
capitalism are brought into discussion with the meaning-making discourse
that mirrors the dichotomies of the Cold War. This serves to articulate
further the linkages between seductions, capitalism, and the
fetishization of technologies. Baudrillard's (in)famous arguments in The
Gulf War Did Not Take Place (1995), and The Spirit of Terrorism and
Requiem for the Twin Towers (2002) are used to show how hyperrealities
become embedded in the discourse of the security community, especially
through a focus on emerging technologies. Baudrillard's arguments lead
to a discussion highlighting how this perception fetishizes technologies
and is perpetuated by myths based on capitalist and consumerist intents.
The last section discusses the current understanding of emerging
technologies and cyber in Canada from a military perspective in policy
language in Strong, Secure, Engaged: Canada's Defence Policy (2017)
(SSE). The paper concludes with a 'translation' of the discussion by
describing three tangible considerations for policy and decision-makers.

**IMPORTANCE OF METAPHORS AND ANALOGIES**

**[[A postmodern deep dive]{.mark} into cyber and emerging technologies
might seem beyond the scope of a policy audience]{.underline}**. Perhaps
it may seem too complex and abstract for consideration in decision-
making. **[However, it [is not]{.mark} as abstract or [removed from
policy and decision-making]{.mark} as one would assume.]{.underline}**
This is because **[[discourse can shape]{.mark} organization, practices,
methods, and strategy, or the 'reality' of
[policymaking]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

The **[discourse about cyber, including threats, security, and space,
shapes and is shaped by the definition of 'reality'.]{.underline}** Dunn
Cavelty (2013) shows that various actors, including state and non-state
actors, seek to assert themselves within this definition process. Part
of this process involves the use of metaphors and analogies.
**[Metaphors shape 'reality', what is 'known', or imagined, about
cyber.]{.underline}** For example, **[[imagining cyberspace as a
'frontier' associates the concepts of unruliness and lawlessness with
the need for order]{.mark} within this domain]{.underline}** (Dunn
Cavelty 2013). Sulek and Moran (2009) show how **[analogies, such as a
Cyber Pearl Harbour, cyber Cold War, and cyber 9/11, etc., can inform
future cyber strategies.]{.underline}** In their analysis of **[[the
cyber Cold War analogy]{.underline}]{.mark}**, Sulek and Moran (2009)
show that it **[[is "primarily anchored in the idea that powerful
nation-states are competing for influence and power without resorting to
a direct conventional or nuclear war"]{.mark} (]{.underline}**8).
Nevertheless, their comparison of the similarities and differences
between the 'actual' Cold War and a cyber Cold War does not adequately
explore the underlying fixations, spectacle, and seductions of this
period and how this shapes decision-making and strategy. What is needed
is a more nuanced understanding of why this analogy exists, its context,
and what it says about the security community's goals, fears, and
choices.

Although the threat environment has changed since the **[[Cold War,
narratives]{.underline}]{.mark}** drawing on this period **[still
[permeate policy and influence decision-making]{.mark}. These narratives
[frequently imply a level of certainty, calculability, and]{.mark}
relative [stability]{.mark} of an apparently bipolar
world]{.underline}**. **[[The intricacies]{.mark} [of current conflicts
and threats require a]{.mark}]{.underline}** more nuanced understanding,
and **[[a postmodern approach]{.underline}]{.mark}** may help the
security community better understand these complexities (Dunn Cavelty
and Mauer 2009). **[This means understanding and facing the 'new'
'cyber' Cold War discourse and its impact on cyber and defence strategy
for policy and decision-makers]{.underline}**. This process starts by
delving into the postmodern condition and the search for meaning and
stability.

**THE POSTMODERN CONDITION**

Modernity is characterized as a search for meaning, order, and
stability. Prior to the influence of globalization and neoliberalism,
this search was usually answered in the West by the state, church, and/
or family, whereby citizens found stability and identity. Large-scale
globalization and neoliberalism starting in the 1990s opened up the
world to the possibility of choice. It presented individuals with the
freedom to make meaning through their own choices. The corresponding
retreat of the state gave individuals a diversity of options to find
meaning, yet this freedom resulted in instability. According to Bauman
(1997), this **[[instability results from a sense of insecurity,
uncertainty, and the constant search for meaning outside of the
traditional channels]{.mark}. This is the postmodern condition,
specifically the power of other actors outside and including the state,
to control individuals' options for choice.]{.underline}** As a result,
**[[individuals are without traditional criteria for]{.mark} ascribing
[identity]{.mark} or achieving meaning in life.]{.underline}**

**[Thus, [they search elsewhere for meaning]{.mark}]{.underline}** and
new lifestyles. **[These identity-making and consumer- oriented options
are coloured with capitalism and aim to 'seduce' individuals into
consumerism to ease the overwhelming sense of uncertainty. This
uncertainty is fuelled by capitalistic dreams that can promise meaning
and fulfillment.]{.underline}**

In Liquid Life, Bauman (2005) characterizes postmodern life as a
constant struggle of reinvention and a search for meaning. This search
for meaning and purpose can be applied to any part of society whereby
the state's traditional role is in flux and new possibilities are
sought. Globalization has changed the interactions and organization
between people, and as a result, changed the constructs that
traditionally bind people to a state. **[The subsequent uncertainty, or
liquidity of meaning and belonging in the modern world, has led to many
responses by diverse actors outside of the traditional state-focused
approach.]{.underline}** Responses to this liquidity must mould tangible
meaning for individuals to choose; it must also provide **[[structure,
identity, meaning]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and **[[can be flavoured with
capitalism, or]{.underline}]{.mark}** as argued elsewhere (see Csenkey
2018), **[[populism and nationalism. States]{.mark} can [use
these]{.mark} flavours [to bolster state-serving
practises]{.mark},]{.underline}** for example, **[by [structuring fear
of the 'Other' in]{.mark} border security and national [security
policies]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Csenkey 2018; 2020; Bauman 2006). For
Bauman, individuals are left with no strings to grasp from the past as
they buy into these new capitalist dreams.

Unlike Bauman (2005), Baudrillard (1994) does not see globalization and
neoliberalism as the end of history (Fukuyama 1992) or identity. New
meanings and lifestyles are not necessarily new --- they can be
rebranded and sold in new ways with mixed flavours --- the 'old wine,
new bottles' approach. For Baudrillard, the postmodern condition
includes all ideas from the past. These ideas, however, are now
negotiable and are included in the mix of histories and simulations to
be seduced by.

**[The postmodern condition is essential to understand because it is
tied inextricably with the simulations that make postmodern life a
reality. Uncertainty about order, meaning, and the search for identity
and stability in a globalized world can be rebranded and sold as
answers. These answers can be crafted as realities]{.underline}**
(vis-a-vis Baudrillard). However, as we shall see, these realities are
simulations, and simulations of simulations, and simulations of the
real.

**SIMULATIONS OF THE REAL**

Simulations are reality without reality. The postmodern condition is
characterized by simulations and hyperrealities (recall Baudrillard).
These simulations and hyperrealities guide perceptions of reality,
including choices, identities, and governance practices.

Using Baudrillard's (1983) example, imagine the creation of a map. The
mapping of a territory, including drawing its borders, natural features,
and parcelling out associated sovereignty claims, is based on a reality.
This reality is based on geography, history, and the real world --- yet
it is only a simulation of the real. **[When the reality that the
simulation is based on is removed, all following reproductions are based
on the simulation itself. What is left is a 'hyperreality' or a
simulacrum]{.underline}**. Baudrillard describes this as **[a model of a
real without the original reality.]{.underline}** For Baudrillard:

"\[t\]he real is produced from miniaturized units, from matrices, memory
banks and command models - and with these, it can be reproduced an
indefinite number of times. It no longer has to be rational since it is
no longer measured against some ideal or negative instance. It is
nothing more than operational. In fact, since it is no longer enveloped
by an imaginary, it is no longer real at all. It is hyperreal: the
product of an irradiating synthesis of combinatory models in a
hyperspace without atmosphere." (1983: 3).

**[Hyperrealities are not duplicates or imitations of reality, nor are
they representations.]{.underline}** Representations assume that the
sign and the real are equivalent. **[Simulacrum, or hyperrealities, are
simulations of reality, reflections that mask or in some way pervert
reality.]{.underline}** It masks it in such a way that it does not look
like reality anymore and bears no relation. **[Cyber is a hyperreality
--- it is a simulation of the real.]{.underline}**

**Inscribing Reality, or how to Govern Technologies**

Cyber is a hyperreal space; it has intangible and tangible pieces, is
interacted by diverse users, technologies, and operates in different
contexts. **[From a military perspective, this is problematic. [The
liquidity of the postmodern condition affects military frameworks
because it creates uncertainty about structure, order, and
rationale.]{.mark}]{.underline}** This is further complicated by **[[the
plethora of actors,]{.underline}]{.mark}** including new adversaries and
their **[[motives and strategies]{.underline}]{.mark}**, operating in
this space. Additionally, **[[new technologies]{.mark},]{.underline}**
especially those outside of a defence context, are challenging to
govern. In combination, all of these factors **[[result in
instability]{.mark}.]{.underline}** One such way is to stabilize the
unstable, solidify the liquid uncertainty, and define reality through
inscription.

The complexity and uncertainty associated with cyber and emerging
technologies operating in this space can be made tangible, and therefore
governable through inscription. For Latour (1987), part of this process
is through inscription devices. Reality is made stable through the
inscription of meaning onto things and concepts. **[[When reality is
made stable, it]{.mark} is comparable, combinable; it [can be debated,
calculated, and diagnosed]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Part of **[this
inscription process involves making and using
information.]{.underline}** In Seeing Like a State, Scott (1998) argues
that [**[states craft ways to imagine the world as easier to
govern]{.underline}**.]{.mark} States do this **[[by making people,
processes, things, regions, etc. quantifiable]{.mark}, or easier to
govern through current systems.]{.underline}** For example, assigning a
person a SIN or giving areas of land postal codes. This, in turn,
modifies the perception of these 'things' and feeds into the design,
enforcement, and retention of governance through a specific lens. These
are inscription devices enabling information to be created about
concepts and things. **[This information is used and funnelled through
'centres of calculation' whereby it is understood in relation to other
information]{.underline}** (Latour 1987). **[In these centres of
calculation, the information is manipulated for use]{.underline}**,
including understanding its effects on other information.

Inscriptions accumulate, and this makes them powerful. The more
information is gathered, manipulated, computed, and used via centers of
calculation, the more legitimate they become. This information is
transformed into plans and strategies, whereby legitimacy, and therefore
power, is ascribed to those who seek to govern. **[When cyber-related
emerging technologies are inscribed with a reality through information
about them from a specific context, it makes them
governable]{.underline}**. This paper focuses on understanding the
realities cyber technologies are inscribed with and how and why they
seduce the security community.

**SEDUCTION: MARKETING IDENTITY AND MEANING**

Although 'free' to choose meaning and lifestyles, there is a perpetual
uncertainty about the world (Bauman 1997; 2005). Some of this
uncertainty is nested in technologies, their uses, users, capabilities,
contexts, etc. Globalization saw a decline in metanarratives and grand
theories, especially those held and perpetuated by traditional actors
like the state. Technologies can be seen as part of a regime of
globalization. **[Although there is anxiety about technologies, the
[associated narratives provide some]{.mark} recentering and [restoration
of meaning]{.mark} and choice]{.underline}**. For Baudrillard, **[this
is]{.underline}** power which he calls **[seduction,]{.underline}** and
**[it resides in the representation of the visible and invisible and
making it consumable. Society is organized around the logic of
consumption. Consumerism has brought some certainty and stability to the
liquid uncertainty of the globalized world. [One of the comforting
aspects of consumerism is that it is limitless]{.mark}]{.underline}**
(Baudrillard 1998 \[1970\]). This means that there are never-ending
promises and pleasures**[. Society's appetites will constantly grow and
seek new products as a consuming community]{.underline}**. In other
words, it is a society driven by consumerism (Bauman 1992) and a
postmodern world of simulations and hyperrealities (vis-a-vis
Baudrillard). The key to fulfilling and perpetuating these endless
consumeristic needs is through seduction, primarily through the
production of imagery and information.

According to Baudrillard (1990 \[1979\]), seduction is "the strategy of
appearance" (7, 8), including over imagery. Seduction supposes an order
of things based on something beyond reality, although it appears to
offer it. **[[The seduction of]{.mark} a reality that offers stability,
including familiar imagery, meaning, and aesthetics, drives the desire
to 'buy-in'.]{.underline}** The seduction of meaning through imagery was
on display in a newly 'experienced' way during the technology theatre of
the Gulf War.

**THE TECHNOLOGY THEATRE OF THE GULF WAR**

**[The Gulf War could be seen as a high-tech war, [a 'clean' war ---
where technologies]{.mark} were used to [engage in an efficient]{.mark}
and modern [conflict whereby the state with the most advanced
technologies would win and suffer less]{.mark}
casualties.]{.underline}** This would act as a deterrent to other
adversaries to engage in future conflicts. **[This high-tech [war was
seen and 'experienced' through new media,]{.mark} with new visuals and
aesthetics. 'Real'-time footage from US bombers in the air and from
cameras on the ground allowed the 'audience' to 'see' the action.
Nevertheless, this vision of a 'virtual,' high precision war was not
real.]{.underline}** Baudrillard argues in his 1995 piece, The Gulf War
Did Not Take Place, that what **[the 'audience' or viewers saw through
the media in 1990 -1991 was not the reality of the Gulf War. What was
seen was]{.underline}**, in fact, **[a simulation of a real war on
television]{.underline}**. What was seen and heard did not happen ---
that war was not real and did not occur. Baudrillard (1992) argues that
**[the media provides a simulation because it is an imperfect
representation of what happens in the world and the representations of
the real world.]{.underline}**

**[[From this simulation of high-tech war, a new hyperreality was
created]{.mark} --- one that looks like the simulated reality without
the original.]{.underline}** This has altered the perception not only of
what happened during the Gulf War but following conflicts. **[At the
heart of this hyperreality is a fixation with technology. [This fixation
plays out as a 'technology theatre.]{.mark}']{.underline}**

Technology theatre builds off Schneier's (2003) original understanding
of the 'security theatre.' Simply, the security theatre is doing
'things' to make reality feel secure without actually addressing the
causes of insecurity or threats. Heightened airport security
infrastructures after 9/11 are an often- cited example of the security
theatre. The **[technology theatre]{.underline}** is similar because it
also **[attempts to build a sense of security through interventions that
appear to solve a problem]{.underline}**. McDonald (2020) defines
technology theatre as "**[[the use of technology interventions that make
people feel as if a government]{.underline}]{.mark}** --- and, more
often, a specific group of political leaders --- **[[is solving a
problem, without it doing anything]{.underline}]{.mark}** to actually
solve that problem." For McDonald, **[the [technology theatre is a
distraction, a political tactic used to make governments appear to be
making progress]{.mark} in solving an issue]{.underline}**. For example,
this issue could be attempting to address the outbreak of COVID-19
through contact tracing applications. This paper sees the technology
theatre a bit differently. Instead of a largely political tool, **[the
technology theatre within the context of military operations is where
the hyperreality of war takes stage, with high-tech weapons on show in a
way that further reinforces the simulated reality of conflict. Both the
technology and the security theatres build on the visible aspect of
doing 'things' to address problems --- even if these 'things' are
performative instead of constructive.]{.underline}**

**The Spectacle of the Hyperreal**

Unlike Baudrillard's controversial statements in The Gulf War (1995), in
The Spirit of Terrorism and Requiem for the Twin Towers (2002),
Baudrillard argues that 9/11 did happen. Yet, he argues that there were
intangible unrealities that collapsed into each other as 9/11 became an
exchange of symbolic violence presented through the media (ibid. 2002).
This was different from what was 'seen' during the Gulf War. The
terrorist attacks in 2001 on the World Trade Center destroyed the
physical structures and the symbolic object. This occurred as a
'spectacle,' a 'fascination' with the image and its symbolism. More
specifically, "\[t\]he image consumes the event, in the sense that it
absorbs it and offers it for consumption" (Baudrillard 2002: 21). This
is different from McLuhan's (1964) idea that 'the medium is the
message.' **[Hyperreality does not distinguish between the medium or the
message --- the two can no longer be determined as distinct --- they
collapse into each other]{.underline}** (Baudrillard 1994**[).
Technologies and their content are not reality. Hyperreality, simulated
imagery, and inscribed technologies and information are part of the
technology theatre and are created by spectacles to be seduced
by.]{.underline}**

For Baudrillard, the Gulf War was a drama of a war whereby Western power
and ideas of modernity, democracy, and order were fully displayed. This
theatre performance was a hyperreality because the war appeared orderly,
precise, 'consensual,' and certain. The viewers at home could
'experience' the visuals and an impression of war without the original
at their leisure. The Gulf War was an "\...unreal war in which the
over-dimensioned technical power, in turn, over-evaluates the real
forces of an enemy which it cannot see" (Baudrillard 1995: 80). **[The
current perceptions of war were shaped by this simulation and are now
hyperrealities. [The consumer viewers' experience of war is mundane and
tied with leisure and the expectation that high tech will win
wars]{.mark}. The consumer has many options to experience this
hyperreality, including imagery and aesthetics imbued with
meaning.]{.underline}**

**[The [technologies within this theatre were inscribed with information
and meaning that feeds into and reinforces the performance]{.mark}
itself.]{.underline}** These inscription devices (recall Latour 1987)
are then reinforced by hyperrealities seen in visuals on television and
in 'real' time and played a role in the confusion of the real and the
hyperreal, including a fetishization of technologies.

**FETISHIZING TECHNOLOGIES: THE PLEASURES OF THE REAL MYTHS**

In this context of this discussion, a fetish is a consumer object. It is
something to be seduced by through consumption (Baudrillard 1998
\[1970\]). As previously discussed, consumerism is intertwined with the
postmodern condition and hyperreality. **[Technologies can be fetishized
and turned into objects of desire and fantasy-building.]{.underline}**
As argued by Baudrillard (1995), **[this was seen during the Gulf War,
where an emphasis on technologies as winning hyperreal wars is pivotal
to how we perceive the future of conflict. [The technology theatre
places technologies at the center of the stage to perform military
solutions to problems.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Circling back to the focus of this paper, what is to be done about
simulations, hyperrealities, theatres, and fetishisms? Why does the
security community fixate on Cold War discourse, fetishize technologies,
and become seduced by the hyperreality of a cyber Cold War? Ang's (1989)
work on melodramatic imaginations brings us towards some possible
answers. Drawing on Ang (1989; 1996), 'real' 'pleasures' can be
fulfilled by fantasies or myths. These are realities in themselves,
albeit hyperrealities, and this is a place to look for some insight into
the fixation with the new Cold War discourse.

Pleasures are not satisfactions; they are instead longing for a past
that can include a perceived future. This future can also be a perceived
past --- or a hyperreality --- it can be a present, but in all cases, it
is connected to the fiction of positions, solutions, feelings, and
structures (Ang 1989). In other words, **[there is pleasure in fictional
representations of reality or the melodramatic imagination. Identity and
meaning within these imaginations are fluid and are given meaning when
performed.]{.underline}** Recalling Butler's (1990) arguments about the
performativity and fluidity of gender, these identity performances occur
within specific contexts. To situate this argument in this paper:
**[technology theatres are where and how identities are performed, and
this gives and reinforces its meaning. [These performances and
melodramatic imaginations are nested in nostalgia for the Cold War
era]{.mark}]{.underline}**, or more specifically, **[[the order,
meaning, and identity]{.mark} ascribed within the binary [of bipolarity.
This is]{.mark} the pleasure of the techno-fetish.]{.underline}**

**[The nostalgia for the Cold War aesthetics as a melodramatic
imagination of the security community is [a search for meaning and order
in a cyber hyperreality where everything seems uncertain and
disordered.]{.mark} This includes the technologies, capabilities,
adversaries, strategies, operations, and the changing nature of war
itself. Nostalgia, myths, and simulations go hand-in-
hand]{.underline}** in this case:

"When the real is no longer what it used to be, nostalgia assumes its
full meaning. There is a proliferation of myths of origin and signs of
reality; of second-hand truth, objectivity and authenticity. There is an
escalation of the true, of the lived experience; a resurrection of the
figurative where the object and substance have disappeared. And there is
a panic-stricken production of the real and the referential, above and
parallel to the panic of material production. This is how simulation
appears in the phase that concerns us: a strategy of the real, neo-real
and hyperreal, whose universal double is a strategy of deterrence."
(Baudrillard 1983: 12).

Drawing on Mosco's (2005) description of the Digital Sublime, to
contextualize myths about technologies, myths "offer entrance to another
reality, a reality\... characterized by the promise of the sublime" (3).
The sublime and sublime icons are sources of "utopian visions" (ibid: 6)
"mutually constituted \...out of the interconnected realities\...."
(ibid: 10). Myths are not just distortions of reality --- they are a
form of reality and give meaning to the incomprehensible, allow us to
cope with overwhelming problems, and create comfortable and consensual
visions.

Myths are central to understanding cyber hyperrealities and new Cold War
discourse. Examining myths about technologies reveals the desires and
the hidden configurations of power nested in neoliberal practises. Myths
are enacted and continually contribute to constructing mythic 'things,'
theatres, and performances. In the next section, we apply theory to
practice.

**COLD WAR MYTHS TODAY**

**[The Cold War is over, yet the discourse on "Great Power" politics may
say otherwise. This is especially prevalent in popular discussions about
cyber and cyber-related emerging technologies and the future of
conflict. The uncertainty of modernity and the postmodern condition is
felt within the security community. The myths surrounding emerging
technologies guide the community to believe that we are indeed
experiencing a new Cold War. This is a melodramatic imagination to find
pleasure and comfort in the knowable and a past real (or a perception of
a past), where technologies were seen as tangible, and the wars'
happened.' These pasts and futures are ideas and aesthetics for
sale.]{.underline}** Myths are seductive, and "\[i\]n the real world,
the development and deployment of technologies have generated their own
mythic structures, borrowing from much older ideas and bringing these
together with new ideas have produced myths repacked for our time"
(Burnett et al. 2009: 1-2). Myths support and sustain consumerism,
creating identity, structures, institutions, and a complex interplay of
understandings. This is important to understand because it shapes
everyday lives, lived experiences, uses of technologies, and shapes
world views and power relations.

In defence policy, these myths and pleasurable hyperrealities are
reinforced. In SSE, for example, new Cold War nostalgia is visible and
mixed with the hyperreality of cyber:

"The re-emergence of major power competition has reminded Canada and its
allies of the importance of deterrence. At its core, deterrence is about
discouraging a potential adversary from doing something harmful before
they do it\... Deterrence has traditionally focused on conventional and
nuclear capabilities, but the concept is also increasingly relevant to
the space and cyber domains." (emphasis added, DND 2017: 50).

**[[Discussions about major power competition, deterrence, and
geopolitical technology races are new Cold War
discourse]{.mark}.]{.underline}** SSE describes the changing nature of
warfare due to the proliferation of weapons, hybrid tactics, terrorism,
among other factors. In the subsection, "The Re-Emergence of
Deterrence," the changing global security environment is described as a
"return of major power rivalry, new threats from non-state actors, and
challenges in the space and cyber domains have returned deterrence to
the centre of defence thinking" (emphasis added, DND 2017: 55).

Linking these concepts back to Baudrillard's arguments in The Gulf War
(1995), **[[war is a technology theatre whereby the heavy use and the
public display of high-tech weaponry in a conflict fetishize
technologies]{.mark}.]{.underline}** For Baudrillard (1995), the Gulf
War legitimized the logic of deterrence. **[One of the problems with
deterrence is that it assumes that everyone is on the same strategy page
with equal access to technology and weaponry. It assumes that there is a
result of escalation and is seeded in assumptions about deterrence
itself.]{.underline}** For Baudrillard (1995), the Cold War was based on
**[[the realist logic of deterrence]{.mark}.]{.underline}** This **[[has
become a hyperrealist logic of deterrence whereby the real is deterred
by the virtual]{.mark}. [This]{.mark} logic has [fundamentally changed
war]{.mark} --- it has made war abstract, beyond the imaginary, so that
[it becomes an unreality]{.mark} that is the reality.]{.underline}**

**[[Uncertainty about the future is perceived as uncertainty about
tech]{.mark}nological capabilities and their alignment with current
understanding and conflict strategies]{.underline}**. SSE states:

"Technological developments point to a future of defence that is
expected to be vastly different than today, with a greater emphasis on
information technologies, data analytics, deep learning, autonomous
systems, advancements in the electromagnetic and cyber domains, as well
as a range of transformative technologies, from quantum computing to
synthetic biology. Any number of these advances has the potential to
change the fundamental nature of military operations." (55).

According to Baudrillard, **[the technology theatre and the conflict
that followed the Gulf War are not about politics.]{.underline}**
Specifically, they are not the virtual version of the Clausewitzian
concept of the 'absence of war by other means.[' **[Cyber
conflicts]{.underline}**]{.mark}, or as Baudrillard refers to them as
'electronic wars'**[, do not have political objectives]{.underline}**
because:

"**[It [function]{.mark}s [as a preventative electroshock against any
future conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Just as in modern communication,
there is no longer any interlocutor, **[so [in this electronic war there
is no longer any enemy, there is only a refractory element which must be
neutralized and consensual]{.mark}]{.underline}**." (1995: 84).

In crafting policies to understand and strategize the future of
conflict, it is crucial to recognize the role that information plays in
inscription devices and the centres of calculation (Latour 1987). The
manipulation and use of information about technologies ascribes
legitimacy.

**CONCLUDING REMARKS: TRANSLATION, PLEASE**

To summarize the theoretical portion of this paper: the Cold War was a
perfectly conformable simulated reality to build into a simulacrum.
There was order in the Cold War: there was duality, dichotomies,
bipolarity. Yet, this was not the lived reality of the Cold War, but a
melodramatic imagination, where the imagery and perception of advanced
technologies are fetishized as the answer to solving conflicts.

This paper has engaged in a complicated discussion about how
technologies are framed within certain realities, used to craft
hyperrealities, and perpetuate mutually constructed myths about conflict
in the world. If the reader is skimming to the end of this paper to
arrive at the 'so-what' value, or to find some translation for this
postmodern-heavy content, then it is presented in this section. The
answer to the question: **[[what does this mean for
decision-makers?]{.underline}]{.mark}** is presented here as simply,
**[[proceed with caution]{.underline}]{.mark}** and do it in three ways:

1\) **[[Be critical of narratives laden with Cold War commentaries,
including Great Power rivalries, competition, and misguided dichotomies,
e]{.mark}specially when integrated into the cyber
environment.]{.underline}** Multiple actors exist and operate in the
world, each with different strategies, linkages, and goals. Competition
between actors may assume equal access to technology or similar
strategies, but it is not always the case.

2\) **[[Be wary of]{.mark} technological hype and [fixations on
technologies]{.mark} without understanding their capabilities in
multiple contexts and their ability to go between
applications.]{.underline}** Technologies can be sold for more than what
they are, and they may also assume compatible uses across multiple
contexts.

3\) **[[Uncertainty is ok.]{.mark} Facing disorder is challenging,
especially from a military standpoint, but [address]{.mark}ing
[uncertainty with flexible frameworks that do not]{.mark} seek to
[replicate an imaginary]{.mark} best practice that involves an adapted
model of [Cold War bipolarity.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

## Info Wars 1NC

#### The generative point of violence today is the attempt to reduce all geopolitical events to information. Three impacts: (i) the proliferation of information thickens the fog of war, making conflicts more likely; (ii) the pursuit of information at all costs enacts a will to transparency that wages a global war on all singularities; and (iii) the reduction of all events to units of information that can be circulated within a closed system of exchange exhausts the possibility of meaning and value.

Polytechnic, Francois, professor of political science at Virginia
Polytechnic, \"*The Digital Fog of War: Baudrillard and the Violence of
Representation*,\" Baudrillard Studies Vol. 11 No. 2\]

Such an expectation about the ontological "location" of the objects,
subjects, stakes, and processes of today's virulent war is generative of
another expectation: that of the so-called self-evident violence of war
and, by extension, of anything that socially and politically is said to
matter for and about the demos (since virulent/[[virtual war is an
**all-encompassing**]{.mark}, or **all-swarming**, "**[geopolitical
reality]{.mark}**").]{.underline} In other words, [what the so-called
**objects** and **subjects** of today's **virtual**/**virulent** **war**
expect "their" war to represent is what ensures [a **disposition**
**towards violence**]{.mark} (a **violence of "the
global,**"]{.underline} perhaps, as Baudrillard intimates) [[that
may]{.mark} well [be the result of attempts at securing a **will to
meaning**, a will to **make sense** of **things**,]{.mark} and a will to
be of **political objects** and **subjects** that today takes place or,
rather, is **intensified** in **virtual** and **digital modalities** of
**representation** and **mediation**.]{.underline} Part of the critical
stake of this essay is [[to "**locate**" the
violence]{.mark}/**virulence** [of **contemporary warfare** not just
in]{.mark} its empirical [**geopolitical "events,"** but]{.mark} rather
[in the **representational domain** inside which those]{.mark} so-called
[events are **expected** to **make sense**]{.mark}**,** that is to say,
[in the always already **preemptively belligerent** and **aggressive**
realm of **representation**]{.mark} (where the challenge is [to
**produce** and **impose** **meaning** at all
costs]{.mark}).]{.underline} II. The Fog of War [The claim about a
**certain quality** of **reality**]{.underline} or even realism to new
digital informational or communicative technologies [has played a
**formative role** in the global staging of several **recent social**
and **political conflicts**.]{.underline} In both the Arab Spring and
the Occupy movements of 2011, for example, digital technologies were
celebrated for their real-time capacity and their subversive
(democratic) potentials. The virtue of reporting "from the ground" of
the event itself was championed as a matter of authenticity. [There was
a common sense that "**truth**" would finally be able to speak from its
"**real" source** (the demos itself?). Not only is there a prevalent
uncritical (even if sometimes well-intentioned) **faith** in **new
media** and their **digital technologies** today, but, more importantly,
there is often an **impulse of** **liberation**. Yet, this impulse is
stifled by its **faith in representation**. [The hope for]{.mark}
**openness**, **[transparency]{.mark}**, **immediacy**, and indeed
**liberation** is so tethered to the **real** (and to the will to
reality) that it [ends up being]{.mark} **negative** or, at least,
**[self-defeating]{.mark}**.]{.underline} It often becomes evident that
the so-called democratic uses of new media technologies---particularly
in terms of reporting violent war events or conflicts of allegedly great
concern/importance to the global demos---are, [far from producing a
**clearer picture** of an objective event, [contributing to an ever
**thickening fog** of **meaning**]{.mark} and **truth**.]{.underline}
These new media technologies in and of themselves are not the object of
our critique here. Moreover, [we are not interested in "**clearing the
fog**" of the **real** or **war**. Again, our critical intervention in
this essay has more to do with deploying perspectives that may expose
the **violent dispositions** of the **contemporary mythos** of **war**
(and revealing the **complicit role** of the digitalized demos in the
**intensification** of this mythos) than with attempting to clear the
way for a different ethos about **everyday reality**, digitalized
**media**, and the **prevalence** of **warfare** in **political
representations**.]{.underline} In fact, part of our argument is also to
suggest that [[the various]{.mark} cultural, [political, and ethical
mechanisms that seek to **clear the fog** of the real (and war)]{.mark}
often [end up **reproducing it.**]{.mark} The lure to **criticize** and
**debunk reality** often requires that **another real**, another
**certainty**, another **dominant meaning**, or indeed another
democratic necessity be established through the same **means** and
**techniques**, and media, that had to be challenged in the first place
(thus, the simulacrum **continues to proliferate** its reality-effects).
**[Behind the widespread "global" celebration of digitalized
technologies for their newly found representational capabilities and
accuracies, there lies the idea that,]{.mark}**]{.underline} perhaps
following a collective disgust with the dealings of Western media
outlets as more or less uncritical props for the social/economic/ethical
status quo in the past several decades, **[[disseminated and
"democratized" media technologies can de-mystify the world,]{.mark}
l]{.underline}**ift its aura in a way, or perhaps "dig deeper" into the
"truth" than, say, what the media networks involved in reporting news
(including war news) in the 1980s and 1990's (the famous CNN effect)
ever could do. Because [these technologies are far more in real-time
than news networks, they are also generally thought to be able to evade
**oppressive**/**repressive** censorship of particular
corporate/class/state/ideology interests. But even more than escaping
filters, [**digital representations** today are often thought to be able
to **eliminate** all of the **ambiguities**]{.mark} born of time. Thus,
we (members of the public/demos) want to believe that **mediation** can
be **removed**. And [we want to subscribe to the view that any
**distortion** occurring between an event and its
perception/]{.mark}memory, or between the "**actual**" and its
**account**, [can **evaporate**.]{.mark} By reducing to the
**virtually** **infinitesimal** or invisible the filter/screen between
the **image** that represents and the real that is and, **furthermore**,
by placing the **productive responsibilities** for the image into the
hands of the **user** (literally into the digits), the digital
establishes itself as **something capable** of demolishing the
"**malicious**" surface of appearances to reveal a **meaningful**
**density** of **truth**]{.underline} through the quasi-immediate
interface. This is the dream of immediacy rediscovered and perhaps
finally realized. At a most basic level of analysis, the risk involved
in pointing to this desire for mediatized or digitalized immediacy would
be to undermine the visual evidence of the violent/virulent occurrence
of the omnipresence of war. For example, could we have deployed a
critique of the US military's and the US government's use of torture in
the War on Terror were it not for the seemingly unfiltered "shock and
awe" of the Abu Ghraib photos? Again, from the point of view of the
ethos of virtual/virulent war, the lure of digitalized immediacy has its
uses (and, possibly, benefits, too, even for the demos). But, from the
perspective of war's mythos, it must be said that [[the "**truth**"
about **war**]{.mark} and war operations [cannot be **fully revealed**
because **representation**]{.mark}, no matter how **immediate** or
seemingly **unmediated**, [always works by imposing some **meaning**
onto things]{.mark}/events that are made
**visible/representable**.]{.underline} Consider the role played by
digital media in the Boston Marathon bombing in April 2013. Within a
matter of minutes of the blasts, even [before the **smoke** could
**clear the scene**, images and videos of terror taken from
**spectators' mobile devices** circulated through **cyberspace**.
Everything was seemingly **captured** in that **instant.** The horror
that drew so many people to **capture images** through their smart
phones seems to **speak** on its **own**; it needs no **commentary**,
**no meaning** to be given to it. In fact, it appears to have no
**mediation**, no **appropriation** or **narrativizing**, no
**contextualizing** either.]{.underline} That is precisely why smart
phones are so apt at giving us such images, such representations, such
"pure" meanings about things. Especially, such a horrifying violence, it
is said, needs no commentary, no sense to be made of it. [An
[**immeasurable violence** is done to the violated when one tries to
**make sense** of the **senseless**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Agamben,
1999). Yet, as Baudrillard had already pointed out in his remarks on the
Gulf War, "[[everything]{.mark} which is [**turned into information**
becomes]{.mark} the **object** of **endless speculation,** [the site of
**total uncertainty**. We are left with the **symptomatic reading**
on]{.mark} our [screens]{.mark} of the effects of the war, or the
effects of **discourse** about the **war**, or completely **speculative
strategic evaluations**]{.underline}" (Baudrillard, 1995: 41). [In their
**digital representation**, images of [**war** and]{.mark} images of
[**terror**]{.mark} are [dissolve]{.mark}d [into]{.mark} their **own
[information]{.mark}**. Information (what the image/event wants to tell
us, to reveal, allegedly) already **infiltrates** the tweeted or texted
**image**/scene (of **horror**, of **war**) with an urgency of
**signification** and **meaning**.]{.underline} [Images of horror
**cannot make sense**, perhaps must not be made sense of, and yet they
somehow **beg for meaning**, for circulation, or for **propagation**, in
the hope that they may **reveal something** to **someone**.]{.underline}
Thus, the digitalized mediation of the image, even in its instantaneity,
still takes place. [Images---or whatever event might have been
"caught"---must succumb to a **will to information**, to a will to
**meaning**, even if it is **falsely affirmed** that what is digitally
rendered needs no **commentary**]{.underline}. Put differently, [[the
image **levels the event** it represents by entering into]{.mark} a
mass/**global** [**indifferent** **exchange**]{.mark}, into a virulent
**global** (representational) **circulation** [that **murders
singularity**]{.mark}]{.underline} or, indeed, the moment of trauma (on
this question of the erasure of trauma, see Debrix, 2008: 4-5; Edkins,
2003: 37-38). [The **enigmatic singularity** of the event---which, for
Baudrillard, was once a **precondition** for any sort of **historical
transition**---gives way to an **endlessness** of **representation**,
whether such representation appears to have a clear **ethical** or
political **purpose**/**signification** or not.]{.underline} [It is in
this always **operative tendency** of rendered appearances to **yield
meaning** (even if their meaning is to be **information-worthy)**, not
in the image or event itself, that we situate the **conditions** of
**possibility** and **reproducibility** for the ever-thickening
**representational fog** and for the **violence**/virulence of
**images**, or better yet, of **appearances**. [To make war]{.mark} or,
as the case may be, the terror event **[mean something]{.mark}**---even
in some of the most immediate reactions often designed to evoke
injustice or, indeed, incomprehension---[is the **generative point of
violence**]{.mark}, the **source** of **representation** as a
**virulent**/virtual **code** and **mode of
signification**.]{.underline} Baudrillard writes, "[Everywhere one seeks
to **produce meaning**, to make the world **signify**, to **render it
visible**]{.underline}." He adds, "[[We are not, however, in danger of
**lacking meaning**]{.underline}]{.mark}; \[...\] [[we are **gorged with
meaning**]{.mark} and [it is **killing** **us**]{.mark}]{.underline}"
(Baudrillard, 1988: 63). Indeed, [the **Western world**---increasingly,
the global---has found itself with a **proliferation** of **meanings**
and **significations**]{.underline} in the late 20th and early 21st
centuries.

[It is as if the so-called **crisis of nihilism**]{.underline} (thought
to be characteristic of much critique and philosophical suspicion
throughout the 20th century) **[later on produced something of the
opposite order]{.underline}**. [[The mass violence of the 20th century
inaugurated]{.mark} not a complete void of despair or meaninglessness,
but instead **a flood of meaning, if not an overproduction of
it**]{.underline}. [Baudrillard refers to this **frantic explosion of
meaning/signification** as "**a panic-stricken production of the real**
and the **referential**, above and parallel to **the panic of material
production**]{.underline} \[...\]" (Baudrillard, 1983: 7). Here,
Baudrillard describes a mode of production of a different kind, not
motivated by class interests or exploitation of value, but by an
automated, perhaps viral, abreaction to the empty core or disenchantment
of things and the world: that is to say, [the degree to which things
seem to lack a singular center of gravity or have lost a justifiable
reference to the real world, and yet each thing that "matters" is also
an attempt to get at reality as a question of accumulation (of meaning),
circulation (of signs), and filling up of all interstitial spaces of
communication and value]{.underline}. **[The end result is [an
over-abundance of signs and images of reality]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
something [that culminates in]{.underline} what Baudrillard calls
**[[hyperreality]{.underline}]{.mark}**---**[things appear more real
than reality itself]{.underline}**. The story that needs to be told is
thus not about the undoubtedly deplorable "truth" or fact of explosive
and warlike violence, but about a violence of another sort. [In the
radical digital transparency of the global scene, we (members of the
demos) often have full or direct exposure to explosivity, as we saw
above with the image of terror. But [what still needs to be thought and
problematized is]{.mark}]{.underline} implosivity or what may be called
**[[implosive violence]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Implosive violence is a
violence for which we do not, and perhaps will never, have much of a
language]{.underline} (Rancière, 2007: 123). Although, not having a
language for it or, rather, as we saw above, [seeking to find a language
to talk about it and, perhaps, to make sense of it is still sought
after]{.underline}. [This is]{.underline}, perhaps, [what digital
pictures of war/terror violence seek to capture or want to force
through]{.underline}. [[Implosive violence]{.underline},]{.mark} often
digitally rendered these days, [is in **close contact** with **media
technologies and representational devices** and techniques because it
[seeks **representation and meaning**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is why
[[implosive violence insists on]{.mark} calling in wars (against
terror]{.underline}, for example) [and]{.underline} on [[mobilizing war
machines]{.mark} (against terrorist others, against vague enemy
figures), but wars and war machines [that **no longer
have**]{.mark}---**to the extent that they ever had**---[a **clearly
identifiable object**]{.mark} **and subject**, or a **clear
mission/purpose**]{.underline}. As such, [[this **implosive violence and
its wars**]{.mark} (the **new Western/global way of war**, perhaps)
[must remain]{.mark} **uncertain**, **unclear**, **foggy**, **inwardly
driven**, **representational**, and indeed
**[virulent]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [They **must remain uncertain and
confused** even as they are **digitally operative** and **desperately
capture events/images** [to give the impression that
**meanings**]{.mark}**/significations [can and will be
found]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Yet, as we saw above, **[it is
not meanings exactly that must be found, but information and the endless
guarantee of its immediate circulation]{.underline}**. [As information
occupies the empty place of meaning, certainty, or truth, images must be
**instantaneously turned into appearances** that **search for meanings**
that will **never be discovered** because, instead, a **[proliferation
of information-worthy facts and beliefs will take
over]{.mark}**]{.underline} (**[perhaps this is what US fake pundit and
comedian Stephen Colbert famously referred to as
"truthiness]{.underline}**"). Or, as Baudrillard puts it, "**[free from
its former enemies, [humanity now has to create enemies]{.mark} from
within, which in fact produces a wide variety of inhuman
metastases]{.underline}**" (Baudrillard, 2003). Thus, [this [**implosive
violence** is destined to be **a global violence**]{.mark} since it \"is
the **product of a system [that tracks down any]{.mark} form of
negativity** and **[singularity]{.mark}**, including of course **death**
as the **ultimate form of singularity**]{.underline}. \[...\] [It is a
violence that]{.underline}, in a sense, **[puts an end to violence
itself and strives [to establish a world where]{.mark} anything related
to [the natural must disappear]{.mark}]{.underline}** \[...\] [Better
than a global violence, we should call it a **global
virulence**]{.underline}. **[This form of violence is indeed
viral]{.underline}**. [It moves by contagion, produces by chain
reaction, and little by little it destroys our immune systems and our
capacities to resist]{.underline}\" (2003; our italics).

#### Theory must wage war on the reality principle, ciphering instead of deciphering the Event so that it cannot be terrorized by the hegemony of the code. Our semiotic insurrection performatively enacts an intervention into the real that shatters what was once self-evidence into so many shards of confusion.

[[The **production of war signs** is linked to the issue of war]{.mark}
not only [in]{.mark} matters of [content, but also]{.mark} **in matters
of [form]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [Content-wise, war is just one
of many fields in which reality signs are produced; regarding its
form]{.underline}, however, **[[it is the pure logic of war itself that
works]{.mark} in this industry]{.underline}**. **[[The production of
reality]{.underline}]{.mark}** for Baudrillard **[[is a kind of
warfare]{.mark} itself]{.underline}**: [Not only is it a monologue of
power, a "speech without response]{.underline}", as he states in Requiem
for the Media (1971: 172); [even more, **[the "terrorism of the
code"]{.mark}**]{.underline} (ibid.: 179) [**[is a war-like attack on
our senses]{.underline}**.]{.mark}

[**We, the viewers, are targets of a bombardment of signs and images**.
"Semiocracy"]{.underline}, Baudrillard (1976: 78) [calls this terror in
his writing on the New York Graffiti scene: [**we live under a
dictatorship of signs** (against which **the Graffiti raise their
anti-semiotic counterforce**)]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [The war sign
industry]{.underline}]{.mark} [is just one of many subdivisions of a
society-wide **'reality sign industry'** that **[floods our lives with
all kinds of spectacular products and
information]{.mark}**]{.underline}[. "[We are **all hostages of media
intoxication, induced to believe in the war**]{.underline}]{.mark} [just
as we were once led to believe in the revolution in Romania, [and
**confined to the simulacrum of war as though confined to
quarters**]{.mark}. We are already all strategic hostages in situ; our
site is the screen on which we are virtually bombarded day by
day]{.underline}" (Baudrillard 1991b: 25).

[Finally now, this is where Baudrillard's genuine theoretical
intervention takes place]{.underline}. **[Like the Graffiti writers,
[Baudrillard attempts to fight back against the terrorism of the code
and its work of purification---somehow continuing Graffiti writing by
other means]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Baudrillard is [leading his
own]{.mark} war, **his own [counter-guerilla warfare]{.mark}** [against
**the reality principle**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} What are his
spray cans? Which are the walls on which he puts his 'mark on society'?
[It is the holy walls of theoretical discourse that Baudrillard defaces
with **[a low tech weapon called "theoretical
terrorism"]{.mark}**]{.underline}, as he called it once (Baudrillard
1983a: 91, my translation)---**[a thinking [made to oppose, to challenge
the hegemony of reality]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}

[The idea of 'theoretical terrorism' is strongly linked to his concept
of
"[reversibility]{.mark}]{.underline}"[13](http://www.ubishops.ca/baudrillardstudies/vol-11_2/v11-2-strehle.html#ft-endnote13) ---a
key term in Baudrillard's thinking. [The term may be characterized by
two main aspects: At first, it refers to the reciprocity of gift
exchange in which there is no closure of exchange but an endless
changing and challenging of sides]{.underline}. In this regard, **[it
[is a name for the symbolic fluidity of
power]{.mark}]{.underline}**.[14](http://www.ubishops.ca/baudrillardstudies/vol-11_2/v11-2-strehle.html#ft-endnote14) 
[At second, it refers to [a principle of changing a situation by
radically reversing its viewing angle---"**poetic transference of the
situation**]{.mark}]{.underline}["]{.mark}, as Baudrillard calls it
in Impossible Exchange (1999: 85).

Being a rather "phantastic principle" (Zapf 2010: 145, my translation),
[the concept of reversibility is linked with the most powerful and yet
most clandestine subtext in Baudrillard's oeuvre:
**'Pataphysics**]{.underline}. [The idea behind this absurd science of
"imaginary solutions" is as simple as it is mysterious: **It is an
attempt [to create a different reality through
imagination]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark}[15](http://www.ubishops.ca/baudrillardstudies/vol-11_2/v11-2-strehle.html#ft-endnote15) 
**[[Pataphysicians fight reality]{.mark} through the use of imaginary
forces, through [creating illusion and deceit]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

It is easily overlooked how central this pataphysical approach has been
for Baudrillard; even his most serious book, Symbolic Exchange and
Death, is surprisingly full of pataphysical statements, especially in
the dense, programmatic introductory pages: "[**The only strategy
against the hyperrealist system** is **some form of pataphysics**, 'a
**science of imaginary solutions'**; that is, **a science-fiction of the
system's reversal against itself** at the **extreme limit of
simulation**, a **reversible simulation** in **a hyperlogic of death**
and **destruction**]{.underline}" (Baudrillard 1976: 4 f.).

How can "science-fiction" shatter the system of reality? Baudrillard
explains his strategy later in The Perfect Crime (1995), especially in
the section on "Radical Thought", and in Impossible Exchange (1999).
[**[Ideas]{.underline}**,]{.mark} he claims, **[[can create their own
reality, since thinking is a performative act t]{.mark}hat builds its
own 'parallel world']{.underline}**: "[Thought \[...\] **does not seek
to penetrate some mystery of the world**, nor to **discover its hidden
aspect**---**it is that hidden aspect**]{.underline}. [It **does not
discover** that **the world has a double life**---**it is that double
life**, that **parallel life**]{.underline}" (Baudrillard 1999: 149).
[In the performative "act of thinking]{.underline}" (ibid.: 115),
**[[reality is not so much depicted but
challenged]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[The purpose of theory]{.mark} for
Baudrillard is **the exact opposite** of what we normally would expect:
It **s[hould not recognize and analyze reality]{.mark}**[, instead **it
must deny and contradict its hegemony**]{.mark}]{.underline}[. **[It has
to create illusion and establish a power of seduction that makes one
lose the path of reality]{.underline}**]{.mark}. [The "value of
thought]{.underline}", claims Baudrillard (1995: 94), "[lies not so much
in its inevitable convergences with truth as in **the immeasurable
divergences which separate it from truth**]{.underline}."

Only in awareness of those abstract 'Pataphysics can we distill any
sense out of some of the oddest remarks in Baudrillard's oeuvre, for
example his "delirious self-criticism" from Cool Memories where he
accuses himself of "having surreptitiously mixed my phantasies in with
reality" and of "having systematically opposed the most obvious and
well-founded notions" (Baudrillard 1987: 38). He even complains about
readers taking his theories for actual facts and reading them in a
"realist version": "Simulacra are today accepted everywhere in their
realist version: simulacra exist, simulation exists. It is the
intellectual and fashionable version of this vulgarization which is the
worst: all is sign, signs have abolished reality, etc." (Ibid.: 227).

Instead of this "realist version", [Baudrillard suggests that even his
most prominent terms can be regarded as pataphysical attempts to seduce
his readers through fictitious ideas]{.underline}, for example [when he
admits to having "put forward the idea of simulacrum, without really
believing in it, even hoping that the real will refute it]{.underline}"
(Baudrillard 1995: 101). Apparently [he understands his thinking to be
**something like a playful simulacrum itself**, for also **theory can
precede**---and thereby **seduce**---**reality**]{.underline}: "[The
theoretical ideal would be to set in place propositions in such a way
that they could be **disconfirmed by reality**, in such a way that
**reality could only oppose them violently**, and thereby **unmask
itself**]{.underline}. **[For reality is an illusion, and all thought
must seek first of all to unmask it]{.underline}**. To do that, [it must
itself **advance behind a mask** and **constitute itself as a decoy**,
without regard for its own truth. \[\...\] **Reality must be caught in
the trap**, we must **move quicker than reality**]{.underline}" (ibid.:
99).

In this sense, **[Baudrillard's writing is
"theory-fiction]{.underline}**" (Baudrillard 1991c: 202) [rather than
theory]{.underline}, as he borrows a term from Jean-François Lyotard
(1979: 92 f., cp. Blask, 2002: 133).  [Like all 'Pataphysics, this
notion of "theory-fiction" may be traced back to [the **surrealists**
and their "**poetic anthropology**]{.mark}]{.underline}[",]{.mark} as
Dietmar Kamper (1981, my translation) has called it. [Such an
anthropology is "poetic" because it refers to **the art of writing**,
but also because it **touches the original notion of "poiesis"**,
meaning **to create something**]{.underline}. '**[Poetic anthropology'
[do]{.mark}es [not seek to describe a reality that lies out
there]{.mark}, instead [it aims to autopoietically produce the subject
it writes about through its own act of
description]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}

[Theory]{.underline} for Baudrillard [is a **"paradoxical political
intervention"**]{.underline} (Zapf 2010: 241, my translation). [Thinking
itself has to become **the ambiguous kind of
"singularity"**]{.underline} (Baudrillard 1995: 96) [and
**"event"**]{.underline} (ibid.: 104) [that is **eliminated** from
almost **any other sphere of the system**]{.underline}: "[**[Cipher, do
not decipher]{.mark}**. Work over the illusion. **Create illusion** to
**create an event**. [**Make enigmatic what is clear**, **render
unintelligible** what is only too intelligible, **make the event itself
unreadable**.]{.mark} Accentuate the **false transparency** of the
**world** to **spread a terroristic confusion about it**, or the **germs
or viruses** of **a radical illusion**---in other words, **a radical
disillusioning of the real."**]{.underline} (Ibid.: 104).

Maybe this is the most unique aspect of [Baudrillard]{.underline}'s
thinking altogether. He [is a thinker who **tries to think the world
different from what it actually is**]{.underline}. [He sees himself as
something like **a smuggler or drug dealer**, pushing **forbidden
items** on a "**black market in thought"**]{.underline} (Baudrillard
1999: 104), [promoting "**a clandestine trade in ideas**, of **all
inadmissible ideas**, of **unassailable ideas**, as the liquor trade had
to be promoted in the 1930s]{.underline}" (Baudrillard 1995: 104 f.).

[If Baudrillard is **the drug dealer of sociology**, what does this
imply for his analysis of war and his reference to the principles of
symbolic exchange and the duel form?]{.underline} [If]{.underline} we
want to believe [[Baudrillard]{.underline}]{.mark} that he [[is **not
interested in rehabilitating older wars**]{.mark}, we should read his
reference **systematically** rather than historically]{.underline}
[16](http://www.ubishops.ca/baudrillardstudies/vol-11_2/v11-2-strehle.html#ft-endnote16)---[there
might have **never been any historical war** as **glamorous and
honorable** as portrayed by Clausewitz anyway]{.underline}. Hence, [[the
introduction of symbolic exchange and the duel principle into the
analysis of war might be more like **a strategy to introduce a different
view of things **into the **common perception of war**]{.underline}. [It
delivers the **necessary contrast** against which the **aestheticized**,
**whitewashed reality** of the war can be **scrutinized and
deconstructed** as **not the only possible reality of
war**]{.underline}. [Only in **the light of its radical other** can the
**reality of war** be **denaturalized and revealed** as **a self-display
of power and hegemony**]{.underline}.]{.mark}

In this regard, [[Baudrillard has always remained a critical thinker who
seeks to **intervene into reality instead of just observing**]{.mark}
**it**]{.underline}. To the same degree [he is neither a cynic nor a
fatalist, that is---a resigned thinker]{.underline}. On the contrary, in
an interview on the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center he even
aligns himself with the ideas of the Enlightenment: "[Fatalism offers an
unpalatable interpretation of the world, for it leads to resignation. I
don't resign myself, I want clarity, a lucid consciousness. When we know
the rules of the game, then we can change them. In this respect, **I am
a man of the Enlightenment**]{.underline}" (Baudrillard 2002b). There is
one major difference, though, between Baudrillard and the classical
Enlightenment: [[He wishes for "clarity" and lucidity, he wants to "know
the rules of the game", but he **does not seek the truth**; **he wants
to "change" the rules of the game by diverting the game from its
truth.**]{.underline}]{.mark}

[It does not seem to matter]{.underline} so much to Baudrillard
[if]{.underline} his instance of [contrast]{.underline}---[symbolic
exchange and the duel principle---is more fictitious or real,
illusionary or true; most possibly it has **something of both sides**,
being **undecidable** like a **simulacrum** in the strongest
sense]{.underline}. [When Baudrillard writes about **the Gulf War**, he
creates **an odd mixture of lucid observations** on the one hand and
**theoretical seductions** on the other]{.underline}. [If there could
ever be something like **'war studies'** in the spirit of Baudrillard,
they would have to **dare not to eliminate this undecidability**,
otherwise **they would lose the spirit**.]{.underline}

**[[What matters]{.mark} the [most]{.mark} for Baudrillard [is the
effort to break open the uniform process of reality production and
shatter its seeming self-evidence into pieces]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
**[Theory]{.underline}** according to Baudrillard [is an attempt
to **reverse our view of the world**---**shifting our perspective** by
**introducing something new and unsettling** into **the order of
things**]{.underline}. [What **seemed natural before**, now starts **to
look artificial**; what **presented itself as a glorious triumph**
suddenly **appears stale**; **what was evident becomes
shady**]{.underline}. **[Baudrillard's theories are like evil ghosts:
They haunt reality by staging its excluded other---no matter if this
other really exists or if it has to be feigned.]{.underline}**

## Process Warfare 1NC

#### **Traditional understandings of war as an antagonistic exchange between adversarial nations conceals the way war functions as an [operational process.]{.underline} The perfection of this process produces a seamless economy of violence that liquidates all subjectivity and meaning.**

College, Stockholm, "Targeting the Ontology of War: From Clausewitz to
Baudrillard" in Millennium: Journal of International Studies 43 (2):
399-403) \*we don't endorse ableist language

**[In [Baudrillard']{.mark}s notorious critique of the Gulf war he
[identifies traditional conceptions of war]{.mark} as [involvi]{.mark}ng
the ontology we have seen in critical war studies and contemporary
military doctrine: 'war is born of [an antagonistic]{.mark}, destructive
but dual [relation between]{.mark} two
[adversaries']{.mark}]{.underline}**.40 However, he argues, **[[if this
is war, then there is no war taking place]{.mark} in the
Gulf.]{.underline}** One important but hereto neglected reason for this
argument is Baudrillard's claim that **[[war has disappeared
into]{.mark} the [processing]{.mark} of warfare.]{.underline}**
Baudrillard never fully developed this discussion, but he wrote
extensively on the subject from a general perspective in his final
works. Therein Baudrillard points to the way **[[subjectivity disappears
in operational processing]{.mark} as part of the attempt [to fulfil and
perfect potential]{.mark}]{.underline}**.41 Baudrillard sees
**[subjectivity [becoming]{.mark} a subordinated [part of technological
media]{.mark}, 'a perfectly operational molecule that is left to its own
devices and doomed to \... reproduce, self-identically, to
infinity'.]{.underline}**42 In his view, **[we are faced with a
situation in which [subjectivity, social relations and will are]{.mark}
essentially [liquidated by operational practices]{.mark}. They are not
supplanted by a higher will or a higher purpose. Rather, [they vanish
into processing entirely devoid of symbolic
meaning.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

[This indicates that it is not physical disappearance Baudrillard
discusses, but disappearance which strictly relates to the
symbolic.]{.underline} Baudrillard on numerous occasions illustrated
this idea through Alfred Jarry's novel *The Supermale*, which tells a
story of how automated processing dissolves limits between man and
technology. The apex of the story is a 10,000-mile bicycle race -- the
perpetual motion race -- which takes place between a five-man bicycle
and an express train. In the race the cyclists function as a
collaborative machine to challenge the train over long distance. The
cyclists reach a speed that enables them to ride side by side with the
locomotive -- to become limitless automatons in the rhythm of the
machine. This becoming comes at a price, since the cyclists gradually
disappear as humans, as they reach the speed of the train. One of them
disappears quite literally as he dies on his post. However, his
decomposing corpse, strapped to the bicycle, pedals on. The corpse
stands as a symbolic marker for how the rest of the bodies also
disappear by being absorbed into the process itself. In the end, the
five-man machine rides alongside the train with the living and dead
corpses riding at maximum speed in order to keep up. This theme, of
transformation of man into machine, is also evident in the rest of the
novel, which ends with its key figure dying while transforming into a
machine.43

As Rex Butler points out, the novel helps to draw up the:

**[\[V\]ision of a society in \... which [humans are
unnecessary]{.mark}. We see this vision coming true [in]{.mark} those
self-enclosed and [self-perpetuating systems of
simulation]{.mark}]{.underline}** that Baudrillard analyses, **[[which
have no outside]{.mark}]{.underline}** and no need to be explained by an
other, and whose best model would be the bicycle proposed by Alfred
Jarry, which still continues to pedal long after its riders have passed
away with fatigue.44

[[The image]{.underline}]{.mark} Jarry paints in the novel [[illustrates
**the symbolic disappearance of subjectivity by emphasising the
repetitive and inherently meaningless relationship we have with various
media**]{.mark} **that surround us. [The attempt to reach a perfect
speed and efficiency by way of the mechanic process works back on
subjectivity]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

**[It is not far-fetched to see the [recent conceptual inventions in
military thought, such as the Effects Based Approach to
Operations]{.mark}]{.underline}** (EBAO), **[[Comprehensive
Approach]{.underline}]{.mark}** (CA), **[[or Network Centric
Warfare]{.underline}]{.mark}** (NCW), as part of the characteristic that
Baudrillard is concerned with and Jarry's novel illustrates. The common
denominator of **[these concepts]{.underline}** is the way they
**[[attempt to synchronise, coordinate, and make warfare more
efficient]{.mark} through staff procedures. They are all based on the
idea that [perfect operationalisation generates a war in which all means
and capabilities are interconnected in]{.mark} ways that aim to create
[a seamless economy of violence]{.mark}. This in turn indicates that
[the subject of warfare dissolves into operationalised
repetition]{.mark}. Such an argument does not entail that militaries,
insurgents, weapon-systems, logistical capacities and so forth are
disappearing on a material level. Rather, as part of a symbolic
disappearance through the fulfilments of technological processes,
[warfare strives towards perfection]{.mark} and symbolic aspects
disappear through a model which is being operationalised as if it is
war. This should not be taken to mean that there is an end to violence
or suffering. [There is]{.mark} of course [bodily violence and
death]{.mark} in military operations [despite the attempt to fulfil
wars' every potential through repeated calls for 'high-precision
munition' and 'zero-death warfare'. However, processing and repetition
also participate in making the representation of bodies and subjects
disappear in operationalisation.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

The concern here is that **[[focusing on]{.mark} the violence displayed
in [war-as-fighting might obscure a systemic violence]{.mark} which
stems from the way [in which war is
operationalised]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Baudrillard argues that **[[the
type of violence the military normally battles]{.mark} (such as
terrorism) [is far less lethal than the violence which replaces the
subject with]{.mark} the will of [an operational and technocratic
structure]{.mark}]{.underline}**.45 What we have, then, is **[a certain
kind of disappearance]{.underline}** which **[is obscured
by]{.underline}** (among other things) **[the focus on war as violent
exchange between subjects.]{.underline}**

How do **[we go from the ontology of war as generative to an ontology of
war as disappearance]{.underline}**? To understand the transition it is
helpful to return to the idea that **[war is considered generative as it
exceeds social orders.]{.underline}** Albeit helpful in order to
understand war's excess in terms of productivity it is also possible to
understand excess differently, as a force of disappearance. Baudrillard
argues that **[social reality disappears not because of a lack, but
rather because of excess, arguing precisely that wars fought by the US
tend to be 'wars of excess']{.underline}**.46 **[One under-analysed
aspect of the ontology of war is therefore the way in which the excess
it gives rise to is not simply generative of appearances, but in turn
forces disappearances.]{.underline}** If we complement the generative
notion of war's excess with Baudrillard's argument that **[excess is in
and of itself a cause of disappearance]{.underline}**, we can appreciate
that **[the ontology of war might at times be generative, and at times
erase the preconditions for appearance.]{.underline}** On one hand it is
correct that bodies, experience or materiality frame our understanding
of war by generating narratives. On the other it is important to
acknowledge that **[[subjectivity disappears through the excess of the
processes themselves]{.mark}. Through such an acknowledgement we can see
that warfare conditions the possibility of appearance as it 'always,
already' works as a process of disappearance.]{.underline}** Arguably
targeting is a prime example of the latter.

Although Baudrillard highlights technology as integral to the effect of
war's disappearance into process, he does not dwell on the exact
mechanisms it entails. This is a task that we therefore undertake here.
The next part examines **[the military targeting process]{.underline}**
as one example of the attempt to create the perfect war. This process
**[creates 'an iterative logical methodology for development, planning,
execution, and assessment of effective- ness']{.underline}**.47 In what
follows, we examine how **[[this methodology works to rid war of its
underlying principles: subjectivity, antagonism and
exchange]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

Target Processing and the Disappearance of War

How are we to interpret targeting doctrines? As Josef Teboho Ansorge
argues, [military doctrine has a particular form of arrangement, which
helps to 'both describe and make the world]{.underline}'.48 [Doctrinal
text relies heavily on abbreviations and contains an impersonal and
administrative language]{.underline}. It is as if the potential for
symbolism -- for the text to mean more than itself -- has been
subtracted from the paragraphs in favour of Orwellian 'new- speak'. We
might say that **[[military doctrines]{.mark} not only make a world
appear, but also [dissolve meaning]{.mark} and are therefore acts of
disappearance]{.underline}**. **[We can also read the charts,
appendices, images, power-point slides, meeting protocols and
organisational routines as part of this disappearance.]{.underline}**
One amusing example is the well-known and extremely intricate
'Afghanistan Stability/COIN dynamics' slide (also called 'the sprawling
spaghetti diagram') which went viral in 2010.49 This slide was supposed
to convey meaning about how to 'win' the war in Afghanistan. The flow
chart listed pretty much every targetable process relating to irregular
warfare as part of this attempt. While it utterly failed to make the
conflict meaningful (despite its excess of meaning) it succeeded, by
virtue of becoming an overexposed internet joke, **[to obscure the fact
that war-as-fighting, or war as such, had long since
disappeared]{.underline}** from Afghanistan.

**[A common conception of targeting processes is that they are related
to the operational level of warfare]{.underline}** (linking tactical
with strategic and political aims). **[As such they are an integral part
of how warfare aims to translate strategic aims into tactical
effects]{.underline}** (and *vice versa*). **[[Military doctrine
represents targeting as the process of selecting and prioritising
targets and matching actions]{.mark} in order to achieve strategic
objectives.]{.underline}**50 **[The purpose of targeting is therefore to
'provide the commander with a methodology' and 'a logical
progression']{.underline}**.51 **[This is done by virtue of constructing
targets, conceptualising them as a system, linking them to outcomes as
part of synchronising other parts of military operations, and [by
creating organisational routines]{.mark} -- all with the aim of
supporting the 'battle- rhythm'.]{.underline}**52 Technically speaking,
[a battle-rhythm can be understood as 'the combination \... of
procedures, processes \... and \... actions' which 'facilitates
extended-continuous operations'.]{.underline}53 **[Taken to its limit,
this implies [heeding the tempo of the operational process regardless
of]{.mark} human [subjectivity]{.mark}]{.underline}** (just like the
bike-train in Jarry's novel). In the doctrines, **[effective targeting
is measured by how well it facilitates operational planning and chosen
objectives in an area of operations]{.underline}**.54 Importantly, it is
also measured by how well it enables a particular tempo during
operations. Consequently, **[[targeting]{.mark} ideally [strives towards
maximum efficiency]{.mark} according to the model constructed in
operational planning, [while agency disappears]{.mark} in the search for
a perfect process.]{.underline}**

If we look closely at **[the underlying principles of
targeting]{.underline}** we notice that they **[do not emphasise
adversaries, exchange or antagonism, but focus on how to perfect the
model of warfare.]{.underline}** We read in *JP 3-60* that key
principles are: coordination and synchronisation, rapid response, a
minimal duplication of effort, expeditious assessments of executed
operations, a common perspective on targeting efforts, and a full
integration of capabilities of the process. This means that **[targeting
provides a cycle to describe how warfare should be
conducted.]{.underline}**55 This cycle is on the one hand indicative of
a methodology of contemporary warfare, and **[[the actualisation of a
model that makes war a type of processing ad
infinitum.]{.underline}]{.mark}** [War gets its own (battle) rhythm,
which territorialises a space (the area of operations) and the pace of
the operation (into current time and future time).]{.underline} **[This
creates a reality-principle which helps us appreciate that the war
conducted is a modelled, repeatable war. It is dispersed into an
enormous amount of operational meetings, power- points, steering groups
and so forth.]{.underline}**

On the other hand, **[we can read [targeting]{.mark} as a subtraction of
meaning which [pulverises subjectivity through attempted
perfection.]{.mark}]{.underline}** On a symbolic level **[there is no
'warrior' in this warfare]{.underline}**. Granted, the doctrines often
invoke subjects such as 'the warfighter' or 'the targeteer' as those who
are supposed to decide upon, detect, deliver effects of, and assess the
targeting process.56 However, **[[the 'agent']{.mark} here [is the
medium itself which helps to reduce each aspect of subjectivity into
fractal,]{.mark} self-identical [molecules which]{.mark} merely
[mirror]{.mark} functions of [the process]{.mark}.]{.underline}** This
is not to say that individuals are absent from targeting. [The
nomination and approval of potential targets is a process that involves
not only the military but also politicians, lawyers, political advisors,
gender advisors and environ- mental advisors, to mention but a few. It
also involves a number of boards]{.underline} (such as the Joint Target
Coordination Board, Joint Target Working Groups), lists (Target
Nomination List, Joint Integrated Prioritized Target List), and support
cells (Target Support Cell, Information Operation Cell), [all involving
complex meeting schedules. Not to mention what the doctrine aptly calls
'the myriad processes, sub-processes, and cycles associated with joint
targeting']{.underline}.57 Through these, **[[target-processing
proclaims to be]{.mark} concerned with means and ends, thus linking
tactics to politics and [creating a seamless economy of
violence.]{.mark} What it really accomplishes is [to make subjectivity
disappear in the excess of the process itself.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Judith Butler argues in *Frames of War* that:

Surely, common sense tells us that persons wage war, not the instruments
they deploy**[. [But what happens if the instruments acquire their own
agency, such that persons become extensions of those
instruments?\...]{.mark}]{.underline}** persons use technological
instruments, but instruments surely also use persons (position them,
endow them with perspective, and establish the trajectory of their
action).58

We similarly ask **[[what happens when the process of warfare as such
acquires its own momentum, uses persons, and forms and erases
subjectivity]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In short, **[what happens when the
process becomes not only the means but also the end-point]{.underline}**
of war? Importantly, **[if the subject is disappearing in repetitive
excess, what happens to the enemy Other]{.underline}**?

#### Operationalized war processing accelerates: everything becomes a target destined for annihilation.

Baudrillard" in Millennium: Journal of International Studies 43 (2):

As *JP 3-60* states no target is critical in and of itself. A target is
measured only by how it is part of target-sets, target-systems or
matrices.59 However, on a symbolic level, a target is nothing but a
'target folder'. This folder contains mainly a classification code, a
name, coordinates, photograph and information on which weapons are
suitable for usage. Since a target in the doctrines is 'an area,
complex, installation, force, equipment, capability, function or
behaviour identified for possible action'60 **[[the process subsumes all
possible things as targets:]{.mark} subjects, objects, ideas, emotions,
networks]{.underline}**.61 Therefore, **[although targeting involves
violence it does so not as exchange, or as symbolic appearance, but
rather as an inclusion of 'targetable' objects. Targets depend on the
targeting procedure itself, as it processes objects through meetings,
nominations, and documents into the end-point of a spreadsheet. In this
sense [the target is a result of a medium that erases the]{.mark} very
[conditions of its appearance and forces it symbolically and literally
to disappear]{.mark} as object.]{.underline}**

As targets are nominated by a number of organisational sub-components
(such as tactical army, navy or air force staff) one integral aspect is
to keep up with the pace of operations. Low-ranking commanders typically
need to nominate targets in order to keep up with the battle-rhythm.
**[[Processing demands an excess of targets]{.underline}]{.mark}**
(which is also an excess of disappearances), **[enough [so that the
medium is saturated]{.mark}, which occurs at meetings when the
spreadsheets are full and nothing more can be acted upon. In fact, the
doctrines explicitly state that there will always be more targets in an
area of operations than it is possible to destroy]{.underline}**.62 As
Peter Row puts it (with regards to the NATO bombings in Kosovo):
'\[t\]he reality of the situation is that those objects which military
commanders wished to attack, for whatever reason, were attacked'.63
**[The milieu of warfare is in this sense very much a derivative of its
process as a military methodology. However, the methodology includes all
manner of things as targets, and their disappearance has less to do with
wishing destruction]{.underline}** (as Row claims) **[and more to do
with the way [antagonistic exchange is supplanted for the repetition of
war as a process.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

How are we to understand the temporal aspects of such targeting
processes? We have argued that **[[subjects disappear in the
'battle-rhythm']{.mark}.]{.underline}** If we look closely at the
temporal aspects of targeting we find that it involves planned aspects
and dynamic-real time aspects.64 What are we to make of this? [Planned
targeting is strictly speaking taking place from the future. The
organisational routine projects a number of days into the
future.]{.underline} Operational warfare does not take place merely in
real-time but also in future time. In the processing of targets the
meetings occur on 'D+3' or 'D+6'. It is one aspect of what we might call
operational time, where the present moment is appropriated by the
vantage point of a modelled future. In this modelling the possibility of
a human encounter in the here-now disappears, since 'now' has been
pre-planned days earlier. Dynamic (or time-sensitive) targeting on the
other hand is war in real-time from an instantaneous present. [**[This
process helps]{.mark} to follow and [take out targets in real-time as a
complement to pre-planned targeting]{.mark}**.]{.underline} This is a
costly and difficult part of targeting. The doctrines lament that so few
targets can be followed in real-time: 'not all targets can be tracked
constantly due to limited resources'.65 This arguably complements an
operational time that contains both an appropriated future and an
instantaneous present. Finally, [both aspects of targeting --
pre-planned and dynamic -- end up in delivery through a type of (weapon)
system. **[This delivery needs to be extremely high paced -- preferably
immediate]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Former United States Under-Secretary
of Defence William Perry sums up this principle: '**[[as soon as you can
see the target, you can expect to destroy it']{.underline}]{.mark}**.66
And indeed, **[a missile is absent until it hits the target. It appears
only to disappear and to make the world around it disappear in
turn.]{.underline}**

Thus, the temporal aspect of targeting can be understood as a
disappearance of encounters. **[Operational warfare does not work as an
antagonistic exchange between two opposing subjects,]{.underline}** at
least not from the perspective of the system generating these targeting
strategies. **[[Exchange and encounters disappear into]{.mark} the
[real-time]{.mark} of [dynamic targeting and]{.mark} in the future
[instant]{.mark} of [pre-planned targeting.]{.mark} The same happens to
the experiences, bodies or narratives introduced as a basis for a
different ontology of war. Targeting as a method and as part of war at a
distance makes encounters impossible.]{.underline}** In this type of
predetermined battle-rhythm, where the military duty is to attend and
facilitate this process, target nomination becomes repetitive and
mandatory. This means that **[[the battle-rhythm works as a 'processor'
that grinds out target]{.mark}s and applies not so much means to ends,
but rather the process itself as an end. [It is a kind of war 'so
predicted, programmed, anticipated, prescribed and modelled that it has
exhausted all its possibilities before even taking
place']{.mark}]{.underline}**.67 Just like Jarry's five-man machine had
to keep pace with the rhythm of the machine, so does the tandem of
soldiers need to keep pace with the battle-rhythm in operational
planning. [The repetitive procedures force a certain reality around war
to disappear.]{.underline} This aspect of disappearance is evident in
the way targeting involves a particular repetition, which develops
target packages, nominates targets, and tasks and weaponeers against
those targets.

What happens when we take this logic to its end-point? As we have seen,
**[targeting implies that everything in an 'area of operations' is a
possible target, and any area is a possible area of
operations]{.underline}**. Moreover, not all targets are possible to
track due to limited resources -- but ideally all targets are possible
to track at all times. **[[There is no agent left]{.mark} in this
procedure, as [it is replaced by the momentum of the targeting process
itself.]{.mark} Subsequently, [a target is not the Other of the
pulverised subject or of the targeting process -- but a folder
corresponding to something]{.mark} which is [destroyed as it
appears.]{.mark} There will always be more targets than it is possible
to destroy. The process aims to pre-plan them all into folders. Ideally
they can all be destroyed]{.underline}**. In short, **[symbolically,
every subject, object or exchange is potentially gone from the (global)
area of operations -- lost in the rhythm and scope that appropriates
them. When this is achievable in a seamless process -- efficient,
synchronised, integrated -- by virtue of operational modelling, we have
reached the perfect war.]{.underline}**

#### **The understanding of war as 'fighting' allows NATO's technical perfection of warfare as a process to continue unabated. Vote AFF to pull the chair out from under the policy maker/debater and compel an interrogation of processual warfare.**

The War that Remains

We have argued to this point that **[critical war
studies]{.underline}**, in Clausewitz's footsteps, is emerging as a
field of study that **[is strongly attached to a particular ontology of
'war']{.underline}**.

We have also argued, however, that **[[contemporary warfare]{.mark}
(particularly [in NATO countries) can]{.mark} alternatively [be
understood]{.mark}, not through the type of 'war' their ontology implies
(war-as-fighting), but rather [through]{.mark} various [operational
procedures.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Our point has been to suggest that
[[there is little or no symbolism left in a warfare]{.underline}]{.mark}
which processes targets as spreadsheets, target packages and
tasking-orders, through a predetermined rhythm of meetings [[which leads
it, not to a battlefield, but to an administrative
model]{.underline}]{.mark}. This model finds its ontology in Baudrillard
rather than in Clausewitz. **[Through military operations [we move from
war as antagonistic exchange]{.mark} between subjects, [to war as
technical realisation.]{.mark} The race between targeting process and
battle-rhythm resolves subjectivity, the Other and symbolic exchange
through the repetition of operational procedures. [This is not an
example of war-as-fighting, but the]{.mark} [enactment of a pre-planned
script.]{.mark} This characteristic is by no means exclusive to the
targeting process; rather it [is indicative of how military planning is
conducted in]{.mark} most [NATO]{.mark} countries. [It is]{.mark}
therefore [crucial to think of disappearance]{.mark} -- enabled and
exacerbated by the way warfare is infinitely repeated -- [as an integral
part of]{.mark} thinking about [an ontology of
war]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

However, if target-processing and associated ways of operationalising
warfare is making war in the Clausewitzean sense disappear, then [**[why
is warfare made to appear as fighting]{.underline}**? [We are constantly
immersed in 'war' through television, art, computer games,]{.underline}
]{.mark}[military recruiting campaigns, and arms industry projects.
[They call forth 'war' as antagonistic and generative
exchange.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[Consider]{.underline}]{.mark} the
(simulated) fighting between warriors in the stream of screenings that
includes [[Spartacus, 300, Troy, Braveheart, Apocalypto, or The Last
Samurai]{.underline}]{.mark}. Computer games centred on war and politics
-- *Civilization, Hearts of Iron, Total War* -- unfold through the idea
that war is a struggle between antagonistic forms of political life.
Andreas Behnke argues (correctly in our view) that **[[the Western
notion of war has lost its ontological grounding.]{.mark}]{.underline}**
He reads this as part of a paradox since despite its loss, **[[warfare
needs to be aestheticised and legitimised]{.underline}]{.mark}** 'beyond
the purely instrumental'.68 The explanation for why this is the case
often lies precisely in the way [representation helps [to reinforce and
militarise society, as it justifies a liberal world
order.]{.mark}]{.underline}[6]{.mark}9 [Arguably, this explanation
eschews the prior question of why the study of war needs to imagine an
antagonistic and generative war in the first place]{.underline}. What
does the idea that war is antagonistic and generative obscure? Or put
more crudely, **[[who gains from reifying war as]{.mark} 'war', or
war-as-[fighting?]{.mark}]{.underline}**

As an attempt to answer this we complement the prior explanation by
suggesting that **[[recent theories of 'war']{.mark} have underplayed
the way in which operational warfare is also, in and of itself, an act
of disappearance.]{.underline}** In doing so, **[they [over emphasise
genesis at the expense of disappearance, and obscure the loss of
exchange and subjectivity from the 'war']{.mark} they claim to depict,
at the same time as [they feed from its reification]{.mark} as such.
[This 'war' allows NATO's member countries to]{.mark} send out war
correspondents in body armour and helmets; to give first person
shooters]{.underline}** like *Battlefield* enough **[status as reality;
to give movies like Hurt-locker]{.underline}**, television dramas like
*Generation Kill*, and documentaries like *Armadillo* **[their necessary
ontological back-drop]{.underline}**. Moreover, **[it is there to allow
for [spend]{.mark}ing [vertiginous amounts of money on recruitment, arms
production, government transitions, advertising, aid, education
and]{.mark} -- last but not least -- [military operations and
target-processing.]{.mark} Crucially, ['war' is there to allow the
researcher to study war in peace]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[All of us
who feed from this are part of [an extreme reification]{.mark} of war --
which [hides]{.mark} not only [that 'war']{.mark} may have [ceased to be
a meaningful term which structures reality]{.mark}, but also that these
renditions of war is the closest we have to 'war']{.underline}** as it
is described by Clausewitz. **[The ontology of war debates in which we
engage are therefore part of this reification of war.]{.underline}**

In this way, [**[the distinction between an act of warfare and the
attempt to understand wars' underlying principles is lost through the
notion of war-as-fighting.]{.underline}** **[Every attempt
to]{.underline}** ]{.mark}**[wage war or [think war]{.mark} in its own
right]{.underline}** (or to oppose or neglect war for that matter)
**[[refers back to this loss of meaning and
distinction]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Understood in this way**[, the focus
of [research on the ontology of war]{.mark} or on better understanding
'war' as an object (to make it appear as meaningful), also [bestows a
reality to the attempts to deal with war.]{.mark} The question of
whether the notion of war as antagonistic and generative exchange is
real is therefore not the issue, as any ontology of war risks this type
of reification. Rather, [we should ask why it might seem so costly to
leave this particular ontology behind]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Could it
be because the various ways of grappling with war's ontology are active
parts of how this reality remains intact?

Should we (and could we) forget the reality of 'war'? Moreover**[, [is a
world without referents like 'war' a world with less violence?
No]{.mark},]{.underline}** says Baudrillard, it is not: **[['\[t\]he
immanence of the death of all the great referents \... is expressed by
exacerbating the forms of violence]{.mark} and representation that
characterized them']{.underline}**.70 This helps us understand why,
paradoxically**, [[in an era in which war-as-fighting has disappeared,
we all speak about it, analyse it, play it on our computers and
experience it through books and films]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- and why
a calling for war studies is a logical step in the disappearance of war-
as-fighting. This argument could be directed against other disciplines
too -- '[war' is not a privileged object in any respect.]{.underline}
Nonetheless, to call for a renewed discipline of 'war studies' --
encouraging as it may be, especially to all of us who receive research
funding based on the existence of such a discipline -- is therefore not
without problems**[. It is not so much a call for an understanding of
war as it is a call to supplant the absence of war in International
Relations with a particular categorical ~~blindness,~~ since [strictly
speaking war is never there]{.mark}. Rather, [it provides a 'simulation
of perspective']{.mark}]{.underline}** as Baudrillard would call it.71
**[The problem is that [the organised violence to which we constantly
refer has no other reality than that of the
model]{.mark}.]{.underline}**72 That is, **[it has no other reality than
the reality [provided by representations of war]{.mark}]{.underline}**
(which is not to say that they are one and the same). **[Through this
simulation, war returns as an imperative to thought. It is an
explanation or an understanding through a particular category ('war')
and not of a state of things (actions, reactions, challenges,
automatism, repetition, processing). 'War' works as an
imperative:]{.underline}**

**['You've got a military and you must learn how to use it well'\
'You've got a weapon-system and you must learn how to operate it'\
'You've got a target and you must learn how to task it'\
'You've got an ontology of war and you must learn how to think through
it.]{.underline}**'

Conclusion

War is understood in recent debates on critical **[war]{.underline}**
studies as **[characterised by antagonistic and generative
exchange.]{.underline}** This amounts to a view in which '**[[war' helps
provide a context in which acts of violence become meaningful]{.mark}.
They receive a pattern, reciprocity and a 'natural' demarcation that can
be named and criticised.]{.underline}** This article has argued that
contemporary understandings of war and warfare are well advised to find
new ontolog*ies* complementing the notion that war is fighting. We have
presented one such attempt, resonating with Baudrillard's notion of
war-processing, based on an analysis of the planning and conduct of
military operations (in NATO countries). This attempt outlines **[how
warfare strives towards its own 'perfect' and self-referential
model.]{.underline}** We illustrate this through an analysis of military
targeting so as to point to how **[[warfare becomes a reiterative and
automated process which constructs a seamless economy of
violence]{.mark}.]{.underline}** We read targeting **[as a perpetual
motion to keep up with the battle-rhythm of military
operations]{.underline}** and argue that it rids what is termed 'war' of
its underlying principles: adversaries, antagonism and exchange.

**[[An understanding of war which neglects this]{.mark} aspect [risks
missing that war (as processing]{.mark}) strictly speaking
[lacks]{.mark} an [antagonistic engagement]{.mark} with 'an enemy' and
in so doing calls into question many of the underlying principles that
the notion of war- as-fighting rests upon. Doing so leaves the theorist
of war and IR with a ~~blind~~ spot: the conception of 'war' that has
become operational while being obscured by the reification of 'war' as
fighting.]{.underline}** Barkawi and Brighton associate the absence of a
discipline of war studies with an 'othering of violence from inquiry'.74
We again state explicitly, therefore, that we are not advocating the
continuation of such othering. To say **[that war as processing lacks
antagonism is not to say that it lacks violence. [Warfare is a highly
violent practice but it]{.mark} [seems to occur amidst a breakdown of
symbolic relations between a subject and an Other]{.mark}. This would
point to acts of insurgency or terror being ways of acting out, rather
than a response as such.75 [The 'perfect war']{.mark} we have described
[is highly violent]{.mark} indeed -- [but that does not make it
'fighting'.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

This is not to say that war should be reduced to an automated process
between man and machine. Rather we want to point out that
**[[war-as-fighting neglects the way]{.mark} in which [subjectivity,
symbolism and exchange are]{.mark} often [lacking in military targeting
--]{.mark} something which needs to be considered if we are to better
understand the relationship between the ontic realty of warfare and the
ontology of war.]{.underline}** In light of our argument, **[the
ontology of war can be read not only as a way of thinking 'war' but also
as an imperative to thought.]{.underline}** We are aware that this
imperative does not work through simple causality. The targeting
doctrines we have looked at are not representative of all warfare. A
task for future research would be to contrast it to, for example, the
way 'insurgents' or 'civilians' subjected to military violence represent
warfare. Another would be to examine disappearance in the wider contexts
of counter-insurgency and network-centric warfare.

Nevertheless, [[there is a risk that (critical) war studies in invoking
the ontology of war- as-fighting is led back to an antagonistic and
generative exchange between subjects]{.underline}]{.mark} -- whether
this is actually taking place or not. [[Attempts to think of politics,
ethics, security or gender risk being forced through the mould of this
particular ontology of war]{.mark}.]{.underline} Following Baudrillard,
[an attempt to rethink and complement the ontology of war should
challenge it in a way that forces its 'truth to withdraw -- just as if
one were pulling the chair out from under someone about to sit
down']{.underline}.76 [**[We]{.mark} therefore [need to think war in a
way that pulls the chair out from underneath the gamer, policy maker,
military officer or theorist ]{.mark}**[a**bout to sit down to 'do
war'.**]{.mark}]{.underline} What does **[this act of ['pulling the
chair' from underneath thought]{.mark}]{.underline}** leave us with? Our
hope is that it **[[opens]{.mark} up]{.underline}** **[for [the
possibility of rethinking ontologies of war in a fashion that
helps]{.mark} us better understand and [challenge their relationship to
various ontic realities.]{.mark}]{.underline}** [Taking this question
seriously gives us a new vantage point on (critical) war studies for
future debates.]{.underline}

#### Academic activities like policy debate deploy [gatekeeping mechanisms and rankings]{.underline} that replicate [social stratification]{.underline}. The research methods of policy debate [contribute to global militarism]{.underline} by exporting neo-liberal and humanist ideals that seek to render [everything transparent.]{.underline}

and Culture at the Humanities Faculty of Utrecht University, Higher
Education and Technological Acceleration - The Disintegration of
University Teaching and Research. (180 p.). London: Palgrave Macmillan.
pp. 5-9

So to reiterate, the radical proposition of this book is that [the prime
mission or ideals of the university---namely those of total
emancipation, freedom, and the goals of knowledge accumulation---are
precisely what currently **produce** exceedingly unjust practices
'outside' and 'within' academia.]{.underline} [These unjust
practices]{.underline} [that it produces on its 'outside'
concern]{.underline} those of the [ongoing social stratification
via]{.underline} so-called [meritocratic education and]{.underline}
those of [sociological, computational, and psychological objectification
of ever more cultures and groups, while the unjust
practices]{.underline} on its ['inside' concern]{.underline} those of
[internal hierarchies, rankings, divisions, gatekeeping mechanisms, and
exclusions of all kinds]{.underline}. And because [the reproduction
of]{.underline} its [practices at base involve modern
techniques]{.underline} and technologies [of knowing]{.underline}, this
book suggests that rather than arguing for a return to the supposedly
'walled' university, however sympathetic, gaining a better understanding
of the intersection of this problematic with especially modern
technologies of communication, visibility, or calculation is crucial to
really thinking the modern university project differently. The book
therefore argues that [the central problem of the university today
consists of the acceleration of academia's unfinishable ideals by way of
an enmeshment with techniques and technologies of communication,
calculation, and prediction. The quest for transcendence through
technologically aided omniscience and universal connection---after all,
the term 'university' comes from the Latin universitas or the 'totality'
or 'total community'---has resulted in the **quest to render
everything** and everyone **transparent** and
understandable]{.underline}. As I will discuss more in depth through the
work of techno-pundit Paul Virilio[, the current university and
its]{.underline} [new forms of]{.underline} [violence are]{.underline}
therefore [an outflow]{.underline} or [intensification of 'outdated'
humanist ideals]{.underline} and techniques, [whose internal
contradictions have become usurped and **constantly remobilised by
neo-liberal capitalism** and its machinery of acceleration]{.underline}.
[We see the auto-immune aspect returning here as well, since that
contemporary machinery of the acceleration of omniscience in many of its
aspects---one need only to think of early cybernetic research,
innovations like the Arpanet, and engineering oriented models of
communication as noise cancellation---**has** again also]{.underline}
**[been carried out]{.underline}** at [least in large part by
universities]{.underline} (**[disturbingly often with the help of
military monies and establishments]{.underline}**, about the
significance of which more later). In other words, [the hopeful academic
project of 'exposing the world and humanity to the light of truth and
emancipation,' together with its damaging 'evil twins' of oppressive
universalism, social submission, surveillance, and colonialism, has
caved in onto themselves and become a near-pervasive technologically
'exposing-itself' of a fundamentally Janus-faced academia.]{.underline}
This is also to stress that [the ways in which academic research has
historically been part of Western imperialism should be considered more
closely]{.underline} when critically examining the faux-nostalgic calls
in many contemporary European universities for a 'return' to presumed
'research autonomy,' as well as [when analysing the kinds of seemingly
perverse 'knowledge-as- capital' arguments]{.underline} made by
contemporary universities in the post-colonies. I will provide divergent
examples from the Netherlands and Singapore of such tendencies in Chaps.
2 , 3 , and 4 . In light of the above, this book therefore also wants to
discuss the relationship or interaction between academia and modern
technology as consisting of a more fundamentally entangled apparatus
than [most critics of the neo-liberalisation of higher
education]{.underline}, who [see such technology as merely applied onto
academia from the 'outside' or as mere tools for use on the
'inside']{.underline} consider it to be. As an example, Ward in
Neoliberalism and the Global Restructuring of Knowledge and Education
certainly rightly claims that the digital knowledge economy, due to the
translation of information into bits and bytes, has forced a quantifi
cation of performance indicators in academia, leading to the erasure and
transformation of certain kinds of knowledge in the 'hard' as well as
the 'soft' sciences (2012, 126). Especially the humanities, says Ward,
with their forms and media of knowledge (like the monograph) that cannot
be reduced to sheer numbers, be disaggregated into sellable pieces, or
be made to follow the impetus of fast-paced output, suffer from this
quantifi cation (2012, 127). While I agree with Ward on [this aspect of
digitalisation]{.underline}, [he does not seem to consider the fact that
the origins of]{.underline} [these technologies]{.underline} as such, as
I mentioned earlier, [not only stem from university research, but also
that the supposedly empowering qualities of technologies of
communication and visualisation have in fact always been part of the
university setup from its inception]{.underline} in the late Medieval
era and the early Enlightenment in Europe---[one may here
think]{.underline}, for example, of René Descartes' mechanistic view [of
the]{.underline} material world, the [crucial importance of inventions
like the telescope and microscope, or the ways in which the
dissemination of scientific ideas relied on book printing
technology.]{.underline} It appears then that [the basic imbrication of
academia with media technologies is one of a continuous and ever-growing
constitutional yet dialectical relationship, in which these technologies
eventually turn out to be much more than simply a means through which
research and teaching are carried out. Instead, due to their
constitutive enmeshment with academia's auto-immunity, they
paradoxically expose themselves as facilitators as well as thwarters of
the academic ideal of total knowledge]{.underline}. Rather, the ideal of
exposition and omniscience, and the ways it is today carried out
[through]{.underline} modern datadriven [technologies]{.underline} and
visual media aids, [is]{.underline}, this book argues, itself [just as
ambiguous and]{.underline} finally [ungraspable]{.underline} (as their
borders likewise cannot be pinned down) as the nature of academia as
such. The book also hopes to demonstrate that in light of this[, the
central logic of the university]{.underline} today, as a logical yet
paradoxical outfl ow of the ambiguity of such techniques of exposition
and transparency, currently [consists above all in a pervasive 'stealth'
functionality or unknown quality]{.underline}. This is
[because]{.underline} especially [the cybernetic technologies that
constitute the core techniques of teaching and **research**]{.underline}
today, as I will discuss later on in this chapter, [fundamentally rely
on **obscuring their own operations**.]{.underline} This in turn segues
into the problem that [the]{.underline} contemporary [university ever
more successfully **hides its internally oppressive operations** in
favour of a false image of]{.underline} university '[objectivity'
and]{.underline} of it '[being at the forefront' of knowledge,
transparency, emancipation, and truth]{.underline}. [This 'stealth'
functionality is,]{.underline} moreover, [intimately connected to the
militaristic logic that inhabits contemporary digital
technology]{.underline}, whose implications regarding the university
this chapter will explore especially via the work of Virilio on science,
technology, and vision. Due to this stealth logic of accelerated
transparency[, a stifling 'productivist' principle]{.underline}---a term
coined by Jean Baudrillard, about whom more later too, in his The Mirror
of Production [that seeks to expose a highly ideological idea of the
human as an essentially productive or creative
agent]{.underline}---[reigns in most]{.underline} contemporary
[universities, relegating everything]{.underline} or anyone [that does
not comply with this logic as not merely undesirable but also utterly
incomprehensible,]{.underline} as some of us in the humanities or
theoretical sciences can attest to. [It is this situation that logically
gives rise to aggravated tensions]{.underline} and schizoid experiences
[among university staff and students; but it is also this situation that
fi nally allows this book to expose its hypocrisy]{.underline}. [The
irreducible unknown quality of the university, in the form of a sort of
libidinal antagonism, then pops up with a vengeance in a time where one
would least expect it. Such is the essence of managerialism after all;
guided by a principle that resides inside itself, it will only
strengthen this principle whenever it wants to banish it more
forcefully.]{.underline} Eventually then, the book proposes that the
instabilities, inconsistencies, and ambiguities generated through this
technological acceleration also present an inappropriable possibility
and a promise of a radically alternative future by way of tracing
academia's constitutive contradictions and injustices, which have led to
it becoming its own fatality. The book thus wants to make an argument
for academic writing and engagement that remains 'fatally' speculative,
enigmatic, and opaque (perhaps especially in the hard sciences), so as
to mount a polemical provocation that remains beyond the tyranny of a
total transparency feared by Virilio. This strategy---if one could call
it that---seeks to extend Baudrillard's insistence of mobilising a much
more 'fatal' radical theory in order to make a structural difference.
But before we arrive there, we must first take a closer look at how this
humanist aporia expresses itself in those texts that have theorised the
transformation of the university in recent decades and that reside
arguably closest to the 'source' of its crisis: the critical humanities.
The value of looking at such critical work in detail, besides these
works providing excellent descriptions of recent academic
transformations, resides in the fact that they deal with the crises and
paradoxes of the university also on the level of their own rhetoric, and
thus tend to explicitly display the struggles, tensions, and
contradictions at the heart of academic enquiry and writing. The
exacerbation of the university's auto-immunity can therefore, I suggest,
be conceptually, geographically, paradigmatically, and historically
located in and via these works.

#### Faith in the saving graces of the university papers over the conditions of violence that make this space possible. The only ethical act is scrambling the syntactic codes of the university through semiotic insurrection.

- there is a little death K hidden in here at the bottom

- university is probably unethical

[[Universities may serve as progressive sites of inquiry in some cases,
**yet this does not detract from the great deal of military and
corporate research**]{.mark}, economic planning and, perhaps most
importantly, social conditioning [occurring within their
walls]{.mark}]{.underline}. Furthermore, [they serve as intense machines
for the concentration of privilege]{.underline}; each university is
increasingly staffed by overworked professors and adjuncts, poorly
treated maintenance and service staff. This remains only the top of the
pyramid, since [[a hyper educated, stable society]{.mark} along Western
lines [can only exist by the intense exploitation of labor and
resources]{.mark} in the third world]{.underline}. **[[Students are
taught to be oblivious]{.underline}]{.mark}** to this fact; liberal
seminars only serve to obfuscate the fact that they are themselves
complicit in the death and destruction waged on a daily basis. They sing
the college fight song and wear hooded sweatshirts (in the case of hip
liberal arts colleges, flannel serves the same purpose). As the Berkeley
rebels observe, "[Social death is our banal acceptance of an
institution's meaning for our own lack of meaning]{.underline}."\[43\]
[[Our conception of the social is as the death of everything sociality
entails; it is the failure of communication]{.underline}]{.mark}, [the
refusal of empathy]{.underline}, the abandonment of autonomy.
Baudrillard writes that "The cemetery no longer exists because modern
cities have entirely taken over their function: they are ghost towns,
cities of death. If the great operational metropolis is the final form
of an entire culture, then, quite simply, ours is a culture of
death."\[44\] B[y attempting to excel in a university setting, we are
resigning ourselves to enrolling in]{.underline} what Mark Yudoff so
proudly calls [a cemetery]{.underline}, a necropolis to rival no other.
Yet herein lies the punch line. We are studying in the cemeteries of a
nation which has a cultural fetish for things that refuse to stay dead;
an absolute fixation with zombies. So perhaps the goal should not be to
go "Beyond Zombie Politics" at all. Writes Baudrillard: "The event
itself is counter-offensive and comes from a strange source: in every
system at its apex, at its point of perfection, it reintroduces
negativity and death."\[45\] The University, by totalizing itself and
perfecting its critiques, has spontaneously generated its own
antithesis. Some element of sociality refuses to stay within the
discourse of the social, the dead; it becomes undead, radically potent.
According to Steven Shaviro's The Cinematic Body, "zombies mark the dead
end or zero degree of capitalism's logic of endless consumption and ever
expanding accumulation, precisely because they embody this logic so
literally and to such excess."\[46\] In that sense, they are almost
identical to the mass, the silent majorities that Baudrillard describe
as the ideal form of resistance to the social: "they know that [there is
no liberation, and that [a system is abolished only by pushing it into
hyperlogic]{.mark}]{.underline}, by forcing it into excessive practice
which is equivalent to a brutal amortization."\[47\] Zombies do not
constitute a threat at first, they shamble about their environments in
an almost comic manner and are easily dispatched by a shotgun blast to
the face. Similarly, students emerge from the university in which they
have been buried, engaging in random acts of symbolic hyperconsumption
and overproduction; perhaps an overly enthusiastic usage of a classroom
or cafeteria here and there, or a particularly moving piece of
theatrical composition that is easily suppressed. "**[[Disaster is
consumed as cheesy spectacle, complete with incompetent reporting,
useless information bulletins, and inane attempts at
commentary]{.underline}]{.mark}**:"\[48\] Shaviro is talking about Night
of the Living Dead, but he might as well be referring to the press
coverage of the first California occupations. Other students respond
with horror to the encroachment of dissidents: "the living characters
are concerned less about the prospect of being killed than they are
about being swept away by mimesis -- of returning to existence, after
death, transformed into zombies themselves."\[49\] Liberal student
activists fear the incursions the most, as they are in many ways the
most invested in the fate of the contemporary university; in many ways
their role is similar to that of the survivalists in Night of the Living
Dead, or the military officers in Day. Beyond Zombie Politics claims
that defenders of the UC system are promoting a "Zombie Politics"; yet
this is difficult to fathom. For [[they are insistent on]{.mark} saving
the University, on [staying 'alive', even when their version of life has
been stripped of all that makes life worth living]{.mark}, when it is as
good as social death]{.underline}. Shaviro notes that in many scenes in
zombie films, our conceptions of protagonist and antagonist are
reversed; in many scenes, human survivors act so repugnantly that we
celebrate their infection or demise.\[50\] In reality, "Zombie Politics
are something to be championed, because they are the politics of a
multitude, an inclusive mass of political subjects, seeking to consume
brains. Yet brains must be seen as a metaphor for what Marx calls "the
General Intellect"; in his Fragment on Machines, he describes it as "the
power of knowledge, objectified."\[51\] Students and faculty have been
alienated from their labor, and, angry and zombie-like, they seek to
destroy the means of their alienation. Yet, for Shaviro, "the hardest
thing to acknowledge is that the living dead are not radically Other so
much as they serve to awaken a passion for otherness and for vertiginous
disidentification that is already latent within our own selves."\[52\]
In other words, [we have a widespread problem with aspiring to be this
other, this powerless mass]{.underline}. We seek a clear protagonist, we
cannot avoid associating with those we perceive as 'still alive'. Yet
for Baudrillard, this constitutes a fundamental flaw: \"**[[at the very
core of the \'rationality\' of our culture]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
however[, **[is an exclusion]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[that precedes
every other]{.underline}**, more radical than the exclusion of madmen,
children or inferior races, an exclusion preceding all these and serving
as their model: **[the exclusion of [the dead and of
death]{.mark}]{.underline}**.\"\[53\] In Forget Foucault, we learn the
sad reality about biopower: that [[power]{.mark} itself [is]{.mark}
fundamentally [based on the]{.mark} separation and [alienation of death
from the reality of our existence]{.mark}]{.underline}. If we are to
continue to use this conception, we risk failing to see that
[[our]{.mark} very [lives have been turned into a mechanism for
perpetuation of social death]{.mark}: the banal simulation of
existence]{.underline}. Whereas socialized death is a starting point for
Foucault, in Baudrillard and in recent actions from California, we see a
return to a reevaluation of society and of death; a possible return to
zombie politics. Baudrillard distinguishes himself as a connoisseur of
graffiti; in Forget Foucault, he quotes a piece that said "When Jesus
arose from the dead, he became a zombie."\[54\] Perhaps the reevaluation
of zombie politics will serve as the messianic shift that blasts open
the gates of hell, the cemetery-university. According to the Berkeley
kids, "when we move without return to their tired meaning, to their
tired configurations of the material, we are engaging in war."\[55\]
Baudrillard's words about [[semiotic insurrectionaries]{.mark} might
suffice]{.underline}: [\"They [blasted their way out]{.mark} however, so
as [to burst into reality like a scream]{.mark}, an interjection, an
anti-discourse, as the waste of all syntatic, poetic and political
development, as the smallest radical element that cannot be caught by
any organized discourse. Invincible due to their own poverty, [they

stadiums and office complexes. And at this critical juncture the only
way it can continue [to grow is by more intense exploitation, higher

to pass the test of 'relevancy.' [But the 'irrelevant' departments also
have their place. With their 'pure' motives of knowledge for its own

cultivates its cozy relationship with capital, war and power, **[these

#### Enshrining knowledge in the university serves only to strengthen late-capitalism's spheres of acceleration and production. 

**Hoofd 10** (Ingrid, probably would laugh at you if you asked about
quals, "Accelerated University: Activist-Academic Alliances and
Simulation thought",
<http://www.ephemerajournal.org/contribution/accelerated-university-activist-academic-alliances-and-simulation-thought>,
2010)

But far from an 'a-disciplinary self-constitution' that supposedly
overcomes any fictitious distinction, Investigacció for one relies
heavily on the common fictitious distinction between activism and
academia to validate their praxis. By contrasting their initiative to
the false objectivity of academicism, [[they validate]{.mark} their own
[knowledge production by claiming to be]{.mark} in the margins as
[opposed to the 'ivory tower', as if]{.mark} the latter is a stable area
from which [one can detach oneself from the outside world and]{.mark}
hence [objectively analyse]{.mark}]{.underline}. Also, one could wonder
to what extent one is actually speaking from the margins when one has
the time, technologies, spaces and connections to organise an event like
Investigacció. [[The desire to generate knowledge]{.mark} from 'one's
own subjectivity, without limitations']{.underline} (2005: 3) [[is
analogous to the mythical humanist narrative]{.mark} of breaking with
and improving upon previous knowledge]{.underline} -- [a form of
knowledge-innovation [that]{.mark}]{.underline} the academic institution
is also infused with. The university of excellence as well as its
doublings into projects like Investigacció [are]{.underline} therefore
[an [effect]{.mark} of]{.underline} its
**[[repetitions]{.underline}]{.mark}** (with a difference) **[[into the
neo-liberal mythical space of progress and
acceleration]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[The creation of more and more
'spaces]{.mark} and mechanisms [of]{.mark} production[, exchange and
collective reflection]{.mark}']{.underline} (2005: 3) **[[is]{.mark}
indeed precisely [what late-capitalism seeks to
forge]{.mark}]{.underline}**, as long as such reflection generates an
intensification of production. The idea that subjectivities from social
movements are in any way less produced by neo-liberal globalisation is
highly problematic. In fact, such an idea suggests a rather positivist
notion of the subject -- similar to that supposedly objective academic
individual Investigacció seeks to dethrone. Investigacció then somewhat
nostalgically narrates a subject untainted by power structures and
technologies. In fact, the Investigacció initiative displays how the
subject of activist research empowers her- or himself through recreating
the fictitious distinction between activism and academia. S/he does so
by reproducing this opposition, which in turn co-creates and accelerates
these 'new spaces' -- spaces that were created with the goal of
facilitating global capitalism and its speed-elite, and that allow for
the perfection of military power through technologies of surveillance.
[The call for participants to become active and productive in
co-organising the international event]{.underline} -- of course, without
any monetary remuneration -- is also much present in Investigacció's
rhetoric. They [suggest that participants should engage with one another
not only at the meeting, **but especially through the online
spaces**]{.underline} Investigacció has created for the purpose of
generating activist research. 'Take action!' says their flyer, '\[\...\]
make it so the conference is yours!' [This [seductive appeal to the
subject-individual]{.mark} as the centre of creative production
[is]{.mark} very [common to neo-liberal consumerism]{.mark} and its
emphasis on cybernetic interactivity]{.underline}. But i[t is also false
in that [it gives the participants a sense of
control]{.mark}]{.underline} over Investigacció **[that [they]{.mark}
actually [do not have]{.mark}]{.underline}** -- eventually, the main
organisers (have already) set the agenda and handed out the stakes. In
short, the organisers fail to situate themselves by pretending everyone
is on the same level of privilege -- for example, not requiring monetary
compensation -- in this project, and this failure is strangely an effect
of their attempt at reviving a more democratic academic structure. The
non-validity of this collective or consumer-control becomes apparent in
terms of the actual meeting and its website. This illusion of control is
also apparent in terms of the activist-academic's general influence on
subverting technocratic globalisation; counter to the common notion that
the masses dabble in individual escapism, I would argue that many
individuals worldwide are in fact more and more politically active.
Nonetheless, this activity seems less and less capable of reaching the
desired effect of countering or subverting neo-liberal globalisation.
This is, as Jean Baudrillard, whom I will discuss shortly, would have it
in 'The Implosion of Meaning in the Media', because [the desire to be
politically active is in fact increasingly a function of acceleration
under late-capitalism. [Political activity]{.mark}]{.underline} in
general [[becomes an important motor behind capitalist
circulation]{.mark},]{.underline} and the new technologies intensify
this process with their quality of instantaneity and simulation.
Investigacció thus fails to see that their [call for activist
actio]{.underline}n and their anti-academic stance implicitly [upholds a
particular theory of the politically energised subject that also
underpins speed-elitism]{.underline}. The arguments from Investigacció
that research should be done solely in the service and for the glory of
liberatory social movements, in effect puts social movement activism on
a pedestal that problematically results in a foreclosure of any critique
of complicity of such activism in acceleration. Paradoxically though, it
is this temporal foreclosure that allows for such activity -- as for a
theory of justice -- to concern itself with and perform justice as if
its praxis was 'truly liberating'. A particularly vivid example of this
strategy of foreclosure is 'Activist Research' by a group that calls
itself Glocal Research Space. This group emerged out of the Infoespai
(Infospace) project in Barcelona, which aims at empowering non-profit
organisations and social movements through mass and new media solutions.
Glocal Research Space's name already suggests a problematic conflation
of the global and the local, pointing towards an instantaneous
connection of certain places and spaces and a technological extension of
a specific sort of locality onto the global. The piece mentions that the
growing enthusiasm for social mobilisation seems to be accompanied by a
strong emergence of activist-research initiatives, in particular in
Europe and one of its favourite others, Latin America. While such an
insight might inform an analysis of how this emergence appears as a
symptom of neo-liberalism, they nonetheless propose that this emergence
is proof of a 'new form of commitment and antagonistic subjectivity'
(Glocal Research Space, 2003: 18). Moreover, they claim that social
research should be: [[Research]{.mark} that pursues the creation of a
knowledge that [is valued for its practical
effectiveness]{.mark}]{.underline} \... as opposed to an objective and
contemplative theoretical knowledge in the traditional academic fashion.
That is, a knowledge that can then be added \... to social mobilization;
[a knowledge [that generates and maximises action]{.mark}]{.underline}.
(Glocal Research Space, 2003: 18, italics mine) [The demonisation of
contemplation, and the economist urge to 'maximise action', sounds
[eerily close to the speed-elitist discourse of accelerating
production]{.mark} by seeking to obliterate any doubt, delay or
'impractical' critique that may complicate the opposition between doing
and thinking.]{.underline} I would claim that to simply maximise action
says nothing about the effects of such action, and **[the implication
that actions are automatically subversive not only repeats the fantasy
of the active subject as in control]{.underline}** of the outcome of her
actions, **[but also elides any critical reflection on the complicities
of such actions]{.underline}**. It is noteworthy also that this call for
the intensification of activity is created through an opposition to a
mythical academic space, again as if that university space is or has
ever been purely objective and theoretical. Further on in the piece,
Glocal Research Space argues that activist-research should also be
'nomadic and travelling' and that it should be conducted as 'springing
from the relation between subject-investigator and subject-investigated
\[\...\] without an object' (2003: 18). They rightly note here that
[[academic objectivity is an illusion]{.underline}]{.mark}. Nonetheless,
they go on to validate activist-research through claiming that the
people working in these projects are 'open about their motives and
opinions' (2003: 19) unlike academic researchers. They even flip the
narrative of objectivity in favour of activist-research by saying that
the latter overcomes academic institutionalisation and hence 'generates
free, public, inclusive and non-discriminatory knowledge for universal
use' (2003: 19). This statement, as well as their previous argument that
traditional academic knowledge is 'objective', effectively defeats their
previous argument that objective knowledge is a fantasy. 'Activist
Research' shows how [the call for justice]{.underline} from
Investigacció and Glocal Research Space [falls prey to universalising
its particularity by discursively repeating the action-thought dialectic
and by eventually acting as if it has overcome this aporia by aligning
itself to an ontological concept of action.]{.underline} But the
justification of action still hinges on the particular humanist
dialectic of action and thought. [Therefore, their claim unwittingly
erases how such activist-research is also always situated and limited to
its techno-economic context, meanwhile silencing any type of research or
experience that does not fit the humanist point of view.]{.underline}
This claim thus makes the (false) idea of objectivity once more the
overarching logic of social change. The idea that 'knowledges generated
by social movements' (2003: 19) can in any way be transparently read as
objective truths, as opposed to academic knowledge, not only discards
the possibility that academic practice is culturally and historically
contingent, but also employs the strategy of writing oneself into the
margins as an empowering tool that obscures the privileges that allow
such forms of empowerment. It is also interesting that 'Activist
Research' asks for 'subject-researchers' and 'subject-investigated' to
enter a 'composition process' (2003: 18), and even goes so far as to
argue that ideally, the researcher is the activist s/he investigates.
This suggested confusion of the boundary between researcher and
researched appears to complicate the traditional academic scene, though
I would argue that the indiscernible entanglement of subject and object
is today always already the case. To argue however, as Glocal Research
Space does, that subject and object should enter a composition process
presupposes that they are initially discreet entities which then
requires a sort of nomadic crossing-over. This implies again that the
activist-research nexus is a highly productive one. Likewise, the
emphasis on nomadism in, for instance, the Spanish Universidad Nómada
(Nomadic University) invokes the humanist imperative of this online
space of thought, which is really an effect of the imperative of various
forms of border-crossing for acceleration -- hence the stress on
'hybridity' and 'trans-nationalism' on its website (Universidad Nómada,
2010). The website also drums up a certain radicality of the Universidad
through images of street-activists on its homepage, which is in fact
hosted at the American company DreamHost in California. These new
dispersed and online 'spaces of thought' like Edu-Factory, Facoltà di
Fuga, Investigacció, and Glocal Research Space are therefore heavily
implicated in the continuous flow of information that neo-liberal
capital and its prime tools of colonisation require in their relentless
craving for networked overproduction. The rhetoric of overcoming the
contemporary constraints of the university from a supposed autonomous
location is itself implicated in the duplication of Bill Readings'
'university of excellence' into networked spaces through the myth of
independent thought and transparent communication. As Armitage and
Derrida suggest, thought indeed appears here as formally subsumed under
neo-liberal capital. In other words, thought is limited as well as
produced by the current horizon of techno-speed, which is itself
grounded in the humanist promise of transcendence and transparency. In
light of this, it is also no surprise that contemporary academic
obsessions in the humanities and social sciences lie with analysing or
locating subversive potential within those projects and peoples, like
those who engage in networked activism and alliance, which validate
academia's own conditions of possibility within the hegemony of speed.
But clearly, more can and should be said about the concurrent
acceleration of capital by means of humanist thought and politics --
after all, this article is itself also a symptom of the current
university's neoliberal-humanist mandate that demands that thought be
productive. If humanism today has mostly mutated into speed-elitism,
then the affirmation of acceleration also promises a change beyond
neo-liberalism. To finally raise the stakes of this circular logic of
acceleration, it is useful to turn to Jean Baudrillard's 'The Implosion
of Meaning in the Media' and 'The Final Solution' in The Vital Illusion
in which the effects of such a circular logic and its relationship to
the rhetoric of transcendence figures prominently. Initially, one could
think that Baudrillard's assessment confirms my analytical suspicion
regarding activist-research projects. In 'The Implosion', Baudrillard
starts from the premise that the increase of information in our
media-saturated society results in a loss of meaning because it
'exhausts itself in the act of staging communication'. New media
technologies exacerbate the subject's fantasy of transparent
communication, while increasingly what are communicated are mere copies
of the same, a 'recycling in the negative of the traditional
institution' (Baudrillard, 1994: 80). New technologies are simply the
materialisation of that fantasy of communication, and the 'lure' (1994:
81) of such a technocratic system resides in the requirement of active
political engagement to uphold that fantasy. This translates in a call
to subjectivise oneself -- to be vocal, participate, and to 'play the
\[\...\] liberating claim of subjecthood' (1994: 85). The result of the
intensifying circular logic of this system, he says, is that meaning not
only implodes in the media, but also that the social implodes in the
masses -- the construction of a 'hyperreal' (1994: 81). Contra the claim
of Glocal Research Space that such praxes of alliance are 'without an
object' (Glocal Research Space, 2003: 19), this does not mean that
objectification does not take place at all. Instead, and in line with
Baudrillard's argument, the urge to subjectivise oneself and the
objectification of the individual go hand in hand under speed-elitism --
a double bind that locks the individual firmly into her or his
technocratic conditions. Indeed, the argument in 'Activist Research'
that 'research \[should be\] like an effective procedure \[which is\] in
itself already a result' (2003: 19) describes the conditions of
Readings' 'university of excellence' where any research activity, thanks
to technological instantaneity, translates immediately into the
capitalist result of increased information flow (Readings, 1996: 22).
Active subjects and their others become the cybernetic objects of such a
system of information flow. The insistence in 'Activist Research' on
free, travelling and nomadic research simply makes sure that this logic
of increased flow is repeated. Because of this desire for increased flow
and connection, activist-research projects are paradoxically highly
exclusivist in advocating the discourses and tools of the speed-elite.
The problem with projects like Edu-Factory or the productive cross-over
of activism and academia is therefore not only that their political
counter-information means just more information (and loss of meaning) as
well as more capitalist production, but that it puts its faith in
precisely those technologies and fantasies of control, communication and
of 'being political' that underlie the current logic of overproduction.
It is at this point that John Armitage and Joanne Roberts in
'Chronotopia' contend that such a 'cyclical repetition' (Armitage and
Roberts, 2002: 52) is particularly dangerous because the fantasy of
control remains exactly that, a fantasy. At the same time, this
increasingly forceful repetition can only eventually give way to 'the
accident' because chronotopian speed-spaces are fundamentally and
exponentially unstable. Armitage and Roberts' idea of 'cyclical
repetition' through chronotopianism does thus not mean an exact
repetition of the speed-elite's quest for mastery -- instead, I would
argue that it is this immanent quality of difference in repetition, of
the 'essential drifting due to \[a technology's\] iterative structure
cut off from \[...\] consciousness as the authority of the last
analysis' as Derrida calls it in 'Signature Event Context' (Derrida,
1982: 316) that allows for the accident or true event to appear. The
difference through technologically sped-up repetition appears then
perhaps as a potential, but only precisely as a growing potential that
cannot be willed -- in this sense, it will be an unanticipated event
indeed. One could then speak of an intensification of politics in what
is perhaps too hastily called the neo-liberal university, opening up
unexpected spaces for critique in the face of its neo-liberalisation,
which in turn points to the fundamental instability of its enterprise.
Activist-research projects add to this intensification by virtue of
their techno-acceleration. This intensification of politics is no ground
for univocal celebration, since it remains also the hallmark of the
neo-liberal mode of production of knowledge through the new
tele-technologies as excellent, regardless of its critical content. The
current university's instability mirrors and aggravates the volatility
of a capitalism marked by non-sustainability, a growing feminisation of
poverty, the rise of a new global upper class, and highly mediated
illusions of cybernetic mastery. This nonetheless also opens up new
forms of thought, if only appearing as 'accidents'. Derrida hints at
this, but also at the university's elusiveness, in 'Mochlos, or: the
Conflict of the Faculties', when he claims that he 'would almost call
\[the university\] the child of an inseparable couple, metaphysics and
technology' (Derrida, 1993: 5, emphasis mine). Almost, but never quite
-- here then emerges the possibility of truly subversive change. But
this change will not be brought about by the mere content of the
critique, but by the way it pushes acceleration to the point of systemic
disintegration or implosion. In Fatal Strategies,
**[Baudrillard]{.underline}** calls this the '[[fatal strategy'
that]{.mark} contemporary theory must adopt]{.underline}: a sort of
[conceptual suicide attack which [aims at pulling the rug out from under
the speed-elitist mobilisation of semiotic
oppositions]{.mark}]{.underline}, and which shows the paradox behind any
attempt at structural predictions. In 'The Final Solution', Baudrillard
relates this intensification of the humanist obsession with dialectics,
mastery, and transparency -- the quest for immortality that is at the
basis of techno-scientific research -- to destruction and the death
drive through the metaphor of and actual research around cloning, which
strangely resonates well with Derrida's investigation of the
tele-technological archive in Archive Fever. I read Baudrillard's 'Final
Solution' here as a metaphor for the duplication (cloning) of thought
into virtual spaces outside the university walls proper. [If
contemporary research seeks to make human cloning possible, argues
Baudrillard, then this endeavour is equivalent to cancer: after all,
cancer is simply automatic cloning, a deadly form of
multiplication]{.underline}. It is of interest here to note that the
possibility of creating an army of clones has likewise garnered much
military interest, just as academia today more and more serves military
ends. As the logic of cloning as automatic multiplication is typical of
all current technological and humanist advancements, **[[the
exacerbation of this logic can only mean more]{.mark} promise and
[death]{.mark}]{.underline}**. At this point my argument mirrors the
apocalyptic tone of the activist-research projects. In the final
analysis, the problem with Edu-Factory, Facoltà di Fuga, Investigacció,
Universidad Nómada, Ricercatori Precari, and Glocal Research Space is
that these projects entail a very specific form of subjugation with dire
consequences for the slower and less techno-genic classes.
[Techno-scientific progress entails a regress into immortality,
epitomised by a nostalgia typical of the current socio-technical
situation, for when we were 'undivided']{.underline} (Baudrillard, 2000:
6). I contend that Baudrillard refers not only to the lifeless stage
before humans became sexed life forms, but also makes an allusion to
psycho-analytic readings of the 'subject divided in language' and its
nostalgia for wholeness and transparent communication. The desire for
immortality, like archive fever, is therefore the same as the Freudian
death drive, and [we ourselves ultimately become the object of our
technologies of scrutiny and nostalgia]{.underline}. The humanist quest
of totally transparency of oneself and of the world to oneself that
grounds the idea of the modern techno-scientific university, is
ultimately an attempt at (self-)destruction, or in any case an attempted
destruction of (one's) radical difference. The urgent political
question, which Stiegler problematically avoided in Disorientation, then
becomes: [which selves are and will become caught up in the delusion of
total self-transparency and self-justification, and which selves will be
destroyed]{.underline}? And how may we conceive of [an 'ethic of
intellectual inquiry or aesthetic contemplation']{.underline} that
'resists the imperatives of speed', as Jon Cook likewise wonders in 'The
Techno-University and the Future of Knowledge' (Cook, 1999: 323)? It is
of particular importance to note here that the very inception of this
question and its possible analysis, like the conception of the
speed-elite[, is itself again a performative repetition of the grounding
myth of the university of independent truth, justice and
reason]{.underline}. Therefore, in carrying forward the humanist
promise, this analysis is itself bound up in the intensification of the
logic of acceleration and destruction, and that is then also equally
tenuous. [[This complicity of thought in the violence of
acceleration]{.mark} itself in [turn quickens the machine of the
humanist promise]{.mark}]{.underline}, and can only manifest itself in
the prediction of a coming apocalypse -- whether it concerns a narrative
of the death of thought and the university, or of a technological
acceleration engendering the Freudian death drive. We are then simply
the next target in the technological realisation of complete γνωθι
σαυτον (know thyself) -- or so it seems. Because after all, a clone is
never an exact copy, as Baudrillard very well knows; and therefore, the
extent to which activist-research projects hopefully invite alterity can
thankfully not yet be thought.

#### The move towards authentic radical theory within the cemetery walls of the Western university merely engenders a semiotic fantasy of radicalism paving over very real conditions of violence in order to make this space possible.

capitalism's logic of endless consumption and ever expanding
accumulation, precisely because they embody this logic so literally and
to such excess]{.underline}."\[46\] In that sense, they are almost
identical to the mass, the silent majorities that Baudrillard describe
as the ideal form of resistance to the social: "[they know that [there
is no liberation]{.mark}, and that [a system is abolished only by
pushing it into hyperlogic]{.mark}, by forcing it into excessive
practice which is equivalent to a brutal
amortization]{.underline}."\[47\] [Zombies do not constitute a threat at
first, they shamble about their environments in an almost comic manner
and are easily dispatched by a shotgun blast to the face]{.underline}.
Similarly, [students emerge from the university in which they have been
buried, [engaging in]{.mark} random [acts of symbolic
hyperconsumption]{.mark} and overproduction; perhaps an overly
enthusiastic usage of a classroom or cafeteria here and there, or a
particularly moving piece of theatrical composition that is easily
suppressed]{.underline}. "Disaster is consumed as cheesy spectacle,
complete with incompetent reporting, useless information bulletins, and
inane attempts at commentary:"\[48\] Shaviro is talking about Night of
the Living Dead, but he might as well be referring to the press coverage
of the first California occupations. [Other students respond with horror
to the encroachment of dissidents: "the living characters are concerned
less about the prospect of being killed than they are about being swept
away by mimesis -- of returning to existence, after death, transformed
into zombies themselves]{.underline}."\[49\] Liberal student activists
fear the incursions the most, as they are in many ways the most invested
in the fate of the contemporary university; in many ways their role is
similar to that of the survivalists in Night of the Living Dead, or the
military officers in Day. [Beyond Zombie Politics claims that defenders
of the UC system are promoting a "Zombie Politics"; yet this is
difficult to fathom]{.underline}. For [[they are insistent on]{.mark}
saving the University, on [**staying 'alive'**, even when their version
of life has been **stripped of all that makes life worth
living**,]{.mark} when it is **as good as social death**]{.underline}.
Shaviro notes that in many scenes in zombie films, our conceptions of
protagonist and antagonist are reversed; in many scenes, human survivors
act so repugnantly that we celebrate their infection or demise.\[50\] In
reality, "[Zombie Politics are something to be championed, because they
are the politics of a multitude, an inclusive mass of political
subjects, seeking to consume brains. Yet brains must be seen as a
metaphor for]{.underline} what Marx calls "[the General
Intellect]{.underline}"; in his Fragment on Machines, he describes it as
"[the power of knowledge, objectified]{.underline}."\[51\] Students and
faculty have been alienated from their labor, and, angry and
zombie-like, they seek to destroy the means of their alienation. Yet,
for Shaviro, "[the hardest thing to acknowledge is that [the living
dead]{.mark} are **not radically Other** so much as they [**serve to
awaken a passion for otherness** and for **vertiginous
disidentification**]{.mark} that is already latent within our own
selves]{.underline}."\[52\] In other words, [we have a widespread
problem with aspiring to be this other, **this powerless
mass**]{.underline}. [We seek a **clear protagonist**, we cannot avoid
**associating** with those we perceive as 'still
**alive'**.]{.underline} Yet for Baudrillard, this constitutes a
fundamental flaw: \"[at the very core of the \'rationality\' of our
culture, however, is an exclusion that precedes every other, more
radical than the exclusion of madmen, children or inferior races, an
exclusion preceding all these and serving as their model: **the
exclusion of the dead and of death.**]{.underline}\"\[53\] In Forget
Foucault, [we learn the sad reality about biopower: that power itself is
fundamentally based on the separation and alienation of death from the
reality of our existence]{.underline}. [If we are to continue to use
this conception, we risk failing to see that [**our very lives** have
been turned into a **mechanism for perpetuation of social death**: the
banal **simulation of existence**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Whereas
socialized death is a starting point for Foucault, in Baudrillard and in
recent actions from California, [we see a return to a reevaluation of
society and of death; a possible return to zombie politics. Baudrillard
distinguishes himself as a connoisseur of graffiti]{.underline}; in
Forget Foucault, [he quotes a piece that said "When Jesus **arose from
the dead**, he became a **zombie**.]{.underline}"\[54\] [Perhaps the
reevaluation of zombie politics will serve as **the messianic shift**
that **blasts open the gates of hell**, the
**cemetery-university**]{.underline}. According to the Berkeley kids,
"when we move without return to their tired meaning, to their tired
configurations of the material, we are engaging in war."\[55\]
[[Baudrillard's]{.underline}]{.mark} words about [[semiotic
insurrectionaries]{.underline}]{.mark} might suffice: \"[They **blasted
their way out** however, so as to **burst into reality like a scream**,
an interjection, **an anti-discourse**, as the waste of all syntatic,
poetic and political development, [as **the smallest radical element**
that **cannot be caught** by any organized
discourse]{.mark}]{.underline}. Invincible due to their own poverty,
[[they **resist every interpretation**]{.mark} and **every
connotation**, [no longer denoting]{.mark} anyone or
[anything]{.mark}]{.underline}.\"\[56\]

He and his look forward to a reproduction of the logic of representative
governance, the release valve of the university plunges us into an abyss
where ideas are wisps of ether---that is, meaning is ripped from
action.  [[Let's talk about the fight endlessly]{.underline}]{.mark},
but always only [[in their managed form: to perpetually
deliberate]{.underline}]{.mark}, the endless fleshing-out-of---when we
push the boundaries of this form they are quick to reconfigure
themselves to contain us: the chancellor's congratulations, the
reopening of the libraries, the managed general assembly---there is no
fight against the administration here, only its own extension. Each day
passes in this way, the administration on the look out to shape student
discourse---it happens without pause, we don't notice nor do we care to.
It becomes banal, thoughtless.  So much so that we see we are
accumulating days: one semester, two, how close to being this or that,
how far?  This accumulation is our shared history.  This
accumulation---every once in a while interrupted, violated by a riot, a
wild protest, unforgettable fucking, the overwhelming joy of love, life
shattering heartbreak---is a muted, but desirous life.  A dead but
restless and desirous life. The university steals and homogenizes our
time yes, our bank accounts also, but it also steals and homogenizes
meaning.  [[As much as capital is invested in building a killing
apparatus abroad]{.underline}]{.mark}, an incarceration apparatus in
California, [it is]{.underline} equally [invested here]{.underline} in
an apparatus [for managing social death]{.underline}.  Social death is,
of course, simply the power source, the generator, of civic life with
its talk of reform, responsibility, unity.  A 'life,' then, which serves
merely as the public relations mechanism for death: its garrulous
slogans of freedom and democracy designed [to obscure the
shit]{.underline} and decay [in which our feet are
planted]{.underline}. Yes, [the university is a graveyard]{.underline},
but it is also a factory: a factory of meaning [which
produces]{.underline} civic life and at the same time produces [social
death]{.underline}.  [A factory which [produces]{.mark}]{.underline} the
illusion that meaning and reality can be separated; which everywhere
reproduces the empty reactionary behavior of students based on the
values of life (identity), liberty (electoral politics), and happiness
(private property).  Everywhere the same whimsical ideas of the
future. Everywhere democracy. Everywhere [[discourse to shape
our]{.underline}]{.mark} desires and [[distress in a way acceptable to
the electoral state]{.underline}]{.mark}, discourse [[designed to
make]{.underline}]{.mark} our very moments here together into [[a set
of]{.underline}]{.mark} legible and [[fruitless
demands]{.underline}]{.mark}. Totally managed death. A machine for
administering death, for the proliferation of technologies of death. As
elsewhere, things rule. Dead objects rule. In this sense, it matters
little what face one puts on the university---whether Yudof or some
other lackey. These are merely the personifications of the rule of the
dead, the pools of investments, the buildings, the flows of materials
into and out of the physical space of the university---each one the
product of some exploitation---which seek to absorb more of our work,
more tuition, more energy. The university is a machine which wants to
grow, to accumulate, to expand, to absorb more and more of the living
into its peculiar and perverse machinery: high-tech research centers,
new stadiums and office complexes. And at this critical juncture the
only way it can continue to grow is by more intense exploitation, higher
tuition, austerity measures for the departments that fail to pass the
test of 'relevancy.' But the 'irrelevant' departments also have their
place.  With their 'pure' motives of knowledge for its own sake, they
perpetuate the blind inertia of meaning ostensibly detached from its
social context.  As the university cultivates its cozy relationship with
capital, war and power, these discourses and research programs play
their own role, co-opting and containing radical potential.  And so [[we
attend lecture after lecture about how 'discourse' produces 'subjects,'
ignoring]{.underline}]{.mark} the most obvious fact [[that
we]{.underline}]{.mark} ourselves [[are produced by this discourse about
discourse which leaves us believing that it is only]{.underline}]{.mark}
words which matter, [[words about words which
matter]{.underline}]{.mark}.  [[The university gladly
permits]{.underline}]{.mark} the precautionary [[lectures
on]{.underline}]{.mark} biopower; on the production of
[[race]{.underline}]{.mark} and gender; on the reification and the
fetishization of commodities.  A taste of the poison serves well to
inoculate us against any confrontational radicalism.  And all the
[[while power weaves the invisible nets which]{.underline}]{.mark}
contain and [[neutralize all thought and action]{.underline}]{.mark},
that bind revolution inside books, lecture halls.

### Anti-Blackness (Kinda-ish?)

#### There is a recrimination DA -- the attempt to redeem all history merely re-sutures the coherence of an empowered humanitarian cogito bent on humanitarian salvation. You should keep it on the books and refuse attempts at attonment as these pave the way for neocolonialism wars of human rights for the suffering other even if radical in content -- this outweighs and turns their alternative on the level of practice: you *are* what you critique.

**Baudrillard 03.** Jean Baudrillard, Fragments, 106-111

On the necessity of Evil and Hell There is no longer any irrevocable
damnation today. There is no longer any hell. We may concede that we are
still within the mongrel concept of Purgatory, but virtually everything
falls within the scope of redemption. It is clearly from such an
evangelism that all the manifest, promotional signs of well-being and
fulfilment derive that are offered us by a paradisaical society subject
to the Eleventh Commandment (\'Be happy and give all the signs of
contentment!\') - the one that cancels out all others. But we can also
read [[this demand for salvation and]{.mark} universal [atonement in the
way that not only all current violence and injustices, but also,
retrospectively, all the crimes]{.mark} and contradictory events [of the
past are now coming in for condemnation]{.mark}.]{.underline} The French
[[Revolution]{.underline}]{.mark} is put in the dock [and
[slavery]{.mark} is condemned]{.underline}, along with original sin and
battered [[wives]{.underline}]{.mark}, [the [ozone]{.mark}]{.underline}
layer [and sexual harassment]{.underline}. In short, [the pre-trial
investigation for the Last Judgement is well under way. [We are
**condemning, then pardoning and whitewashing,** our entire
history]{.mark}, exterminating the Evil from even the tiniest crevices
in order to present the image of a radiant universe]{.underline}, ready
to pass into the next world. A gigantic undertaking. One that is
inhuman, superhuman, too human? As Stanislaw Lee says, \'We no doubt
have too anthropomorphic a view of man.\' And **[[why feed this eternal
repentance factory]{.underline}]{.mark}**, this chain reaction [of bad
conscience?]{.underline} Because [[everything has to be saved.]{.mark}
This is what we have come to today: [everything will be
redeemed]{.mark}, the entire past will be rehabilitated, polished to the
point of transparency]{.underline}. As for the future, there\'s even
better in store, and even worse: everything will be genetically modified
to achieve biological perfection and the democratic perfection of the
species. Salvation, which was defined by the equivalence of merit and
grace, will, once the abscess of evil and hell has been drained, be
defined by the equivalence between genes and performance. Actually, once
happiness becomes purely and simply the general equivalent of salvation,
there is no further reason for heaven. No heaven without hell, no light
without darkness. No one can be saved if no one is damned (by
definition, but we also know this intuitively: where would the elect
find pleasure, except in the contemplation of God, were it not for the
spectacle of the damned and their torment?). And once everyone is
virtually saved, no one is. Salvation no longer has any meaning. This is
the fate in store for our democratic enterprise: it is vitiated from the
outset by the neglect of necessary discrimination, by the omission of
evil. We therefore need an irrevocable presence of Evil, an Evil with no
possible redemption, a definitive discrimination, a perpetual duality of
Heaven and Hell, and even in a way a predestination to Evil, for no
destiny can be without some predestination. There is nothing immoral in
this. By the rules of the game there is nothing immoral in some losing
and others winning, nor even in everyone losing. What would be immoral
would be for everyone to win. Now, this is the contemporary ideal of our
democracy: that everyone be saved. And this is possible only at the cost
of a perpetual upping of the stakes, of endless inflation and
speculation, since ultimately happiness is not so much an ideal
relationship to the world as a rivalry with, and a victorious relation
to, others. And this is good: it means that the hegemony of Good, of the
individual state of grace, will always be thwarted by some challenge or
passion, and that any kind of happiness, any kind of ecstatic state, can
be sacrificed to something more vital, which may be of the order of the
will, as Schopenhauer has it, or of power, or of the will to power in
Nietzsche\'s conception, but something which, in any event, is of the
order of Evil, of which there is no definition, but which may be summed
up as follows: that which, against any happy intended purpose
\[destination heureuse}, is predestined to come to pass. Beneath its
euphoric exaltation, this imperative of optimum performance, of ideal
achievement, certainly bears evil and misfortune within it, then, in the
form of a profound disavowal of such fine prospects, in the form of a
secret, anticipated disillusion ment. Perhaps [even [this is]{.mark}
again just [a collective form of sacrifice]{.mark}]{.underline} - [a
human sacrifice, but a disembodied one,]{.underline} [[distilled into
**homeopathic doses**]{.underline}.]{.mark} [Wherever humans are
condemned to total freedom or to ideal fulfilmen]{.underline}t[, this
subversion seeps in]{.underline} - this automatic abreaction to their
own good and their own happiness. When they are ordered to get the
maximum efficiency and pleasure out of themselves, they remain out of
sorts and live a split existence. In this strange world, where
everything is potentially available (the body, sex, space, money,
pleasure) to be taken or rejected en bloc, everything is there; nothing
has disappeared physically, but everything has disappeared
metaphysically. \'As if by magic or enchantment\', you might say. Only
the fact is, it is more by disenchantment. Individuals, such as they
are, are becoming exactly what they are. With no transcendence and no
image, they pursue their lives like a function that is useless in
respect of another world, irrelevant even in their own eyes. And they do
what they do all the better for the fact that there is no other
possibility. No instance, no essence, no personal substance worthy of
singular expression. [[They have sacrificed their lives to their
functional existences]{.underline}.]{.mark} They coincide with [the
exact]{.underline} numerical [calculation of]{.underline} their
[lives]{.underline} and their performances. [An existence
fulfilled]{.underline}, then, [but one at the same time denied,
thwarted, disavowed]{.underline}. The culmination of a whole negative
counter-transference. This imperative of optimum performance at the same
time comes into internal contradiction with the democratic moral law
which ordains that everyone be perpetually re-set to equality and
everything re-set to zero, on the pretext of democracy and an equal
sharing of opportunity and advantage. Given the prospect of salvation
for all and universal redemption, no one has the right to distinguish
himself, no one has the right to captivate \[siduire[}. [For justice to
be done, all privilege must disappear]{.mark}; it is for all to rid
themselves voluntarily of any specific qualities]{.underline}, to become
once again an elementary particle2 - collective happiness, [[based on
levelling down and repentance]{.mark}, leading to the coming of the
lowest common denominator and basic banalities]{.underline}. This is
like a reverse potlatch, with [everyone outdoing each other in
minimalism and victimhoo]{.underline}d, while fiercely cultivating their
tiniest differences and cobbling together their multiple identities.
[Repentance and recrimination are all part of the same
movement]{.underline}: recrimination means going back over the crime to
correct its course and effects. [[This is what we are doing in going
back over the whole of our history]{.mark}, over the criminal history of
the human race, [to do penance here and now as we await the Last
Judgement]{.mark}.]{.underline} For [God is dead, but his judgement
remains]{.underline}. Which explains the immense syndrome of
resipiscence and (historical) rewriting (with the future genetic and
biological rewriting of the species still to come) that has seized the
twentieth century\'s end; with an eye, as ever, to deserving salvation
and - with the prospect of the final accounting before us - to
presenting the image of an ideal victim. Naturally, we are not speaking
of a real trial or of genuine repentance. [It is a matter of fully
enjoying the spectacle of one\'s own misfortune]{.underline}: \'Mankind,
which in Homer\'s time was an object of contemplation for the Olympian
gods, now is one for itself. Its self-alienation has reached such a
degree that it can experience its own destruction as an aesthetic
pleasure of the first order\' (Walter Benjamin).3 This is but the latest
episode in a heart-rending process of revisionism - running down not
just the history of the twentieth century, but all the violent events of
past centuries, to subject them to the new jurisdiction of human rights
and crimes against humanity (just as every action today is subjected to
the jurisdiction of sexual, moral or political harassment). As part of
the same trend by which all works of art (including the human genome)
are listed as world heritage sites, [everything is put on the list of
crimes against humanity]{.underline}. The latest episode, then, of this
revisionist madness has been the proposal to condemn slavery and the
slave trade as crimes against humanity. [[An absurd proposal to rectify
the past in terms of our Western humanitarian
consciousness]{.underline}]{.mark} or, in other words, [in terms of our
own criteria, [in the purest traditions of colonialism.]{.mark} This
imperialism of repentance really is the limit!]{.underline} The idea is,
in fact, to enable the \'peoples concerned\' to put this tragedy behind
them thanks to this official condemnation and, [[once their rights have
been restored]{.mark} and they have been recognized [and celebrated as
victims, to complete their work of mourning]{.mark} and draw a line
under this page of their history in order [to become full participants
in]{.mark} the course of [modernity]{.mark}]{.underline}. It might be
seen, then, as a kind of successful psychoanalysis. [Perhaps the
Africans will even be able to translate this moral acknowledgement into
damage claims]{.underline}, using the same monstrous measure of
equivalence from which the survivors of the Shoah have been able to
benefit. [So [we shall go on compensating]{.mark}, atoning and
rehabilitating [ad infinitum, and we shall merely have added to raw
exploitation]{.mark} the hypocritical absolution of mourning; we shall
merely, by compassion, have transformed evil into
misfortune.]{.underline} From the standpoint of our [recycled humanism,
the whole of history is pure crime]{.underline} - and, indeed, without
all these crimes there quite simply would be no history: [\'If we
eliminated the evil in man,]{.underline}\' wrote Montaigne, [\'we would
destroy the fundamental conditions of life]{.underline}.\' But, on this
basis, Cain killing Abel is already a crime against humanity - and
almost a genocide (there were only two of them!), and isn\'t original
sin already a crime against humanity? [All this is absurd, all this
humanitarian, retrospective fakery is absurd]{.underline}. And it all
stems from the confusion between evil and misfortune. Evil is the world
as it is and as it has been, and one may look upon this with lucidity.
[Misfortune is the world]{.underline} as it never should have been - but
in the name of what? - in [the name of what should be,]{.underline} in
the name of God or a transcendent ideal, of a Good it would be difficult
indeed to define. We may take a criminal view of crime - that is the
tragic view - or we may take [a recriminatory view - and that is the
humanitarian view, the pathos-laden, sentimental view, the view which
constantly calls for reparation]{.underline}. [[We have here all the
ressentiment dredged up from the depths of a genealogy of
morals]{.mark}, and [requiring in us reparation for our own
lives.]{.mark} This retrospective compassion, [this conversion of evil
into misfortune is the]{.mark} twentieth century\'s [most flourishing
industry]{.mark}]{.underline}. First as [[a mental blackmailing
operation]{.mark}, to which we all fall victim]{.underline}, even in our
actions, from which we can now hope only for the lesser evil (keep a low
profile, do everything in such a way as anyone else could have done it -
decriminalize your existence!). [Then as a profitable operation with
gigantic yields, since [misfortune]{.mark}]{.underline} (in all its
forms: from suffering to insecurity, oppression to depression)
[[represents a symbolic capital, the exploitation of
which]{.underline}]{.mark} - even more than the exploitation of
happiness [- [is endlessly profitable]{.underline}]{.mark} [from the
economic standpoint]{.underline}. It\'s a gold-mine, as they say, and
there is an inexhaustible source of ore, because the seam lies within
each of us. Misfortune commands the highest prices, whereas evil cannot
be traded. It is impossible to exchange. [To transcribe evil into
misfortune and then to transcribe misfortune into commercial, or
spectacular, value - most often with the collusion or assent of the
victim himself. But the victim\'s collusion with his own misfortune is
part of the ironic essence of Evil. It is what brings it about that no
one wants his own good, and nothing is for the best in the best of all
worlds]{.underline}

#### Commodification -- Only our AFF's deconstruction of difference fetishism on the level of language avoids re-absorption.

[This is [theory's acute dilemma]{.mark}: [that desire expresses
itself]{.mark} most fully [where only those absorbed in its
delights]{.mark} and torments [are present]{.mark}, that it triumphs
most completely over other human preoccupations in places sheltered from
view]{.underline}. Thus [it is **paradoxically in hiding** that the
secrets of desire come to light]{.underline}, th[at hegemonic
impositions and their reversals, evasions, and subversions are at their
most honest and active, and that the identities and disjunctures between
felt passion and established culture place themselves on **most vivid
display**]{.underline}. -- Joan Cocks, The Oppositional Imagination
[[Within]{.mark} current [debates about race]{.mark} and difference,
mass culture is the contemporary location that both publicly declares
and perpetuates the idea that **[there is pleasure to be found in
the]{.mark} acknowledgment and [enjoyment of racial
difference]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[The **commodiﬁcation of Otherness**
has been **so successful**]{.mark} because [it is offered as **a new
delight**]{.mark}, more intense, **more satisfying than normal ways of
doing and feeling**]{.underline}. [Within commodity culture,
**[ethnicity becomes spice]{.mark}**, seasoning that can **liven up the
dull dish** that is mainstream white culture]{.underline}. [Cultural
[taboos]{.mark} around sexuality and desire [are transgressed]{.mark}
and made explicit as **[the media bombards folks with a message of
difference]{.mark}** no longer based on the white supremacist assumption
that "blondes have more fun]{.underline}." [The "real fun" is to be had
by bringing to the surface all those "nasty" unconscious fantasies and
longings about contact with the Other embedded in **the secret (not so
secret) deep structure of white supremacy**]{.underline}. In many ways
it is a contemporary revival of interest in the "primitive," with a
distinctly postmodern slant. As Marianna Torgovnick argues inGone
Primitive: Savage Intellects, Modern Lives: [What is clear now is that
[**the West's fascination with the primitive** has to do with **its own
crises in identity**]{.mark}, with its own need to clearly demarcate
subject and object even while ﬂirting with other ways of experiencing
the universe]{.underline}. [Certainly from the standpoint of white
supremacist capitalist patriarchy, the hope is that desires for the
"primitive" or [fantasies about the Other]{.mark} can be continually
exploited, and that such exploitation will occur in a manner that
**reinscribes and [maintains the status
quo]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Whether or not desire for contact
with the Other, for connection rooted in the longing for pleasure, can
act as a critical intervention challenging and subverting racist
domination, inviting and enabling critical resistance, is an unrealized
political possibility. [[Exploring how desire for the Other is]{.mark}
expressed, [manipulated]{.mark}, and transformed by encounters with
difference and the different [is **a critical terrain**]{.mark} that
**can indicate whether these potentially revolutionary longings are ever
fulfilled**]{.underline}. [Contemporary]{.underline} working-class
British [slang playfully converges the discourse of desire, sexuality,
and the Other, evoking the phrase getting "a bit of the Other" as a way
to speak about sexual encounter]{.underline}. Fucking is the Other.
[Displacing the notion of Otherness from race, ethnicity, skin-color,
the body emerges as a site of contestation where sexuality is the
metaphoric Other that threatens to take over, consume, transform via the
experience of pleasure]{.underline}. [Desired and sought after, sexual
pleasure alters the consenting subject, deconstructing notions of will,
control, coercive domination]{.underline}. [[Commodity culture]{.mark}
in the United States **[exploits conventional thinking about
race]{.mark}, gender, and sexual desire** by "working" both the idea
that racial difference marks one as Other and the assumption that sexual
agency expressed within the context of racialized sexual encounter is [a
**conversion experience** that **alters one's place and
participation**]{.mark} in contemporary cultural politics]{.underline}.
**[[The seductive promise]{.mark} of this encounter is that it will
counter the terrorizing force of the status quo that makes identity
ﬁxed, static, a condition of containment and death]{.underline}**. And
[that it is this willingness to transgress racial boundaries within the
realm of the sexual that **[eradicates the fear]{.mark} that [one must
always conform to the norm to remain "safe]{.mark}."**]{.underline}
**[Difference can seduce precisely because the mainstream imposition of
sameness is a provocation that terrorizes]{.underline}**. And
[as]{.underline} Jean [Baudrillard suggests]{.underline} in Fatal
Strategies: **[[Provocation]{.mark} -- [unlike seduction, which allows
things to come into play]{.mark} and appear in secret, dual and
ambiguous [-- does not leave you free to be]{.mark}; it [calls]{.mark}
on you [to reveal yourself as you are]{.mark}. [It is always blackmail
by identity]{.mark} (and thus [a symbolic murder]{.mark}, since you are
never that, except precisely by being condemned to it).]{.underline}**

#### Semiotic Mediation DA -- Their focus on the damaged black body to be rehabilitated ignores that beyond Fanon's 'Look a Black' towards 'Look, I Overcame' wherein narratives of oppressed overcoming function as semiotic capital to grease the wheels of racial neoliberalism.

**[[Resilience must be performed]{.mark} explicitly, legibly, and
spectacularly]{.underline}**. [[Overcoming is **necessary, but
insufficient**]{.underline}]{.mark}; [to count and function as
resilience, this [overcoming must be]{.mark} **accomplished in a
[visible]{.mark} or otherwise legible [and consumable]{.mark}
manner**]{.underline}. [[Overcoming is a type of \"affective
labor]{.underline}\" [which]{.underline}]{.mark}, as Steven Shaviro puts
it, \"[[is productive]{.mark} only [to the extent that it is a
public]{.mark} [performance]{.mark}]{.underline}, **[it cannot unfold in
the hidden depths]{.underline}**; **[it must be visible and
audible]{.underline}**\" (PCA 49n33). In order to tune into feminine
resilience and feed it back into its power supply, MRWaSP has to
perceive it as such. \"**[[Look, I Overcame!\" is the resilient
subject\'s maxim]{.mark} or mantra]{.underline}**. [**Gender** and
**race** have always been **\"visible identities**]{.underline},\" to
use philosopher Linda Martin Alcoff\'s term, [identities strongly tied
to one\'s **outward physical appearance**]{.underline}. However,
[**gendered/ racialized resilience isn\'t visible** in the **same way**
that **conventional gender and racial identities** are
visible]{.underline}. To clarify these differences, **[it\'s helpful to
think of resilience in terms of a \"Look, I Overcame!\"
imperative]{.underline}**. \"**[Look, I Overcame!\" is easy to juxtapose
to Frantz Fanon\'s \"Look, a Negro]{.underline}**!\", which is [the
touchstone for his analysis of gendered racialization]{.underline} in
\"The Fact of Blackness.\" [In both cases, looking is a means of
crafting race/gender identities and distributing white patriarchal
privilege]{.underline}. **[But, in the same way that resilience
discourse \"upgrades\" traditional methods for crafting identities and
distributing privilege, the \"looking\" in \"Look, I Overcame!\" is an
upgrade on the \"looking\" in \"Look, a Negro]{.underline}**!\"
[[According to Fanon]{.mark}, the exclamation \"Look, a Negro!\"
racializes him as a black man. **To be \"a Negro\" is to be objectified
by [the white supremacist gaze]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [**This gaze
[fixes him as an object]{.mark}**, rather than an ambiguous
transcendence (which is a more nuanced way of describing the
existentialist concept of subjectivity]{.underline}). \"[The black
man]{.underline},\" as Fanon argues, \"**[has no ontological resistance
for the white man]{.underline}**\" (BSWM 110) because, [as an object and
not a mutually-recognized subject, he cannot return the white man\'s
gaze (\"The Look\" that is so important to Sartre\'s theory of
subjectivity]{.underline} in Being & Nothingness). [The LIO narrative
differs from Fanon\'s account in the same way it differs from Iris
Young\'s account of feminine body comportment: **[in resilience
discourse, objectification isn\'t an end but a
means]{.mark}**]{.underline}[. **[Any impediment posed
by]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[the [damage]{.mark} wrought by the
white/male gaze [is a necessary prerequisite for subjectivity, agency,
and mutual recognition]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In other words, **[[being
looked at isn\'t an impediment, but a resource.]{.mark}
[Resilience]{.mark} discourse [turns objectification]{.mark} (being
looked at) [into a means of subjectification
(overcoming]{.mark}).]{.underline}** [It]{.underline} also **[makes
looking even [more]{.mark} efficient and [profitable than simple
objectification could ever be]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}
[**Recognizing and [affirming the affective]{.mark} [labor of the
resilient performer]{.mark}**[, the spectator **feeds the
performer\'s**]{.mark} **individual [overcoming into a
s]{.mark}econd-order [therapeutic]{.mark}
[narrative]{.mark}**]{.underline}[: [our approbation of her
overcoming]{.underline}]{.mark} [is [evidence]{.mark} [of our own
overcoming]{.mark} of our [past prejudices]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [This
spectator]{.underline}]{.mark} [**[wants to be seen]{.mark} by a wider
audience** [as **someone** who **answers**]{.mark} **the resilient
feminine subject\'s hail, \"Look, I Overcame!\".**]{.underline} [Just as
individual feminine [subjects use their resilience as proof of their own
goodness]{.mark}, MRWaSP uses the resilience of its \"good girls\" **as
proof that they\'re the \"good guys**]{.underline}\"---that [its social
and ethical practices are **truly just**]{.underline}, and that [we
really mean it this time when we say everyone is equal]{.underline}. For
example, [[the \"resilience\" of \"our\" women is]{.mark} often
[contrasted with the]{.mark} supposed \"[fragility\" of Third-World
women of color]{.mark}]{.underline}. Or, [in domestic US race-gender
politics, [the resilience of some African]{.mark}-[American
women]{.mark} (their bootstraps-style class ascendance) is [contrasted
to the]{.mark} continued [fragility of other]{.mark} African-American
[women, and]{.mark}]{.underline} thus [[used to reinforce class
distinctions]{.mark} among blacks]{.underline}. There are a million
different versions of this general story: \"our\" women are already
liberated---they saved themselves---but, to riff on Gayatri Spivak,
\"[[brown women need saving from brown men]{.underline}]{.mark}.\" [Most
mainstream conversations about Third-World women are versions of this
story: [discussions of \"Muslim\" veiling]{.mark}, female circumcision,
[sweatshops, poverty, \"development,\" they\'re all white-saviorist
narratives meant to display]{.mark} MRWaSP\'s own [resilience]{.mark}.
**[Look, I Overcame!\" upgrades \"Look, a Negro!\" by]{.mark} (a)
[recycling objectification into overcoming]{.mark}**]{.underline} .and
(**[b) compounding looking, [so that one can profit from others\'
resilience, treating their overcoming as one\'s own
overcoming]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [This upgrade in white supremacist
patriarchy requires a **concomitant upgrade in
\"looking**]{.underline}.\" This shift in looking practices parallels
developments in film and media aesthetics. As Steven Shaviro has argued,
[the values, techniques, and compositional strategies most common in
contemporary mainstream Western cinema]{.underline}---like Michael
Bay\'s Transformers---[are significantly different than the ones used in
modernist and post-modernist cinema]{.underline}, and that **[these
differences in media production correlate to broader shifts in the means
of capitalist and ideological production]{.underline}**.
**[Neoliberalism\'s aesthetic is]{.underline}**, he argues,
\"**[post-cinematic]{.underline}**.\" [This post-cinematic aesthetic
applies not just to film and media, but to **resilience
discourse**]{.underline}. [Its performance practices and looking
relations configured by the \"Look, I Overcame!\" imperative, resilience
is]{.underline}, in a way, **[another type of post-cinematic
medium]{.underline}**. In the next section I use Shaviro\'s theory of
post-cinematic media to identify some specific ways in which
[traditional patriarchal tools are updated to work compatibly with
MRWaSP resilience discourse]{.underline}. [The looking in the \"Look, I
Overcame!\" narrative is not the same kind of looking described by
concepts like \"the male gaze\" or \"controlling images.\" This looking
is a type of **deregulated MRWaSP visualization**]{.underline}.

#### Participation DA -- The FORM of their argument -- its objective diagnosis, penchant for positivist historical analysis, its will to truth -- guarantees that they legitimate policy debate as an allegedly radical safety valve for the insulation of the liberal civil society they criticize. They maintain the semiotic fantasy of liberation in this activity while alienating the very real material exploitation necessary to make this space possible.

Th[ere exist causes from whose nature some effect does not
follow]{.underline}. There exist causes that preempt their own effects
from coming to be. In an early text from 1969, "Play and the Police,"
[Baudrillard]{.underline} (2001a) [speaks of a "**principle of
separation**]{.underline}." [This principle is how he rethinks
repression not through the notions of negation, aggression, or vital
forces being blocked but through the concepts of ambiance, integration,
and participation]{.underline}. **[The "unity of desire" is
broken]{.underline}**, he suggests, [into a **never ending series** of
private-sphere negotiations]{.underline}. [The question becomes **Am I
liberated? not Are we?**]{.underline} "[The separative cause, which
bursts through the unity of desire and establishes human activity across
several zones . . . is most effective at neutralizing
energies]{.underline}" (Baudrillard, 2001a, pp. 18-19). Thus, [in what
Deleuze would describe later as **the distinction between discipline and
control**, [Baudrillard]{.mark} here [posits]{.mark} a model of
**[repression through expression]{.mark}**, a [**stunting of the
drives** through the very **facilitation of those drives into new
control spaces**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [A **new ambiance permeates the
social field**]{.underline}. Th**[e masses are not repressed, no never,
they are allowed to dream]{.underline}**! [With]{.underline} reference
to Marcuse's concept of "[repressive desublimation,"
Baudrillard]{.underline} (2001a) [calls this "**the repression of desire
. . . through the emancipation of needs**]{.underline}" (p. 20). Again,
"**[[they did it, but we wanted it]{.underline}]{.mark}**." [The
separative cause [reveals how **ideology and reification operate under
neoliberalism**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Summarize it like this:
[**Exploitation is material, liberation is semiotic**. The material is
the realm of **political failure**]{.underline}; [the social is the
realm of **utopian compromise**]{.underline}. In Baudrillard, [the
principle of separation is the principle by which the two are segregated
and divided into two distinct domains, **[the one to play the fool for
the other]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The separative cause has two steps.
[To achieve some semblance of pedagogical coherence, I will telescope
them into a cause-and-effect narrative, but to be precise, Step 1 and
Step 2 both **happened at the same time**. **In Step 1**, the given
phenomenon, which exists primordially as an undivided prob- lematic
containing both progressive and reactionary political impulses, is first
separated into (a) a material modality and (b) a social
modality]{.underline}. For example, [with global warming, there is **the
material modality of carbon dioxide emissions**, automobiles and roads,
the oil industry, and so on, while at the same time there is **the
symbolic social modality of desiring clean air, "thinking green," and
the so-called awareness campaigns**]{.underline}. [The principle of
separation occasions the phenomenon first **through an alliance formed
between the progressive political impulse** and **the domain of the
social or public sphere**]{.underline}. [[A progressive moral
horizon]{.mark} of significant magnitude **invests itself in the social
sphere**]{.underline}. [This moral plane develops its own independent
logic and [will]{.mark} likely [experience **a** ]{.mark}**flourishing
[cycle of achievement and]{.mark} resolution** but **[always within the
"symbolic"]{.mark} realm [of the social]{.mark} or public
sphere**]{.underline}. **[From time to time, [small material
changes]{.mark} may be incorporated into the logic of moral resolution
[but only those minor enough not to impinge upon the superiority of the
social.]{.mark} In Step 2, [the progressive]{.mark} political impulse
[is negated]{.mark} and as negation finds its home in the domain of the
material]{.underline}**. Thus [**a [reactionary political project
blossoms]{.mark}** []{.mark}within the realm of the physical [world.
This project **realizes its ends, developing the necessary mechanisms
and infrastructures required to continue and
grow**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In Baudrillard, **[the separative cause is
this overall structure]{.underline}**. [What the separative cause
occasions, or "makes present," is the ability for **both gratuitous
exploitation and a heightened moral instinct to coexist within the same
universe**]{.underline}. It is perhaps seen best in Baudrillard's
controversial critique of sexual liberation in Part 1 of Seduction. [A
structure of both liberation and deferral, of dazzlement and insight, of
both ignorance and realization, of both expression and silence---**[all
sides unify together]{.mark} but only at the cost of a complete and
incontrovertible segregation between the symbolic and the
material**]{.underline}. [**[The progressive
stance]{.underline}**]{.mark} of the one [**[allows for the reactionary
stance of the other]{.underline}**. [The **end result is the current
state of affairs**]{.underline}]{.mark}[: [an **oil company that is**
]{.mark}**nevertheless ["green,"]{.mark}** [a world **bathed in blood
but devoted to peace**]{.mark}, a global consumer product that is still
tagged "fair trade." The separative cause occasions]{.underline}. But it
[occasions a "presence," a presence that must be crossed out or held in
suspension with quotation marks]{.underline}. [The presence occasioned
by **the separative cause is in fact an abatement of presence**, a
**lessening of being**. What it makes present is a structure of
suspension. A "subject" is the name given to those entities able to
flourish within such a structure of suspension.]{.underline} As
Baudrillard was able to see, **[most all phenomena in contemporary life
are occasioned through this "separative cause" or principle of
separation]{.underline}**. [The **environmental movement** is a perfect
example. In today's world, it is structurally impractical if not
**outright impossible to be an environmentalist in any true
sense**]{.underline}. [Imagine: [An activist drives to a rally against
global warming]{.mark}. The contradiction is clear. His actual spiritual
liberation is undercut by the tailpipe fumes of his own expression.
**His [intentions are good]{.mark}, but [there is a physical base---that
depraved automobile contraption---that creates conditions of
impossibility that are symbolically if not practically
insurmountable]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Of course, **[many today refuse
to participate in the global system of environmental exploita- tion by
casting off all worldly possessions]{.underline}**. But [this comes at
the cost of complete withdrawal from the world system, a price too high
to pay for most]{.underline}. [**[Like the computer at the heart
of]{.mark} today's [planetary organization, the costs are]{.mark} thus
[binary]{.mark} in that [they offer an all-or-nothing option, but only
an "option" insofar as the nothing is reified into material reality and
the all spins on into oblivion. This is how the separative cause
operates.]{.mark}** Other examples include the curious and no doubt
tense axis of inaction forged between the United Nations and American
foreign policy after the new millennium on issues such as Darfur peace:
**[the symbolic assertion]{.mark} on the side of the United States that,
in no uncertain terms, "[this is genocide]{.mark}**," [flanked only by
**a negation of that same claim in abandonment and blindness** within
the realm of real material commitment]{.mark}]{.underline}. Or [consider
the structural adjustment agreements of the I]{.underline}nternational
[M]{.underline}onetary [F]{.underline}und, [which travel on wings of
hope to the so-called backward economies of the globe but carry enclosed
the harshest austerity measures]{.underline}, **[leaving the infected
country with a curse of legalized deterritorialization and fiscal and
cultural subjugation for decades to come]{.underline}**. **[Exploitation
is material, liberation is semiotic]{.underline}**. [This is how the
separative cause occasions, or brings to presence, **certain phenomena
in today's global kingdom**]{.underline}. **[The democratization of Iraq
is realizable only through subjugation; clean air is realizable only
through a futures market in "pollution credits"---and around and
around]{.underline}**. **[Might this separative cause be also known by a
synonym twin, "civilization"? In Baudrillard, [the term was simply the
real. It occasions real human worlds by allowing them to come to
be]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

#### Use of suffering to advance a political agenda objectifies the oppressed and is a prophylactic preventing action

**Berlant 98** (Lauren -- George M. Pullman Distinguished Service
Professor of English at the University of Chicago, Ph.D. from Cornell
University, "Poor Eliza," in American Literature, Volume 70, Number 3,
p. 635-668,
<http://www2.law.columbia.edu/faculty_franke/Gay_Marriage/Poor%20Eliza.pdf>)

What distinguishes these critical texts are the startling ways they
struggle to encounter the Uncle Tom form without reproducing it,
declining to pay the inheritance tax. The postsentimental does not
involve an aesthetic disruption to the contract sentimentality makes
between its texts and readers -that proper reading will lead to better
feeling and therefore to a better self. What changes is the place of
repetition in this contract, a crisis frequently thematized in formal
aesthetic and generational terms. [In its traditional and political
modalities, the sentimental promises that in a just world a consensus
will already exist about what constitutes uplift, amelioration, and
emancipation, those horizons toward which empathy powerfully directs
itself.]{.underline} [Identification with suffering, the ethical
response to the sentimental plot, leads to its repetition in the
audience and thus to a [generally held ]{.mark}]{.underline}[view about
what transformations would bring the good life into being]{.mark}[. This
presumption]{.underline}, that the terms of consent are transhistorical
once true feeling is shared, [[explains]{.underline}]{.mark} in part
[[why]{.mark} [emotions]{.mark}, especially painful ones, [are so
central to the world-building aspects of sentimental
alliance]{.mark}.]{.underline} Postsentimental texts withdraw from the
contract that presumes consent to the conventionally desired outcomes of
identification and empathy. [The desire for unconflictedness might very
well motivate the sacrifice of surprising ideas to the norms of the
world against which this rhetoric is being deployed.]{.underline} What,
if anything, then, can be built from the very different
knowledge/experience of subaltern pain? What can memory do to create
conditions for freedom and justice without reconfirming the terms of
ordinary subordination? More than a critique of feeling as such, [the
postsentimental modality]{.underline} also [challenges what]{.underline}
literature and [storytelling have come to stand for in the creation of
sentimental national subjects]{.underline} across an almost two-century
span. Three moments in this genealogy, which differ as much from each
other as from the credulous citation of Uncle Tom\'s Cabin we saw in The
King and I and Dimples, will mark here some potential within the arsenal
that counters the repetition compulsions of sentimentality. This essay
began with a famous passage from James Baldwin\'s \"Everybody\'s Protest
Novel,\" a much-cited essay about Uncle Tom\'s Cabin that is rarely read
in the strong sense because its powerful language of rageful
truth-telling would shame in advance any desire to make claims for the
tactical efficacy of suffering and mourning in the struggle to transform
the United States into a postracist nation. I cited Baldwin\'s text to
open this piece not to endorse its absolute truth but to figure its
frustrated opposition to the sentimental optimism that equates the
formal achievement of empathy on a mass scale with the general project
of democracy. Baldwin\'s special contribution to what sentimentality can
mean has been lost in the social-problem machinery of mass society, in
which [[the production of tears]{.mark} where anger or nothing might
have been became more urgent with the coming to cultural dominance of
the Holocaust and]{.underline} [trauma as models for having and
remembering collective social experience]{.mark}.20 Currently, as [in
traditional sentimentality, the authenticity of overwhelming pain that
can be textually performed and shared is disseminated as a]{.underline}
prophylactic [against the reproduction of a shocking and numbing mass
violence]{.underline}. Baldwin asserts that [the overvaluation of such
redemptive feeling is precisely a condition of that
violence]{.underline}**.** Baldwin\'s encounter with Stowe in this essay
comes amidst a general wave of protest novels, social-problem films, and
film noir in the U.S. after World War Two: Gentleman\'s Agreement, The
Postman Always Rings Twice, The Best Years of Our Lives. Films like
these, he says, \"emerge for what they are: a mirror of our confusion,
dishonesty, panic, trapped and immobilized in the sunlit prison of the
American dream.\" [[They cut the complexity of human motives and
self-understanding \"down to size\" by preferring \"a lie more palatable
than the truth\" about the social and material effects the liberal
pedagogy of optimism has]{.mark}, or doesn\'t have, on \"man\'s\"
capacity to produce a world of authentic truth, justice, and
freedom]{.underline}.21 Indeed, \"truth\" is the keyword for Baldwin. He
defines it as \"a devotion to the human being, his freedom and
fulfillment: freedom which cannot be legislated, fulfillment which
cannot be charted.\"22 In contrast, Stowe\'s totalitarian religiosity,
her [insistence that subjects \"bargain\" for]{.underline} heavenly
[redemption with their own]{.underline} physical and spiritual
[mortification, merely and violently confirms the fundamental abjection
of all persons, especially the black ones who wear the dark night of the
soul out where all can see it.]{.underline} Additionally, Baldwin argues
that Uncle Tom\'s Cabin instantiates a tradition of locating the destiny
of the nation in a false model of the individual soul, one imagined as
free of ambivalence, aggression, or contradiction. By \"human being\"
Baldwin means to repudiate stock identities as such, arguing that their
stark simplicity confirms the very fantasies and institutions against
which the sentimental is ostensibly being mobilized. [This
national-liberal refusal of complexity is what he elsewhere calls \"the
price of the ticket\" for membership in the American
dream]{.underline}.23 As the Uncle Tom films suggest, [whites need
blacks to \"dance\" for them so that they might continue disavowing the
costs or ghosts of whiteness, which involve religious traditions of
self-loathing and cultural traditions confusing happiness with
analgesia.]{.underline} The conventional reading of \"Everybody\'s
Protest Novel\" sees it as a violent rejection of the sentimental.24 It
is associated with the feminine (Little Women), with hollow and
dishonest capacities of feeling, with an aversion to the real pain that
real experience brings. \"Causes, as we know, are notoriously
bloodthirsty,\" he writes.25 [[The
politico-sentimental]{.underline}]{.mark} novel
[[uses]{.mark}]{.underline} [suffering]{.mark} vampirically [[to
simplify the subject]{.mark}, thereby making the injunction to empathy
safe for the subject]{.underline}. Of course there is more to the story.
Baldwin bewails the senti- mentality of Richard Wright\'s Native Son
because Bigger Thomas is not the homeopathic Other to Uncle Tom after
all, but one of his \"children,\" the heir to his negative legacy.26
Both Tom and Thomas live in a simple relation to violence and die
knowing only slightly more than they did before they were sacrificed to
a white ideal of the soul\'s simple purity, its emptiness. [This
addiction to the [formula of redemption through]{.mark} violent
[simplification persists with a \"terrible power\"]{.mark}: it [confirms
that]{.mark} U.S. [minorities are constituted as Others even to
themselves]{.mark} through attachment to the most hateful, objectified,
cartoon-like versions of their identities, and that the shamed
subcultures of America really are, in some way, fully expressed by the
overpresence of the stereotypical image]{.underline}.

#### Libidinal explanations of racism are wrong -- they confuse habit with instinct

**Hudis 15** (Peter Hudis -- Professor of English and History @ Queens
College, 2015, "Frantz Fanon: Philosopher of the Barricades," Pg. 35-37)

Fanon's vantage point upon the world is his situated experience. He is
trying to understand the inner psychic life of racism, not provide an
account of the structure of human existence as a whole. [[Racism is
not]{.underline}]{.mark}, of course, [[an **integral part** of the human
psyche; it is a **Social construct** that has a **psychic impact**. Any
effort to comprehend]{.mark} social distress that accompanies
[racism]{.mark} by reference [to some a priori structure]{.mark}- be it
the Oedipal Complex or the Collective Unconscious- **[is doomed to
failure.]{.mark}**]{.underline} Carl Jung sought to deepen and go beyond
Freud\'s approach by arguing that the subconscious is grounded in a
universal layer of the psyche- which he called [[\"the collective
unconscious:]{.mark}\' This [refers to inherited patterns]{.mark} of
thought [that exist in all]{.mark} human minds, [regardless of
specific]{.mark} culture or [upbringing]{.mark}]{.underline}, and which
manifest themselves in dreams, fairy tales, and myths. Jung referred to
these universal patterns as \"archetypes:\' It may seem, on a
superficial reading, that 1 Fanon is drawing from Jung, since he
discusses how white people tend to unconsciously assimilate views of
blacks that are based on negative stereotypes. Even the most
\"progressive\" white tends to think of blacks a certain way (such as
\"emotional;\' \"physical,\" or / \"aggressive\"), even as they disavow
any racist animus on their part. However, [Fanon denies that such
collective delusions are part of a psychic structure]{.underline}; they
[are]{.underline} not [**permanent features of the mind**. [They are
**habits** acquired from]{.mark} a series of [social and cultural
impositions]{.mark}. While [they constitute a]{.mark} kind a [collective
unconscious on the part of many]{.mark} white people, [they are
not]{.mark} grounded in any **[universal]{.mark}**
\"archetype.\"]{.underline} The unconscious prejudices of whites do not
derive from genes or nature, nor do they derive from some form
independent of culture or upbringing. Fanon contends
[[that]{.underline}]{.mark} Jung **[[\"confuses habit with
instinct.\"]{.mark}]{.underline}** Fanon objects to Jung\'s \"collective
unconscious\" for the same reason that he rejects the notion of a black
ontology. His phenomenological approach brackets out ontological claims
on both a social and psychological level insofar as the examination of
race and racism is concerned. He writes, \"Neither Freud nor Adler nor
even the cosmic Jung took the black man into consideration in the course
of his research." This does not mean that Fanon rejects their
contributions tout court. He does not deny the existence of the
unconscious. He only denies that the inferiority complex of blacks
operates on an unconscious level. [He does not reject the Oedipal
Complex. He only denies that it explains (especially in the West Indies)
the proclivity of the black \"slave\" to mimic the values of the white
\"master.\"]{.underline} And as seen from his positive remarks on
Lacan\'s theory of the mirror stage, he does not reject the idea of
psychic structure. He only denies that it can substitute for an
historical understanding of the origin of neuroses .23 Fanon adopts a
socio-genetic approach to a study of the psyche because that is what is
adequate for the object of his analysis. For Fanon, [it is the
relationship between the socio-economic and psychological that is of
critical import. He makes it clear, insofar as the subject matter of his
study is concerned, that [the socio-economic is]{.mark} first of all
**[responsible for affective disorders]{.mark}**]{.underline}: \"First,
economic. Then, internalization or rather epidermalization of this
inferiority.\"24 Fanon never misses an opportunity to remind us that
racism owes its origin to specific economic relations of domination-
such as slavery, colonialism, and the effort to coopt sections of the
working class into serving the needs of capital. It is hard to mistake
the Marxist influence here. It does not follow, however, that what comes
first in the order of time has conceptual or strategic priority. The
inferiority complex is originally born from economic subjugation, but it
takes on a life of its own and expresses itself in terms that surpass
the economic. Both sides of the problem-the socio-economic and
psychological-must be combatted in tandem: \"The black man must wage the
struggle on two levels; whereas historically these levels are mutually
dependent, [any unilateral liberation is flawed]{.underline}, and the
worst mistake would be to believe their mutual dependence
automatic:\'\'5 On these grounds he argues that the problem of [[racism
cannot be solved on a psychological level. It is
not]{.underline}]{.mark} [an]{.underline}
**[[\"individual\"]{.underline}]{.mark}** [problem; [it is]{.mark}
a]{.underline} **[[social]{.underline}]{.mark}** one. But neither can it
be solved on a social level that ores the psychological. It is small
wonder that although his name never appears in the book, Fanon was
enamored of the work of Wilhelm Reich. This important Freudian-Marxist
would no doubt feel affinity with Fanon\'s comment, [\"Genuine
disalienation will have been achieved only when things, in the most
materialist sense, have]{.underline} **[resumed their rightful
place]{.underline}**:\'27

#### Reducing black people to fungible bodies and reading their experiences through pain creates the worst form of depoliticization -- not only do they disregard black agency and resistance, they further perpetuate a narrative of white domination

**[Kelley 16,]{.underline}** Robin D.G. Kelley is one of the most
distinguished experts on African American studies and a celebrated
professor who has lectured at some of America's highest learning
institutions. He is currently Professor of American Studies and
Ethnicity at the University of Southern California. 3/22/16, "Black
Study, Black Struggle,"
<http://www.blackagendareport.com/black_study_black_struggle>,

Second only to a desire for increased diversity, better mental health
services were a chief priority for student protesters. Activists framed
their concerns and grievances in the language of personal trauma. We
shouldn't be surprised. While every generation of black Americans has
experienced unrelenting violence, this is the first one compelled to
witness virtually all of it, to endure the snuffing out of black lives
in real time, looped over and over again, until the next murder knocks
it off the news. **[We are also talking about a generation that has
lived through two of the longest wars in U.S. history, raised on a
culture of spectacle where horrific acts of violence are readily
available]{.underline}** on their smartphones. What Henry **[Giroux
insightfully identifies as an addiction does nothing to inure or
desensitize young people to violence]{.underline}**. On the contrary, it
anchors violence in their collective consciousness, produces fear and
paranoia -- wrapped elegantly in thrill -- and shrouds the many ways
capitalism, militarism, and racism are killing black and brown people.
So **[one can easily see why the language of trauma might appeal to
black students. Trauma is real; it is no joke]{.underline}**. Mental
health services and counseling are urgently needed. **[But [reading
black experience through trauma can easily slip into thinking of
ourselves as victims and objects rather than agents, subjected
to]{.mark} centuries of [gratuitous violence that have structured and
overdetermined our]{.mark} very [being]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In the
argot of our day, "**[[bodies]{.mark}" -- [vulnerable and
threatening]{.mark} bodies -- [increasingly stand in for]{.mark} actual
[people with names, experiences, dreams, and
desires]{.mark}]{.underline}**. I suspect that the popularity of
Ta-Nehisi Coates's Between the World and Me (2015), especially among
black college students, rests on his singular emphasis on fear, trauma,
and the black body. He writes: "In America, it is traditional to destroy
the black body---it is heritage. Enslavement was not merely the
antiseptic borrowing of labor---it is not so easy to get a human being
to commit their body against its own elemental interest. And so
enslavement must be casual wrath and random manglings, the gashing of
heads and brains blown out over the river as the body seeks to escape.
It must be rape so regular as to be industrial. . . . The spirit and
soul are the body and brain, which are destructible---that is precisely
why they are so precious. And the soul did not escape. The spirit did
not steal away on gospel wings." **[Coates]{.underline}** implies that
the person is the brain, and the brain just another organ to be crushed
with the rest of the body's parts. Earlier in the book, he **[makes the
startling declaration that enslaved people "knew nothing but
chains.]{.underline}**" **[I do not deny the violence Coates so
eloquently describes]{.underline}** here, and I am sympathetic to his
atheistic skepticism. **[But [what sustained enslaved African people was
a memory of freedom, dreams of seizing it, and conspiracies to enact it
]{.mark}]{.underline}**-- fugitive planning, if you will. **[[If we
reduce the enslaved to]{.mark} mere [fungible bodies, we cannot]{.mark}
possibly [understand how they created families, communities, sociality;
how they fled]{.mark} and [loved]{.mark} and [worshiped]{.mark} [and
defended themselves]{.mark}; [how they created the world's first social
democracy]{.mark}.]{.underline}** "**[[Trauma is real. But reading black
experience through trauma can lead to thinking of ourselves as victims
rather than agents.]{.mark}"]{.underline}** Moreover, **[[to identify
anti-black violence as heritage]{.mark} may be true in a general sense,
but it [obscures the dialectic that produced]{.mark} and reproduced [the
violence of a regime dependent on black life for]{.mark} its
[profitability]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[It was]{.mark}, after all,
[the resisting black body that needed
"correction]{.mark}]{.underline}**." Violence was used not only to break
bodies but to discipline people who refused enslavement. And the impulse
to resist is neither involuntary nor solitary. **[It is a choice made in
community, made possible by community, and informed by memory,
tradition, and witness. If Africans were entirely compliant and docile,
there would have been no need for vast expenditures on corrections,
security, and violence. [Resistance is our
heritage]{.mark}.]{.underline}** And **[[resistance is our
healing]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Through collective struggle, **[[we
alter our circumstances]{.mark}; [contain, escape, or]{.mark} possibly
[eviscerate]{.mark} the source of [trauma]{.mark}; [recover our bodies;
reclaim]{.mark} and redeem [our dead; and make ourselves
whole]{.mark}.]{.underline}** It is difficult to see this in a world
where words such as trauma, PTSD, micro-aggression, and triggers have
virtually replaced oppression, repression, and subjugation. Naomi
Wallace, a brilliant playwright whose work explores trauma in the
context of race, sexuality, class, war, and empire, muses: "Mainstream
America is less threatened by the 'trauma' theory because it doesn't
place economic justice at its core and takes the focus out of the realm
of justice and into psychology; out of the streets, communities, into
the singular experience (even if experienced in common) of the
individual." Similarly, George Lipsitz observes that **[emphasizing
"interiority," personal pain, and feeling elevates "the cultivation of
sympathy over the creation of social justice." This is partly why
demands for reparations to address historical and ongoing racism are so
antithetical to modern liberalism.]{.underline}** "**[Through collective
struggle, we alter our circumstances; contain, escape, or possibly
eviscerate the source of trauma]{.underline}**." **[[Managing trauma
does not require dismantling structural racism]{.mark},]{.underline}**
which is why university administrators focus on avoiding triggers rather
than implementing zero-tolerance policies for racism or sexual assault.
Buildings will be renamed and safe spaces for people of color will be
created out of a sliver of university real estate, but proposals to
eliminate tuition and forgive student debt for the descendants of the
dispossessed and the enslaved will be derided as absurd. This is also
why diversity and cultural-competency training are the most popular
strategies for addressing campus racism. As if racism were a
manifestation of our "incompetent" handling of "difference." If we
cannot love the other, we can at least learn to hear, respect,
understand, and "tolerate" her. Cultural competency also means reckoning
with white privilege, coming to terms with unconscious bias and the
myriad ways white folks benefit from current racial arrangements.
Powerful as this might be, the solution to racism still is shifted to
the realm of self-help and human resources, resting on self-improvement
or the hiring of a consultant or trainer to help us reach our goal.
Cultural-competency training, greater diversity, and demands for
multicultural curricula represent both a resistance to and manifestation
of our current "postracial" moment. In Are We All Postracial Yet?
(2015), David Theo Goldberg correctly sees postracialism as a neoliberal
revision of multicultural discourse, whose proposed remedies to address
racism would in fact resuscitate late-century multiculturalism. But why
hold on to the policies and promises of multiculturalism and diversity,
especially since they have done nothing to dislodge white supremacy?
Indeed I want to suggest that the triumph of multiculturalism marked a
defeat for a radical anti-racist vision. True, multiculturalism emerged
in response to struggles waged by the Black Freedom movement and other
oppressed groups in the 1960s and '70s. But the programmatic adoption of
diversity, inclusion, and multiculturalism vampirized the energy of a
radical movement that began by demanding the complete transformation of
the social order and the eradication of all forms of racial, gender,
sexual, and class hierarchy. The point of liberal multiculturalism was
not to address the historical legacies of racism, dispossession, and
injustice but rather to bring some people into the fold of a "society no
longer seen as racially unjust." What did it bring us? Black elected
officials and black CEOs who helped manage the greatest transfer of
wealth to the rich and oversee the continued erosion of the welfare
state; the displacement, deportation, and deterioration of black and
brown communities; mass incarceration; and planetary war. We talk about
breaking glass ceilings in corporate America while building more jail
cells for the rest. The triumph of liberal multiculturalism also meant a
shift from a radical anti-capitalist critique to a politics of
recognition. This means, for example, that we now embrace the right of
same-sex couples to marry so long as they do not challenge the
institution itself, which is still modeled upon the exchanging of
property; likewise we accept the right of people of color, women, and
queer people to serve in the military, killing and torturing around the
world. "I want to suggest that the triumph of multiculturalism marked a
defeat for a radical anti-racist vision." At the same time, contemporary
calls for cultural competence and tolerance reflect neoliberal logic by
emphasizing individual responsibility and suffering, shifting race from
the public sphere to the psyche. The postracial, Goldberg writes,
"renders individuals solely accountable for their own actions and
expressions, not for their group's." Tolerance in its multicultural
guise, as Wendy Brown taught us, is the liberal answer to managing
difference but with no corresponding transformation in the conditions
that, in the first place, marked certain bodies as suspicious, deviant,
abject, or illegible. Tolerance, therefore, depoliticizes genuine
struggles for justice and power: **[[Depoliticization involves
construing inequality, subordination, marginalization, and social
conflict, which]{.mark} all [require political analysis and political
solutions,]{.mark} as personal and individual, on the one hand, or as
natural, religious, or cultural on the other.]{.underline}** Tolerance
works along both vectors of depoliticization -- it personalizes and it
naturalizes or culturalizes -- and sometimes it intertwines them. But
**[how can we embrace our students and acknowledge their pain while
remaining wary of a culture that reduces structural oppression to
misunderstanding and psychology]{.underline}**? Love, Study, Struggle
Taped inside the top drawer of my desk is a small scrap of paper with
three words scrawled across it: "**[Love, Study,
Struggle]{.underline}**." It serves as a daily reminder of what I am
supposed to be doing. **[[Black]{.mark} study and [resistance]{.mark}
[must begin with]{.mark} love.]{.underline}** James Baldwin understood
love-as-agency probably better than anyone. For him it meant to love
ourselves as black people; it meant making love the motivation for
making revolution; it meant **[[envisioning a society where]{.mark}
everyone is embraced, where [there is no oppression]{.mark},
[where]{.mark} [every life is valued]{.mark} -- [even those who]{.mark}
may once [have been our oppressors]{.mark}]{.underline}**. It did not
mean seeking white people's love and acceptance or seeking belonging in
the world created by our oppressor. In The Fire Next Time (1963), he is
unequivocal: "I do not know many Negroes who are eager to be 'accepted'
by white people, still less to be loved by them; they, the blacks,
simply don't wish to be beaten over the head by the whites every instant
of our brief passage on this planet." But here is the catch: if we are
committed to genuine freedom, we have no choice but to love all. To love
all is to fight relentlessly to end exploitation and oppression
everywhere, even on behalf of those who think they hate us. This was
Baldwin's point -- perhaps his most misunderstood and reviled point.
**[To love this way requires relentless struggle, deep study, and
critique]{.underline}**. **[[Limiting our ambit to suffering,
resistance, and achievement is not enough]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[We
must go to the root -- the historical, political, social, cultural,
ideological, material, economic root -- of oppression in order to
understand its negation, the prospect of our liberation]{.underline}**.
Going to the root illuminates what is hidden from us, largely because
most structures of oppression and all of their various entanglements are
simply not visible and not felt. For example, **[[if we argue that state
violence is merely a manifestation of anti-blackness because that is
what we see and feel, we are left with no theory of the state
and]{.mark} have [no way of understanding racialized police violence in
places]{.mark} such as Atlanta and Detroit, [where most cops are
black]{.mark}, unless we turn to some metaphysical
explanation.]{.underline}** For my generation, the formal classroom was
never the space for deep critique precisely because it was not a place
of love. The classroom was -- and still is -- a performative space,
where faculty and students compete with each other. Through study
groups, we created our own intellectual communities held together by
principle and love, though the specters of sectarianism, ego, and
just-plain childishness blurred our vision and threatened our
camaraderie. Still, the political study group was our lifeblood -- both
on and off campus. We lived by Karl Marx's pithy 1844 statement: "But if
the designing of the future and the proclamation of ready-made solutions
for all time is not our affair, then we realize all the more clearly
what we have to accomplish in the present -- I am speaking of a ruthless
criticism of everything existing, ruthless in two senses: The criticism
must not be afraid of its own conclusions, nor of conflict with the
powers that be." "If we argue that state violence is merely a
manifestation of anti-blackness because that is what we see and feel, we
are left with no theory of the state and have no way of understanding
racialized police violence." Study groups introduced me to C. L. R.
James, Frantz Fanon, Walter Rodney, Barbara Smith, Angela Davis, Karl
Marx, Friedrich Engels, Vladimir Lenin, Chancellor Williams, George E.
M. James, Shulamith Firestone, Kwame Nkrumah, Kwame Turé, Rosa
Luxemburg, Antonio Gramsci, Chinweizu Ibekwe, Amílcar Cabral, and
others. These texts were our sources of social critique and weapons in
our class war on the bourgeois canon. As self-styled
activist-intellectuals, it never occurred to us to refuse to read a text
simply because it validated the racism, sexism, free-market ideology,
and bourgeois liberalism against which we railed. Nothing was off
limits. On the contrary, delving into these works only sharpened our
critical faculties. Love and study cannot exist without struggle, and
struggle cannot occur solely inside the refuge we call the university.
Being grounded in the world we wish to make is fundamental. As I argued
in Freedom Dreams nearly fifteen years ago, "Social movements generate
new knowledge, new theories, new questions. **[The most [radical
ideas]{.mark} often [grow out of a concrete intellectual engagement with
the problems of aggrieved populations confronting systems of
oppression."]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}Ironically I wrote these
words with my students in mind, many of whom were involved in campus
struggles, feeling a bit rudderless but believing that the only way to
make themselves into authentic activists was to leave the books and
radical theories at home or in their dorms. The undercommons offers
students a valuable model of study that takes for granted the
indivisibility of thought and struggle, not unlike its antecedent, the
Mississippi Freedom Schools.

#### Ontologizing blackness [destroys]{.underline} alt solvency and [homogenizes]{.underline} black bodies.

David **KLINE**, Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Religion at Rice
University, **17** \["The Pragmatics of Resistance: Framing
Anti-Blackness and the Limits of Political Ontology," *Critical
Philosophy of Race*, Vol. 5, No. 1, 2017, p. 51-69, Accessed Online
through Emory Libraries\]

Focusing on Wilderson, his **[[absolute prioritization of a political
onto-logical structure]{.underline}]{.mark}** in which the law relegates
Black being into the singular position of social death happens, I
contend, at the expense of two significant things that I am hesitant to
bracket for the sake of prioritizing political ontology as the sole
frame of reference for both analyzing anti-Black racism and thinking
resistance within the racialized world. First, it [**[short-circuits an
analysis of power]{.mark} that might reveal** not only **how** the
**practices**, forms, and **apparatuses of anti-Black racism have
historically developed**, changed, and reassembled/reterritorialized in
relation to state power, national identity, philosophical discourse,
biological discourse, political discourse, and so on---changes that,
despite Wilderson's claim that focusing on these things only "mystify"
the question of ontology]{.underline} (Wilderson 2010, 10), surely have
implications for how racial positioning is both thought and resisted in
differing historical and socio-political contexts. To the extent that
Blackness equals a singular ontological position within a macropolitical
structure of antagonism, there is almost no room to bring in the
spectrum and flow of social difference and contingency that no doubt
spans across Black identity as a legitimate issue of analysis and as a
site/sight for the possibility of a range of resisting practices. This
bracketing of difference leads him to make some rather sweeping and
opaquely abstract claims. For example, discussing a main character's
abortion in a prison cell in the 1976 film Bush Mama, Wilderson says,
"Dorothy will abort her baby at the clinic or on the floor of her prison
cell, not because she fights for---and either wins \[End Page 58\] or
loses---the right to do so, but because she is one of 35 million
accumulated and fungible (owned and exchangeable) objects living among
230 million subjects---which is to say, her will is always already
subsumed by the will of civil society" (Wilderson 2010, 128, italics
mine). What I want to press here is how Wilderson's statement, made in
the sole frame of a [**[totalizing political ontology]{.mark}**
overshadowing all other levels of sociality, **[flattens]{.mark}** out
the **[social difference within]{.mark}**, and even the possibility of,
**[a micropolitical social field of 35 million Black people]{.mark}**
living in the United States]{.underline}. [Such a flattening reduces the
optic of anti-Black racism as well as Black sociality to the frame of
political ontology where **[Blackness remains stuck in a singular
position of abjection]{.mark}**. **[The result is a severe analytical
limitation in]{.mark}** terms of **[the way
Blackness]{.mark}**]{.underline} (as well as other racial positions)
[**[exists across an extremely wide field of sociality]{.mark}** that is
**[comprised of differing]{.mark}** intensities of **[forces]{.mark}**
and relational modes **[between various]{.mark}** institutional,
political, socio-[**economic**, **religious, sexual, and other social
conjunctures**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Within Wilderson's political
ontological frame, [it seems that these conjunctures are excluded---or
at least bracketed---as having any bearing at all on how anti-Black
power functions and is resisted across highly differentiated
contexts]{.underline}. [**[There is only the binary]{.mark}**
ontological distinction **[of Black and Human]{.mark}** being; only a
macropolitics of sedimented abjection]{.underline}.

#### Their psychoanalytic explanations of the libidinal drive to be anti-black is bad and false

**Hudis 15** (Professor of English and History @ Queens College, 2015,
"Frantz Fanon: Philosopher of the Barricades," p. 35)

Fanon's vantage point upon the world is his situated experience. He is
trying to understand the inner psychic life of racism, not provide an
account of the structure of human existence as a whole. [[Racism is
not]{.underline}]{.mark}, of course, [[an **integral part** of the human
psyche; it is a **Social construct** that has a **psychic impact**. Any
effort to comprehend]{.mark} social distress that accompanies [racism by
reference to some a priori structure- be it]{.mark} the Oedipal Complex
or [the Collective Unconscious- **is doomed to
failure.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

Carl Jung sought to deepen and go beyond Freud\'s approach by arguing
that the subconscious is grounded in a universal layer of the psyche-
which he called [[\"the collective unconscious:\']{.mark} This [refers
to inherited patterns]{.mark} of thought [that exist in all]{.mark}
human minds, [regardless of specific]{.mark} culture or
[upbringing]{.mark}]{.underline}, and which manifest themselves in
dreams, fairy tales, and myths. Jung referred to these universal
patterns as \"archetypes:\' It may seem, on a superficial reading, that
1 Fanon is drawing from Jung, since he discusses how white people tend
to unconsciously assimilate views of blacks that are based on negative
stereotypes. Even the most \"progressive\" white tends to think of
blacks a certain way (such as \"emotional;\' \"physical,\" or /
\"aggressive\"), even as they disavow any racist animus on their part.
However, [[Fanon denies that]{.mark} such collective [delusions]{.mark}
are part of a psychic structure]{.underline}; they
[[are]{.underline}]{.mark} not [[**permanent features of the mind**.
They are **habits** acquired from]{.mark} a series of [social and
cultural impositions]{.mark}. While [they constitute a]{.mark} kind a
[collective unconscious on the part of many white people, they are
not]{.mark} grounded in any **[universal]{.mark}**
\"archetype.\"]{.underline} The unconscious prejudices of whites do not
derive from genes or nature, nor do they derive from some form
independent of culture or upbringing. Fanon contends [that]{.underline}
Jung **[\"confuses habit with instinct.\"]{.underline}**

#### They need to prove why we specifically do is racist -- we don't have to defend the entirety of Baudrillard or his work -- you can use someone's work and not agree with them -- the founders of the USFG were racists but using the USFG isn't racist, if you buy any of their indicts, you'll reject the 1ac

Yet I should make one thing clear: [the term \'seduction\' has been used
everywhere and anywhere in a whole string of senses]{.underline}, [such
as]{.underline} \'power seduces the masses\', the \'seduction of the
media\' or [the \'great seducers\']{.underline} . . . [I did not mean
the term at that level which is, after all, extremely
vulgar.]{.underline} [It is true that it seemed to me that historically,
women had a privileged position in the field of seduction. But some have
taken the view that to link women and seduction was to consign them to
the realm of appearances - and hence to frivolity. This is a total
misunderstanding: the seduction I was referring to is really the
symbolic mastery of forms, whereas the other is merely the material
mastery of power by way of a stratagem.]{.underline}

### Asia Territory Disputes 

#### The attempt to manage the territorial disputes of the North East Asia's maritime conflicts is a writing of the Westphalian notion of territory onto space, engendering an attempt at total mapping, transcription, and integral reality. This is a violent imposition of Western identity onto the globe.

[The first 'post-Cold War' row occurred in 1996]{.underline}, two years
after the ratification of UNCLOS, [when [Japanese Foreign
Minister]{.mark} Ikeda Yukihiko [attacked the South Korean claim to the
islands]{.mark} and demanding the South Korean ceased their development
[of Dokdo, and 'reminding' Korea that "Takeshima is]{.mark}]{.underline}
[\[[an integral]{.underline}\] [part of Japanese
territory]{.underline}]{.mark} (waga kuni koyū no ryūdo) [from the
viewpoint of international law and history]{.underline}."105 Ikeda's
statement, while certainly controversial --- in fact, leading to his
effigy burned in ensuing protests --- is in fact using very
similar[,]{.mark} [if not almost identical language to statements made
during the 1980s by Ikeda's predecessors and is almost identical to the
wording currently used on the current Japanese Ministry of Foreign
Affairs website: "Takeshima is according to history and from the
viewpoint of international law clearly an integral part of Japanese
territory."]{.underline}106 Neither statement deviates a great deal from
the position held by Japan since the post-war period, not to mention
mirroring Korea's own claims to Dokdo, such as a multilingual, flashy
website run by the Gyeongsangbuk-do Province Dokdo Management Office,
which states, "Historically and according to International Law, Dokdo is
clearly Territory of Korea." 107 [This is also strikingly similar
statements made by the governments of Japan 108 and China 109 regarding
the Senkaku Islands. In both cases, **there is an interesting
contradiction between the phrase ['integral
territory']{.mark}**]{.underline} (koyū no ryōdo) 110 **[and the
invocation of international law]{.underline}**, [which is, **the concept
of an 'integral'** or 'inalienable' **territory is**]{.underline},
according to Gavan McCormack, "[**[unknown in international law and
foreign to discourse on national territory in]{.mark} much**, if not
[most, of the world]{.mark}.]{.underline}"111 Likewise, [[while East
Asian states certainly knew how to be territorial before the
introduction of the Westphalian system]{.mark}, far from the unalienable
space of the Japanese, Korean, or Chinese national territories
stretching back to times immemorial, [the idea of delineated
territory]{.mark} of the nation-state [being sacrosanct is a quite
recent development]{.mark} in the [in East Asia]{.mark}n
history]{.underline} (or European history, for that matter) and further
begs the question of **[[which parts of these territorial spaces is
unintegral]{.mark}?]{.underline}** The very idea of a nation's territory
being integral brings to mind Jean Baudrillard's famous opening
illustration of Simulacra and Simulation where [[Baudrillard describes
Jorge Luis Borges']{.mark} (very) short [story]{.mark} "On Exactitude in
Science" in which an Empire's cartographers draw a map of the territory
so detailed that it covers the entirety of the Empire, with the fraying
of the map signalling the decline of the Empire.]{.underline}
Baudrillard then attempts to reverse this analogy, saying, "**[[the map
... precedes the territory ... \[but]{.mark} now\] [it is the territory
whose shreds slowly rot across the extent of the
map]{.mark}]{.underline}**," before conceding that "**[[only the
allegory of Empire]{.mark}, perhaps [remains]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Because **[[it is with this same imperialism that present-day simulators
attempt to make the real, all of the real, coincide with their models of
simulations]{.underline}]{.mark}**."112 In this almost McLuhanian sense,
[[the 'Empire' is the map, and the envisioned territory/map is in this
sense the 'nodal point' which holds together the imagined
community]{.mark},]{.underline} as Benedict Anderson would have it[, [of
the national-state]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[In the case of China]{.mark}
where, [like other communist countries, the Party, state, and society
are synonymous, the issue of sovereignty "suggests the government's
inherently legitimate]{.mark}]{.underline} (highest, sublime and
absolute) right and power to rule the country domestically and to act
independently (including in the area of defence) internationally."113 I
would argue that [[irredentism is rooted in this phenomenon, where the
'lost' or defended territory essentially must be elevated to something
of a sublime object to maintain illusion of the 'integral' territory of
the nation-state]{.underline}]{.mark}, and perhaps of the contending
nation-states themselves. This phenomenon can be seen unambiguously on
the Gyeongsangbuk-do Province's Dokdo website which declares, "We
planted the spirit of Korea in Dokdo." 114 [[While it's easy to mock the
rhetoric of politicians]{.underline}]{.mark} (such as the use of
'integral', or in China's case, 'sacred'), [[anything less would render
these disputes absurd, bringing us back to the notion of vulgar
'squabbling over rocks', and in the process, exposing the 'nakedness' of
the nation behind national ideologies]{.mark}.]{.underline} This is why,
[[not just in China, but in South Korea and Japan, the legitimacy of the
ruling party has come to rest precariously on the party's ability to
maintain these territorial disputes]{.underline}]{.mark} (which, if
we're being practical, simply won't be solved when multiple claimants
consider the same territories 'integral'), [[and in the case of Taiwan,
the survival of the Republic of China as an autonomous entity is at
stake]{.underline}]{.mark}: if Taiwan were to break the status quo by
renouncing its territorial claims, it would be a de facto declaration of
independence from the mainland which, as mentioned above, would likely
lead to a Chinese invasion. While, economically, détente is always
preferable and proponents of the 'liberal peace' theory claim that it is
growing economic interdependence which has restrained the claimant
countries, as we have seen in both the Dokdo and Senkaku Islands
disputes, maintaining the disputes can be a powerful tool for savvy
politicians. [This is likely a major reason these disputes have become
more common in South Korea's democratic era, flaring up every few years
instead of every couple of decades]{.underline}, or for that matter, [in
China since the collapse of the communist bloc, and during the era of
globalization where national borders are often thought to be
disappearing.]{.underline}

### **[Capitalism]{.underline}**

#### Neoliberal violence takes place on the level of semiotics and code, their critique of economic systems doesn't account for the fluidity of communication and media.

Bodies with Queer Machines\", DOA:

Today\'s world of global [capitalism]{.underline} and proliferating
technologies [is]{.underline} often [described in terms of
flows]{.underline}. Flows---of people, goods, money, ideas, images---
move between borders---of nations, economies, cultures---making this an
age of deterritorialization as much as reterritorialization. [Production
has shifted from the]{.underline} Fordist model (Harvey 1989) of a
[rationalized labor force]{.underline}: of core workers who stay in one
place and earn enough wages to consume what they produce---the mass
produced goods that embed both the desires and discipline of a modern
lifestyle. [Today]{.underline}, [production is based on]{.underline}
\"[flexible accumulation]{.underline}\" where, geared to quick turn-over
and a constantly changing market, companies have downsized their core
workers, diversified their holdings and product lines, and rely more on
subcontractors, peripheral workers and out-sourcing. Increasingly [there
is a gap between those who produce and consume brand]{.underline} name
good[s]{.underline}---[Nike]{.underline} or Adidas [shoes]{.underline},
for instance---and continually, in the United States at least, [the gap
is rising between]{.underline} the so-called [haves and
havenots]{.underline} accompanied by a shrinkage of the middle class
in-between. The condition of postmodernity in which we live is one of
shifts and dispersals, instability and movement, speed and ephemerality.
Ever more [our world is being remade]{.underline} and redrawn
[through]{.underline} various technologies---[image and
info]{.underline}rmation [production]{.underline}, medical and genetic
advances, military and star war networks. [Our connections are
quicker]{.underline} (whether [by]{.underline} travel, [phone, email, or
CNN]{.underline}) to places and peoples further away; [disconnections
are quick too]{.underline}---[ruptures]{.underline} of families,
communities, workplaces, schools. David Harvey (1989) speaks of
time-space compression and the [increased attention placed on the
immediate and instantaneous]{.underline} in postmodern lifestyle.
[Consumption is more important than ever]{.underline} in advanced
capitalist economies and [images not only sell commodities but are
commodities]{.underline} themselves, [operating in an economy that
reifies the]{.underline} surfaces and [impressions of
things]{.underline}. Major consumer values are instantaneity---fast food
and speedy services---and disposability---goods that can be easily and
quickly thrown out. [Reproductions or simulacra are valued over
originals]{.underline} and [the cultural logic of
postmodernity]{.underline}, as theorized by Frederic Jameson (1984), [is
marked by an aesthetic of the pastiche]{.underline}---the jumbling of
mixed genres and past and present time periods---and schizophrenia---the
[experience of life as disjointed]{.underline}, incoherent, and lacking
linear continuity. It is against this backdrop that I want to read
[children\'s play]{.underline} and, in particular, a form of play [in
which the media]{.underline} in the United States [has]{.underline}
taken such [a keen interest]{.underline}: [violent
entertainment]{.underline}. Within this category [characterized by a
prominence of attacks]{.underline}, shootings, [ruptured
body-parts]{.underline}, [and hyper-weapons]{.underline} is a
[sub-set]{.underline} in which [the explosiveness of violence is coupled
with another]{.underline}, far less studied dimension, [the making and
remaking of]{.underline} a new kind of subject---[the
cyborg]{.underline}. Following Donna Haraway (1991), I take
[cyborg]{.underline} to be [a fusion of artificial machinery and
living]{.underline} (animal, human, or alien) organism [that confuses
prior identity borders]{.underline}. [This confusion is marked
by]{.underline} both a [dislocation and reaggregation]{.underline} of
bodies and body parts (of and between nature, nation, race, community,
gender, commodity, and/or culture)---what I [trace here through
violence]{.underline} and queerness. The [figure of the cyborg has
become exceedingly popular]{.underline} in (and circulates between) two
sites I pay attention to---mass produced play in Japan and the United
States since the 1980s that spreads across the multimedia of comic books
(manga in Japan), cartoons (anime), film, live action television, video
(and gameboy) games, and merchandise such as action figures.6
Replicants, terminators, RoboCops, and power rangers are the figures of
this play world. And [all are identified as not only cyborgs but also
fighting machines]{.underline}: [beings whose

#### Capitalism no longer exists in a material sense but rather an extra-material sense. Objects are not the locus of satisfaction, but of a symbolic labor, a production fabricated as proof -- an uninterrupted representation -- of status. The sign must be overcome to engage in effective praxis

Post-leftists --- a loose school of anarchist thinkers who generally
believe that \"\[traditional\] leftism always involves the reification
and mediation of social revolt, while consistent anarchists reject this
reification of revolt\"1 --- adore Jean Baudrillard. Post-leftist TikTok
has breathed what seems to be a new vigour into his work, heavily
promoting him for his conception of hyperreality and simulation.
Post-leftist TikToks citing Baudrillard are generally bleak and obscure,
filled with walls of text citing the impossibility of escaping
capitalism due to the saturation of the social world with the norms of
capital. [All revolutionary actions are already co-opted]{.underline},
and [no fertile ground is left to build truly revolutionary
ideas]{.underline}. [We are trapped in the desert of the
real]{.underline}, [with no way out]{.underline}. It appears that
Baudrillard, the prince of postmodernism, has nothing to offer those
thinking from a historical materialist perspective. But I would argue
the opposite; [we should not be]{.underline} so [quick to
dismiss]{.underline} some of [Baudrillard\'s]{.underline} unique
[insights into the machinations of capital]{.underline} on the basis of
his appropriation by the post-leftists. While scholars like Douglas
Kellner have critiqued Baudrillard's concepts of the simulation and
hyperreality at length with the intention of rescuing them, I am not
interested in salvaging his later work.2 Instead, my goal is to retrieve
a lesser-known theorization from his earlier work --- known as \"[sign
value]{.underline},\" which I believe is the key [Baudrillardian concept
that allows for the most fertile thinking through resistance to
capitalism]{.underline}. If [we are to take Baudrillard's points about
the proliferation of images and sign production under late capitalism
seriously]{.underline} --- and we should --- [rescuing]{.underline} the
concept of [sign value]{.underline} from obscurity [is]{.underline} the
[best]{.underline} way to do so. A Brief Overview of Baudrillard\'s
Thought Before delving into sign value, it is important to take a detour
through the development of Baudrillard's intellectual history. The most
helpful way to think about the evolution of Baudrillard's thought, in my
mind, is in terms of an epistemological break, a la Louis Althusser.
This break marks a split between a Baudrillard who embraced Marx and the
tenets of historical materialism, and a [Baudrillard]{.underline} who
[rejected Marxism]{.underline}. This break is not a fully complete one,
nor is it a sudden one; it is a gradual shift that occurs over the
course of Baudrillard's corpus. Viewed in this way, only the first three
texts from Baudrillard's corpus become directly useful to the historical
materialist project: The System of Objects (SO) \[1968\], The Consumer
Society (CS) \[1970\], and For a Critique of the Political Economy of
the Sign (FCPES) \[1972\]. With these three texts, it is clear that
[Baudrillard]{.underline} is working from a Marxist position, albeit a
heterodox one that attempts to build new systems of analysis onto
historical materialism. SO [takes a phenomenological look
at]{.underline} the experience of [consumption under]{.underline} late
[capitalism]{.underline}, [infusing Marxism with semiotics]{.underline}
and psychoanalysis [to]{.underline} systematically [explain the
dominating power objects hold over consumers]{.underline}. CS follows
similar themes, speaking more broadly about systems of leisure and
consumption in relation to the development of the capitalist mode of
production, arguing that [production is]{.underline}
\"[entangled]{.underline}\... [with]{.underline} an order of
[consumption]{.underline}, [which is an order of the manipulation of
signs]{.underline}.\"3 FCPES is a collection of essays tackling
[Marxist]{.underline} and classical analyses of commodities and
consumption, [focusing mostly on how their inadequacy in relation to the
problematic of signs and signification in consumer
societies]{.underline}. With the publication of his fourth book, The
Mirror of Production (MoP) \[1973\], Baudrillard renounced [the Marxist
project]{.underline}, dismissing it [as simply a]{.underline}
\"[mirror]{.underline}\" [of capitalist political economy
that]{.underline} merely re-[inscribes productivism as]{.underline} the
sole site of [societal meaning]{.underline}. [Marxism could
n]{.underline}o[t]{.underline} [serve as a way out of capitalism because
capitalism served as the limit of its horizon]{.underline}. Thus,
\"[historical materialism]{.underline}, dialectics, modes of
[production]{.underline}, [labor]{.underline} power --- [through these
concepts Marxist theory]{.underline} has sought to shatter the abstract
universality of the concepts of bourgeois thought (Nature and Progress,
Man and Reason, formal Logic, Work, Exchange, etc.). Yet Marxism in turn
[universalizes them with a]{.underline} \'critical\' [imperialism as
ferocious as the other's]{.underline}.\"4 Though some of its critiques
certainly land in terms of criticizing a dogmatic, reified
Marxism-Leninism, the thrust of the book relies on a misreading of Marx
and the critique of political economy. We will return to this
strawmanning of Marx and Marxism later, as it becomes a central fulcrum
in the more dodgy assertions Baudrillard makes. The Concept of Sign
Value With the accelerating development of the capitalist mode of
production, [Baudrillard saw a correlated rise in]{.underline} the
[production of images and signs]{.underline}, as well as the more
important role they began to play in late capitalist societies. This
insight is very much linked to the work of the Situationists, who
theorized the onset of the \"society of the spectacle5\" and the
mediation of society through the proliferation of images.6 Other Marxist
critics have also noted this shift in the importance and proliferation
of images in late capitalism: Roland [Barthes examined]{.underline} the
[importance of signs in]{.underline} the development of [ideological
myths that help]{.underline} to [reproduce the system of
cap]{.underline}italism,7 and Fredric [Jameson linked]{.underline} the
[mass prolife]{.underline}ration [of images to postmodernity as the
cultural logic of late capitalism]{.underline}.8 [It]{.underline} i[s
this shift in]{.underline} the importance of [images and signs to
capitalism's reproduction that Baudrillard wishes to
tackle]{.underline}. For Baudrillard, [consumption is a form of
production on the side of the consumer]{.underline}: [Objects are not
the locus of the satisfaction of needs]{.underline}, [but]{.underline}
of a [symbolic labor]{.underline}, of a 'production' in both sense of
the term pro-ducers -- [they are fabricated]{.underline}, but [they are
also produced as]{.underline} a [proof]{.underline}. They are the locus
of consecration of an effort, of [an uninterrupted
performance]{.underline}, of a stress for achievement, [aiming always at
providing the continual and tangible proof of social
value]{.underline}.9 In contrast to the presentation of consumption as a
passive activity where one is wholly interpellated or integrated into a
social position through signs and images, Baudrillard's model of
consumption posits that \"individuals and groups use it to their
advantage, together with its imperative and distinctive repertory of
objects, as is the case with any other institutional or moral code. That
is to say, they use it in their own way: they play with it, they break
its rules, they speak it with their class dialect.\"10 Such insights are
remarkably similar to those of Raymond [Williams]{.underline}, whose
cultural materialist conceptions [viewed culture and]{.underline} the
[means of communication as]{.underline} a [central component
to]{.underline} the [means of
production]{.underline}.11[Consumption]{.underline}, then,
[is]{.underline} not simply premised on the maximization of utility, but
as [the only option available]{.underline} to individuals living under
monopoly capitalism to distinguish themselves in the capitalist social
order --- [one must embody the contradiction]{.underline} of fitting
into an intelligible social position through sticking-out. According to
Baudrillard, it is [this being caught-up]{.underline} with the game of
signification, the pressure to consume, organize, and present objects,
that [constitutes the]{.underline} dominant [everyday experience
of]{.underline} the individual under [capitalism]{.underline}. It is
through such movement that we can see some forms of resistance begin to
show in Baudrillard's model: [Objects]{.underline}, their syntax, [and
their rhetoric refer to]{.underline} social objectives and to a [social
logic]{.underline}. [They speak]{.underline} to us... of [social
pretension and resignation]{.underline}, of [social mobility and
inertia]{.underline}, [of accumulation and enculturation]{.underline},
[of stratification and of social classification]{.underline}. [Through
objects]{.underline}, [each individual and each group searches
out]{.underline} ~~his-her~~ {[their]{.underline}} [place]{.underline}
in an order, all the [while trying to jostle this order]{.underline}
according to a personal trajectory.12 [The central fulcrum point
of]{.underline} Baudrillard's insistence of [the productive nature of
consumption is sign value]{.underline}. [Sign value is his addition to
the Marxist triumvirate of use]{.underline} value,
[exchange]{.underline} value, [and Value]{.underline} (abstract labour)
[of]{.underline} the [commodity]{.underline} form. [Sign value is the
value a commodity]{.underline} (in Baudrillard's terms, an object)
[holds in a hierarchical system of signs]{.underline}, which one can
interpret as the prestige or meaning a commodity holds. Thus, alongside
the political economy of the commodity, [there is a political economy of
the sign]{.underline} --- which engenders its own critique. In this new,
melded political economy, \"\[the\] simplest component, \[the\] nuclear
element --- that which precisely [the commodity was for
Marx]{.underline} --- [is no longer]{.underline} today properly [either
commodity or sign]{.underline}, [but indissolubly both]{.underline}.\"13
In his short theoretical sketch \"For a General Theory,\" [Baudrillard
models the relation]{.underline}s [between all]{.underline} of these
[forms of value]{.underline} as such: UV\[use value\]-EcEV\[economic
exchange value\]: The field of the process of exchange value, of the
commodity form (forme merchandise) etc., described by political economy.
Productive consumption. UV-SgEV\[sign exchange value\]: The field of the
production of signs originating in the destruction of utility... here,
the advertising process of conferring value transmutes use goods into
sign values. Here technique and knowledge are divorced from their
objective practice and recovered by the \"cultural\" system of
differentiation. It is thus the extended field of consumption, in the
sense we have given it of production, systems and interplay of signs...
EcEV-UV: This is the process of \"consumption\" in the traditional
economic sense of the term, that is, the reconversion of exchange value
into use value... \[UV-EcEV\] and \[EcEV-UV\] are the two moments of the
cycle of classical (and Marxist) political economy, which does not take
into account the political economy of the sign... EcEV-SgEV: The process
of consumption according to its redefinition in the political economy of
the sign. It includes the act of spending as production of sign value...
but here more accurately we have the ascension of the commodity form
into the sign form, the transformation of the economic into sign systems
and the transmutation of economic power into domination and social caste
privilege. SgEV-UV: Signs, like commodities, are at once use value and
exchange value. The social hierarchies, the invidious differences, the
privileges of caste and culture which they support, are accounted as
profit, as personal satisfaction, and lived as \"need\" (need of social
value-generation to which correspond the \"utility\" of different signs
and their "consumption"). SgEV-EcEV: This involves the reconversion of
cultural privilege, of the monopoly of sign, etc., into economic
privilege. Coupled with \[EcEV-SgEV\], this reconversion describes the
total cycle of a political economy in which economic exploitation based
on the monopoly of capital and \"cultural\" domination based on the
monopoly of the code engender one another ceaselessly.14 [With this
model]{.underline}, [we can]{.underline} begin to [distinguish
between]{.underline} different [types of consumption]{.underline},
[including]{.underline} that of ordinary consumption (EcEV-UV) and
productive consumption (UV-EcEV), but also [new forms]{.underline} of
consumption [related to]{.underline} the production of
[signs]{.underline}: what we might call conspicuous consumption
(EcEV-SgEV), and sign consumption (SgEV-EcEV). [Paying attention to
these new]{.underline} consumptive [relations]{.underline}, in tandem
with the traditional consumptive relations of Marxian political economy,
[reveals a more complex political economy]{.underline} that does not
merely see the production of ideology as a mere homogenous reflection of
the base, but as a sort of semi-autonomous yet overdetermined practice
and labour performed not just by ideological state apparatuses, but also
by the individual consumer. Thus, [the domineering and totalizing logic
of the sign]{.underline} --- of capitalist ideology ---
[must]{.underline}, in tandem with generalized commodity production, [be
ruthlessly critiqued and overcome]{.underline} if one is [to engage in
effective praxis]{.underline}.

Semiocapitalism and the Maternal from a Daughter's Point of View\", DOA:

In the book, Bifo articulates his thinking about
[semiocapitalism]{.underline}, the system whereby
[capitalism]{.underline}[^1^](https://www.mamsie.bbk.ac.uk/article/id/4310/#n1)
[and the media are connected]{.underline}, arguing that [today it is not
possible to reflect on one without linking it to the other]{.underline}.
His main argument is that [today we are living through individual and
community pathologies caused by semiocapitalism]{.underline}, and in
particular [by the]{.underline} specific [relation between cyberspace
and cybertime]{.underline}. [Cyberspace is]{.underline} the totality of
the [information]{.underline} and stimuli [that circulate via
media]{.underline} systems. [Cybertime is the]{.underline} organic
bodily [capacity to deal with]{.underline} and elaborate
[information]{.underline}, which therefore has bodily a limit.
[The]{.underline} dramatic [relation]{.underline} between the two, what
he calls "splitterkapitalism", [creates clashes]{.underline} that bring
about a multitude of problems for people in spheres such as labour,
mental health, sexuality and affective life. Bifo observes that [the
current semiocapitalist order started]{.underline} to take this
direction in Western societies in 1977, [when]{.underline} hope and
ideas of changing the economic, social and political organisation of
society which had characterised many of the political
[movements]{.underline} in the previous decades, [started to
fail]{.underline}. Bifo considers the 1990s to be a period of total
identification, within the general Zeitgeist, with capital. Because of
this identification, all technological changes were seen as forms of
liberation and as creations of new spaces of freedom. The following
decade, the 2000s, has for Bifo been characterised by a form of cultural
depression resulting from the realisation that the mania of the '90s
could not last. [Monopolies emerged violently from the new world created
by the internet and digital technologies]{.underline}. [The potential
for]{.underline} the internet and [new digital tech]{.underline}nologies
[to allow people to live]{.underline} well, work less and have more time
for affective and [intellectual life were not realised]{.underline}.
Indeed, [the opposite occurred]{.underline}. The sphere of labour
encroached on all aspects of individual and social life, and daily life
became submerged under a continuous flux of information. Bifo discusses
[the end of previous social class divisions]{.underline}, and speaks
about the '"cognitariat'", the international group of workers involved
in cognitive and emotional labour. He does not see any way for this form
of spittlerkapitalism to end, but he proposes the creation of autonomous
spaces in people's lives as an antidote to some of the problems created
by this wider context. Going back to that morning, I think that nobody
helping my mother can be read as an instance in which semiocapitalism
dictates that, simply put, [appearance is more important]{.underline}
than helping someone in need. Although it may be problematic to render
an ethical and political question from this small event, what I want to
stress is the framework through which I am making this claim. I am less
interested here in discussing the subject of appearance versus the
question of help, but more in showing how a single micro act can reflect
a wider organization of relations that has to do with economic
production, and the related symbolic sphere. I also want to open up a
potential reflection on the maternal and semiocapitalism.

**Opening ourselves up repeatedly to the depressing representation of
maudlin bodies suffering from capitalism is an affective investment in
abjection that we do to feed our symbolic hunger through charity
cannibalism -- open the wound and let shame bring down the system.**

French sociologist, philosopher and cultural theorist,
Published: 1992, \<IKS\> \"The illusion of the end\", DOA:
6-21-2022, page 66-70)

[The end of history]{.underline}, being itself a catastrophe [can only
be fuelled by catastrophe.]{.underline} Managing [the end therefore
becomes synonymous with the management of catastrophe.]{.underline} And,
quite specifically, of [that catastrophe which is the slow extermination
of the rest of the world]{.underline}. We have long denounced the
capitalistic, economic exploitation of the poverty of the \'other half
of the world\' \[l\'autre monde\]. [We must today denounce
the]{.underline} moral and sentimental [exploitation of]{.underline}
that [poverty - charity cannibalism being worse than oppressive
violence]{.underline}. The extraction and humanitarian reprocessing of a
destitution which has become the equivalent of oil deposits and gold
mines. [The extortion of the spectacle of poverty and]{.underline}, at
the same time, of our [charitable condescension]{.underline}: a
worldwide appreciated surplus of fine sentiments and bad conscience. We
should, in fact, [see this]{.underline} not as the extraction of raw
materials, but [as]{.underline} a [waste-reprocessing]{.underline}
enterprise. [Their destitution and our bad conscience are]{.underline},
in effect, all [part of]{.underline} the [waste-products]{.underline} of
history- the main thing is [to recycle them to produce a new energy
source]{.underline}. We have here an escalation in the psychological
balance of terror. [World capitalist oppression is]{.underline} now
[merely the vehicle and alibi for this other, much more ferocious, form
of moral predation]{.underline}. One might almost say, contrary to the
Marxist analysis, that [material exploitation is only there to extract
that spiritual raw material that is the misery of people]{.underline}s,
[which serves as psychological nourishment for the]{.underline} rich
countries and [media nourishment for our daily lives]{.underline}. The
\'Fourth World\' (we are no longer dealing with a \'developing\' Third
World) is once again beleaguered, this time as a catastrophe-bearing
stratum. [The West is whitewashed in the reprocessing of the rest of the
world as waste and residue. And the white world repents and seeks
absolution - it, too, the waste-product of its own history]{.underline}.
[The South is a]{.underline} natural [producer of]{.underline} raw
materials, the latest of which is [catastrophe]{.underline}. [The
North]{.underline}, for its part, [specializes in the reprocessing
of]{.underline} raw materials and hence also in the reprocessing of
[catastrophe]{.underline}. [Bloodsucking protection]{.underline},
humanitarian interference, Medecins sans frontieres, international
solidarity, etc. [The last phase of colonialism: the New Sentimental
Order is merely the latest form of the New World Order]{.underline}.
[Other people\'s destitution becomes our adventure
playground]{.underline}. Thus, [the humanitarian offensive]{.underline}
aimed at the Kurds - a show of repentance on the part of the Western
powers after allowing Saddam Hussein to crush them - [is]{.underline} in
reality merely [the second phase of the war]{.underline}, a phase in
which charitable intervention finishes off the work of extermination.
[We are the consumers of the]{.underline} ever delightful [spectacle of
poverty and catastrophe, and of the moving spectacle of our own efforts
to alleviate it (which]{.underline}, in fact, [merely function to secure
the conditions of reproduction of the catastrophe market)]{.underline};
there, at least, in the order of moral profits, the Marxist analysis is
wholly applicable: we see to it that [extreme poverty is reproduced as a
symbolic deposit, as a fuel essential to the moral and sentimental
equilibrium of the West]{.underline}. In our defence, it might be said
that [this extreme poverty was]{.underline} largely [of our own making
and]{.underline} it [is]{.underline} therefore [normal that
we]{.underline} should [profit by it]{.underline}. There can be no finer
proof that the [distress of the rest]{.underline} of the world
[is]{.underline} at [the root of Western power and]{.underline} that
[the spectacle of that distress is its crowning glory than the
inauguration,]{.underline} on the roof of the Arche de la Defense, with
a sumptuous buffet laid on by the Fondation des Droits de l\'homme, of
an exhibition of the finest photos of world poverty. Should we be
surprised that spaces are set aside in the Arche d\' Alliance, for
universal suffering hallowed by caviar and champagne? [Just as the
economic crisis of the West will not be complete so long as it can still
exploit the resources of the rest of the world, so the symbolic crisis
will be complete only when it is no longer able to feed on the other
half\'s]{.underline} human and natural [catastrophes]{.underline}
(Eastern Europe, the Gulf, the Kurds, Bangladesh, etc.). [We need this
drug, which serves us as an aphrodisiac and hallucinogen]{.underline}.
And [the poor countries are the best suppliers - as]{.underline},
indeed, [they are of other drugs]{.underline}. [We provide
them]{.underline}, [through our media]{.underline}, [with the means to
exploit this paradox]{.underline}ical resource, just [as]{.underline}
[we give them the means to exhaust their natural resources with our
tech]{.underline}nologies. [Our]{.underline} whole [culture lives off
this catastrophic cannibalism,]{.underline} relayed in cynical mode by
the news media, and [carried forward in moral mode by our humanitarian
aid]{.underline}, which is a way of encouraging it and ensuring its
continuity, [just as economic aid is a strategy for perpetuating
under-development]{.underline}. Up to now, [the financial sacrifice has
been compensated a hundredfold by the moral gain]{.underline}. But [when
the catastrophe market itself reaches crisis point, in accordance with
the implacable logic of the market, when distress becomes scarce or the
marginal returns on it fall from overexploitation, when we run out of
disasters from elsewhere or when they can no longer be traded like
coffee or other commodities, the West will be forced to produce its own
catastrophe for itself]{.underline}, in order to meet its need for
spectacle and that voracious appetite for symbols which characterizes it
even more than its voracious appetite for food. [It will reach the point
where it devours itself. When we have finished sucking out the destiny
of others, we shall have to invent one for ourselves]{.underline}. The
Great Crash, [the symbolic crash, will come in the end from us
Westerners]{.underline}, [but only when we are no longer able to feed on
the hallucinogenic misery which comes to us from the other half of the
world]{.underline}. Yet they do not seem keen to give up their monopoly.
The Middle East, Bangladesh, black Africa and Latin America are really
going flat out in the distress and catastrophe stakes, and thus in
providing symbolic nourishment for the rich world. They might be said to
be overdoing it: heaping earthquakes, floods, famines and ecological
disasters one upon another, and finding the means to massacre each other
most of the time. [The \'disaster show\' goes on without any let-up and
our sacrificial debt to them far exceeds their economic
debt]{.underline}. The misery with which they generously overwhelm us is
something we shall never be able to repay. The sacrifices we offer in
return are laughable (a tornado or two, a few tiny holocausts on the
roads, the odd financial sacrifice) and, moreover, by some infernal
logic, these work out as much greater gains for us, whereas our
kindnesses have merely added to the natural catastrophes another one
immeasurably worse: the demographic catastrophe, a veritable epidemic
which we deplore each day in pictures. In short, there is such
distortion between North and South, to the symbolic advantage of the
South (a hundred thousand Iraqi dead against casualties numbered in tens
on our side: in every case we are the losers), [that one day everything
will break down]{.underline}. One day, [the West will break down if we
are not soon washed clean of this shame, if an international congress of
the poor countries does not very quickly decide to share out this
symbolic privilege of misery and catastrophe]{.underline}. It is of
course normal, since we refuse to allow the spread of nuclear weapons,
that they should refuse to allow the spread of the catastrophe weapon.
But it is not right that they should exert that monopoly indefinitely.
In any case, [the under-developed are only so by comparison with the
Western system and its presumed success.]{.underline} In the light of
its assumed failure, they are not under-developed at all. They are only
so in terms of a dominant evolutionism which has always been the worst
of colonial ideologies. The argument here is that there is a line of
objective progress and everyone is supposed to pass through its various
stages (we find the same eyewash with regard to the evolution of species
and in that evolutionism which unilaterally sanctions the superiority of
the human race). In the light of current upheavals, which put an end to
any idea of history as a linear process, there are no longer either
developed or under-developed peoples. Thus, to encourage hope of
evolution - albeit by revolution - among the poor and to doom them, in
keeping with the objective illusion of progress, to technological
salvation is a criminal absurdity. In actual fact, it is their good
fortune to be able to escape from evolution just at the point when we no
longer know where it is leading. In any case, a majority of these
peoples, including those of Eastern Europe, do not seem keen to enter
this evolutionist modernity, and their weight in the balance is
certainly no small factor in the West\'s repudiation of its own history,
of its own utopias and its own modernity. It might be said that the
routes of violence, historical or otherwise, are being turned around and
that the viruses now pass from South to North, there being every chance
that, five hundred years after America was conquered, 1992 and the end
of the century will mark the comeback of the defeated and the sudden
reversal of that modernity. The sense of pride is no longer on the side
of wealth but of poverty, of those who - fortunately for them - have
nothing to repent, and may indeed glory in being privileged in terms of
catastrophes. Admittedly, this is a privilege they could hardly
renounce, even if they wished to, but [natural disasters merely
reinforce the sense of guilt felt towards them by the
wealthy]{.underline} -- by those whom God visibly scorns since he no
longer even strikes them down. One day it will be the Whites themselves
who will give up their whiteness. [It is a good bet that repentance will
reach its highest pitch with the five-hundredth anniversary of the
conquest of the Americas.]{.underline} [We are going to have to lift the
curse of the defeated - but symbolically victorious - peoples, which is
insinuating itself five hundred years later, by way of repentance, into
the heart of the white race.]{.underline} No solution has been found to
the dramatic situation of the under-developed, and none will be found
since their drama has now been overtaken by that of the overdeveloped,
of the rich nations. [The psychodrama of congestion, saturation, super
abundance, neurosis and the breaking of blood vessels which haunts us -
the drama of the excess of means over ends -- calls more urgently for
attention than that of penury, lack and poverty]{.underline}. That is
where the most imminent danger of catastrophe resides, in the societies
which have run out of emptiness. [Artificial catastrophes]{.underline},
like the beneficial aspects of civilization, [progress much more quickly
than natural ones]{.underline}. The underdeveloped are still at the
primary stage of the natural, unforeseeable catastrophe. We are already
at the second stage, that of the manufactured catastrophe - imminent and
foreseeable - and we shall soon be at that of the pre-programmed
catastrophe, the catastrophe of the third kind, deliberate and
experimental. And, paradoxically, it is our pursuit of the means for
averting natural catastrophe - the unpredictable form of destiny - which
will take us there. Because it is unable to escape it, [humanity will
pretend to be the author of its destiny. Because it cannot accept being
confronted with an end which is uncertain or governed by fate, it will
prefer to stage its own death as a species.]{.underline}

[In a world marked by the overflow of information]{.underline}, it is
worryingly easy to feel confused and cognitively paralyzed. French
philosopher and social theorist Jean Baudrillard can help us understand
the universe of media. From politics to art to love, [the hyperreality
of the technological medium has reached every sphere of human
life]{.underline}. His philosophy is one which argues just how [signs
and symbols permeate our existence in the age of media]{.underline}.
Jean Baudrillard: The philosopher of the media age [Jean
Baudrillard](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/baudrillard/)
(1929-2007) is one of the most influential philosophers of the 20th
century. Although he is most commonly associated with postmodernism, the
roots of his philosophy are Marxist. In The System of objects (1968), he
provides a critical analysis of consumer society, in which [objects lose
their intrinsic value at the expense of their exchange
value]{.underline}. [This leads to [commodity
fetishism](https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110810104638104)]{.underline}:
the lay religion centered on the purchase and [accumulation of goods
regardless of their use]{.underline}. However, [he
introduces]{.underline} a third important category: [sign
value]{.underline}. This element leads the Frenchman to break from
Marxism in 1973, with The Mirror of Production: in it, [he declares the
end of the modern era of material production and the coming of the
postmodern age based on the production of signs]{.underline}. But it is
Simulacra and Simulations (1981) that grants him a unique position in
the history of philosophy. This seminal text outlines how [the
production of signs]{.underline}, narratives, and images [in mass media
leads to the inability to perceive what is real]{.underline}. We live in
a world where [signs and symbols assume an independent existence and
exercise a great influence on our lives]{.underline}. [The spread
of]{.underline} television networks, cinema, and [media]{.underline}
reports [creates a situation in which the narration becomes]{.underline}
somewhat [independent from the narrated event]{.underline}. Baudrillard
warns us that [media are not merely means of communication]{.underline}:
[they are a mode of representation and simulation of
reality]{.underline}. In other words: [the medium is the
message]{.underline}. What does, however, the author mean by "simulacra
and simulations?" He outlines four types of images: Reflection of a
basic reality: what he calls the order of "good" appearance involves the
faithful representation of a real object/event. Perversion of a basic
reality: in the order of "evil" appearance, an object/event is portrayed
falsely or misrepresented. Mask of the absence of a basic reality: in
the order of "sorcery," the image pretends to represent a real
object/event, but it is a copy with no original. No relation to any
basic reality: in the order of pure simulation, there is no relation to
any original reality whatsoever. Signs merely connect to other signs
without a material referent. They are pure simulacra. (Baudrillard,
1983) We can think of 1-2 as belonging to the order of representation,
whereby an object can be depicted either accurately or falsely. For
instance, a landscape can be portrayed in a clear photograph (1), or
with the artificial addition of filters (2). Here lies the problem of
ideology and political propaganda. In 3-4, on the other hand, the
"sovereign difference" between the real and the simulation is under
question. [The simulacrum is a copy of]{.underline} a copy whose
relation with [the original has been]{.underline} so
[dissipated]{.underline} that it can barely be called a copy. Imagine,
for example, photocopying a book ten successive times (photocopy, then
photocopy of the photocopy, etc.). It will appear in such a different
form at the tenth photocopy to the point of being unreadable. [The
simulacrum]{.underline}, therefore, [has its own ontological autonomy as
a copy without a model]{.underline}. [The simulation bears a relation to
the imitated thing]{.underline}, though only
[superficially]{.underline}. Its "[sorcery]{.underline}" [consists of
masking the absence of an original]{.underline}: [while there can be a
resemblance with it]{.underline}, the simulation has its own
independence. A videogame might well draw inspiration from some original
reality (e.g. Medieval Europe, 20th century Japan, etc.), but [the
simulated world does not actually have such a reality as its
referent]{.underline}. [The simulation is nothing but a set of
bits]{.underline} that appears to refer to an outside world, but it does
not. Thus, [it constitutes a world with its own independent
reality]{.underline}: in Baudrillard's words, [a
hyperreality]{.underline}.

#### Baudrillard's thought can only be understood posthumously -- all of their link offense is from decades ago which isn't representative today

Arthur Kroker: Jean Baudrillard was an immensely gracious, very warm and
intellectually curious person. As a scholar, he was somebody who thinks
about the world in social, cultural, political terms. He was acutely
insightful, perceptive and deeply knowledgeable. Jean [Baudrillard was a
prophetic historian of the future]{.underline}. I always think that
Baudrillard is a Nietzsche of our times in many ways. OM: Why Nietzsche?
AK: For two reasons. [Nietzsche]{.underline} said once that hi[s thought
would only be understood posthumously]{.underline}, that it will be only
understood by future generations who would live in the reality he had
prophesied. I think [it's]{.underline} really [the same with
Baudrillard]{.underline}. [The reality that he was
describing]{.underline} has [appeared]{.underline} now [and
will]{.underline} really [represent the structure of the 21st
century]{.underline}. OM: If Nietzsche's works were understood only
posthumously, what was the case with Baudrillard's works during his
lifetime? How did people perceive his works? AK: During his lifetime he
was immensely influential on a very broad level, in the arts community,
in the popular press in North America, and certainly in the disciplines
of sociology, politics, philosophy, cultural studies and information
studies. Particularly in the artistic community, Baudrillard's works
were immensely and massively influential. OM: Could we say that Jean
Baudrillard is the brightest figure when it comes to the philosophy of
postmodernism? AK: The brightest figure? Sounds good, I think that's
very accurate. OM: What kind of an approach should people take to
studying his works? AK: There are many different approaches which are
appropriate. Jean Baudrillard intellectually influenced many different
people in many different ways. Baudrillard was a 'pataphysician in the
tradition of Alfred Jarry, and Alfred Jarry invented the science of
imaginary solutions. I always thought that all of Baudrillard's writings
were very much a 'pataphysics of the contemporary era. I think that [we
are living today in a world which is like the scheme formulated
by]{.underline} Jean [Baudrillard]{.underline} in some ways. Let me be
explicit about this in detail. [Baudrillard's thought provided
a]{.underline} deeply [prophetic survey of the present politics and
culture but also of the future and the past]{.underline}. He identified
four major tendencies in the future of our postmodern society. One of
them appears at the level of political economy. [He was]{.underline}
definitely [the]{.underline} first and [best in describing the
contemporary movement towards digital capitalism]{.underline}. [His
books]{.underline}, "The Mirror of Production" and "For a Critique of
the Political Economy of the Sign" [represented a significant break with
Marxism]{.underline} in [describing how we move beyond the]{.underline}
binary exchanges between [use]{.underline}-value [and exchange value to
the]{.underline} new era of [symbolic exchange]{.underline}. The process
of symbolic exchange [with its diffusion of sign-values]{.underline} are
a way of [describing the appearance of the contemporary culture of
simulation and]{.underline}, with that, [the]{.underline} inauguration
in the [economic sphere of]{.underline} digital
[capitalism]{.underline}. The second principle, I think is the essence
of Baudrillard's thought: the entire existence of the mass society that
we live in is driven by fatal death drives. Not a life principle but the
death drives as the primal instinct motivating technological society.
This is expressed in the accelerated hyper glittering, hyper seductive
language of digital reality itself, For Baudrillard, [the]{.underline}
'[perfect crime]{.underline}' [committed by digital
tech]{.underline}nology [is]{.underline} its [murder of the
reality]{.underline}-principle---the triumph of a technological society
which in its hygienic logic, its technological perfectibility, replaces
the ambiguity and uncertainties of material reality with the circulating
illusions of the hyper-real. Here, the ecstasy of catastrophe drives
society forward it represented the movement to a world, which has more
than an illusion, it is perfectly accelerated, perfectly hygienic,
technologically perfect. At the same time, it is continuously on the
verge of imminent collapse and it does periodically collapse. That's
what Nietzsche described as a death drive, and what Freud described as a
death instinct, and Baudrillard does the same. OM: Do I understand
correctly that [when we speak about]{.underline} the first [prophecy of
Baudrillard it is his insight that the economics and society totally
depend on sign]{.underline}, that the language of sign-values becomes
the overriding power? AK: Yes, definitely. OM: And could we paraphrase
the second principle as "death drive is ..." AK: the essence of the
language of contemporary technology. OM: Do these two premises
constitute the foundation of Jean Baudrillard's thought? AK: I would add
two more to these. The third principle I think is essential (especially
reading the original contribution of JB) --- his theory of simulation,
the theory that [reality has imploded into the era of the
hyperreal]{.underline}, where [things are more real than
real]{.underline}. I think [that]{.underline}'s a really profound
insight and [accurately describes the world]{.underline} in which [we
live in]{.underline} every dimension. Fourth, the principle of cultural
seduction. Seduction is very important because for JB seduction means
that everything has a moment of hidden reversibility within it. Imminent
and hidden reversibility. Things can change to their opposite states
immediately. And that accounts for their fascination, and their scandal,
and their imaginary possibilities.

[prophecy]{.underline}. [They are only its bad conscience]{.underline}
precisely [because in them something]{.underline} of ~~man~~
\[humanity\] [is]{.underline} immediately [realized, because they object
without pity to the \"political\" dimension of the revolution, which
is]{.underline} merely [the dimension of its final
postponement]{.underline}. [They are the equivalent]{.underline}, at the
level of discourse, [of the savage]{.underline} social [movements that
were born in a symbolic situation of rupture]{.underline} (symbolic \--
which means non-universalized, non-dialectical, non-rationalized in the
mirror of an imaginary objective history). This is why
[poetry]{.underline} (not Art) [was]{.underline} fundamentally
[connected only with]{.underline} the [utopian socialist

romanticism]{.underline},\" [and never with Marxism]{.underline} *as
such.* [It]{.underline} i[s because the content of
liberated]{.underline} ~~man~~ \[person\] [is]{.underline}, at bottom,
[of less importance than the abolition of the separation of the present
and the future]{.underline}. [The abolition of this form of
time]{.underline}, the dimension of sublimation, [makes it impossible to
pardon the idealists of the dialectic, who are]{.underline} at the same
time [the realists of politics]{.underline}. [For them]{.underline} the
[revolution must be distilled in history; it must come on
time;]{.underline} it must ripen in the sun of the contradictions. That
it could be there immediately is unthinkable and insufferable. [Poetry
and the utopian revolt have this radical presentness in common, this
denegation of finalities;]{.underline} it is [this actualization of
desire no longer relegated to a future liberation, but demanded here,
immediately, even in its death]{.underline} throes[, in the extreme
situation of]{.underline} life and [death. Such is]{.underline}
happiness; such is [revolution. It has nothing to do with the
political]{.underline} ledger book of the Revolution. [Contrary to
Marxist analysis which posits]{.underline} ~~man~~ \[[the
person]{.underline}\] [as dispossessed, as alienated and
relates]{.underline} ~~him~~ \[[them]{.underline}\] [to a
total]{.underline} ~~man~~ \[[person]{.underline}\][, a total Other who
is Reason and who is for the future (which is utopian, but in the bad
sense of the term), which assigns to]{.underline} ~~man~~ [\[humanity\]
a project of totalization, utopia]{.underline}, for its part, [would
have nothing to do with the concept of alienation]{.underline}. [It
regards every man and every society as already totally there, at each
social moment, in its symbolic exigency]{.underline}. [Marxism never
analyzes the revolt, or even the movement of society except as an
intricate ornament of the revolution, as a reality on the way toward
maturation]{.underline}. [This is a racism of perfection, of the
finished stage of reason]{.underline}. [It throws everything else into a
nothingness of things transcended]{.underline}. 115 [Marxism
is]{.underline} still [profoundly a philosophy, even its \"scientific\"
stage, through all that remains in it of a vision of
alienation]{.underline}. In terms of \"alienation,\" the other side of
\"critical\" thought is always a total essence that haunts a divided
existence. But [this metaphysics of the totality is not at all opposed
to the present reality of the division. It is complementary to
it]{.underline}. For the subject, [the prospect of
recovering]{.underline} ~~his~~ \[[their]{.underline}\] [transparence
or]{.underline} ~~his~~ \[[their]{.underline}\] [total \"use value\" at
the end of history is just as religious a vision as the reintegration of
essences]{.underline}. \"[Alienation\" remains the imaginary of the
subject, even of the subject of history]{.underline}. [The subject will
not become again a total]{.underline} ~~man~~
\[[person]{.underline}\][;]{.underline} ~~he~~ \[[they]{.underline}\]
[will not rediscover himself; today]{.underline} ~~he~~ [\[they\] has
lost himself]{.underline}. [The totalization of the subject is still the
end of the end of the political economy of consciousness, confirmed by
the identity of the subject, just as political economy is confirmed by
the principle of equivalence]{.underline}. [Instead of
deluding]{.underline} ~~men~~ [\[people\] with a phantasm of their lost
identity, of their future autonomy, this notion itself must be
abolished. What an absurdity it is to pretend that]{.underline} ~~men~~
[\[people\] are \"other,\" to try to convince them that their deepest
desire is to become \"themselves\" again]{.underline}!
[Each]{.underline} ~~man~~ [\[person\] is totally there at each
instant]{.underline}. Society also is totally there at each instant.
Courderoy, the Luddites, Rimbaud, the Communards, the people of the
savage strikes, those of May, 1968 \-- [in every case the revolution
does not speak indirectly; they are the revolution, not concepts in
transit]{.underline}. [Their speech is symbolic and it does not aim at
an essence]{.underline}. In these instances, [there is speech before
history,]{.underline} before [politics,]{.underline} before
[truth,]{.underline} speech before the [separation and the future
totality.]{.underline} ~~He is~~ \[They are\] [truly a revolutionary who
speaks of the world as non-separated. There is no possible or
impossible]{.underline}. The utopia is here in all the energies that are
raised against political economy. But [this utopian violence does not
accumulate; it is lost. It does not try to accumulate itself as does
economic value in order to abolish death]{.underline}. [It does not
grasp for power]{.underline}. [To enclose the \"exploited\" within the
single historical possibility of taking power has been the worst
diversion the revolution has ever taken]{.underline}. [One sees here to
what depths the axioms of political economy have undermined, pervaded
and distorted the revolutionary perspective. Utopia wants speech against
power and against the reality principle which is only the phantasm of
the system and its indefinite reproduction. It wants only the spoken
word; and it wants to lose itself in it]{.underline}.

[Cryptocurrencies]{.underline} and digital coins [have]{.underline} a
[floating reliance on future prestige]{.underline}. [Being an early
investor]{.underline} in something that [might acquire value in the
future]{.underline} [distils]{.underline} an air of [status]{.underline}
within the industry if and when the risk pays off. Cryptocurrencies wish
to disavow or even transcend conventional currency but are utterly
reliant on such currencies as a reference in order to describe how they
work to prospective investors. Despite their libertarian rhetoric, in
practice, the jackpot for a cryptocurrency is to demonstrate its
popularity amongst a core base of early investors such that it may be
considered a viable option for established financial houses: selling the
glamour of revolution with the security of the state. [The symbolic
value of these products]{.underline}, [rather than their immediate
value]{.underline}, [calls to mind]{.underline} the work of 'father of
postmodernism', French sociologist and cultural theorist Jean
[Baudrillard]{.underline}, who wrote in his essay 'For A Critique of the
Political Economy of the Sign': Far from the primary status of the
object being a pragmatic one which would subsequently come to
overdetermine a social value of the sign, it is [the sign exchange
value]{.underline} (valeur d'echange signe) which [is
fundamental]{.underline} -- use value is often no more than a practical
guarantee (or even a rationalisation, pure and simple) \[...\] [An
accurate theory of objects will]{.underline} not [be established
upon]{.underline} a theory of needs and their satisfaction, but upon a
theory of [social prestation and signification]{.underline}.
[Baudrillard]{.underline}'s intervention into the value debate between
Marxist and liberal political economists [added a sociological dimension
to]{.underline} their competing [theorie]{.underline}s [of
value]{.underline}. Per Baudrillard, [objects are bought and displayed
as much for their sign-value]{.underline}, i.e. prestige or status, as
their use-value, and that [the]{.underline} phenomenon of [sign-value
has become an essential]{.underline} constituent [of
commodification]{.underline} and consumption in contemporary consumer
society. [This can be witnessed from early]{.underline} collections of
Fabergé eggs in [19th century]{.underline} Imperial Russia through [to
Gen-Z]{.underline}'s obsession [with]{.underline} [the]{.underline}
intentionally underproduced [Supreme brand]{.underline} -- everyone
wants to get in on "[the]{.underline} next big thing", and sometimes
that [next big thing has value based on hype rather than
utility]{.underline}.

#### Signs don't just determine the political economy -- they are the dominant determinant of every sphere of life

**Marshall 20** (Colin Marshall @ Open Culture - Based in Seoul, writes

Predicted the Simulation-Like Reality in Which We Live\", DOA:
6-23-2022, <https://www.openculture.com/2020/07/an-introduction-to-jean-baudrillard.html>)

Each and every morning, many of us wake up and immediately check on
what's happening in the world. Sometimes these events stir emotions
within us, and occasionally we act on those emotions, which raise in us
a desire to affect the world ourselves. But does this entire ritual
involve anything real? While performing it [we don't experience the
world]{.underline}, but [only media]{.underline}; when we respond, [we
respond]{.underline} not with action in the world, but only [with action
in media]{.underline}. [We]{.underline} have directly
[interact]{.underline}ed, to put it bluntly, [with]{.underline} nothing
more than [pixels]{.underline} on a screen. This condition has
pitilessly intensified in our era of smartphones and social media, and
though philosopher and sociologist [Jean
Baudrillard](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/baudrillard/) died three
months before the introduction of the iPhone, nothing about it would
surprise him. Assembled in an ominous, vintage stock footage-heavy style
reminiscent of Adam Curtis (he of The Century of the Self and
HyperNormalisation), the [half-hour Then & Now video essay
above](https://youtu.be/1Yxg2_6_YLs) provides an introduction to
Baudrillard's ideas, especially those that predicted the world in which
we live today, a "hyperreal postmodern" one filled with signs
referencing little that actually exists. "[In the run-up to the 2008
crash]{.underline}," the narrator reminds us, "[the real value of
mortgages was hidden under layers of sign value]{.underline}, under
deceitful insurance policies and financial ratings based on nothing." On
the news, "[it doesn't matter what's real]{.underline}. [What matters
is]{.underline} how it's said, [who says it]{.underline} --- the
perspective, whether it will be provocative enough, whether it will
entertain." [We live]{.underline}, in sum, [in a]{.underline}
"[postmodern carnival]{.underline}" where "things like reality TV,
Disneyland, and Facebook define our lives." Baudrillard saw this
happening nearly 40 years ago: "[People no longer look at each
other]{.underline}, but [there are institutes]{.underline} for that," he
writes in [Simulacra and Simulation](https://amzn.to/3fgiYOu). "[They no
longer touch each other]{.underline}, but [there is
contactotherapy]{.underline}. They no longer walk, but they go jogging,
etc. [Everywhere one recycles lost faculties]{.underline}, or lost
bodies, or lost sociality, or the lost taste for food." He credited
Marshall McLuhan, fellow gnomic observer of late 20th-century society,
with "one of the defining axioms of postmodern life." When McLuhan
declared that "[the medium is the message]{.underline}," says the
narrator, he saw that "[what mattered]{.underline} in this new world was
not what was real and material, but [what was represented as
signs]{.underline}: in short, television, and now the computer screen,
has come to dominate social life. [Sign production has replaced material
production as the organizing principle of political
economy]{.underline}." What would Baudrillard make of a production like
HBO's Chernobyl, whose painstaking reconstruction of historical events
[we previously featured here on Open
Culture](http://www.openculture.com/2019/06/scenes-from-hbos-chernobyl-v-real-footage-shot.html)?
What made that show a spectacle, says the narrator, was that "the
depiction was more real than the event itself: costumes, props, special
effects, and the perfect angle, the Geiger counter mapped onto the score
already overdetermined by signs." And so, "in twenty years' time we
think of Chernobyl, will we think of the real event, or images conjured
by TV studios?" But we need hardly look that far into the future. The
very things our screens insist to us are happening in the world right
now, far beyond the walls of the homes fewer and fewer of us leave these
days --- what do we truly know of their existence apart from this
digital blizzard of signs? If Baudrillard were alive to hear our
speculation about [the possibility that we live in another being's
simulation](http://www.openculture.com/2012/04/the_medium_is_the_message.html),
he'd surely point out that [we've already created the simulation
ourselves]{.underline}.

#### All oppositional and dialectical strategies of resistance fight on a terrain demarcated in advance -- the system solicits this critique to efface that we are all complicit 

**Pawlett 14** (William Pawlett @ IJBS - University of Wolverhampton,

[While such attitudes of indifference may seem to accept that there is
no meaningful alternative to capitalism]{.underline}: [an attitude that
has been called 'capitalist nihilism']{.underline} (Davis in Milbank and
Zizek, 2009) and 'capitalist realism' (Fisher 2008), Baudrillard's
notions of "integral reality", duality and complicity may have
significant advantages over those approaches. [Unlike thinkers who
remain anchored to critical thinking defined by determinate
negation]{.underline}, [Baudrillard's approach emphasises
ambivalence]{.underline}, reversal and both personal and collective
modes of rejection more subtle than those envisioned by the increasingly
exhausted mechanisms of critique. [The critique of consumer capitalism
-- the consumption of junk food]{.underline}, [junk entertainment and
junk information -- is now integral to the system]{.underline}; [the
critique of finance capitalism -- banker's bonuses]{.underline},
[corporate tax avoidance -- is integral to the system]{.underline}, yet
it fails to bring about meaningful or determinate social transformation.
Indeed, such critiques may do no more than provide the system with a
fleeting sense of "reality" -- real issues, [real problems to deal with
-- around which the system can reproduce its simulacra]{.underline},
[perhaps to reassure us that "something is being done", "measures are
being put into place" etc]{.underline}. "Reality" cannot be
dialectically negated by critical concepts when both 'reality' and the
critical concept disappear together, [their fates clearly tied to each
other]{.underline} (Baudrillard 2009b: [10-12). There is a sense then in
which the production of critique is in complicity with the
system]{.underline}, [the unravel-able proliferation and excess of
critical accounts of the system has the effect of protecting the
system]{.underline}. [Complicity consists in a sharing of the
denigration of all values]{.underline}, [all institutions]{.underline},
[all ideas]{.underline}, [all beliefs]{.underline}: [so long as we
believe in nothing -- at least not passionately -- then the system has
us]{.underline}, at least superficially. For example, [in recent decades
we have seen the denigration of religious faiths -- or their reduction
to 'cultural identity' and 'world heritage' objects]{.underline}; the
denigration of public services and welfare provision accompanied by
their marketisation; [the denigration of the poor]{.underline}, [the
young]{.underline}, [immigrants and the unemployed]{.underline}. [Yet
this is not only the denigration of the powerless or
disenfranchised]{.underline}, there is also the widespread denigration
of those seen as powerful: politicians, corporations, celebrities. For
Baudrillard, it is quite inadequate to focus only on the power of global
neo-liberal policies such as marketisation in these processes of
denigration. This is where Baudrillard's position departs decisively
from anti-globalists and from neo-Communists such as Negri, Zizek, and
Badiou. Global power has deliberately sacrificed its values and
ideologies, it presents no position, [it takes no stand]{.underline},
[it undermines even the illusion that "free markets" function and has
made "capital" virtual]{.underline}; become orbital it is removed from a
terrestrial, geo-political or subjective space. [These are protective
measures enabling power to become]{.underline} (almost) hegemonic
(Baudrillard 2009a: 33-56; 2010: 35-40).

#### All of their evidence relies on an understanding of capitalism that has disappeared whereby the sign no longer designates anything at all -- the age of the financial simulacram incorporates all [materialist]{.underline} responses to the system -- only our symbolic resistance can collapse the system

designates anything at all. It approaches its true structural limit
which is to refer back only to other signs. All reality then becomes the
place of a semiurgical manipulation, of a structural
simulation"]{.underline} (Baudrillard, 1975: 128). [A financial
bubble]{.underline}, viewed through a Baudrillardian lens, [can be
conceived as one such simulation.]{.underline} It is becoming routine in
discussions of Baudrillard to note the uncanny nature of how his thought
anticipates and seems to predict future developments: "the prefigurative
qualities of Baudrillard's writing are, now, self-evident" (Noys, 2012).
[Problems with the symbolism of the disentangling of the gold-standard
are emblematic and the seeds of the current crash are planted in the
early 1970s.]{.underline} Baudrillard notes, in 1973, that [this process
culminates in the 'virtual international autonomy of finance capital',
in the uncontrollable 'play of floating capital'.]{.underline} [When
financial capital is extracted from 'all productive cautions', and even
from 'all reference to the gold standard', then 'general equivalence'
becomes the strategic place of the manipulation: "Real production is
everywhere subordinated to it.]{.underline} [This apogee of the system
corresponds to the triumph of the code]{.underline}" (Baudrillard, 1975:
129). Here, in a characteristic motif, [the economic real]{.underline}
(of production for instance) [is subordinated to economic
simulation]{.underline}: [simulation becomes more real than the real
(hyper-real).]{.underline} [The code now becomes the greater political
problem than alienation, exploitation, inequality, and so
on.]{.underline} [The financial simulacrum should not be taken as having
no effect on everyday economic life: the code, the model, precedes the
real. The economy is hence forth considered hyper-real.]{.underline}
Elton McGoun uses Baudrillard\'s notion of hyper-reality in his study of
intrinsic value. [The simulation-model and virtual market comes to
determine the real economy itself: "decisions affecting production and
employment are made on the basis of stock prices, and not on the basis
of production and employment"]{.underline} (Elton, 1997: 113) The
following conclusion is reached: [it is not the 'real economy' that
shapes reality but activity in the financial economy.]{.underline} ["The
financial economy is thereby more real than the real economy itself**;**
it is a hyper-real economy]{.underline}" (Ibid.). [This results in a
financial simulation which consists of an exchange sphere without any
reference to economic reality]{.underline}. [It is an
internal]{.underline} (virtual) [exchange with no referent.]{.underline}
The sophistication of the financial simulacrum tends to reduce the
degree of materiality of the financial reality. Schinckus explains [the
evolution from commercial fairs to financial markets, whereby "the goods
were not exposed anymore and the transactions (on paper) became
symbols"]{.underline} Schinckus, 2008: 1086. [Finance has]{.underline}
largely [abandoned its role of raising capital or supporting
entrepreneurial activity]{.underline} (with subsequent variants of
exploitation) [and is now almost totally dedicated to
speculation]{.underline}. [Orléan evokes the 'virtual character' of
finance to describe this disconnection with the sphere of
production]{.underline} (Orléan, 1999). Schinckus uses Baudrillard to
tease out some of the consequences of the move to e-finance and the
technological virtualization of the financial market. [The emergence of
automatic trading and the creation of electronic financial products have
profoundly modified the organisation of the markets and financial
exchanges themselves.]{.underline} [The 'Iowa Electronic
Market']{.underline}, created in 1988, [was the first virtual market
where all interactions took place online.]{.underline} [Oral negotiation
has been superseded by an abstract sociability whereby traders only
interact via computer screens.]{.underline} [Wolfe describes traders
"trying to monitor six screens at once, six screens that fan out three
over three, obscuring any connection we have to the real
world"]{.underline} (Wolfe, 2013: 27). [This]{.underline} [leads to a
\'screen sociability\']{.underline} [which sees traders "personify their
screen by giving them a hypothetical personality"]{.underline}
(Schinckus, 2008: 1081). Often stock market transactions (or rather
risks) concern minute quantities, which may be just fractions of a per
cent. But when these are amplified into quantities of hundreds of
millions of dollars of shares these fractions soon add up. One might buy
a stock (any stock, it is immaterial -- and herein lies one of the very
problems) to hope to inflate the general share price and then sell
immediately and attempt to make an instant profit. Or vice versa, sell
then buy. Wolfe cites an early example from the pioneer Edward Thorp:
"He bets \$332.5m -- virtually one third of a billion -- on selling a
stock short -- and bets another third of a billion buying the same stock
to make a profit of one one-hundredth of 1%. Think of risking a total of
close to two thirds of a billion dollars to make \$2.5m! Sheer madness"
(Wolfe, 2013: 21). One effect of the emergence of quantitative trading
is that "It had nothing to do with any stock's or bond's value. It was a
purely mathematical way to game the markets" Ibid.). One issue with this
creation of a virtual market is the ambition to reach the idea of the
'perfect market' model seen only in economic theory textbooks. In this
case, "the finance reality has become a "hyper-reality" i.e. the image
of the theoretical reality that we have in mind" (Schinckus, 2008:
1082). [One trend of this desire to develop 'hard models' in finance has
been the rise of econophysics, whereby economists, physicists,
statisticians and computer specialists endeavour to apply models seen
and developed in physics to the market.]{.underline} In these instance
[financial quotations are studied as if they behaved]{.underline}, for
example, [like gas molecules.]{.underline} [These models then actually
shape the market by being transformed into computational algorithms to
price or hedge financial securities with the belief that returns will
behave like physical entities.]{.underline} [One prominent simulation
model]{.underline}, certainly influential in derivatives, [has been the
Black-Scholes formula]{.underline} published in 1973. [This was meant to
cut risk and scientifically legitimate the activities of options markets
around the world.]{.underline} [However]{.underline}, [over-reliance
upon the model, and its incorrect axioms]{.underline} (e.g. the
presupposition of negligible probability of extreme price change) [was
said]{.underline}, by the likes of NassimTaleb and Jean-Philippe
Bouchaud, [to spiral into the worldwide October 1987 crash. Capital
freed from regulation has no obstacle to circulation and value radiates
"endlessly in every direction"]{.underline} (Baudrillard, 1987: 25).
Recently, [trade in derivatives worldwide was one quadrillion US
dollars, which is ten times the total production of goods on the planet
over its entire history. This is one sense of what Baudrillard means by
'floating capital'. There is no anchor in real production or
wealth.]{.underline} Žižek has recently suggested that the stages in the
predominant mode of money seem to obey the Lacanian triad of
psychoanalytic concepts of the Real, Symbolic, and Imaginary. [Gold
functions as the Real of money (what it is 'really worth'); with paper
money we enter the Symbolic register (paper is the symbol of its worth,
worthless in itself); and, finally, the emerging mode is a purely
'Imaginary' one -- money will increasingly exist as a purely virtual
point of reference, of accounting, without any actual form, real or
symbolic (the 'cashless society']{.underline}) (Zizek, 2012: 101).
[Financial speculation is "without reference to production or its real
conditions]{.underline}\...[it plays now on its own orbital circulation
and revolution alone"]{.underline} (Baudrillard, 1998:1). [One
result]{.underline} of this [is the \'fictitious\' nature of
wealth]{.underline}, as Gérard Duménil and Dominique Lévy suggest in The
Crisis of Neoliberalism. For instance, [income is withdrawn against
asset bubbles, and there are claims made on future wealth that neither
can, nor will, be produced.]{.underline} [The signs engendered by the
financial simulation cannot fully be converted into real
wealth]{.underline}, as the market is currently experiencing. Duménil
and Lévy make the case that neoliberalism has less been an ideological
programme on behalf of free markets than a quest for more high income on
the part of the upper classes. This goes against the traditional
legitimisation of neoliberalism by positing old fashion greed against
liberty and free-flowing markets. In true 'trickle-down' fashion,
however, this quest for wealth and property also appeals to the
middle-class and the poor. [Subprime lending was the attempt to extend
to ordinary consumers "through rising home prices]{.underline}
\[consumer debt, student loans, credit, etc.\], [a fictitious income
long enjoyed by the financial classes]{.underline}. [The scheme could
hardly last"]{.underline} (Kunkel, 2012: 28). This is congruent with the
claim by Angela Mitropolous and Melinda Cooper that [the crisis was
generated by "usury from below that extended beyond the limits which
were tolerable to capital"]{.underline} (Noys, 2010: 46). This is to say
that [the growth of the bubble accelerated and inflated into what The
Economist has called "the biggest bubble in history."]{.underline} For
Baudrillard, [the crisis was an always already coming implosion impacted
upon by the hyper-real economy and trans-economics of
speculation.]{.underline} [This is a flouting of the 'law' of value, of
the market, production, surplus-value, and the' very logic of
capital'.]{.underline} [The trans-economic develops into "a game with
floating, arbitrary rules, a jeu de catastrophe"]{.underline}
(Baudrillard, 2001: 1). Interestingly here, the crisis has come and
traditional political economy has come to an end, "but not at all as we
expected it to -- it will have ended by becoming exacerbated to the
point of parody" (Ibid.). [The financial crisis has emerged, the bubble
has burst, and we witness one of the biggest threats to capitalism and
neoliberalism thus far, through the exacerbation of
simulation.]{.underline} [This has not come about through radical
politics and not]{.underline} - as much as it would have been desirable
to be agents of change - [through critique, or dialectics, or rational
discussion, or insurrection, or event, or act, or the deconstruction of
political concepts, or long-term revolution, or instant
revolt]{.underline}, and so on. Baudrillard's argument is that [we need
to follow this process and exacerbate further the
contradictions]{.underline} [of the hyper-real economy to ensure its
demise]{.underline}. [If capital is now floating capital, then let us
let it float away.]{.underline} This is the parodic, ironic, and
ecstatic play of the processes often analysed under the rubric of
postmodern. Regarding the crisis [there is no transcendent critique at
play but immanent implosion.]{.underline} This resonates with the
theoretical manoeuvre that Benjamin Noys (2012) has identified as
'accelerationism.' Noys notes that there are those who argue for the
need to 'radicalise and deepen the tendencies' that led to the current
crisis: "The tendency now becomes the immanent radicalisation of
capital\'s own dynamic of deterritorialisation" (Noys, 2010: 51). For
Baudrillard, [this immanent implosion and exacerbation is "a way of
putting an end to the economy that is the most singular in style,
ultimately more original than our political utopias"]{.underline}
(Baudrillard, 1998: 2). [Ecstasy is the process in play rather than
dialectics.]{.underline} [The only revolution in things today is no
longer in their dialectical transcendence]{.underline} (Aufhebung), [but
in "their potentialization, in their elevation to the second power, in
their elevation to the Nth power, whether that of terrorism, irony, or
simulation"]{.underline} (Baudrillard, 1990: 63). Baudrillard proposes
that [it is from the inside, by overreaching themselves, "that systems
make bonfires of their own postulates, and fall into ruins]{.underline}"
(Baudrillard, 2001: 6). [This is the fate that]{.underline} arguably
[awaits the exacerbation of neoliberal capital. Rather than confront
power, one must use power against itself.]{.underline} As Baudrillard
cites as a preface in Forget Foucault, "[As in judo, the best answer to
an adversary manoeuvre is not to retreat, but to go along with it**,**
turning it to one's own advantage]{.underline}" (Baudrillard, 1987). In
a methodological consideration Baudrillard writes that [the only
justification for thinking and writing is that it accelerates these
terminal processes.]{.underline} "[Here, beyond the discourse of truth,
resides the poetic and enigmatic value of thinking"]{.underline}
(Baudrillard, 2000: 83). [Exacerbation is a radical form of Daoism, a
going with the flow, not offering resistance but letting the power of
the system destroy itself.]{.underline} [This is]{.underline} certainly
counter intuitive and a novel proposition but is perhaps [better placed
than the attempt to confront a vastly more powerful opponent
head-on]{.underline}, [or to attempt make an absurd system moral or
regulated.]{.underline} Neoliberalism and its "democratic dictatorship
is shaping up nicely," Baudrillard claims(Baudrillard, 1997: 149). If
this is the case then ultimately, for Baudrillard, [we are to challenge
this from the realm of the symbolic.]{.underline} [The economic and
semiotic system suppresses and is built upon the denial of the symbolic:
one must "therefore displace everything into the sphere of the
symbolic]{.underline}, [where challenge, reversal and overbidding are
the law]{.underline} "(Baudrillard, 1993: 136). Is this principle of
exacerbation, which is witnessed in the escalation and overbidding of
('primitive') potlatch competition that Baudrillard frequently return
to, going to be effective in the ruination of neoliberalism? It is at
moments like the socio-economic present that we are most likely to find
out.

#### Their class struggle alternative is reliant on a universalist rationalism demarcated on the terrain of the bourgeoisie 

**Baudrillard 73** (Jean Baudrillard @ Telos Press - French sociologist,
philosopher and cultural theorist, Published: 1973, \<IKS\> \"The Mirror
of Production\", DOA: 6-21-2022, pg. 157)

[In the guise of historical materialism]{.underline}, [the idealism of
production ends by giving a positive definition to the revolutionary
class]{.underline}. [The class is then defined in the
universal]{.underline}, [according to the universality of labor
power]{.underline}. [It falls back upon an essence which in fact it was
assigned by the bourgeois class and which defines it]{.underline}, in
its historical being, [by the universality of capital]{.underline}.
[Capital and labor power then encounter each other as respective
values]{.underline}, [equally founded in the universal]{.underline}. 108
In this encounter of classes where each has its objective, historical
reference, [the bourgeois class always prevails]{.underline}. [For this
concept of class belongs to it and when it succeeds in trapping the
proletariat in it]{.underline}, [it has already won the
game]{.underline}. [The concept of class is a universalist and
rationalist concept]{.underline}, [born in a society of rational
production and of the calculation of productive forces]{.underline}. [In
a sense]{.underline}, there has always been and there will always be
only one class, [the bourgeoisie]{.underline}. [This capitalist
bourgeois class is defined not only by the ownership of the means of
production]{.underline}, [but by the rational finality of
production]{.underline}. [To make a class of the proletariat is hence to
enclose it in an order of definition]{.underline} (characterized by
\"[class consciousness]{.underline}\" as \"[the subject of history\")
109 in which the model remains that of the bourgeoisie]{.underline}.
[Accession to the status of class is equivalent to a rationalization of
the]{.underline} \"workers\' movement\" and its revolt, [equivalent to
aligning it in the general rationality of the industrial
order]{.underline}. Thus \"[class against class]{.underline}\" [can well
signify antagonism at the level of the relation to the means of
production]{.underline}, [but this in no way breaks the finality of
productivity itself]{.underline}. [On the contrary]{.underline}, but
dialecticizing it from within, [this schema serves only to extend the
process of political economy to infinity]{.underline}. [If the class
struggle has a meaning]{.underline}, [it is not in the encounter of one
class with another]{.underline}. ([When the structure is reversed and
the proletarian class triumphs]{.underline}, [as in the
East]{.underline}, nothing changes profoundly, as we know, [in social
relations.) This meaning can only be the radical refusal of letting
itself be enclosed in the being and consciousness of class]{.underline}.
[For the proletariat]{.underline}, [it is to negate the bourgeoisie
because the latter assigns it a class status]{.underline}. [It must not
negate itself insofar as it is deprived of the means of
production]{.underline} ([which is]{.underline}, unfortunately,
[the]{.underline} \"objective\" [Marxist definition of class); it
negates itself insofar as it is defined in terms of production and
political economy]{.underline}. [Can the proletariat have a meaning if
it defines itself in terms of productive forces]{.underline},
[labor]{.underline}, historical rationality, etc.? Evidently not. In
this framework, [the proletariat]{.underline} ([or any other possible
class]{.underline}) [is pledged to enter into the rational dialectic of
a form and a content]{.underline} ([on the one hand]{.underline}, [the
structure of classes]{.underline}, [on the other]{.underline}, [its own
class values]{.underline}, [when these are not its class]{.underline}
\"[interests\"!). It is pledged to a finality of class that perfectly
encloses it in the dialectical game of capitalist society]{.underline}.
[Better still]{.underline}, by reinforcing itself in its being, [in
proportion to the development of the class struggle]{.underline}, [it
reinforces the power of the ruling class]{.underline}, [and its degraded
opposition serves the reformist impulse of the capitalist
system]{.underline}, [when it does not reveal itself as even more
conservative in the realm of values]{.underline}. [This is where we are
today]{.underline}. [To what can we impute the historical blockage of
the]{.underline} \"revolutionary double negation\" ([the proletariat was
well-born from the bourgeoisie]{.underline}, [but it has not been born
of itself as a class)? Lenin]{.underline}, even Stalin, [the demise of
the proletariat itself \-- are these dialectical accidents? Quite
simply]{.underline}, [the problem is the conjuncture of a revolutioanry
theory aiming at the abolition of classes]{.underline}, outlined by
Marx, [with a revolutionary subject]{.underline} ([the real and
historical class of salaried workers). One cannot even say that the
proletariat has slowly turned against itself]{.underline}. [It has
logically produced the substantialization of the social revolt in a
theoretically untranscendable class]{.underline}, [which was soon fixed
in its being by the organization]{.underline}. Starting from there, [the
proletarian class and Marxist theory began mutually to justify one
another and hence to neutralize each other]{.underline}. [And the
project of transforming life]{.underline}, [as much the demand of Marx
as that of the actual revolt]{.underline}, [has placidly become the
victory of the proletariat]{.underline}.

#### Their attempt to map the reality of Western notions of industrialized production against the entire world reveals a violent ethnocentric racism that invalidates their theory, as it demonstrates the political economy only works as a diagnostic for a very short period of history and has no way of thinking that which is outside it

\"[The idea that in all societies the relations of
production]{.underline}, [and consequently]{.underline}, politics, law,

separable]{.underline}; [it is to extrapolate to the totality of history
the structuration of our own society]{.underline}, [which is inevitably
meaningless outside of it.\" This summarizes the critique that we have
made]{.underline}, [in the sense that it aims less at the contents of
the analysis than at the form]{.underline}, [less at any particular
conclusion than at the]{.underline} \"scientific\" tendency itself. [86
The dialectical structuring of categories which remain in a latent
state]{.underline}, [with its latent hierarchy placing the determinant
instance at the heart of the process of development]{.underline}, [as
separated functions]{.underline}, [as distinctive oppositions ruled by

incurable ethnocentrism of the code]{.underline}. [It is at this price
that]{.underline} \"materialist\" [analysis aspires to be a

that of its own code]{.underline}. [From the outset it labors in fact to
reproduce it]{.underline}, [while at the same time compressing its
object]{.underline}, [scotomizing it]{.underline}, [arming itself
against it with a whole system of defenses and
miscomprehensions]{.underline}. [It works in the imaginary like the man
who]{.underline}, [having lost his key in a dark alley]{.underline},
[looks for it in a lighted area because]{.underline}, [he
says]{.underline}, [that it is the only place where he could find
it]{.underline}. Thus, [historical materialism does not know how to
grasp earlier societies in their symbolic articulation]{.underline}. [It
only finds in them what it could find under its own light]{.underline},
[that is]{.underline}, [its artificial mode of production]{.underline}.
[This miscomprehension is not a peripheral or secondary
weakness]{.underline}. ([The deepest racist avatar is to think that an
error about earlier societies is politically or theoretically less
serious than a misinterpretation of our own world]{.underline}. [Just as
a people that oppresses another cannot be free]{.underline}, [so a

itself]{.underline}. [This is only another way of formulating Marx\'s
equation between the level of the analysis of contradictions and the
comprehension of the specificity of other societies.) In
effect]{.underline}, [the miscomprehension]{.underline}, moving from
societies \"[without history]{.underline}\" to archaic or feudal
formations, [nurtures a theoretical]{.underline}, [political and
strategic miscomprehension of capitalist formations
themselves]{.underline}. [It is a shortcoming of historical materialism
in accounting for the strategic configuration of modern societies which
echoes in its incapacity to account for the symbolic organization of
earlier formations]{.underline}. [And it does not help to say
that]{.underline} \"[it has other fish to fry.\" That is]{.underline},
[historical materialism has the critique of the capitalist economy and
its relations of production as its object and primitive
societies]{.underline}, kinship, [language and the
symbolic]{.underline}, are not its province. [Historical materialism
must be held responsible]{.underline}, by its own standards, [for the
carelessness and error that it perpetuates in all these domains for
through these miscomprehensions]{.underline}, [to which it is an
accomplice]{.underline}, [its own object then eludes it]{.underline}.
[It is the contradictions of this object]{.underline}, [repressed and
mystified]{.underline}, [that become the basis for analyzing historical
materialism rather than that which analyzes them]{.underline}. [It
therefore is not a matter of accidental or venal
shortcomings]{.underline}: [the repression of the symbolic nourishes all
the rationalist political illusions]{.underline}, [all the dreams of
political voluntarism]{.underline}, [that are born in the terrain of
historical materialism]{.underline}. [Along with Cardan one can offer
the still more radical hypothesis that not only have the categories of
historical materialism no meaning outside of our society]{.underline},
[but that perhaps in a fundamental way they no longer have any meaning
for us]{.underline}. [To the extent that they function at the interior
of our reality principle]{.underline}, [which is the principle of
separation]{.underline} ([this is where its analytic \--

us along the line of separation itself]{.underline}, [along this
fracture of the symbolic]{.underline}, along this place (or non-place:
utopia) beneath ([or beyond]{.underline}) [the economy and the internal
contradictions of the mode of production]{.underline}. Materialist
logic, [seeing only the contradictions that are accessible to
dialectical or structural schemas]{.underline}, [perhaps sees only the
symptoms]{.underline}, [at the interior of the system]{.underline}, [of
that rupture which founds the system itself]{.underline}. [The political
significance of this critique is that the struggle at the level of these
contradictions- symptoms does not touch their basis]{.underline}, [which
is separation]{.underline}. [This struggle is only an accomodation that
launches the well-known cycle of the extended reproduction of the
contradictions and the system itself]{.underline}. [The]{.underline}
\"dialectical\" [revolution in the order of the mode of production is
only perhaps the symptomatic discourse of the separation]{.underline}.
[Historical materialism prohibits itself from seeing this]{.underline}.
[It is incapable of thinking the process of ideology]{.underline}, [of
culture]{.underline}, [of language]{.underline}, [of the symbolic in
general]{.underline}. [It misses the point not only with regard to
primitive societies]{.underline}, [but it also fails to account for the
radicality of the separation in our societies]{.underline}, [and
therefore the radicality of the subversion that grows
there]{.underline}.

**By releasing the forces of production to reveal humanity\'s true
nature, the logic of the academy can't be overcome -- we must challenge
the system at the level of semiotics and code, or we will not challenge
it at all. The universal exchangeability of signifiers renders Marxist
analysis invalid because they are dissociated from signifiers.**

**Poster 75** (Mark Poster @ Telos Press - professor of European
intellectual history and media and cultural studies at the University of
California at Irvine, Published: 1975, \<IKS\> \"The Mirror of
Production, Translator's Introduction\", DOA: 6-21-2022, page 4)

[What is at stake in Baudrillard\'s critique of Marx is the
gravitational center of the system of political economy]{.underline}.
For Marx, [the primary place]{.underline} (determinant instance) [of
capitalism is in the structure of the means of production and the
relations of production]{.underline}. Over against political economy,
[which sought the deep structure of capitalism in the process of
exchange value]{.underline}, [in the determination of the price of the
commodity through the]{.underline} \"free\" [intercourse of demands and
supplies]{.underline}, [Marx shifted the center toward the]{.underline}
\"[real]{.underline}\" [act of the production and the consumption of
products]{.underline}. But for Baudrillard, [in both cases the real
logic is the same]{.underline}: [it is the investment of things with
value]{.underline}; [it is the placing of a sign on a thing and the
logic of this process of signification is the true essence of
capital]{.underline}. [The difference between Marx and political economy
is not as great as their agreement]{.underline}. [The Marxist critique
unmasked the]{.underline} \"abstractions\" [of exchange value in favor
of the]{.underline} \"concrete\" [processes of use value]{.underline},
[of production and labor]{.underline}. [But Marx\'s concepts were not at
all radical]{.underline}; [they did not reach the root of the
matter]{.underline}. [All Marx did was to set forth the repressed side
of the equations of political economy]{.underline}. [Instead of the
shadows of the market place]{.underline}, [we are sent to an equally
obscure underside of the system]{.underline}: [the place of
production]{.underline}. [Following this displacement of the center of
the system to its]{.underline} \"[human side,\" Marx unravelled the
threads of the entire social field through the]{.underline} \"[mirror of
production,\" at the same time unmasking the exploitative nature of the
system]{.underline}. [Instead of the]{.underline} \"justice\" [of
exchange equivalence]{.underline}, [we have the unjust extraction of
surplus-value fom the laborer]{.underline}, [or]{.underline},
alternatively, [the alienation of his life energies]{.underline}. [In
the process of Marx\'s analysis]{.underline}, however, [the social
sphere is filtered]{.underline}, inexorably, [through the concepts of
production and labor which become the unquestioned metaphysical
reference points of social reality]{.underline}. [The problem is not
that Marx is an economic determinist]{.underline}, [that he does not
value highly enough the]{.underline} \"finer\" [aspects of human
culture]{.underline}. [It is not a question of replacing a]{.underline}
\"materialist\" theory with an \"idealist\" one. Rather, [the problem is
that he did not penetrate the central logic of political
economy]{.underline}, which is, [to Baudrillard]{.underline}, [its logic
of signification]{.underline}. [Marx theorized the origin of political
economy as a transformation of the mode of production and relations of
production]{.underline}. [But there has been a second decisive change in
political economy that Marx did not recognize and this involved
a]{.underline} \"[process of social abstraction]{.underline}\" [that
refers not to the commodity but to the sign]{.underline}. [The chief
merit of Baudrillard\'s thought is to articulate a critique of the
political economy of the sign which he regards as the dominant social
form of advanced capitalism]{.underline}. [Political economy had
generated its mode of signification from the outset]{.underline},
[during the Renaissance]{.underline}, [but Marx was unable to theorize
this object because first]{.underline}, [like Ricardo and the
others]{.underline}, [he was tied to the mirror of
production]{.underline}, [and]{.underline}, second, because his
discourse, [like theirs]{.underline}, [was representational and hence
incapable of seeing the radically new form of social
exchanges]{.underline}. [Baudrillard employs the concepts of
contemporary structural linguistics to develop his
critique]{.underline}. [Structuralists break down the linguistic sign
into a signifier]{.underline} ([a language term]{.underline}), [a
signified]{.underline} (an intended meaning), [and a
referent]{.underline} ([an object pointed to by the signifier).
Structuralists merely theorize the signifier]{.underline}, [in search of
its systematic quality]{.underline}, [relegating the signified and the
referent to an obscure horizon of their science]{.underline}. [What they
have been able to do is to show that signifiers have become abstracted
from the subject]{.underline} ([the signified]{.underline}) [and from
the social world of objects]{.underline} ([the referent). While they
claim this situation is natural and inevitable]{.underline},
[Baudrillard argues that the essence of political economy is precisely
this separation]{.underline}; [the increasing autonomization of the
signifier not simply in the realm of language but in all aspects of
social exchange]{.underline}. [Marx foresaw that capitalism would
corrupt all values]{.underline}, moral, cultural, sexual, [etc., by the
force of the exchange value of the commodity]{.underline}. [Baudrillard
asserts that the strategy of the capitalist system is to generate this
abstract structure of signification of which the commodity is merely one
example]{.underline}. [What happens in political economy is
this]{.underline}: \"[the signified and the referent are now abolished
to the sole profit of the play of signifiers]{.underline}, [of a
generalized formalization where the code no longer refers back to any
subjective or objective \`reality]{.underline},[\' but to its own
logic]{.underline}. [The signifier becomes its own referent and the use
value of the sign disappears to the profit only of its commutation and
exchange value]{.underline}. [The sign no longer designates anything at
all]{.underline}. [It approaches in its truth its structural limit which
is to refer back only to other signs]{.underline}. [All reality then
becomes the place of a semilogical manipulation]{.underline}, [of a
structural simulation]{.underline}. [And whereas the traditional
sign\... is the object of a conscious investment]{.underline}, [of a
rational calculation of signifieds]{.underline}, [here it is the code
that becomes the instance of absolute reference.\" Here we are beyond
the stable bourgeois world of the nineteenth century where the consumer
carefully weighed his money against the value of the
commodity]{.underline}, [carefully estimated his need against his
resources]{.underline}. [This stable]{.underline}, comfortable,
[knowable world where words clearly referred to things]{.underline},
where ideas represented reality, [where values corresponded to
needs]{.underline}, where commodities had unquestioned value, [was the
world of Marx and his thought]{.underline}. [There could simply not be
articulated a]{.underline} \"revolution\" in underarm deodorants, [the
incorporation]{.underline} ([imaginary or real]{.underline}) [of
personal qualities through the purchase of commodities]{.underline}, [or
a]{.underline} \"[clean bomb.\" Baudrillard\'s critique of the sign
allows him to render the situation of advanced capitalism with much more
concreteness than traditional Marxism]{.underline}. [Whole realms of
contemporary protest]{.underline} (Blacks, Women, Youth, [etc.) and
critique]{.underline} (consumption, sex, [language]{.underline}, [the
media]{.underline}, [etc.) can be seen better in relation to the
repressiveness of the code than in relation to the mode of
production]{.underline}. [The dramatic tension in the system comes from
its difficulty in reproducing the code]{.underline}, [while production
itself becomes merely an ideological support of the system]{.underline}.
(It delivers the goods.)

[It became clear]{.underline}, however, [that the critical
base]{.underline}, the theoretical position, [from which Baudrillard
undertook his analyses was somewhat ambivalent]{.underline}. On the one
hand there is in this period a gesture to the importance of the
proletarian position. [There is also increasing reference to the
significance of an order higher than that of the semiotic
culture]{.underline}. He called this the \'symbolic order\', a more
radical if more primordial basis. [At first the symbolic order is
discussed with reference to the famous analysis of gift-exchange by
Marcel Mauss]{.underline} ([see Baudrillard]{.underline}, 1981,
originally 1972: 64ff.). This is an initial study, [the first of a long
series of oppositions between the symbolic and the semiotic
order]{.underline}. Thus it is essential to clarify the nature of these
two concepts. Of course this cannot be done definitively since many of
the concepts have been modified through the course of Baudrillard\'s
subsequent evolution. It is Baudrillard\'s own account of the sacred
culture defined by Durkheim in The Elementary Forms of the Religious
Life (1915), [it is that defined by Max Weber as the enchanted world of
traditional societies]{.underline}, [it is the fatalistic culture of
peasants]{.underline}. [For Baudrillard Marx was not sufficiently
radical in his analysis]{.underline}, it was not use-value which should
have been contrasted with exchange-value, but symbolic exchange which
should have been contrasted with commodity exchange. [Baudrillard\'s
reading of Marx suggests that his conception of communism was trapped
within the matrix of the cultural order of rationalisation and therefore
could not be other than its]{.underline} (bad) mirror-image. Like Mauss,
Baudrillard suggests the superiority of the symbolic order over the
semiotic order (the obligation of gift over the cash nexus) while
witnessing the apparent destruction of the former by the latter. Against
the Marxists, [Baudrillard appears more radical]{.underline}, [and more
primitive]{.underline}. [But there are surprises]{.underline}.
Baudrillard does not simply document the course of the destruction of
the symbolic order but analyses the ironic evolution of the semiotic
order itself. [If we turn to Symbolic Exchange and Death we can follow
the analyses of the ideological process]{.underline}. Chapter 1, [on
capitalism and production]{.underline}, is perhaps a crucial analysis.
It is curious in many respects. [It is written in a highly rhetorical
style]{.underline}, playful, wilfully malicious. Although the analyses
of simulation, [fashion]{.underline}, sexuality, death, [are likely to
be more celebrated]{.underline}, this first chapter in a sense is more
fundamental yet the text is both assertive, [dogmatic and at the same
time illusive]{.underline}. The writing is in the main unsupported by
any burden of evidence or any attempt at systematic argument, as if a
highly perverse dialectical mania had grasped the writer. [First of all
Baudrillard presents the thesis that in order to grasp the nature of
modern capitalism it must be thought of not as a mode of production but
as a code dominated by the \'structural law of value\']{.underline}.
This term is obviously developed from Marx\'s own law of value, [but
here it detaches itself from economics and becomes a mechanism which
invades all cultural spheres]{.underline}. [In other words all spheres
can be analysed as the process of the political economy of the
sign]{.underline}. [Baudrillard insists in fact that the development of
modern society is uneven]{.underline}, [and like Weber argues that the
process first attacks art]{.underline}, [politics and culture and then
the economy itself]{.underline}. The economy, after having passed
through a specific phase of simulation known as the capitalist mode of
production (the phase of the factory, [etc.), undergoes an ironic logic
since the mode of production inverts itself and begins to destroy the
very separations it was built upon]{.underline}. [Capital itself
proceeds to destroy the hierarchy of base and
superstructure]{.underline}, [of production and
reproduction]{.underline}, [of labour and capital]{.underline}. [There
are two steps in the argument which must be examined]{.underline}. The
first is the argument concerning the nature of the change of the terms
within the capitalist mode of production. [The second is the argument
concerning the relation between the symbolic order and
capitalism]{.underline}. The character of the former argument is perhaps
best grasped as process occurring at an already advanced stage of the
destruction of the natural economy of primitive symbolic exchange ([the
argument follows on from that presented in The Mirror of Production).
For Baudrillard the primitive society has no \'mode of
production\']{.underline}, [indeed perhaps industrial factory capitalism
is the only \'mode of production\' that has existed as
such]{.underline}. However, once the structural law of value attacks the
elements of the system the code becomes determinant, [ending any order
of causation between the spheres of production and
consumption]{.underline}. [Hence the historical dialectic between them
comes to an end]{.underline}. [Baudrillard produces the irony of the
Althusserian version of Marx which suggested that
reproduction]{.underline} (class struggle) was determinant in history,
[for Baudrillard suggests that when reproduction becomes dominant labour
and production change their sense]{.underline}, they lose their
finality, [that is]{.underline}, they lose their rationality as
purposeful work as they become reproduced for the sake of the
reproduction of work itself. [This idea reflects the great change that
has occurred in Western societies in relation to the meaning of the term
alienation]{.underline}. [When this happens all elements in the system
are affected as the proletariat is incorporated into the social
order]{.underline}; trade unions, [strikes]{.underline}, [revolts such
as May \'68 lose their claim to justice and radicality]{.underline}.
[Indeed the organisations and theoreticians who mark time with
insistence on the centrality of \'production\' and \'labour\' and those
who believe in \'the use-value of their labour power the proletariat are
virtually the most mystified and the least susceptible to this
revolt\']{.underline} (p. [30 below). Baudrillard reorganises the theory
of resistance and revolt from one based on internal system
contradiction]{.underline} ([Marx]{.underline}) [to that of exclusion
and excommunication]{.underline} (Durkheim and Mauss).

### **[Cold War Framing of Emerging Tech]{.underline}**

#### **Cold War framing of emerging technology simulates a bygone, bipolar era of stability to conceal the indeterminacy of the postmodern condition. This seduces individuals to a mode of informatic governance and to technological theater which allows nation states to pretend they are solving an issue without actually doing anything. It also justifies populist and nationalist modes of violence as a corrective to the indeterminacy of meaning. It is thus imperative for policy makers to think through our postmodern condition and to reject Cold War framing of emerging technology.**

It is hot to talk about a new Cold War, especially if you put cyber in
front of it. **[The new cyber Cold War concept is prominent in
discussions about geopolitics and Great Power
competition]{.underline}**1. Some2 have argued that the **[[Cold War
discourse frames competition and technological rivalry
between]{.mark}]{.underline}** states, mainly **[[the
US]{.mark}]{.underline}** and **[[China and]{.underline}]{.mark}** the
US and **[[Russia]{.mark}, in a way that fails to reflect the
complexities of current conflicts and dynamics of the original Cold
War]{.underline}**. **[This discours]{.underline}**e comes through in
policy and strategies, especially when referring to the governance of
cyber and emerging technologies. This **[raises questions
about]{.underline}** the security community itself and **[the
perceptions of policy and decision- makers]{.underline}** in this field.
Mainly, **[what exactly is so alluring about the Cold War that the
security community keeps coming back to it as a way to understand the
current state of conflict in the world?]{.underline}** More so, why is
it applied to cyber, including cyber operations, cyber-related
technologies, cyberspace, etc., with such conviction? This paper frames
the emphasis on a new Cold War as a hyperreality that is heavily focused
on technologies and the perceptions of their alleged uses in future
conflicts. By drawing on the works of Baudrillard and others, this paper
argues that **[[the current focus on Cold War discourse to frame the
security environment, and especially cyber, is based on a comfortable
imaginary reality that is knowable, ordered, and familiar]{.mark}. Yet,
[this reality is a simulation that is repeated again and again and
perpetuated by a focus on emerging technologies in the discourse as
embedded with geopolitics.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

This paper aims to present a complex exploration into the postmodern
framings of defence and security policy. This paper is structured as
such: first, the rationale of this paper is presented, emphasizing its
importance for policy and decision-makers and members of the security
community. After this, the 'postmodern condition' is described as it
relates to increasing uncertainty and disorder about the state of the
world (via Bauman). This uncertain condition is then linked to a
discussion about simulations of reality and hyperreality tied in with
emerging technologies. Following this, the seductions of free-market
capitalism are brought into discussion with the meaning-making discourse
that mirrors the dichotomies of the Cold War. This serves to articulate
further the linkages between seductions, capitalism, and the
fetishization of technologies. Baudrillard's (in)famous arguments in The
Gulf War Did Not Take Place (1995), and The Spirit of Terrorism and
Requiem for the Twin Towers (2002) are used to show how hyperrealities
become embedded in the discourse of the security community, especially
through a focus on emerging technologies. Baudrillard's arguments lead
to a discussion highlighting how this perception fetishizes technologies
and is perpetuated by myths based on capitalist and consumerist intents.
The last section discusses the current understanding of emerging
technologies and cyber in Canada from a military perspective in policy
language in Strong, Secure, Engaged: Canada's Defence Policy (2017)
(SSE). The paper concludes with a 'translation' of the discussion by
describing three tangible considerations for policy and decision-makers.

**IMPORTANCE OF METAPHORS AND ANALOGIES**

**[[A postmodern deep dive]{.mark} into cyber and emerging technologies
might seem beyond the scope of a policy audience]{.underline}**. Perhaps
it may seem too complex and abstract for consideration in decision-
making. **[However, it [is not]{.mark} as abstract or [removed from
policy and decision-making]{.mark} as one would assume.]{.underline}**
This is because **[[discourse can shape]{.mark} organization, practices,
methods, and strategy, or the 'reality' of
[policymaking]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

The **[discourse about cyber, including threats, security, and space,
shapes and is shaped by the definition of 'reality'.]{.underline}** Dunn
Cavelty (2013) shows that various actors, including state and non-state
actors, seek to assert themselves within this definition process. Part
of this process involves the use of metaphors and analogies.
**[Metaphors shape 'reality', what is 'known', or imagined, about
cyber.]{.underline}** For example, **[[imagining cyberspace as a
'frontier' associates the concepts of unruliness and lawlessness with
the need for order]{.mark} within this domain]{.underline}** (Dunn
Cavelty 2013). Sulek and Moran (2009) show how **[analogies, such as a
Cyber Pearl Harbour, cyber Cold War, and cyber 9/11, etc., can inform
future cyber strategies.]{.underline}** In their analysis of **[[the
cyber Cold War analogy]{.underline}]{.mark}**, Sulek and Moran (2009)
show that it **[[is "primarily anchored in the idea that powerful
nation-states are competing for influence and power without resorting to
a direct conventional or nuclear war"]{.mark} (]{.underline}**8).
Nevertheless, their comparison of the similarities and differences
between the 'actual' Cold War and a cyber Cold War does not adequately
explore the underlying fixations, spectacle, and seductions of this
period and how this shapes decision-making and strategy. What is needed
is a more nuanced understanding of why this analogy exists, its context,
and what it says about the security community's goals, fears, and
choices.

Although the threat environment has changed since the **[[Cold War,
narratives]{.underline}]{.mark}** drawing on this period **[still
[permeate policy and influence decision-making]{.mark}. These narratives
[frequently imply a level of certainty, calculability, and]{.mark}
relative [stability]{.mark} of an apparently bipolar
world]{.underline}**. **[[The intricacies]{.mark} [of current conflicts
and threats require a]{.mark}]{.underline}** more nuanced understanding,
and **[[a postmodern approach]{.underline}]{.mark}** may help the
security community better understand these complexities (Dunn Cavelty
and Mauer 2009). **[This means understanding and facing the 'new'
'cyber' Cold War discourse and its impact on cyber and defence strategy
for policy and decision-makers]{.underline}**. This process starts by
delving into the postmodern condition and the search for meaning and
stability.

**THE POSTMODERN CONDITION**

Modernity is characterized as a search for meaning, order, and
stability. Prior to the influence of globalization and neoliberalism,
this search was usually answered in the West by the state, church, and/
or family, whereby citizens found stability and identity. Large-scale
globalization and neoliberalism starting in the 1990s opened up the
world to the possibility of choice. It presented individuals with the
freedom to make meaning through their own choices. The corresponding
retreat of the state gave individuals a diversity of options to find
meaning, yet this freedom resulted in instability. According to Bauman
(1997), this **[[instability results from a sense of insecurity,
uncertainty, and the constant search for meaning outside of the
traditional channels]{.mark}. This is the postmodern condition,
specifically the power of other actors outside and including the state,
to control individuals' options for choice.]{.underline}** As a result,
**[[individuals are without traditional criteria for]{.mark} ascribing
[identity]{.mark} or achieving meaning in life.]{.underline}**

**[Thus, [they search elsewhere for meaning]{.mark}]{.underline}** and
new lifestyles. **[These identity-making and consumer- oriented options
are coloured with capitalism and aim to 'seduce' individuals into
consumerism to ease the overwhelming sense of uncertainty. This
uncertainty is fuelled by capitalistic dreams that can promise meaning
and fulfillment.]{.underline}**

In Liquid Life, Bauman (2005) characterizes postmodern life as a
constant struggle of reinvention and a search for meaning. This search
for meaning and purpose can be applied to any part of society whereby
the state's traditional role is in flux and new possibilities are
sought. Globalization has changed the interactions and organization
between people, and as a result, changed the constructs that
traditionally bind people to a state. **[The subsequent uncertainty, or
liquidity of meaning and belonging in the modern world, has led to many
responses by diverse actors outside of the traditional state-focused
approach.]{.underline}** Responses to this liquidity must mould tangible
meaning for individuals to choose; it must also provide **[[structure,
identity, meaning]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and **[[can be flavoured with
capitalism, or]{.underline}]{.mark}** as argued elsewhere (see Csenkey
2018), **[[populism and nationalism. States]{.mark} can [use
these]{.mark} flavours [to bolster state-serving
practises]{.mark},]{.underline}** for example, **[by [structuring fear
of the 'Other' in]{.mark} border security and national [security
policies]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Csenkey 2018; 2020; Bauman 2006). For
Bauman, individuals are left with no strings to grasp from the past as
they buy into these new capitalist dreams.

Unlike Bauman (2005), Baudrillard (1994) does not see globalization and
neoliberalism as the end of history (Fukuyama 1992) or identity. New
meanings and lifestyles are not necessarily new --- they can be
rebranded and sold in new ways with mixed flavours --- the 'old wine,
new bottles' approach. For Baudrillard, the postmodern condition
includes all ideas from the past. These ideas, however, are now
negotiable and are included in the mix of histories and simulations to
be seduced by.

**[The postmodern condition is essential to understand because it is
tied inextricably with the simulations that make postmodern life a
reality. Uncertainty about order, meaning, and the search for identity
and stability in a globalized world can be rebranded and sold as
answers. These answers can be crafted as realities]{.underline}**
(vis-a-vis Baudrillard). However, as we shall see, these realities are
simulations, and simulations of simulations, and simulations of the
real.

**SIMULATIONS OF THE REAL**

Simulations are reality without reality. The postmodern condition is
characterized by simulations and hyperrealities (recall Baudrillard).
These simulations and hyperrealities guide perceptions of reality,
including choices, identities, and governance practices.

Using Baudrillard's (1983) example, imagine the creation of a map. The
mapping of a territory, including drawing its borders, natural features,
and parcelling out associated sovereignty claims, is based on a reality.
This reality is based on geography, history, and the real world --- yet
it is only a simulation of the real. **[When the reality that the
simulation is based on is removed, all following reproductions are based
on the simulation itself. What is left is a 'hyperreality' or a
simulacrum]{.underline}**. Baudrillard describes this as **[a model of a
real without the original reality.]{.underline}** For Baudrillard:

"\[t\]he real is produced from miniaturized units, from matrices, memory
banks and command models - and with these, it can be reproduced an
indefinite number of times. It no longer has to be rational since it is
no longer measured against some ideal or negative instance. It is
nothing more than operational. In fact, since it is no longer enveloped
by an imaginary, it is no longer real at all. It is hyperreal: the
product of an irradiating synthesis of combinatory models in a
hyperspace without atmosphere." (1983: 3).

**[Hyperrealities are not duplicates or imitations of reality, nor are
they representations.]{.underline}** Representations assume that the
sign and the real are equivalent. **[Simulacrum, or hyperrealities, are
simulations of reality, reflections that mask or in some way pervert
reality.]{.underline}** It masks it in such a way that it does not look
like reality anymore and bears no relation. **[Cyber is a hyperreality
--- it is a simulation of the real.]{.underline}**

**Inscribing Reality, or how to Govern Technologies**

Cyber is a hyperreal space; it has intangible and tangible pieces, is
interacted by diverse users, technologies, and operates in different
contexts. **[From a military perspective, this is problematic. [The
liquidity of the postmodern condition affects military frameworks
because it creates uncertainty about structure, order, and
rationale.]{.mark}]{.underline}** This is further complicated by **[[the
plethora of actors,]{.underline}]{.mark}** including new adversaries and
their **[[motives and strategies]{.underline}]{.mark}**, operating in
this space. Additionally, **[[new technologies]{.mark},]{.underline}**
especially those outside of a defence context, are challenging to
govern. In combination, all of these factors **[[result in
instability]{.mark}.]{.underline}** One such way is to stabilize the
unstable, solidify the liquid uncertainty, and define reality through
inscription.

The complexity and uncertainty associated with cyber and emerging
technologies operating in this space can be made tangible, and therefore
governable through inscription. For Latour (1987), part of this process
is through inscription devices. Reality is made stable through the
inscription of meaning onto things and concepts. **[[When reality is
made stable, it]{.mark} is comparable, combinable; it [can be debated,
calculated, and diagnosed]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Part of **[this
inscription process involves making and using
information.]{.underline}** In Seeing Like a State, Scott (1998) argues
that [**[states craft ways to imagine the world as easier to
govern]{.underline}**.]{.mark} States do this **[[by making people,
processes, things, regions, etc. quantifiable]{.mark}, or easier to
govern through current systems.]{.underline}** For example, assigning a
person a SIN or giving areas of land postal codes. This, in turn,
modifies the perception of these 'things' and feeds into the design,
enforcement, and retention of governance through a specific lens. These
are inscription devices enabling information to be created about
concepts and things. **[This information is used and funnelled through
'centres of calculation' whereby it is understood in relation to other
information]{.underline}** (Latour 1987). **[In these centres of
calculation, the information is manipulated for use]{.underline}**,
including understanding its effects on other information.

Inscriptions accumulate, and this makes them powerful. The more
information is gathered, manipulated, computed, and used via centers of
calculation, the more legitimate they become. This information is
transformed into plans and strategies, whereby legitimacy, and therefore
power, is ascribed to those who seek to govern. **[When cyber-related
emerging technologies are inscribed with a reality through information
about them from a specific context, it makes them
governable]{.underline}**. This paper focuses on understanding the
realities cyber technologies are inscribed with and how and why they
seduce the security community.

**SEDUCTION: MARKETING IDENTITY AND MEANING**

Although 'free' to choose meaning and lifestyles, there is a perpetual
uncertainty about the world (Bauman 1997; 2005). Some of this
uncertainty is nested in technologies, their uses, users, capabilities,
contexts, etc. Globalization saw a decline in metanarratives and grand
theories, especially those held and perpetuated by traditional actors
like the state. Technologies can be seen as part of a regime of
globalization. **[Although there is anxiety about technologies, the
[associated narratives provide some]{.mark} recentering and [restoration
of meaning]{.mark} and choice]{.underline}**. For Baudrillard, **[this
is]{.underline}** power which he calls **[seduction,]{.underline}** and
**[it resides in the representation of the visible and invisible and
making it consumable. Society is organized around the logic of
consumption. Consumerism has brought some certainty and stability to the
liquid uncertainty of the globalized world. [One of the comforting
aspects of consumerism is that it is limitless]{.mark}]{.underline}**
(Baudrillard 1998 \[1970\]). This means that there are never-ending
promises and pleasures**[. Society's appetites will constantly grow and
seek new products as a consuming community]{.underline}**. In other
words, it is a society driven by consumerism (Bauman 1992) and a
postmodern world of simulations and hyperrealities (vis-a-vis
Baudrillard). The key to fulfilling and perpetuating these endless
consumeristic needs is through seduction, primarily through the
production of imagery and information.

According to Baudrillard (1990 \[1979\]), seduction is "the strategy of
appearance" (7, 8), including over imagery. Seduction supposes an order
of things based on something beyond reality, although it appears to
offer it. **[[The seduction of]{.mark} a reality that offers stability,
including familiar imagery, meaning, and aesthetics, drives the desire
to 'buy-in'.]{.underline}** The seduction of meaning through imagery was
on display in a newly 'experienced' way during the technology theatre of
the Gulf War.

**THE TECHNOLOGY THEATRE OF THE GULF WAR**

**[The Gulf War could be seen as a high-tech war, [a 'clean' war ---
where technologies]{.mark} were used to [engage in an efficient]{.mark}
and modern [conflict whereby the state with the most advanced
technologies would win and suffer less]{.mark}
casualties.]{.underline}** This would act as a deterrent to other
adversaries to engage in future conflicts. **[This high-tech [war was
seen and 'experienced' through new media,]{.mark} with new visuals and
aesthetics. 'Real'-time footage from US bombers in the air and from
cameras on the ground allowed the 'audience' to 'see' the action.
Nevertheless, this vision of a 'virtual,' high precision war was not
real.]{.underline}** Baudrillard argues in his 1995 piece, The Gulf War
Did Not Take Place, that what **[the 'audience' or viewers saw through
the media in 1990 -1991 was not the reality of the Gulf War. What was
seen was]{.underline}**, in fact, **[a simulation of a real war on
television]{.underline}**. What was seen and heard did not happen ---
that war was not real and did not occur. Baudrillard (1992) argues that
**[the media provides a simulation because it is an imperfect
representation of what happens in the world and the representations of
the real world.]{.underline}**

**[[From this simulation of high-tech war, a new hyperreality was
created]{.mark} --- one that looks like the simulated reality without
the original.]{.underline}** This has altered the perception not only of
what happened during the Gulf War but following conflicts. **[At the
heart of this hyperreality is a fixation with technology. [This fixation
plays out as a 'technology theatre.]{.mark}']{.underline}**

Technology theatre builds off Schneier's (2003) original understanding
of the 'security theatre.' Simply, the security theatre is doing
'things' to make reality feel secure without actually addressing the
causes of insecurity or threats. Heightened airport security
infrastructures after 9/11 are an often- cited example of the security
theatre. The **[technology theatre]{.underline}** is similar because it
also **[attempts to build a sense of security through interventions that
appear to solve a problem]{.underline}**. McDonald (2020) defines
technology theatre as "**[[the use of technology interventions that make
people feel as if a government]{.underline}]{.mark}** --- and, more
often, a specific group of political leaders --- **[[is solving a
problem, without it doing anything]{.underline}]{.mark}** to actually
solve that problem." For McDonald, **[the [technology theatre is a
distraction, a political tactic used to make governments appear to be
making progress]{.mark} in solving an issue]{.underline}**. For example,
this issue could be attempting to address the outbreak of COVID-19
through contact tracing applications. This paper sees the technology
theatre a bit differently. Instead of a largely political tool, **[the
technology theatre within the context of military operations is where
the hyperreality of war takes stage, with high-tech weapons on show in a
way that further reinforces the simulated reality of conflict. Both the
technology and the security theatres build on the visible aspect of
doing 'things' to address problems --- even if these 'things' are
performative instead of constructive.]{.underline}**

**The Spectacle of the Hyperreal**

Unlike Baudrillard's controversial statements in The Gulf War (1995), in
The Spirit of Terrorism and Requiem for the Twin Towers (2002),
Baudrillard argues that 9/11 did happen. Yet, he argues that there were
intangible unrealities that collapsed into each other as 9/11 became an
exchange of symbolic violence presented through the media (ibid. 2002).
This was different from what was 'seen' during the Gulf War. The
terrorist attacks in 2001 on the World Trade Center destroyed the
physical structures and the symbolic object. This occurred as a
'spectacle,' a 'fascination' with the image and its symbolism. More
specifically, "\[t\]he image consumes the event, in the sense that it
absorbs it and offers it for consumption" (Baudrillard 2002: 21). This
is different from McLuhan's (1964) idea that 'the medium is the
message.' **[Hyperreality does not distinguish between the medium or the
message --- the two can no longer be determined as distinct --- they
collapse into each other]{.underline}** (Baudrillard 1994**[).
Technologies and their content are not reality. Hyperreality, simulated
imagery, and inscribed technologies and information are part of the
technology theatre and are created by spectacles to be seduced
by.]{.underline}**

For Baudrillard, the Gulf War was a drama of a war whereby Western power
and ideas of modernity, democracy, and order were fully displayed. This
theatre performance was a hyperreality because the war appeared orderly,
precise, 'consensual,' and certain. The viewers at home could
'experience' the visuals and an impression of war without the original
at their leisure. The Gulf War was an "\...unreal war in which the
over-dimensioned technical power, in turn, over-evaluates the real
forces of an enemy which it cannot see" (Baudrillard 1995: 80). **[The
current perceptions of war were shaped by this simulation and are now
hyperrealities. [The consumer viewers' experience of war is mundane and
tied with leisure and the expectation that high tech will win
wars]{.mark}. The consumer has many options to experience this
hyperreality, including imagery and aesthetics imbued with
meaning.]{.underline}**

**[The [technologies within this theatre were inscribed with information
and meaning that feeds into and reinforces the performance]{.mark}
itself.]{.underline}** These inscription devices (recall Latour 1987)
are then reinforced by hyperrealities seen in visuals on television and
in 'real' time and played a role in the confusion of the real and the
hyperreal, including a fetishization of technologies.

**FETISHIZING TECHNOLOGIES: THE PLEASURES OF THE REAL MYTHS**

In this context of this discussion, a fetish is a consumer object. It is
something to be seduced by through consumption (Baudrillard 1998
\[1970\]). As previously discussed, consumerism is intertwined with the
postmodern condition and hyperreality. **[Technologies can be fetishized
and turned into objects of desire and fantasy-building.]{.underline}**
As argued by Baudrillard (1995), **[this was seen during the Gulf War,
where an emphasis on technologies as winning hyperreal wars is pivotal
to how we perceive the future of conflict. [The technology theatre
places technologies at the center of the stage to perform military
solutions to problems.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Circling back to the focus of this paper, what is to be done about
simulations, hyperrealities, theatres, and fetishisms? Why does the
security community fixate on Cold War discourse, fetishize technologies,
and become seduced by the hyperreality of a cyber Cold War? Ang's (1989)
work on melodramatic imaginations brings us towards some possible
answers. Drawing on Ang (1989; 1996), 'real' 'pleasures' can be
fulfilled by fantasies or myths. These are realities in themselves,
albeit hyperrealities, and this is a place to look for some insight into
the fixation with the new Cold War discourse.

Pleasures are not satisfactions; they are instead longing for a past
that can include a perceived future. This future can also be a perceived
past --- or a hyperreality --- it can be a present, but in all cases, it
is connected to the fiction of positions, solutions, feelings, and
structures (Ang 1989). In other words, **[there is pleasure in fictional
representations of reality or the melodramatic imagination. Identity and
meaning within these imaginations are fluid and are given meaning when
performed.]{.underline}** Recalling Butler's (1990) arguments about the
performativity and fluidity of gender, these identity performances occur
within specific contexts. To situate this argument in this paper:
**[technology theatres are where and how identities are performed, and
this gives and reinforces its meaning. [These performances and
melodramatic imaginations are nested in nostalgia for the Cold War
era]{.mark}]{.underline}**, or more specifically, **[[the order,
meaning, and identity]{.mark} ascribed within the binary [of bipolarity.
This is]{.mark} the pleasure of the techno-fetish.]{.underline}**

**[The nostalgia for the Cold War aesthetics as a melodramatic
imagination of the security community is [a search for meaning and order
in a cyber hyperreality where everything seems uncertain and
disordered.]{.mark} This includes the technologies, capabilities,
adversaries, strategies, operations, and the changing nature of war
itself. Nostalgia, myths, and simulations go hand-in-
hand]{.underline}** in this case:

"When the real is no longer what it used to be, nostalgia assumes its
full meaning. There is a proliferation of myths of origin and signs of
reality; of second-hand truth, objectivity and authenticity. There is an
escalation of the true, of the lived experience; a resurrection of the
figurative where the object and substance have disappeared. And there is
a panic-stricken production of the real and the referential, above and
parallel to the panic of material production. This is how simulation
appears in the phase that concerns us: a strategy of the real, neo-real
and hyperreal, whose universal double is a strategy of deterrence."
(Baudrillard 1983: 12).

Drawing on Mosco's (2005) description of the Digital Sublime, to
contextualize myths about technologies, myths "offer entrance to another
reality, a reality\... characterized by the promise of the sublime" (3).
The sublime and sublime icons are sources of "utopian visions" (ibid: 6)
"mutually constituted \...out of the interconnected realities\...."
(ibid: 10). Myths are not just distortions of reality --- they are a
form of reality and give meaning to the incomprehensible, allow us to
cope with overwhelming problems, and create comfortable and consensual
visions.

Myths are central to understanding cyber hyperrealities and new Cold War
discourse. Examining myths about technologies reveals the desires and
the hidden configurations of power nested in neoliberal practises. Myths
are enacted and continually contribute to constructing mythic 'things,'
theatres, and performances. In the next section, we apply theory to
practice.

**COLD WAR MYTHS TODAY**

**[The Cold War is over, yet the discourse on "Great Power" politics may
say otherwise. This is especially prevalent in popular discussions about
cyber and cyber-related emerging technologies and the future of
conflict. The uncertainty of modernity and the postmodern condition is
felt within the security community. The myths surrounding emerging
technologies guide the community to believe that we are indeed
experiencing a new Cold War. This is a melodramatic imagination to find
pleasure and comfort in the knowable and a past real (or a perception of
a past), where technologies were seen as tangible, and the wars'
happened.' These pasts and futures are ideas and aesthetics for
sale.]{.underline}** Myths are seductive, and "\[i\]n the real world,
the development and deployment of technologies have generated their own
mythic structures, borrowing from much older ideas and bringing these
together with new ideas have produced myths repacked for our time"
(Burnett et al. 2009: 1-2). Myths support and sustain consumerism,
creating identity, structures, institutions, and a complex interplay of
understandings. This is important to understand because it shapes
everyday lives, lived experiences, uses of technologies, and shapes
world views and power relations.

In defence policy, these myths and pleasurable hyperrealities are
reinforced. In SSE, for example, new Cold War nostalgia is visible and
mixed with the hyperreality of cyber:

"The re-emergence of major power competition has reminded Canada and its
allies of the importance of deterrence. At its core, deterrence is about
discouraging a potential adversary from doing something harmful before
they do it\... Deterrence has traditionally focused on conventional and
nuclear capabilities, but the concept is also increasingly relevant to
the space and cyber domains." (emphasis added, DND 2017: 50).

**[[Discussions about major power competition, deterrence, and
geopolitical technology races are new Cold War
discourse]{.mark}.]{.underline}** SSE describes the changing nature of
warfare due to the proliferation of weapons, hybrid tactics, terrorism,
among other factors. In the subsection, "The Re-Emergence of
Deterrence," the changing global security environment is described as a
"return of major power rivalry, new threats from non-state actors, and
challenges in the space and cyber domains have returned deterrence to
the centre of defence thinking" (emphasis added, DND 2017: 55).

Linking these concepts back to Baudrillard's arguments in The Gulf War
(1995), **[[war is a technology theatre whereby the heavy use and the
public display of high-tech weaponry in a conflict fetishize
technologies]{.mark}.]{.underline}** For Baudrillard (1995), the Gulf
War legitimized the logic of deterrence. **[One of the problems with
deterrence is that it assumes that everyone is on the same strategy page
with equal access to technology and weaponry. It assumes that there is a
result of escalation and is seeded in assumptions about deterrence
itself.]{.underline}** For Baudrillard (1995), the Cold War was based on
**[[the realist logic of deterrence]{.mark}.]{.underline}** This **[[has
become a hyperrealist logic of deterrence whereby the real is deterred
by the virtual]{.mark}. [This]{.mark} logic has [fundamentally changed
war]{.mark} --- it has made war abstract, beyond the imaginary, so that
[it becomes an unreality]{.mark} that is the reality.]{.underline}**

**[[Uncertainty about the future is perceived as uncertainty about
tech]{.mark}nological capabilities and their alignment with current
understanding and conflict strategies]{.underline}**. SSE states:

"Technological developments point to a future of defence that is
expected to be vastly different than today, with a greater emphasis on
information technologies, data analytics, deep learning, autonomous
systems, advancements in the electromagnetic and cyber domains, as well
as a range of transformative technologies, from quantum computing to
synthetic biology. Any number of these advances has the potential to
change the fundamental nature of military operations." (55).

According to Baudrillard, **[the technology theatre and the conflict
that followed the Gulf War are not about politics.]{.underline}**
Specifically, they are not the virtual version of the Clausewitzian
concept of the 'absence of war by other means.[' **[Cyber
conflicts]{.underline}**]{.mark}, or as Baudrillard refers to them as
'electronic wars'**[, do not have political objectives]{.underline}**
because:

"**[It [function]{.mark}s [as a preventative electroshock against any
future conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Just as in modern communication,
there is no longer any interlocutor, **[so [in this electronic war there
is no longer any enemy, there is only a refractory element which must be
neutralized and consensual]{.mark}]{.underline}**." (1995: 84).

In crafting policies to understand and strategize the future of
conflict, it is crucial to recognize the role that information plays in
inscription devices and the centres of calculation (Latour 1987). The
manipulation and use of information about technologies ascribes
legitimacy.

**CONCLUDING REMARKS: TRANSLATION, PLEASE**

To summarize the theoretical portion of this paper: the Cold War was a
perfectly conformable simulated reality to build into a simulacrum.
There was order in the Cold War: there was duality, dichotomies,
bipolarity. Yet, this was not the lived reality of the Cold War, but a
melodramatic imagination, where the imagery and perception of advanced
technologies are fetishized as the answer to solving conflicts.

This paper has engaged in a complicated discussion about how
technologies are framed within certain realities, used to craft
hyperrealities, and perpetuate mutually constructed myths about conflict
in the world. If the reader is skimming to the end of this paper to
arrive at the 'so-what' value, or to find some translation for this
postmodern-heavy content, then it is presented in this section. The
answer to the question: **[[what does this mean for
decision-makers?]{.underline}]{.mark}** is presented here as simply,
**[[proceed with caution]{.underline}]{.mark}** and do it in three ways:

1\) **[[Be critical of narratives laden with Cold War commentaries,
including Great Power rivalries, competition, and misguided dichotomies,
e]{.mark}specially when integrated into the cyber
environment.]{.underline}** Multiple actors exist and operate in the
world, each with different strategies, linkages, and goals. Competition
between actors may assume equal access to technology or similar
strategies, but it is not always the case.

2\) **[[Be wary of]{.mark} technological hype and [fixations on
technologies]{.mark} without understanding their capabilities in
multiple contexts and their ability to go between
applications.]{.underline}** Technologies can be sold for more than what
they are, and they may also assume compatible uses across multiple
contexts.

3\) **[[Uncertainty is ok.]{.mark} Facing disorder is challenging,
especially from a military standpoint, but [address]{.mark}ing
[uncertainty with flexible frameworks that do not]{.mark} seek to
[replicate an imaginary]{.mark} best practice that involves an adapted
model of [Cold War bipolarity.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

### China

#### China will never officially go to war. Rather, it will expand its influence through a violent and homogenizing assimilation of difference. Only an analysis of war as simulacra can hope to adequately address Chinese foreign policy.

(ii). Contemporary PRC rhetoric on pre-modern Chinese thought on war
[[In contemporary China, the official rhetoric on war focuses on
pre-emption and the claim that China will never be a 'hegemonic' or
warmongering power -- unlike the US.]{.mark} In this rhetoric, the
[Chinese war is by nature a non-war. Official documents]{.mark} emerging
in the last decade [repeatedly stress that China is]{.mark} by nature
[peaceful,]{.mark} which is why nobody needs to worry about its
rise.]{.underline} In the 2005 government whitepaper China's Peaceful
Development Road, for example, we are told that: \[i\]t is an inevitable
choice based on China's historical and cultural tradition that China
persists unswervingly in taking the road of peaceful development. The
Chinese nation has always been a peace-loving one. Chinese culture is a
pacific culture. The spirit of the Chinese people has always featured
their longing for peace and pursuit of harmony (State Council of the PRC
2005b). The whitepaper (and [numerous]{.underline} other [[official and
unofficial publications) posit an essentialised Chinese culture of
peacefulness as prior to any Chinese relations with the world. This
rhetoric]{.mark} of an inherently non-bellicose Chinese way has [also
echoed in Chinese academic debates]{.mark},]{.underline} where Chinese
pre-modern philosophy has come back in fashion as a (selectively
sampled) source of inspiration. The claims and logics that have come out
of these debates are varied. One significant grouping of Chinese
academics directly follow the government line and claim that 'choosing
"peaceful rise" is on the one hand China's voluntary action, on the
other hand it is an inevitable choice' (Liu Jianfei 2006: 38). That
peacefulness and harmony is something that 'Chinese people' have always
valued is an implication, and often explicitly stated 'fact' in these
literatures. Zhan Yunling, for example, claims that 'from ancient times
until today, China has possessed traditional thought and a culture of
seeking harmony' (Zhang Yunling 2008: 4). This claim to natural harmony
is mutually supportive of the claim that 'the Chinese nation' has always
been a peaceful nation, to authors such as Liu Jianfei (2006), or Yu
Xiaofeng and Wang Jiangli (2006). [A related set of commentators further
stress the significance of militarily non-violent means to China getting
its (naturally peaceful) way in international relations.]{.underline}
For example, Ding Sheng draws on the Sunzi quote mentioned above: 'to
subjugate the enemy's army without doing battle is the highest of
excellence' (Ding Sheng 2008: 197). [This line of argument
typically]{.underline} sees what [some would call 'soft power
tools']{.underline} as a way of getting others to become more like
yourself without any need for outright 'war' or other forms of physical
violence. In a discussion of the official government rhetoric of
'harmonious world' under former president Hu Jintao, Shi Zhongwen
accordingly stresses that the doctrine opposes going to extremes, and
therefore contradicts what Shi calls 'the philosophy of struggle' (Shi
Zhongwen 2008: 40, where 'struggle' implies Marxist ideology). Qin
Zhiyong similarly argues that China needs to steer away from collisions
and embrace the aim of 'merging different cultures' (Qin Zhiyong 2008:
73). [At the same time, few Chinese academics question the direction of
the 'merging of cultures']{.underline} discussed above -- [clearly it is
other cultures that should merge into China's peaceful one. In a common
line of thought that draws on the historical concept of Tianxia, or
'All-under-heaven', it is argued that [the Chinese leadership can thus
bring about a harmonious world through 'voluntary submission \[by
others\] rather than force' simply through its superior morality and
exemplary behaviour]{.mark}]{.underline} (Yan Xuetong 2008: 159). [On
this logic, the [leadership will never need to use violence, because
everybody will see its magnanimity and will want to emulate its
behaviour]{.mark}]{.underline} (Zhao Tingyang 2006: 34. See Callahan
2008: 755 for a discussion). [Much of these debates have come to pivot
around]{.underline} this concept of [Tianxia, an imaginary of the world
that builds on a holistic notion of space, without radical self-other
distinction or bordered difference.]{.underline} To some thinkers, this
imagination is based on a notion of globalisation (for example Yu
Xiaofeng and Wang Jiangli 2006: 59) or networked space (Ni Shixiong and
Qian Xuming 2008: 124) where everything is always already connected to
everything else in a borderless world. In these accounts, Tianxia
thinking is 'completely different from Western civilisation, since
Chinese civilisation insists on its own subjectivity, and possesses
inclusivity' (Zhou Jianming and Jiao Shixin 2008: 28). Despite this
apparent binary, it is claimed that Tianxiaism involves an
identification with all of humankind, where there is no differentiation
or distinction between people (Li Baojun and Li Zhiyong 2008: 82). A
thinker whose deployment of the Tianxia concept has been particularly
influential is Zhao Tingyang, who proposes the concept as a Chinese and
better way of imagining world order (Zhao Tingyang 2005; 2006), where
'better' means better than the 'Western' inter-state system to which
Tianxia is portrayed as the good opposite. In opposition to this
'Western system', he argues that Tianxia can offer 'a view from nowhere'
or a view 'from the world', where '\[w\]orld-ness cannot be reduced to
internationality, for it is of the wholeness or totality rather than the
between-ness' (Zhao Tingyang 2006: 39). However, [as a consequence of a
prioritisation of order over the preservation of alterity, 'any
inconsistency or contradiction in the system will be a
disaster']{.underline} (Zhao Tingyang 2006: 33). As a corollary of this
prioritisation, Zhao comes to insist on the homogeneity of his
all-inclusive space, which aims at the uniformity of society (Zhao
Tingyang 2006: 33, emphasis in original) where 'all political levels ...
should be essentially homogenous or homological so as to create a
harmonious system' (2006: 33). The aim of the Tianxia system is thus to
achieve one single homogeneous and uniform space. [[Clearly, for such
homogeneity to be born from a heterogeneous world, someone must
change.]{.underline}]{.mark} Zhao argues that: one of the principles of
Chinese political philosophy is said 'to turn the enemy into a friend',
and it would lose its meaning if it were not to remove conflicts and
pacify social problems -- in a word, to 'transform' (化) the bad into
the good (Zhao Tingyang 2006: 34). Moreover, this conversion to a single
'good' homogeneity should happen through 'volontariness' rather than
through expansive colonialism: 'an empire of All-under-Heaven could only
be an exemplar passively in situ, rather than positively become
missionary' (Zhao Tingyang 2006: 36, emphasis in original). [However,
when we are given clues as to how this idea of the 'good' to which
everyone should conform would be determined, [Zhao's idea of self-other
relations seems to rely on the possibility of some Archimedean point
from which to judge this good, and/or the complete eradication of any
otherness, so that the one space that exists is completely the space of
self]{.mark}]{.underline} (Zhao Tingyang 2006: 33). [Thus]{.underline},
Zhao confesses that [['\[t\]he unspoken theory is that most people do
not really know what is best for them, but that the elite do]{.mark}, so
the elite ought genuinely to decide for the people']{.underline} (2006:
32). As explained by William A. Callahan: By thinking through the world
with a view from everywhere, Zhao argues that we can have a 'complete
and perfect' understanding of problems and solutions that is
'all-inclusive'. With this all-inclusive notion of Tianxia, there is
literally 'no outside'.... Since all places and all problems are
domestic, Zhao says that 'this model guarantees the a priori
completeness of the world' (Callahan 2007: 7). [This 'complete and
perfect' understanding is hence attainable only to an elite, who will
achieve homogeneity (convert others into self) through example.
[Eventually, then, there will be no other, the 'many' will have been
transformed into 'the one']{.mark} (Zhao Tingyang 2005: 13, see also
2006[). It is through this transformation and submission to the ruling
elite that the prevention of war is imagined.]{.mark}]{.underline} If
Baudrillard had engaged with these contemporary Chinese redeployments of
pre-modern thought on war (which, to my knowledge, he never did), I
think he would have recognised many of the themes that interested him in
Western approaches to the first Gulf war. [Most strikingly, this is a
way of talking about war that writes out war from its story. Like
deterrence, [it is an imagination of war that approaches it via
prevention and pre-emption]{.mark}. What is more, we recognise an
obsession with the self-image of the self to itself -- in this case, a
Chinese, undemocratic self rather than a Western, democratic one. [In
this Chinese war]{.mark},]{.underline} like in the Persian Gulf of which
Baudrillard wrote, [[there is no space for an Other that is
Other.]{.mark} In the Tianxia imaginary, [Others can only be imagined as
something that will eventually assimilate into The System and become
part of the Self, as the Self strives for all-inclusive perfection.
There is no meeting with an Other in any form. Encounter only happens
once the Other becomes like the Self, is assimilated into the One, and
hence there is no encounter at al]{.mark}l]{.underline} (for an analysis
that reads Baudrillard and Tianxia to this effect in a Chinese non-war
context, see Nordin 2012). (iii). Contemporary Chinese war and its
various modes As was the case with the first Gulf War, [the war that we
are waiting for here in the Chinese case is thus a non-war. If by war we
mean some form of (symbolic) exchange or some clash of forms, agons, or
forces]{.underline} (as we tend to do even in the current 'cutting edge
research' in 'critical war studies', see Nordin and Öberg 2013) -- [we
cannot expect it to take place. [In China, we see not only a
participation in the Western system of (non)war through the war on
terror, but also another system that precisely denies space for
imagining an other as Other, which in turn makes the idea of exchange
impossible.]{.mark} In this sense, the Ancient Chinese approach to war
through]{.underline} the [Tianxia]{.underline} concept -- at least [as
it is reflected by current Chinese thinkers]{.underline} like Zhao
Tingyang and Yan Xuetong -- [is not a]{.underline} Clausewitzean [war
continuing politics by other means, but precisely a continuation of the
absence of politics by other means.]{.underline} It arguably shares this
aspect with both the first and the second Gulf Wars. [This, however, is
certainly not to say that there are not those who fear a Chinese war or
that we have no reason to fear it. In various guises, the war that is
imagined through a Clausewitzean ontology of agonistic and reciprocal
exchange returns and is reified also in China. It is not uncommon for
authors discussing the Chinese traditions of thinking war that I
describe above to begin their discussion by explicitly drawing on
Clausewitz and take his war as their point of departure]{.underline}
(for example Liu Tiewa 2014). For several Chinese writers, [[it is clear
that this building of a 'harmonious world' is directed against others
whose influence should be 'smashed']{.underline}]{.mark} (Fang Xiaojiao
2008: 68). From this line of thinkers, [the call to build a harmonious
world has also been used to argue for increased Chinese military
capacity,]{.underline} including its naval power (Deng Li 2009).
[Although Chinese policy documents stress that violence or threat of
violence should be avoided, they similarly appear to leave room for
means that would traditionally be understood as]{.underline} both
['hard']{.underline} and 'soft' in Joseph [Nye's
dichotomisation]{.underline} (See for example State Council of the PRC
2005a). [Indeed, many of Chinas neighbours have voiced concern with
growing Chinese military capacity over the last few years, and a
[Chinese non-war is no less frightening to its neighbours than a
war]{.mark} -- be it labelled 'just' or 'unjust', 'real' or 'virtual'.
This Chinese war -- past, present and future -- is acted out in various
different modes. Violent war is reified through the spectacle of
computer games, art, online memes, cartoons and not least dramas on film
and television]{.underline} (Diamant 2011, 433). [[The Chinese state
claims success in all of its wars, and simultaneously claims that it has
never behaved aggressively beyond its borders]{.mark} (which is also, of
course, a convenient way of glossing over all the violence perpetrated
by the Chinese state within those borders, the violence with which they
are upheld and with which they were established in the first place, and
the clear contradiction between the state's fixation on territorial
integrity and its borderless and holistic Tianxia rhetoric). Popular
cultural renditions of war]{.underline} paint a more varied picture, but
[all contribute to a reification of war. Recent Chinese productions that
reify war on the screen through what we may call 'war porn' are numerous
-- indeed]{.underline}, it has been claimed that [China
produces]{.underline} what is probably [the highest number of dramas set
in wartime in the world]{.underline} (Diamant 2011: 433). One example
accessible to a non-Chinese audience is Feng Xiaogang's Assembly
(Jijiehao 集结号) from 2007, [which recreate]{.underline}s [horrifically
violent and 'realistic' battle scenes from the Civil War]{.underline}
[between]{.underline} Guomindang [nationalists and Communist troops. The
Second Sino-Japanese war is another popular setting]{.underline} for
these reifications of war, providing the backdrop for another large
budget film by Feng Xiaogang, the 2012 Back to 1942 (Yijiusier
一九四二), and international star-director Zhang Yimou's The Flowers of
War (Jinling shisan chai 金陵十三钗). Another example is Lu Chuan's City
of [Life and Death]{.underline} (Nanjing! Nanjing! 南京！南京！) which
became a box office hit in China in 2009, but [was criticized for its
portrayal of a Japanese soldier as a fully formed and sympathetic
person]{.underline} in its narration of the Nanjing massacre. [Off
screen China has]{.underline}, in the reform era since Mao's death,
[seen a new and related wave of commemorations of the Civil and
Anti-Japanese wars in]{.underline} [museums throughout China, which play
a central role in national education campaigns to 'never forget national
humiliation'.]{.underline} Examples that house both permanent
exhibitions and temporary special exhibits commemorating particular war
events include the Rape of Nanjing Memorial/Nanjing Massacre museum in
Nanjing; the Military Museum, the Museum of Revolutionary History and
the Memorial Museum of the Chinese People's War of Resistance to Japan
in and outside Beijing; and the September 18th Incident Memorial and
Museum of the Manchurian Crisis in Shenyang, to name but a few (these
museums and their exhibits of war have been studied for example by
Mitter 2000, 2003 and Waldron 1996). Many of [these museums include
vivid reconstructions, often as waxworks with sound and motion, of
horrific battlefield scenes for its audience to consume.
Reifications]{.underline} of war on screen and in museums [moreover tie
in with a 'new remembering' by academic and popular publications since
the late 1980s, which commemorates and fetishizes China's past
experiences of war as well as projects that experience into the present
and the future through the ever-present rhetoric of 'National
Humiliation']{.underline} (guochi.For articles tracing this 'new
remembering', see Coble 2007 and Mitter 2003). [Masses of propaganda are
devoted to the commemoration of the Anti-Japanese war,]{.underline}
particularly relating to various Campaigns to Support the People's
Liberation Army and Military Dependents, and in annually recurring
celebrations of the Spring Festival, the Anniversary of the founding of
the People's Republic, Army Day and the 'National Humiliation Day' which
has received much academic attention in recent years (Callahan 2004,
2009; Wang Zheng 2008). Much of [the state-led reification]{.underline}
of war, [and]{.underline} particularly [its treatment in academic
publications and governmental speeches, has centred on the 'numbers
game' of claiming high death tolls and economic costs of the battle
histories of the Anti-Japanese war, rather than fore-fronting the
all-too-human element that may be found in for example memoir
literature]{.underline} (Coble 2007, 406). Accordingly, other scholars
have argued -- and I agree with them here -- that ['\[a\]lthough Chinese
movies and television often feature military-related themes, it is rare
to find frank and politicized depictions of China's military
conflicts']{.underline} (Diamant 2011: 431). [As in the Tianxia
narrative discussed above, [politics is paradoxically eradicated from
these versions of war, together with an other understood as a human
other]{.mark}.]{.underline} However, the literatures critiquing this
de-politicization typically criticise the intellectual elites in various
cultural and propaganda offices for producing an 'artificial rendering
of China's wars' denying veterans an 'authentic military voice' (Diamant
2011: 431, 461). My point here is different. [It is not a question of
creating an image of false representation]{.underline}, or what we may
call [a third order simulation, a masking of the reality of war. Rather,
the point is that [reality and illusion can no longer be distinguished,
but have collapsed into one another. There is no longer a 'real' war
behind these narratives which can be uncovered]{.mark}]{.underline} (cf.
Nordin 2012). [Through these other modes, [the Chinese non-war is
reified as war]{.mark}.]{.underline} Like the Gulf War of which
Baudrillard wrote, [it appears seamless, yet is riddled with
contradictions.]{.underline} If what took place in the Persian Gulf was
the spectacle of war, [[what is taking place in contemporary China
is]{.underline}]{.mark} perhaps better understood as [[the spectacle of
non-war]{.mark}.]{.underline} Like the spectacle of war [it has a range
of strategic and political purposes]{.underline} for everyone involved.
[Like the pre-emptive narratives of Tianxia, the reifications of war
that hark back to a Clausewitzean ontology relay a war that is scripted
or coded in advance, disallowing alterity. And to those who fear the
possibility of the Chinese war, we]{.underline} might [indeed see
reasons to fear, but also provide a reminder that [it is stupid to be
for or against this war, if we do no for a moment question its
probability, credibility or level of reality.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Their harmonious conception of Chinese rise to the global stage is nothing but the integration of China into the Westphalian order of integral reality -- you should be skeptical of academic claims of this nature.

We have seen how [China's rise is commonly described in terms of
inevitable destiny because of history.]{.underline} Meanwhile, [the PRC
leadership is strictly managing the imagined form and significance of
such a rise]{.underline}. Since 2008 [China has placed new focus on
using mega events to shape the expectations of domestic and
international audiences, and thus to shape the future.]{.underline} Such
mega events included [the 2008 Olympic games, the 2009 60th anniversary
of the founding of the PRC, as well as Expo 2010 Shanghai China. Expo
2010 was seen as an expression of and tool for the building of
harmonious world by Chinese academics]{.underline} (for example Zou
Keyuan, 2011: 11). Yan Xuetong's Ancient4 Chinese4Thought4was adorned
with an image of the Chinese national pavilion at the Expo on its book
cover. [The Expo was also associated with harmony by the party- state.
Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao stuck closely to the official articulation of
"harmonious world" when he described the Shanghai Expo as: an
encyclopedia lying open on the land and a magnificent painting
showcasing the integration and harmony of diverse cultures ... The World
Expo is a vivid demonstration of the diversity of human civilizations.
The Shanghai Expo has offered a broad stage for inter-cultural exchanges
and integration, reminding us that we live in a divers and colorful
world]{.underline} (Wen Jiabao, 2010a). He continued to argue that [the
Expo had fully demonstrated harmony to be the common aspiration of
mankind, and that the Expo was above national, ethnic and religious
boundaries.]{.underline} This, to Premier Wen, was why "\[i\]t is
important that countries ... work together to build a harmonious world
of lasting peace and common prosperity" (Wen Jiabao, 2010a). [The Expo
was made possible by China's economic rise, but was also part of
establishing the story of such a rise as true, and of narrating a future
where China rises to be the benevolent leader of a new harmonious world
order.]{.underline} In this chapter I examine the way ideas of [China's
role as leader of a harmonious world proliferated at Expo
2010.]{.underline} I go about this examination in two parts. In the
first part I trace the two cosmologies that I outlined in the academic
literatures in the previous chapter, "unit- based" and "holistic"
spatial imaginaries. I continue to argue, now in the context of Expo
2010, that the two cosmologies are not mutually exclusive. I show how
they are deployed at the Expo in ways that reinforce one another by
ordering spatial difference through teleological time. The two
cosmologies are worked out in conjunction with one another at Expo 2010,
in ways that support a particular discourse on China and the world,
prescriptive of a particular future where China leads a new harmonious
world order. Like some of the academic literatures examined in the
previous chapter, [the Expo worldview portrays itself as "from the
world" or "from everywhere", yet insists on "specifically Chinese" terms
and experience, and on the singular China's Future as the (harmonious)
world's Future. On this view, there is only one Future, and it does not
welcome contestation.]{.underline} Having recognised this effect of
harmony at the Expo, I argue in the second part that [we need to move
beyond the reading of mega events as simple representation and ideology
and read it also as simulation and simulacra. Reading the Chinese world
fair as a simulacrum of world order can provide different ways of
relating "the West" to its "other country" China.]{.underline} I examine
this relation through asking what it means to be the fair: [Where is the
world fair- When is the world fair- Who is the world fair- Reading the
world/fair as simulacrum disrupts the fair's notions of inside and
outside, now and then, subject and object to the point where these terms
are no longer workable.]{.underline} What we end up with is not the many
turning into the one, with the convergence of others into the self.
Instead, what remains is a fragmented plethora of truth, not the unreal
but the hyper-real. My reading of Expo 2010 as simulacra examines some
of the distinctions implied in the where,4when4and4who4of the
world/fair, and shows that we may be better off not taking our
distinctions so seriously. THE TWO COSMOLOGIES AND HARMONY AT EXPO 2010
Expo 2010 took place in the tradition of scientific and industrial world
fairs following on from the
Great4Exhibition4of4Industries4of4All4Nations that was held in London in
1851. [Expo 2010 has been read in China to symbolise the greatness and
international significance of China -- indeed, it was the largest, most
expensive, and most visited of its kind]{.underline} (Barboza, 2010;
Xinhua, 2010d; 2010e). The 73 million visitors who passed through the
Expo in Shanghai during the six months it was officially open as world
fair would be even greater if one counted the subsequent visitors
attracted to the site's permanent monuments (the Chinese national
pavilion for example has been turned into a permanent museum) and to the
online version of Expo 2010, where one's avatar can stroll through a
virtual 3D replica of the site, visit pavilions and partake in numerous
exhibitions as well as interact with other visitors. [Unit-based spatial
imaginaries are immediately obvious at the Expo. Space at the Expo is
typically imagined in a modernist manner as a flat surface upon which
humans act, as a "stage" or "platform". As for the unit-based
territorialisation of this surface, the Expo site is organised as an
imagined state system, divided into bounded continents of national
pavilions.]{.underline} At the online Expo, we can take guided tours of
pavilions and exhibitions and get a virtual passport in which we can
collect visa stamps from the various territories visited. Likewise, at
the [Expo visitors, who may never have been abroad and may not own a
passport in the outside world, can get a multitude of visa stamps and
"play" at being well-travelled.]{.underline} It is an enactment of the
world that pretends such international life is readily available and
unrestricted. [It draws up borders and barriers in order to let them be
crossed, but by no means erased or blurred.]{.underline} Through turning
visa collection into a game, border controls appear innocent at the same
time as their indisputable "natural existence" between states is
reinforced. However, it becomes clear that partaking in this game of
"open borders" is conditional. At the Expo, I met a young travel guide,
who visited the Expo with 60 tourists from Beijing. While her group went
into the Pavilion of Future (subtitled "Dream inspires the future") and
had their pretend passports stamped, she waited ticketless outside,
stopped at the border because she did not have the right papers.
Simultaneously, the "external" nation-state system echoed in citizenship
regimes inside the Expo when producing a "real" passport meant one could
jump pavilion queues for the pavilion of the country that had issued it.
[This way of conceiving of space in terms of bordered units was marked
throughout the Expo. China's own pavilion of regions was no exception,
subdivided into regional containers of culture -- many even look like
boxes with essentialised culture exhibited inside, like the virtual
version of the Tibetan pavilion]{.underline} below. [Although obviously
steeped in a unit-based spatial imaginary, these bounded units are also
enveloped in the holistic celestial order of one-worldness. The key
terms in holistic imaginaries are the "all-encompassing" or
"all-inclusive", that with "no outside" or "no exception", "network",
and of course "Tianxia". The holistic imagination of everything as
always already connected to everything else appears in the room in
Urbanian4Pavilion themed "Connection"(]{.underline}交往). [This room is
based on the "scientific theory called six degrees spatial theory",
which states that no two people are separated by more than 6
relationships (Xu Wei, 2010: 27). On the ceiling a film is projected
showing selected people's movements on a map. Portraits of people appear
in circles connected by lines to more and more other people/circles
until they form a web or network on the round screen, bringing your mind
to the Earth and thus the idea that all people of the world are
connected (Xu Wei, 2010: 27). There is no one outside the network.
Moreover, this claim is backed up by science, and thus requires no
further explanation.]{.underline} The Pavilion of City Being describes
the city as a living being or organism, focusing on the theme of
shengming (生命), meaning life, being or bios. The holistic imagination
implied in this idea of the city as one body or life is clear from
slogans such as "city being multiplies endlessly, held together by
superseding cycles" and "the unceasing adjustment between people and
city maintains city life harmonious, healthy city life requires our
common protection" (Xu Wei, 2010: 40). The Pavilion4of4Urban4Planet
moreover draws on a holistic spatial imaginary to tell us on the "Road
of Solutions" how the resolution to the world's problems can be found:
"\[t\]he seasons change, settlement becomes cities and trading routes
develop into a completely4networked4world ... Only with open mind and
allWinclusive4view can we bring the hope of sustainable growth to our
planet Earth" (emphasis added). These references to the organically
connected single organism or body, the web of connections with no
outside and the completely networked world with an all inclusive view
all provide the basis of a holistic spatial imaginary. Moreover, the
comments above indicate that this holistic imaginary is taken to demand
the harmonious balance of all and "our common protection".
Classification in time and space [From the above we see that
imaginations of China in the world at the Expo draw on both unit-based
and holistic notions of space.]{.underline} This instance shows the two
spatial imaginaries coexisting in contemporary China, and so refutes the
idea that one would be superseding the other. I next look closer at how
they work in tandem at the Expo. Throughout the Expo, classification of
space is marked. We have seen it above in the unit-based form of mapping
state units, as well as that of regions as containers of culture. The
[holistic Tianxia concept does not refer to the jigsaw-puzzled space of
the unit-based imaginary, but nonetheless classifies and sequentialises
through a centre/periphery, civilised/barbarian divide. Tianxia ordering
is similar to the Expo site centred on the Chinese
pavilion.]{.underline} Similarly, the comparison and contrasting of
"East" and "West" is ever present. In a film screened at the Pavilion of
City Being we are watched from the screen by "the eyes of Eastern
people, the eyes of Western people" (Xu Wei, 2010: 49). Likewise, "Pre-
show Hall" in the Pavilion4of4Footprint shows "ideal cities" as they
have been imagined in the East and in the West. Dreaming of a better
future is described as universal, or eternal (永恒), but similarities
end there and juxtaposition takes over. [The division of space into
civilisational/regional/national units is aligned with division of time
into eras, often in its ancient/modern guise. This is where, just as in
much academic discourse, we see evidence of the alignment of
dichotomized here/there, modern/ancient and subject/object]{.underline}
(cf. Fabian, 1983). As a number of "developing" countries could not fund
their own participation in Expo 2010, Chinese subsidies to these
countries ensured there were more state and organisation pavilions, 246,
than at any previous Expo (Xinhua, 2010e). [The vastly different budgets
and scales meant pavilions gave the impression of a developmental or
aspirational classification, in a visual display of global inequality.
As in global development, China financially supported "less-developed"
states in a way that visually emphasised the impressive scale and
central location of the Chinese pavilion and reaffirmed China as a
"helper" and "developer" ahead of the "helped" and "developing" states
at the Expo site periphery, such as the African Joint and Pacific Joint
pavilions.]{.underline} This convening of others differentiated in space
through time is crystallised in Urbanian4Pavilion, which shows the
morning rituals of families taken to represent five continents. It shows
the similarities of getting up, washing, brushing teeth and so on of
people from these different spatial/cultural units. However, the
sequentialisation in time is obvious. The man from Rotterdam has an
electric toothbrush and the Chinese middleclass office worker wears new
pyjamas in his modern bathroom, whereas the bathroom in Rio de Janeiro
looks worn and dirty. In this way spatial difference is aligned in
temporal sequence. We all do the same thing; it is just that some are a
bit behind on the road to Modernisation and Development. [Spatial
division is thus not only conceived as classification of space, but also
as classification in time. This classification is moreover conceived of
in a time that runs towards a particular end. Clock time running out or
towards the future is emphasised at the Shanghai train station's Expo
clock tower, as well as throughout the Expo itself by feature clocks,
ticking pendula and hourglasses.]{.underline} The intertwining of
temporal notions with strong assertions as to what Chinese identity is
in world affairs is clear from an introduction to the Expo on its
official website, ringing with familiarity with the official party-line:
\[w\]ith a long civilisation, China favours international exchange and
loves world peace. China owes its successful bid for the World
Exposition in 2010 to the international community's support for and
confidence in its reform and opening-up. The Exposition will be the
first registered World Exposition in a developing country, which gives
expression to the expectations the world's people place on China's
future development ... We count on the continuing attention, support and
participation of all the peace-loving countries (Expo 2010 Shanghai
China, 2008). [In this context, depicting China as original confers on
it a status as fore-runner of developing countries, conveniently
forgetting the 1949 Haiti Expo (Expo 2010 Shanghai China, 2006a; Bureau
International des Expositions, 2011).4 China's present and future
direction is frequently depicted in terms of a return to an original or
always intended state. The Expo itself is typically portrayed as the
fulfilment (led by the PRC/CCP party-state) of an ancient Chinese
dream.]{.underline} This portrayal appears in articles (Expo 2010
Shanghai China, 2006b), in books such as 1004
years4of4Expo4dream4(百年世博梦)4(Shanghai shibohui shiwu xietiaoju,
2009), and in the World Expo Museum that looks back at more than 150
years of historical preparation for the Shanghai Expo. Online
commentators echo such narratives, and one commentator on the Expo
online "Dream Wall" comments that "[I believe in China's actual
strength, a country that has 5000 years of civilisation must be able to
produce glory once more]{.underline}" (Expo Shanghai Online, 2010c).
Finally, the feature film of the Xinjiang regional pavilion demonstrates
how [classification of time and space come together into a particular,
goal-oriented progress under PRC leadership]{.underline}: \[[Xinjiang
is\] the communication land of four great civilisations of the world
\... It once was the road of bonze Xuanzang, the silk road, the road of
western expedition and the road of eastern return ... The great
transformation of 60 years is the evidence of our diligence and
intelligence ... Today, the assistance from the motherland also lights
up the passion in Xinjiang (Expo Shanghai Online,
2010g)]{.underline}.104 This quote brings together the numerous elements
that make possible the problematic imagination of self-other relations
that is under discussion in this thesis. A separation between
civilisations is posited. Xinjiang is subsequently conceived of as a
place where these separate civilisations meet. Progress is imagined as a
return to a state that once was, and that is now returning through
Chinese diligence in its (re)civilising mission. One can only wonder at
the irony as the motherland's assistance "lights up the passion" in
Xinjiang after the brutal ethnic clashes in the years running up to the
Expo (Xinhua, 2009d). 104 Bonze Xuan Zang is a Buddhist sage from
Chinese literary classic Journey to the West. Metaphors of lines,
circles, spirals and pendula may be used to describe this temporality,
but may be misleading as they change significance in their combined use
(cf. Gell, 1992). Analogue clock time, for instance, may be circular if
used as for example a toy, but indicates linear time flow when allied
with other concepts, such as civilisational progress and development.
The point of China's progress/return (to its rightful place as world
leader) is not whether we describe it using the metaphor of the circle
or the line. Of [key importance is instead the way it operates through a
classification of time and space: and there is no doubt as to where we
are/should be heading. The point is that these temporalities support
each other and lead towards the same ultimate endpoint. The Future is
one where China leads a new harmonious world order Chinese discussions
surrounding the Expo typically conferred on it one central meaning -- it
was a sign of China's legitimate rise to world leadership.]{.underline}
Wishes for Chinese superiority similarly appeared in the online
Vanke-Pavilion, the corporate pavilion for a large Chinese property
developer. One commentator wished that in 2049 "[China is in leading
position in the world]{.underline}" (中国处于世界领先) and another
exclaimed that by then "China has really changed into a great cultural
country, ten thousand countries come to pay tribute " (万邦来朝)105
(Expo Shanghai Online, 2010f). A majority of participants in the Expo's
"Dream wall" expressed love for the motherland, the Expo and Shanghai,
with one exclaiming, ["Go Expo, China is invincible "]{.underline} (Go
Expo 中国无敌) (Expo Shanghai Online, 2010c). Key to justifying this
Chinese world leadership is depicting such a world as "harmonious", in
accordance with the harmonious world discourse. The Expo is steeped in
this language of harmony. China's national pavilion begins with the film
"Harmonious China" (hexie4Zhongguo4和谐中国) and concludes with telling
us "[the lotus flowers blossom, symbolising the harmonious and glorious
future of Chinese cities"]{.underline} (Expo Shanghai Online, 2010a).
The Xinjiang pavilion is labelled "Xinjiang -- a 105 This set
formulation is commonly used to indicate great power. - 146 - harmonious
land". We go to the Expo on a harmonious train, to visit Harmony Tower,
and if we hurt ourselves we can have a band-aid from the harmonious
first aid kit. Figure 5: Harmonious first aid kit (Source: Astrid
Nordin) The language of harmony is also prevalent among the wishes of
Vanke4Pavilion. One participant wishes: [2010: A life at ease A peaceful
and stable job Wishing the great motherland is increasingly thriving and
prosperous My family is increasingly harmonious and happy 2049: There is
no war in any corner of the world There is no discrimination Peaceful
getting along and also wish that when we reach that time people from
every corner of the world can all profoundly understand China (Expo
Shanghai Online, 2010f). We see here a mixing of ideas of harmony with
notions of a good personal life, a thriving China, and an image of
peacefully connected world citizens who comprehend China. Again, there
is an emphasis on making foreigners **understand** "China".]{.underline}
A blurb for Pavilion4of4Future's harmony sculpture similarly
personalizes world harmony: "core concept of traditional Chinese
culture: only the harmony of the world and all things constitute the
harmony of human's spirit". Just as in Zhao's Tianxia, we require the
harmony of all things[. There can be no outside to the system, or it
will fail. All things must be incorporated. This, the claim is, is a
distinctly Chinese idea of world order.]{.underline} Throughout all of
these imaginings of China in the (harmonious) world, the two spatial
imaginaries combine in ways that repeat the problems outlined with
regards to academic discourse, making difficult the imagination of
others as coeval. The [unit- based spatial imaginary provides a
condition of possibility of Chinese particularism. Throughout the
Chinese pavilions at the Expo, China is the very origin of civilisation
and of the world -- it is where the first fire burnt, the first bird
flew, and the superior values of Confucian harmony
originated.]{.underline} The holistic spatial imaginary becomes key to
imagining the need for spreading this civilisation, and for the Chinese
civilising mission we currently observe around the world (Nyíri, 2006).
[The holistic idea of space is core to construing the rise of China to
leadership of a harmonious world as peaceful and beneficial to all. In
actuality, there is no outside, everything is always already connected
to everything else, and the view of the Chinese party elite is a "view
from nowhere", or a view "from the world".]{.underline} Many of these
themes are echoed through non-Chinese pavilions at the Expo, including
the two spatial imaginaries, the goal-oriented notion of time, East-West
juxtaposition and a reliance on blurry notions of civilisation. Notably,
[many foreign states, organisations and enterprises used the Expo to
exhibit their willingness to buy into the Chinese discourse on
harmonious world, allowing it prominence of place in the way they name,
speak of and write of their own pavilions. "Harmony" in particular is
given legitimacy through frequent use in foreign pavilions, such as
"Harmonious relations" (Pacific joint pavilion), "Feel the harmony"
(Austria), "Harmony of the heart, harmony of the skills" (Japan), and so
on.]{.underline} While some academic analyses of Chinese foreign policy
argue that the PRC is being "socialised" into values and norms of
"international society" (Johnston, 2008), the Expo showed the opposite:
"outsiders" competing to be most attentive to and accommodating of
China's purported self- image. [Non-Chinese corporate pavilions too
helped reinforce and legitimate this particular version of "harmony"
with reference to Chinese history. One example was the
pavilion]{.underline} called "Tianxia yi4jia" (天下一家): "[Tianxia one
family]{.underline}". This pavilion was German multinational Siemens'
corporate pavilion, showcasing its technology through the aspirational
middle class future of interactive games and wine coolers that will
apparently be available to Chinese people in 2015. Entering Siemens'
harmonious and commercialised rendition of Tianxia we are photographed.
[As in a miracle of scientific development our faces appear on a film
screen at the exit, manipulated to sing together in harmony with the
Expo theme tune. The simulation is explained]{.underline} at a sign at
the pavillion entrance: [\[a\]fter scanning and capturing the user's
facial features, the image will be recorded and transformed into an
avatar allowing users to feel as if they are starring in a
pre-programmed movie or video ... How will this technology better our
lives- Provides an entertaining experience for people to play a role in
a movie or become a "star". Everyone has the chance to stand in the
spotlight. China's Future, in this commercialised version as in its
official one, provides the time and space for us all to be stars in the
spotlight. It]{.underline} is worth recalling here the organisers' own
reading where the Expo took place because of "the international
community's support for and confidence in \[China's\] reform and
opening-up", expressing "the expectations the world's people place on
China's future development" with China sternly counting on "the
continuing attention, support and participation of all the peace-loving
countries" (Expo 2010 Shanghai China, 2008). In this version of the
Future World we are allowed into the spotlight on the condition that we
become avatars that sing simultaneously in one voice to the Chinese
melody. Foreclosing futures at Expo 2010 In this part of the chapter I
have argued that the holistic and unit-based cosmologies, or spatial
imaginaries, were prominent at Expo 2010, aligning classified units of
time/space in sequence. They are simultaneously deployed in ways that
support a particular discourse on China and the World, prescriptive of a
particular future where China leads a new harmonious world order. World
fairs were from the outset an exercise where self/other relations were
heavily tinted by imperialism (Rydell, 1984). Today, although the
specific selves and others reproduced by the Expo may be somewhat
different their fundamental manoeuvre is the same. The articulation of
time/space with the narrative of harmony is problematic, again and
despite itself, because it marginalises concepts of coeval
multiplicities and difference. Others are not properly different, they
are just behind. [Just like Zhao's Tianxia, the Expo worldview portrays
itself as "from the world" or "from everywhere", yet insists on
"specifically Chinese" terms and experience. This is reinforced as the
Expo shows an already nationalistic domestic audience a China that
rightfully rises to the place of world leader and the folly of anyone
imagining that such a rise would be less than beneficial to all. This is
buttressed by readings of foreign involvement and investment in the Expo
as endorsements of the Chinese model for its rise, and is taken as a
showcase for how harmonious the world is under Chinese
leadership.]{.underline} The Expo worldview portrays itself as "from the
world", yet insists on the singular China's Future as the (Harmonious)
World's Future. On this view, there is only one Future, and it does not
welcome contestation. I propose that we can refuse scripting our songs
in the pre-programmed manner suggested by predominant imaginings at the
Expo. It can indeed be possible to meet the challenge of coeval
multiplicities that time and space should present us with. In the next
section I begin to unsettle the dominant rendition of time, space and
China in the world by way of reading it through the work of Jean
Baudrillard.

**Politics of harmonization eradicates that which presents itself as an
alternative option ordering the world into hierarchies of difference.
The formulation of politics in this manner pits the insiders versus the
outsiders promoting perpetual antagonism within the populous.**

**Nordin 16 (Astrid, "Futures beyond 'the West'? Autoimmunity in China's
harmonious world", Review of International Studies, 42, pp 156-177,
January 2016)**

[The]{.underline} party-state [version of harmonious world has then been
deployed to 'do' various concrete things in Chinese international
politics. At the level of imagining difference, it appears to share our
concern here with multiplicity and openness]{.underline}. However,
groups and cultures are described in ways that correspond with David
Kerr's 'blending diversity under universalism', which tends towards an
imagination of difference as hierarchically ordered, and sometimes as
something that should be eliminated[. The future harmonious world is
envisaged as an 'inevitable choice', and China is imagined as having a
privileged position in the construction of this future because of its
purported harmonious nature based on history. It is inevitable, yet
needs to be constructed and fostered. Against this background,
'harmonious world' is said by some to indicate 'an increasingly
confident China relinquishing its aloofness to participate and undertake
greater responsibilities in international affairs'. Nonetheless, the
term remains to a significant extent a 'catch all' phrase of friendly
connotations]{.underline}. 'Harmonious world' may be useful precisely
because of its vague and elusive implications, that nonetheless speak to
both Chinese and non-Chinese sensibilities[. Indeed, 'who could argue
against global peace and prosperity]{.underline}?' Nonetheless, [what
emerges from accounts of harmony as articulated in China in the last
decade is a tension in the harmony concept between its need for
multiplicity on the one hand, and its presupposition of
universalisability on the other.]{.underline} Bart Rockman has suggested
that [harmony may be a 'necessary glue without which neither a society
nor a polity are sustainable', but that 'complete social harmony is
ultimately suffocating and illiberal'.]{.underline} Jacob Torfing has
also taken issue with predominant understandings of harmony in Southeast
Asia that he argues present a ['post-political vision of politics and
governance that tends to eliminate power and antagonism']{.underline}.
Drawing on Laclau and Mouffe, he understands such [a post-political
vision as both theoretically unsustainable and politically
dangerous]{.underline}. It is unsustainable because power and antagonism
are inevitable features of the political dimensions of politics.
Therefore [politics: cannot be reduced to a question of translating
diverging interests into effective]{.underline} \[win-win\] p[olicy
solutions, since that can be done in an entirely de-politicized fashion,
for example, by applying a particular decision-making rule, relying on a
certain rationality or appealing to a set of undisputed virtues and
values.]{.underline} Of course, politics always invokes particular
rules, rationalities and values, bu[t]{.underline} [the political
dimension of politics is precisely what escapes all this. Politics,
then, unavoidably involves a choice that means eliminating alternative
options]{.underline}. Moreover, [although we base our decisions on
reasons and may have strong motivations for choosing what we choose, we
will never be able to provide an ultimate ground for any given
choice]{.underline} -- in Derridean terms, such grounds will always be
indefinitely deferred. Therefore, 'the ultimate decision will have to
rely on a skillful combination of rhetorical strategies and the use of
force'. [The acts of exclusion that politics necessarily entails will
produce antagonism between those who identify with the included options
and those who do not]{.underline}. For this reason, [the attempt by the
promoters of harmony to dissociate harmonious politics from the exercise
of power, force and the production of antagonism, claiming a harmony
where everyone wins and no-one looses, is bound to fail.]{.underline}
Moreover, the post-political vision of politics and harmony is dangerous
because its denial of antagonism will tend to alienate those excluded
from consideration. This, Torfing writes, [will tend to displace
antagonistic struggles from the realm of the political to the realm of
morals, 'where conflicts are based on non-negotiable values and the
manifestation of "authentic" identities']{.underline}. Such
non-negotiable values would be the opposite of the cooperative harmony
sought. To both Rockman and Torfing, then, complete or perfect harmony
will defeat harmony and create disharmony. In this way, the excessive
production of harmony is what produces the disharmonious elements that
come to threaten it. [We can see this happening in contemporary China,
where the 'harmonising' policies enforced under the 'harmonious society'
slogan have produced a range of oppositional movements, from Chinese
youth mocking harmony online to the increasing number of selfimolations
we currently witness in and around Tibet]{.underline}. Numerous scholars
argue that in order [to imagine harmony, we need to imagine
heterogeneity and multiplicity]{.underline}. We can now add that the
problematic organisation of [difference that remains in imaginations of
harmonious world eliminates the multiplicity in the here-now that is a
prerequisite for harmony]{.underline}. What these renditions of harmony
show, I believe, is that the tensions in and logics of harmony are very
similar to the ones that are described by Derrida and others in terms of
the autoimmune. [What we see in these accounts is an irresolvable
contradiction]{.underline}, which mirrors the autoimmune logic outlined
at the beginning of this article. [Harmony must by definition be
universal, but its universalisation by definition makes harmony
impossible. In this respect harmony works on a self-defeating and
self-perpetuating logic that is very similar to what we saw described in
the 'modern West' and in 'democracy'.]{.underline}

#### The world no longer operates through the logic of nation building, but rather the over profusion of simulation - the expo was not isolated to Shanghai, the entire globe is a world fair -- a harmonius simulation of international coherence where countries are isolated spatial and cultural totalities, where the distinctions between [visiting]{.underline} the expo and [being]{.underline} the expo are blurred until all notions of subject are rendered incoherent, copies of copies without originals, simulacra avatars in a virtual hyper-reality -- This is the expo; have fun at the American pavilion!

TAKING BAUDRILLARD TO THE FAIR Above, I have examined different ways in
which China is imagined as ahead in the historical queue that is posited
at Expo 2010. However, as explained in the introduction to this thesis,
a most common way of imagining China elsewhere in discourse on the
country's relation to the world is as behind, or catching up. This way
of understanding China's role in international politics has its roots in
an imagination of Chinese experience as radically different to that of
Western modernity -- as the "other country" (Chow, 1991: 81). [In recent
years a key Chinese strategy for negotiating both its claims to
particularism and to being a modern great power has been through the
public diplomacy of "mega events", including Exp 2010.]{.underline} The
success of Chinese mega events in altering international opinion is
debatable (Manzenreiter, 2010: 29-48). [As symbols of a changing Chinese
identity and outlook they have nonetheless come to be understood as an
important aspect of Chinese "image management"]{.underline} (Xin Xu,
2006; Brownell, 2008; Price and Dayan, 2008). In this section I argue
that [we need to take the next step and understand China's mega events
not only on the level of representation and ideology, but also on the
level of simulation and simulacra.]{.underline}106 I moreover argue that
a consequence of [such a reading is that we need to stop imagining China
as the "other country".]{.underline} Mega event genres came about in
Western industrialising capitalist countries engaged in nation building
and imperial consolidation of the late 19th century (Rydell, 1984: 8,
236; Roche, 2003: 100). Maurice [Roche has connected mega events as a
phenomenon to "a temporal world view framed in terms of 'progress,' the
assumed responsibility to build a diffuse western 'civilisation,' and
the assumed capacity to do so by actively 'making history']{.underline}"
(Roche, 2003: 103, see also Roche, 1999: 1-31). He has further suggested
"[mega-events are potentially memorable because they are a special-kind
of time-structuring institution in modernity]{.underline}" (Roche, 2003:
102, emphasis in original). Like Roche, I examine how [time and
modernity are negotiated by a mega event, but rather than looking for
this time-shaping capacity in the scale and cyclical occurrence of
events I examine one particular event, that is Expo 2010.]{.underline}
World fairs have been described as instrumental in creating the
distinction between reality and representation, a dualism that has
become central to the way we capture the modern world (Mitchell, 1988;
Harvey, 1996). In the remainder of this chapter I 106 Penelope Harvey
has begun the work of reading world fairs as simulacra in
Hybrids4of4Modernity:4
Anthropology,4the4Nation4State4and4the4Universal4Exhibition (1996).
Recent publications have hinted at the possibility of such a reading of
Chinese mega events. Most notably, Price and Dayan's Owning4the4
Olympics4takes off in an imaginary of the Beijing Olympics as
"spectacle, festival, ritual, and finally as access to truth" and
concludes: "Or should we rewrite MacAloon's sequence in a style inspired
by Baudrillard: 'spectacle, festival, ritual, and finally...
simulacrum-'" (Dayan, 2008: 400). To my knowledge none have followed
through with an empirical analysis of what such a reading may look like
in the Chinese case. explore what happens when we read the world fair --
symbol of modernity -- through the work of Jean Baudrillard -- symbol of
postmodernity. [I suggest that we read Expo 2010 not only as an exercise
of nation-building, but as shaping also the imaginary of the world as a
holistic unit. Expo 2010 could easily be read as a representation of the
world, as mimicry or a fake version of the real world beyond its gates.
I read it instead as simulation.]{.underline} My key claim is that [the
world fair is everywhere, that in fact the world is a fair,]{.underline}
and that this has serious consequences for the study thereof. The
[reading of the world fair as simulacrum]{.underline} shows how [we may
be mistaken to imagine Chinese experience as radically other to that of
Western modernity, or postmodernity for that matter. It provides a
different way of thinking about space, time and
subjectivity.]{.underline} Importantly, I argue that Baudrillard, who is
often accused of being intellectually uncritical or irresponsible (for
example by Norris, 1992), can help us think differently about
intellectual strategy in our study of such a simulacral harmonious world
fair. I first outline Baudrillard's discussions of the simulacrum and
use this discussion to interrogate the "being" of the world fair. I
argue that [the fair is not a fake copy of a "real" world, but that as
simulation it marks the breakdown of the distinction of the copy from
the original, of the fair from the world. Having asked where the fair
is, arguing that fairness is everywhere, anywhere and
nowhere]{.underline}, I next ask when the fair is. I show that the fair
works through recycling, revival and reuse. I thereafter ask who is the
fair through an exploration of what happens to subjectivity in the
interactive technologies of the fair. I examine how our simulation as
subjects and objects of interactive technologies breaks both of these
categories down. I argue that [being in the world fair turns us into
simulacral avatars, circulated in virtual hyper-reality.]{.underline} I
finally conclude through asking how to be fair in such a simulacral
world fair. I argue that thinking the world in terms of its simulacral
fairness does not need to rob us of intellectual strategy, but that we
can draw on Baudrillard to think of theory as challenge. To be
simulacral, or where is the fair- Let us return to Baudrillard's claim
that [the world we live in has passed into the hyper-real, "the
generation by models of a real without origin or reality"]{.underline}
(Baudrillard, 1994 \[1981\]: 1). What has been lost, he argues, is
metaphysics: "\[n\]o more mirror of being and appearances, of the real
and its concept" (1994 \[1981\]: 2). Crucially, this is not a question
of imitation, duplication or even parody, but of substitution. [As a
consequence the real will never again have a chance to produce itself,
but is replaced by a "hyper-real" where there is no distinction between
the real and the imaginary, "leaving room only for the orbital
recurrence of models and for the simulated generation of
differences"]{.underline} (1994 \[1981\]: 3). What is at stake in
Baudrillard's analysis, then, is the reality principle: \[t\]o
dissimulate is to pretend not to have what one has. To simulate is to
feign to have what one doesn't have. One implies a presence, the other
an absence. But it is more complicated than that because simulating is
not pretending ... Therefore, pretending, or dissimulating, leaves the
principle of reality intact: the difference is always clear, it is
simply masked, whereas simulation threatens the difference between the
'true' and the 'false,' the 'real' and the 'imaginary' (Baudrillard,
1994 \[1981\]: 3). [In few places is the question of the real and the
imaginary, the true and the false, the original and the fake as
pertinent and as sensitive as in contemporary China. The lack of respect
in China for copyright]{.underline} is a frequent bone of contention in
its foreign relations. Domestic relations have been shaken in recent
years by the "tainted milk" scandal, where a number of infants were
killed and hundreds of thousands fell ill from ingesting "fake" milk
powder containing melamine (Barriaux, 2011). In IR, voices are raised
that worry about Westerners [underestimating the "China threat" because
China may be faking it, "a wolf in sheep's clothing" (]{.underline}Gang
Lin, 2005: 1). [Expo 2010 was a highly controlled space, yet it too had
its own associated scandals of fakery]{.underline}. Some suggested that
Expo 2010's mascot, Haibao, was a resurrection of American cartoon
character Gumby, dubbing it "The Gumbygate scandal" (V Saxena, 2010).
[The Chinese national pavilion was exposed to similar allegations of
plagiarism, facing claims that it looked a lot like the Japanese
pavilion]{.underline} from the 1992 Seville Expo, and equally similar to
the Canadians pavilion at Montreal in 1967. [The biggest diplomatic
scandal, nonetheless, surrounded the promotional tune Waiting for You
which was officially written for Expo 2010, its video featuring
all-Chinese superstars like Jackie Chan and Yao Ming. A scandal erupted
as it was revealed to bear an uncanny resemblance to Mayo Okamoto's 1997
Japanese hit Stay the Way You Are.]{.underline} The irony was not lost
on foreign commentators, with one commentator noting: \[i\]f the
Shanghai Expo is the ultimate showcase of an economy roaring to world
dominance, then the organizers have selected a theme song that perfectly
captures China on the cusp of the 21st century: strident, stirring --
and ripped off (Lewis, 2010). The composer of the fair tune first
strongly denied plagiarism allegations. Expo 2010 organisers thereafter
suspended all use of the song citing "copyright reasons" and after "a
flurry of face-saving efforts" Expo 2010 organisers, without admitting
any problematic recycling, asked if they could please use Okamoto's
work. The songwriter, whose practically forgotten tune had suddenly
returned to the top of Japanese charts, selflessly acquiesced (Lewis,
2010). These revelations of scandalous fakery, whether on the low level
of song writing or the high level of lethal state violence, are
typically understood as a form of resistance. They are taken to reveal
the real4state of affairs. Some commentators extrapolate fakery to a
"Chinese characteristic", portraying resistance to elite-led fakery as a
resistance to power. In a short film on Chinese netizens and state
power, blogger Wang Xiaofeng comments on Chinese fakes, with video shots
of the Expo interspersed: China is a country who likes to make fake
things. Lying is a virtue (美德) of the Chinese. This is evident in all
kind of matters. Statistical numbers are fake (假的) and whatever we
create, even the good things, are fake. They \[the PRC government\] must
say that some other countries are worse than China, to make common
people (老百姓) think that China is the best place to live in
(最好的国家). [The existence of mainstream media is based on this
process of the never-ending creation of fake.]{.underline} And [the
government itself is constantly creating this 'fake'.]{.underline} If
you go to remote places in China you discover very shocking realities,
people can't even find something to eat, but you still think this
country is a great country. So when you want to know the facts and get
information you are actually challenging power. They are afraid of this
(Wang Xiaofeng in Marianini and Zdzarski, 2011). [The claim of the
denouncers of scandalous fakery is that reality is being
masked]{.underline}, and the purpose of denunciation is to reveal this
reality through exposing fakery. My claim in the reminder of this
chapter, and in this thesis, is that [the distinction between the real
and the fake of the harmonious world is disappearing in a system of
self- referential signs.]{.underline} Through this process: [the whole
system becomes weightless, it is no longer itself anything but a
gigantic simulacrum -- not unreal, but a simulacrum, that is to say
never exchanged for the real, but exchanged for itself, in an
uninterrupted circuit without reference or circumference]{.underline}
(Baudrillard, 1994 \[1981\]: 5-6). In this respect, simulation is very
different from representation.107 The way the latter is often used
implies an equivalence of the sign and the real -- even if it is a
utopian equivalence. Simulation, on the contrary: stems from the Utopia
of the principle of equivalence, from the radical negation of the sign
as value, from the sign as the reversion and death sentence of every
reference. Whereas representation attempts to absorb simulation by
interpreting it as a false representation, simulation envelops the whole
edifice of representation itself as a simulacrum (Baudrillard, 1994
\[1981\]: 6). As outlined in chapter 2, Baudrillard explains this in
terms of successive phases of the image that I reiterate here:108 \[1\]
it is the reflection of a profound reality ... \[2\] it masks and
denatures a profound reality ... \[3\] it masks the absence of a
profound reality ... \[4\] it has no relation to any reality whatsoever:
it is its own pure simulacrum (Baudrillard, 1994 \[1981\]: 6). [The
shift "from signs that dissimulate something to signs that dissimulate
that there is nothing" is crucial because the real is no longer what it
once was. This]{.underline} is the 107 Problematising the dichotomizing
relationship between the sign and the real is, of course, by no means
originary with Baudrillard, but has a long and varied tradition from
Friedrich Nietzsche (1999 \[1872\]) to Derrida (1981 \[1972\]). 108 As
explained in chapter 2, [we need not read Baudrillard's successive
phases of the image as aligned in linear time. The "era of
simulation"]{.underline} (1994 \[1981\]: 2) [need not be understood as
temporally fixed or discreet.]{.underline} significance of simulation,
and its key effect is that in place of "the truth" we have a myriad of
truths taking the shape of signs of reality and myths of origin
(Baudrillard, 1994 \[1981\]: 6). Baudrillard uses the example of
Disneyland to model the "entangled orders of simulacra" because he sees
it primarily as a play of illusions and fantasy (Baudrillard, 1994
\[1981\]: 12). [The adults' parallel to Disneyland in the contemporary
era is the world fair, the most recent, the biggest, the most expensive
and the most visited of which, again, was Expo 2010.]{.underline}4Like
Disneyland, [Expo 2010 is built up of fantasm and as one of its feature
books announces "100 years of Expo dream"]{.underline} (Shanghai
shibohui shiwu xietiaoju, 2009). At the same time, as will be seen in
this chapter, Expo 2010 involved truth claims in an explicit way that
Disneyland never has, which makes it pertinent to examining both 1st and
2nd phase images and those of the 3rd and 4th phase. [Expo 2010 was
constructed as a simulacrum of the world in ways that mix dreams with
truth claims]{.underline} (and, as I have argued above, the claims that
the dreams are indeed the true dreams of humanity and that these dreams
will come true). Just like Disneyland, the Expo is ideological: digest
of the Chinese way of life, panegyric of Chinese values, idealised
transposition of a contradictory reality. Nonetheless, [the
"Chineseness" of Expo 2010 can be overemphasised in a format that is all
about recycling.]{.underline}109 As Penelope Harvey writes: \[i\]n many
ways the form of the great exhibitions has been maintained despite the
changing economic, social and political circumstances. Nation states
displayed cultural artefacts and technological expertise in their
individual pavilions, seeking to educate and entertain the visiting
public. The obligations of the organizers of a fair with universal
status are less concerned with the actual bringing together of
exhibitors from all over the globe than with enacting a theme that
simultaneously promotes the unity of mankind and the uniqueness of
individual societies (Harvey, 1996: 35). [The nation state has been the
key cultural, political and economic unit through which both IR and
world fairs have traditionally told the tale of global community, and
Expo 109 Indeed, this paper, too, works through recycling]{.underline}
(of Baudrillard, Harvey, Expo 2010) [and intentionally so.]{.underline}
2010 recycles this conceptualisation. As I argue above, [the spatial
organisation of the Expo sites, in Shanghai and online, is a starkly
visual simulacrum of the purported organisation of the international
state system. Essentialised culture is encapsulated in the spatial
containers that are Expo pavilions, which in turn are encapsulated in
continents or regions, which in turn are a subdivision of the neatly
bounded and mapped world fair. These mappings are presented as neutral
and innocent, helpful and real -- some lines on a surface, fair and
square]{.underline} (Expo Shanghai Online, 2010d). This particular model
depends on a metaphor of scale by which the international community
reproduces the form of its constituent parts: "\[b\]oth part and whole
function as self-contained, coherent, bounded entities which are mutual
transformations of each other through simple principles of aggregation
and disaggregation" (Harvey, 1996: 50). [This imaginary reproduces units
that differ from each other, but through a difference that is one of
equivalence. Whether we think of these units as natural or culturally
constructed, they are defined by precise boundaries in temporal, spatial
and cultural terms, they are distinct but equivalent
entities.]{.underline} This model of equivalence by difference was
highly visible at Expo 2010 as at previous world fairs (Harvey, 1996:
51). The world fair appears as a taxonomisation of equivalent national
units with their own pavilion, listing in official guidebooks and
dedicated day of cultural display. The official Opening Celebration of
Expo 2010 saw the parading of national flags, carried by Chinese youth
made up to look as repetitions and copies of each other (CCTV
Documentary, 2010). In this way Expo 2010 recycled the form of Expo 1992
in Seville on which Harvey writes: \[t\]he Expo provided a concrete
instance of endless replication, a cultural artefact built as if to
demonstrate the possibilities and limitations of an entirely consumerist
world. Thus there was the appearance of choice, of multiple
perspectives, yet the cultural forms on show were nevertheless clearly
reformulations and repetitions of each other and of previous events.
Sameness and familiarity undermined the promise of difference (Harvey,
1996). What we learn from Baudrillard is that this second phase ideology
moreover "functions as a cover for a simulation of the third order \[or
phase\]: Disneyland exists in order to hide that it is the 'real'
country, all of 'real' America that is Disneyland" (Baudrillard, 1994
\[1981\]: 12). [The world fair, in this vein, exists in order to hide
that it is the "real" world, all of the "real" world that is the
fair.]{.underline} The presentation of the Expo world as imaginary and
as a dream functions to make us think that the rest is real. [The world
fair takes us further than Disneyland does, as it is not content with a
country, but must simulate the world -- always striving to be more
inclusive, with Expo 2010 priding itself on including pavilions of more
countries than ever before, an inclusion which cost the PRC government
large sums in the form of subsidies]{.underline} (Xinhua, 2010e). In
this way Expo 2010 marks a shift from ideological nation-building to
worlding by simulation. Shanghai, China and the world that surround the
Expo are no longer real, but hyper-real, belonging now to the order of
simulation: "\[i\]t is no longer a question of a false representation of
reality (ideology) but of concealing the fact that the real is no longer
real, and thus of saving the reality principle" (Baudrillard, 1994
\[1981\]: 12-13). The relation between Baudrillard's different phases or
orders -- those that dissimulate something and those that dissimulate
that there is nothing -- comes to the fore in the hyper-awareness and
self-reflexivity of Expo 2010, as it had begun to do in previous world
fairs (Harvey, 1996). There were frequent references to the self-
representations of previous world fairs, in TV programs, books and in
the "Expo museum" at Expo 2010 (see for example Shanghai shibohui shiwu
xietiaoju, 2009). [In many instances of its replication, the world fair
reflected on itself as the exhibition of the exhibition of the
exhibition without end, as world fair exhibiting world
fair.]{.underline} Key emblems, monuments and mascots of previous fairs
were brought together with the effect of appearing as self-referential
signs, as copies of copies, representations of representations without
original, signifiers of signifiers without signifieds, ad4 infinitum. In
this way: \[t\]he exhibition represents the world, provides contexts and
connections for an understanding of external realities, but its
reflexivity simultaneously confuses or confounds the distinction of
insider/outsider, representation and reality" (Harvey, 1996: 37). The
implication is one of implosion of the careful construct and of moving
to the fourth phase: "it has no relation to any reality whatsoever: it
is its own pure simulacrum" (Baudrillard, 1994 \[1981\]: 6). Therefore,
we must take the step beyond understanding how the exhibition represents
the world and grapple with how the harmonious exhibition is the world,
and the harmonious world the exhibition. [Reading the Expo through
Baudrillard thus turns the world into fair and the fair into the
world.]{.underline} As I will continue to show throughout this chapter,
the distinction between one as real or original and the other as fake or
copy can no longer be upheld. All4we4
have4are4versions4or4layers4of4the4harmonious4world/fair,4all4simulacra.
This is why I argue with this chapter that
we4need4to4take4the4step4and4study4it4as4such, rather than limit
ourselves to reading China's mega events purely on the level of
representation and ideology, upholding the reality principle. The layers
of simulacra are all world/fair, but cannot be4the fair in a fully
present way because Baudrillard, and others with him, have upset the
dichotomisation of presence and absence.110 For this reason, the
relation between the layers of simulacra is not that of a coherent
system, of stable exchange or of dialectics. The world/fair is
simultaneously nowhere and now here. To be recycled, or when is the
fair- I have asked in the previous section where the fair is and argued
that "fairness" is everywhere and anywhere -- that the world/fair is
simultaneously nowhere and now here. I turn next to the temporality of
simulacra in this formulation to ask when the fair is. Looking for the
world/fair somewhere and sometime beyond the dichotomisation of presence
and absence I argue that the fair works through recycling, revival and
reuse, that as a rem(a)inder, it is not new. What better place to start
than with beginnings and origins- "We require a visible past, a visible
continuum, a visible myth of origin, which reassures us about our end.
110 This problematique has been discussed among others by Jean-Luc Nancy
(1991 \[1983\]), Giles Deleuze and Felix Guattari (1988 \[1980\]) and
Derrida (1976 \[1967\]). - 159 - Because finally we have never believed
in them" (Baudrillard, 1994 \[1981\]: 10). [Beginnings were certainly
important to displays of China at Expo 2010. Throughout the Chinese
national pavilion and dozens of Chinese regional pavilions, China is
described as the origin of the world, echoing wider media and academic
discourse in China.]{.underline} Various Chinese regional pavilions also
pride China for figuring as the origin of (Chinese) civilisation. I use
brackets here because there is some discrepancy or ambiguity in terms of
communicating such messages to Chinese speaking and English speaking
audiences. In the Gansu province case, for example, which circles around
its "long history" of more than 8000 years of civilisation, a sign that
reads in English "Dadiwan Site in Qin'an County Believed to Start the
Chinese Civilization" in Chinese language simply reads "Civilization
begins -- Qin'an Dadiwan" (文明肇启). [This kind of slippage between
these terms appears throughout Expo 2010 and makes Chinese civilisation
appear coterminous with civilisation as such.]{.underline} This exhuming
of "Chinese civilisation" functioned as a cover for a simulation of the
second phase, as [an ideological tool that served to make the "5000
years of uninterrupted Chinese civilisation" appear real. This
uninterrupted history of harmony is part of the shift in legitimisation
of CCP rule from socialism to nationalism and "Chinese characteristics"
(]{.underline}Cheung, 2012; Billioud, 2011). Most importantly, however,
this exhumation took pride of place because of a dream, "behind this
defunct power that it tries to annex, of an order that would have had
nothing to do with it, and it dreams of it because it exterminated it by
exhuming it as its own past" (Baudrillard, 1994 \[1981\]: 10). IR
scholars are performing this same exhuming ritual when we dream of the
emerging "Chinese school" of IR theory as a radical alternative to "the
West".111 [The fascination with this Chinese school resembles that which
Baudrillard describes of Renaissance Christians with American Indians.
At the beginning of the Christian colonising movement existed an
instance of bewilderment at "the very possibility of escaping the
universal law of the Gospel"]{.underline} (Baudrillard, 1994 \[1981\]:
10). In this 111 This "West", on my understanding, is not real in the
first place and the breakdown of any hard line between inside and
outside makes such radical dichotomization fall apart. - 160 -
bewilderment we could either admit to the lack of universality of the
Law, or exterminate the evidence to the contrary. The conversion or
simple discovery of these different beings is usually enough, for the
Renaissance Christians as for scholars of IR, to slowly exterminate
them. [This tactic of discovery and conversion as a form of violent
extermination of others has been acknowledged elsewhere in IR
scholarship]{.underline} (Inayatullah and Blaney, 2004) [and it remains
a tactic in PRC policy towards its "internal others" in areas like Tibet
and Xinjiang.]{.underline}112 [Chinese policy towards its ethnic
minorities is presented as proof of the superiority of Chinese
civilisation: it produces more ethnics than the ethnics themselves were
able to do -- since the PRC state provides modern healthcare and
"scientific development" and exempts ethnic minorities from the one
child policy. Moreover the PRC state produces more ethnic ethnics than
they themselves had mustered.]{.underline} This promotion of Chinese
ethnic minorities through their regional pavilions lies at the heart of
Expo 2010, a base from which the Chinese national pavilion rises.
Everywhere, the ethnic is exotically reproduced, recycled and
rescreened. Everywhere happy, colourful and anachronistic "ethnics"
sing, dance and rejoice in the greatness of the motherland, as in the
Xinjiang pavilion ("a harmonious place"). This overproduction is a means
of destruction, a "promotion" and "rescue" which forms another step to
their symbolic extermination. Nonetheless, the Expo is highly self-aware
in its use of time. [As described above, it frequently uses clocks,
hourglasses and pendula to mark the countdown to horror scenarios of
planetary destruction in order to drum home its purported message of
"Better city, Better life". In places it moreover explicitly favours
"recycling" over "linearity".]{.underline} 112 This is particularly the
case in current PRC policy towards the Western "Autonomous Regions" of
Tibet and Xinjiang where "splittism" is considered a challenge to the
integrity of the PRC state (Barabantseva, 2011). - 161 - Figure 6: "A
linear model will result in excessive pollution and waste" (Source:
Astrid Nordin) The theme pavilion City4being uses similar metaphors to
Baudrillard to conceive of time, that of biological life cycles,
metabolism, circulation and recycling. These are said to be key to the
proper functioning of the system. This pavilion is evocatively
constructed as a sewerage system interspersed with circulating billboard
messages of interconnection. [It is explicit about its rejection of
linear models]{.underline}, as in a pair of diagrammatical signs of
which the first reads "A linear model will result in excessive pollution
and waste", and the second reads ["A cyclical model will feature greater
recycling and less waste".]{.underline} Figure 7: "A cyclical model will
feature greater recycling and less waste" (Source: Astrid Nordin) In
this way Expo 2010, like Baudrillard, engages directly with claims to
the end of history: [\[h\]istory will not come to an end -- since the
leftovers, all the leftovers -- the Church, communism, ethnic groups,
conflicts, ideologies -- are indefinitely recyclable ... History has
only wrenched itself from cyclical time to fall into the order of the
recyclable]{.underline} (Coulter, 2004). Through these examples we can
see the world/fair engaged in different phases of simulation, which can
be understood as dissimulating something, but also as dissimulating that
there is nothing. [In places, the world/fair appears unreflexive, as
attempting to reinstate the reality of its teleological progress. In
other aspects, however, its reflexive hyper-aware recycling seems to
show how "it has no relation to any reality whatsoever: it is its own
pure simulacrum" (Baudrillard, 1994 \[1981\]: 6). Not only, then, can
the world no longer be represented by the fair, but more importantly it
can no longer be fairly re-presented, it can no longer be made present
in time and space as some full or complete presence.]{.underline} As
such, it is not enough to remain within a simple framework of
representation and ideology in our analyses thereof, but [we need to
take the next step and start analyzing China's mega events also as
simulacra. The world/fair is simultaneously nowhere and now here. The
world/fair is recycled. To be screened, or who is the fair-]{.underline}
Having asked in previous sections where and when the fair is I turn to
the question of who is the fair. What happens to subjectivity in [the
interactive technologies of the world/fair]{.underline}- I argue that
[in an order of recycling, the technologies that make us simultaneously
subjects and objects make the distinction between subject and object
untenable with the effect of making these categories
unworkable.]{.underline} It is clear that our embodiment matters in the
world fair as it differentiates between ways of being in the world/fair
along lines of class, race, gender and so on. At the Shanghai Expo,
where well over 90% of visitors were Chinese, the ability to identify me
as a fair-skinned visitor from the outside made me an immediate part of
the exhibited exotica (my being fair made me the fair, so to speak. And
simultaneously the reverse was true, my fairness positioned me as though
outside the fair, observing it/them). But Expo 2010 goes much further in
making us part of the fair, through the layers of interactive
technologies by which the fair itself emerges. In the first instance, we
are an active part of this emergence, we can plan, steer and shape the
world/fair, we are the subjects of its emergence. Visitors are often
asked to actively participate in Expo 2010. Indeed, interactivity is a
key feature of many pavilions and different layers of the world/fair,
and one pavilion is expressly dedicated to displaying it. Here,
photographs from Expo 2010 and its preparation, submitted via the Expo
2010 website, are circulated on screens. Participants can also send
"blessings and wishes for Expo 2010" from various websites and have them
screened in the pavilion, surrounded by cards with wishes and blessings
written by its visitors. In a "wishing tree" we are encouraged to write
wishes on colourful paper, fold it into airplanes and throw it into an
artificial tree. In parallel, the Online Expo 2010 has many venues where
one's avatar can leave wishes, such as the Vanke pavilion or the
Expo4dream4home discussed above. On a multimedia display stand visitors
to Expo 2010 can arrange various building models and simultaneously a 3D
image of its layout will appear on a background wall, surrounded by
previous "excellent works". In this way, a sign for the multimedia
display tells us, "You could become one of the designers of a future
city". In Shanghai's own pavilion at Expo 2010 the "Shanghai forever"
image wall, consisting of revolving triangles and more than 15000
photographs featuring Shanghai, is a product of "mass participation and
joint creation" (公众参与，共同创作) intended to expound the "design
conception of 'New horizons forever'" (or in Chinese "Shanghai eternally
marches towards a new horizon", 上海永远迈向新天地). [Images of images
are everywhere and we can be their creators. Nonetheless, in subjecting
the world/fair to our gaze and our actions, we are simultaneously
subjected by it. Our bodies are not only in the world/fair, they are the
world fair, as the fair is our bodies, simultaneously watching and
watched, displaying and displayed.]{.underline} Often our recognition as
participants rests on our willingness to take on specific subject
positions -- tellingly, the English title of the pavilion for popular
participation is "Citizens' initiative pavilion", interpellating us as
citizens of the mapped state system on display. It is through such
citizenship that we are allowed recognition in the world/fair. Indeed,
the different layers of simulacra share citizenship regimes as a key
feature, invoked through the passport. At previous world fairs, at the
Shanghai Expo, and at the online version of Expo 2010 we can have a
passport in which we collect "visa stamps" from the pavilions visited.
At points, we have to actively change ourselves to make us acceptable as
subjects in order to have our fair share. Passing through the world/fair
we are screened and tested. This screening echoes for the subject/object
dichotomy (the who) the collapse we saw in previous sections of the
here/there (the where) and the now/then (the when). As Richard Lane has
observed with regards to Baudrillard: there is an interpenetration of
the screen metaphor with the notion of everything being on the surface
here, including the 'friendly' surveillance which simultaneously shows
the people under surveillance on television screens, which leads to a
collapsing of perspectival space (the removal of the 'gap' or distance
both spatially and temporally between the viewer and the viewed) (Lane,
2000: 42). Here interpenetration is total, including of architectural
and geographical space. The layers of simulacra cannot be separated. All
of Expo 2010, the Shanghai Expo and its virtual replica, Shanghai,
China, all of the world/fair are indistinguishable "as a total
functional screen of activities" (Baudrillard, 1994 \[1981\]: 76). In
this way all of the world/fair operates through screening, in every
sense of the word. The example above of the excluded travel guide
moreover exemplifies how our participation in the citizenship regimes of
the world/fair is conditional -- she was stopped at the border because
she had not paid the fare. Indeed, the world/fair is most helpful in
persuading us that we can (and should) adjust our selves to pass its
screening. In a book dedicated to Expo etiquette prospective visitors to
the world/fair are most helpfully taught how to modify their behaviour
and their bodies (Xu Bo, 2009). Chinese readers can learn amongst other
things how to greet, walk, shake hands, sit, queue and care for their
personal hygiene in a polite manner. They can read about how to go to
karaoke, drink coffee with foreigners and host them in their home
according to global decorum. In an appendix we find a taxonomy of
etiquette, outlining customs country by country, from the US to Egypt
(2009: 147-71). One drawn image, for example, shows one man (who we can
assume, from the big nose in profile, is a Westerner) who sits nicely at
his table with one glass and one plate on which he is attacking a square
(perhaps a piece of toast) with his knife and fork. He looks with
bewilderment and a hint of fear at another man or boy who smiles a big
smile as he carries his second plate to the table, where he has already
assembled two glasses, various fruits and one more plate overflowing
with food (in the mish-mash of which we can identify various fruits, a
whole fish, a crab and some shrimp). The picture's caption instructs its
Chinese readers the civilised manner of partaking of the fare of the
fair through a rhyming slogan: "big eyes, small stomach, cannot finish
the delicious fare" (yan4da4duzi4xiao,4meiwei4chi4bu4liao 眼大肚子小，
美味吃不了) (2009: 62). The concluding chapter of the book, on "how to
be a refined and well mannered Expo person", clearly conceives of such
politeness in terms of the return to an original state. We are
encouraged to "utilize the Shanghai Expo as a historical turning point,
to make - 166 - every one of us change into politely speaking Expo
people" and after being told about "the Expo's demand on the etiquette
of the people of the host country" to "through the Expo make elegant
etiquette return to China" (2009: 141-6, emphasis added). Thus, being a
civilised citizen of the world/fair is not about being more like
somebody else, but about being more like your self; it is a question of
recycling. At other points, [moving through the world/fair our bodies
are more explicitly hi- jacked by screening, made to do things
potentially against our will]{.underline} (and indeed through or in
advance thereof), [proliferated, taken apart.]{.underline} The Ningxia
Hui Autonomous Region case for example shows visitors' images captured
and repeatedly displayed on screens. As citizens of the world/fair our
bodies are captured and displayed as copy upon copy throughout Expo
2010, media and academic work, including this thesis. Figure 8: Screened
in Ningxia autonomous region case (Source: Astrid Nordin) This hijacking
technology is not simply in the hands of states. Siemens powerfully
commoditised Chinese cultural heritage and the Chinese national
modernisation project in its Tianxia4yi4jia pavilion discussed above. To
English language audiences the pavilion was marketed through the name
We4are4the4world, a name which aptly brings out the recycling nature of
the fair through reviving Michael Jackson's old hit song, but [which
also showcases the ambiguity of the question "who is the world/fair".
The "we" is ambiguous and inside the pavilion the capacity in which "we"
become the world/fair is telling]{.underline} -- as described above, our
faces pass through a computer program and are recycled on screen as
avatars, transformed, singing along with the Expo 2010 theme tune. Our
avatars in the virtual version of Expo 2010 are, to some extent at
least, a consequence of our volition and choice, albeit screened and
monitored with a mandatory Chinese ID number registration. In Siemens'
corporate version of "All- under-heaven" we are the world/fair without
being told in what our stardom will consist. [Our avatars are exposed as
pre-programmed, as playing a pre-scribed role, and this play has only
one script, one where we all sing along with the Chinese
tune.]{.underline} From these examples we can see two kinds of
technologies operating in the world/fair: ones that represent the world
and ones that operate through simulation, "provoking a reflexive
awareness of artificiality and simulacra": \[t\]he first of these
conceives of technology as enabler, and is the concept that lies behind
the notion of the Expo as a technology of nationhood. Technology enables
a perspective that can produce wholeness from fragmentation. Expo
enables the appearance of the world as a whole, through the revelation
of the fragments that are cut from it and the apparent celebration of
their differences (Harvey, 1996: 123). [Expo 2010's use of interactive
technologies moved away from "representations" of the world as we know
it to be. It celebrated instead the possibility of producing a simulated
world, copies of copies (dis)interested in an original: a world of
images more real than the real, a fascination with the hyper-real,
pretensions to realities that were never there in the first place or at
least not in such perfect form, concrete manifestations of abstract
possibilities \[that\] produce the essence of life itself as outcome not
origin]{.underline} (Harvey, 1996: 123). The examples discussed here
reaffirm a rather sinister side to simulation: "\[[w\]e are living
through a movement from an organic, industrial society to a
polymorphous, information system -- from all work to all play, a deadly
game"]{.underline} (Haraway, 1991: 161). Through these technologies of
the world/fair, not only our concepts of spatiality and temporality, but
also our notions of subject and object, are displaced. Being in a
simulacral world/fair is simulacral being. As such, we need to move
beyond analyses of Chinese "mega events" through concepts of simple
representation and reality, and work to understand how they operate
through simulation and simulacra. [We are copies of copies without
original, simulacral avatars in virtual hyper-reality. The Expo is us:
our bodies, our dreams, our future.]{.underline}

#### Debate is disappearing in the proliferation of harmony -- the holistic spacitalization of the globe produces a domesticticated form of difference that eliminates the possibility for the truly Other-- harmony is not meaningless, but imbued with "hyper-meaning" -- more meaningful than meaningful, which paradoxically makes harmony terminate only its own disappearance -- we should engage in onco-operative logic to make possible coeval multiplicies that undermine the perfectibility of debate in a process that pushes through to its disappearance -- this is the only political act left -- bet on the form of[恶搞 (Ègǎo)]{.underline}

Conclusion: Futures of harmony and coeval multiplicities [Thinking about
multiplicity has remained a key conundrum for those who want to think
about global politics as truly political.]{.underline} One attempt at
managing and grappling with the opportunities and challenges that
multiplicity presents us with from "beyond the European imperium" has
been recent Chinese thinking about harmony and the concept of
"harmonious world" (Inayatullah and Blaney, 2004: ix). [This thesis is
to be read in the context of recently undertaken efforts to understand
this and other normative challenges to the way we imagine the times,
spaces and differences of the contemporary world. Its prime task has
been to scrutinise the way assumptions about time, space and
multiplicity play out in this challenge to what is perceived as Western
ways of imagining world order.]{.underline} With such a challenge in
mind, this thesis has embarked on a disruptive reading of the
multiplicity problematique in the "harmonious world" concept. THE
CONTINUED PROLIFERATION OF HARMONY Before moving on to discuss the
findings of this thesis and their implications for thinking
multiplicity, what for the immediate future of harmonious world- [The
term "harmonious world" has been written into the CCP constitution and
numerous official strategy documents. Foreign envoys to the PRC have
been taken on Confucius-themed trips by the Chinese state, accompanied
by a number of the academic promoters of harmonious world through whom
the envoys "acquired a deeper understanding of China's traditional
cultural philosophy such as 'seeking for harmony but not uniformity',
'living in harmony with all other nations']{.underline}" (Ministry of
Foreign Affairs of the PRC, 2011a). [The PRC establishment has also
urged other countries to be harmonious, recently for example in relation
to Vietnam]{.underline} (Xinhua, 2012d), [the Maldives]{.underline}
(Xinhua, 2012a) [and India]{.underline} (Xinhua, 2012b). "Harmonious
world" has moreover been well received by a number of foreign
dignitaries, and spread into their own language use. Leaders who have
recently used it in ways that resonate with the sinister side we have
seen to harmony include Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad (CNTV, 2012).
At the same time, it has not been given positive play only by alleged
"rogues" of the international arena, but by more widely accepted players
such as Kevin Rudd, Australia's former minister of foreign affairs. He
confidently declared, in a speech given to the Asia Society in New York
in 2012: "there is something in China's concept of a 'harmonious world';
which the US, the rest of the region and the rest of the world can work
with" (Rudd, 2012). [UN officials, such as Secretary-General Ban
Ki-moon, have also promoted harmony in official settings]{.underline}
(Xinhua, 2012c). Such endorsement has been played up by Chinese
officials, for example Li Baodong, Chinese permanent representative to
the UN, who refers to "the spirit of cultural diversity and harmony in
the world advocated by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and the United
Nations" (Xinhua, 2012e). ["Harmonious world" and the traditional
strategic culture with which it has been associated, then, has not only
been deeply entrenched in PRC policy documents, but has also been given
positive play by other influential individuals and
organisations.]{.underline} This supports Joseph Cheng's recent
expectation that it will remain a major element of Chinaʼs public
diplomacy in the foreseeable future: ["\[a\]s China pursues an
increasingly ambitious role in regional leadership and international
institution-building, its publicity work on building a ʻharmonious
worldʼ will likely be stepped up"]{.underline} (Cheng, 2012: 183). As
explained at the outset of this thesis, every generation of Chinese
leadership has used tifa to stamp their mark on Chinese politics. Xi
Jinping, who is expected to take over leadership after Hu Jintao in
2012, is not known as a great friend of Hu (he was not Hu's preferred
candidate for succession). We can therefore expect that Xi will
introduce other tifa during his time in leadership, and some may expect
a decline of "harmonious world" after he comes to power. [However, Xi
has also made use of the language of harmony in the run-up to his
take-over, for example when he headed a large Central Government
delegation to the Tibet Autonomous Region Between 17 and 22 July 2011,
for events to mark the 60th Anniversary of what the party-state calls
the "peaceful liberation of Tibet".]{.underline}155 Moreover, he was
responsible for the inauguration ceremony of the 2008 Beijing Olympics,
where harmony played a central role. For these reasons, it seems
reasonable to expect that Hu's stepping down from the presidency is not
the last we will hear of harmonious world in Chinese policy or academic
discourse (see Nordin, 2011: 17). [The cat-and-mouse game with online
dissidents also continues. A search for banned terms]{.underline} on
Sina Weibo on 2 November 2011 showed the term "蟹农场" (xienongchang) to
be censored. The term refers to a series of political cartoons with the
English name "Hexie farm". [This "hexie" refers to the double meaning of
harmony and rivercrabs, with the Chinese title using the term for "crab"
(xie 蟹) in this formulation. The cartoons focus on censorship and
violent promotion of harmonious policies and have become widespread
amongst other things through the China Digital Times
project]{.underline} (Hernandez, 2011; Hexie Farm, 2011). [New puns are
constantly created, then censored, giving rise to further new terms. The
rivercrabs have now morphed into new humorous "national treasure" words
that are deployed in egao culture online. One such replacement word for
harmony/rivercrabs is shuichan (水产), meaning "aquatic
product".]{.underline} Another is the evocative near-homonym hēxiě or
hēxuè (喝血), which means to "drink blood", an expression particularly
popular in Taiwan. [Through such terms, harmony/rivercrabs continue to
morph, metastasise and proliferate. In my examination of what
"harmonious world" does in terms of imagining time space]{.underline}
and multiplicity, I set out in this thesis to answer three
sub-questions. I will now return to each of these questions in turn, and
will make three key claims with regards to the doings of harmony. 155
For examples of Xi promoting harmony during the celebration, see the
full text (Xi Jinping, 2011a: 2, 3, 4) or a full length CCTV recording
(Xi Jinping, 2011b: 12:27, 24:06, 33:24) of his speech at the
anniversary ceremony . Xi's speech was also preceded by others stressing
civilizational harmony (wenming4hexie 文明和谐), and followed by a
parade displaying ethnic harmony and unity under the theme "building
harmony", as can be seen in additional CCTV recordings of the ceremony.
The broadcast ends by an assertion of the expected harmonious life of
ethnic unity under the central government (CCTV, 2011: 19:19, 20:20,
138:50, 147:14). - 217 - "HARMONIOUS WORLD" REPEATS AN ALLOCHRONISING
LOGIC The first question I asked in the introduction to this thesis was:
what are the assumptions behind and political consequences of different
ways of articulating "harmonious world", particularly in terms of
ordering time and space- With regards to this question, this thesis has
found that much of the official and academic discourse on harmonious
world deploys terms drawn from ancient Chinese thought. We have seen
particular emphasis on concepts drawn from pre-Qin texts, such as
"All-under heaven" (Tianxia4天下), "the kingly way" (wangdao4王道), "the
hegemonic way" (badao 霸道), "harmonism" (hehe4zhuyi4和合主义), and so
on. Yet, in the texts I [have examined on "harmonious world", these
terms are aligned with concepts of traditional "Western" IR and fall
back on the spatial categories of traditional IR theories. Through these
spatial categories, the debates reflect different ways of imagining the
space of a harmonious world. Some articulations rely on a unit-based
political cosmology, including civilizations, regions and most of all
bounded states. Others are based in holistic assumptions, deploying
IR-terms such as "network space", holistic globalisation]{.underline}
(specifically quanqiu4yitihua4全球一体化) [and an understanding of
Tianxia that similarly conceives of a space where everything is already
connected to everything else. Both of these ways of imagining space,
however, marry their spatialisations with conventional notions of
modernization and progress, or "turning the bad into the good", that
imply a linear or teleological time.]{.underline} Such imaginations
organise difference in epochs, and binaries such as advanced/behind,
modern/traditional, developed/developing and bad/good. [Through these
concepts multiplicity is aligned in a historical queue with Chinese
elites at the head. I have shown these terms and spatio-temporal
imaginings to reappear in party-state documents, academic writing and
the visualisations of harmonious world at Expo]{.underline} In all these
contexts, I have shown some of the things "harmonious world" does at the
level of ideology, as a second order simulacrum. At this level, the key
"doing" of harmonious world in the contexts I examined is the
allochronic organisation of time, space and multiplicity. This is
politically problematic because it reduces not only the challenge, but
the opportunity that time and space could and should present us with:
coeval multiplicities. This thesis thus presents a rebuttal of claims
that "harmonious world" and associated concepts such as
"All-under-heaven" and "the kingly way" present a better alternative to
more conventional ideas of world order. [Despite claims to the contrary,
they fail to escape the problematic organisation of difference that they
criticise in "Western thought".]{.underline} Through examining the
unit-based and holistic political cosmologies in academic discourse and
at Expo 2010 I have moreover contributed to a rebuttal of the idea that
these two imaginaries are mutually exclusive with one replacing the
other. I have shown instead that they are both deployed together in
contemporary China in ways that, although in certain tension, are
mutually supportive in underpinning an allochronic world imaginary.
[Therefore, although there is some tension between different terms and
spatialisations used to articulate harmonious world, the diversity of
accounts is undermined in that they all fall back on allochronising
assumptions. In that sense, what they all do is produce a domesticated
form of difference that denies an open future.]{.underline} Through
these findings this thesis intervenes in two fields. For students of
China and its foreign policy, it provides a rebuttal of some important
claims by Chinese scholars and policy makers. The most important
implication is that scholars must stop treating China as the "other
country". China is not "behind" as some infant being socialised, as
Johnston and others would have it. Nor is it a radical other to "the
West" that naturally escapes the problems of allochronic thought, as in
Chinese exceptionalist narratives. For scholars interested in time,
space and multiplicity in IR, and in the allochrony problematique in
particular, [this thesis provides a detailed study of a concept from
China, a context that has hitherto received less attention in these
debates than it merits. For these debates, it cautions against the
allure of China as an Other or alternative that escapes the traps of
allochronic thinking.]{.underline} HARMONISATION WILL NOT TAKE PLACE The
second question I asked in the introduction to this thesis was: what is
the overall effect of the proliferation of "harmony" in contemporary
Chinese society- After officially launching "harmonious world" in 2005,
the PRC party-state has continued spurring the concept's proliferation
in Chinese and international contexts. [Through the studies of this
thesis we have seen "harmonious world" amass so much meaning that the
possibility of using it as a meaningful concept has disappeared. Its
meaning has been shown to designate total co-operation, total
subjugation, total respect for difference, total control, totally moral
leadership, and so on. Where other scholars have tried to find out its
true meaning, I have shown instead how the illusion of this possibility
has disappeared -- not into meaninglessness, but into what we may by
Baudrillardean analogy think of as transparent or obscene
"hyper-meaning", the more meaningful than the meaningful. As an effect
of this mass proliferation the term has become overripe and collapsed
under the weight of its own meaning to the point where it can no longer
function as an ideal. The fantasy and the reality of harmonious world
have collapsed into one another and the seduction of the concept has
been lost. The proliferation of harmony has made it disappear as an
imagined metaphysical possibility. Harmonization has not taken place, is
not taking place and will not take place.]{.underline} This effect of
the proliferation of harmony, as a third order simulacrum of simulation
rather than second order ideology, is a key finding. Some scholars have
called for caution with regards to the oppressive, homogenising and
depoliticising aspect of Chinese harmonization. In the context of its
"hyper- meaning", resistance to harmony and harmonious world must be
thought of differently. [The threat posed by proliferating harmonisation
is not only the policing of boundaries that I describe on the level of
ideology: cracking down on dissidents, blocking words online, preventing
people from tweeting. Indeed, we might want to reflect on why many of us
are so obsessed with condemning the limitation of communication: will
the revolution really be tweeted- Instead, a more spectacular threat to
harmony comes from the excess of communicating harmony itself, which
destroys the illusion of the real in the harmony concept. In that sense
the mass- communication of harmony is dangerous on a larger metaphysical
plane.]{.underline} The CCP is working towards a controlled hierarchical
harmony, but it becomes something completely different. They are the
ones robbing harmony of its illusion. Baudrillard writes concerning the
Gulf War -- which he famously declared was not taking place -- that it
is stupid to be for or against the war if you do not for one moment
question its credibility or level of reality (Baudrillard, 1991).
[Therefore, those who promote the truth of it as a war and historical
event are the warmongers, the accomplices]{.underline} (Baudrillard,
1991; Merrin, 1994: 440). [On the same logic, it is misplaced to be for
or against harmony. We have seen various aspects of the "hyper- meaning"
of harmony and harmonisation]{.underline} (total co-operation, total
subjugation, total respect for difference, totally moral leadership,
total control). [None of these things are taking place in contemporary
China or its relations to the world. If something is taking place, it is
not harmony or harmonisation.]{.underline} My task here has not been to
promote or oppose this term, but rather to question its credibility and
indeed level of reality. This insight and its implications for
resistance is a key contribution of this thesis to both of the fields in
which I intervene. Moreover, through reading "harmonious world" in terms
of both its doing and its undoing this thesis suggests a novel way in
which scholars of Chinese international relations may study foreign
policy concepts in general and Chinese set phrases in particular. It
thus contributes to the literatures on "doing things with words" in
Chinese politics through emphasising ways of examining the undoings that
doings necessarily imply. It moreover contributes to literatures on
time, space and multiplicity in IR through showing how the thought of
Derrida and Baudrillard may help us shake up the manner in which
questions of multiplicity and politics can be formulated, and foreign
policy concepts can be studied in terms of excess. [That harmony is not
taking place, I stress once more, does not mean it does not have
effect]{.underline}s. Two academic commentators claim with regards to
its policy formulation that "it is implicit that a harmonious world is
one where supposed 'heresies' are tolerated" (Guo Sujian and Blanchard,
2008b: 4). Based on the finding that harmonious world repeats an
allochronising logic, I am less certain that such tolerance is implied
in - 221 - harmonious world. [Relegating "heresies" (or "others") to a
different time from our own means denying them coevalness in the
here-now. The implication in the texts I have examined is that "they"
will eventually come around to seeing the world as "we" do, which in
turn has depoliticising effects.]{.underline}THERE IS AN APORIA AT THE
HEART OF HARMONIOUS WORLD AND COEVAL MULTIPLICITIES The third and final
question I asked in the introduction to this thesis was: are there
contradictions in or between different articulations of "harmonious
world"- How are these made visible- I have argued above that the
diversity of more or less official accounts of a harmonious world is
undermined in that they all fall back on allochronising assumptions.
However, I have also shown how official language migrates and morphs in
different contexts through which "harmonious world" is undone --
resisted, deconstructed and changed -- by its very own logic. A reading
of China's mega events as simulacra of both the second and third order
(ideology and simulation) has revealed how notions of inside/outside,
now/then and subject/object come apart. Moreover, dissident play with
the concept of harmony makes visible certain contradictions, both
between different articulations of harmonious world and within the
concept itself. I began this thesis by outlining the two contradictory
imperatives of multiplicity, the threat and the promise of difference.
Throughout the examination of harmonious world, this term has revealed
itself as mirroring the aporetic imperatives of coeval multiplicity.
[Harmony must by definition be universal, but its universalisation by
definition makes harmony impossible.]{.underline} Bart Rockman has
suggested that harmony may be a "necessary glue without which neither a
society nor a polity are sustainable", but that "complete social harmony
is ultimately suffocating and illiberal" (Rockman, 2010: 207). Jacob
Torfing has also taken issue with predominant understandings of harmony
in Southeast Asia that he argues present a "[post-political vision of
politics and governance that tends to eliminate power and
antagonism]{.underline}" (Torfing, 2010: 257). Drawing on Laclau and
Mouffe, [he understands such a post-political vision as both
theoretically unsustainable and politically dangerous. It is
theoretically unsustainable because power and antagonism are inevitable
features of the political dimensions of politics, as I have described
the political]{.underline} (cf. Baudrillard, 1990 \[1983\]: 162, 182).
Therefore [politics: cannot be reduced to a question of translating
diverging interests into effective \[win-win\] policy solutions, since
that can be done in an entirely de- politicized fashion, for example, by
applying a particular decision-making rule, relying on a certain
rationality or appealing to a set of undisputed virtues and values. Of
course, politics always invokes particular rules, rationalities and
values, but the political dimension of politics is precisely what
escapes all this]{.underline} (Torfing, 2010: 257-8). [Politics, then,
unavoidably involves a choice that means eliminating alternative
options. Moreover, although we base our decisions on reasons and may
have strong motivations for choosing what we choose, we will never be
able to provide an ultimate ground for any given choice]{.underline} --
in Derridean terms, such [grounds will always be indefinitely deferred.
Therefore, "the ultimate decision will have to rely on a skilful
combination of rhetorical strategies and the use of force]{.underline}"
(Torfing, 2010: 258). [The acts of exclusion that politics necessarily
entails will produce antagonism between those who identify with the
included options and those who do not. For this reason, the attempt by
the promoters of harmony to dissociate harmonious politics from the
exercise of power, force and the production of antagonism, claiming a
harmony where everyone wins and no-one looses, is bound to fail.
Moreover, the post-political vision of politics and harmony is
politically dangerous because its denial of antagonism will tend to
alienate those excluded from consideration -- those who count as
"no-one" when everyone wins and no-one loses.]{.underline} This, Torfing
writes, will tend to displace antagonistic struggles from the realm of
the political to the realm of morals, "where conflicts are based on
non-negotiable values and the manifestation of 'authentic' identities"
(Torfing, 2010: 258). [Such non- negotiable values would be the opposite
of the co-operative harmony sought. To both Rockman and Torfing, then,
complete or perfect harmony will defeat harmony and create
disharmony.]{.underline} We have seen how numerous scholars argue that
in order to imagine harmony, we need to imagine heterogeneity and
multiplicity. We can now add that the allochronic organisation of
difference eliminates the multiplicity in the here-now that is a
prerequisite for harmony. In order to imagine heterogeneity and
multiplicity we need to delineate here and there, now and then in the
fathomable aspect of différance that enables us to think spacing between
multiple trajectories à la Massey. In other words, in order [to imagine
multiplicity we need borders and boundaries, or else all we have is the
unitary One. Such is language.]{.underline} Rockman goes on to argue
that although homogeneity of ascriptive identities like ethnicity,
[language or religion may enhance harmony, the more important factor for
constructing harmony is "the capacity to assimilate, absorb and
integrate perspectives to a common ground for accommodation of
diversity"]{.underline} (Rockman, 2010: 207). But [the point is that the
idea of a "common ground" can only be built on exclusion, that such
assimilation, absorption and integration is what reduces the otherness
of the Other to only fathomable, definable and co-operative
difference.]{.underline} To Baudrillard, it is [the modern West's
refusal of such alterity that spawns nostalgia for the Other, who is now
always already domesticated, a mass version of what we saw in
presentations of "ethnics" at Expo 2010 (]{.underline}Baudrillard, 1990
\[1987\]: 145, 165). [We have seen the same refusal of alterity in
Chinese discourses on harmonious world, with its focus on proper
understanding and the insistence on difference in order to make the
world "colourful". It is the same nostalgia and exhuming ritual that IR
scholars perform when dreaming of an emerging "Chinese school" of IR
theory as a radical alternative to "the West".]{.underline} Despite this
nostalgia, we must not try to "foster" difference. [It is
counterproductive to call for "respecting the difference" of
"marginalized groups", as this relies on a presumption that they need to
have an Identity and makes the marginal valued as such, thus leaving the
marginal where they are, "in place". Difference must therefore be
rejected, to some extent at least, in favour of greater otherness or
alterity]{.underline}: "otherness \[l'altérité\] is not the same thing
as difference. [One might even say that difference is what destroys
otherness]{.underline}" (Baudrillard, 1993 \[1990\]: 127, 131). Thus
"[the other must stay Other, separate, perhaps difficult to understand,
uncontrollable]{.underline}" (Hegarty, 2004: 118). In this way,
Baudrillard advocates more "exoticism", an interest in the other as
Other, and as beyond assimilation into "proper understanding" in the
present. To Hutchings this absence of a "proper understanding" of the
other in the present is no doubt disappointing, because other times are
indeed identified with an unpresentable supplement and thus with that
which cannot be known, but only hoped for. But [the Other can only
remain Other insofar as we resist the urge to attempt such assimilation.
The alternative would be to fall back into "the One" and loose sight of
the possibility of harmony and coeval multiplicities. What we have,
then, is an aporia at the heart of both coeval multiplicities and of
harmonious world, despite attempts to conceal it.]{.underline} I have
aimed through this thesis to question little by little the attempts at
harmonious organisation of time and space as belonging to the sovereign
that this concealment has implied. I have examined different strategies
of reading and using "harmony" in ways that reveal the excluded other of
Hu's harmony -- discord and competition -- to be always already there
within the political and linguistic system of harmony itself. I have
argued that [the harmonious system is not based on co-operation or non
co-operation, but works according to an onco-operative logic: the
quasi-suicidal logic of cancer and the (auto)immune]{.underline}.
Ultimately, [the aim and most important contribution of this thesis has
been to bring the onco-operative uncertainty of the political back into
the harmonious world concept in order to elucidate the negotiation of
danger and necessity of multiplicity.]{.underline} (IM)POSSIBLE COEVAL
MULTIPLICITIES; (IM)POSSIBLE HARMONY With regards to the main question
of this thesis, I thus make three interrelated claims about what
"[harmonious world]{.underline}" does. First, it repeats the
allochronising logic that we recognise from "Western" discourses.
Second, it [disappears as an imagined metaphysical possibility as an
effect of its excessive proliferation]{.underline}. Third, [when the
aporia at the heart of the harmony concept is recognised, it allows for
a re- politicisation of "harmonious world" and China's role in world
politics.]{.underline} I have argued that these findings make an
important contribution to both scholars of Chinese international
politics and to theorists of time, space and multiplicity in IR. But
where does this leave us- [A key effect of the onco-operative logic that
I have identified in "harmonious world" is undecidability. Harmony, as
simulation, is paradoxically both totalising and violent, and
impossible]{.underline} (cf. Grace, 2003). To begin, [its fetishised
perfectability is constantly undermined: \[t\]he perfect crime would be
to build a world-machine without defect, and to leave it without traces.
But it never succeeds. We leave traces everywhere -- viruses, lapses,
germs, catastrophes -- signs of defect, or imperfection]{.underline}
(Baudrillard, 1997: 24). Moreover, [contemplating the illusion of the
real reveals the object as neither the static, subordinated other of the
subject, nor the simulated project of an idealist order: the object that
is neither one thing nor the other is fundamentally
illusory]{.underline} (Grace, 2003). In Baudrillard's terms:
[\[i\]llusion is simply the fact that nothing is itself, nothing means
what it appears to mean. There is a kind of inner absence of everything
to itself. That is illusion. It is where we can never get hold of things
as they are, where we can never know the truth about objects, or the
other]{.underline} (Baudrillard in Baudrillard and Butler, 1997: 49).
Undecidables, then, cannot be reduced to opposition but reside within
opposition, in Derrida's words "resisting and disorganising it,
without4ever4constituting a third term" and thus without becoming
dialectical (Derrida, 1987 \[1972\]: 43, emphasis in original). [Such
undecidables exist neither simply inside metaphysical discourse and its
constitutive binaries, nor simply outside them. They work, instead, on
their margins and limits, disrupting and displacing them, as we have
seen rivercrabs do. This makes them "\[n\]either/nor, that is,
simultaneously, either/or"]{.underline} (Derrida, 1987 \[1972\]: 43,
emphasis in original). We can add to the previous discussion about the
times and spaces of undecidable harmony, and the potential I have
located in it for thinking coeval multiplicities, through drawing on
Derrida's discussion of auto-immunity in relation to the term renvoyer,
which means re-sending, sending away, sending back (to the source)
and/or sending on (Haddad, 2004: 37). Derrida explains that the
autoimmune process: consists always in a renvoi, a referral or deferral,
a sending or putting off. The figure of the renvoi belongs to the schema
of space and time, to what I had thematized with such insistence long
ago under the name spacing as the becoming-space of time or the
becoming-time of space. The values of the trace or of the renvoi, like
those of différance, are inseparable from it (Derrida, 2005 \[2003\]-a:
35, emphasis in original). [Thus, in onco-operative harmony the
(auto)immune topology in space demands that harmony be sent off
elsewhere, excluded, rejected. It must be expelled under the pretext of
protecting it, precisely by rejecting or sending off to the outside the
disharmonious elements inside it]{.underline} (cf. Derrida, 2005
\[2003\]-a: 35-6). As we have seen, such [exiling does not take place
only in democracy]{.underline}, as Derrida implied, [but also in
harmony.]{.underline} It is the expulsion of internal ills that has been
promoted by Hu's harmony and by both Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)
and biomedical approaches to cancer. It has been criticised by theorists
of time and space such as Fabian, Inayatullah and Blaney, Massey and
Hutchings. Moreover, "since the renvoi operates in time as well,
autoimmunity also calls for putting4off \[renvoyer\] until later
elections and the advent of democracy" (Derrida, 2005 \[2003\]-a: 36).
[So too does it postpone the coming of harmony. Here, truly "harmonious"
behaviour by the sovereign is postponed until later, until more
harmonious times. China needs to become strong first, be in control of
harmony on the inside first, use hard power first.]{.underline} This
renvoi reinforces my claim that there is no essence to harmony, no self
with which harmony can be self-same. To paraphrase Derrida, this double
renvoi (sending off -- or to -- the other and putting off, adjournment)
is an autoimmune fatality or necessity. [It is inscribed directly in
harmony, directly in or right onto the concept of a harmony without
concept, directly in a harmony devoid of self-sameness. It is a harmony
of which the concept remains free, out of gear, free-wheeling, in the
free play of its indetermination. It is inscribed directly in this thing
or this cause that, precisely under the name of harmony, is never
properly what it is, never itself. For what is lacking in harmony is
proper meaning, the very meaning of the selfsame, the it-self, the
properly selfsame of the it-self.]{.underline} It defines harmony, and
the very ideal of harmony, by this lack - 227 - of the proper and of the
selfsame (cf. Derrida, 2003b: 61; 2005 \[2003\]-a: 36-7). Again, in a
slightly different sense, harmony has not taken place, is not taking
place and will not take place. [The onco-operative Chinese system is not
only a process by which harmony attacks a part of itself]{.underline}.
This renvoi, moreover, consists in a deferral or referral to the other:
as the undeniable, and I underscore undeniable, experience of the
alterity of the other, of heterogeneity, of the singular, the not-same,
the different, the dissymmetric, the heteronomous (Derrida, 2005
\[2003\]-a: 38, emphasis in original). By undeniable, here, Derrida also
means that it is only deniable. The only way that it is possible to
protect meaning is through a sending-off (renvoi) by way of denial.
Harmony is differantial in both senses of différance. It is
différance,4renvoi, and spacing. This is why spacing, "the
becoming-space of time or the becoming-time of space" is so important.
(Derrida, 2005 \[2003\]-a: 38). Harmony, like democracy, is what it is
only in the différance by which it defers itself and differs from
itself. Harmony can never achieve the indivisibility that it claims as
its prerequisite. To the extent that it tries to do so, it must enforce
its law with violence (disharmony). In this sense, it is impossible.
But, the perceptive reader may ask, do the traces and cracks that make
harmony come apart not also appear in the argument of this thesis- Could
the same not be said about the argument that harmony is impossible-
Indeed. A successful failure. And the same is true for "coeval
multiplicities". This thesis has questioned whether it is possible to
imagine harmonious world in a way that allows for coeval multiplicities.
The temptation set up by this question is to answer in terms of the
dichotomy it implies: it is either possible, or impossible. [However,
the undoing of "harmonious world" I have examined exposes the need to
think otherwise about the dichotomy of possibility/impossibility and to
displace it.]{.underline} Following Derrida, both "[harmonious
world]{.underline}" and "coeval multiplicity[" are best conceived as
both possible and impossible, never simply one or the other. Any
harmonious or coeval relation to otherness is also always a
disharmonious and - 228 - allochronising relation. This deconstructive
undecidability, as I have argued, is not negative]{.underline} (as
Massey would have it). That harmony or coeval multiplicities are not
simply4possible is not an excuse to treat them as simply4impossible. The
aim of reading deconstruction or reversibility throughout this thesis
has been to reveal the contradictions and complexity that reside within
what we try to enact and make possible. [The purpose has been to show
that the post-political articulations of "harmonious world" do not hold
up, and to bring the political back into the harmony
concept.]{.underline} COEVAL MULTIPLICITIES AND HARMONY TO COME I have
argued that [harmonious world will not take place]{.underline}, I have
argued against its possibility, I have used it against itself, and
written an entire thesis with the express strategy to make it disappear.
Are [scholars then to resolutely reject harmony and harmonious world as
viable concepts in IR- Are students to retreat back to the comfortable
concepts and language that have a more established history in IR
literatures-]{.underline} Although it may appear paradoxical, [I want to
answer these questions with a resolute "no".]{.underline} [Again: that
harmony or coeval multiplicities are not simply possible is not an
excuse to treat them as simply impossible. It calls, instead, for the
opposite of abandoning harmony and coeval multiplicities. The point that
harmonious world is not uniquely liberating, but repeats the politically
problematic and allochronising logic of more established writing in what
is referred to as "Western tradition", simply means that it cannot
escape the restraints and problems recognisable in other terms.
Therefore, retreating to other (old, comfortable) terms is not a
solution. There are, however, some good reasons to continue discussing
harmony and harmonious world as important concepts of IR.]{.underline}
First, [although harmony has disappeared its proliferation has
not]{.underline}. As explained above, I believe that harmonious world
will remain a key concept to Chinese politics for some time yet. [This
in itself means we should keep engaging it.]{.underline} Second, I use
it in acknowledgement of a tradition and aspiration to a way of doing
things differently. Derrida's "democracy to come" is chosen in
acknowledgement of his debt to a historical and intellectual heritage.
As he claims in an interview concerning autoimmunity: \[o\]f all the
names grouped a bit too quickly under the category 'political regimes'
(and I do not believe that 'democracy' ultimately designates a
'political regime'), the inherited concept of democracy is the only one
that welcomes the possibility of being contested, of contesting itself,
of criticizing and indefinitely improving itself (Derrida, 2003a: 121).
I have shown that Derrida's claim that "democracy would be the name of
the only 'regime' that presupposes its own perfectibility" is highly
questionable (Derrida, 2003a: 121). There seems to be little impetus to
call the processes and ideas that I have examined "democracy" (despite
the CCP leadership's insistence that China is democratic). Yet, they
operate on the same (auto)immune or onco-operative logic that Derrida
takes as giving "democracy" its future, its "to come". I have argued
that "harmony" is onco-operative in a similar manner, and its legacy
should be recognised. Third, I want to retain the term "harmony" because
of its universalist implications (cf. Pin-Fat, 2010: 119-20). Its
universal claim that all conceivable elements of a situation need to be
in harmony for the situation to be harmonious conjures up the question
of exclusions and exceptions. [Despite itself, it invites questions
about what or who has been excluded, why and on what grounds. I
therefore take it as an invitation to question and challenge the
reality, precisely, of the divisions that deployments of harmony have
made visible to us. In the party-state's version of harmony, China's
future is an active programme, but importantly this future is described
through the oxymoron of "inevitable choice"]{.underline} (State Council
of the PRC, 2005b), [legitimised as rational due to the application of
China's "scientific outlook on development" and prescriptive of a future
where China will always stand for "fairness and justice]{.underline}"
(Hu Jintao, 2007). I have questioned such prescriptive narratives, in
order to open up to the undecidability of an unimaginable future for
harmonious world. [The reason that I have kept insisting on such
openness (autoimmunity, undecidability, the Other, and so on) is because
it makes the political, and indeed any futures at all,
imaginable]{.underline} (albeit in ways I shall qualify below). To
Derrida "\[a\] foreseen event is already present, already presentable;
it has already arrived or happened and is thus neutralized in its
irruption" (Derrida, 2005 \[2003\]-b: 143). Therefore, ["\[w\]ithout the
absolute singularity of the incalculable and the exceptional, no thing
and no one, nothing other and thus nothing, arrives or
happens]{.underline}" (Derrida, 2005 \[2003\]-b: 148, emphasis in
original). And again, "\[[w\]ithout autoimmunity, with absolute
immunity, nothing would ever happen or arrive; we would no longer wait,
await or expect, no longer expect one another, or expect any
event]{.underline}" (Derrida, 2005 \[2003\]-b: 152, see also 157). This
is why Derrida insists on the future "to come" (avenir/à4venir). In
accordance with my argument for (im)possible coeval multiplicities, this
places focus on what comes, rather than that which begins from the self
or the One. Chinese language has the same connotations of the future as
that which comes, where the character lai 来, meaning precisely "to
come", is part of the term for future, weilai 未来. This places it in a
chain of meanings of the "to come" as "future" (weilai4未来 or jianglai4
将来), "return" (huilai4回来), and "originally" (yuanlai4原来). This
echoes with the spectral temporality discussed in this thesis, where the
future is to come as a return of the other that is also its (non)origin.
As we have seen weilai, the future, was itself harmonised in conjunction
with Ai Weiwei's detention, making it deferred in more than one sense.
[Through these ways of rethinking harmony, we see how the undecidability
at work in the very concepts of harmony and coeval multiplicities leaves
open the chance (or threat) of a future, for both the terms themselves
and for responsibility and singular decisions to be taken beyond
masterful sovereignty. This future is not just in the future, something
we can hope for, but it imposes itself with absolute urgency in the form
(or form-beyond-form) that the imperative of harmony takes here and now.
Because of its onco-operative (im)possible character, "harmony" is
structurally open to the other -- an other that does not await us as the
unified ideal of a programmable or predictable future, but that presses
upon us (with all the force of its self-difference) in the
"here-now"]{.underline} (cf. Wortham, 2010: 131-2; Derrida, 1994). [My
point of retaining the (im)possibility of a harmony to come is partly
about retaining the term "harmony", but it is also about opening up to
the possibility of its continued destruction. By opening itself up to
the other, harmony threatens to further destroy itself, but also gives
it the chance to receive the other -- in the here-now, in coeval
multiplicity. The point of the "to come" is a future that cannot be
identified in advance, since it would break with all the old names.
Without countries, civilizations, progress, we may ask whether it would
still make sense to speak of harmonious world under that name, or indeed
of coeval multiplicities in world politics. As a term, then, "harmony"
is not sacred, neither is "coeval multiplicity"]{.underline}. Some other
context, some day, may demand that we use a different word in other
sentences (cf. Derrida, 2002: 181). [Just as the PRC state (or indeed
any state) works on an onco-operative logic, so too does language
attempt to remain immune to anything that may threaten its logical
syntax]{.underline}. This is a necessity for language to make sense.
[The definition of a term, by definition, is a border and immune
protection from what it is not, but we can read its simultaneous
auto-immunity through reading deconstruction. Therefore, at the same
time as the future is unpredictable, it is at work today, in
onco-operative harmony and coeval multiplicities: it is what is coming,
what is happening. The responsibility for what remains to be decided or
done cannot consist in following rules, rites or proper conduct of
harmony, nor in a prescriptive theory for how to think and write coeval
multiplicities, but must remain within the realm of the
political.]{.underline}

#### China and the world are no longer real, but hyperreal. We need to take the next step and start analyzing China's Mega events as simulacra. 

**Nordin 12.** Astrid Nordin, Lecturer in the Department of Politics,
Philosophy, and Religion at Lancaster University, PhD in Chinese
International Politics, "Taking Baudrillard to the Fair: Exhibiting
China in the World at the Shanghai Expo", Alternatives: Global, Local,
Political, Volume 37, Number 2, May 2012, pg. 106-120

Expo 2010 was constructed as a simulacrum of the world in ways that mix
dreams with truth claims (and the claims that the dreams are indeed the
true dreams of humanity and that these dreams will come true).29 Just
like Disneyland[, the Expo is ideological: digest of the Chinese way of
life, panegyric of Chinese values, idealized transposition of a
contradictory reality.]{.underline} Nonetheless, the \"Chineseness\" of
Expo 2010 can be overemphasized in a format which is all about
recycling, 30 as Penelope Harvey writes: In many ways the form of the
great exhibitions has been maintained despite the changing economic,
social and political circumstances. [Nation states displayed cultural
artefacts and technological expertise in their individual pavilions,
seeking to educate and entertain the visiting public.]{.underline} The
obligations of the organizers of a fair with universal status are less
concerned with the actual bringing together of exhibitors from all over
the globe than with enacting a theme that simultaneously promotes the
unity of mankind and the uniqueness of individual societies.31 The
nation state has been the key cultural, political and economic unit
through which both IR and world fairs have traditionally told the tale
of global community, and Expo 2010 recycles this conceptualization. The
spatial organization of the Expo sites, [[in Shanghai and online, is a
starkly visual simulacrum of the purported organization of the
international state system]{.underline}. [Essentialised culture is
encapsulated]{.underline}]{.mark} [in the spatial containers that are
Expo pavilions, which in turn are encapsulated [in continents or
regions, which]{.mark} in turn [are]{.mark} a subdivision of the [neatly
bounded and mapped]{.mark} world fair]{.underline}. These mappings are
presented as neutral and innocent, helpful and real -- some lines on a
surface, fair and square.32 This particular model depends on a metaphor
of scale by which the international community reproduces the form of its
constituent parts: \"Both part and whole function as self-contained,
coherent, bounded entities which are mutual transformations of each
other through simple principles of aggregation and disaggregation.\"33
This imaginary reproduces units that differ from each other, but through
a difference that is one of equivalence. Whether we think of these units
as natural or culturally constructed, they are defined by precise
boundaries in temporal, spatial and cultural terms, they are distinct
but equivalent entities. This model of equivalence by difference was
highly visible at Expo 2010 as at previous world fairs.34 The world fair
appears as a taxonomisation of equivalent national units with their own
pavilion, listing in official guidebooks and dedicated day of cultural
display. [The official Opening Celebration of Expo 2010 saw the parading
of national flags, carried by Chinese youth made up to look as
repetitions and copies of each other.35]{.underline} In this way Expo
2010 recycled the form of Expo 1992 in Seville on which Penelope Harvey
writes: The Expo provided a concrete instance of endless replication, a
cultural artefact built as if to demonstrate the possibilities and
limitations of an entirely 7 consumerist world. Thus there was the
appearance of choice, of multiple perspectives, yet the cultural forms
on show were nevertheless clearly reformulations and repetitions of each
other and of previous events. Sameness and familiarity undermined the
promise of difference.36 What we learn from Baudrillard is that this
second phase ideology moreover \"[functions as a cover for a simulation
of the third order \[or phase\]: Disneyland exists in order to hide that
it is the \'real\' country, all of \'real\' America that is
Disneyland]{.underline}.\"37 The world fair, in this vein, exists in
order to hide that it is the \"[real\" world, all of the \"real\" world
that is the fai]{.underline}r. The presentation of the Expo world as
imaginary and as a dream functions to make us think that the rest is
real. [The world fair takes us further than Disneyland does, as it is
not content with a country, but must simulate the world]{.underline} --
always striving to be more inclusive, with Expo 2010 priding itself on
including pavilions of more countries than ever before, an inclusion
which cost the PRC government large sums in the form of subsidies.38 [In
this way Expo 2010 marks a shift from ideological nation-building to
worlding by simulation. Shanghai, China and the world that surround the
Expo are no longer real, but hyperreal, belonging now to the order of
simulation: \"[It is no longer a question of a false representation of
reality (ideology) but of concealing the fact that the real is no longer
real, and thus of saving the reality principle]{.mark}.]{.underline}\"39
The relation between Baudrillard\'s different phases or orders -- those
that dissimulate something and those that dissimulate that there is
nothing -- comes to the fore in [the hyper-awareness and
self-reflexivity]{.underline} of Expo 2010, as it had begun to do in
previous world fairs.40 There were frequent references to the
self-representations of previous world fairs, in TV programs, books and
in the \"Expo museum\" at Expo 2010.41 In many instances of its
replication, the world fair reflected on itself as the exhibition of the
exhibition of the exhibition without end, as world fair exhibiting world
fair. Key emblems, monuments and mascots of previous fairs were brought
together with the effect of appearing as self-referential signs, as
copies of copies, representations of representations without original,
signifiers of signifiers without signifieds. 42 In this way \"\[t\][he
exhibition represents the world, provides contexts and connections for
an understanding of external realities, but its reflexivity
simultaneously confuses or confounds the distinction of
insider/outsider, representation and reality]{.underline}.\"43 The
implication is one of implosion of the careful construct and of moving
to the fourth phase: \"it has no relation to any reality whatsoever: it
is its own pure simulacrum.\"44 [Therefore, we must take the step beyond
understanding how the exhibition represents the world and grapple with
how the exhibition is the world]{.underline}, and the world the
exhibition. [Reading the Expo through Baudrillard turns the world into
fair and the fair into the world]{.underline}. As I will continue to
show throughout this paper, [[the distinction between one as real or
original and the other as fake or copy can no longer be upheld]{.mark}.
All we have are versions or layers of world/fair, all simulacra. This is
why I argue with this paper that we]{.underline} need to take the step
and study it as such, rather than limit ourselves to **[reading China\'s
mega events purely on the level of representation and ideology,
upholding the reality principle]{.underline}**. [The layers of simulacra
are all world/fair, but cannot be the fair in a fully present way
because Baudrillard]{.underline}, and others with him, have upset the
dichotomization of presence and absence. 45 For this reason, the
relation between 8 the layers of simulacra is not that of a coherent
system, of stable exchange or of dialectics. The world/fair is
simultaneously nowhere and now here. TO BE RECYCLED, OR WHEN IS THE
FAIR? I have asked in the previous section where the fair is and argued
that \"fairness\" is everywhere and anywhere -- [that the world/fair is
simultaneously nowhere and now here. I turn next to the temporality of
simulacra in this formulation to ask when the fair is.]{.underline}
Looking for the world/fair somewhere and sometime beyond the
dichotomization of presence and absence I argue that the fair works
through recycling, revival and reuse, that as a rem(a)inder, it is not
new. What better place to start than with beginnings and origins? \"We
require a visible past, a visible continuum, a visible myth of origin,
which reassures us about our end. Because finally we have never believed
in them.\"46 [Beginnings were certainly important to displays of China
at Expo 2010.]{.underline} [Throughout the Chinese national pavilion and
dozens of Chinese regional pavilions, China is described as the origin
of the world, echoing wider media and academic discourse in
China]{.underline}. Various Chinese regional pavilions tell us that this
is where the first bird flew and the first fire burnt. These pavilions
also pride [China for figuring as the origin of (Chinese)
civilization]{.underline}. I use brackets here because there is some
discrepancy or ambiguity in terms of communicating such messages to
Chinese speaking and English speaking audiences. In the Gansu province
case, for example, which circles around its \"long history\" of more
than 8000 years of civilization, a sign that reads in English \"Dadiwan
Site in Qin\'an County Believed to Start the Chinese Civilization\" in
Chinese language simply reads \"Civilization begins -- Qin\'an Dadiwan\"
(wenming zhaoqi 文明肇启). This kind of slippage between these terms
appears throughout Expo 2010 and make Chinese civilization appear
coterminous with civilization as such. This exhuming of \"[[Chinese
civilization\" functioned as a cover for a simulation of the second
phase, as an ideological tool that served to make the \"5000 years of
uninterrupted Chinese civilization]{.underline}]{.mark}\" appear real.
This uninterrupted history is part of the shift in legitimization of
communist party rule from socialism to nationalism and \"[Chinese
characteristics.\"47 Most importantly, however, [this exhumation took
pride of place because of a dream, \"behind this defunct power that it
tries to annex, of an order that would have had nothing to do with
it]{.mark}]{.underline}, and it dreams of it because it exterminated it
by exhuming it as its own past.\"48 IR scholars are performing this same
exhuming ritual when we dream of the emerging \"[Chinese school\" of IR
theory as a radical alternative to \"the West.\"]{.underline}49 **[The
fascination with this Chinese school resembles that which Baudrillard
describes of Renaissance Christians with American
Indians]{.underline}**. At the beginning of the Christian colonizing
movement existed an instance of bewilderment at \"the very possibility
of escaping the universal law of the Gospel.\"50 In this bewilderment we
could either admit to the lack of universality of the Law, or
exterminate the evidence to the contrary. The conversion or simple
discovery of these different beings is usually enough, for the
Renaissance Christians as for scholars of IR, to slowly exterminate
them. 9 This tactic of discovery and conversion as a form of violent
extermination of others has been acknowledged elsewhere in IR
scholarship51 and it remains a tactic in PRC policy towards its
\"internal others\" in areas like Tibet and Xinjiang.52 Chinese policy
towards its ethnic minorities is presented as proof of the superiority
of Chinese civilization: it produces more ethnics than the ethnics
themselves were able to do -- since the PRC state provides modern
healthcare and \"scientific development\"53 and exempts ethnic
minorities from the one child policy. Moreover the PRC state produces
more ethnic ethnics than they themselves had mustered. [This promotion
of Chinese ethnic minorities through their regional pavilions lies at
the heart of Expo 2010, a base from which the Chinese national pavilion
rises.]{.underline} Everywhere, the ethnic is exotically reproduced,
recycled and rescreened. Everywhere happy, colorful and anachronistic
ethnics sing, dance and rejoice in the greatness of the motherland.54
This overproduction is a means of destruction, a \"promotion\" and
\"rescue\" which forms another step to their symbolic extermination.
Nonetheless, the Expo is highly self-aware in its use of time. It
frequently uses clocks, hourglasses and pendula to mark the countdown to
horror scenarios of planetary destruction in order to drum home its
purported message of \"Better city, Better life.\" In places it moreover
explicitly favors \"recycling\" over \"linearity.\" The theme pavilion
\"City being\" uses similar metaphors to Baudrillard to conceive of
time, that of biological life cycles, metabolism, circulation and
recycling. These are said to be key to the proper functioning of the
system. This pavilion is evocatively constructed as a sewerage system
interspersed with circulating billboard messages of interconnection. It
is explicit about its rejection of linear models, as in a pair of
diagrammatical signs of which the first reads \"A linear model will
result in excessive pollution and waste,\" and the second reads \"A
cyclical model will feature greater recycling and less waste.\" In this
way Expo 2010, like Baudrillard, engages directly with claims to the end
of history: [[History will not come to an end -- since the leftovers,
all the leftovers -- the Church, communism, ethnic groups, conflicts,
ideologies -- are indefinitely recyclable ... History has only wrenched
itself from cyclical time to fall into the order of the
recyclable]{.underline}]{.mark}.55 Through these examples we can see the
world/fair engaged in different phases of simulation, which can be
understood as dissimulating something, but also as dissimulating that
there is nothing. In places, the world/fair appears unreflexive, as
attempting to reinstate the reality of its teleological progress. In
other aspects, however[, its reflexive hyper-aware
recycling]{.underline} seems to show how \"[it has no relation to any
reality whatsoever]{.underline}: it is its [own pure
simulacrum]{.underline}.\"56 Not only, then, can the world no longer be
represented (repriˈzentid) by the fair, but more importantly it can no
longer be fairly re-presented (rē ˈprezəntid), it can no longer be made
present in time and space as some full or complete presence. As such, it
is not enough to remain in our analyses thereof within a simple
framework of representation and ideology**[, but we need to take the
next step and start analyzing China\'s mega events also as
simulacra]{.underline}**. The world/fair is simultaneously nowhere and
now here. The world/fair is recycled. 10 TO BE SCREENED, OR WHO IS THE
FAIR? Having asked in previous sections where and when the fair is I
turn to the question of who is the fair. What happens to subjectivity in
the interactive technologies of the world/fair? I argue that in an order
of recycling, the technologies that make us simultaneously subjects and
objects make the distinction between subject and object untenable with
the effect of making these categories unworkable. It is clear that our
embodiment matters in the world fair as it differentiates between ways
of being in the world/fair along lines of class, race, gender and so on.
At the Shanghai Expo, where well over 90% of visitors were Chinese, the
ability to identify me as a fair-skinned visitor from the outside made
me an immediate part of the exhibited exotica (my being fair made me the
fair, so to speak. And simultaneously the reverse was true, my fairness
positioned me as though outside the fair, observing it/them). But Expo
2010 goes much further in making us part of the fair, through the layers
of interactive technologies by which the fair itself emerges. In the
first instance, we are an active part of this emergence, we can plan,
steer and shape the world/fair, we are the subjects of its emergence.
Visitors are often asked to actively participate in Expo 2010. Indeed,
interactivity is a key feature of many pavilions and different layers of
the world/fair, and one pavilion is expressly dedicated to displaying
it. Here, photographs from Expo 2010 and its preparation, submitted via
the Expo 2010 website, are circulated on screens. Participants can also
send \"blessings and wishes for Expo 2010\" from various websites and
have them screened in the pavilion, surrounded by cards with wishes and
blessings written by its visitors. In a \"wishing tree\" we are
encouraged to write wishes on colorful paper, fold it into airplanes and
throw it into a simulated tree. In parallel, the Online Expo 2010 has
many venues where one\'s avatar can leave wishes, such as the commercial
Vanke pavilion or the Expo dream home. On a multimedia display stand
visitors to Expo 2010 can arrange various building models and
simultaneously a 3D image of its layout will appear on a background
wall, surrounded by previous \"excellent works.\" In this way, a sign
for the multimedia display tells us, \"You could become one of the
designers of a future city.\" In Shanghai\'s own pavilion at Expo 2010
the \"Shanghai forever\" image wall, consisting of revolving triangles
and more than 15000 photographs featuring Shanghai, is a product of
\"mass participation and joint creation\" (gongzhong canyu, gongtong
chuangzuo 公众参与，共同创作) intended to expound the \"design
conception of \'New horizons forever\'\" (or in Chinese \"Shanghai
eternally marches towards new horizon\" Shanghai yongyuan maixiang xin
tiandi 上海永远迈向新天地). Images of images are everywhere and we can
be their creators. **[Nonetheless, in subjecting the world/fair to our
gaze and our actions, we are simultaneously subjected by
it.]{.underline}** [Our bodies are not only in the world/fair, they are
the world fair, simultaneously watching and watched]{.underline},
[displaying and displayed]{.underline}. Often our recognition as
participants rests on our willingness to take on specific subject
positions -- tellingly, the English title of the pavilion for popular
participation is \"Citizens\' initiative pavilion,\" interpellating us
as citizens of the mapped state system on display. It is through such
citizenship that we are allowed recognition in the world/fair. Indeed[,
the different layers of simulacra share citizenship]{.underline} regimes
as a key 11 feature, invoked through the passport. At previous world
fairs, at the Shanghai Expo, and at the online version of Expo 2010 we
can have a passport in which we collect \"visa stamps\" from the
pavilions visited. At points, we have to actively change ourselves to
make us acceptable as subjects in order to have our fair share. Passing
through the world/fair we are screened and tested. This screening echoes
for the subject/object dichotomy (the who) the collapse we saw in
previous sections of the here/there (the where) and the now/then (the
when). As Richard Lane has observed with regards to Baudrillard:
\[T\]here is an interpenetration of the screen metaphor with the notion
of everything being on the surface here, including the \'friendly\'
surveillance which simultaneously shows the people under surveillance on
television screens, which leads to a collapsing of perspectival space
(the removal of the \'gap\' or distance both spatially and temporally
between the viewer and the viewed).57 Here interpenetration is total,
including of architectural and geographical space. The layers of
simulacra cannot be separated. All of Expo 2010, the Shanghai Expo and
its virtual replica, Shanghai, China, all of the world/fair are
indistinguishable "as a total functional screen of activities."58 In
this way all of the world/fair operates through screening, in every
sense of the word. Our participation in the citizenship regimes of the
world/fair is conditional: at Expo 2010 I met a travel guide who was
visiting the world/fair with 60 tourists from Beijing. While her group
went into the Pavilion of future to get \"visa stamps\" in their Expo
passports, she waited ticketless outside, stopped at the border because
she had not paid the fare. Simultaneously, producing a \"real\" passport
meant one could jump pavilion queues to certain pavilions at Expo 2010.
Indeed, the world/fair is most helpful in persuading us that we can (and
should) adjust our selves to pass its screening. In a book dedicated to
Expo etiquette59 prospective visitors to the world/fair are most
helpfully taught how to modify their behavior and their bodies. Chinese
readers can learn amongst other things how to greet, walk, shake hands,
sit, queue and care for their personal hygiene in a polite manner. They
can read about how to go to karaoke, drink coffee with foreigners and
host them in their home according to global decorum. In an appendix we
find a taxonomy of etiquette, outlining customs country by country, from
the US to Egypt.60 One drawn image, for example, shows one man (who we
can assume, from the big nose in profile, represents a Westerner) who
sits nicely at his table with one glass and one plate on which he is
attacking a square (perhaps a piece of toast) with his knife and fork.
He looks with bewilderment and a hint of fear at another man or boy who
smiles a big smile as he carries his second plate to the table, where he
has already assembled two glasses various fruits and one more plate
overflowing with food (in the mish-mash of which we can identify various
fruits, a whole fish, a crab and some shrimp). The picture\'s caption
instructs its Chinese readers the civilized manner of partaking of the
fare of the fair through a rhyming slogan: \"Big eyes, small stomach,
cannot finish the delicious fare\" (yan da duzi xiao, meiwei chi bu liao
眼大肚子小， 美味吃不了).61 The concluding chapter of the book, on \"how
to be a refined and well mannered Expo person,\" clearly conceives of
such politeness in terms of the return to an original 12 state. We are
encouraged to \"utilize the Shanghai Expo as a historical turning point,
to make every one of us change into politely speaking Expo people\" and
after being told about \"the Expo\'s demand on the etiquette of the
people of the host country\" to \"through the Expo make elegant
etiquette return to China.\"62 Thus, being a civilized citizen of the
world/fair is not about being more like somebody else, but about being
more like your self; it is a question of recycling. At other points,
moving through the world/fair our bodies are more explicitly hijacked by
screening, made to do things potentially against our will (and indeed
through or in advance thereof), proliferated, taken apart. The Ningxia
Hui Autonomous Region case for example shows visitors\' images captured
and repeatedly displayed on screens. As citizens of the world/fair our
bodies are captured and displayed as copy upon copy throughout Expo
2010, media and academic work, including this article. This hijacking
technology is not simply in the hands of states. The corporate pavilion
of Siemens powerfully commoditized Chinese cultural heritage and the
Chinese national modernization project. Its display was marketed to
Chinese audiences under the name Tianxia yi jia (天下一家), meaning
\"All-under-heaven\" is like a family, or the world is one. To English
language audiences the same pavilion was marketed through the name We
are the world, a name which aptly brings out the recycling nature of the
fair through reviving Michael Jackson\'s old hit song, but which also
showcases the ambiguity of the question \"who is the world/fair.\" The
\"we\" is ambiguous and inside the pavilion the capacity in which \"we\"
become the world/fair is telling. At the pavilion entrance we are
photographed and at the end of the guided tour, when we come full
circle, we are shown a film that recycles our image. Having measured and
analyzed our facial features, our faces pass through a computer program
and appear as avatars, transformed, singing along with the Expo 2010
theme tune. A sign at the pavilion reads: After scanning and capturing
the user's facial features, the image will be recorded and transformed
into an avatar allowing users to feel as if they are starring in a
pre-programmed movie or video ... How will this technology better our
lives? Provides an entertaining experience for people to play a role in
a movie or become a \'star\'. Everyone has the chance to stand in the
spotlight. Our avatars in the virtual version of Expo 2010 are, to some
extent at least, a consequence of our volition and choice, albeit
screened and monitored with a mandatory Chinese ID number registration.
In Siemens\'s corporate version of \"Allunder-heave\"\' we are the
world/fair without being told in what our stardom will consist. Our
avatars are exposed as pre-programmed, as playing a pre-scribed role,
and this play has only one script, one where we all sing along with the
Chinese tune. From these examples we can see two kinds of technologies
operating in the world/fair: ones that represent the world and ones that
operate through simulation, \"provoking a reflexive awareness of
artificiality and simulacra\": The first of these conceives of
technology as enabler, and is the concept that lies behind the notion of
the Expo as a technology of nationhood. Technology enables a perspective
that can produce wholeness from fragmentation. Expo 13 enables the
appearance of the world as a whole, through the revelation of the
fragments that are cut from it and the apparent celebration of their
differences.63 Expo 2010\'s use of interactive technologies moved away
from \"representations\" of the world as we know it to be. It celebrated
instead the possibility of producing a simulated world, copies of copies
(dis)interested in an original: \[A\] world of images more real than the
real, a fascination with the hyper-real, pretensions to realities that
were never there in the first place or at least not in such perfect
form, concrete manifestations of abstract possibilities \[that\] produce
the essence of life itself as outcome not origin.64 The examples
discussed here reaffirm a rather sinister side to simulation: \"We are
living through a movement from an organic, industrial society to a
polymorphous, information system -- from all work to all play, a deadly
game.\"65 Through these technologies of the world/fair, not only our
concepts of spatiality and temporality, but also our notions of subject
and object, are displaced. Being in a simulacral world/fair is
simulacral being. As such, we need to move beyond analyses of Chinese
\"mega events\" through concepts of simple representation and reality,
and work to understand how they operate through simulation and
simulacra. We are copies of copies without original, simulacral avatars
in virtual hyper-reality. The Expo is us: our bodies, our dreams, our
future. TO BE TACTICAL, OR HOW TO BE FAIR? This paper has asked what it
means to be fair. I have argued that the fair is not a fake copy of a
\"real\" world, but that as simulation it marks the breakdown of the
distinctions of the copy from the original, of the fair from the world.
The world/fair is everything and nothing, simultaneously nowhere and now
here. I have shown that the world/fair works through recycling, revival
and reuse that, as a rem(a)inder, is not new. I have further argued that
being in the world fair turns us all into simulacral avatars without
original, circulated in virtual hyper-reality. **[All these claims have
serious consequences for the study of China in the world.]{.underline}**
My reading here shows **[the problem of thinking of China as the \"other
country.\"]{.underline}**66 Baudrillardian simulacra have come to
symbolize postmodernity, continental philosophy, late capitalism and an
American way of life. All of these terms imply a where, when and who. A
key finding of this paper is that the implied answers to those questions
are not as straightforward as may at first glance appear. Reading Expo
2010 as **[simulacra shows that [we cannot locate \"China\" as an other,
in another place and another time, than that of our purported late
capitalism or postmodern condition]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Importantly,
though, through Baudrillard\'s simulacra we can see how this is not a
case of \"catching up,\" of those behind (finally) becoming like us. The
point is not that \"the others\" have now become \"the same,\" so that
we can happily apply our \"Western theories\" and ignore difference. The
point is, rather, that reading the world/fair as simulation messes with
its notions of inside and outside, now and then, subject and object to
the point were these terms are no longer workable. What we end up with
is not the many turning into the one, with the convergence of others
into the self. Instead, what remains is a fragmented plethora of truth,
not the unreal 14 but the hyper-real. The effect is our own
disappearance. The object becomes us, sees us. We see ourselves through
the Expo. The Expo is us. My reading here of Expo 2010 as simulacra has
examined some of the distinctions implied in the where, when and who of
the world/fair, and shows that we may be better off not taking our
distinctions so seriously. But of course the study of the world/fair is
serious. We all want to base our work on fair ground, but what happens
to fair descriptions when that ground has turned out to be a fairground?
In the simulacral world/fair, can we still retain strategy? Already in
his earlier work, Baudrillard had come to the conclusion that in a
\"hyperrealist\" system, \"\[s\]trictly speaking, nothing remains for us
to base anything on.\"67 In a hyperreal world of simulacra, the weight
of information makes modernity (and its space) fall apart. This has
shattering implications for meaning: \"where we think that information
produces meaning, the opposite occurs.\"68 Meaning, truth and the real
are reversed, that is, they are divested of any universal meaning, which
restricts them to local, partial objects.69 In this age of simulation we
have surpassed old versions of uncertainty and made our problem
permanent.70 Recycling and simulation, with what they do to reality, to
time and space, demand something from us: we no longer have the choice
of advancing, of preserving in the present destruction, or of retreating
-- but only of facing up to this radical illusion.71 In this manner, the
uncertainty of the simulated world/fair is not necessarily a cause for
pessimism. Coulter has claimed \"Baudrillard has long found a radically
uncertain and ultimately unknowable world a far more comfortable place
to live than one which is predictable. Baudrillard lives, as well as do
\[sic\], in a world in a permanent state of reversibility, and he
prefers it to a world that is accomplished.\"72 I agree with Coulters
sentiment, but think we are better off thinking of Baudrillard\'s (and
our) being in this recycled world as profoundly uncomfortable. The
question posed is most pertinent to the way we think about the world and
our role in worlding: Does the world have to have meaning, then? That is
the real problem. If we could accept this meaninglessness of the world,
then we could play with forms, appearances and our impulses, without
worrying about their ultimate destination \... Do we absolutely have to
choose between meaning and non-meaning? But the point is precisely that
we do not want to. The absence of meaning is no doubt intolerable, but
it would be just as intolerable to see the world assume a definitive
meaning.73 This implosion or disappearance of meaning, truth and the
real, however, does not mean we cannot have strategy: \"Theoretical
violence, not truth, is the only resource we have left us.\"74 The
strategy Baudrillard has developed is a \"fatal strategy,\" one that
values uncertainty and where, in contrast to banal theory, the subject
is no longer under any illusion of being more cunning than the object.75
[In contrast to the teleological narratives on China in the world -- in
common approaches of IR theory, in the PRC government\'s rendition of
China\'s inevitable rise to world leadership, and in the
conceptualizations of time and space at Expo 2010]{.underline} -- the
world described by Baudrillard is not determined. In this world
\"[everything is antagonistic\" rather than harmonious and good will not
necessarily triumph over evil]{.underline}.76 15 The strategy, then, is
not for theory like in Enlightenment thought to reflect the real, but
instead to work as a challenge. The world/fair is not compatible with
the \"real\" that is imposed upon it. Importantly though: \"the function
of theory is certainly not to reconcile it, but on the contrary, to
seduce, to wrest things from their condition, to force them into an
over-existence which is incompatible with that of the real.\"77 The
purpose then of theory is to s(t)imulate the (im)possible in the
world/fair. My hope with this article is to take one small step in such
a direction and provoke us into thinking of **[China\'s \"mega events\"
beyond representation, reality and ideology -- to think of them in terms
of simulacra]{.underline}**

### Cybersecurity

#### Cybersecurity materializes the boundary conflicts of peoples, territories, and orders-of-meaning [into constitutive threats that are then installed at the center of security concerns]{.underline} 

**Kaiser, 15** (Robert, Professor of Geography @ Univ.
Wisconsin-Madison, PhD (Geography) from Columbia University, recipient
of a Visiting Fellowship on Estonia and the Birth of Cyberwar @
Aleksanteri Institute via the University of Helsinki; \"The Birth of
Cyberwar,\" *Political Geography*. 46 (2015) 11-20.)

[It is not as if cyberwar had not been conceived of prior to
2007]{.underline}. It [was imaginatively produced in]{.underline}
[[**science fiction** novels and film]{.mark}s]{.underline}, [from
Shockwave Rider in 1975 (Lesk 2007: 77), to War Games (1983) and
Terminator (1984), capping the period off with the 2007 blockbuster Live
Free or Die Hard, which was playing in theaters in Tallinn during the
summer of the cyberattacks.]{.underline} [The 2007 film is particularly
important here, since it featured a disgruntled former cybersecurity
military analyst who used a broad-based cyberassault to take down the
critical infrastructure (CI) of the United States]{.underline}. [In
Tallinn, the movie **[fed into the affective intensity
surrounding]{.mark} the riots and [cyberattacks, firing the imagination
of policymakers and publics]{.mark} alike**.]{.underline} [**[Cyberwar
was]{.mark}** also being [**discursively produced** in political and
military **think tanks**]{.mark} beginning in the early
1990s]{.underline}. One of the first examples of this is the 1993
publication "[Cyberwar is coming!]{.underline}" which recently
celebrated its 20th anniversary ([Arquilla, 2013, Arquilla and Ronfeldt,
1993]{.underline}). This work too [sought to fire the imagination
of]{.underline} its [readers, **spinning out [anticipatory cyberwar
scenarios]{.mark}** and advocating a cyberwar **doctrine** to military
and political analysts and other cyberwar "managers of
unease]{.underline}" (Bigo 2002). Published [at]{.underline} about [the
same time]{.underline}, and [foreshadowing the proliferation of drone
strikes]{.underline} in what Gregory, 2011, Gregory, 2014 has called
"the everywhere war," "[Welcome to hyperwar" [paint]{.mark}ed [a more
dystopian vision of smart weaponry and war machinery taking over the
battlespaces of the future]{.mark}]{.underline} (Arnett 1992). Later in
the 1990s, [due in part to concerns surrounding Y2K and also to the
rising number of denial of service (DoS) cyberattacks, increasing US
governmental attention was devoted to computer security and the threat
posed by cyberwarfare]{.underline}. In 1998, the Clinton White House
issued Presidential Decision Directive 63 to assess the vulnerabilities
of CI to cyberattack, and followed this up with the National Plan for
Information Systems Protection [in 2000. Titled Defending America\'s
Cyberspace, this document presented cyberspace as a vulnerable dimension
of the sovereign territory needing protection, largely due to the
failure to build in adequate defenses when cyberspace first
emerged.]{.underline} The authors of this document -- including
President Clinton and Richard Clarke, then National Coordinator for
Security, Infrastructure Protection and Counter-Terrorism -- [billed it
as "the first attempt by any national government to design a way to
protect its cyberspace" (White House, 2000, iv), and also sought to fire
the imaginations of their readership, conjuring up a whole host of
cyber-villains meaning to do America harm.]{.underline} We are at risk.
The United States depends more on computers today then ever before ...
We have created a gaping vulnerability in our national security and
economic stability ... We are vulnerable to mischief-making hackers,
hardware and software failures, cyber criminals and, most alarmingly, to
deliberate attack from nation states and terrorists (White House, 2000,
1). These efforts were paralleled by Congressional hearings on the
threat of cyberwar and America\'s preparedness -- or lack thereof -- to
counter it (e.g., US House of Representatives, 2000[). [The increasing
academic, political and popular attention paid to cyberwar was matched
by a growing number of high profile cyberattacks]{.underline}]{.mark}.
In 1998, [Tamil 'hacktivists' organized an email inundation campaign of
Sri Lankan embassies]{.underline}. In 1999, [Chinese hackers responded
to the US bombardment of China\'s Embassy in Belgrade by attacking the
American Embassy\'s webpage in Beijing]{.underline}. [In 2000, Israeli
and Palestinian hackers attacked the websites of Hezbollah and Israel\'s
Foreign Ministry respectively, and American and Chinese hackers
exchanged broad-based attacks against Chinese and US websites following
the downing of an American spy plane over Chinese territorial waters in
2001]{.underline} (Denning, 2001, Lesk, 2007). On the cusp of the new
millennium, **[[a rapid escalation and intensification of discursive
practices were working to materialize cyberwar as a new policy
object]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The events of [September 11]{.underline},
2001 [changed all that, as the]{.underline} "global [war on
terror]{.underline}" (GWOT) [remade the security landscape]{.underline}.
[Initiatives begun to prepare for cyberwarfare were shelved, meetings
were canceled, and "critical infrastructure protection" shifted from
cyberspace to more conventional spaces of security]{.underline}.
Although some policy documents and studies continued to be produced
(e.g., Billo and Chang, 2004, Clarke and Knake, 2010, 120),
[cyberspace]{.underline} and cybersecurity themselves [were re-imagined
and re-purposed to combat global terrorist networks]{.underline}, and
were folded into and made an integral part of the Patriot Act of 2001
and the Department of Homeland Security in 2002. [If cyberwar\'s
performative materialization had been preempted by the GWOT in the
United States, in Europe it had not yet been taken up]{.underline}.
Although the Council of Europe had passed a Convention on Cybercrime in
2001, **[cyberwar itself was not considered]{.underline}**. And [**at
NATO\'s 2002 Prague Summit**, which went to great lengths in discussing
the ways NATO needed to transform and adapt in the wake of 9/11,
cybersecurity was barely mentioned]{.underline} (NATO, 2002). **[[The
birth of cyberwar would have to await both the declining importance of
terror as a policy object and a catalyzing event]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
The birth of cyberwar On 26 April 2007, [workers under orders from the
Estonian government began the process of removing a bronze soldier
statue and the bodies of Red Army soldiers from a public park in
Tallinn]{.underline}. [The monument, built to commemorate the Red
Army\'s liberation of Tallinn during WWII, had become the site of
intensifying contestation between self-identifying Russians and others
who felt **disenfranchised** in independent Estonia, and **Estonian**
**nationalists** who viewed the USSR, Russia, and Russians as unwanted
occupiers of their national homeland]{.underline} (Bruggemann and
Kasekamp, 2008, Kaiser, 2012, Lehti et al., 2008, LICHR., 2007, Paabo,
2008). [Throughout April 26th, a crowd of protesters gathered, growing
larger and angrier by nightfall. Rioting erupted at the site and spread
to Old Town, continuing off and on for two days, in an event named the
Bronze Night]{.underline}. Beginning on April 27 and lasting until
mid-May[, a series of cyberattacks were launched against governmental,
media, banking and political party websites, in a politically motivated
effort to participate in the Bronze Night and extend it into cyberspace.
Estonia\'s political and military elite, as well as news media, **blamed
Russia** and a disloyal fifth column of Russians living in Estonia for
both the riots and the cyberattacks, "remediating]{.underline}" (Grusin
2004) [the latter as a cyberwar launched by Russia against Estonia. A
cyberwar resonance machine quickly developed throughout western security
assemblages, and by the end of May 2007 the cyberattacks were being
widely hailed as the world\'s first cyberwar]{.underline} (BBC, 2007,
Kirk, 2007, Landler and Markoff, 2007, Mite, 2007, Tanner, 2007,
Traynor, 2007). First, it is important to acknowledge that if [this
event had happened immediately after 9/11, its affective capacity would
almost certainly not have been sufficient to actualize
cyberwar.]{.underline} [Coming at a time when public and political
support for the GWOT had significantly waned provided the event with the
temporal distance needed for cyberwar managers of unease to capture the
imagination of western policymakers and publics.]{.underline} However,
not just any cyberattack would do. Both **[the sociospatial context of
the event]{.underline}**, and also how it was managed, [**were critical
for the production of resonance.** [The success of Estonia\'s
cyberwarriors "in providing a compelling narrative for their
analysis]{.mark}]{.underline}" (Salter, 2008, 237) [[may be attributed
to their **performative enactment of a familiar** and believable **set
of Cold War** place-**identities** featuring Russia and **Russian-ness
as enemy Other of Estonia, Europe and the US**]{.underline}, a]{.mark}nd
Estonia and Estonian-ness as small, vulnerable victim. **[[Western
imaginations, primed for such a threat scenario, were easily
captured]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Blank, 2008, Davis, 2007, Robert, 2012,
Ruus, 2008, Weiss, 2007). Waking the World Up to Cyberwar World
governments are trying to figure out how to defend themselves against
cyber-warfare, and Estonia leads the way (Public Radio International,
2010). That cyberspace "makes us vulnerable" is a central characteristic
of cybersecurity discourse, and the more technologically advanced, the
more vulnerable one is imagined to be (Bernard-Wills and Ashenden 2012,
118). [Since independence Estonia had become one of the most wired
countries in the world, and in this regard at least is imagined to
occupy a future timespace toward which the rest of the world is
headed]{.underline}. This, [coupled with Estonia\'s small size and
location on the border of Europe\'s 'Other', was prominently featured in
explanations of why the cyberattacks had occurred]{.underline}. [This
"architecture of enmity]{.underline}" (Amoore, 2009) [**displaced** the
internal place-identity conflicts between Russian-ness and Estonian-ness
that produced the Bronze Night, even as it remediated the cyberattacks
into the world\'s first cyberwar]{.underline}. Estonia as a small,
modern, technology-savvy country was an ideal test-ground for
cyberattackers with political motivations ... Estonia happened to
experience the first large-scale attacks, but ... vulnerabilities are
growing in both the developed and developing world (Tiirmaa-Klaar,
2011a, 1--2). **[The 2007 cyberattacks were universally described in
media, in official documents and by cybersecurity specialists as a
"wakeup call."]{.underline}** The first question confronting
policymakers charged with defending against the cyberattacks was whether
or not to issue the call, to go public. Given the widespread use of the
sites that were targeted, the cyberattacks would have been difficult to
deny. [A debate within government circles occurred, and the decision to
go public owed as much to international as to domestic
considerations]{.underline}. This event seemed to be just what western
cyberwar managers of unease were waiting for: Here we had this example
of cyberattacks actually being part of a political campaign, affecting
the whole of society ... In the United States lots of agencies and lots
of people recognized the problem (of cyberwar) but were not successful
in communicating it. Or were unable because of classification reasons to
communicate it. And now we have Estonia who is willing to communicate it
and to use their country as an example of what may happen. And I think
[Estonia and the United States]{.underline} [together]{.underline} [sort
of ... I mean, the level of conferences I participated in after 2007 was
just insane. We were in the Air Force national conference with thousands
of very high-ranking officers, we were briefing Congress, we were
briefing the White House, at the very highest level]{.underline}
(Interview, [former Estonian Defense Ministry official]{.underline},
Tallinn, October 2012). [President Ilves took the lead in issuing the
wakeup call, and in remediating the cyberattacks as a cyberwar launched
by Russia -- imagined as the constitutive outside of the civilized
spaces of Estonia and Europe]{.underline}: ["Finally, I turn to Russia,
Estonia\'s neighbour, with a clear message -- **try to remain
civilized!** It is not customary in Europe to use computers belonging to
public institutions for cyber-attacks against another country\'s public
institutions" (Ilves, 2007a]{.underline}). [Describing the Bronze Night
as "the greatest challenge to the security" of Estonia since
independence and the cyberattacks as "cyber-war" (Ilves, 2007b), Ilves
proclaimed that "Estonia was attacked with a weapon and in a manner
whose full significance is just beginning to dawn on the whole world in
the 21st century"]{.underline} (Ilves, 2007c). Former **[Defense
Minister Aaviksoo raised the issue of invoking Article 5]{.underline}**
(common defense) **[with NATO while the event was still
underway]{.underline}** (Traynor, 2007), and asserted that "[what took
place was according to our interpretation cyber warfare and cyber
terrorism. In essence, cyberattacks against Estonia demonstrated that
the Internet already is a perfect battlefield of the 21st
century]{.underline}" (Aaviksoo 2007a). **[Although]{.underline}**
"**[NATO\'s political leaders judged that the cyberattacks were not an
act of war, NATO\'s Department of Public Diplomacy later created a short
film about the episode entitled War in Cyberspace]{.underline}**"
(Singer and Friedman 2014, 122), **[allowing Estonia\'s cyberwarriors a
NATO-sanctioned platform from which to present their 'compelling
narrative'.]{.underline}** Following Derrida, Burke (2002, 4--5) defines
an [aporia as "an untotalizable problem at the heart of the concept,
disrupting its trajectory, emptying out its fullness, opening out its
closure]{.underline}." He identifies two interlocking aporias of
security: first, [that [claims to universal security for all humans
**are challenged by a foundational "aporetic distance between our
'humanity' and a secure identity bounded and defined by the
state**]{.mark}]{.underline};" and second, that [[securing oneself "must
be purchased at the expense of another]{.underline}"]{.mark} (Burke,
2002, 6). [**[These aporias are central to the performative enactment of
our sociospatial selves]{.underline}**,]{.mark} [which are bordered
against a constitutive outside that is both totally excluded and at the
same time occupies the very center of our place-identities]{.underline}
(Butler, 1993, Kaiser, 2014, Kaiser and Nikiforova, 2008). **[The 2007
[events that materialized cyberwar as a new policy object were created
by these aporias of security]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, **[and at the same
time embedded them at the very heart of
cybersecurity]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[.]{.underline}** [The Bronze
Night and the accompanying cyberattacks were a '**war event'** that
ruptured the surface calm in Estonian society, exposing the ways in
which Russia and Russian-ness performatively materialize as the
constitutive outside of Estonia and Estonian-ness through a wide range
of everyday discursive practices, and without which Estonia and
Estonian-ness could not exist in their present for]{.underline}m
(Feldman, 2001, Kaiser, 2014, Kaiser and Nikiforova, 2008). Through
these performative enactments, Estonia\'s and Estonians\' security are
purchased at the expense of Russia and Russians (Feldman, 2001, Kuus,
2004). [Both the Bronze Night and the cyberattacks were remediated as
acts of war, attacks on Estonia\'s sovereignty by Russia and a disloyal
fifth column of **Russian enemy Others within**]{.underline} (Kaiser
2012). **[Cyberwar\'s materialization through this event carried this
aporia of security into cyberspace, and helped to reconstitute a
familiar geopolitical imaginary from the Cold War in cyberspace, now
conceived as a battlespace where states -- aligned into camps of western
defenders and eastern attackers -- wage cyberwar]{.underline}**. "Of
course, you know, when you look on the map, then it\'s very clear.
Estonia\'s a small nation but we have to be concerned about our
neighbors. **[Thank God we are now members of NATO and the EU, and we
are not alone anymore. And in cyberwar we are not alone too" (Interview,
Cyber Defense League, Tallinn, May 2011]{.underline}**). Within this
battlespace, [Estonia is imagined as occupying a vulnerable border
between East and West, where cyberwar is an ever-present
threat]{.underline}. This danger is also seen as an opportunity: "[We
are still living between the East and the West -- we are a playground
for bad guys ... We are looking to increase cooperation with the US. Why
should the US cooperate with us? Because we are on the border. If
something happens, we can give you a warning that something is coming"
(Interview, Cyber Defense League, Tallinn, September 2012]{.underline}).
Bigo argues that **[[those acknowledged as security experts "transfer
the legitimacy they gain from struggles]{.mark}]{.underline}** against
terrorists, criminals, spies, and counterfeiters [[toward other targets,
most notably transnational political activists,]{.underline}]{.mark}
people crossing borders, or people born in the country but with foreign
parents" (Bigo 2002, 63). However, [**[given]{.underline}** t]{.mark}he
aporias of security, and [[**the reiterative citationality of security
practices**,]{.mark} it seems more accurate to assert that the
[**managers of unease** derive their status **as** **security experts**
from **the boundary effects that performatively materialize such
threatening Others**]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [who in turn become embedded
at the very core of the security discourse that such specialists claim
expertise over.]{.underline} **[Securitization is thus a border
performative, continually producing insecurity within the population and
territory that must then be secured]{.underline}**. [Insecurity can
never be banished and security finally procured, since insecurity
occupies the very heart of securitization practices, with security
itself always occupying the promised timespace of the
future]{.underline}]{.mark} (Anderson, 2010a). **[The
cyberattacks]{.underline}**, re-imagined as a cyberwar launched against
a small, technologically advanced state by a large and aggressive
neighbor, **[displaced the problematic relationship between Estonian
nationalists in power and self-identifying Russians who felt victimized
in independent Estonia]{.underline}** [that produced the Bronze Night\'s
actualization and the cyberattacks themselves. **The remediation of the
cyberattacks as Russia engaging in cyberwar**]{.underline} against
Estonia and the West also transposed a familiar geopolitical b/ordering
onto cyberspace: Estonia/Estonian-ness -- good guys, small but capable
cyberdefenders of 'the West' vs. Russia/Russian-ness -- bad guys,
perpetrators of cyberwar, 'the East'. At the same time, the event
**[provided]{.underline}** Estonian **[security professionals an
important opportunity to reiterate to European and American audiences
that Russia remains an ever-present threat, securing for themselves the
role of "transactors]{.underline}**" (Kuus, 2004) **[of
cybersecurity]{.underline}**.

### Cyberwar Link

#### Computational propaganda mystifies occupations and conflicts to make any coherent theory of warfare or alliances impossible. In the sea of misattribution, there is always another opinion, and [the inescapably provisional and easily falsified nature of all accounts of cyberwar energizes the death of meaning itself]{.underline}. In the face of the opacity of cyberconflict, [desire tends toward militarized paranoia]{.underline}, accepting the experts of Empire just as easily as fake news. The impact is a global civil war operating at every level that far surpasses any Russian threat.

\*modified for ableist language

[Within cyberwar apparatuses]{.underline}, [humans]{.underline}, for the
moment, remain a necessary link or relay enlisted in multiple ways,
voluntary and involuntary. Yet while humans [remain in the
loop]{.underline}, or on the loop (that is to say, with a veto on
otherwise automatic processes), [it is within a war-fighting system that
increasingly decenters subjectivity as a "peripheral]{.underline}"
(Gibson 2015)[.]{.underline} Because of this, [the human subject of
cyberwar is dazed and confused]{.underline}. This is in part [a
consequence of the]{.underline} intentional **[secrecy of
cyberwar]{.underline}**, but the possibilities of such stealth[, and its
intensification by contingency and accident]{.underline}, arise from the
speed, scope, and complexity of the technology of cyberwar apparatuses.
Deeply [implicated]{.underline} as [users]{.underline} are [in the
militarization of networks]{.underline}, their [involvement is
frequently unknowing]{.underline} or misrecognized. [We are indeed
"empowered" by technology---but not necessarily in the way we are told.
Rather than acting as globally aware networked individuals, intervening
purposefully in great political events with a few deft touches to an
iPhone, our cyberwar involvement is as likely to be a misapprehending,
deceived, or involuntary conduit for war whose outbreak has either
passed by unnoticed or was only imagined]{.underline} (at least until
this imagined onset provoked real counteraction), [or whose combatants
are drastically misidentified.]{.underline} [In conflicts where a
crucial action may be the opening of virally contaminated email, the
retweeting of a message from a software agent mistaken for a human, or
the invisible contribution of a hijacked computer (or digitalized
refrigerator) to a massive botnet, we are in the realm of Marx's "they
do it, but they do not know it]{.underline}." "[Even if you do not see
the war, the war sees you" is the logic of the]{.underline} ~~blind~~
\[[unknowing\] gaze of]{.underline} [cyberwar]{.underline}, **[a regime
in which although "the subject does not see where \[this regime\] is
leading, he follows]{.underline}**" (Lacan 1998, 75). [The obscurity
inherent to cyberwar afflicts even those most expert in its
prosecution.]{.underline} [During the U.S. occupation of
Iraq]{.underline}, [the **CIA** and Saudi Arabia's
intelligence]{.underline} [service]{.underline} [set up a "fake" jihadi
website]{.underline} [to monitor Islamic extremist
activity]{.underline}. In 2008, [the]{.underline} U.S. Army and the
**[NSA]{.underline}** **[concluded that the "fake" site
was]{.underline}** **[actually serving as an operational planning hub
for attacks by Saudi Arabian jihadists]{.underline}** joining the Sunni
insurgency. [When they proposed the site be destroyed, the CIA objected,
but Pentagon hackers proceeded with the "take-down]{.underline}."
**[They inadvertently disrupted more than three hundred servers in Saudi
Arabia, Germany, and Texas.]{.underline}** As a task force participant
ruefully explained, "to take down a Web site that is up in Country X,
because [the cyber-world knows no boundaries,]{.underline} you may end
up taking out a server that is located in Country Y." [The Saudi Arabian
intelligence service, which regarded the "fake" site as a "boon," was
furious; mollification required "a lot of bowing and
scraping."]{.underline} **[The CIA]{.underline}**, too, **[was
resentful;]{.underline}** **[the agency "understood]{.underline}** that
intelligence would be lost, and it was; that relationships with
cooperating intelligence services would be damaged, and they were; and
that **[the terrorists would migrate to other sites, and they
did]{.underline}**" (Nakashima 2010[). A more serious
example]{.underline} of unintended consequences [is Stuxnet, the
computer worm planted in the computers at the uranium enrichment plant
outside Natanz to prevent Iran from building a nuclear bomb, an
operation now widely attributed to a joint U.S.--Israeli intelligence
operation. As]{.underline} we noted in chapter 1, the worm's impeccable
simulation of a mechanical failure apparently unrelated to software
performance is considered a watershed in the development of
cyberweaponry. What it is not so generally recognized, however, is that
it [went out of control]{.underline}. [Stuxnet's discovery by the
security company VirusBlokAda in mid-June 2010 was the result of the
virus accidentally spreading beyond its intended target due to a
programming error introduced in an update. This allowed the worm to
enter into an engineer's computer connected to the centrifuges and
thence travel to the internet. It then propagated to industrial sites
far from Natanz, not only in Iran but in Indonesia and India, and
beyond, reportedly infecting the systems of oil giant Chevron and a
Russian nuclear plant.]{.underline} As one cybersecurity expert puts it,
"[By allowing Stuxnet to spread globally, its authors committed
collateral damage worldwide]{.underline}" (Schneier 2010). Although in
many of these cases, the virus did not activate, because of differences
between the Natanz system it targeted and the others it accidentally
infected, another consequence was that [the Stuxnet code became widely
available for use or adaptation by hackers other than those who
developed it]{.underline}. [Such]{.underline} [probably inadvertent
propagation can be considered what Paul Virilio (2000) terms **an
"integral accident**," a malfunction intrinsic to, and **inevitable**
**for, viral cyberweapons**]{.underline}.15 [Once one passes to the
civilian perception of real or imagined cyberwar effects, the scope for
misrecognition increases and potentially ranges **from imagining wars
where none exists to not noticing those that are actually
raging**]{.underline}. Zetter (2016b) reports [**a "misrecognized"
attack on a power grid in Ukraine** that occurred on December 23, 2015,
when twenty-seven substations of the Prykarpattya Oblenergo, a Ukrainian
power distributor that serves 538,000 customers, went dead after the
company's computers were infected by a version of a high-powered
web-based malware BlackEnergy 3, in what is generally regarded as an act
of Russian aggression, although the attribution, **as always, is
inconclusive**]{.underline}. [The cyberevent attracted the attention of
cybersecurity and hacking communities]{.underline}: the blogosphere and
specialized online channels and platforms competed for the most informed
interpretation of the blackout. **[In Ukraine, however, where the
cyberattack took place, it was unnoticed,]{.underline}** [despite
successfully plunging hundreds of cities and villages into
darkness.]{.underline} With the exception of security, administration,
and technical personnel of the power station, [the local population took
the blackout for a common power shutdown, a nationally centralized
procedure aimed at saving electricity in the country's declining and
war-afflicted economy]{.underline}. In a reverse example, [in August
2008]{.underline}, [cyberattacks took place in the midst of a broader
**armed conflict** between Russia and Georgia]{.underline} [over the
disputed territory of South Ossetia]{.underline}. [Although these
attacks, allegedly coordinated or encouraged by the Russian state, did
not significantly affect the ongoing kinetic action, distribution of
malicious software; defacement of political, governmental, and financial
websites; and multiple DoS and DDoS attacks on governmental, financial,
news, and media websites generated confusion and panic among the
population of the country at a time when "Georgia was the most dependent
on the availability of information channels]{.underline}" (Tikk, Kaska,
and Vihul 2010, 69--79, 72). Then, on March 28, 2011, the internet in
Georgia and Armenia went down for nearly the entire day after a
seventy-five- year- old Georgian woman named Hayastan Shakarian, while
digging for scrap copper, accidentally cut a fiber-optic cable owned by
Georgian Railway Telecom that runs through the two countries (Millar
2011). [It would not have been too strange if, to a traumatized wartime
population, this accident had signaled another kinetic
offensive]{.underline} (Deibert 2013, 29). [How many times would such
suspicions need to be shared and commented on in social networks to
become someone's "knowledge"? To scale and speed up to the status of
"fake news"?]{.underline} To serve as a useful context or leverage for a
future cyberattack? To premediate an invasion? **[The cybernetic
autopoiesis of unplanned and undesired incidents, unavoidable and
unpreventable accidents, as well as the masterminded and preplanned
operations constitute the ongoing production of events and semblances
constitutive of cyberwar dynamics]{.underline}**. [Everything, even what
did not have place, did not happen, or was misattributed, has a positive
value in the cyberwar economy.]{.underline} **[This trompe l'oeil
creates ~~blind~~ spots in the field of vision of all observers of
cyberwar.]{.underline}**16 It **[accelerates]{.underline}** what Žižek
(1999, 322) calls **[the "decline of symbolic efficiency" in digital
capitalism.]{.underline}** As Jodi Dean (2014, 213) explains, this
develops the Lacanian idea that [there is no longer a **Master-Signifier
that stabilizes meaning**,]{.underline} th[at knits together the chain
of signifiers and hinders their tendencies to float off into
indeterminacy]{.underline}. While **[the absence]{.underline}** of such
a [master might seem to produce a situation of complete openness and
freedom---no authority is telling the subject what to do, what to
desire, how to structure its choices]{.underline}---Žižek argues that in
fact [the result is unbearable, suffocating closure]{.underline}. [A
"setting of electronically mediated subjectivity]{.underline} \[that\]
[is one of]{.underline} infinite doubt and [ultimate reflexifisation"
intensifies "the fundamental uncertainty accompanying the impossibility
of totalization" in a symbolic environment where "**there is always
another option, link, opinion**, **nuance** or contingency that we
haven't taken into account"]{.underline} (Dean 2014, 212).
**[Computational propaganda that aims to mystify invasions and
occupations, or promote cynical disaffection from an adversary's
political system, actively weaponizes the "decline in symbolic
efficiency," but it is endemic to the whole field of
cyberwar.]{.underline}** [The extreme uncertainty and opacity of
cyberwar do not]{.underline}, however, [inhibit the interpellative
effects of contending cyberwar apparatuses as they summon up
cybersoldiers, patriotic hackers, vigilante militias, and
security-conscious digital citizens. On the]{.underline} [contrary, the
problems of **verifying or disproving**]{.underline} multiple alarms and
accusations **[accelerates these processes and puts them into
overdrive]{.underline}**. To put this point in psychoanalytic terms, as
we noted previously, commentators on Althusser have criticized the
appropriation of Lacan's theories of the subject in his account of ISAs.
These critics point out that what Althusser misses in Lacan's account is
that [the subject is always incomplete; it is precisely what can never
be fixed by a specific subject position or identity]{.underline}.
However, [the implication of this incompletion is not that the subject
remains some untouched and primordial haven of authenticity but rather
that this lack drives to ever more compulsive]{.underline} (because
[unfulfillable) attempts to attain a definitive identity]{.underline}.
Translating this into political terms, we would say that it is
**[the]{.underline}** inescapably **[incomplete]{.underline}**,
provisional, **[and easily falsified nature of all accounts of
cyberwar]{.underline}** that **[energizes]{.underline}** the adoption of
**[increasingly militarized, extreme, paranoid, and unshakable subject
positions vis-à- vis its alleged events]{.underline}**. [For example,
shortly after the outbreak of the rebellion that grew into the Syrian
civil war, there was an abrupt but near-total shutdown of the Syrian
internet]{.underline}. [A]{.underline} [common]{.underline}
[assumption]{.underline}, at least [in the West, was that this was an
attempt by the Assad regime]{.underline} [to black out online dissent,
as Mubarak had attempted in Egypt]{.underline}. **[But]{.underline}**
**[according to Edward Snowden]{.underline}**, **[the event was caused
by intrusion into the system conducted by the NSA]{.underline}**---[not
intentionally, however, but **by accident**, **in a botched hack of the
Syrian state's communication** and electronic defense
system]{.underline} (Ackerman 2014). [Whereas the first attribution cast
the Assad regime in the conventional role of despotic suppressor of
civil rights, rightly opposed by liberal democracies, the second
reversed the significance of the blackout**, making it evidence
of---once again---NSA cyberaggression against foreign states, and
incompetent aggression at that.**]{.underline} But those opposed to this
characterization could point out that at the time Snowden made his
diagnosis, he was reliant on Russia, a supporter of the Assad regime,
for political asylum. [The blackout of Syria's internet connection thus
also **becomes an epistemological blackout** about its cause, a blackout
in which **every** initial **position** on the politics of Syria's civil
war **could be preserved and reinforced**.]{.underline} To provide a
final example that is closer to home for many readers, as we suggested
in chapter 1, [there is now fairly convincing evidence that Russian
intelligence agencies, whether directly or by proxy, attempted some
intervention in the 2016 U.S. presidential election by way of "fake
news." It is also clear that some of the news reports claiming to
substantiate or expand this claim, by claiming, for example, to detect
Russian hackers in Vermont's power grid or by broadly characterizing a
sweepingly wide range of U.S. media outlets as accomplices of Russian
cyberwar, are inaccurate and tendentious.]{.underline} **[The abyss of
this double falsification]{.underline}**---" **[fake news" compounding
"fake news"---becomes a zero-gravity free-fire zone within which
contending factions within the U.S. political system trade charges of
treason, producing a civil war effect possibly beyond the wildest dreams
of the toilers at the dreary offices of St. Petersburg's Internet
Research Group.]{.underline}**

#### Cyberwar reveals the [collapse of meaning]{.underline} through [informatic erasure]{.underline}, as all information becomes flooded with computational propaganda where [militarized digital catastrophe shapes the present by its future possibility]{.underline} that mirrors and exceeds nuclear war.

*Deconstruction machines: Writing in the age of cyberwar*. University of
Minnesota Press, 2018) \*modified for ableist language

The systems that are attacked through cyberwar are dual entities: on one
hand, they are defined by a series of connections, and on the other
hand, they are defined by the text of programs and messages that are
sent through the network. The networked structure of the global Internet
allows malicious programs to quickly propagate, but it is the insecurity
of individual systems and the computer programs they run that are
exploited to attack these networks. [Without the insecurity
of]{.underline} these [programs and messages]{.underline}, [cyberwar
would never be a strategic possibility]{.underline}. While [computer
programs are often considered to be]{.underline} overly
[deterministic]{.underline} and simply a series of rules for a machine
to follow, [the very existence of cyberwar suggests that programs are
not so straightforward]{.underline}. [Programming is a textual and
**linguistic practice** that is always carried out in languages and at
levels of complexity that preclude complete mastery over what is
written]{.underline}. [Cyberwar infiltrates and subverts these programs,
turning the **text** and logic of the program **against
itself**]{.underline}. [To fully grasp what is at stake in cyberwar, it
is then critical to understand the logic of writing, especially the
logic of writing at its most vulnerable]{.underline}. In this light,
[**cyberwar** is ultimately a process of deconstructing programs and
undermining them from within their own logical and linguistic
systems]{.underline}. As such, it [**is a form of writing itself**, a
writing that is aimed at both **shoring up and deconstructing** **other
texts**]{.underline}. To understand **[cyberwar]{.underline}** in this
way, then, also requires a reconceptualization of deconstruction and its
functioning. [Admitting the textual nature of code and the machinic
force of deconstruction overwhelms any attempt to maintain that
deconstruction has ever been an exclusively **theoretical** matter or
could ever be secured against its possible usage by **the state and
military.**]{.underline} [Cyberwar]{.underline}, [in harnessing and
exploiting the vulnerable and machinic nature of writing, is thus both a
form of deconstruction and a deconstructive threat to deconstruction
itself.]{.underline} Still, this threat to deconstruction and the logic
of writing does not spell the end of deconstruction but rather
guarantees its continued importance to the history of both writing and
metaphysics. GLIMPSES OF THE FUTURE CATASTROPHE One of [the earliest
glimpses of]{.underline} the possible impact of an [all-­out
cyberwar]{.underline} [occurred in June 1997]{.underline}. [A small team
of hackers]{.underline} [using publicly available tools]{.underline} and
programs [was supposedly able to gain access to the]{.underline} power
[grid in nine]{.underline} U.S. [cities]{.underline}, those cities'
emergency response systems, [and]{.underline} a number of [critical
Pentagon networks, including]{.underline} those that managed [military
supply chains and the command-­ and-­ control structure.]{.underline}
According to James Adams, who has written at length about these attacks,
[the]{.underline} [hackers]{.underline} also [managed to infect the
human command-­ and-­ control system with a ~~paralyzing~~ level of
mistrust.]{.underline} Orders that appeared to come from a commanding
general were fake, as were bogus news reports on the crisis and
instructions from the civilian command authorities. As a result, [nobody
in the chain of command, from the president on down, could believe
anything.]{.underline} [This group of hackers using publicly available
resources was able to prevent the United States from waging war
effectively.]{.underline}1 Luckily, [**the** series of **attacks**,
which have been code-­ named Eligible Receiver, **were carried out by the
\[NSA\] National Security Agency as an unannounced test** of military
and civilian digital infrastructure]{.underline}. The attackers, who
were working as part of a No-­Notice Interoperability Exercise Program,
were asked only to prove what was possible and not actually to destroy
anything. Though the military provided no substantial evidence about
Eligible Receiver, aside from interviews with the media and vague
congressional testimony, for a while, [Eligible Receiver was repeatedly
referenced as a brief glimpse of future war and the dark nature of our
digital technologies]{.underline}.2 Of course, there were those who were
sure it [**was** merely **the media-­ security complex displaying its
newest boogeyman.**]{.underline} In a hacking publication titled The
Crypt Newsletter, whose provenance and history seem to have gone the way
of dial-­ up modems but which still lingers in search-­engine-­indexed text
files in various parts of the Internet, [Joseph K refers to Eligible
Receiver as "**a Pentagon ghost story repeated ad nauseum to
journalists** and the easily frightened in which ludicrous or totally
unsubstantiated claims about menaces from cyberspace are passed off as
astonishing deeds of techno-­ legerdemain performed by **cybersoldiers
working within a highly classified wargame.**"]{.underline} Although
Joseph K meant to dismiss Eligible Receiver, the discourse surrounding
it still tells an interesting ghost story, especially if it is treated
as such and read not as baseless but as a myth that functions even
without proof. [John **Arquilla summed up the state of the public
relation** to the event aptly when, in an interview with PBS, he said,
"Eligible Receiver is a classified event about which I can't speak. What
I can say is that when people say there is no existence proof of the
seriousness of the cyber threat, to my mind, Eligible Receiver provides
a convincing existence proof of the nature of the threat that we
face]{.underline}."3 **[This Kafkaesque claim is telling: he cannot tell
us what transpired, but its existence, despite being under classified
erasure, proves his point]{.underline}**. [This event appears in this
light not then as an attack against military information systems but
instead as an attack against our belief in the digital systems that
increasingly provide the fabric of our everyday lives]{.underline}.
Perhaps in Adams's claims that no one could believe anything from the
president on down, we should read a warning that **[we]{.underline}**,
too, **[outside the wargame, can no longer believe
anything---]{.underline}** ­that, **[ultimately, the collapse of the
entire system may already be upon us.]{.underline}** [It takes little
extra imagination to suggest that the implied result is some
catastrophic social collapse, which may already be under way. It is not
merely our military communication technologies that are at stake in
Eligible Receiver but the entirety of society. Computer
systems]{.underline}, especially when seen as data storage devices,
[function to guarantee that past inscriptions persist into the
future]{.underline}. Computer security is often discussed as being
founded on the "CIA triad," standing for confidentiality, integrity, and
access. Confidentially requires that only authorized users have access
to information. Integrity is the need that the information that is put
into a system is the same information that is retrieved, and access
suggests that if authorized users cannot retrieve information, no matter
how secure that information is, the system is useless.4 All of these
function not just in the present but as guarantees of past and future.
[For a system to be secure under these conditions, the system must
assure that the data entered in the past extend into the future and
avoid unauthorized compromise]{.underline}. [Cyberattacks instantly call
all three of these into question in the past, present, and future. **The
futurity of a "real" attack like Eligible Receiver infects our belief in
these systems in the present.**]{.underline} Garrett Schubert, of EMC's
Critical Incident Response Center, tasked with protecting EMC's data
centers from cyberattacks, describes his work directly in relation to a
change in temporality: "**[When I started in my career, the idea was, we
wanted to stop a bad thing from happening. Now, we assume that the bad
thing has already happened.]{.underline}** Every single day, we walk in
and we assume there is an active attack going on."5 **[The future
catastrophe has become a part of the daily operations of our
technologies.]{.underline}** As Parikka claims, **[the inscription of
information in media is the invention of the accident of information
erasure.]{.underline}**6 The database always contains within it the
immanent possibility that the data are, or may be, corrupted. [As much
as this unannounced test exercise may have been a test of military
security, it is also a test of our belief in the future of our digital
world.]{.underline} Joseph K's mocking dismissal then appears, like a
pithy sermon by an unknown sage of our digital belief, to reassure us
that these events are merely phantasms thought up to terrify the
gullible and will never come to pass. At the same time, the complete
dismissal of this ghost story bifurcates the future: on one hand, the
possibility of utter collapse, and on the other, complete faith and
resilience. Likewise, it doubles the structure of belief and skepticism.
[Are the believers those who put faith in our technological world or
those who blindly take the military's word that the catastrophe is
around any corner? If we cannot believe "anyone from the president on
down," how can we believe those who call that belief into
question?]{.underline} THE INFORMATIONAL UNCANNY **[We arrive at an
impasse that mirrors the Cold War nuclear catastrophe, not in terms of
the destruction of life but in terms of the destruction of
meaning.]{.underline}** Though the relationship between the digital and
the symbolic is complex, if the material support of meaning--- be it
magnetic bits, flashes of light in a fiber optic cable, or paper
writing--- is destroyed, then so too is the possibility of meaning. If
the bits that store our digital writing are effaced, so too is any
message they may carry. [A nuclear catastrophe destroys meaning by
destroying potential readers and the material of writing, whereas a
digital catastrophe destroys meaning and inscription by destroying the
microscopic material support]{.underline}. As these digital
communications are entrusted more and more, what is at stake is the
whole system of believing in the integrity of one's information, and
with it the integrity of all systems. We arrive, then, at a similar
situation to what Paul Saint-­Amour refers to as the nuclear uncanny:
"[Because]{.underline} [it offers the possibility of a future without
symptoms, without a symbolic order--- ­ in other words, no future at
all--- the nuclear condition can, in a sense, only cause anticipatory
symptoms]{.underline}."7 Likewise, **[the militarized digital
catastrophe shapes the present by its future possibility.]{.underline}**
Saint-­Amour's argument is helpful in that it places the futurity of such
events clearly in the present. He suggests that [such a catastrophe,
especially because it destroys the symbolic, must produce its effects in
the present]{.underline}. [If this future catastrophe undermines the
symbolic in the present, **we begin to enter a space of what we could
call militarized deconstruction.**]{.underline} [The ability for any
program, database, or text to control its meaning and intent is
instantly destabilized]{.underline}. As Parikka argues, "[apocalypses
reveal new temporalities, new layers for a media archaeology of the
present."]{.underline}8 The possibility of a catastrophe places the full
meaning of programs and networks always in the future but their
symptomatic expression in the present. Their complete **[meaning can
only be understood after their looming breakdown]{.underline}**. In
short, despite the linear and programmatic nature of a program's
execution, [the deferral of meaning and the non-­ self-­ sameness opened
by its potential insecurity guarantee that the relation between the text
of the program and its action in the world is governed by play,
différance, and the impending possibility of its
deconstruction]{.underline}. [**This catastrophic threat** to the future
of databases suggests that they are ultimately shaped by the structure
of what Derrida calls **arche-­writing**]{.underline} ([the originary
structure of non-­ self-­ presence and externalization that shapes all
existence--- the ­ violence of our being in the wor]{.underline}ld). When
Hägglund explains arche-­ writing, we could easily imagine that he is
speaking about a computer rather than a human subject:

#### Cyberwarfare must be understood as fake wars and classified NSA cyberops turning nonwar into war - [a conflict over meaning]{.underline} that erases and rewrites the very archives and epistemes that trace its existence

"INTRODUCTION: Root Kit," Deconstruction machines: Writing in the age of
cyberwar. University of Minnesota Press, 2018)

There is no easily agreed-upon definition of cyberwar. Even within
closely related literatures, [there exists an ongoing debate over what
constitutes cyberwar]{.underline}. Some, such as Rid, who has written at
length declaring **[there is no such thing as cyberwar]{.underline}**,
question whether such a concept is a helpful lens for thinking the
present situation at all.1 The term [cyberwar]{.underline}, in most
invocations, [refers to the notion of cyberspace and the possibility of
a war carried out in this global networked space, wherein computer
systems are taken over to disrupt and surveil an enemy's communication
and networked infrastructure either as part of a "kinetic" war or as a
form of low-level conflict aimed at gaining geopolitical
advantages]{.underline}. Though it is important to follow authors,
strategists, legal scholars, and others wherever they happen to see
"cyberwar" occurring, one particular etymological meaning will guide
this inquiry. The prefix [cyber- refers to the term
cybernetics]{.underline}. **[Cybernetics]{.underline}**, originating
from the Greek kubernētēs ("steersman" or "governor"), [is the science
and study of systems, their structures, regulation, emergent properties,
and possibilities, spanning disciplines from technology to biology to
society]{.underline}. [By explicitly thinking the cyber- in cyberwar as
referring to systems, it will be fruitful to understand cyberwar as a
war against systems: computer systems, state systems, systems of
organization, and even **systems of meaning**.]{.underline} This
etymological understanding of cyberwar closely mirrors some of the
earliest deployments of this term[. One of the first unclassified uses
of the term cyberwar comes from a 1992 publication by
Arnett]{.underline}.2 For him, [the term means the replacement of human
operators with machines that decide on targets, trajectories, movement,
and so on]{.underline}---essentially the culmination of a long history
of the insertion of "intelligent machines" into the arsenal of war
fighting. [That same year, Der Derian used the term "in the sense of a
technologically generated, televisually linked, and strategically gamed
form of violence.]{.underline}"3 Arquilla and Ronfeldt subsequently
published a paper defining cyberwar as a tactical and strategic movement
whereby communication, information, and the visibility of the
battlespace become the central concern. They assert that while
information technology brings [cyberwar]{.underline} to the fore, it [is
not necessarily a technological phenomenon]{.underline}. In fact, [the
exemplary case of cyberwar]{.underline} they recount [is a
thirteenth-century Mongol offensive against Khwarizm, where the Mongols
succeeded in defeating a significantly larger army by cutting off
communications and disrupting the control of forces]{.underline}. These
definitions complement each other. Der Derian and Arnett's definitions
focus on carrying out a kinetic war through the cybernetic organization
of humans and technology, while Arquilla and Ronfeldt's definition
stresses disrupting all of the enemy's cybernetic systems regardless of
whether they are human, technological, or a combination[. We are faced,
then, with something much more expansive than war in cyberspace; rather,
what these authors begin to explore in the early 1990s is an
understanding of war in which one tries to construct and defend systems
of communicating, knowing, controlling, and, ultimately,
existing]{.underline}. Simultaneously, one attempts to disrupt,
infiltrate, corrupt, and destroy these same systems belonging to the
enemy. Arquilla and Ronfeldt state that such a strategy "may aim to
confound people's fundamental beliefs about the nature of their culture,
society, and government, partly to foment fear but perhaps mainly to
disorient people and unhinge their perceptions."4 **[Clearly this is not
completely new]{.underline}**. [Belligerents have always attempted to
deceive their opponents and disrupt economies and
governments]{.underline}. Furthermore, war has often had as a central
objective the destruction of one critical system and the infiltration of
another: the body and the territory of the opponent. Despite this, we
can outline three critical factors that mark cyberwar as a historical
shift. First, proponents of cyberwar, such as Arquilla and Ronfeldt,
stress that [in cyberwar, information and structures of knowing become
central rather than peripheral to conflict]{.underline}. They say that
[cyberwar "means disrupting if not destroying the information and
communications systems, broadly defined to include even military
culture, on which an adversary relies in order to know
itself]{.underline}."5 Second, [cyberwar attempts to disrupt not only
the enemy's knowledge but also the entire structure of
knowledge]{.underline}. In short, **[cyberwar invests epistemology
itself as a battlespace.]{.underline}** Third, [cyberwar seeps outside
of "war" proper]{.underline}. [In calling into question modes of
knowing, cyberwar breaks down the limits of the time and space of
war]{.underline}. Thus the term **[cyberwar describes two distinct but
related phenomena]{.underline}**. On one hand, [it is a strategy for
fighting war, and we will include whatever is named cyberwar by
strategists, legal theorists, authors, and warriors. On the other hand,
we will mean a historical shift---in a sense, a global cyberwar that
marks a tendency whereby the critical element in war becomes the flow of
information and the fortification and disruption of
system]{.underline}s. In making this shift, [cyberwar has opened an
**epistemological** and **cybernetic** **battlespace** wherein **notions
of war**, enmity, and knowing become **directly**
**contestable**]{.underline}. While these concepts have always been
unstable and problematic, [**cyberwar seizes them as systems of direct
military intervention**, turning what was once a question for
**philosophers into a domain of the global battlespace**]{.underline}.
In its most abstract sense, **[cyberwar has become an event that calls
everything including itself into question at the moment it
arrives]{.underline}**. It is the historical possibility that all
systems may break down---or, in their military occupation, be caused to
break down---but [it is also possible that cyberwar may undermine itself
before anything actually "happens]{.underline}." **[Cyberwar as
historical event marks a moment of radical militarized
unknowability.]{.underline}** Many [discussions of cyberwar, be they
historical, strategic, or legal, begin not with the earliest examples or
contemporary attacks but rather with a **future catastrophe** that
demonstrates the danger of our overreliance on vast, connected, yet
vulnerable systems]{.underline}. [These catastrophes normally start with
a **nonstate actor or** a "**rogue**" **state** hacking into key
networks, destroying critical infrastructure in the **United States** or
multiple **European countries.**]{.underline} [Airplanes crash into each
other, trains derail, communication channels shut down, and electrical
systems are disabled]{.underline}. Not only are these systems forced to
shut down but they are hijacked and made to spin out of control,
sometimes destroying themselves so completely that they would take
months to return to normal usage. [These **imagined** **scenarios**
often place the reader at the time immediately following the
catastrophe.]{.underline} At this point in time, one can survey the
wreckage of our technological hubris before the aftermath begins in
earnest. [It is the moment when the full scale of a possible collapse is
revealed but not yet realized]{.underline}.6 **[Where a historical
account begins in the past, it often starts with a CIA attempt to
secretly destroy a Soviet gas pipeline]{.underline}**.7 According to
Thomas Reed, a National Security Council staffer, [in 1982, the CIA was
able to insert an intentionally faulty piece of code into a pump that
the Soviet Union obtained from a Canadian company]{.underline}.
According to Reed's account, [the pump was installed in the
Trans-Siberian gas pipeline; varying pump speeds and valve settings
produced extreme pressures that caused an explosion large enough to be
detected by U.S. satellites]{.underline}. [The secret introduction of a
so-called logic bomb---a somewhat antiquated term for a malicious piece
of code inserted into software---has been touted by a number of
commentators as one of the earliest examples of cyberwar]{.underline}.
Although Reed, who made this story public for the first time in a 2004
book, never referred to this attack as cyberwar, this story has become
something of an origin myth for those who write about cyberwar more
generally.8 [**The event prefigures**]{.underline} a number of issues
that arise again and again in the myriad **[discourses surrounding
cyberwar.]{.underline}** Most important, it becomes clear how vulnerable
complex systems of computation have become. These [systems aggregate
code written across the globe and parts manufactured outside the purview
of their owners into complex networks that belie attempts to control
them. Computation is exposed to the exterior places in which it is
produced.]{.underline} Furthermore, [even if unintentionally, the use of
this event as the first in a series of international cyberattacks offers
an answer to a question that is often asked of theorists of cyberwar:
how can such an event lay claim to being "war"? **Is this merely
sabotage?**]{.underline} [Placing the origin in the Cold
War]{.underline} responds to those critics of cyberwar hype who believe
it is nothing more than a collection of high-tech tools in service of
the ancient techniques of spying, deception, and sabotage. For [the Cold
War proved that wars need not be explosive and could consist of decades
of low-level conflict]{.underline}. [As Virilio says of the threat posed
by nuclear weapons, "the weapon's serious danger is not that it could
explode tomorrow. . . but that for thirty years it has been destroying
society]{.underline}."9 The bomb's destructive power has been felt
directly through its threat. Likewise[, as can be seen in the futuristic
scenarios described earlier, cyberwar seems always to threaten
catastrophe]{.underline}. **[Placing cyberwar's origins in the Cold War
suggests the possibility of a nonwar that is as destructive as a kinetic
war.]{.underline}** The second half of the twentieth century has
demonstrated that even in the absence of a hot war, conflict can destroy
governments and societies. Furthermore, at least for those theorists and
strategists of cyberwar in the United States, this origin story
contextualizes contemporary cyberwar discourses in another way. [Several
military and political commentators writing about cyberwar as a
strategic area of study were the **same theorists** who worked on
nuclear deterrence strategy in the latter part of the Cold
War]{.underline}. [A number of authors]{.underline}---many of [whom work
for the **RAND Corporation**]{.underline}, a think tank that was created
in 1948 to provide research and analysis to the U.S. military---[even
attempt to employ strategies learned from nuclear deterrence research to
mitigate military hacking and offensive use of global
networks]{.underline}.10 Tying the origin of cyberwar to Cold War global
strategic thinking offers an opportunity for those making the transition
from strategizing in a bipolar world defined by nuclear weapons to a
multipolar, interconnected global economy. [While the Siberian pipeline
attack's similarity to contemporary issues surrounding cyberwar is
noteworthy, the most striking aspect of the whole affair **is that it
possibly never happened.**]{.underline} Following the release of Reed's
book, [an ex-KGB officer with direct knowledge of the region at the time
disputes Reed's account]{.underline}. [He acknowledged there was an
explosion but claims it was at a different, smaller pipeline and was
caused by specific construction mistakes, not by faulty
equipment.11]{.underline} Moreover, [no known media reports from the
time confirm an explosion, which Reed claims was the size of a small
nuclear blast]{.underline}. Other than Reed's account, [no other
documentation has been found, and the CIA has never confirmed the
event]{.underline}.12 The origins of cyberwar in this event are
seemingly impossible to verify. Pipeline explosions were common at the
time, and there would have been no way for the CIA to know for certain
if it was caused by their purposefully faulty equipment or accidently
faulty Soviet equipment. Given our current evidence, **[the event is
completely unknowable]{.underline}**. Moreover, even if there was an
explosion, [it is impossible to verify if it was the logic bomb or a
mechanical failure]{.underline}. Depending on one's perspective, [either
the fake event or fake refutations seep into the historical record like
a computer virus corrupting the system's memory]{.underline}. Thus, in a
largely unrecognized way, **[this event is archetypal for
cyberwar.]{.underline}** Cyberwar and cybersecurity weave a complicated
relationship between the knowable and the unknowable. [Our networked
world has become so complex in sheer technical terms that the system as
a whole cannot be known from the outside.]{.underline} [Mapping even
just the public Web has become a scholarly pursuit in its own
right.]{.underline} Computers and networks represent information as tiny
bits on a magnetic disk or pulses of light across a cable that, owing to
their size, speed, and complexity, are on their own essentially
meaningless and impenetrable to human observers. [One always interacts
with abstractions and complex representations of the material reality of
computing.]{.underline} **[Cyberwar, in attacking these systems, is
always on the verge of being meaningless itself]{.underline}**.
Moreover, [in attacking systems of knowing that guarantee information,
**a successful attack impairs even our ability to know if something has
happened**]{.underline}. Cyberwar is fought precisely in this space
between the possible catastrophe and the possibility of nothing
happening at all. The event itself is ambiguous and our public
historical record is already compromised. It could of course be argued
that all history is ambiguous, constructed, and selective. [What is
unique in the case of cyberwar is that the whole structure of knowing
and observing is opened as a site of direct military
intervention]{.underline}. It is not only a question of interpretation
and selective archives. **[The entire archive and our ability to
comprehend the archive may be attacked at any moment]{.underline}**. In
a sense, [we are dealing with a limit case of historical
unknowability---not just ambiguity but **a military attack on the data
of history itself**]{.underline}. Now, [even if the victors write
history, it may no longer be written from data they
control]{.underline}. Thus an effective understanding of cyberwar will
only be possible by not prematurely deciding in favor of an event
happening or not happening. [Cyberwar operates both as a strategy and as
a mediatized cultural phenomenon directly in the space between happening
and not happening]{.underline}. [**It succeeds as a military strategy by
never succeeding too much.** It always seems to be leading us to the
verge of catastrophe and at the same time to an **interminable boredom
where nothing will ever actually happen**]{.underline}. Cyberwar could
easily be dismissed as not really being war or violent, but **[what is
so virulent and dangerous about cyberwar is its ability to atomize and
distribute warfare into everyday life.]{.underline}** Cyberwar succeeds
so much more effectively for being either overhyped or dismissed.
[Ultimately, we must resist deciding in favor of catastrophe or boredom,
for in doing so, the entirety of cyberwar will certainly escape us.
**Instead, we must attempt to interrogate the history and discourses of
cyberwar** by following its vacillations between these two poles as it
hides **in the theoretical space between war and nonwar**]{.underline}.

### Datafication

#### The escalation of turning the human into data produces a process where human and technology are merged to become an efficient information processor -- a dystopian endpoint. 

**Steuer 19** (Daniel, is research fellow at the Centre for Applied
Philosophy, Politics,

It is not at all inconceivable that it will soon be possible to mortgage
your body (to promise your organs or tissue for donation, for instance,
in order to raise capital or service your debts), in particular if---in
line with the fundamental contradiction of universal monoculture---[the
very [body of the neoliberal (in)dividual]{.mark} will be [seen as
nothing but data]{.mark}.]{.underline} The [[Visible Human
Project]{.mark}, the [translation of an entire human corpse into
data]{.mark} sets, which [began]{.mark} [in]{.mark} the early
[1990s]{.mark}, [rests]{.mark} on "an equation of digital code with
vitality" and [on]{.mark} th[e "desire for bodies to behave as]{.mark}
closed [mechanical systems]{.mark} with reversible temporalities, rather
than as non-reversible, chaotic systems]{.underline} which necessarily
move towards death."183 Whether or not the project is medically useful,
it bears all the hallmarks of our universal monoculture. In particular,
the changes that the body undergoes in the process of being translated
into data are considered a technical problem that can be solved. [The
categori[cal difference between life and death is slowly erased by
techn]{.mark}ological [improvements]{.mark} [until]{.mark}
[flesh-andblood bodies and digital]{.mark} revenants [become]{.mark}
[indistinguishable]{.mark}.184]{.underline} Foucault's lectures from
1977/78 and 1978/79 have been read as "a coherent argument for the
positive force of globalization."185 And, in fact, one might go further
and suggest that, in his notions of power and the dispositif, one can
observe a mimetic approval of neoliberalism (and universal monoculture).
Then there are Jean-Luc Nancy's reflections on "struction," on a world
in which Being has been replaced by "being with" and in which it is
"truly not a question of order or organization that is implied by con-
and instruction." Aimed against extraction and hierarchy, they end with
"the heap, the non-assembled ensemble. Surely it is contiguity and
co-presence, but without a principle of coordination."186 Again there
arises the question of how to distinguish between the Manichean
alternatives, between the liberated (and liberating?) nonassembled
ensemble and an all-pervasive, invisible coordination that favors
partial interests. Another example is Gilles Deleuze and Félix
Guattari's nomadic war machine.187 Its form corresponds to global
partisan warfare; it turns the planet into a "smooth space" onto which
"striated spaces" are projected (see the discussion of flow markets, the
global frontierland, and drone targeting above). Nomadism is not the
opposite of hierarchical or state power; rather, state power contains
nomadism and vice versa. In the field of sociology, we find Neil
Fligstein and Doug McAdam's strategic action fields (SAFs), "the basic
structural building block of modern political/organizational life in the
economy, civil society, and the state."188 SAFs form a fleeting world of
metastable "socially constructed arenas" in which "actors with varying
resource endowments vie for advantage:"189 "All the meanings in a field
can break down including what the purpose of the field is. . . . \[T\]he
process of contention is ongoing and the threats to an order always
present to some degree."190 But perhaps the most [perfect
[example]{.mark} [o]{.mark}f theoretical [mimesis is]{.mark} Jean
[Baudrillard's]{.mark}]{.underline} "[[ultimate reality of impossible
exchang]{.mark}e]{.underline}," the "Impossible Exchange Barrier."191
Here, [universal exchange is turned on its head. Setting out from the
observation that "[there is no equivalent to the
world]{.mark},"]{.underline}192 Baudrillard argues that there are no
equivalences in the world, that a "continuity of the Nothing . . .
grounds the possibility of the Great Game of Exchange,"193 and he
concludes that the "[whole [problem is one of abandoning critical
thought]{.mark}" as it is now anachronistic.194 Instead, the "[task of
thought" is to make the world]{.mark} "[even more enigmatic and
unintelligible."]{.mark}]{.underline}195 This, despite the perceptive
qualities of the text, is the ultimate confirmation of universal
monoculture through its seeming reversal.196 CONCLUSION The [[dystopian
endpoint is not a world that has been taken over by machines and
programs that develop and follow their own
agenda]{.underline}]{.mark}---the singularity nightmare. [The [real
dystopian endpoint is]{.mark} a world in which the [process of mutual
formation between humanity and]{.mark} its [tech]{.mark}nological
inventions has [produced a state in which both the human and]{.mark} the
[nonhuman worlds are modeled on just one]{.mark},]{.underline} in its
foundational principles very limited, invention---[[the information
processor]{.underline}]{.mark}---and there is no longer any imaginative
space in which alternatives might be created. The
[[danger]{.underline}]{.mark} is neither technology destroying the
world---this is also a danger but a different one---nor the reduction of
the social to the technological but the [[social becoming locked into
the technological to the point of indistinction]{.underline}.]{.mark} If
this happens within a capitalist economic framework, [then the
[result]{.mark} will be a kind of [dysfunctional stasis]{.mark}, a
[lingering apocalypse]{.mark}, [life as continual warfare]{.mark}, with
techno-economic partisans permanently being engaged in [instantaneous
value extraction]{.mark}]{.underline}.197 The [[indistinctions
that]{.mark} today [make themselves felt empirically]{.mark} and in
[attempts at theoretical explanation]{.mark} [will have become a
complete homogeneity]{.mark} that may no longer even deserve the
adjective "social."]{.underline} We have [[moved from conceptual
indistinctions]{.mark} in the description [of]{.mark}]{.underline} the
emerging world of [[war]{.underline}]{.mark} [[to the mimetic escalation
that drives it forward and produces the "security
paradigm]{.underline}]{.mark}," which is applied to the world as system,
the "world" (or the world seen under the spell of universal
convertibility). If Sohn-Rethel's exchange abstraction is a plausible
framework for looking at this development, then partisan escalation (at
the level of practice) and theoretical escalation (at the conceptual
level) are two codependent factors in the overall process of mimetic
escalation. The world is more and more organized as the "world;"
individual actors conceive of themselves more and more as reflex
(in-)dividuals seeking instantaneous advantage, and any perspective
outside the self-referential universal monoculture is more and more
difficult to achieve. Thus, my reflections must admit that they, too,
end with a Manichean alternative: that between a world of blind practice
and a world in which Selbstbesinnung is still possible.198

### Death

#### Their conception and projection of death as a biological end to life denies the value of death as a reversible and subjective transformation, creating a securitization against death from which social control is made possible and life is reduced to a capitalist prolongation and prohibition of death. This lays the foundation for all exclusions against what is deemed "abnormal," and makes war, genocide, and discrimination inevitable.

**Robinson 12.** Andrew Robinson, political theorist and activist based
in the UK, "An A to Z of Theory \| Jean Baudrillard: The Rise of
Capitalism & the Exclusion of Death" Ceasefire Magazine, March 30, 2012,
<https://ceasefiremagazine.co.uk/in-theory-baudrillard-2/>

The passage to capitalism: [Symbolic exchange -- or rather, its
suppression -- plays a central role in the emergence of
capitalism.]{.underline} Baudrillard sees a change happening over time.
[Regimes based on symbolic exchange]{.underline} (differences are
exchangeable and related) [are replaced by regimes based on
equivalence]{.underline} (everything is, or means, the same). Ceremony
gives way to spectacle, immanence to transcendence. Baudrillard's view
of capitalism is derived from Marx's analysis of value. Baudrillard
accepts Marx's view that capitalism is based on a general equivalent.
Money is the general equivalent because it can be exchanged for any
commodity. In turn, it expresses the value of abstract labour-time.
Abstract labour-time is itself an effect of the regimenting of processes
of life, so that different kinds of labour can be compared. [Capitalism
is]{.underline} derived from the autonomisation or separation of
economics from the rest of life. It turns economics into the
'reality-principle'. It is a kind of sorcery, [connected in some way to
the disavowed symbolic level. It subtly shifts the social world from an
exchange of death with the Other to an eternal return of the
Same.]{.underline} Capitalism functions by reducing everything to a
regime based on value and the production of value. [To be accepted by
capital, something must contribute value]{.underline}. This creates an
immense regime of social exchange. However, this social exchange has
little in common with symbolic exchange. It ultimately depends on the
mark of value itself being unexchangeable. [Capital must be endlessly
accumulated.]{.underline} States must not collapse. Capitalism thus
introduces the irreversible into social life, by means of accumulation.
[According to Baudrillard, capitalism rests on an obsession with the
abolition of death. Capitalism tries to abolish death through
accumulation. It tries to ward off ambivalence (associated with death)
through value (associated with life.]{.underline} But this is bound to
fail. [General equivalence -- the basis of capitalism -- is itself the
ever-presence of death. The more the system runs from death, the more it
places everyone in solitude, facing their own death. Life itself is
fundamentally ambivalent. **The attempt to abolish death through fixed
value is itself deathly.**]{.underline} Accumulation also spreads to
other fields. [The idea of progress, and linear time,]{.underline} comes
from [the accumulation of time,]{.underline} and of stockpiles of the
past. The idea of truth comes from the [accumulation of scientific
knowledge. Biology rests on the separation of living and non-living.
According to Baudrillard, such accumulations are now in crisis. For
instance, the accumulation of the past is undermined, because historical
objects now have to be concealed to be preserved -- otherwise they will
be destroyed by excessive consumption.]{.underline} Value is produced
from the residue or remainder of an incomplete symbolic exchange. The
repressed, market value, and sign-value all come from this remainder. To
destroy the remainder would be to destroy value. Capitalist exchange is
always based on negotiation, even when it is violent. The symbolic order
does not know this kind of equivalential exchange or calculation. And
capitalist extraction is always one-way. It amounts to a non-reversible
aggression in which one act (of dominating or killing) cannot be
returned by the other. [It is also this regime which produces
scarcity]{.underline} -- Baudrillard here endorses Sahlins' argument.
[Capitalism produces the Freudian "death drive", which is actually an
effect of the capitalist culture of death.]{.underline} For Baudrillard,
the limit to both [Marx and Freud]{.underline} is that they [fail to
theorise the separation of]{.underline} the domains they study -- [the
economy and the unconscious.]{.underline} It is the separation which
grounds their functioning, which therefore only occurs under the regime
of the code. Baudrillard also criticises theories of desire, including
those of Deleuze, Foucault, Freud and Lacan. He believes desire comes
into existence based on repression. It is an effect of the denial of the
symbolic. Liberated energies always leave a new remainder; they do not
escape the basis of the unconscious in the remainder. Baudrillard argues
that indigenous groups do not claim to live naturally or by their
desires -- they simply claim to live in societies. This social life is
an effect of the symbolic. Baudrillard therefore criticises the view
that human liberation can come about through the liberation of desire.
He thinks that such a liberation will keep certain elements of the
repression of desire active. Baudrillard argues that the processes which
operate collectively in indigenous groups are repressed into the
unconscious in metropolitan societies. This leads to the autonomy of the
psyche as a separate sphere. It is only after this repression has
occurred that a politics of desire becomes conceivable. He professes
broad agreement with the Deleuzian project of unbinding energies from
fixed categories and encouraging flows and intensities. However, he is
concerned that capitalism can recuperate such releases of energy,
disconnecting them so they can eventually reconnect to it. Unbinding and
drifting are not fatal to capitalism, because capitalism itself unbinds
things, and re-binds things which are unbound. What is fatal to it is,
rather, reversibility. Capitalism continues to be haunted by the forces
it has repressed. Separation does not destroy the remainder. Quite the
opposite. The remainder continues to exist, and gains power from its
repression. This turns the double or shadow into something unquiet,
vampiric, and threatening. It becomes an image of the forgotten dead.
Anything which reminds us of the repressed aspects excluded from the
subject is experienced as uncanny and threatening. It becomes the
'obscene', which is present in excess over the 'scene' of what is
imagined. This is different from theories of lack, such as the Lacanian
Real. Baudrillard's remainder is an excess rather than a lack. It is the
carrier of the force of symbolic exchange. Modern culture dreams of
radical difference. The reason for this is that it exterminated radical
difference by simulating it. The energy of production, the unconscious,
and signification all in fact come from the repressed remainder. Our
culture is dead from having broken the pact with monstrosity, with
radical difference. [The West continues to perpetrate genocide on
indigenous groups. But for Baudrillard, it did the same thing to itself
first -- destroying its own indigenous logics of symbolic exchange.
Indigenous groups have also increasingly lost the symbolic dimension, as
modern forms of life have been imported or imposed. This]{.underline}
according to Baudrillard [produces chronic confusion and instability.
Gift-exchange is radically subversive]{.underline} of the system. This
is not because it is rebellious. Baudrillard thinks the system can
survive defections or exodus. It is [because it counterposes a different
'principle of sociality']{.underline} to that of the dominant system.
According to Baudrillard, the mediations of capitalism exist so that
nobody has the opportunity to offer a symbolic challenge or an
irreversible gift. They exist to keep the symbolic at bay. [The
affective charge of death remains present among the
oppressed]{.underline}, but not with the 'properly symbolic rhythm' of
immediate retaliation. The Church and State also exist based on the
elimination of symbolic exchange. Baudrillard is highly critical of
Christianity for what he takes to be a cult of suffering, solitude and
death. He sees the Church as central to the destruction of earlier forms
of community based on symbolic exchange. Baudrillard seems to think that
earlier forms of the state and capitalism retained some degree of
symbolic exchange, but in an alienated, partially repressed form. For
instance, the imaginary of the 'social contract' was based on the idea
of a sacrifice -- this time of liberty for the common good. In
psychoanalysis, symbolic exchange is displaced onto the relationship to
the master-signifier. I haven't seen Baudrillard say it directly, but
the impression he gives is that this is a distorted, authoritarian
imitation of the original symbolic exchange. Nonetheless, it retains
some of its intensity and energy. Art, theatre and language have worked
to maintain a minimum of ceremonial power. It is the reason older orders
did not suffer the particular malaise of the present. It is easy to read
certain passages in Baudrillard as if he is bemoaning the loss of these
kinds of strong significations. This is initially how I read
Baudrillard's work. But on closer inspection, this seems to be a
misreading. Baudrillard is nostalgic for repression only to the extent
that the repressed continued to carry symbolic force as a referential.
He is nostalgic for the return of symbolic exchange, as an aspect of
diffuse, autonomous, dis-alienated social groups. Death: Death plays a
central role in Baudrillard's theory, and is closely related to symbolic
exchange. According to Baudrillard, [what we have lost above all in the
transition to alienated society is the ability to engage in exchanges
with death. Death should not be seen here in purely literal terms.
Baudrillard specifies early on that he does not mean an event affecting
a body, but rather]{.underline}, [**a form which destroys the
determinacy of the subject** **and of value** -- which returns things to
a state of indeterminacy.]{.underline} Baudrillard certainly discusses
actual deaths, risk-taking, suicide and so on. But he also sees death
figuratively, in relation to the decomposition of existing relations,
the "death" of the self-image or ego, the interchangeability of
processes of life across different categories. [For instance, eroticism
or sexuality is related to death, because it leads to fusion and
communication between bodies. Sexual reproduction carries shades of
death because one generation replaces another.]{.underline}
Baudrillard's concept of death is thus quite similar to Bakhtin's
concept of the grotesque. [Death refers to metamorphosis, reversibility,
unexpected mutations, social change, subjective transformation, as well
as physical death.]{.underline} According to Baudrillard, [indigenous
groups see death as social, not natural or biological. They see it as an
effect of an adversarial will, which they must absorb.]{.underline} And
[they mark it with feasting and rituals]{.underline}. [**This is a way
of preventing death from becoming an event which does not
signify**.]{.underline} Such a non-signifying event is absolute disorder
from the standpoint of symbolic exchange. For Baudrillard, [the west's
idea of a biological, material death is actually an idealist illusion,
ignoring the sociality of death.]{.underline} Poststructuralists
generally maintain that the problems of the present are rooted in the
splitting of life into binary oppositions. [For Baudrillard, the
division between life and death is the original, founding opposition on
which the others are founded. After this first split, a whole series of
others have been created, confining particular groups -- the "mad",
prisoners, children, the old, sexual minorities, women and so on -- to
particular segregated situations. The definition of the 'normal human'
has been narrowed over time. Today, nearly everyone belongs to one or
another marked or deviant category. The original exclusion was of the
dead -- it is defined as abnormal to be dead.]{.underline} "You livies
hate us deadies". [This first split and exclusion forms the basis, or
archetype, for all the other splits and exclusions -- along lines of
gender, disability, species, class, and so on.]{.underline} This
discrimination against the dead brings into being the modern experience
of death. Baudrillard suggests that death as we know it does not exist
outside of this separation between living and dead. [The modern view of
death is constructed on the model of the machine and the
function.]{.underline} [A machine either functions or it does not. The
human body is treated as a machine which similarly, either functions or
does not. For Baudrillard]{.underline}, [this misunderstands the nature
of life and death.]{.underline} The modern view of death is also
necessitated by the rise of subjectivity. [The subject needs a beginning
and an end, so]{.underline} as to be reducible to the story it tells.
This [requires an idea of death as an end.]{.underline} It is
counterposed to the immortality of social institutions. In relation to
individuals, ideas of religious immortality is simply an ideological
cover for the real exclusion of the dead. But institutions try to remain
truly immortal. [Modern systems, especially bureaucracies, no longer
know how to die -- or how to do anything but keep reproducing
themselves.]{.underline} [The internalisation of the idea of the
subject]{.underline} or the soul alienates us from our bodies, voices
and so on. It creates a split, as Stirner would say, between the
category of 'man' and the 'un-man', the real self irreducible to such
categories. It also [individualises people, by destroying their actual
connections to others.]{.underline} The symbolic haunts the code as the
threat of its own death. The society of the code works constantly to
ward off the danger of irruptions of the symbolic. The mortal body is
actually an effect of the split introduced by the foreclosure of death.
The split never actually stops exchanges across the categories. In the
case of death, [we still 'exchange' with the dead through our own deaths
and our anxiety about death.]{.underline} We no longer have living,
mortal relationships with objects either. They are reduced to the
instrumental. It is as if we have a transparent veil between us.
[Symbolic exchange is based on a game, with game-like rules. When this
disappears, **laws and the state are invented to take their
place**.]{.underline} [It is the process of excluding, marking, or
barring which allows concentrated or transcendental power to come into
existence.]{.underline} Through splits, people turn the other into their
'imaginary'. For instance, [westerners invest the "Third World" with
racist fantasies and revolutionary aspirations]{.underline}; the "Third
World" invests the west with aspirational fantasies of development. In
separation, the other exists only as an imaginary object. [Yet the
resultant purity is illusory.]{.underline} For Baudrillard, any such
marking or barring of the other brings the other to the core of society.
["We all" become dead, or mad, or prisoners, and so on, through their
exclusion. **The goal of 'survival' is fundamental to the birth of
power. Social control emerges when the union of the living and the dead
is shattered, and the dead become prohibited.**]{.underline} The social
repression of death grounds the repressive socialisation of life.
[People are compelled to survive so as to become useful.]{.underline}
For Baudrillard, capitalism's original relationship to death has
historically been concealed by the system of production, and its ends.
It only becomes fully visible now this system is collapsing, and
production is reduced to operation. [In modern societies, death is made
invisible, denied, and placed outside society.]{.underline} [For
example, elderly people are excluded from society. People no longer
expect their own death. As a result, it becomes unintelligible. It keeps
returning as 'nature which will not abide by objective laws'. It can no
longer be absorbed through ritual]{.underline}. [Western society is
arranged so death is never done by someone else, but always
**attributable to 'nature'**.]{.underline} [This creates a bureaucratic,
judicial regime of death]{.underline}, of which the concentration camp
is the ultimate symbol. **[The system now commands that we must not
die]{.underline}** -- at least not in any old way. **[We may only die if
law and medicine allow it.]{.underline}** Hence for instance the spread
of health and safety regulations. On the other hand, **[murder and
violence are legalised, provided they can be re-converted into economic
value. Baudrillard sees this as a regressive redistribution of
death.]{.underline}** It is wrested from the circuit of social exchanges
and **[vested in centralised agencies.]{.underline}** For Baudrillard,
there is not a social improvement here. People are effectively being
killed, or left to die, by a process which never treats them as having
value. On the other hand, even when capitalism becomes permissive,
inclusive and tolerant, it still creates an underlying anxiety about
being reduced to the status of an object or a marionette. This appears
as a constant fear of being manipulated. [The slave remains within the
master's dialectic for as long as 'his' life or death serves the
reproduction of domination.]{.underline} A fatal ontology?: In Fatal
Strategies, Baudrillard suggests an ontology which backs up his analysis
of death. The world itself is committed to extremes and to radical
antagonism. It is bored of meaning. There is an 'evil genie', a
principle of Evil which constantly returns in the form of seduction.
Historical processes are really pushed forward by this principle. All
energy comes from fission and rupture. These cannot be replaced by
production or mechanical processes. There is no possibility of a
collective project or a coherent society, only the operation of such
forces. Every order exists only to be transgressed and dismantled. [The
world is fundamentally unreal. This leads to a necessity of
irony,]{.underline} which is to say, [the slippage of
meaning.]{.underline} Historically, the symbolic was confined to the
metaphysical. It did not affect the physical world. But [with the rise
of models]{.underline}, with the physical world derived increasingly
from the code, [the physical world is brought within the symbolic. It
becomes reversible.]{.underline} The rational principle of linear
causality collapses. [The world is, and always remains, enigmatic.
People will give for seduction or]{.underline} for [simulation what they
would never give for quality of life.]{.underline} Advertising, fashion,
gambling and so on liberate 'immoral energies' which hark back to the
magical or archaic gamble on the power of thought against the power of
reality. Neoliberalism is in some ways an ultimate release of such
diabolical forces. People will look for an ecstatic excess of anything
-- even boredom or oppression. In this account, the principle of evil
becomes the only fixed point. Desire is not inescapable. [What is
inescapable is the object and its seduction, its 'principle of evil'.
The object at once submits to law and breaks it in
practice]{.underline}, mocking it. Its own "game" cannot be discerned.
It is a poor conductor of the symbolic order but a good conductor of
signs. [The drive towards spectacles, illusions and scenes is stronger
than the desire for survival.]{.underline}

#### The separation of life and death is the primary force of social control.

**Baudrillard 76 (Jean, the hyperreal slim shady, *Symbolic Exchange and
Death*, pp. 129-132) //**

Death Power [[The emergence of survival can]{.mark} therefore [be
analysed as the fundamental operation in the birth of
power]{.mark}]{.underline}. Not only because [[this]{.mark} set-up [will
permit the necessity of]{.mark} the [sacrifice of this life and the
threat of recompense in the next]{.mark}]{.underline} (this is exactly
the priest-caste\'s strategy), [but more profoundly by instituting the
prohibition of death]{.underline} and, at the same time, the agency that
oversees this prohibition of death: power. [**[Shattering the union of
the living and the dead, and slapping a prohibition on death and the
dead]{.mark}: [the primary source of social control. Power is possible
only if death is no longer free]{.mark}**, only if the dead are put
under surveillance, in anticipation of the future confinement of
[life]{.mark} in its entirety]{.underline}. This is the fundamental Law,
and power is the guardian at the gates of this Law. It is not the
repression of unconscious pulsions, libido, or whatever other energy
that is fundamental, and it is not anthropological; [it [is the
repression of death]{.mark}, the social repression of death in the sense
that this is what facilitates the shift towards the repressive
socialisation of life]{.underline}. Historically, we know that
[sacerdotal power is based on a monopoly over death and exclusive
control over relations with the dead]{.underline}. 4 The dead are the
first restricted area, the exchange of whom is restored by an obligatory
mediation by the priests. [[Power is established on death\'s
borders]{.underline}. [It will subsequently be sustained by further
separations]{.underline}]{.mark} (the soul and the body, the male and
the female, good and evil, etc.) that have infinite ramifications, but
[the principal separation is between life and death]{.underline}.5 When
the French say that power \'holds the bar\',6 it is no metaphor: it is
the bar between life and death, the decree that suspends exchange
between life and death, the tollgate and border control between the two
banks. This is precisely the way in which power will later be instituted
between the subject separated from its body, between the individual
separated from its social body, between man separated from his labour:
the agency of mediation and representation flourishes in this rupture.
We must take note, however, that the archetype of this operation is the
separation between a group and its dead, or between each of us today and
our own deaths. Every form of power will have something of this smell
about it, because it is on the manipulation and administration of death
that power, in the final analysis, is based. **[[All the agencies of
repression and control are installed in this divided
space]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[in the suspense between a life and
its]{.mark} proper [end]{.mark}, that is, in the production of a
literally fantastic and artificial temporality]{.underline} (since at
every instant every life has its proper death there already, that is to
say, in this same instant lies the finality it attains). [[The]{.mark}
first [abstract social time is installed in this rupture of]{.mark} the
indivisible unity of [life and death]{.mark}]{.underline} (well before
abstract social labour time!). [[All the future forms of
alienation]{.mark} that Marx denounces, the separations and abstractions
of political economy, [take root in this separation of
death]{.mark}]{.underline}. The economic operation consists in life
taking death hostage. This is a residual life which can from now on be
read in the operational terms of calculation and value. For example, in
Chamisso\'s The Man who Lost his Shadow, Peter Schlemil becomes a rich
and powerful capitalist once his shadow has been lost (once death is
taken hostage: the pact with the Devil is only ever a political-economic
pact). [**[Life given over to death: the very operation of the
symbolic]{.mark}**. [The Exchange of Death in the Primitive Order
Savages have no biological concept of death]{.mark}]{.underline}. Or
rather, the biological fact, that is, death, birth or disease,
everything that comes from nature and that we accord the privilege of
necessity and objectivity, quite simply has no meaning for them[. [This
is absolute disorder, since it cannot be symbolically exchanged, and
what cannot be symbolically exchanged constitutes a mortal danger for
the group]{.underline}]{.mark}. 7 [They are unreconciled]{.underline},
unexpiated, sorcerous and hostile forces that prowl around the soul and
the body, [[that stalk the living and the dead]{.mark}; defunct, [cosmic
energies that]{.mark} the group [was unable to bring under control
through exchange]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [We have de-socialised
death by overturning bio-anthropological laws, by according it the
immunity of science and by making it autonomous]{.underline}, as
individual fatality. But the physical materiality of death, which
paralyses us through the \'objective\' credence we give it, does not
stop the primitives. They have never \'naturalised\' death, they know
that death (like the body, like the natural event) is a social relation,
that its definition is social. In this they are much more
\'materialist\' than we are, since for them the real materiality of
death, like that of the commodity for Marx, lies in its form, which is
always the form of a social relation. Instead, all our idealism
converges on the illusion of a biological materiality of death: our
discourse of \'reality\', which is in fact the discourse of the
imaginary, surpasses the primitives in the intervention of the symbolic.
Initiation is the accented beat of the operation of the symbolic. It
aims neither to conjure death away, nor to \'overcome\' it, but to
articulate it socially. As R. Jaulin describes in La Mort Sara \[Paris:
Plon, 1967\], the ancestral group \'swallows the koys\' (young
initiation candidates), who die \'symbolically\' in order to be reborn.
Above all, we must avoid understanding this according to the degraded
meaning we attach to it, but in the sense that their death becomes the
stakes of a reciprocal-antagonistic exchange between the ancestors and
the living. Further, instead of a break[, a social relation between the
partners is established]{.underline}, a circulation of gifts and
counter-gifts as intense as the circulation of precious goods and women:
an incessant play of responses where death can no longer establish
itself as end or agency. [By offering her a piece of flesh, the brother
gives his wife to a dead member of the family, in order to bring him
back to life.]{.underline} By nourishing her, this dead man is included
in the life of the group. [But the exchange is reciprocal]{.underline}.
The dead man gives his wife, the clan\'s land, to a living member of the
family in order to come back to life by assimilating himself to her and
to bring her back to life by assimilating her to himself. The important
moment is when the moh (the grand priests) put the koy (the initiates)
to death, so that the latter are then consumed by their ancestors, then
the earth gives birth to them as their mother had given birth to them.
After having been \'killed\', the initiates are left in the hands of
their initiatory, \'cultural\' parents, who instruct them, care for them
and train them (initiatory birth).

#### The abolition of death is based on the humanistic flight from death that perpetuates anxiety and alienation

**Perniola 11** (Mario, University of Turin, "Being-Towards-Death and
the Simulacrum of Death: Heidegger and Baudrillard", translated by Chris
Turner, Duke University Press, Cultural Politics, Volume 7, Issue 3,
November 2011, pp. 345-358)

One of the essential achievements of Being and Time is the setting-aside
of the metaphysical conception of death. Within that conception lie not
merely the theological idea of death, understood as entry into another
life, but also its humanist conception, which regards death as an alien
simple-presence, or as being linked in a purely extrinsic way with human
life. Heidegger writes, "Death is a way to be, which Dasein takes over
as soon as it is."1 What the naturalistic definition signifies,
[understanding death as decease, is not only extremely reductive, but
also of a piece with a conception of existence grasped as
simple-presence]{.underline} -- that is to say, as excluding any
being-possible, and hence metaphysical in its derivation. The
theological conception of death as entry into eternity is based on a
metaphysical theory of man conceived in the image of God;2 similarly,
**[[the humanistic conception of death understood as decease]{.mark}
(that is to say, analyzed from the anthropological, psychological, or
biological standpoint) [is based on an equally metaphysical theory of
man -- of man conceived as constant permanence or as constant
simple-presence]{.mark}]{.underline}**.3 Death cannot be wrested away
from metaphysics unless man is too or, in other words, unless
possibility is implicit in the concept of being-there (Dasein).
According to Heidegger, it is in this way that death becomes the most
proper, most authentic possibility of Dasein.¶ Like Heidegger,
Baudrillard brings out the basic solidarity between the theological and
humanist viewpoints, their common concern being to keep life and death
tidily separated: "Life is life, and death is always death."4 Theology
and [[humanism]{.mark} both [conceive life as an identity entirely
unrelated to death, as an absolute positivity that must at all costs be
distinguished from nothingness:]{.mark} both aspire [to **abolish
death**]{.mark}, the one through the eternity of the spirit, the other
through the indefinite development of the scientific
process]{.underline}. Underlying each is a concept of time linked to
political economy and modeled on the idea of unlimited accumulation.¶
Theology and [humanism may be regarded as the theoretical formulation of
an extremely common form of everyday behavior which consists in not
thinking about death, in acting as though it did not exist, and in
providing a "constant tranquillization"]{.underline} (ständige
Beruhigung) about it.5 For Heidegger,
**[[alienation]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Entfremdung) **[[consists]{.mark}
precisely [in this]{.mark} [flight from death]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[[which pushes Dasein into a fallacious self-confusion]{.mark} that is
sometimes misinterpreted as "perfection" or "concrete
life."]{.underline} The parading of an indifferent tranquility in the
face of the fact (Tatsache) that one dies constitutes "evasive
concealment" (verhüllendes Ausweichen) towards Dasein's
being-towards-the-end. [It obliterates the fact (Faktum) "that **[each
person's Dasein has effectively always been
dying]{.mark}."**]{.underline} [Dasein's **[fleeing from the encounter
with itself]{.mark}**, with its most specific potentiality -- that is to
say, **the encounter with death -- is strictly linked to the affective
condition of anxiety**]{.underline}. Unlike fear, [anxiety does not
involve a threat from some determinate entity in the world, but remains
totally undetermined]{.underline}: "That in the face of which anxiety is
anxious is Being-in-the-world itself,"6 namely "the nothing and nowhere"
that characterize it phenomenally. Anxiety is linked to the fact of
feeling estranged or uncanny (unheimlich), of "not-being-at-home"
(Nichtzuhause-sein). [This Unheimlichkeit or uncanniness harasses Dasein
and threatens it, if only implicitly: everydayness is constantly engaged
in acts of diversion in the attempt to eliminate it]{.underline}. But
that flight turns out to be futile: "Anxiety can arise in the most
innocuous Situations";7 it constitutes the basic affective situation of
everyday life.¶ Baudrillard in turn discovers that [a [rejection of
death lies at the basis of Western everydayness]{.mark}: "**little by
little, [the dead cease to exist. They are thrown out of the group's
symbolic circulation]{.mark}."**]{.underline}8 [Contemporary daily life
rigorously proscribes death: the fact of being dead "is not normal"; it
is an inconceivable anomaly]{.underline}. Unlike primitive cultures,
which are established on the basis of an intense relation of symbolic
reversibility between life and death, **[modern [Western civilization
pronounces a virtual prohibition on death, excluding it from the sphere
of its experience]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[This pretension [to
eradicate the experience of death is linked to the effort of material
production and accumulation on the part of the capitalist
economy]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This is why [it is in modern society
that death becomes death drive]{.underline} [insofar]{.underline},
precisely, [as it is repressed, rejected, and kept in the
Unconscious]{.underline}. Baudrillard thus provides a historical-social
interpretation of the Freudian concept of the death drive, which removes
this from the metaphysical context in which psychoanalysis locates it.
[[Death becomes this repressed]{.mark} [drive which returns]{.mark}
everywhere in daily life, doing so [in the form of anxiety about
death]{.mark}]{.underline}: [the absence of channels to enable symbolic
exchange with death and its acknowledgment within society considerably
amplifies death's force by transforming it into a hidden, subterranean
psychological power that is all the more obsessive for being the less
evident]{.underline}: "**[If the cemetery no longer exists, that is
because modern cities have entirely taken over its function: they are
dead cities and cities of death]{.underline}**,"9 precisely because
**[[death is symbolically absent from them, but subterraneanly
sovereign]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

#### The otherization of death creates a violent duality.

**Smith 16** (Laura Katherine, PhD candidate in Literature and Culture
at KU Leuven, Belgium, "Trans-Baudrillard: Towards a Seductive
Immunity", Parallax, 22:3, 330-346, DOI: 10.1080/13534645.2016.1201923)

A rhetoric of division underpins what Baudrillard calls [modernity's
'production of the other']{.underline}. 24 This is [Baudrillard's
critique of the production/consumption of difference]{.underline}.
**[[The production of difference]{.mark} ironically [perpetuates a
society of sameness because]{.mark} such [false categorical division
masks the problematic suppression of]{.mark} what Baudrillard calls
['the symbolic reproduction of the other]{.mark}']{.underline}**. 25
Here, the reader is confronted with Baudrillard's employment of concepts
as particularly two-fold. In opposition to modernity's 'production of
the other', [[Baudrillard's 'other' is defined as 'illness, death,
negativity, violence \[and\] strangeness' and is characterized
as]{.mark} 'absent[, enigmatic \[]{.mark}and\]
antagonistic'.]{.underline} 26 [This other]{.underline}, Baudrillard
argues, [is continually symbolically repressed in a socio-political
sphere that perpetuates the 'virus of difference']{.underline}. 27
Baudrillard's 'radical other' is always an irreducible singularity.¶
[The production of difference as strategy to attain extinction of the
symbolic reproduction of this other may seem
counter-intuitive]{.underline}, however, **[[this production of
difference promotes a narrative of Progress, which masks the condition
of]{.mark} fatal [sameness that characterizes the general state of
transindifferenc]{.mark}e]{.underline}**; that is, [the state of the
contemporary]{.underline} -- the wake of Simulation, which Sylvère
Lotringer defined as an 'anthropological diagnostic'. 28 Baudrillard
explains this in the following way: '**[[What we]{.mark} ourselves [have
fallen victim to]{.mark} \[...\] is [a virus destructive of
otherness]{.mark} \[...\] [(That is) the symbolic reproduction of the
other, favouring,]{.mark} rather[, a cloned, asexual reproduction of the
species-less individual']{.mark}]{.underline}**. 29 [Sameness is more
troubling to Baudrillard than (his) 'other' of 'illness, death,
negativity, violence (and) strangeness']{.underline}. [**[This
sameness]{.mark}**, born out of a story of difference, **[is the 'other'
that Baudrillard identifies as the 'negotiable other, the other of
difference \[that\] has to be promoted']{.mark}.**]{.underline} 30 It is
this other, [a repeated reproduction in a social of promoted
immunity]{.underline}, towards which Baudrillard is critical.31¶ [[The
terms we are used to setting in opposition to each other are]{.mark}
quite simply [incompatible, which means that the concept of difference
has no meaning]{.mark}']{.underline}. 32 This passage identifies **[[the
superfluity of oppositional difference]{.mark} that [is central to
modernity's 'production of the other']{.mark}]{.underline}**. Good
versus Evil, for example, has the reputation of fundamental opposing
forces yet the relation turns out to be two sides of the same coin.
William Pawlett notes that, for both Bataille and Baudrillard,¶ [**[Evil
must be recognised and affirmed]{.mark}**, [without Evil there can be no
challenge to the]{.mark} social and [political order]{.mark}, no
defiance, no creative renewal and, since Good and Evil are never found
in isolation, without Evil there can be no Good]{.underline}.33¶
Baudrillard's writing suggests that [the production of incompatible
binary opposites sparks a sense of antagonism, which provokes a
superfluous fixation on defensive immunity across all
bodies]{.underline} (physical and political). **[[This
results]{.underline}]{.mark}**, Baudrillard warns, **[[in the
'\[elimination of\] ourselves']{.underline}]{.mark}**. 34 To contrast
this divisive categorical other with Baudrillard's definition of other
underscores that, for him, [an appreciation of oneself always already
implies such internal 'otherness']{.underline}. Such an otherness
complicates a simplistic definition of immunity as defence and
protection. Against whom is one fighting when Baudrillard's other is
always already bound to oneself?¶ [A promotion of divisiveness is
absorbed and incorporated in the culturally constructed idea of immunity
-- a promoted immunity is protection, defence and exemption at all
cost]{.underline}. [Baudrillard exposes and critiques an ideology of
linear Progress or the innate goodness of Progress]{.underline},
understood as division and conquest, by underscoring that **[[such a
system operates in conflict with the world's fundamental condition of
duality/]{.mark}reversibility [wherein 'Good' is always]{.mark} shadowed
and [bound to 'Evil' and vice-versa]{.mark}]{.underline}**. For
Baudrillard, [the idea of Progress that presupposes division is imagined
yet enacted]{.underline}. Baudrillard identifies [immunity as conceived
and performed in cyclical consumption as ideal and repeatedly
internalized]{.underline}. Two areas are explored wherein the question
of immunity arises: that of war and that of the body, both of which
hinge upon the technological and political, albeit in their simulated
state of trans-beyond.

character[, is a modern fact of science]{.underline}. [It [is specific
to our culture. Every other culture says that death begins before death,
that life goes on after life, and that it is impossible to distinguish
life from death]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Against the representation which
sees in one the term of the other, we must try to see the radical
indeterminacy of life and death, and the impossibility of their autonomy
in the symbolic order]{.underline}. [Death]{.underline} is not a due
payment \[échéance\], it [is a nuance of life;]{.underline} or, life is
a nuance of death. But [[our]{.mark} [modern idea of death is controlled
by a very different system of representations]{.mark}]{.underline}: that
of the machine and the function. A machine either works or it does not.
Thus [[the biological machine is either dead or
alive]{.underline}]{.mark}. [The symbolic order is ignorant of this
digital abstraction]{.underline}. And **[[even biology acknowledges that
we start dying at birth]{.mark},]{.underline}** but this remains with
the category of a functional definition. 25 It is quite another thing to
say that [death articulates life]{.underline}, is exchanged with life
and is the apogee of life: for [then it becomes absurd to make life a
process which expires with death, and more absurd still to make death
equivalent to a deficit and, an accelerated repayment]{.underline}.
**[[Neither life nor death can any longer be assigned a given
end]{.mark}:]{.underline}** [[there is]{.underline}]{.mark} therefore
[[no punctuality nor any possible definition of
death]{.underline}]{.mark}. We are living entirely within evolutionist
thought, which states that we go from life to death: this is the
illusion of the subject that sustains both biology and metaphysics
(biology wishes to reverse metaphysics, but merely prolongs it). But
[there is no longer even a subject who dies at a given
moment]{.underline}. It is more real to say that whole parts of
\'ourselves\' (of our bodies, our language) fall from life to death,
while the living are subjected to the work of mourning. In this way, a
few of the living manage to forget them gradually, as God managed to
forget the drowned girl who was carried away by the stream of water in
Brecht\'s song: Und es geschah, dass Gott sie allmählich vergass, zuerst
das Gesicht, dann die Hände, und zuletzt das Haar . . . \[It happened
(very slowly) that it gently slid from God\'s thoughts: First her face,
then her hands, and right at the end her hair.\] \[\'The Drowned Girl\'
in Bertolt Brecht: Poems and Songs, ed and tr. John Willett, London:
Methuen, 1990, p. 14\] [[The subject\'s identity is continually falling
apart]{.underline}]{.mark}, falling into God\'s forgetting. But this
death is not at all biological. At one pole, biochemistry, asexual
protozoa are not affected by death, they divide and branch out (nor is
the genetic code, for its part, ever affected by death: it is
transmitted unchanged beyond individual fates). At the other, symbolic,
pole, death and nothingness no longer exist, since in the symbolic, life
and death are reversible. Only in the infinitesimal space of the
individual conscious subject does death take on an irreversible meaning.
Even here, [**[death is not an event, but a myth experienced as
anticipation]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The subject needs a myth of its
end, as of its origin, to form its identity. [In reality, [the subject
is never there]{.mark}]{.underline}: like the face, the hands and the
hair, and even before no doubt[, [it is always already somewhere
else]{.underline}]{.mark}[, trapped in a senseless distribution, [an
endless cycle impelled by death]{.mark}]{.underline}. This death,
everywhere in life, must be conjured up and localised in a precise point
of time and a precise place: the body. [In biological death, death and
the body neutralise instead of stimulating each other]{.underline}. The
mindbody duality is biology\'s fundamental presupposition. In a certain
sense, [[this duality is death itself, since it objectifies the body as
residual]{.mark}, as a bad object [which takes]{.mark} its [revenge by
dying.]{.mark}]{.underline} It is according to the mind that the body
becomes the brute, objective fact, fated for sex, anguish and death. It
is according to the mind, this imaginary schizz, that [the body becomes
the \'reality\' that exists only in being condemned to
death]{.underline}. Therefore [the mortal body is no more \'real\' than
the immortal soul]{.underline}: both result simultaneously from the same
abstraction, and with them the two great complementary metaphysics: the
idealism of the soul (with all its moral metamorphoses) and the
\'materialist\' idealism of the body, prolonged in biology. Biology
lives on as much by the separation of mind and body as from any other
Christian or Cartesian metaphysics, but it no longer declares this. The
mind or soul is not mentioned any more: as an ideal principle, it has
entirely passed into the moral discipline of science; into the
legitimating principle of technical operations on the real and on the
world; into the principles of an \'objective\' materialism. In the
Middle Ages, those who practised the discourse of the mind or soul were
closer to the \'bodily signs\' (Octavio Paz, Conjunctions and
Disjunctions \[tr. Helen Lane, New York: Arcade, 1990\] ) than
biological science, which, techniques and axioms, has passed entirely
over to the side of the \'non-body\'. The Accident and the Catastrophe
There is a paradox of modern bourgeois rationality concerning death. To
conceive of it as natural, profane and irreversible constitutes the sign
of the \'Enlightenment\' and Reason, but enters into sharp contradiction
with the principles of bourgeois rationality, with its individual
values, the unlimited progress of science, and its mastery of nature in
all things. [Death, neutralised as a \'natural fact\', gradually becomes
a scandal]{.underline}. Octavio Paz has analysed this brilliantly in his
theory of the Accident: [Modern science has eliminated epidemics and has
given us plausible explanations of other natural
catastrophes]{.underline}: [nature has ceased to be the depository of
our guilt feelings; at the same time, technology has extended and
widened the notion of accident and, what is more, it has given it an
absolutely different character. . . . Accidents are part of our daily
life and their shadow peoples our dreams]{.underline}. . . . The
uncertainty principle in contemporary physics and Gödel\'s proof in
logic are the equivalent of the Accident in the historical world. . . .
Axiomatic and deterministic systems have lost their consistency and
revealed an inherent defect. But it is not really a defect: it is a
property of the system, something that belongs to it as a system. The
Accident is not an exception or a sickness of our political regimes; nor
is it a correctable defect of our civilisation: it is the natural
consequence of our science, our politics and our morality. The Accident
is part of our idea of progress. . . . The Accident has become a paradox
of necessity: it possesses the fatality of necessity and at the same
time the uncertainty of freedom. The non-body, transformed into a
materialist science, is a synonym for terror: the Accident is one of the
attributes of reason that we adore. . . . [Christian morality has given
its powers of repression over to it, but at the same time this
superhuman power has lost any pretension to morality]{.underline}. It is
the return of the anguish of the Aztecs, without any celestial signs or
presages. Catastrophe has become banal and laughable because in the
final analysis the Accident is only an accident. (Conjunctions and
Disjunctions, pp. 11113) Just as society gives rise to madmen and
anomalies at its peripheries in the process of normalisation so reason
and the technical mastery of nature, as they become more entrenched,
become surrounded by the catastrophic breakdown of the \'inorganic body
of nature\' they give rise to as unreason. This unreason is intolerable,
since reason wants to be sovereign and can no longer even think of what
escapes it; it is unresolvable since for us there are no longer any
propitiating or reconciling rituals: the accident, like death, is
absurd, that\'s all there is to it. It is a piece of sabotage. An evil
demon is there to make this beautiful machine always break down. Hence
this rationalist culture suffers, like no other, from a collective
paranoia. Something or someone must have been responsible for the least
accident, the slightest irregularity, the least catastrophe, an earth
tremor, a house in ruins, bad weather; everything is an assassination
attempt. Thus the new wave of sabotage, terrorism and banditism is less
interesting than the fact that what happens is interpreted this way.
Accident or not? Undecidable. Nor is it important, since the category of
the Accident analysed by Octavio Paz has fallen under that of the
assassination attempt. And this is normal in a rational system: since
chance can only be left to a human will, every breakdown is interpreted
as a curse, an evil spell, or, politically, as a breach of the social
order. 26 And it is true that a natural catastrophe is a danger to the
established order, not only because of the real disorder it provokes,
but by the blow it strikes to every sovereign \'rationality\', politics
included. Hence the state of siege for the earth tremor (Nicaragua),
hence the police presence at the scenes of catastrophes (which, at the
time of the Ermenonville DC-10 catastrophe, is more important than at a
demonstration). For no-one knows to what extent the [[\'death drive\',
primed by the accident]{.mark} or the catastrophe, [may be
unleashed]{.mark} on this occasion [and turn against the political
order]{.mark}.]{.underline} It is remarkable that we have returned, in
the heyday of the rational system and as a full logical consequence of
this system, to the \'primitive\' vision where we impute a hostile will
to every event, and particularly to death. But it is ourselves and
ourselves alone who are full primitives (which nickname we attach to the
primitives in order to exorcise it). For the \'primitives\' themselves,
this conception corresponded to the logic of their reciprocal and
ambivalent exchanges involving everything around them; even natural
catastrophes and death were easily intelligible through the categories
of their social structures, whereas for us it is plainly paralogical.
This is arational paranoia, the axioms of which give rise to an
increasingly ubiquitous and absolute unintelligibility: death as
unacceptable and insoluble, the Accident as persecution, as the absurd
and spiteful resistance of a matter or a nature that will not abide by
the \'objective\' laws with which we have pursued it. Hence the ever
increasing fascination with the catastrophe, the accident and the
assassination attempt: [reason itself is pursued by the hope of a
universal revolt against its own norms and privileges. **[\'Natural\'
Death]{.mark}** An ideal or standard form of death, \'natural\' death,
corresponds to the biological definition of death and the rational
logical will. This death **[is \'normal\' since it comes \'at life\'s
proper term\']{.mark}**.]{.underline} Its very concept issues from the
possibility of pushing back the limits of life: living becomes a process
of accumulation, and science and technology start to play a role in this
quantitative strategy. [Science and technology do not manage to fulfil
an original desire to live as long as possible]{.underline}; through the
symbolic disintrication of death, life passes into life-capital (into a
quantitative evaluation), which alone gives rise to a biomedical science
and technology of prolonging life. [Natural death therefore signifies
not the acceptance of death within \'the order of things\', but a
systematic denegation of death. Natural death is subject to science, and
death\'s call is to be exterminated by science.]{.underline} This
clearly signifies that **[[death is inhuman, irrational and senseless,
like untamed nature]{.underline}]{.mark}** (the Western concept of
\'nature\' is always the concept of a repressed or domesticated nature).
[[The only good death is a death that has been defeated and subjected to
the law]{.mark}: this is the ideal of natural death. It should be
possible for everyone to reach the term of their biological \'capital\',
to enjoy life \'to the end\' without violence or premature
death.]{.underline} As if everyone had their own little print-out of a
life-plan, their \'normal expectation\' of life, basically a \'contract
of life\'; hence the social demand for a quality of life that makes up
part of a natural death. The new social contract: [society as a whole,
with its science and technology, becomes collectively responsible for
the death of each individual]{.underline}. 27 This demand could moreover
involve calling the existing order into question, as do quantitative
(wage) demands: to demand a just lifespan just as one demands just
rewards for one\'s labour power. Essentially, this right, like every
other, conceals a repressive jurisdiction. [[Everyone has a
right]{.mark}, but also a duty, [to a natural death]{.mark}, [for this
death is characteristic of the system of political economy, its typical
obligation to die]{.mark}:]{.underline} 1. As a system of maximalisation
of the forces of production (in an \'extensive\' system of manpower,
slaves have no natural death, they are made to work themselves to
death); 2. More importantly, that [everyone should have a right to their
life (]{.underline}habeas corpus habeas vitam) extends social
jurisdiction over death[. [Death is socialised]{.underline}]{.mark}
[like everything else, [and can no longer be anything but natural, since
every other death is a]{.mark} social [scandal]{.mark}]{.underline}: we
have not done what is necessary. Is this social progress? No, it is
rather the progress of the social, which even annexes death to itself.
[**[Everyone is dispossessed of their death]{.mark}**, and will no
longer be able to die as it is now understood.]{.underline} One will no
longer be free to live as long as possible. Amongst other things, [this
signifies the ban on consuming one\'s life without taking limits into
account]{.underline}. In short, the principle of natural death is
equivalent to the neutralisation of life. 28 The same goes for the
question of equality in death[: [life must be reduced to
quantity]{.underline}]{.mark} [(and death therefore to nothing) in order
[to adjust it to democracy and the law of
equivalences]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### Capitalism uses death as a tool to leverage other its subjects.

**Baudrillard 76 (Jean, alternate universe Brett Bricker, *Symbolic
Exchange and Death*, pp. 39-43)**

Labour power is instituted on death. [[A man must die to become labour
power. He converts]{.mark} this [death into a wage]{.mark}]{.underline}.
But the economic violence capital inflicted on him in the equivalence of
the wage and labour power is nothing next to the symbolic violence
inflicted on him by his definition as a productive force. Faking this
equivalence is nothing next to the equivalence, qua signs, of wages and
death. [The very possibility of [quantitative equivalence presupposes
death]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The equivalence of wages [and]{.mark}
labour power presupposes [the death of the worker]{.mark}]{.underline},
while that of any commodity and any other presupposes the symbolic
extermination of objects. [Death makes the calculation of equivalence,
and regulation by indifference, possible in general]{.underline}. [[This
death is not violent]{.mark} and physical[, it is the indifferent
consumption of life and death, **the mutual neutralisation of life and
death in sur-vival**]{.mark}**, or death deferred**]{.underline}.
[[Labour is slow death]{.underline}]{.mark}. This is generally
understood in the sense of physical exhaustion. But it must be
understood in another sense. Labour is not opposed, like a sort of
death, to the \'fulfilment of life\', which is the idealist view;
[labour is opposed as a slow death to a violent death]{.underline}. That
is the symbolic reality. [[Labour is opposed as deferred death
to]{.mark} the [immediate death]{.mark} of sacrifice]{.underline}.
Against every pious and \'revolutionary\' view of the \'labour (or
culture) is the opposite of life\' type, we must maintain that [[the
only alternative to labour]{.mark} is not free time, or non-labour, it
[is sacrifice]{.mark}]{.underline}. All this becomes clear in the
genealogy of the slave. First, the prisoner of war is purely and simply
put to death (one does him an honour in this way). Then he is \'spared\'
\[épargné\] and conserved \[conservé\] (=servus), under the category of
spoils of war and a prestige good: he becomes a slave and passes into
sumptuary domesticity. It is only later that he passes into servile
labour. However, he is no longer a \'labourer\', since labour only
appears in the phase of the serf or the emancipated slave, finally
relieved of the mortgage of being put to death. Why is he freed?
Precisely in order to work. [[Labour]{.mark} therefore everywhere draws
its inspiration from deferred death]{.underline}. [It [comes from
deferred death]{.mark}]{.underline}. Slow or violent, immediate or
deferred, **[[the scansion of death is decisive]{.mark}: [it]{.mark} is
what radically [distinguishes]{.mark} two types of organisation, [the
economic and the sacrificial]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [We live
irreversibly in the first of these, which has inexorably taken root in
the différance of death]{.underline}. The scenario has never changed.
[Whoever works has not been put to death, he is refused this
honour]{.underline}. And [[labour is]{.mark} first of all [the]{.mark}
[sign of being judged worthy only of life]{.mark}]{.underline}. Does
capital exploit the workers to death? Paradoxically, **[[the worst it
inflicts on them is refusing them death]{.underline}]{.mark}**. It is
**[[by deferring their death that they are made into slaves and
condemned to]{.mark} the indefinite abjection of [a life of
labour]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [The substance of labour and exploitation
is indifferent in this symbolic relation]{.underline}. **[[The power of
the master always primarily derives from this suspension of
death]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Power is therefore never, contrary to what
we might imagine, the power of putting to death, but exactly the
opposite, that of allowing to live a life that the slave lacks the power
to give. [The master confiscates the death of the other while retaining
the right to risk his own]{.underline}. [The slave is refused this, and
is condemned to a life without return, and therefore without possible
expiation]{.underline}. [By removing death, the master removes the slave
from the circulation of symbolic goods]{.underline}. This is the
violence the master does to the slave, condemning him to labour power.
There lies the secret of power (in the dialectic of the master and the
slave, Hegel also derives the domination of the master from the deferred
threat of death hanging over the slave). [[Labour, production and
exploitation would]{.mark} only [be one of the possible avatars of this
power structure, which is a structure of death]{.mark}]{.underline}.
This changes every revolutionary perspective on the abolition of power.
[If power is death deferred, it will not be removed insofar as the
suspension of this death will not be removed]{.underline}. And if power,
of which this is always and everywhere the definition, resides in the
act of giving without being given, it is clear that **[[the power the
master has to unilaterally grant life will only be abolished if this
life can be given to him in a non-deferred death]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
[**[There is no other alternative; you will never abolish this power by
staying alive]{.mark}**, since there will have been no reversal of what
has been given]{.underline}. Only [the surrender of this life,
retaliating against a deferred death with an immediate death,
constitutes a radical response, and the only possibility of abolishing
power]{.underline}. No revolutionary strategy can begin without the
slave putting his own death back at stake, since this is what the master
puts off in the différance from which he profits by securing his power.
Refuse to be put to death, refuse to live in the mortal reprieve of
power, refuse the duty of this life and never be quits with living, in
effect be under obligation to settle this long-term credit through the
slow death of labour, since [this slow death does not alter the future
of this abject dimension, in the fatality of power]{.underline}.
[**[Violent death changes everything, slow death changes
nothing]{.underline}**,]{.mark} for [[there is a rhythm, a scansion
necessary to symbolic exchange:]{.mark} something has to be given in the
same movement and following the same rhythm, otherwise there is no
reciprocity and it is quite simply not given]{.underline}. The strategy
of the system of power is to displace the time of the exchange,
substituting continuity and mortal linearity for the immediate
retaliation of death[. [It is]{.underline}]{.mark} [thus [futile for the
slave]{.mark} (the worker) [to give little by little]{.mark}, in
infinitesimal doses, [to the rope of labour on which he is hung to
death]{.mark}]{.underline}, to give his life to the master or to
capital, for this \'sacrifice\' in small doses is no longer a sacrifice
it doesn\'t touch the most important thing, the différance of death, and
merely distils a process whose structure remains the same. We could in
fact advance the hypothesis that in labour the exploited renders his
life to the exploiter and thereby regains, by means of this very
exploitation, a power of symbolic response. There was counter-power in
the labour process as the exploited put their own (slow) death at stake.
Here we agree with Lyotard\'s hypothesis on the level of libidinal
economics: [the intensity of the exploited\'s enjoyment \[jouissance\]
in their very abjection]{.underline}. And Lyotard is right.
**[[Libidinal intensity, the charge of desire and the surrendering of
death are always there in the exploited]{.underline}]{.mark}**, 26 [but
no longer on the properly symbolic rhythm of the immediate retaliation,
and therefore total resolution]{.underline}. [**[The enjoyment of
powerlessness]{.mark}** (on sole condition that this is not a phantasy
aimed at reinstating the triumph of desire at the level of the
proletariat[) will never abolish power]{.mark}]{.underline}. The very
modality of the response to the slow death of labour leaves [[the
master]{.underline}]{.mark} the possibility of, once again,
[repeatedly[, giving the slave life through labour]{.mark}]{.underline}.
The accounts are never settled, it always profits power, the dialectic
of power which plays on the splitting of the poles of death, the poles
of exchange. [The slave remains the prisoner of the master\'s dialectic,
while his death, or his distilled life, serves the indefinite repetition
of domination]{.underline}. This domination increases as the system is
charged with neutralising the symbolic retaliation by buying it back
through wages. If, through labour, the exploited attempts to give his
life to the exploiter, the latter wards off this restitution by means of
wages. Here again we must take a symbolic radiograph. Contrary to all
appearances and experience (capital buys its labour power from the
worker and extorts surplus labour), [capital gives labour to the worker
(and the worker himself gives capital to the capitalist)]{.underline}.
In German this is Arbeitgeber: the entrepreneur is a \'provider of
labour\'; and Arbeitnehmer: **[[it is the capitalist who gives, who has
the initiative of the gift, which secures him, as in every social order,
a pre-eminence and a power far beyond the
economic]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [The refusal of labour, in its radical
form, is the refusal of this symbolic domination and the humiliation of
being bestowed upon]{.underline}. The gift and the taking of labour
function directly as the code of the dominant social relation, as the
code of discrimination. Wages are the mark of this poisonous gift, the
sign which epitomises the whole code. They sanction this unilateral gift
of labour, or rather wages symbolically buy back the domination
exercised by capital through the gift of labour. At the same time, they
furnish capital with the possibility of confining the operation to a
contractual dimension, thus stabilising confrontation on economic
ground. Furthermore, wages turn the wage-earner into a \'consumer of
goods\', reiterating his status as a \'consumer of labour\' and
reinforcing his symbolic deficit. To refuse labour, to dispute wages is
thus to put the process of the gift, expiation and economic compensation
back into question, and therefore to expose the fundamental symbolic
process. Wages are no longer \'grabbed\' today. You too are given a
wage, not in exchange for labour, but so that you spend it, which is
itself another kind of labour. In the consumption or use of objects, the
wage-consumer finds herself reproducing exactly the same symbolic
relation of slow death as she undergoes in labour. [The user experiences
exactly the same deferred death in the object (she does not sacrifice
it, she \'uses\' it and \'uses\' it functionally) as the worker does in
capital]{.underline}. And just as wages buy back this unilateral gift of
labour, [the price paid for the object is only the user buying back the
object\'s deferred death]{.underline}. The proof of this lies in the
symbolic rule which states that what falls to you without charge
(lotteries, presents, gambling wins) must not be devoted to use, but
spent as pure loss. [Every domination must be bought back, redeemed.
This was formerly done through sacrificial death (the ritual death of
the king or the leader), or even by ritual inversion (feasts and other
social rites: but these are still forms of sacrifice)]{.underline}.
[This social game of reversal comes to an end with the dialectic of the
master and the slave, where **[the reversibility of power cedes its
place to a dialectic of the reproduction of
power]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The redemption of power must always,
however, be simulated, and this is done by the apparatus of capital
where formal redemption takes place throughout the immense machine of
labour, wages and consumption. [[Economics is the sphere]{.mark} of
redemption par excellence, [where the domination of capital manages to
redeem itself without ever]{.mark} really [putting itself at
stake]{.mark}]{.underline}. On the contrary, [[it diverts the process of
redemption into its own infinite reproduction]{.underline}]{.mark}. This
is perhaps where we find the necessity of economics and its historical
appearance, at the level of societies so much more vast and mobile than
primitive groups, where the urgency of a system of redemption which
could be measured, controlled and infinitely extended (which rituals
cannot be) all at the same time, and which above all would not put the
exercise and heredity of power back into question. Production and
consumption are an original and unprecedented solution to this problem.
By simulating redemption in this new form, [the slide from the symbolic
into the economic allows the definitive hegemony of political force over
society to be secured]{.underline}. Economics miraculously succeeds in
masking the real structure of power by reversing the terms of its
definition. [While power consists in unilateral giving (of life in
particular, see above), a contrary interpretation has been successfully
imposed: power would consist in a unilateral taking and
appropriation]{.underline}. Under cover of this ingenious retraction,
real symbolic domination can continue to do as it will, since **[[all
the efforts of those under this domination will rush into the trap of
taking]{.mark} back from power what it has taken from them[, even
\'taking power\' themselves, thus blindly pushing on along the lines of
their domination]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In fact, labour, wages, power
and revolution must all be read against the grain: labour is not
exploitation, it is given by capital; wages are not grabbed, capital
gives them too it does not buy a labour power, it buys back the power of
capital; 27 [the slow death of labour is not endured, it is a desperate
attempt, a challenge to capital\'s unilateral gift of
labour]{.underline}; **[[the only]{.mark} effective [reply to power is
to give it back what it gives you]{.mark}, and this is only symbolically
possible [by means of death]{.mark}]{.underline}**. However, if, as we
have seen, the system itself deposes economics, removes its substance
and its credibility, then, in this perspective, doesn\'t it put its own
symbolic domination back into question? No, since the system brings
about the overall reign of its power strategy, the gift without
counter-gift, which becomes fused with deferred death. The same social
relations are set up in the media and in consumption, where we have seen
(\'Requiem pour les Media\' \[Utopie, 4, 1971\]) that there is no
possible response or counter-gift to the unilateral delivery of
messages. We were able to interpret. (CERFI\'s project concerning
automobile accidents) auto-slaughter as the price that the collective
pays to its institutions . . . : [the State\'s gifts inscribe a \'debt\'
in the collective accounts book]{.underline}. **[[Gratuitous death is
then merely an attempt to absorb this deficit]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
The blood on the roads is a desperate form \'of compensation for the
State\'s tarmac gifts. [The accident thus takes its place in the space
that institutes a symbolic debt towards the State]{.underline}. It is
likely that the more this debt grows, the more marked will be the
tendency towards the accident. Every \'rational\' strategy for curbing
this phenomenon (prevention, speed limits, rescue services, repression)
is effectively negligible. They simulate the possibility of integrating
the accident into a rational system, and are therefore incapable of
grasping the root of the problem: [balancing a symbolic debt which
founds, legitimates and reinforces the collective dependency on the
State]{.underline}. On the contrary, these \'rational\' strategies
accentuate the phenomenon. In order to avert the effects of accidents,
[they propose to institute more mechanisms, more state institutions,
supplementary \'gifts\', which are simply means of aggravating the
symbolic debt]{.underline}. In this way the struggle is everywhere
opposed to a political authority (cf. Pierre Clastres, Society against
**[[the State]{.underline}]{.mark}** \[tr. R. Hurley and A. Stein, New
York: Zone Books, 1990\]), **[[which sets all the power it can draw from
its showers of gifts the survival it maintains and the death it
withdraws above the struggle in order to stockpile and then distil it
for its own ends]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Nobody really accepts this
bonus forever, you give what you can, 28 but [power always gives more so
as to serve better, and **[an entire society]{.mark} or a few
individuals [can go to great lengths, even their own destruction, to put
an end to it]{.mark}**]{.underline}[. **[This is the only absolute
weapon, and the mere collective threat of it can make power
collapse]{.underline}**]{.mark}. [Power, faced with this symbolic
\'blackmail\']{.underline} (the barricades of \'68, hostage-taking),
[loses its footing:]{.underline} **[[since it thrives on my slow death,
I will oppose it with my violent death]{.underline}]{.mark}**. And it is
[[because we are living with slow death that we dream of a violent
death]{.mark}. Even this dream is unbearable to power]{.underline}.

#### The desire to abolish death clouds political decision making.

**Baudrillard 76 (Jean, the hyperreal slim shady, *Symbolic Exchange and
Death*, pp. 146-148) //**

With the disintegration of traditional Christian and feudal communities
through bourgeois Reason and the nascent system of political economy,
**[[death is no longer divided]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[It is cast in
the image of the material goods which]{.mark}, as in previous exchanges,
[begin to circulate less between inseparable
partner]{.mark}]{.underline}[s]{.mark} (it is always more or less a
community or a clan who exchange), [[and increasingly under the sign of
a general equivalent]{.underline}]{.mark}. In the capitalist mode,
everyone is alone before the general equivalent. It is no coincidence
that, in the same way, [[everyone finds themselves alone before death,
since **death is general equivalence**]{.underline}]{.mark}. From this
point on [the obsession with death and [the will to abolish death
through accumulation become the fundamental motor of the rationality of
political economy]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}
[[Value]{.underline}]{.mark}, in particular time as value, [[is
accumulated in the phantasm of death]{.mark} deferred, pending the term
of a linear infinity of value.]{.underline} Even those who no longer
believe in a personal eternity believe in the infinity of time as they
do in a species-capital of double-compound interests. [[The infinity of
capital passes into the infinity of time, the eternity of a productive
system no longer familiar with the reversibility of gift-exchange, but
instead with the irreversibility of quantitative
growth]{.underline}]{.mark}. The accumulation of time imposes the idea
of progress, as the accumulation of science imposes the idea of truth:
in each case, what is accumulated is no longer symbolically exchanged,
but becomes an objective dimension. Ultimately[[, the total objectivity
of time, like total accumulation, is the total impossibility of symbolic
exchange, that is, death]{.underline}]{.mark}. Hence the absolute
impasse of [[political economy]{.mark},]{.underline} which [[intends to
eliminate death through accumulation: **the time of accumulation is the
time of death itself**]{.underline}]{.mark}. We cannot hope for a
dialectical revolution at the end of this process of spiralling
hoarding. We already know that the economic rationalisation of exchange
(the market) is the social form which produces scarcity (Marshall
Sahlins, \'The original affluent society\', in Stone Age Economics
\[Chicago: Aldine and Atherton, 1972\]). Similarly, [the infinite
accumulation of time as value under the sign of general equivalence
entails the absolute scarcity of time that is death]{.underline}. A
contradiction in capitalism? No, communism in this instance is in
solidarity with political economy, since, in accordance with the same
fantastic schema of an eternal accumulation of productive forces,
communism too aims for the abolition of death. Only its total ignorance
of death (save perhaps as a hostile horizon to be conquered by science
and technics) has protected it up to now from the worst contradictions.
For [nothing can will the abolition of the law of value if you want to
abolish death, that is, to preserve life as absolute value, at the same
time. Life itself must leave the law of value and achieve a successful
exchange against death]{.underline}. The materialists, with their
idealistic life expurgated of death, a life \'free\' at last of all
ambivalence, hardly trouble themselves with this. 21 [Our whole culture
is just one huge effort to dissociate life and death, to ward off the
ambivalence of death in the interests of life as value, and time as the
general equivalent. The elimination of death is our
phantasm]{.underline}, and ramifies in every direction: for religion,
the afterlife and immortality; for science, truth; and for economics,
productivity and accumulation. [No other culture had this distinctive
opposition of life and death in the interests of life as
positivity:]{.underline} [life as accumulation, death as due
payment]{.underline}. No other culture had this impasse: as soon as the
ambivalence of life and death and the symbolic reversibility of death
comes to an end, we enter into a process of accumulation of life as
value; but by the same token, we also enter the field of the equivalent
production of death. So life-become-value is constantly perverted by the
equivalent death. [[Death]{.underline}]{.mark}, at the same instant[,
[becomes the object of a perverse desire. Desire invests the very
separation of life and death. This is the only way that we can speak of
a death-drive]{.underline}]{.mark}. This is the only way we can speak of
the unconscious, for the unconscious is only the accumulation of
equivalent death, the [death that is no longer exchanged]{.underline}
and can only be cashed out in the phantasm. The symbolic is the inverse
dream of an end of accumulation and a possible reversibility of death in
exchange. [[Symbolic death]{.underline}]{.mark}, [which [has not
undergone the imaginary disjunction of life and death]{.mark} which is
at the origin of the reality of death, is exchanged in a social ritual
of feasting]{.underline}. Imaginary-real death (our own) can only be
redeemed through the individual work of mourning, which the subject
carries out over the death of others and over himself from the start of
his own life. This work of mourning has fuelled Western metaphysics of
death since Christianity, even in the metaphysical concept of the death
drive.

### Emerging Tech

#### The integration of emerging technology into the human body homogenizes the human subject. 

**Baudrillard** **90** (Jean, French sociologist, philosopher and
cultural theorist, "*The Transparency of Evil,*" Xerox and Infinity,
1990, 6/24/22 - FI)

[**[Am I a man or a machine]{.mark}**?]{.underline} This anthropological
[[question no longer has an answer]{.underline}]{.mark}. We are thus in
some sense [witness to [the end of anthropology, now being conjured away
by the most recent]{.mark} machines and
[technologies]{.mark}.]{.underline} The uncertainty here is born of the
perfecting of machine networks, just as sexual uncertainty (Am I a man
or a woman? What has the difference between the sexes become?) is born
of increasingly sophisticated manipulation of the unconscious and of the
body, and just as science\'s uncertainty about the status of its object
is born of the sophistication of analysis in the microsciences. Am I a
man or a machine? There is no ambiguity in the traditional relationship
between man and machine: the worker is always, in a way, a stranger to
the machine he operates, and alienated by it. But at least he retains
the precious status of alienated man. The [[new
tech]{.mark}nologies]{.underline}, with their new machines, new images
and interactive screens, do not alienate me. Rather, they [[form an
integrated circuit with me. Video screens, televisions, computers and
Minitels resemble]{.mark} nothing so much as [contact lenses in that
they are so many transparent prostheses]{.mark}, [**integrated into the
body** to the point of being]{.mark} almost [part of its genetic
make-up]{.mark}: they are [like]{.mark} [pacemakers - or]{.mark} like
Philip K. Dick\'s [\'papula\']{.mark}, a [tiny implant, grafted onto the
body]{.mark} at birth as a \'free gift\', [which serves the organism as
an alarm signal]{.mark}. [All our relationships with networks and
screens]{.mark},]{.underline} whether willed or not, [[are of
this]{.underline}]{.mark} order. Their structure is one of
subordination, not of alienation - the structure of the **[[integrated
circuit.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Man or machine? Impossible to tell.
Surely the extraordinary [**[success of a]{.mark}rtificial
[i]{.mark}ntelligence** is]{.underline} [[attributable to the
fact]{.mark} that [it **frees us from real
intelligence**]{.mark},]{.underline} that by hypertrophying thought [as
an operational process [it **frees us from thought\'s
ambiguity**]{.mark} and from the insoluble puzzle of its relationship to
the world]{.underline}. Surely [the success of all these technologies is
a result of the way in which they make it impossible even to raise the
timeless question of liberty.]{.underline} What a relief! Thanks to the
machinery of the virtual, all your problems are over! [[You are **no
longer either subject or object**]{.mark},]{.underline} no longer either
free or alienated - and no longer either one or the other: [you are the
same, and enraptured by the commutations of that sameness.]{.underline}
We have left the hell of other people for the ecstasy of the same, the
purgatory of otherness for the artificial paradises of identity. Some
might call this an even worse servitude, but Telecomputer Man, having no
will of his own, knows nothing of serfdom. [Alienation of man by man is
a thing of the past: [now man is plunged into homeostasis by
machines.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### The use of emerging technology to enhance the human body only makes it weaker -- like the dependent boy in the bubble, we die once we touch the outside. 

**Baudrillard** **90** (Jean, French sociologist, philosopher and
cultural theorist, "*The Transparency of Evil,*" Xerox and Infinity,
1990, 6/24/22 - FI)

The [[growing cerebrality of machines must]{.mark} logically [be
expected to occasion a technological purification of
bodies.]{.mark}]{.underline} Inasmuch as bodies are less and less able
to count on their own antibodies, they are more and more in need of
protection from outside. [[An artificial sterilization of]{.mark} all
[environments must compensate for faltering internal]{.mark}
immunological [defences]{.mark}.]{.underline} And if these are indeed
faltering, it is because the irreversible process often referred to as
[[progress]{.mark} tends to [strip the]{.mark} human [body and mind of
their systems of initiative and defence]{.mark}, [reassigning these
functions to]{.mark} [technical artifacts]{.mark}. [Once
dispossessed]{.mark} of their defences, [human beings become]{.mark}
eminently [vulnerable to science and tech]{.mark}nology]{.underline};
dispossessed of their passions, they likewise become eminently
vulnerable to psychology and its attendant therapies; similarly, too,
once relieved of emotions and illnesses, they become eminently
vulnerable to medicine. [[Consider the \'Boy in the
Bubble\']{.mark},]{.underline} [surrounded, in his NASA-donated
tent]{.underline}, by an atmospheric distillate of medical [knowledge,
[protected from any]{.mark} conceivable [infection by an artificial
immune system]{.mark}, [\'cuddled\' by his mother through]{.mark} the
[glass]{.mark}]{.underline}, laughing and growing up in an
extraterrestrial ambiance under the vigilant eye of science. Here we
have the experimental version of the wolf-child, the \'wild child\'
raised by wolves. The parenting in this case, however, is done by
computers. The Boy in the Bubble is a prefigurement of the future - of
that total asepsis, that total extirpation of germs, which is the
biological form of transparency. [[He epitomizes the]{.mark} kind of
[vacuum-sealed existence]{.mark}]{.underline} hitherto reserved for
bacteria and particles in laboratories but now [[destined for us]{.mark}
as]{.underline}, more and more, we are vacuum-pressed like records,
vacuum-packed like deep-frozen foods and vacuum-enclosed for death as
victims of fanatical therapeutic measures. That [[we think and reflect
in a vacuum is demonstrated by the ubiquitousness of a]{.mark}rtificial
[i]{.mark}ntelligence.]{.underline} It is [not absurd to suppose that
the [extermination of man begins with the extermination of man\'s
germs.]{.mark}]{.underline} One has only to consider the human being
himself, complete with his emotions, his passions, his laughter, his sex
and his secretions, to conclude that man is nothing but a dirty little
germ - an irrational virus marring a universe of transparency. [[Once he
has been purged,]{.mark} once everything has been [cleaned up and all
infection]{.mark} - whether of a [social or]{.mark} a [bacillary]{.mark}
kind - [has been driven out, then only the virus of sadness will remain
in a mortally clean and]{.mark} mortally [sophisticated
world.]{.mark}]{.underline} Thought, itself a sort of network of
antibodies and [[natural immune defences]{.underline}]{.mark}, is also
highly vulnerable. [It [is in acute danger of being]{.mark} conveniently
[replaced by an electronic cerebrospinal bubble]{.mark}]{.underline}
from which any animal or metaphysical reflex has been expunged. [Even
without all the technological advantages of the Boy in the Bubble, [we
are already living in the bubble]{.mark} ourselves]{.underline} -
already, like those characters in Bosch paintings, enclosed in a crystal
sphere: a transparent envelope in which we have taken refuge and where
we remain, bereft of everything yet overprotected, [doomed to artificial
immunity, continual transfusions and, [at the slightest contact with the
world outside, instant death.]{.mark}]{.underline} This is why we are
all losing our defences - why we are all potentially immunodeficient.
[[All integrated and hyperintegrated systems]{.mark} - the
[technological system, the social system, even thought]{.mark} itself
[in a]{.mark}rtificial [i]{.mark}ntelligence and its derivatives -
[tend]{.mark} [towards the extreme constituted by
immunodeficiency]{.mark}. [Seeking to eliminate all external
aggression]{.mark}, they secrete their own internal virulence, [their
own malignant reversibilit]{.mark}y.]{.underline} When a certain
saturation point is reached, such systems effect this reversal and
undergo this alteration willy-nilly - and thus tend to self-destruct.
Their very transparency becomes a threat to them, and the crystal has
its revenge. [In a hyperprotected space the body loses all its
defences]{.underline}. So sterile are operating rooms that no germ or
bacterium can survive there. Yet this is the very place where
mysterious, anomalous viral diseases make their appearance. The fact is
that viruses proliferate as soon as they find a free space. A world
purged of the old forms of infection, a world \'ideal\' from the
clinical point of view, offers a perfect field of operations for the
impalpable and implacable pathology which arises from the sterilization
itself. This is a third-level pathology. Just as our societies are
confronting a new kind of violence, born of the paradoxical fact that
they are simultaneously both permissive and pacified, so too we face new
illnesses, those illnesses which beset bodies overprotected by their
artificial, medical or computer-generated shield. [[This pathology is
produced not by accident]{.mark}, nor by anomie, [but]{.mark} rather by
[anomaly]{.mark}]{.underline}. The very [[same thing happens with the
social]{.mark} body,]{.underline} where the same causes bring about the
same perverse effects, the same unforeseeable dysfunctions - [a
situation [comparable to the genetic disorder that occurs at the
cellular level,]{.mark} again [occasioned by overprotection, overcoding,
overmanagement.]{.mark} [The social system, just like the
biological]{.mark} body, [loses its natural defences in precise
proportion to the growing sophistication of its
prostheses]{.mark}.]{.underline} Moreover, [this unprecedented pathology
is unlikely to be effectively conjured away by medicine, because
medicine is itself part of the system of overprotection]{.underline},
and contributes to the fanatical protective and preventive measures
lavished upon the body. Just as there seems to be no political solution
to the problem of terrorism, so there seems to be no biological solution
at present to the problems of AIDS and cancer. Indeed, the causes are
identical: a[nomalous symptoms generated at the most fundamental level
by the system itself represent a reactive virulence designed to counter,
in the first case, a political overmanagement of the social body, and in
the second case, a biological overmanagement of the body tout
court.]{.underline}

#### The human is wiped away in the manipulation and application of emerging technology, and destroyed along with it: ethics, morality, and symbolic rules.

**Baudrillard 92** (Jean, French sociologist, philosopher and cultural
theorist, "*The Illusion of the End,*" Immortality, 1992, 6/25/22 - FI)

The original, Enlightenment humanism was based on man\'s qualities, his
virtues, his natural gifts, his essence, together with his right to
freedom and to the exercise of that freedom. Current
[[humanism]{.underline}]{.mark}, which finds its highest expression in
the new extension of human rights, [is more [concerned with the
conservation of the individual]{.mark} and of man [as a
species]{.mark}]{.underline} (in the one case, immortality is a virtue;
in the other, it is merely a right to conservation). But human rights
immediately become problematic, since the [question arises of the
potential rights of other species, of nature, etc]{.underline}., in
respect of which they have tb be defined. Now, does humanity even have
rights over its own genome? [[What does it mean for a species to have
the right to its own genetic definition]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} thus to
its potential [genetic transformation]{.mark}?]{.underline} We share 98
per cent of our genes with the apes, 90 per cent with mice. What rights
attach to this common heritage? On the other hand, it seems that 90 per
cent of the human genome is of no account. Are we going to claim this
obscure part which has no apparent purpose? [[As soon as the hum**an is
no longer defined in terms of freedom and transcendence but in terms of
genes**, the **definition of**]{.mark} man \[**[humans]{.mark}**\] - and
hence, also, that of humanism - **[is wiped away]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
The [[**demarcation line** of the human]{.mark} [becomes increasingly
**elusive**]{.mark} as we press on [in]{.mark}to [the]{.mark}
[biological realm]{.mark},]{.underline} into the molecular arcana of the
biosphere. While Western humanism has felt threatened since the
sixteenth century by other cultures bursting in upon it, the bolt
currently giving way is no longer merely that of a culture, but of a
species. [Anthropological deregulation. And [a]{.mark} simultaneous
[**deregulation of ethics, of all the moral, juridical, symbolic rules
which were those of humanism**.]{.mark} The [virtual transcendence
of]{.mark} man \[[humans]{.mark}\], as [distinct from]{.mark} his
\[[their\] mortal body]{.mark}, [evaporates with the advance of genetic
engineering]{.mark}.]{.underline} Determination (or rather
[[indeterminacy]{.underline}) [becomes immanent in the **mapping of the
genome, and its manipulation**]{.underline}]{.mark}**[.]{.underline}**
[[Can we]{.mark} still [speak of souls and consciousness in referring to
the automata, chimeras and clones we envisage carrying on the human
species? Can we]{.mark} even [speak of the unconscious]{.mark}, given
the prospect of man \[humans\] coming to be defined
genetically?]{.underline} Even the immortality of the unconscious, so
dear to Freud, is seriously under threat. Not only the individual,
ontogenetic capital, but the [[phylogenetic capital of the species is
threatened by the **evaporation of the limits of the
human**]{.mark}**,**]{.underline} which is no longer an evaporation into
the divine, but into the inhuman and, indeed, not even into the inhuman
but [[into something falling short]{.mark} both [of the human and the
inhuman - the genetic simulation of living beings.]{.mark}]{.underline}
The gods, the soul and immortality, all those things which have been
termed superstitions or fetishism, were still a spiritual, metaphorical
extrapolation of man\'s faculties, including the body as a metaphor of
resurrection. They were, admittedly, artifacts, but immaterial ones, and
ones which retained a projective force, along with the power and play of
illusion. Whereas, with biology and genetics, we are in pure
materiality, in the material simulation of objectively immortal beings,
since they are made up of nuclear elements and a timeless genetic code.
The artificiality is no longer that of a deferred end, but of a
prosthesis - a literal fetishism, in the sense that it is the fetishism
of the literalness of the same and its reproduction. [We are [no longer
dealing with an imaginary prosthesis,]{.mark} with the superstition of a
supra-temporal soul, [but with a material prosthesis]{.mark} - a
[simulation much more destructive than the illusion of the
soul.]{.mark}]{.underline} Moreover, [[the]{.mark} very **[illusion
of]{.mark} the [body]{.mark},** the play of appearances of the body, [is
**destroyed in the simulation** of the functions of life;]{.mark}
[appearances are volatilized by genetic transcription]{.mark}. Another
vital illusion disappears: that of **[thought]{.mark}**, [which is
**abolished**]{.mark} in the instrumentalization of mental faculties,
[in the fetishism of **a**]{.mark}**rtificial
[i]{.mark}ntelligence.**]{.underline}

### Environment 

#### Concern with the "scientific truth" of environmental destruction colludes with the project of transparent communication that seeks to map a humanist reality upon the enigma of the natural world -- this produces environmental crises as the Human constructs itself as master of the biosphere. 

**Hoofd, 12** \[Ingrid, Professor in the Communications at the National
University of Singapore, "*The Climate Change Issue: Beyond the 'True'
or 'Not True',*" //\]

This paper argues that [the **current division** within the scientific
and popular debate into '**for'** or '**against'** the **truth** or
**reality** of anthropogenic climate change silences more
**comprehensive analyses** of the problems **facing
humanity**]{.underline} today. It suggests that [[climate change
**activism**, as well as the **scientific evidence** for anthropogenic
climate change]{.mark}, in their opposition to climate change denialism,
[are]{.mark} the [**paroxysmal outgrowths** of]{.mark}]{.underline} what
the paper identifies as [[the **techno-capitalist acceleration** of the
**humanist aporia**.]{.underline}]{.mark} The paper also argues that [as
[an outflow of the **humanist fantasy** of the **mastery** of **nature**
through **technological** and **economic production**, **climate
science** and **activism** are]{.mark} in many ways the **hypermodern**
or [**simulated** enactments of]{.mark}]{.underline} earlier [1990s
environmentalist [activism]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is due to the fact
[[that]{.mark} this enactment [run]{.mark}s [through the **ambiguous
reproduction**]{.mark} and **recuperation** [of an **idealized
'nature**,' which]{.mark} conceptualization itself [is already a product
of the **capitalist-humanist** social order]{.mark}. The division
between the **truth** and **falsehood** of anthropogenic climate change
is]{.underline} then [a **false opposition** in that it remains
**complicit** in the **humanist** and **productivist**
**techno-scientific ordering** of the world [in which the human is
supposedly the **central actor** or
**produce**]{.mark}**r**.]{.underline} What is more, [[the **incessant
jumbling** over one another of this debate i]{.mark}n the **media** [is
a **simulation** of climate politics]{.mark} insofar this debate itself
becomes an ingredient for **economic acceleration**.]{.underline} This
also means that this paper and its delivery constitute an instant of
this economy's deconstruction in climate change science and activism,
because this paper is compelled to take the side of the veracity of
climate change so as to point to the limits of this
productivist-humanist economy, while simultaneously being fully
implicated in this economy. [Since the current activism and debate on
the environment **fails** to **deepen its critique** sufficiently in
light of the **exponentially raised stakes** under **economic
techno-acceleration**, a more **radical critique** of the **climate
conundrum** must]{.underline} also [generate an **alternative reading**
of climate change as a quintessentially **politicotechnological
apparition**.]{.underline} Note though that calling climate change an
'apparition' does not imply that the occurrence of climate change is
simply false. Rather, I suggest that the accusations hurled at those who
are even modestly sceptical of climate change by immediately branding
such sceptics as immoral right-wing capitalists, are missing a central
point: namely that many such sceptics are fellow travellers in the
larger critique of modern science and technology that climate activists
just as much seek to mount. [Since at issue is then the **truth of
science** and its method of **empiricist validation** through modern
technologies, [a more **radical analysis** should reconsider the very
division between **reality** and **representation**, if only because
**technological acceleration** has made]{.mark} the representation of
[science]{.mark} (in the media]{.underline}, for instance) [[into the
**dominant reality**]{.mark}.]{.underline} This complication of the
division between reality and representation hence suggests that [if
climate change exists, then [climate change is]{.mark} actually [a
**simulation** that]{.mark} **dissimulates** or [**obscures** another
more **urgent catastrophe**]{.mark} or problem.]{.underline} This in
turn might mean that [popular [climate change activism]{.mark} and
thought [is implicated in its mobilization for the **productivist
neoliberal order** due to the present-day **enmeshment** of
**simulation** and **acceleration** by way of **modern
technologies**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Paradoxically then, this paper must
start from the premise that the occurrence of anthropogenic climate
change is true, as this would be the responsible and productive
position; but it also acknowledges that responsibilities are always
constituted in historical and socio-economical imperatives like the
humanistic and economistic ones. To overlay the duty of humanism [to
critique]{.underline} its own duty with [the way responsible climate
**science** and **activism** finds its **limitations** in the
**truth-value** of the **scientific** and **activist** climate change
model is then **crucial** in terms of understanding how a **truly
radical alternative** may emerge from [the **ambiguous ethics** of
**accelerated humanism**]{.mark}.]{.underline} This paper's performance
of [this moral imperative]{.underline} hence [[points to the **sheer
force** of **neoliberal globalization**]{.underline};]{.mark} or, one
could say that the humanist argument in climate activism that criticizes
the inherent limitations of accelerated capitalistic expansion's
non-sustainability directly constitutes this paper's fundamental
'ecological' limitation and argumentative logic. This paper will then
mobilize this aporia of [contemporary climate activism]{.underline},
which [we find **accelerated today** into the **simulation** of its
**veracity**, by analysing some exemplary debates around the
preservation of '**nature'** and '**wilderness'** in traditional
environmentalism. Environmentalism, which took off in terms of a wider
scientific and public concern with the publication of Rachel Carson's
Silent Spring in 1962, provides a **good starting point** in order to
discern which **paradoxical tropes** and **calls** for action inform
'**green'** political engagement in general. In its **incessant
compulsion** to cover over its own **internal contradictions** namely,
[environmentalism has **mutated** into climate change activism due to
the latter's **heavy indebtedness** to **scientific** and
**technological** attempts at **modelling 'reality'** and making
**predictions**]{.mark}.]{.underline} This analysis agrees with Ulrich
Beck's thesis on risk society in World at Risk, although it does not see
the cosmopolitan impetus that arises from risk's global spread as
necessarily positive in terms of political mobilisation. [The problem
is]{.underline} namely [that [climate change as a **techno-political
apparition**]{.mark} which is '**more real** than **reality itself'**
emerges out of the **ambiguous representation** of '**nature'** that
marked environmentalism, and [is]{.mark} as such [implicated in the
**acceleration** and **magnification** of **risk** through its **global
political mobilisation**.]{.mark} It is in turn out of this
**ambiguous** **status** of '**nature'** that the **utter force** of
**technological reproduction** and **acceleration** brings about the
**in-discernability** of **reality** and **representation**. Under the
new conditions of acceleration then, the **artificial split** between
**image** and **truth** that has made possible **modern science** and
**philosophy** since the onset of **humanism** finally **implodes onto
itself**. Analyses of the relationship between environmentalism and the
media]{.underline} should therefore likewise go beyond common
descriptions in the social sciences of how the media influence popular
opinion around climate change, although such analyses are certainly not
without merit. Rather, these analyses [should also consider how [the
**illusion of the neutral** or **transparent communication** and
**representation** of 'nature']{.mark} in early environmentalist texts
[allows for the **possibility** of climate science's **truth-claims**
about 'nature,' even if such **technological acceleration** engenders
**increasing doubt** and **confusion** regarding the **truth of climate
change** and its **causes**, as well as to the **appropriate moral
response**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### Feminism

#### We don't have a proscriptive strategy so there is no threshold for a link argument to their position -- our offense comes from maintaining the possibility of trickery and seduction as part of a larger strategy of revolt is an option we should be willing to include. The demonization of the women who engage in such strategies proves there is nothing radical about their feminist stance. Bet on radical illusion.

**Grace 08.** Victoria Grace, professor of sociology at the University
of Canterbury (UK), "Baudrillard's Illusions: The Seduction of
Feminism", 2008, University of Canterbury, New Zealand, French Cultural
Studies 349--351

[[In feminist discourse]{.mark}, action and theorising since the
mid-twentieth century, [the woman who does not
revolt]{.mark}]{.underline}, analyse or go beyond, [[but]{.mark} who
rather **[employs her position to entrap and seduce the world into her
own domain of limitation, is a]{.mark} particularly [galling
figure]{.mark}**]{.underline}. **[She is [the butt of]{.mark} the
[patriarchy as much as the scorn of feminism]{.mark}]{.underline}**:
[she is the joke of the music hall, she is the demonic angel who knows
her place and uses it to diminish others in her own narcissistic
grandstanding]{.underline}. [[By making herself
'prey']{.underline}]{.mark}, according to Beauvoir, '[[she
arouses]{.mark} and [entraps men through submissively making herself
into a thing]{.mark}]{.underline}[']{.mark} (Beauvoir, 1953 \[1949\]:
727). [This passive position of entrapment invariably incites the
declaration that woman desires her position -- witness her delight, her
cunning and her satisfaction]{.underline}. As I discuss below, **[[the
perception of such a desire can lead to her being a victim of
sacrifice]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Although feminist theory has been
transformed]{.underline} since Beauvoir and the second wave [through a
poststructuralist critique and its aftermath, even though the object of
feminist concern is now the phallo-centrism of the binary structure
itself and not solely the position of women within it]{.underline}, I
think [it is reasonable to suggest that **[feminist theorising]{.mark}
still [wants to steer a course that is well clear of the figure of the
feminine depicted above]{.mark}**[. **This archetypal feminine (of the
fall) cannot be revisited in any
incarnation**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

[[This is where the ideas]{.mark} and provocations [of]{.mark} Jean
[Baudrillard appear to contain]{.mark} their **danger**, their
conservatism, indeed [their anti-feminism]{.mark}]{.underline}, and are
[therefore discouraging of feminist interest]{.underline}. [The very
word 'seduction']{.underline} (used frequently by Baudrillard, and the
title of one of his early books) [acts as a formidable
deterrent]{.underline}. I want to argue that consideration of [[what
Baudrillard is doing with seduction and similar concepts reveals why
feminists should not reject them]{.underline}]{.mark}; my intention is
to suggest **[they are [not only 'useful' but central to]{.mark} a
[feminist critique]{.mark}.]{.underline}** And simultaneously the
argument must be made for where Baudrillard's elaboration of these
conceptual foundations of his work needs to be critically reviewed for
what is possibly its departure from its own terms.

[Baudrillard for illusion]{.underline}

At the 'Baudrillard West of the Dateline' conference in Auckland, New
Zealand in 2001, Jean Baudrillard concluded his response to a question
from Nicholas Zurbrugg in a roundtable discussion with the statement
that '**[Look, [I am not above reality]{.mark}, but [I am not for
hyperreality. I am for illusion']{.mark}]{.underline}** (Baudrillard,
2003: 183). **[[Baudrillard is for illusion, seduction, reversion,
singularity, challenge]{.underline}]{.mark}**. He [[seeks a world in
which **a radical otherness**]{.underline},]{.mark} an [[exquisite
alterity]{.underline}, **[flourishes]{.underline}**]{.mark}. [[This
**vigorously critical ontology of absence**]{.mark} and the nothing is
pitted [against the **positivity of**]{.mark} **production**,
**[identity]{.mark}**, **power** and the **universal** -- [a **logic of
positivity**]{.mark}]{.underline} I argue elsewhere [[is **that of
phallo-centrism**]{.underline}]{.mark} (Grace, 2000). [A [philosophy of
**the object as illusion** is one that refuses a valorising of identity
and authority; it **cannot abide a politics of yearning for the position
of subject** in a subject/object dialectic]{.mark}]{.underline} (or in
accordance with Beauvoir a world in which all humans are subjects).
[[**To produce, is to make visible**; to seduce is to **remove from the
visible order**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} [[To
**produce**]{.underline}]{.mark}, within [[**a code of language and
economic exchange** is to **make**, or **perform**, **reality** as the
thingness of things, to **accumulate reality**, to have **more and more
of it**]{.mark}. **To seduce is the movement**, or principle, that
**ensures that 'things' circulate**, and **in their circulation they
cancel each other out**. They do not remain, they do not accumulate,
**they circulate; they appear and disappear**.]{.underline}

[This appearance and disappearance is]{.underline} sometimes referred to
by Baudrillard as [reversion]{.underline} -- **[[the inevitable
reversibility of the world]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In the early years of
his work, [Baudrillard's **unique and profoundly important
theorisations** circled around the fundamental problem of the social
constitution of forms of generalised exchange. [Any form of generalised
exchange attempts]{.mark}]{.underline} (it can never succeed) [[to
**obliterate the singular and incorporate it into a system** whereby a
**generalised standard of exchange** becomes the benchmark against
which]{.mark} value or [identity is determined]{.mark}]{.underline}. [As
soon as the value of an object is determined relative to another for the
purpose of an economic exchange, it takes on its identity within that
relation of value: one hen is equal in value to a sack of
manure.]{.underline}

How do we know this? By reference to a generalised scale of value that
creates abstract quantities as units that can be added together. [[The
meaning of words in linguistic exchange can be ascertained through **a
system of signification** that generalises a method to establish that
**a word means this and not that**]{.mark}.]{.underline} [The
systemisation of generalised exchange in the domains of value and
meaning liberates all exchange into the realm of the possible: only
possible because the ontology of objects and language is locatable
within that broader system. It is here relative to there; it has this
value relative to that; it means this relative to (not) that. [Such an
order of economic]{.mark} and semiological [exchange attempts to reduce
the singularity of the illusion]{.mark} of things and beings [into the
**order of reality on a universal scale of difference and
comparability**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [As soon as such a scale is
instituted, [**the binary constitution of the world is established**,
the **universal is possible**, singularity no longer
features]{.mark}]{.underline}. Since this early work Baudrillard has
theorised a shift in the political economy of the sign and its parallel
economic form, a shift from the universal to the global as the hyperreal
morphs into the integral reality of the virtual. Before explaining this
in more detail, a word on Baudrillard's notion of duality. [**There is
frequent confusion** with Baudrillard's reference to the significance of
duality. With irreducible otherness,]{.underline} with the impossible
exchange 351 of singularities, [we confront the dual
relation.]{.underline} As Baudrillard said at the roundtable discussion
in 2001: Duality, duel, dopplegänger. All that is beyond the
individuality \[sic\], the other. [Duality doesn't at all mean two, two
things, two beings. There may be multiple ones but with duality there is
a sort of symbolic challenge, and for challenging you must be opposite,
you must be antagonistic, you must not be in a dialectical relation
between subjects and objects, between individual and other, the social.
That is our system of values but we must break with it \... [We must
restore the secret of duality, of the dualistic, in the core of our
situation, of our actual system]{.mark}.]{.underline} (Baudrillard,
2003: 187) Following Nietzsche, this intervention of
[[Baudrillard's]{.underline}]{.mark} (only very briefly sketched here)
[[represents]{.underline}]{.mark}, I think, **[[the most radical
critique of the structure of identity/difference and its ontological
commitments that we]{.underline}]{.mark}** (in our occidental
philosophy) [**[have]{.mark}**. Its seduction not only reverses the
universal and its truth, but also the investments in generalised
economic and semiological exchange on which this structure
relies]{.underline}. Through this critique, [identity/difference as a
system of equivalence/non-equivalence confronts the alterity of duality;
its terms become that of the duel, a relation of the agon, and they
cannot be exchanged. [**This has to be consistent with a feminist
project to transform** **specifically the phallo-centric investments**
in this **very structure of
identity/difference**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}

#### Their version of feminism is still complicit with the dominant logic of capitalistic production: we must produce ourselves as feminist subjects with identity. Against this, the 1AC maintains the possibility of a thinking of the figure of the female beyond identity, beyond the injunction towards producing oneself as an entirely intelligible subject in late capitalist modernity.

The word '[[seduction']{.mark} has appeared]{.underline} a number of
times in this volume, usually [in conjunction with]{.underline} other
terms such as '[symbolic exchange', 'reversion',
'otherness';]{.underline} [always in association with that
which]{.underline}, in Baudrillard's terms, **[[is structurally
eradicated or barred by the ideological institutions of semiology and
axiology]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In Chapter 1, I referred, in note 18,
to '[[seduction']{.mark} as that which [is **counter to
production**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Where [[production is]{.mark}
literally [**making something appear**, **bringing into the realm of the
visible or perceivable**]{.mark}]{.underline} (or even performing, as in
a theatre on a stage), [[seduction is that movement that **removes from
the realm of the visible, that vaporises 'identity'**]{.mark}, and is
marked by ambivalence]{.underline}. [Seduction is about **reversion and
disappearance**, neither of which is recognisable within a productivist
logic]{.underline}. In Chapter 2, [I discussed the concern of feminists
to articulate an 'otherness which is not the otherness of sameness', an
'otherness' which is not always and inevitably caught up in the
oppositional logic of the binary form where the feminine is always
opposed to, or different from, the masculine]{.underline}. Given this
concern, Baudrillard's writing on 'seduction' is pertinent for
consideration by feminists, and engagement by feminist theory. [[The
word 'seduction']{.mark}, in the Anglo-American context, [is resolutely
associated with a kind of predatory male behaviour]{.mark} bent on
conquest (typically sexual), usually followed by abandonment of the
seduced, or alternatively a female behaviour designed to turn the male
on a path towards evil and his downfall]{.underline}. '[Seduction' is
taken overwhelmingly to be an abuse and manipulation for selfish ends
that aim purely to satisfy the seducer (subject), with no concern for
the seduced (object or victim]{.underline}). When a male 'seduces' a
female (especially a 'young and beautiful' one) for his 'pleasure', [[we
have the ingredients for the objectification, domination, oppression,
and manipulation of women by men]{.mark}, or of the feminine by a
masculine order, ingredients which, of course, feminists
revile]{.underline}. **[Alternatively, '[seduction', in its association
with the feminine, is cast as the feminine resolution of the oedipal
complex]{.mark}]{.underline}** (see Grosz 1989: 137), [**and [hence
inevitably situated within the parameters of the Law]{.mark}. Given the
intransigence of these meanings of 'seduction',** [it is **exceedingly
hard to release the notion of seduction** from these **associations** in
the process of considering Baudrillard's use of the term]{.mark}. It is
crucial to acknowledge]{.underline}, however, **[that [Baudrillard's use
of the word 'seduction' is precisely in opposition
to]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [and [a process of critique of, these
accepted readings]{.mark};]{.underline} in fact, as will become
apparent, [his usage of the word problematises the very terms of these
interpretations]{.underline}. In this chapter I will introduce
Baudrillard's analysis of 'seduction', and consider its challenge to
feminist theory. It is ['**[seduction's' quality of reversion]{.mark},
or reversibility, [that points towards an important insight for feminist
critique and understanding]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Seduction
[**[Seduction lies in]{.mark} the [transformation]{.mark} of things
[into pure appearances]{.mark}**.]{.underline} (SEDN: 117)
[Baudrillard's theoretical works **critique the productivist logic
common to the major discourses of modernity**]{.underline}:
**[production itself, power, economic value, meaning, representation,
the subject, identity, nature, desire, sex, sexuality, knowledge, the
real]{.underline}**. In other words, [these constructs are, in different
ways, relentlessly **predicated on the ineluctability of presence, of
increase**]{.underline}, **[on the inalienability of existence in the
positive, against the negative, the destructive, the
absent]{.underline}**. Foucault, whose work has been so eagerly embraced
by feminist theorists, has even formalised the transformation of the
seemingly negative into the positive, reflecting the fact that the
binary scansion of 1/0 registers absence as another positivity, so that
all discourses are now understood as 'productive'. Accordingly, the
exercise of power, rather than being understood as a prohibition, is a
force that produces the social; it has effects. Contrary to those
feminist writers who claim or assume that there is, or can be, no
position outside the Law, Baudrillard's notion of seduction is precisely
about that which challenges the Law. [**[Seduction does not oppose
production, but]{.mark} rather [transforms it]{.mark}, annuls its
singular and transcendent positivity, and [reverses its assumption of
unilinear accumulation]{.mark}**. 'Seduction' is not about negation, it
is about **neither presence nor absence**, but about a process whereby
**absence 'eclipses presence'**]{.underline}, [or where **absence
'seduces' presence** rather than opposing it]{.underline}. [Its strategy
is both to be there and not be there, hence its
ambivalence.]{.underline} [[Seduction is **an inverse power**]{.mark};
in itself it has no power; **its power is [to annul the power of
production]{.mark}**]{.underline} [(the positive, non-reversible
assumption of identity) [through **reversion**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[The logic of production is one of accrual; seduction is not that which
negates or opposes that accrual, but that which transforms it.
Baudrillard insists that '[everything demands to be exchanged, reversed,
and abolished within a cycle']{.mark}]{.underline} (SEDN: 45), **[[hence
the illusory nature of production, or of any non-reversible
ontology]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Seduction is precisely not of the
order of representation; the distance between sign and referent,
discourse and world, which marks an order of representation is
abolished]{.underline}. In Baudrillard's writing, [[the whole **edifice
of representation**, of **a semiological structure that codifies
'reality'**, is deemed to be **an ideological process that reduces the
symbolic**]{.mark}, in other words, that [**obscures or bars the
inevitable cyclical process of presence**, seducing **absence**,
seducing **presence**]{.mark}: of **creation and destruction**, **life**
and **death**, **appearance** and **disappearance**, **truth** and
**illusion**. A poststructuralist ontology, postulating the social
construction of reality through a critical rendition of the idea that
meaning obtains through language and not through its relation to an
extradiscursive world, only goes part of the way. It still posits the
inevitability of this linguistic structuration, of the Law, of the
binary structuring of meaning where deconstruction remains in the realm
of the semiotic, and is of uncertain import.]{.underline} [Baudrillard's
notion of [seduction]{.mark} is not only critical of the assumptions of
reference]{.underline}, but, **[[through a critique of the conditions
under which reference becomes possible, develops a critique of the
entire process of codification]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Materialising
the world through a representational linguistics (reference or no
reference) works against the seductive interplay of signs]{.underline}.
[Seduction is therefore also about the annulment of signs, their
reversion, and the transformation of their meaning into 'pure
appearance']{.underline}.

#### White feminism DA

#### Feminist criticisms reinforce the identarian limits that contribute to inequalities predicated on difference

[The dichotomous coupling of identity/difference means the focus on the
'one' brings with it the inevitability of the 'other']{.underline}. As
noted by Edward Said (1989), anthropological reflections on 'otherness'
and 'difference' invariably invoke that 'secret sharer', identity and
identarian thought; one could say in parallel that [feminist reflections
on identity implicate their twin concern, that of
'difference']{.underline}. [Feminist inquiry into the logic of 'sexual
difference' has witnessed considerable attention paid in the
Anglo-American context to the dilemma of advocating a politics of
equality, or a politics of difference]{.underline}. Intractable
contradictions are evident whichever way it goes, when the male is the
norm against which both sameness and difference are registered.
**[[Equality for women with men]{.underline}]{.mark}** (sameness)
[**[where men remain the standard]{.mark} of reference [does not resolve
the problem]{.mark}, and [nor does women's 'difference' from men when
men remain the standard]{.mark} of reference** against which the
different feminine is rendered inferior or otherwise]{.underline}. Hence
the theoretical endeavour to critique the structural bar that creates
the dichotomous construction. [This theoretical critique]{.underline},
however, [has revolved more consistently around a feminist concern to
articulate 'difference' differently]{.underline}, as discussed in
Chapter 2, and [in doing so tends to return to identarian thinking with
its essentialist underpinnings and insistence on the importance of the
'female subject']{.underline}. Baudrillard's challenge is to [push this
critique of the structural bar further]{.underline}. [[Feminist attempts
to reconceptualise 'alterity' and 'otherness' will continue to fall on
barren ground without a more fully developed theoretical critique of the
structural conditions of their erasure]{.underline}]{.mark}. In fact
Baudrillard's analysis makes the case that the ground has shifted. As
introduced in earlier chapters, the advent of the structural law of
value, sign value, at heart hyperreal and simulated, is propelled by a
logic of difference. [Identity/difference, where 'difference' is the
negative]{.underline} (-) [of identity, is no longer the structuring
polarity; [our attention must turn to the proliferation of differences
structured in accordance with]{.mark} the precession of [the
model]{.mark}]{.underline}. In other words, [the contradictions
accompanying the form man/woman]{.underline} (politics of identity or
difference) [can no longer be considered the key drivers of sexual
politics. [The need now is to rethink the stakes of a gender politics
configured in accordance with a logic of
simulation]{.mark}]{.underline}. [This is also the case for the other
'axes of difference' which have become central to feminist inquiry and
activism since]{.underline} the late 1980s. [As ('white, western,
middle-class') feminist concerns with the political positioning of the
feminine as 'other']{.underline} matured during the 1970s and 1980s,
[[problems with the exclusions performed through positing a unitary
category of 'women']{.mark} came increasingly into focus. These problems
were [palpable in the form of active opposition from those groups of
'women' who did not recognise themselves in the abstraction of 'women'
articulated by 'white, western, middle-class'
feminism]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Numerous feminist texts
published in the late 1980s and early 1990s claim the importance of
responding to this challenge and addressing the issues involved in the
fact that 'women' do not form a homogeneous group. By 1996 Zinn and Dill
were able to state that '\[m\]any feminists now contend that difference
occupies centre stage as the project of women's studies today' (1996:
322). Lennon and Whitford (1994) introduce their edited book on feminist
epistemology, Knowing the Difference, with a similar acknowledgement
that the problem of differences within the category 'women' has come to
occupy the 'centre stage' of feminist theorising. They claim that
feminists who were committed to the articulation of what was 'other' in
relation to masculine thought have 'had to confront the challenge of
other "others" for whom they constituted a new hegemony and in relation
to whom they themselves stood in positions of power and domination'
(1994: 3). They refer to the different experiences and perspectives of
women 'depending on variables such as class, country, age, colour or
sexuality' and also to their differing positioning within power
relationships (p. 3). Lennon and Whitford go on to discuss the way this
critique of the unitary term 'women' has also led to the notion of a
lack of unity within each individual 'woman'. This concept accompanied
the poststructuralist turn in feminist theorising and has led authors
like Fuss (1989) and Weir (1996) to write of 'differences within
identity'. Gunew and Yeatman (1993) begin the introduction to their
edited book, Feminism and the Politics of Difference, with the statement
that '\[i\]n its third decade, a dominant area of debate in second-wave
feminism concerns being able to deal with differences among women
without losing the impetus that derives from being a coherent movement
for social change' (p. xiii). Fraser and Nicholson (1990) refer to the
'growing interest among feminists in modes of theorizing which are
attentive to differences' (p. 33); Braidotti talks about the 'shift in
feminist theory towards difference' (1989: 91). Di Stephano (1990)
refers to the view that 'the totalising fiction of "woman" . . . runs
roughshod over multiple differences among women' (p. 65). Susan Bordo
(1990) provides a good example of the impetus in the turn to
'difference' in feminism; she begins her chapter: Recently I heard a
feminist historian claim that there were absolutely no common areas of
experience between the wife of a plantation owner in the pre-Civil War
South and the female slaves her husband owned. Gender, she argued, is so
thoroughly fragmented by race, class, historical particularity, and
individual difference, as to self-destruct as an analytical category.
The 'bonds of womanhood,' she insisted, is a feminist fantasy, born out
of the ethnocentrism of white, middle-class academics. (Bordo 1990: 133)
In 1987 Teresa de Lauretis was concerned that one of the limits of
'sexual differences' is that they universalise sex opposition, which
'makes it very difficult . . . to articulate the differences of women
from Woman, that is the differences among women, or perhaps more exactly
the differences within women' (1987: 2). And again in 1990, de Lauretis
refers to the 'third moment in feminist theory', its current, whereby
the subject is reconceptualised as 'shifting and multiply organized
across variable axes of difference' (1990: 116). Eisenstein and Jardine
published an edited book in 1990 with the title The Future of
Difference, and Eisenstein's introduction briefly summarises the history
of American feminism with respect to 'difference', claiming that a shift
in emphasis from one on equality (eliminating gender differences) to one
on valuing the difference of women from men (woman-centred or
gynocentric feminism) was an important backdrop to the development of
new views on differences among women (1990: xix). Charles (1996) charts
a similar history. Nancy Fraser (1992) also tracks the trajectory of
debates on 'difference' in the Anglo-American context as a prelude to
'revaluing' French feminist theories on 'difference, agency and
culture'. She refers to the issues that have emerged from these debates
as 'an explosive mix of contested concepts and practical conundrums' (p.
6), where every attempt to grapple with one problem seems to spawn
numerous others (for example, 'difference' in the singular being
potentially hegemonic and exclusive, yet the plural 'differences'
glossing over the power relations constituting differences differently).
[[Feminist analyses of the philosophical and political issues inherent
in responding to the 'shattering' of the illusion of a universalist
sisterhood of mainly North American, British, and Australasian feminism
have been diverse and comprehensive]{.underline}]{.mark}. At the same
time, [many of these feminist analyses raise varied critical questions
relentlessly in response to an unease with any uncritical embracing of
'difference' or 'differences', questions and concerns that are
consistent with the critique of 'difference']{.underline} developed by
Baudrillard (discussed below). To cite Donna Haraway: We risk lapsing
into boundless difference and giving up on the confusing task of making
partial, real connection. [Some differences are playful; some are poles
of world historical systems of domination. Epistemology is about knowing
the difference]{.underline}. (Haraway 1991: 160--1) Susan Strickland
(1994) develops a critique of a 'postmodern' version of difference,
paying close attention to the way difference reduced to a form of
depoliticised diversity is 'consumerist' in its logic. Butler and Scott
(1992) ask 'how can "colour," "ethnicity," "gender," and "class," be
read as more than attributes that must be added to a subject in order to
complete its description?' and 'to what extent does the theorization of
the subject and its epistemic postures through the categories of race,
postcolonialism, gender, class compel a full critique of identity
politics and/or the situated or encumbered subject?' (p. xv). Spivak
(1989) wants to critique and reject universalism, but finds
'multiplicity' to be a problematic alternative. Kirby (1997) worries
that 'postmodern concessions to cultural diversity' are sustained
through an inclusive logic that recognises 'difference' but within an
homogenising framework (p. 153). De Lauretis (1990) is concerned that
the articulation of differences as parallel axes seemingly on co-equal
terms does not provide the conceptual tools necessary to grasp the
constant intersection of these different axes, and how they are mutually
implicated in one another. While Gunew and Yeatman (1993) claim that
poststructuralist theory offers a means to do precisely this, they are
alert to what they perceive as 'the dangers inherent in certain methods
of accommodating differences' (p. xxiv). Bordo (1990) is cautious that
any incitement to attend to difference might become a dogma, with its
implications for a 'correct' perspective on 'race, class and gender' (p.
139); Di Stephano is concerned to distinguish between an 'imposed myth
of difference' and 'crucial and as yet subjugated arenas of difference'
(1990: 65). Di Stephano goes on to argue that 'difference' appeals to
essentialised identities as much as 'identity' does, and that this
critique seems to be stuck in a 'vicious discursive circle' (1990: 73).
Crosby (1992) also questions whether 'feminisms which "deal with the
differences between us" break out of this vicious circle in which women
are selfevident and history mirrors the present' (p. 133). Robyn Wiegman
(1995), particularly interested in the project of theorising race and
gender, attempts a reframing of questions of 'difference', suggesting
that the contemporary cultural moment is one of resistance to political
organisation based too rigidly in identity claims. This very fact, she
argues, is leading to a diversification of critical positions concerned
to 'deessentialize identity' (p. 5). Most importantly, Wiegman's
intention is to situate 'difference', that is, to understand how
differences are specifically produced contextually and contingently.
These kinds of critical question point to a frustration with the limits
of the debate as it is currently framed. Generally, [authors are
emphatic about the importance of the 'irreducibility' of 'difference',
of absolute alterity, or 'otherness', and yet [there appears to be a
relationship between the problematics revealed through the critical
questions raised, and the unsatisfactory quality of an emphasis on
alterity that fails to materialise]{.mark} on its discursive
articulation]{.underline}. In terms of Baudrillard's analysis, [[it is
structurally occluded]{.underline}]{.mark}. This occlusion is apparent
in the following paragraph by Braidotti (1991), which, in my view,
reveals a number of the points where Baudrillard's critique becomes
salient to this discussion. Braidotti is introducing her approach to her
topic of analysis for her book Patterns of Dissonance: [It will indeed
be a question of differences: differences between men and women,
differences among women, differences within the woman that 'I' is. The
difference that is thus marked and enacted is such that it would
disqualify any attempt at synthesising the referents]{.underline}. Like
weaving parallel lines which will never meet as one; like the contours
of two bodies in a film by Marguerite Duras, hermetically empathic; like
'pure', that is, irreducible and fertile difference. [A sign of infinite
possibilities of difference]{.underline}. (Braidotti 1991: 13)

#### White feminism DA

#### Traditional modes of feminist resistance re-assert the identity/difference binary -- allowing white, western, middle class women to stand in for woman as such. This generates additional conflicts on the social periphery via a war on difference carried out in the political.

**Grace 2000 (Victoria Grace,** Senior Lecturer in Feminist Studies and
currently serving a term as Dean of Arts at the University of Canterbury
at Christchurch, **"**Baudrillard's Challenge: A Feminist Reading",
Routledge Press, pg 83-88)

Turning to the consideration of 'difference(s)', the first point of
importance, foregrounded through a reading of Baudrillard's work, is
that '[difference' cannot be understood to transcend history and
culture]{.underline}. The analysis of the structural interweaving of
political economy and signification that is so central to Baudrillard's
insights enables a number of distinctions to be made. '[Difference' in
the context of symbolic exchange is closer to the irreducibility sought
by a number of feminist authors]{.underline}. Baudrillard refers to this
as 'otherness', where that which is 'other' is neither opposed nor
comparable. '[Difference' within the coded form of identity/ difference
instantiating the]{.underline} (linguistic) '[subject' and
the]{.underline} (economic) '[object' is of an entirely different
order]{.underline}. In this case, comparability, that [imperative of the
economic, is central to the construct 'difference']{.underline}. As
outlined in Chapter 2 (see n. 15 there), the 'identity/difference'
formula is premised on an abstract mathematical concept reliant on the
notion of criteria. Accordingly, [an element, any element, is
'identified' and is then used to construct the criterion for identity
across a set]{.underline}. In the note mentioned, I used the example of
apples. To continue with this example, if an apple has identity 'apple'
modulo2 its genetic belonging to the apple genus, apples may have a
whole range of 'differences' in terms of other criteria of size, shape,
taste, crispness, and so on. [To extrapolate to the issues at hand in
this discussion, [women have the identity 'woman' modulo some defining
characteristic abstracted to form a set, but some are black, white,
Asian, Arabic, Jewish, and so on. Thus the 'identity' that includes
'differences' inevitably postulates some kind of
'essence']{.mark}]{.underline} (even albeit a 'performative' essence),
[[and]{.mark} in accordance with this formulation [excludes or bars
'otherness']{.mark}]{.underline}. In the hyperreal mode, the signifier,
released from its anchoring in the referent, becomes the sign, in
Baudrillard's terms. As [[the 'natural' status of the real that precedes
its representation is no longer the reference point]{.mark} for
'reality', [the sign itself becomes the real]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
implosion of the Sr and Sd, or referent, discussed in Chapter 1, is
paralleled by the eradication of use value as the underpinning motif of
value, and the installing of sign value, where, in axiological terms,
value is not anchored to any prior standard of equivalence. The sign is
real. [The value of the sign (as object of consumption) is accomplished
through its differentiation from other signs. [The logic of
difference]{.mark} that structures the spheres of value and [meaning in
the hyperreal mode is still coded in terms of
identity/difference]{.mark}]{.underline}. But dislocated from the
referent, reality follows the model of value and meaning instigated by
the logic of the sign. '[Difference' in this formulation is thus still
predicated on the mathematical relation of identity modulo criteria, but
the [differences]{.mark} that inevitably result from the criterion of
identity [lose their negativity and become fully positivised as
signs]{.mark}]{.underline}. From another angle, differences are no
longer subordinate to equivalence; being the same isn't better! Being
'different' is just as good! In fact the more value associated with
difference, the better. [Hyperreality could indeed be perfectly
characterised as 'a sign of infinite possibilities of
difference']{.underline}, to pick up Braidotti's words, quoted above.
And the notion of parallel lines that weave but 'never meet as one' is
evocative of an image used by Baudrillard to conjure precisely the
exclusion of the 'otherness' of symbolic exchange with the advent of
economic value, especially in its form of sign value: freeways on an
American landscape where motorists travel at speed criss-crossing and
interweaving, but never meeting (except catastrophically). [Nothing is
exchanged or transformed, difference is fully recognised and valued, in
fact it is paradigmatic. Identities and differences all remain intact,
'hermetically empathic']{.underline}. Baudrillard begins Simulations
with a citation from Ecclesiastes: 'The simulacrum is never that which
conceals the truth -- it is the truth which conceals that there is none.
The simulacrum is true' (Ecclesiastes, cited in SIM: 1). Within the
order of a semiology of representation, [[reality is deemed to have an
ontological priority of some sort, definitely
antecedent]{.underline}]{.mark}. Within the order of simulation, signs
are the real, concealing the truth that there is none -- no real, no
truth. [[Reality and truth emanate from signs]{.mark}. The precession of
the model figures the real; identities and differences are modulated in
accordance with the model and proliferate indefinitely]{.underline}.
This precession of the model is at the heart of Baudrillard's notion of
simulation. [The hyperreal overturns any distinction between the real
and the imaginary, and leaves 'room only for the orbital recurrence of
models and the simulated generation of difference']{.underline} (SIM:
4). 'Orbital' is a spatial metaphor that conveys a sense of floating in
a vacuous space with no other gravitational point of reference than the
preceding model, and 'simulated generation of difference' refers to the
modelled (modulo, modulated, modal) quality of the resulting difference.
Baudrillard describes how simulation is not about feigning. Understood
as feigning, or as a form of pretence, [simulation maintains the
principle of representation and the distinction between truth and
falsity: 'the reality principle']{.underline}. To evoke the difference,
Baudrillard uses the example of illness. If one simulates paralysis (in
the sense of feigning) there is the appearance or pretence of paralysis,
but the 'reality' of normality. If, however, paralysis is simulated --
i.e. actually produced -- then the relation of truth and falsity, real
and appearance, implodes (and the limit of a medicine reliant on such a
distinction is revealed). It is in this sense that [simulation as an
order of the real obliterates the 'relation': the sign is the reality,
and there is no falsity to be unmasked. There is no simulation versus
truth: the simulated and the true are one and the same
thing]{.underline}. Referring to the status of the image, Baudrillard
argues that reality configured in terms of a relation of truth and
appearance means the image can be a reflection of a basic reality, can
mask, pervert, or distort a basic reality, or it can mask the absence of
a basic reality. But when reality is configured in terms of simulation,
the image bears no relation whatsoever to any reality: it is its own
pure simulation (SIM: 11). Thus Baudrillard makes it clear that [within
an order of representation, simulation is interpreted as false
representation, whereas within an order of simulation 'the whole edifice
of representation (is) itself a simulacrum']{.underline} (SIM: 11).
Clearly this implosion has serious implications for those social forms
predicated on the salience of an unalienable distinction between truth
and falsity, reality and appearance. In the western context, the social
forms Baudrillard discusses include, among others, science, medicine,
the law, and the authenticity of 'culture' (I will extrapolate to
consider the simulation of sex/gender and the parodic transgender
challenge to its 'truth' in Chapter 4). In addressing the question of
why it might be that we see the 'panic-stricken' production of
'realness' at precisely the moment of its demise, Baudrillard analyses
the sustaining of power in the 'strategy of the real'. Hopefully this
will become clearer as I discuss his examples. In brief[, [the forms of
power which are invested in the social institutions of modernity require
the binary distinctions of truth and falsity, reality and appearance;
these forms of power are predicated on reality staying where it
was.]{.underline}]{.mark} [This provides considerable momentum for the
continued staging of the signs of the natural, the true, the real, the
authentic, albeit in simulated form]{.underline}. Furthermore, 'when the
real is no longer what it used to be, nostalgia assumes its full
meaning' (SIM: 12), and the 'truth' of (the memory of) 'lived
experience' takes on a renewed intensity. Baudrillard incites his
readers to organise a fake hold-up of a bank: Be sure to check that your
weapons are harmless, and take the most trustworthy hostage, so that no
life is in danger (otherwise you risk committing an offence). Demand
ransom, and arrange it so that the operation creates the most commotion
possible -- in brief, stay close to the 'truth', so as to test the
reaction of the apparatus to a perfect simulation. (SIM: 39) But the
reaction will be such that the simulation cannot succeed. In the same
way as it becomes impossible to discover some absolute real, so too it
is impossible to stage an illusion. In the case of the fake hold-up, the
matrix of signs will combine the artificial and the real to such an
extent (a police officer will really shoot someone on sight, a bank
customer will really have a heart attack) that the illusory is absorbed
into the real -- 'you will unwittingly find yourself immediately in the
real' (SIM: 39) The point here is that the established order on which
the law is built trends towards reducing everything to some reality; in
this way attempts at simulation are 'devoured'. [[Transgression is much
less threatening to the established order, where obedience and
transgression are opposed.]{.mark} Simulation of an
offence]{.underline}, Baudrillard observes, [will either receive some
light form of punishment because it had 'no consequences' or be punished
as an offence]{.underline} wasting police time. [Both of these retain
the distinction of the simulated and the real, albeit in a relation of
equivalence]{.underline}. His point is that such an offence will never
be recognised and punished as simulation. To do so is to recognise the
abolition of this relation, which power cannot respond to, and which in
turn reveals the law itself as a simulation. [[For power to circulate
between the poles of policing obedience and sanctioning wrong-doing, the
law has to be based on the difference between the truth of identifiable
transgression and identifiable obedience.]{.underline}]{.mark} This
rejection of simulation is evident in the medical sphere. It seems to me
that this is most clearly apparent with conditions such as chronic pain
and fatigue, where alleged symptoms defy the medical production of their
evidence in the tissues or systems of the organism. Medical diagnosis is
reliant on the identification of the diseased organ or damaged system
within the body, as this is revealed through tests, scans, laparoscopes,
and so on. Where no such evidence is revealed, the symptoms must be
feigned in the sense of not real: 'there's nothing wrong'. To allow the
simulation of symptoms throws the epistemology and ontology of the
medical paradigm into turmoil. It effectively disables the distinction
on which medicine rests: between real, identifiable disease as causative
of symptoms, and wellness where there is an absence of such disease. It
is important to note that such conditions are experienced by women in
far greater numbers than by men, suggesting such challenges to the
medical mode of representation are gendered. The master-narrative of
'science' (biomedical, physical, or social) traditionally assumes a
syntax of 'subject knows object', science 'ostensibly masters the
object' (SIM: 17), and again, simulation threatens the poles through
which power secures its stakes. Baudrillard points out that [even with
the critique of objectivity, even when the singularity of objectivity is
broken]{.underline} (he uses the metaphor of breaking a mirror into many
pieces), [and science 'effaces itself before its object' now dispersed
into multiple fragments, nothing in fact changes. [To 'bow down before
"differences]{.mark}]{.underline}"' (SIM: 17[) [and to institute a shift
from mastery by the subject of science to the sovereignty of the object,
now challenged to 'speak' in its 'own voice', be a 'subject', is simply
a symptom of a different form of the confinement of the scientific
object]{.underline}.]{.mark} It merely means, in a way, that we have all
become scientific objects; along with all events and phenomena.
Baudrillard uses the example of ethnology, which could possibly more
broadly be referred to as anthropology, claiming that as soon as it
collapses in its traditional form, its place is taken by an
'anti-ethnology', 'whose task is to reinject fictional difference and
Savagery everywhere' (SIM: 18). Again, there is not only a retention of
and nostalgia for, but indeed a frenzied proliferation of, signs of the
real and of 'difference': 'reality' and 'difference' in simulation. Thus
Baudrillard is analysing a social dynamic where power is no longer
reliant on an ideological masking of the truth of social relations, but
rather on concealing the fact that the real is no longer real, of
'saving the reality principle' (SIM: 25). This process of concealment he
calls a strategy of deterrence. Before discussing in more detail the
question of 'cultural difference' in the hyperreal mode, I will continue
with examining this 'strategy of deterrence' and the displacement of
causality by the principle of manipulation, as these are central to an
understanding of simulation. '[[Deterrence']{.mark} is the
term]{.underline} Baudrillard uses [to [connote a process ensuring that
the fiction of political stakes continues to animate the
social]{.mark}]{.underline}. Unlike surveillance, or ideology,
[[deterrence is void of any notion of agent, class, manipulator,
interest; it operates precisely to activate these concepts in simulated
form to conjure their]{.underline} ([apparent]{.underline})
[reality]{.underline}]{.mark} (who can say they are not real when they
are simulated?). Referring to power, Baudrillard writes: [[When it is
threatened today by simulation]{.underline}]{.mark} (the threat of
vanishing in the play of signs), [[power risks the real, risks
crisis]{.mark}, it gambles on [remanufacturing artificial, social,
economic, political stakes]{.mark}]{.underline}. (SIM: 44) In
Baudrillard's analysis, [power]{.underline} '[for some time now produces
nothing but signs of its]{.underline} [resemblance]{.underline}' (SIM:
45). [[The political dynamic as a stake is empty, finished, appearing in
simulated form in a logic of social demand]{.underline}]{.mark}. Here
Baudrillard is referring to a demand for signs of power, signs of
meaningful political social relations. 'True' power was a relation of
force with stakes and strategy, but Baudrillard argues that [[these
things are now nothing more than an object of social demand]{.mark}, and
so, like anything else in the logic of consumption, [are subject to the
law of supply and demand rather than to violence and
death]{.mark}]{.underline} (which doesn't mean there is no violence and
death!). '[Power is no longer present except to conceal that there is
none']{.underline} (SIM: 46). [[Simulated power, simulated political
stakes, 'deter' the collapse of power]{.underline}]{.mark}. Baudrillard
suggests that [the only strategy against this collapse or 'defection' is
to 'reinject realness and referentiality everywhere']{.underline} (SIM:
42). It is this analysis that enables Baudrillard to refer elsewhere
(FS: 57--8) to the apparent discovery by those on the political 'left'
of the subversive nature of the claim that 'everything is political',
that the political was not confined to the level of governance of
nationstates but that sport, fashion, household arrangements were all to
be affirmed as 'political'. Again, [at precisely the moment when the
'political' implodes, it is 'found' everywhere.]{.underline} As
discussed in Chapter 1, Baudrillard argues that the hyperreal world of
simulation is an order of totalitarian control far greater than any
social form previously known. [The implosion of dialectical polarity
with the ascendancy of sign value addition to annihilating political
stakes, reconstitutes the operational construct of 'causality' in a
simulated mode]{.underline}. The notion of cause and effect is similarly
reliant on the poles of subject/object, active/ passive,
positivity/negativity. [The notion of one
thing]{.underline}/element/force causing/ impacting on/[transforming
another relies on the prior separation of that affected, or changed,
from its changing agent. Such separation implies a
distance]{.underline}, in turn implying contingency: some thing, or act,
may intervene and change the course of events, since there is a 'causal
relationship'. [[In social terms there can even be struggle and
resistance. With the collapse of the poles sustaining this causal
structure]{.underline}]{.mark}, Baudrillard argues that [[its
fundamental dimensions have shifted]{.underline}]{.mark}. Rather than a
relation of cause and effect, [[the precession of simulacra ensures that
the real is generalised from the model]{.mark}; the real proliferates
from the modulation of differences in accordance with the
model]{.underline}. Reality is coded. The best example is perhaps found
in the dominant discourses about genetics. 'The operation of simulation
is nuclear and genetic' (SIM: 3). DNA cannot be described as 'causal';
rather it codes, or programmes. The shape of things to come is encoded
in the form itself. There is no 'causal relationship', no determination,
but rather an informing. The significance of this concept of
'information' will become clearer when we consider Baudrillard's
analysis of the media, but first, I will discuss 'cultural difference'.

#### Essentialism DA

#### Feminism is caught up in a play of signs that have destabilized their purpose and make their critique ubiquitous. We can no longer distinguish empowerment from subjugation -- there is nothing keeping a third wave feminist from being a sex worker. Within the postmodern play of signs without referents, it is impossible to determine if we are feminist or not -- any argument to the contrary relies on an implicit standard of authenticity testing that should be rejected for harming women.

gender studies at Deakin University in Australia, "Baudrillard,
Postfeminism, and the Image Makeover", The Disappearance of Feminism,
Cultural Politics, Volume 10, Issue 1, March 2014, pp. 109-111)

With its emphasis on celebrating real female bodies, boosting women's
confidence, and encouraging individuals to make the most of what they
have, How to Look Good Naked positions itself against popular media
representations accused of depicting unrealistic feminine beauty ideals,
thereby seemingly aligning itself with a pro-woman agenda. In effect,
[[the social change impetus grounding a feminist politic is recast as a
narrative of individual female transformation]{.underline}]{.mark}. In
particular, [[the rhetoric]{.mark} of self-love and [finding one's
authentic self]{.mark}]{.underline} [([sexually and
socially]{.underline}]{.mark}) that typifies How to Look Good Naked
[[echoes feminist consciousness-raising efforts]{.mark} of the second
wave [that opposed "false" male-determined standards]{.mark} of female
attractiveness]{.underline} (Genz 2011: 123). [[Yet many of the features
that characterize the program]{.underline}]{.mark}, such as the
sexualization of the subject, an emphasis on heteronormative femininity,
and a focus on appearances, [are the subject of ongoing feminist
interrogation and critique]{.underline}. How to Look Good Naked thus
demonstrates a key feature of a postfeminist sensibility, described by
Gill as emphasizing "the contradictory nature of postfeminist discourses
and the entanglement of both feminist and anti-feminist themes within
them" (2007: 149). In this statement Gill [[allude]{.mark}s [to the
difficulty of judging which images might count as
feminist]{.mark}]{.underline} (and accordingly which fall into the
antifeminist camp) [within a postfeminist media landscape]{.underline}.
The issue at stake, it would appear, hinges on whether it is possible to
clearly delineate between a "feminist" and an "antifeminist" theme,
image, or action. [How might feminist media studies scholars approach a
program]{.underline} like How to Look Good Naked, [which does not label
itself as feminist but replicates the promotion of feminist values such
as bodily autonomy and selfdetermined sexual subjectivity]{.underline}?
[In observing that [actions considered by some feminists to be
oppressive to women]{.mark} (like gratuitous displays of the naked
female body) [become celebrated as signs of women's
agency]{.mark}]{.underline}, I'm not suggesting that the media construct
an "illusion" of women's empowerment that masks a quantifiable or
absolute "truth" about gender inequality. Taking this stance would be to
misunderstand the present cultural condition as described by Baudrillard
where signs hide nothing but become our reality. [[This comes
about]{.underline}]{.mark}, he argues, [[when signs can no longer be
distinguished from the reality]{.mark} they are supposed to
represent]{.underline} (Baudrillard 1994: 6). [Liberated from material
referents, signs can only reference themselves, resulting in "the
absorption of one pole into another]{.underline}, the short circuit
between poles of every differential system of meaning, the effacement of
terms and of distinct oppositions, and thus that of the medium and the
real" (Baudrillard 2007: 104). In a world that is increasingly
virtualized, it is the play of signs that influences the nature of
social experience, including gender relations, over and above the
reality once understood to precede representation. [[This insight is
central to contemplating the current predicament of feminist theory and
activism]{.underline}]{.mark}---how to speak about feminist agendas or
values when "the effacement of terms and of distinct oppositions" leads
to anything being potentially labeled feminist? [[In a postfeminist
media climate where sexual objectification is recast as a form of female
agency and the "right to choose]{.underline}]{.mark}" (regardless of
whether this choice is breast-feeding or breast implants) [[equates to
women's empowerment, differentiating with any confidence between
feminist and antifeminist themes becomes increasingly
difficult]{.underline}]{.mark}, if not impossible. Baudrillard (2005a:
18) has spoken about art in this way, observing that contemporary art
references past styles and other aesthetic forms to the point where it
has come to look like everything else, making it impossible to determine
what art is. Massculture texts like graffiti, advertising, and comic
strips are now part of the art canon. Everyday objects like cars and
beds, even urinals (as per Marcel Duchamp), have been labeled "art."
Cows in formaldehyde, garbage bags full of waste, people snoring---all
are examples of art that destabilizes the system of value through which
to discern the art object from the biological organism, consumer
detritus, or daily life. When art becomes indistinguishable from the
world it inhabits, Baudrillard claims, it ceases to be art in the way we
once knew it. While art, it seems, is everywhere and anything
potentially can be art, at the same time its liberation from a narrow
field of meaning fosters its erasure. We might extend this proposition
to say that [feminism, too, has become ubiquitous to the point where it
is both everywhere and nowhere. [When anything can be considered
feminist, the term becomes emptied of meaning and, accordingly,
disappears]{.mark}]{.underline}. That is, [feminism evades being neatly
defined or classified according to traditional political, economic, or
cultural categorizations]{.underline}. Let me be clear that feminism
"disappears" not because people don't believe in it (certainly, there
are many people who do, myself included), or because gender equality has
been achieved, but because its excessive proliferation under
postfeminism results in there being too much of it. Or more
specifically, [[the fundamental feminist principle of female
emancipation]{.underline}]{.mark}, as articulated through discourses of
gender rights, freedoms, and choices, [has become the overarching
rhetoric of postfeminist culture: it [contaminates all images, actions,
signs, and discourses]{.mark}]{.underline}. In making this observation,
I am in no way asserting that there is no need for feminist theorizing
and politics or that it is redundant. Rather, [the erasure I am talking
about]{.underline}, following Baudrillard, [refers to our collective
inability to coherently define or confidently determine the parameters
of feminism within a political and cultural economy that has become
virtualized]{.underline}. In other words[, [feminism becomes caught up
in the play of signs]{.underline}]{.mark} [and appearances
characteristic [of "immanent reversal" whereby]{.mark}]{.underline}, in
a society of simulation, [[things become their
opposite]{.underline}]{.mark}. Douglas Kellner explains it as follows:
"The liberation championed in the 1960s was to become a form of
voluntary servitude; sovereignty had passed from the side of the subject
to the object; and revolution and emancipation had turned into their
opposites, snaring one more and more in the logic of the system, thus
trapping individuals in an order of simulation and virtuality" (2009:
23--24). Under these conditions, how might we understand what feminism
is, what female emancipation looks like, how women's rights might be
characterized? The remainder of this essay is devoted to further
considering these questions through an examination of the makeover show
How to Look Good Naked. I demonstrate how, in coming to resemble, if not
naturalize, a feminist critique that opposes beauty ideals, How to Look
Good Naked exemplifies the illusory character of emancipatory politics.
This is the state of affairs that contemporary feminism must contend
with in the postfeminist era

#### Postmodern Consumerism DA

#### Their advocacy only reinforces capitalist imperatives and gender inequalities since their change is still rooted in the proliferation of signs

[A giant billboard of a woman in her underwear occupies a prominent
place atop the buildings of a nondescript English town center. This
display is]{.underline} not, as one might expect, the latest Victoria's
Secret ad campaign but [an unglamorous depiction of an "everywoman" in
an old pair of underpants and ill-fitting bra]{.underline}. She is, of
course, a participant in How to Look Good Naked, and [this public
revelation is one of the challenges she must face on her quest to
becoming a better self. Each wrinkle, stretch mark, lump, and bump that
the woman despises is amplified and available for public
consumption]{.underline}. Host Wan, who is accompanied by the mortified
participant, proceeds to ask passers-by their thoughts on her figure and
receives affirming replies. This activity is meant to convince the
participant that she is attractive and desirable, despite her misgivings
about her body. [While intended to encourage the woman to see her body
positively in the way others do, the process involves a degree of public
humiliation for the woman, problematizing the premise of the program to
foster female empowerment]{.underline}. McRobbie (2009: 140) in her
analysis of the makeover genre views [this kind of [female ritual
humiliation as a form of symbolic violence against women, whereby the
management and critique of women's bodies functions as a mechanism of
social control that relies on the co-opting of its
victims]{.mark}]{.underline}, who she claims are predominantly
working-class women seeking the help of experts. Via the theories of
Pierre Bourdieu and Judith Butler, McRobbie illuminates how [[the
shaming tactics and personal insults upon which such programs rely
extend beyond the individual to become an acceptable form of humiliation
on the basis of class]{.underline}]{.mark}. She argues that [it is
through the makeover genre that a particular "movement of women" is
produced]{.underline}---namely, lower- and working-class women whom the
hosts deem outdated, unkempt, and inadequate and who "show themselves
willing to undergo change, so that they more confidently and efficiently
take up their places in the emergent labour markets which need their
participation, and which will also then provide them with disposable
incomes so that they can consume more products and services over a
lifetime" (McRobbie 2009: 145). [[The purported aim of makeover
television to empower women via self-improvement]{.underline}]{.mark},
McRobbie claims, [[instead reinforces capitalist imperatives, class
stratification, and gender inequalities]{.underline}]{.mark}. McRobbie
does not use the word symbolic in the way Baudrillard would to
characterize the period prior to universal or generalized value systems.
She understands it in the Lacanian sense, as part of the order of
signification through which cultural meaning is produced. Thus McRobbie
employs the term [symbolic violence]{.underline} to [describe the
mechanism by which [class distinction is maintained]{.mark}]{.underline}
(after Bourdieu) [when [abuses directed at women]{.mark}]{.underline}
undergoing television makeovers (abuses that she believes are commonly
dismissed as ironic or harmless) [[become accepted and used in wider
societal discourse to slur working-class women]{.underline}.]{.mark} [By
understanding symbolic violence to occur at the level of
signification]{.underline}, McRobbie [forecloses on the possibility that
this violence may be of another register]{.underline}. To what extent
might the violence of makeover culture McRobbie identifies be suggestive
of the obscenity of visual representation itself? A "violence of the
degree zero" that results from an excess of signification that attempts
to secure meaning and consolidate our reality (Baudrillard 1990: 27)?
Just as Baudrillard deems [pornography obscene because its telescopic
rendering of genitals and sexual activities obliterate any sense of
mystery associated with the sex act, makeover TV can be said to function
along the same lines]{.underline}. In the case of pornography, it is not
the gratuitous representation of naked bodies that Baudrillard finds
obscene---rather, "[[what is obscene about this world is that nothing is
left to appearances,]{.mark} or to chance. Everything is a visible,
necessary sign]{.underline}" (1990: 34). The billboard featuring a
female participant in her underwear, as mentioned above, gives us the
body up close. It does not matter that the woman is not fully
naked---the intimacy of the body is displayed in the hyperreal
illumination of every curve, hair, wrinkle, fold of skin--- seemingly
every pore is enlarged and able to be scrutinized. [[This excess of
reality generates the semblance of authenticity associated with reality
TV]{.underline}]{.mark}. Regardless of whether the bodies in question
are undergoing plastic surgery or appear "au natural," [makeover TV
simulates an authentic femininity in the form of women striving to
realize their true self through personal and physical transformation and
betterment]{.underline}. Baudrillard provokes us to consider
postfeminist media artifacts in different terms to McRobbie's critical
logic. In contrast to McRobbie's usage, [the [symbolic
violence]{.mark}]{.underline} Baudrillard speaks about [[is a
consequence of excluding the symbolic register]{.mark}---the violation
occurs [because we attempt to secure reality through the actualization
of the gendered, raced, classed subject/body. The proliferation of
"authentic" or "real" female bodies]{.mark}]{.underline} in How to Look
Good Naked **[[operates as a form of violence, in that women's social
and personal liberation has no coherent meaning when any action
performed by the female body can be potentially rendered emancipatory
within the specter of simulation]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Baudrillard
alerts us to the possibility that, in a culture of integral reality or
fourthorder simulation, images do something other than produce meaning
about class norms and gender expectations in the way McRobbie's critique
of makeover TV suggests. Through Baudrillard, McRobbie's proposition can
be extended to acknowledge that the symbolic violence of the
postfeminist text is tied to the changing purpose of the image and its
value---it can no longer represent authentic femininity, real bodies, or
pro-feminist attitudes but can only play at communicating meaning around
these terms. **[[Any message about women's empowerment]{.mark},
autonomy, or choice]{.underline}** that How to Look Good Naked seeks to
promote through the makeover process **[[is made meaningless
when]{.mark} seemingly [anything]{.mark}]{.underline}** (in this case,
appearing seminaked on a billboard) **[[becomes a sign of female
empowerment]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

#### Their over-proliferation of signs further imposes meaning onto the world -- this turns their criticism as it only reinforces the attempt to determine what is/isn't "feminist"

**Toffoletti 14** (Kim Toffoletti, a senior lecturer in sociology and
gender studies at Deakin University in Australia, "Baudrillard,
Postfeminism, and the Image Makeover", The Disappearance of Feminism,
Cultural Politics, Volume 10, Issue 1, March 2014, pp. 115-117)

In discussions of makeover reality TV, [image not only refers to a
representational form but can be understood in terms of the presentation
of the self.]{.underline} How to Look Good Naked alludes to the fractal
nature of gendered identity when one's self-image is in a process of
ongoing transformation. [This process of self-fashioning is hardly
new]{.underline} (see Greenblatt 2005), [yet it increasingly involves
the consumption of an ephemeral configuration of signs and practices.
While creating a new image is the aim of the makeover transformation,
what this new image should be is not clearly defined]{.underline} in How
to Look Good Naked. Despite the formulaic nature of the show,
[surprisingly little emphasis is placed on participants to meet a
socially desirable body type or fashion style]{.underline}. The women
involved are not expected to lose weight, wear hair extensions, or get
breast augmentations. [Instead of transforming the physical self to look
younger and skinnier, the emphasis]{.underline} in How to Look Good
Naked [is on feeling more confident and sexy through changing one's
attitude]{.underline}. [The point to be made here is not]{.underline}
that How to Look Good Naked offers [a better or more progressive
alternative to other makeover shows]{.underline}. As is the case
throughout the self-improvement genre, [looking fabulous is directly
connected to feeling fabulous]{.underline}, even if, in the case of How
to Look Good Naked, [there is no standardized feminine type to be
emulated]{.underline}. Rather, [this promotion of all styles, figures,
ages, and sizes gestures toward the phenomenon that Baudrillard
identifies as a "trans" state, when "everything aestheticizes
itself]{.underline}" (1992: 10). For Baudrillard (1993b: 5), [a "trans"
state of affairs signals the obliteration of categories brought about by
the saturation of the world by signs and images with no definitive point
of reference from which their value or meaning can be easily
mapped]{.underline}. In this context, [valuation of any kind is
impossible]{.underline}---the abolition of the coordinates through which
we once determined the beautiful from the ugly, the true from the false,
and the good from the bad now frees these concepts from their origins.
[No longer can we speak with any authority about feminine beauty ideals
or desirable female bodies when the distinguishing features to which
these ideas were once tethered have been replaced by the ethos that
"everyone can be beautiful]{.underline}." Under this regime, any body
can be fashionable, beautiful, and sexy, not just those of women who are
slender, youthful, and have flawless faces. The notion that all bodies
have become aestheticized is apparent in the range of reality TV shows
fixated on a variety of bodies---fat bodies and anorexic bodies
(Supersize vs Superskinny), elderly bodies (Sunset Daze), children's
bodies (Toddlers and Tiaras), and maternal bodies (Sixteen and
Pregnant). Indeed, the latest series of How to Look Good Naked
(subtitled With a Difference) draws the disabled body into the
transaesthetic sphere, giving these women the "right" to circulate
within the inexorable circuits of media and communication. [This
potentiality for all bodies to be made into signs for consumption
is]{.underline} also [strikingly apparent]{.underline} in the catwalk
show that concludes each episode of How to Look Good Naked. As a way of
testing whether the participant has taken on board the lessons of body
confidence taught over the course of the program she is asked to model
in a runway parade and appear in lingerie. Despite the initial
reservations expressed by nearly all of the show's participants,
invariably the women agree to partake in the exercise, hence proving to
the audience, the presenter, and themselves that they have successfully
learned "how to look good naked." It would appear that regardless of
whether the participant is fat, short, old, thin, ugly, plain, or tall,
she can achieve model status. Baudrillard's notion of [the
transaesthetic should not be construed as offering some sort of
liberation for women from the confines of a patriarchal beauty
ideal]{.underline}. [The transaesthetic instead generates a situation
whereby the potentiality of being "on show" cannot be escaped or opted
out of]{.underline}. This generalized aestheticization, Baudrillard tell
us, leads to a situation whereby "[all forms of culture---not excluding
anti-cultural ones---are promoted and all models of representation and
anti-representation are taken on board]{.underline}" (1993b: 16). There
is an extent to which Baudrillard's proclamations intersect with
feminist critiques of makeover culture, which identify the
all-encompassing reach of self-improvement rhetoric. Baudrillard (1993b:
15) goes even further, however, in observing that [there is no site from
which to resist, reject, or counter the accumulated positivity of value
that cannot be exchanged or reversed.]{.underline} Even though How to
Look Good Naked repeatedly denounces conformity to a standardized female
body type, [it is not to imply that the women who
participate]{.underline} in the series (and its viewers) [are somehow
liberated from the sphere of beauty and appearances.
Rather]{.underline}, more than ever, [all bodies are co-opted into this
scheme]{.underline}. Regardless of whether a participant deliberately or
unwittingly challenges familiar parameters of feminine attractiveness,
we can no longer say with any certainty that, for example, the tattooed,
overweight, or old are exempt from being or becoming beautiful. The
project of self-betterment, coupled with the transaestheticization of
beauty, shifts the stakes of the game---[beauty isn't measured by a
narrow standard only few can meet but has become something that is found
everywhere and in everyone]{.underline}. Certainly, we can point to
women who appear to reject the stereotypical look associated with
heterosexual femininity and the ongoing maintenance it requires. Yet
[nonparticipation quickly becomes absorbed into a sign
itself]{.underline}. Take, for example, women who do not remove their
body hair. While sporting hairy legs might seem a radical act of
resistance against the culturally desirable smooth and hairless female
body (certainly, there is no ambivalence in Wan's assertion that "waxing
is essential if you want to look good in the buff"), this anticultural
sentiment is another modality in the fashion system, where signs play
off against each other (Baudrillard 1993a: 98). Hairy legs have even
entered the style realm, as witnessed in 2010 when American fashion
retailer J. Crew included in its collection a pair of tights that made
wearers look as though their legs were covered in a fine black fuzz.
While this look was perhaps inadvertent, it nonetheless gestures toward
hairy-leggedness being made over into a fashion item.

#### We support feminism insofar as it is aimed at the code, however the affirmative has set aim at the content of the code without challenging the form -- this kills any solvency and breeds ressentiment. 

**Grace 2k** "Baudrillard's Challenge: A Feminist Reading" (Victoria,
Senior Lecturer in Feminist Studies and currently serving a term as Dean
of Arts at the University of Canterbury at Christchurch.)/

[[Baudrillard is clear in his support for feminism when feminist
critique and activism are aimed at the code]{.underline}]{.mark}, at the
fundamental problem of [the dichotomous logic that creates the split of
male/female and makes the female the unmarked]{.underline} term (see
MOP: 134--5). In the opening to this chapter I indicated that
[[Baudrillard's objection to feminism stems from his critique]{.mark} of
a movement [of those on the 'other' side of the bar who articulate their
desire to instantiate a subjectivity]{.mark}, a positive identity.
[Such]{.mark} a [desire fails to oppose the binary logic instituting an
essentialist and phallocentric ontology]{.mark}.]{.underline} In
Irigaray's work we have seen an ambiguity with respect to this desire,
but certainly [the desire is articulated: a desire for women's
subjecthood, and relatedly, a desire for the representation of women's
desire.]{.underline} [This is particularly evident in her insistence to
carve out a positive]{.underline} (+) [space for women]{.underline}, for
the feminine, in the face of Lacan's assertion that 'woman does not
exist' and that she, 'woman', cannot know or speak of her desire (see
Irigaray 1977, trans. 1985: 86--105). [[This seems to
arouse]{.underline}]{.mark} a degree of [[ressentiment; a form of
indignation that compels opposition.]{.mark} However, to reiterate, [the
attempt to demand a subjecthood, to insist on a subjectivity as
presence, fully positivised without a concept of reversion, will only
succeed in reasserting an essentialist premise, in semiologically
reducing the symbolic]{.mark}]{.underline}, and Lacan would probably
still only see himself reflected back in the mirror.

### Framework

#### Policy debate succumbs to simulation resignation. Apathetic information consumption short circuits all of their policy debate good arguments while leaving all of our offense in tact. We must attack the rules and procedures of policy debate as a simulation of politics to reveal its complicity in technological and capitalist modes of exploitation. Steal what you can from the game by tolling rather than participating in the game seriously.

Materialism: Critical Interventions in Game Studies' Material Turn*, pg
166-176, dml)

Throughout his recent work in game studies, Raessens himself has mostly
attended to the "political-ideological tendencies in serious games"
(Raessens 2009, 24), a genre exemplified for him by titles like Food
Force (United Nations World Food Programme 2005) and Darfur Is Dying
(Take Action Games 2006). 3 Following the work of Sherry Turkle (cf.
Turkle 1996), but apparently echoing Baudrillard, Raessens argues that
"[players can either **surrender** to]{.underline} the
[seduction]{.underline}\[!\] of Food Force and Darfur is Dying [by
interpreting the game]{.underline} more or less [according to the
encoded]{.underline} \[...\] [ideological frames]{.underline}
(**[simulation resignation]{.underline}**)," [or]{.underline} they can
"[**understand** these frames]{.underline} \[...\] [by
**deconstructing** the assumptions or frames that are built into the
simulation]{.underline} (**[simulation understanding]{.underline}**)"
(Raessens 2015, 254). Raessens rightly indicates that [the ideal
scenario]{.underline} here [is 'simulation understanding', when players
experience a "moment of **disavowal**---or **distancing**---that is
specific to games"]{.underline} (Raessens 2009, 28), [and]{.underline}
thus [become able to **identify** and **question the underlying
assumptions** of serious games]{.underline} like the aforementioned
examples. [This would allow for a mutually constructive]{.underline}
(and, Baudrillard would object, fully instrumentalized) [relationship
between a game, which conveys its ideological message through its
**procedural rhetoric**, and its players, who accept that message but
also engage with it to find its **procedural limitations**.
However]{.underline}, throughout his preliminary
[[research]{.underline}]{.mark} he **[[consistently
finds]{.underline}]{.mark}** game critics and
[[scholars]{.underline}]{.mark}---precisely the demographics one should
expect a measure of critical distance from---[[**overwhelmingly**
falling into simulation **resignation**]{.underline}]{.mark} when
playing and then reviewing both Food Force and Darfur Is Dying (cf.
Raessens 2009, 29; 2015, 254--55). His later research on the interactive
multimedia production Collapsus: The Energy Risk Conspiracy (Palotta
2010) repeats this finding---resignation remains the dominant reaction
among critics (Raessens 2019a, 99--100).

At this junction, [[the **goalposts** for serious games appear to be
**moving away** from understanding to resignation]{.mark}; effectively,
from critical deconstructive engagement to]{.underline} cold seduction.
For instance, when first confronted with these findings, Raessens
carefully questions whether "critical distance needs to exist in the
first place" because, he writes, "It is of course a legitimate
aspiration to teach children about hunger as Food Force intends to do"
(Raessens 2009, 32). Later, he praises Food Force and Darfur Is Dying
solely for [their "**clear political agenda**," which]{.underline} he
states "[can be considered]{.underline} an [emancipating and
liberating]{.underline} aspect" in itself (Raessens 2015, 256).
[Yet]{.underline}, having a clear political agenda on a representational
level is hardly specific to videogames, and [[**simply discussing**
political issues is **certainly not the same** as actually
**advocating** for and **effecting** liberation]{.underline}]{.mark}. By
the time the research has shifted to ecogames like Collapsus, [[we are
speaking **only** in terms of a potential for the
**instrumentalization** of play:]{.mark} the game "**might** contribute
to]{.underline} \[...\] [making people **reflect** on]{.underline} the
[global and political implications]{.underline} of the energy transition
[and act accordingly]{.underline}" (Raessens 2019, 93; emphasis mine).
To be sure, Raessens points to promising evidence that serious or
"persuasive" games are able to effect attitude changes in their players
better than other, less 'interactive' media (e.g. Jacobs 2018; Neys and
Jansz 2019). [I would]{.underline} certainly [not deny that there are
ways in which 'ludic' simulations **can** affect attitudes and
behaviours]{.underline} in both general and medium-specific ways.
[But]{.underline} again, [to point **merely to attitude change**, when
the initial desire was for serious games to be '**emancipating** and
**liberating**', feels like a **moving of the goalpost** for what they
are supposed to be able to do]{.underline}.

It appears to be the case that Raessens resigns himself to resignation
without admitting it openly, when simulation understanding is clearly
the more ambitious and preferable option. This makes some sense from an
academicinstitutional view: pointing to 'potential' and 'promising
evidence' invites further required research into one's topic of
choice---and I should clarify that I fully support the continuation of
that research. That said, we could also say that [this **unstated
resignation** to the 'seductive' power of simulation was a **foregone
conclusion** from the very beginning]{.underline}. Raessens has
identified four possible implications of cybernetic technologies, such
as videogames, for their users' relation to reality and the symbolic
order. [According to this model, [games may be
experienced]{.mark}]{.underline} either [[as]{.underline}]{.mark}
completely immersive virtual realities that can in turn be utopian or
dystopian, as "replicas of non-virtual life," or as "dramatic stages for
reality construction" (Raessens 2009, 24). Following this model are
[[**explicitly politicized** and **undeniably progressive**]{.mark}
analyses]{.underline} of the contents of serious games [[at
their]{.underline}]{.mark} representational,
[**[procedural]{.underline}**,]{.mark} and paratextual
[[levels]{.underline}]{.mark}. In fact, the emancipatory angle
throughout Raessens' work on videogames is generally a welcome one,
especially compared to the consistently depoliticized work of ludology
as discussed in the previous chapter. However, in the conclusion to one
of the texts I have been reading here, where Raessens effectively
concedes that the merit of Food Force lies mostly in its willingness to
even discuss the topic of world hunger at all, he writes: "Which of the
'virtual' tendencies become actualized is not directly inscribed in the
game's technical properties" (Raessens 2009, 33; emphasis mine). [The
troubling implication is that [a **politicization** of the very
technologies that underlie serious games is **off-limits**, because said
technologies have **no direct influence** over their political or
ideological properties]{.mark}, nor over the way that any individual
serious game constructs its own relationship to '**actual
reality**']{.underline}.

Apparently as a consequence, throughout the rest of his work Raessens
never implicates serious [[games]{.underline}]{.mark} themselves in the
problems they are addressing. Food Force and Darfur Is Dying, both
arguably dealing with the violent consequences of global capitalism,
[[are **never criticized** for their use of simulation technologies that
"promise the **containment** and **control** of]{.mark} such [supposedly
**accidental violence**, while]{.mark} in fact [**exacerbating** these
forms of violence]{.mark}]{.underline}" (Hoofd 2007, 7). Collapsus,
superficially so concerned with solving the climate crisis, is never
confronted with the contribution of videogame consoles and home
computers to ecological destruction and global warming (cf. Mayers et
al. 2015; Mejia 2016). [[At **no point** does the question arise of the
relation between **digital play** and the **cybernetic-capitalistic
systems** in which it takes place]{.underline}]{.mark}. At no point is
the observation that simulation resignation occurs so frequently, even
among critics and scholars, investigated as an issue that is bound to be
structural in a technology that has historically aimed for precisely
that effect---to envelop its users in a 'ludic' simulation, to draw them
further into the web of cybernetic capitalism, to 'seduce' them with
diffuse feedback loops in order to prevent seduction from taking place.
Furthermore, Raessens makes some allusions to the "medium-specificity of
computer games" (Raessens 2015, 251), but [that [specificity **begins**
and **ends** with games as **rule-based systems**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
The medium-specific materiality of videogames is left unquestioned, and
[[material conditions are **only made relevant** when relating their
**simulational parameters** to the **complex scenarios** they claim to
model]{.underline}.]{.mark} All this fits unsurprisingly well with the
narrative of the ludification of culture: there, too, [the ways that
capital operates through and within capitalistically produced media are
**left out** of the big picture]{.underline}. With the same brush, [[the
necessity for **interrogating the complicity** of scholarship itself in
perpetuating that system is **obviated**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

This is shame, because [a specifically humanistic and
critical-materialist]{.underline} game studies, with its [knowledge
of]{.underline} both **[procedurality]{.underline}** and materialism,
[should be adequately competent to]{.underline} heed Derrida's call for
the Humanities to [**reflect** on their relationship]{.underline} with
information and communications technologies (cf. Derrida 1984). From
studying videogames, we know better than anyone that [the **nuclear
apocalypse** those technologies may help bring about is]{.underline},
after all, [not only '**fabulously textual**' but also]{.underline}
possesses a "**[fabulously procedural]{.underline}** dimension" (Jagoda
2013a, 765; original emphasis). [It has not only been **talked** and
**written** about; it has been **played** out as well]{.underline}. The
videogame medium was, in a sense, built for this, and in our production
of game scholarship we cannot ignore that. Interestingly, Raessens does
implicate game scholars in this history when he writes: "Professional
serious game designers as well as serious [game theorists]{.underline}
\[...\] [have an **ethico-political responsibility** when they make
decisions about the ways in which they want to **design serious games**
and **construct theories** about them]{.underline}" (Raessens 2009, 33;
emphasis mine). I find myself unconditionally agreeing with this
sentiment, but it is also clear to me that [there is a difference of
opinion about exactly how deep this responsibility goes]{.underline}. If
we follow the narrative of ludification[, [it is **all too easy** to
place ourselves **outside** of the processes we seek to describe and
understand. Truly accepting the ethico-political responsibility that
comes with the construction of theory should]{.underline},]{.mark} from
a critical-materialist perspective at least, instead [[entail a
**reckoning** with the links between]{.underline}]{.mark} (serious)
videogames, [[**cybernetic capitalism**, and the **technological
acceleration** of]{.underline}]{.mark} Euro-American
[[academia]{.mark}---or]{.underline} perhaps I should say, [its
**ludification**---as well as with our **position as scholars**
operating within those structures]{.underline}.

A Politics of Complicity

[How]{.underline}, then, [can scholars play the game of]{.underline}
Euro-American academia and [the 'ludified university'
**differently**?]{.underline} [There is]{.underline}, for me, [**no
question** of whether [we should **play
differently**]{.mark}---and]{.underline}, with some hesitation still,
that we should play [**seductively**. [The institution **can be
changed**,]{.mark} and this change can be performed [through **every
aspect of scholarship**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Derrida writes
that, [in **every seminar**, **publication**, or **whatever other
manifestation** of the University, "an **institutional concept** is at
play]{.underline}, a type of contract signed, [an image of the **ideal
seminar** constructed, a **socius** implied, repeated, or displaced,
invented, threatened, transformed, or destroyed"]{.underline} (Derrida
2004, 102; emphasis mine). [In that play, [we are **inevitably
complicit** in the continuation of the institution's **current
form**]{.mark}, and with that complicity comes **another layer of
responsibility**]{.underline}. Gayatri Spivak argues that the 'response'
in responsibility "involves not only 'respond to,' \[...\] but also the
related situations of 'answering to,' as in being responsible for a
name," and, "when it is possible for the other to be face-to-face, the
task and lesson of attending to her response so that it can draw forth
one's own" (Spivak 1994, 22). There is, for Derrida and Spivak alike, a
certain accountability that comes with scholarship that often goes
unrecognized.4 [The institutional concept]{.underline} implicit in
Raessens' work, as discussed above, [is one form of this
misrecognition[: a positioning of scholars as largely '**outside**' the
phenomena they purport to study and a **disavowal** of crucial areas
where scholarly politicization is **long overdue**---an **avoidance of
complicity** and thus of **accountability**]{.mark} and
**responsibility**]{.underline}.

Consider, in contrast, the work of Phillips with the #TransformDH
Collective (e.g. Bailey et al. 2016; Boyles et al. 2018; Lothian and
Phillips 2013), which she describes as "a loosely affiliated group of
early-career academics working to bring social justice to the forefront
of digital humanities" (Phillips 2018, 125). This collective does not
merely address issues of diversity and representation within an
overwhelmingly white and masculine field, but also engages with the
consequences of digital methods for the Humanities in other ways. The
envisioned transformations are therefore quite radical:

\[...\] [instead of **smoothing out the bugs** in the digital
academy]{.underline}, we wonder how [[digital practices]{.mark} and
projects [might participate in **more radical processes** of
transformation]{.mark}---might **rattle the poles** of the big tent
rather than **slip seamlessly** into it]{.underline}. To that end, [we
are interested in digital scholarship that [take]{.mark}s [aim
at]{.mark} the more [**deeply rooted traditions** of the
academy]{.mark}]{.underline}: its commitment to the works of white men,
living and dead; its overvaluation of Western and colonial perspectives
on (and in) culture; its reproduction of heteropatriarchal generational
structures. [Perhaps [we should **inhabit**, rather than **eradicate**,
the status of **bugs**---even of **viruses**---in the system]{.mark}.
Perhaps there are **different systems** and **antisystems** to be
found]{.underline}: DIY projects, [[projects that **don't only belong**
to the academy]{.mark}, projects that [**still matter** even if
they]{.mark} aren't funded, even if they
**[fail]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} (Lothian and Phillips 2013,
n.p.; emphases mine)

[[To not be '**paracritical**' but **parasitical**, to acknowledge an
**irreducible complicity** and to accept]{.underline}]{.mark} what
Haraway calls a "**[[viral response-ability]{.underline}]{.mark}**"
(Haraway 2016, 114). That [is what a critical-materialist game studies
must do]{.underline}, it seems to me. For such a field, [[a **healthy
disloyalty** to the University '**within**' the walls of academia is
**preferable** over a **smooth incorporation**]{.mark} into its
corporate, cybernetic structure]{.underline}. Wellmeaning experiments
like Jerreat-Poole's Nonbinary and hybrid publications like First Person
Scholar quite naturally embody the tensions that come with this
position. They are undoubtedly in the business of questioning exactly
what aspects 'belong to the academy' and which ones do not; their
democratizing intentions are evidence of this, and there are certainly
ways in which they allow for a different institutional concept than both
the neoliberal university and white supremacist cisheteropatriarchy tend
to prefer. However, this questioning is already inherent to the
University's aporetic situation, and the technologies that facilitate
this process are all too easily co-opted by cybernetic capital---the
aforementioned 'democratization dispositif' in 'free' game development
engines like Twine and Unity being but one example of this (cf. Nicoll
and Keogh 2019). An academic politics of complicity should therefore be
constantly aware of the risks that complicity brings; for capitalists,
vectoralists, and for academics themselves.

Ludic Materialism, a New Paradigm?

I've argued, in a series of theoretical duels with Huizinga and some of
his followers (in order of appearance: Caillois, Sicart, Aarseth, and
Raessens), that there's no such thing as 'pure' play, a play entirely
distinct from the seriousness of ordinary life, informatic control, and
imperialist white supremacist capitalist patriarchy. In doing so, I have
aligned myself with French post-structuralism (Baudrillard, Derrida),
left-wing critical theory (Galloway, Hall, Hoofd, Wark), feminist game
studies (Chess, Gray, Phillips, Shaw), and game studies' material turn
(Apperley, Ash, Dyer-Witheford, Keogh, Kerr, Kocurek). I conclude that
[there is a version of]{.underline} (digital) [play that game scholars
**can** and **should** be advocating for---a version that's
**seductive**]{.underline} in the way that Baudrillard imagines it,
[simultaneously **inherent** to and **opposed** to the cybernetic
systems that seek to **contain** its unrelenting potential for inciting
the latter's reversion]{.underline}. An anti-capitalist theory of
digital play, [play-as-seduction]{.underline}, must acknowledge that
even seduction itself, in issuing its reciprocal challenge to 'ludic'
simulation, the principle of production, and the logics of capital, can
be the subject of détournement and recuperation. Digital play, [even in
its **most explicitly liberatory forms**, still needs to contend with
the fact that [capital **will not voluntarily accept** a truly agonistic
relation]{.mark}]{.underline}. When met with such a challenge,
[[cybernetic capitalism either **integrates** or it
**destroys**;]{.mark} often both at the same time, but never neither[.
The spectral figure of the **Gamer™** exemplifies this **perfectly**:
created by the military-entertainment complex to **control the
audience**]{.mark}]{.underline} of videogames, [[he determines the
'**rules of engagement**' for the medium to such an extent that even
those **nominally opposed** to his oppressive regime may end up
**serving his interests**. It is the responsibility of game
scholars,]{.mark} located]{.underline} as we often are [in a University
that itself obeys the laws of cybernetic capital, [to **unflinchingly
question** this dire situation and its **root
causes**---and]{.mark}]{.underline}, lest we forget[, [our own
**complicity** in its perpetuation]{.underline}.]{.mark}1

How will this critical-materialist paradigm fit into the current canon
of concepts known to game studies? Will it even fit at all? Might it
take its place among those that draw on the etymology of ludus and
ludere: ludology, ludocapitalism, ludopolitics, ludosity, ludic
economies, the ludic turn, ludification...ludic materialism? Perhaps
this could be a synonym for critical-materialist game studies, although
'ludomaterialism' would have been more grammatically
correct---materialism as relates to games, instead of a 'game-like'
materialism. Ludic materialism could, of course, be both. It might, for
example, take the videogame medium as its subject and then follow
Haraway's optimistic, world-building line of materialist thought:

[[We need to develop practices for thinking about]{.mark} those [forms
of activity]{.mark} that are **[not caught by functionality]{.mark}**,
those which propose the **possible-but-not-yet**, or that which is
not-yet but **still open**]{.underline}. It seems to me that [our
politics these days require us to give each other the heart to do just
that. To figure out how, with each other, we can open up possibilities
for **what can still be**]{.underline}. And we can't do that in in a
negative mood. \[...\] [[Through playful engagement with each other, we
get a hint about what can still be and learn **how to make it
stronger**]{.underline}]{.mark}. (Haraway 2019, n.p.; original emphasis)

Play might break the possible-impossible. It might also not. The 'ludic'
in ludic materialism should be met with suspicion even---or
especially---among game scholars, because, as Baudrillard rightly
observes, "Modern repression \[...\] operates in play (combinatory
liberty) as it flourishes in the mass-media \[...\] and as it culminates
in the critical play of the intelligentsia; it operates in the play to
which desire definitively resigns itself" (Baudrillard 2001, 66;
emphasis mine). [If academia is a **game** and what scholars do is
**play**, are we content with our play being **cold
seduction**]{.underline}, a 'combinatory liberty'? [Do we **resign
ourselves** and our desires for a better future to the 'ludic'
simulation that is the contemporary University? Or can we envision a
'**critical play**']{.underline}, like digital play, [that is **more**
than a **diffuse/defused intellectual agonism**?]{.underline}

What's more, with the ongoing expansion of gamespace in view, do we give
in to the neoliberal illusion that we have a choice not to do so, and
that we can escape our responsibility to fight it? Teresa L. Ebert notes
that "[theory is not simply a **cognitivism** but a **historical site of
social struggle** over how we represent reality]{.underline}, that is,
over [how we **construct reality** and the **ways to change
it**]{.underline}" (Ebert 1992, 13). [Theory and concepts
**matter**]{.underline}, and will always do so, [but with that
recognition comes **political obligation**]{.underline}. In the same way
that feminism relies on patriarchy as its core "struggle concept" (Ebert
1992, 20), maybe concepts like gamespace, military-entertainment
complex, and Gamer™ can serve as theoretical matrices that allow
critical-materialist game scholars "to perceive the way experience is
produced and thus empower us to change the social relations and produce
new non-exploitative experiences and collective subjectivities" (Ebert
1992, 32). [For that to happen, [we **don't need** a 'ludic' materialism
that **resigns itself** to]{.mark}]{.underline} the constraints of the
University or [[the **rules of the level playing field** that masks
cybernetic capitalism. We need a critical materialism that knows the
**potentials** and the **limits** of (digital) play as a vector for
liberation]{.underline}.]{.mark}

I cannot claim to have completed this line of thought by any means, nor
even to have provided a 'closed' argument in its favour. While some of
my writing zooms in quite closely on certain authors, frameworks, and
topics, much of it also paints in broad strokes, draws from many
different and disparate sources, and briefly employs concepts for a
paragraph or two only to discard them immediately afterwards. The large
number of direct citations make the text dense, but also provide its
reader with many avenues for further inquiry. [This]{.underline} all
[might be seen as a **lack of coherence** or **depth**, or it might be
taken for what it aspires to be: a sequence of [**provocations**,
**suggestions**, and **speculations**]{.mark} that [answer the call of
scholarly responsibility]{.mark}. Thought that aims towards
**liberation** and **social justice**]{.underline}, in my view, "[must
know that it is [playing **without any possible conclusion**]{.mark}, in
a definitive form of illusion, and hence of
putting-into-play---including putting its own status in
play]{.underline}" (Baudrillard 2003, 93 emphasis mine). Yes, this
deconstructive/seductive form of scholarship emphasizes playfulness in
its engagement with theory and praxis, but [this theoretical play **does
not need to be** a mere "affirmation of that which **already
exists**"]{.underline} (Ebert 1992, 11) [if one realizes that the stakes
can be as high in play as in any other mode of being. Especially now,
when the ludified university is being **further integrated into
gamespace** with each passing semester]{.underline}, and a great number
of highly educated graduate students and disenfranchised temporary staff
leave the institution for better-paid and slightly less precarious jobs
in other sectors, we ought to wonder more often what the stakes are in
the game called academia.

Sylvère Lotringer once named one of Virilio's first monographs on speed
a "theoretical accident" (Virilio and Lotringer 2008, 54). Of course, I
don't want to claim that my work is comparable to Virilio's start-stop
style of writing; I engage with similar issues, but currently I find
some measure of continuity and flow in my own thought preferable to
short aphorisms and endless implication. (More importantly, lengthy
theoretical development and analysis remains the only accepted mode of
humanistic media scholarship, especially at the graduate level.) I
would, however, suggest that there is a sense in which [[all critical
thought might strive to be]{.underline}]{.mark} such [an **accident**,
[an "**interruption**" of the status quo wherein "**something else can
happen**]{.mark} and a **space can appear**"]{.underline} (Virilio and
Lotringer 2008, 53). This suggestion comes with the important caveat
that theoretical accidents can also become "accidents of theory"
(Bratton 2006, 21), whose interruptions are immediately used to reify
existing systems rather than dismantle them. They could even be said to
necessarily always be both. Even the most critical work is bound up with
the subject of its critique, and in cybernetic capitalism we constantly
risk both destruction and recuperation. The three videogames I've most
extensively analysed here are examples of this, but so is this text as a
whole: my deconstruction of game studies inevitably also wants to be a
work in game studies, and my critique of the contemporary University is
written (hopefully) in accordance with the University's demands. It
seeks approval from those same institutions it ostensibly distances
itself from, never quite leaving their orbit in its endeavour to reach
beyond the horizon.

[We have yet to see whether the University is, or can be, or could ever
be anything else than]{.underline}, as Hoofd suggests, "**[fatally
wounded]{.underline}**" (Hoofd 2017, 137). [What is at least more
certain is that]{.underline}, like cybernetic capitalism, [[the
University is **fatally wounding us**.]{.mark} We are building this
post-discipline in an environment that pushes the **vast majority** of
its most critical workers---especially its Black, queer, disabled, and
feminine workers---into **financial debt** and **general precarity**;
and]{.underline} really, [we seem **quite unwilling** to talk about that
openly]{.underline}. This is less surprising when one considers that the
inherent goals of the University are in fact, for better and for worse,
partially aligned with those of cybernetic capitalism. [It isn't so
strange]{.underline}, then, [to suggest that "critical academics are the
**professionals par excellence**"]{.underline} (Moten and Harney 2004,
111) [[if our critiques of the University don't take into account the
potency of its '**outside**', its **parasites**, its
**Undercommons**]{.underline}]{.mark} as Moten and Harney call this
class. [[A politics of complicity requires us to **traverse that
parasitical universe**]{.mark}, to step into things
betwixt]{.underline}. Better yet: we should join the Undercommons in
class solidarity, if we weren't already among them to begin with.
[Ultimately, [our only choice is to "**sneak into the university** and
**steal what \[we\] can**"]{.mark}]{.underline} (Moten and Harney 2004,
101), [and to be prepared to **leave at any time**]{.underline}. Is it
imaginable at all, nowadays, for us to actually leave the University
behind? For game scholars, most pertinently, but eventually for all
critical pursuers of knowledge and justice? Can we still imagine the end
of capitalism and join "the prophetic organization that works for the
red and black abolition" (Moten and Harney 2004, 115)? What of
patriarchy, white supremacy, liberal democracy, the prison-industrial
complex, the State, the fossil-fuel industry, and any other remaining
orders of production? The admittedly fraught but apparently quite potent
alliance between seduction and intersectionality may be of use in these
matters, although it will undoubtedly require further elaboration. What
of the systems that ought to potentially replace the
aforementioned---communism, to name just one? To be sure, there's a
place for digital play in the struggle for communism: hackers and
modders are still reversing hierarchies within the cultural field of
videogames even as they are constantly being recuperated by capital, and
digital art has all but lost its ability to use cybernetic
infrastructures for purposes beyond capital's usual profit motive.
[**Steal from the Gamers™**, **give to the Undercommons**]{.underline}.

#### We defend debate a [meaningless game.]{.underline} This allows debate to escape neoliberal imperatives of production and cybernetic social conditioning by making debate an [arbitrary symbolic pact]{.underline} without justification. It also erodes hyperconnectivity and information saturation from within by making the world [more enigmatic.]{.underline}

Ambivalence of Gaming"
<http://insomnia.ac/essays/baudrillard_on_gaming/>) \*edited for
language

Some detractors treat electronic games as if they were a hard drug, but
for Baudrillard (1979),1 the games are merely the equivalent of soft
drugs. Like drugs[, [games fascinate]{.mark} us as much as they repel,
and from the standpoint of Western reason, they arouse intellectual
ambivalence]{.underline} (Baudrillard, 2002b). The game does this by
[leading us into an environment dominated by a mental surgery of
performance \-- a]{.underline} kind of \"[plastic surgery of
perception]{.underline}\" (Baudrillard, 1993c, p. 49). Yet [when we are
[in the game, we are]{.mark}]{.underline} also [[protected from \"the
brutalizing effects of rationality, normative socialization, and
universal conditioning]{.underline}\"]{.mark} taking place in the social
(Baudrillard, 1993c, p. 67). This is a very important aspect of the
ambivalence of digital games for Baudrillard \-- they originate in a
society that is increasingly ambivalent about its future. [The pleasure
of the game is]{.underline} at best [an uncertain and cool
pleasure]{.underline} (Baudrillard, 1988). Baudrillard (1979) pointed to
the artificial intensity surrounding the playing of digital games, but
he found this to be not unlike that surrounding a person watching sports
on television \-- and every bit as unhealthy. But we are too concerned
with health; [the gamer worries about boredom far more than]{.underline}
obesity and [death]{.underline}. It is better to be a gamer than a
jogger in Baudrillard\'s world! The jogger \-- contrary to the
delusional state he or she may be in \-- struggles only to exhaust and
destroy the body (Baudrillard, 1993c). Joggers disappear in
Baudrillard\'s world. The gamer, too, longs to disappear, but in an
ecstatic disappearance from which he or she is eternally reborn in the
next game (Baudrillard, 1990). The gamer fears only the dizziness
induced by the connections \-- the lassitude of network man
(Baudrillard, 1987). [[Gamers are viewed as immoral in the eyes
of]{.mark} those who work to engage all of society in the
[production]{.mark} game]{.underline}. But [the gamer]{.underline} is
[seduced]{.underline} by other possibilities and attempts to turn [away
from the order of production to an order of reversibility]{.underline}
(Baudrillard, 1979). [Reversibility]{.underline} for Baudrillard is [the
opposite of production]{.underline}, and gamers may be understood as an
exemplary form of it. Ambivalence, however, is a two-way street:
Ironically, the gamer is worked very hard by the game into a frenzied
state of a will to mastery \-- mastery of what amounts to nothing as the
game he or she masters becomes instantly obsolete (and soon \"upgraded\"
or replaced by another new game). Games, too, are victims of fashion,
and there is no greater game than fashion (Baudrillard, 1993a). The
gamer exists on the margins of political economy and is understood by
some to be an example of the élan of the system in capturing everyone.
[[The gamer]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, [[attempts to gain an escape
velocity from]{.mark} the system of [political
economy]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Some gamers feel their virtual
worlds are the opposite of political economy and its hard currencies on
which they frown. The currency of the gamer is simulacra, and simulacra
now exist in abundance (Baudrillard, 1990). So with a nod to the
political economist, we must recognize that the game should not take so
long to master that it would interfere with the next round of the
production of games. Like a drug that kills too many users, such a game
would be against the interest of the system. The flow of games, like the
flow of drugs, must not stop; the effects may be profitable and brutal
but not fatal. Baudrillard forces us to wonder, though, are gamers
actually onto something critics from outside of their realm miss? [It
seems a little too easy now for the political economist]{.underline} \--
and some players of that productivist game have survived into the 21st
century \-- [to see the social relations of the world outside of the
game encompassing the world of the gamer]{.underline}. But as much as
society reaches inside the game ([attempting to capture the gamer), [the
world of the game infects society]{.mark} outside the game.]{.underline}
Two Harvard researchers have recently released a study on how the
\"[[gaming]{.underline}]{.mark} generation\" is [[changing the workplace
as]{.underline}]{.mark} much as the [[places of
play]{.underline}]{.mark} (Beck & Wade, 2006). Games infect all forms of
entertainment today. The latest James Bond film (Casino Royale, a film
stuffed with special effects; Campbell, 2006) contains a chase scene of
several minutes\' duration. It takes place high above the ground,
between boom cranes, in a fantastic realm where the actors are placed in
a field not unlike a Super Mario Brothers game. Only an audience that
grew up in the realm of games could truly appreciate such a scene. Here
the game seeps out into other areas of life. Perhaps it is by
incorporating game logic that the system now attempts to pull some
people out of the game and into the movie theatre. Attendance at films
is in decline whereas game sales soar. At Casino Royale, the young
people in the audience appeared to take great perverse delight in seeing
the world of the game infuse the cinematic screen. Our tenuous grasp on
the real (or in this case, [[what we will accept as
\"realistic]{.underline}]{.mark}\" in a film) [[is challenged to the
core by gamers]{.underline}.]{.mark} With so many people today gripped
by the virtual, it is not surprising to see so much cinema devoted to
the idea. Baudrillard (2000) has written about several films that fall
into this obsession: The Truman Show, Total Recall, Existenz, and The
Matrix. Baudrillard, who did not like The Matrix (he said it was \"the
kind of film about the matrix that the matrix would have been able to
produce\"; Baudrillard, 2004, p. 1), must have smiled wryly at the
release of The Matrix Online (a [role-playing]{.underline}
[game]{.underline} where players [are required to protect \"the
matrix\").]{.underline} We may wonder if this is some sort of cinematic
revenge on gamers or even an attempt by cinema to regain some of its
lost confidence (Baudrillard, 1998). [[Gaming may]{.mark} also
[be]{.mark}]{.underline}, Baudrillard (1996) tells us, [[the only
democracy]{.mark} we still know. Those who might have become political
players in earlier times may well be the gamers of today]{.underline}
\-- virtual exiles of politics circulating the networks of a muted
world. Gamers are among the contemporary inhabitants of [the
transpolitical \-- \"politically indifferent and undifferentiated
beings]{.underline}\" (Baudrillard, 1993c, pp. 24-25). [Unlike reality,
which incessantly demands we believe in it, the illusion of the
game]{.underline} (which the gamer never really believes in) [does not
hold such a requirement.]{.underline} For Baudrillard, [[it is]{.mark}
precisely [because the gamer does not believe in the game that
(they)]{.mark} ~~he or she~~ [enters into a]{.mark} more necessary
[relationship]{.mark} with the rules of the game.]{.underline} Here
[[society and the law are replaced by a symbolic pact]{.mark} with the
rules]{.underline} \-- a series of [ritual obligations]{.underline}
(Baudrillard, 1979) \-- that are, for Baudrillard, an order of fate.
[[All are equal before the arbitrary rules of the
game]{.underline}]{.mark} in a way we are not equal before the law in
society (Baudrillard, 1996). The game is a very severe place of rules
where wealth and social standing have no purchase. If games attract us,
for Baudrillard (1979), the reason is clear: \"Games are serious, more
serious than life\" (p. 133). [The game is a challenge and the dark
sphere inhabited by its players involves [a strong passion for
rules]{.mark}]{.underline} (Baudrillard, 1979). Baudrillard (1979)
[understands the gamer to [exist in a kind of hyperfreedom]{.mark} where
the arbitrariness of the program is exchanged for society and the
law]{.underline}. The game is perhaps [the]{.underline} [most poetic way
we have yet discovered to \"rid ourselves,\" he says, \"of social
conceptions of freedom\"]{.underline} (Baudrillard, 2005b, p. 55). The
spirit of gaming extends, for Baudrillard, back to well before the
arrival of the virtual and technological gamer of today. We have long
been avid devotees of games \-- of a kind of [[rules-bound uncertainty
and unpredictability]{.underline}]{.mark} we enjoy in our simulated
absence from society while engaged in any game (Baudrillard, 1990). For
Baudrillard (2001), the rules of the game \"seem to come from some other
sphere, [[with nothing to justify them]{.underline}]{.mark} \-- just
like chance, [that eternal unjustified principle\"]{.underline} (p. 90).
Ambivalence reappears here as he considers that [our [submission to
chance in the game is]{.mark}]{.underline}, at the same time, [[a way of
parodying the ethics of work, value and economy]{.underline}]{.mark}
(Baudrillard, 1979). [[The game contains the passion of illusion]{.mark}
and appearances,]{.underline} and who is more passionate today than the
gamer? (Baudrillard, 1990) For Baudrillard (2005a), \"the fundamental
passion is that of the game\" (p. 149). [This passion, in our
transpolitical era, is replacing political passions from earlier
times]{.underline}. Today, Baudrillard (1993a) says, [even \"hope
bringing movements\" (green or feminist) become part of the promotional
machine of American and Western culture]{.underline} (p. 152). [[The
cool passion of the game]{.underline}]{.mark}, an important aspect of
[its cool ambivalence]{.underline}, works to [[replace the]{.mark}
former [hot passions of politics]{.mark}]{.underline} or the body. When
we play a game, we are impassioned, says Baudrillard, by the stakes \--
not necessarily a positive or negative passion but a passion just the
same \-- the \"passion of battle,\" he calls it (Baudrillard, 2005a, p.
149). We play the game, we make progress through its network, we lose,
and we lose again; eventually we may even win \-- it is the passion of
this experience. [In the place of liberty in today\'s
society]{.underline}, Baudrillard (1979) finds instead the [game and
reminds us that [our very passion for games and rules parodies all
ideologies]{.mark} of liberty]{.underline}. The gamer thus plays for the
charm of the game, [its]{.underline} [seductiveness]{.underline}, and as
such [embraces repeatedly the catastrophe]{.underline} of losing the
game. The gamer accepts [the arbitrary rules]{.underline} of the game
[for]{.underline} what Baudrillard (1990) calls \"[ceremonial
purposes]{.underline}\" \-- [for [the ambivalent pleasure of
play]{.mark}]{.underline} and of playing [in a realm away from the
contractual and regulated legal exchanges of society]{.underline} (p.
153). For Baudrillard, [what we desire most in the game is that the
\"inexorable procession of rational connections\" of the social cease
for a while]{.underline} (p. 153). The purpose of playing the game, or
of gambling for Baudrillard, is not in believing one can win but in
escaping the system of rationality outside of the game. The old sites of
gaming, such as the casino, are now contaminated with leverless
push-button electronic games. In the loud and monotonous corners of
casino machine gaming today, the almost lifeless human prosthetic of the
game plays for money, whereas the virtual gamer at his or her computer
plays for passion. Gamers seek passion in one of its last discernable
places \-- even the passion of the virtual sex gamer is [poured into the
networks in a world where]{.underline} sex, like [politics, has been
divested of passion]{.underline}. \"From the virtual perspective the
real is only a vestige, so too are sex, work, and the body\"
(Baudrillard, 2001, p. 42). And it is from the vantage points of the
virtual that the gamer plays himself or herself into Baudrillard\'s
lens[. Our passion for games [arises]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} to a
good extent, [[from our lack of passion for anything else.]{.mark}
Politics itself has always been a game, but now it is one that
\"continues in secret indifference to its own stakes]{.underline}**\"**
(Baudrillard, 1993c, p. 6). Is the gamer the true citizen of the
postmodern? For Baudrillard (1993a), the postmodern is itself a kind of
game \-- a game with the vestiges of what has been destroyed. 2. The
Gamer and the Obsession of Our Age [The master gamer is a wizard in
virtuality]{.underline}; Baudrillard was a wizard of virtuality. Some of
his ambivalence about games and gamers no doubt has much to do with the
role of the gamer as one vital part of a system that he felt is seeking
to become increasingly virtualized. As astronauts (the explorers of a
previous age) were the white mice of a world learning to live with less
gravity, [the gamer is the experimental creature who teaches us about
life in the virtua]{.underline}l. The gamer, for Baudrillard, is an
experimental explorer in virtuality who participates in a kind of test
humanity is putting itself through in the contemporary. Baudrillard
(1997) says that when he or she is playing the game[, [the gamer ceases
to be an agent of the real and becomes a]{.mark} double [agent of the
virtual.]{.mark}]{.underline} Today, the limits of virtual reality are
pushed greatly by the demands of gamers. In the game, we pass over into
the extreme of technology and become extreme phenomena (Baudrillard,
1996). Baudrillard has long understood that we learn a great deal from
the study of extreme phenomena. [Among the lessons]{.underline} of
thinking about gamers [is that any power we possess in the virtual is
merely a virtual powe]{.underline}r (Baudrillard,1998). In a most
ambivalent way, [this virtual power mirrors the world outside of the
game, where genuine power no longer exists]{.underline}
(Baudrillard,1994). [There are no masters of a virtual universe where
power is fragile]{.underline} (Baudrillard, 2002b). We can certainly
understand what Baudrillard means by the fragility of power, even global
power in our so-called real world, following September 11, 2001. For
Baudrillard (2002a), the gamer is a traveler into our future of total
immersion in virtuality \-- as yet [[a]{.mark} kind of
[techno-tourist]{.mark} basking [in the]{.mark} sickly [artificial light
of the virtual]{.mark}.]{.underline} Here, as a visitor to what may come
after the end, the gamer enters the \"horizon of programmed reality\" in
which, for Baudrillard (2000), our human functions \-- emotions or
sexuality \-- become progressively useless (p. 37). The world of the
gamer is both an escape from the social and a passage into a clone of
the so-called real world (Baudrillard, 2002b). In the game, we adhere to
our sticky monitors (a good game \"glues\" us to the screen). With or
without our condom-like data suits (Baudrillard, 2005b), we enter the
world of the digitized and operationalized (Baudrillard, 2003), the
highest stage of simulation (Baudrillard, 2005b). But with Baudrillard[,
it is never long before the ambivalence returns and he encourages us to
wonder why, if our \"real world\" is so magnificent, we would seek to
build its virtual doubl]{.underline}e, including our own doubles to
inhabit it? Baudrillard (1995[) forces us to wonder if we prefer the
\"exile of the virtual\" to the \"catastrophe of the real]{.underline}\"
(p. 28). It is one of the sublime qualities of Baudrillard\'s writing
that he forces us to see ourselves as [occupants of an uncertain world
where the real hides behind appearances]{.underline} (Baudrillard,
1998). [[Ours is an existence of unceasing
illusion.]{.underline}]{.mark} [Against notions of a]{.underline}n
artificial [paradise of \"technicity]{.underline} and virtuality,\"
[Baudrillard]{.underline} (2000) also [urges us to preserve traces of
our illusory world\'s definitive opacity and mystery]{.underline} (p.
74). [[Before the digital]{.mark} and virtual, [we were]{.mark}
full-fledged [citizens of a world]{.mark} not of the real but [of
appearances]{.mark}, behind which the real hides]{.underline}
(Baudrillard, 2006[). Our passage into]{.underline} the screens of
[virtuality]{.underline} [is]{.underline} [merely]{.underline} one step
farther away from our world of appearances \-- already [[one step
farther away from a world we]{.mark} never \"really\"
[know]{.mark}]{.underline}. So Baudrillard understands the efforts of
the gamer to be a kind of experimental existence in a world that we can
never actually inhabit. At some future point, our \"immersion in the
machinery of the virtual, the man/machine distinction may no longer
exist,\" but at present, the failures of the gamer to remain in the game
are a hopeful sign for Baudrillard (2005b) of the insuperability of the
barriers to a virtual existence (pp. 80, 192). As he wrote near the end,
\"It is one thing to note the vanishing of the real into the virtual;
another to deny it so as to pass beyond the real and the virtual as
Nietzsche passed beyond good and evil\" (p. 162). To the question,
\"What if Baudrillard were a gamer?\" the answer is Baudrillard was not
a gamer and he could never be a digital gamer \-- they held no personal
fascination for him. The only interest the cool universe of digitality
held for him was as a writer (Baudrillard, 1993b). Like television, once
he had broken its code, so too for games, the interest was lost
(Lotringer, 2007). Baudrillard, it seems, wished to pass beyond both the
real and the virtual, and his ambivalence rests on the fact that he had
little interest in participating in either. Writing, of course, was
another matter. The world of gaming and all forms of virtuality were, by
the end, merely things he wished to pass beyond, and writing is how we
get to the next horizon. Games enter Baudrillard\'s writing so often
because of their important role in writing about our contemporary \-- a
period during which, Baudrillard felt, [we are undertaking a grand
experiment (perhaps the greatest game of all)]{.underline} to see if
anything human can truly survive. [The realm of the game is a highly
artificial realm,]{.underline} but it is merely one such realm in our
contemporary that is a time of cloning, simulation, modeling and
programming, and genetic ordeals: [Perhaps we may see this as a kind of
adventure, a heroic test: to take the artificialization of living beings
as far as possible in order to see, finally, what part of human nature
survives the greatest ordeal]{.underline}. If we discover that not
everything can be cloned, simulated, programmed, genetically and
neurologically managed, then whatever survives could be truly called
\'human\': some inalienable and indestructible human quality could
finally be identified. Of course, there is always the risk, in this
experimental adventure, that nothing will pass the test \-- that the
human will be permanently eradicated. (Baudrillard, 2000, pp. 15-16)
Conclusion And so for Baudrillard, the time of this experiment is an
uncertain one. The other side of our possible eradication is that the
virtual \-- [[the game \-- may save us from]{.mark} the perfect
crime]{.underline}, of what Baudrillard (2000) calls [[the
\"extermination by technology and virtuality of all
reality]{.mark}\"]{.underline} (p. 55). Here Baudrillard wonders if the
digital game participates merely in the ironic game of technology, of
what he calls \"[an ironic destiny of all science and all knowledge by
which the world, and the illusion of the world, are saved and
perpetuated]{.underline}\" (p. 55). Here Baudrillard was decidedly
undecided as gamers and games aroused in him a definitive ambivalence.
Baudrillard matched the ambivalence of games with an equal or greater
ambivalence of his own. Baudrillard was a writer and [[the game of the
writer]{.underline},]{.mark} from Baudrillard\'s (1993a) point of view,
[[was the game of]{.mark} indifference and
[ambivalence]{.mark}.]{.underline} For Baudrillard, notions such as
[truth, meaning, or the real can be known only locally, as partial
objects, along restricted horizons]{.underline}. [[The point
of]{.underline} [writing about a world that is enigmatic and
unintelligible is]{.underline}]{.mark} [not to add meaning to it but [to
make it even more enigmatic and more
unintelligible]{.mark}]{.underline}. As he put it, Here\... lies [the
task of philosophical thought: to go to the limit of hypotheses and
processes, even if they are catastrophic. [The only justification for
thinking]{.mark} and writing [is that it accelerates these]{.mark}
terminal [processes]{.mark}. Here, beyond the discourse of truth,
resides the poetic and enigmatic value of thinking. For, facing a world
that is unintelligible and enigmatic, our task is clear: we must make
that world even more unintelligible, even more enigmatic.]{.underline}
(Baudrillard, 2000, p. 83) [[The gamer is the ambivalent explorer of an
age experiencing]{.mark} first-hand [the immersion]{.mark}, immanence,
and immediacy [of the virtual.]{.mark}]{.underline} Baudrillard (2005b)
wonders if the gamer may even be the cusp of a new evolutionary form:
[homo fractalis]{.underline}. If t[he game]{.underline}r is not such a
form in the long run, then he or she may be remembered simply as someone
who became caught up in the obsession of our age, [\"the lack of
distinction between the real and the virtual\"]{.underline}
(Baudrillard, 2006, p. 92). Today, few are more ambivalent about our
contemporary than the gamer surrounded, as he or she is, by virtual
technologies that [propagate undecidability]{.underline} (Baudrillard,
1998[). Given that none of us really knows the rules of the \"game\"
today, indifference and ambivalence become very strategic
terrains]{.underline} for a writer (Baudrillard, 1993a). Baudrillard was
not a gamer but he shared with them a definitive ambivalence.

#### Frameworks underlying assumptions of efficiency, maximizing resource use, and technical progression engender a hyper-productive ethos that serves as a policy of self-exploitation and requires us to desire control over the Other. 

**Baudrillard, 94** \[Jean Baudrillard, detestable and ingenious, "The
Illusion of the End," 1994, Polity Press\]

This compulsive desire for immortality, for a definitive immortality,
revolves around a strange madness - the mania for what has achieved its
goal. The mania for identity - for saturation, completion, repletion.
For perfection too. **[[The lethal illusion of
perfection:]{.underline}]{.mark}** [hence these [**objects** from which
wear-and-tear, death or ageing **have been eradicated by
technology**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The compact disc. It doesn\'t wear
out, even if you use it. Terrifying, this. It\'s as though you\'d never
used it. It\'s as though you didn\'t exist. **[[If objects no longer
grow old when you touch them, you must be dead.]{.underline}]{.mark}**
There is no better way of illustrating this madness than ironically, by
the story of ~~the man~~ [walking in the rain with]{.underline} ~~his~~
[umbrella]{.underline} [under]{.underline} ~~his~~ [arm]{.underline}.
When asked why he doesn\'t open it, he replies**[: \'I don\'t like to
feel I\'ve called on all my resources]{.underline}**. This says it all.
Calling on all your resources is completely wrongheaded. To do so is to
achieve immortality, but the immortality of the totalization, addition
and repetition of yourself. Paradoxically, [calling on all your
resources is the opposite of knowing how to come to an end]{.underline}.
**[[To reach your own limits]{.underline}]{.mark}** [is no longer to
have the end at your command]{.underline}. [**It [means the abolition of
death as vital horizon]{.mark}**. It means **losing your
shadow**]{.underline}. And so it means the impossibility of jumping over
that shadow - how can you jump over your shadow when you no longer have
one? In other words, [**[if you want to live, you must not call on all
your resources]{.underline}**.]{.mark} [Yet this is the
ideal]{.underline} everywhere set before us today, by way of the
techniques of **[self-maximization]{.underline}**, of **[performance
blackmailing]{.underline}**, of **[absolute realization]{.underline}**
of the human being **[as programme]{.underline}**. The programming of
all the genetic, biological, professional, existential variants of the
individual. Going to the end of the programme, to the end of the tape!
This way you arrive at a de facto immortality merely by forgetting the
formula for stopping. Horizontal immortality, by acceleration and
inertia, by exhaustion of possibilities, with the vertical cut-off of
death no longer intervening. Even more illusory than all the
transcendent forms of immortality, since it exhibits all the signs of
material efficacy. Yet [nature provides]{.underline} us
[with]{.underline} an **[opposite example]{.underline}** [by
leaving]{.underline} **[twothirds]{.underline}** of the human genome [to
lie fallow]{.underline}. One wonders what purpose these useless genes
might serve, and why they should be forcibly decoded. What if they were
only there to meet a requirement for a degree of leeway? If all the
genes were functional, nothing would be wasted and we should be close to
a total definition. It is perhaps to avert such a catastrophe that
nature has provided this shadowy area. [**[The same goes for
language]{.underline}**: [the]{.underline}]{.mark} [mass of [floating
signifier]{.mark} is what preserves language from [calling on all its
resources]{.mark}]{.underline}[, **[which]{.underline}**]{.mark} in turn
**[[preserves human beings from]{.underline}]{.mark}** expressing
everything and the world from **[[signifying
everything]{.underline}]{.mark}**, from signifying in its totality. [Yet
this is]{.underline} precisely [the aim]{.underline} today
[with]{.underline} **[computer technology]{.underline}**, artificial
intelligence, etc. : mobilizing all the neurons, all possible senses,
and simultaneously reducing all margins, all the interstitial spaces.
The trend in physics itself is towards the reduction of this
interstitial void. It is the dream of that science to render matter
totally concrete, to wrest all its energy from it by impelling it to
limit-densities, densities artificial and monstrous. What is it all
about, then, this business of going as far as you can, exploiting all
your resources, reaching your limits? It is a fantasy of death which
leaves only the alternative of downfall and collapse. It is a strategy
for wretches, for those who have so few means they are forced to exploit
them to the full. **[[It is a policy of
self-exploitation]{.underline}]{.mark}** one would never accept if it·
were imposed by semeone else. It means [[cultivating]{.underline}
**[servitude without the presence of the other]{.underline}**]{.mark},
since each person substitutes ~~himself~~ for the other in the role of
oppressor. The pinnacle of self-inflicted servitude. [What will preserve
us from this]{.underline} **[unlimited frenzy]{.underline}**, [this
desire to **abolish the horizon as perpetual line of
flight**]{.underline}, as virtual line of flight, which must remain
virtual, but which we are precisely crossing today - towards that
\'event horizon\' beyond which nothing happens, nothing has meaning any
longer and whence not even light escapes? The intellectual field also
functions like a system of crop rotation, with ground left untilled,
fallow. It has a mortal dread of developing all its faculties. Thought
is precisely what puts a brake on ideas, which, left to themselves, tend
to spread out uncontrolled and occupy the whole of space. Ideas
proliferate like polyps or seaweed and perish by suffocating in their
own luxuriant vegetation. There is an idea horizon just as there is an
event horizon: the horizon of their death-dealing accomplishment, their
absolute realization. Thought, for its part, leaks out into the void.
History too has called on all its resources. That is why it can now only
turn around or repeat itself. It has not managed to leak out into the
void. That is why it has become interminable, leaving scope only for a
negative immortality. [**[The same goes for the
social]{.underline}**:]{.mark} [[we have]{.mark} attempted [to mine
the]{.mark} entire **[social sphere]{.mark}**]{.underline}, to express
it all, extort it all - we have tried to realize it by stripping it of
any metaphorical dimension. [This was [to kill it by
**effusion**]{.mark}]{.underline}, by [**[diluting]{.underline}**
[it]{.underline}]{.mark} [[into the **real**]{.underline}, [by snuffing
out its **idea in the real**.]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### Fairness is bad and motivates violence.

[The moral sense: [A system of norms and taboos centered]{.mark} on
intuitions of [fairness to individuals,]{.mark} loyalty to a community,
deference to legitimate authority, and the safeguarding of purity and
sanctity. The moral sense [can motivate the imposition of standards of
fairness and can render]{.mark} certain courses of [harmful action
unthinkable.]{.mark} (Unfortunately, it [can also be a cause of
violence,]{.mark} because it can [rationalize militant ideologies based
on tribalism, puritanism, and authoritarianism.]{.mark})]{.underline}

#### Participation DA -- The will to rigorous justification and testing acts as a liberal safety valve that maintains the hegemony of symbolic values. Their model of debate produces passivity and social consensus -- this should mean all their impacts are DAs to their own communicative model. This communicative fantasy makes them complicit with the worse unethical violence.

Th[ere exist causes from whose nature some effect does not
follow]{.underline}. There exist causes that preempt their own effects
from coming to be. In an early text from 1969, "Play and the Police,"
[Baudrillard]{.underline} (2001a) [speaks of a "**principle of
separation**]{.underline}." [This principle is how he rethinks
repression not through the notions of negation, aggression, or vital
forces being blocked but through the concepts of ambiance, integration,
and participation]{.underline}. **[The "unity of desire" is
broken]{.underline}**, he suggests, [into a **never ending series** of
private-sphere negotiations]{.underline}. [The question becomes **Am I
liberated? not Are we?**]{.underline} "[The separative cause, which
bursts through the unity of desire and establishes human activity across
several zones . . . is most effective at neutralizing
energies]{.underline}" (Baudrillard, 2001a, pp. 18-19). Thus, [in what
Deleuze would describe later as **the distinction between discipline and
control**, [Baudrillard]{.mark} here [posits]{.mark} a model of
**[repression through expression]{.mark}**, a [**stunting of the
drives** through the very **facilitation of those drives into new
control spaces**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [A **new ambiance permeates the
social field**]{.underline}. Th**[e masses are not repressed, no never,
they are allowed to dream]{.underline}**! [With]{.underline} reference
to Marcuse's concept of "[repressive desublimation,"
Baudrillard]{.underline} (2001a) [calls this "**the repression of desire
. . . through the emancipation of needs**]{.underline}" (p. 20). Again,
"**[[they did it, but we wanted it]{.underline}]{.mark}**." [The
separative cause [reveals how **ideology and reification operate under
neoliberalism**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Summarize it like this:
[**Exploitation is material, liberation is semiotic**. The material is
the realm of **political failure**]{.underline}; [the social is the
realm of **utopian compromise**]{.underline}. In Baudrillard, [the
principle of separation is the principle by which the two are segregated
and divided into two distinct domains, **[the one to play the fool for
the other]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The separative cause has two steps.
[To achieve some semblance of pedagogical coherence, I will telescope
them into a cause-and-effect narrative, but to be precise, Step 1 and
Step 2 both **happened at the same time**. **In Step 1**, the given
phenomenon, which exists primordially as an undivided prob- lematic
containing both progressive and reactionary political impulses, is first
separated into (a) a material modality and (b) a social
modality]{.underline}. For example, [with global warming, there is **the
material modality of carbon dioxide emissions**, automobiles and roads,
the oil industry, and so on, while at the same time there is **the
symbolic social modality of desiring clean air, "thinking green," and
the so-called awareness campaigns**]{.underline}. [The principle of
separation occasions the phenomenon first **through an alliance formed
between the progressive political impulse** and **the domain of the
social or public sphere**]{.underline}. [[A progressive moral
horizon]{.mark} of significant magnitude **invests itself in the social
sphere**]{.underline}. [This moral plane develops its own independent
logic and [will]{.mark} likely [experience **a** ]{.mark}**flourishing
[cycle of achievement and]{.mark} resolution** but **[always within the
"symbolic"]{.mark} realm [of the social]{.mark} or public
sphere**]{.underline}. **[From time to time, [small material
changes]{.mark} may be incorporated into the logic of moral resolution
[but only those minor enough not to impinge upon the superiority of the
social.]{.mark} In Step 2, [the progressive]{.mark} political impulse
[is negated]{.mark} and as negation finds its home in the domain of the
material]{.underline}**. Thus [**a [reactionary political project
blossoms]{.mark}** []{.mark}within the realm of the physical [world.
This project **realizes its ends, developing the necessary mechanisms
and infrastructures required to continue and
grow**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In Baudrillard, **[the separative cause is
this overall structure]{.underline}**. [What the separative cause
occasions, or "makes present," is the ability for **both gratuitous
exploitation and a heightened moral instinct to coexist within the same
universe**]{.underline}. It is perhaps seen best in Baudrillard's
controversial critique of sexual liberation in Part 1 of Seduction. [A
structure of both liberation and deferral, of dazzlement and insight, of
both ignorance and realization, of both expression and silence---**[all
sides unify together]{.mark} but only at the cost of a complete and
incontrovertible segregation between the symbolic and the
material**]{.underline}. [**[The progressive
stance]{.underline}**]{.mark} of the one [**[allows for the reactionary
stance of the other]{.underline}**. [The **end result is the current
state of affairs**]{.underline}]{.mark}[: [an **oil company that is**
]{.mark}**nevertheless ["green,"]{.mark}** [a world **bathed in blood
but devoted to peace**]{.mark}, a global consumer product that is still
tagged "fair trade." The separative cause occasions]{.underline}. But it
[occasions a "presence," a presence that must be crossed out or held in
suspension with quotation marks]{.underline}. [The presence occasioned
by **the separative cause is in fact an abatement of presence**, a
**lessening of being**. What it makes present is a structure of
suspension. A "subject" is the name given to those entities able to
flourish within such a structure of suspension.]{.underline} As
Baudrillard was able to see, **[most all phenomena in contemporary life
are occasioned through this "separative cause" or principle of
separation]{.underline}**. [The **environmental movement** is a perfect
example. In today's world, it is structurally impractical if not
**outright impossible to be an environmentalist in any true
sense**]{.underline}. [Imagine: [An activist drives to a rally against
global warming]{.mark}. The contradiction is clear. His actual spiritual
liberation is undercut by the tailpipe fumes of his own expression.
**His [intentions are good]{.mark}, but [there is a physical base---that
depraved automobile contraption---that creates conditions of
impossibility that are symbolically if not practically
insurmountable]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Of course, **[many today refuse
to participate in the global system of environmental exploita- tion by
casting off all worldly possessions]{.underline}**. But [this comes at
the cost of complete withdrawal from the world system, a price too high
to pay for most]{.underline}. [**[Like the computer at the heart
of]{.mark} today's [planetary organization, the costs are]{.mark} thus
[binary]{.mark} in that [they offer an all-or-nothing option, but only
an "option" insofar as the nothing is reified into material reality and
the all spins on into oblivion. This is how the separative cause
operates.]{.mark}** Other examples include the curious and no doubt
tense axis of inaction forged between the United Nations and American
foreign policy after the new millennium on issues such as Darfur peace:
**[the symbolic assertion]{.mark} on the side of the United States that,
in no uncertain terms, "[this is genocide]{.mark}**," [flanked only by
**a negation of that same claim in abandonment and blindness** within
the realm of real material commitment]{.mark}]{.underline}. Or [consider
the structural adjustment agreements of the I]{.underline}nternational
[M]{.underline}onetary [F]{.underline}und, [which travel on wings of
hope to the so-called backward economies of the globe but carry enclosed
the harshest austerity measures]{.underline}, **[leaving the infected
country with a curse of legalized deterritorialization and fiscal and
cultural subjugation for decades to come]{.underline}**. **[Exploitation
is material, liberation is semiotic]{.underline}**. [This is how the
separative cause occasions, or brings to presence, **certain phenomena
in today's global kingdom**]{.underline}. **[The democratization of Iraq
is realizable only through subjugation; clean air is realizable only
through a futures market in "pollution credits"---and around and
around]{.underline}**. **[Might this separative cause be also known by a
synonym twin, "civilization"? In Baudrillard, [the term was simply the
real. It occasions real human worlds by allowing them to come to
be]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

#### Bombarding debates with rules and information turns fairness because it makes everyone cheaters. 

**DeCoster 20**(Brendan DeCoster, Academic Advisor University of
Maryland, Janurary 7^th^ 2020, 2020 Conference Preview: "Back to
reality: Writing assigments, hyperreality, and the 'problem of
plagiarism'", ICAI,

[Recent advances in **[cheating detection have made it possible to
detect]{.mark}** a great many more **[academic integrity
violations]{.mark}** in higher education than in past times (see here;
here; and here). **[However]{.mark}**, one thing has persistently failed
to advance, and that is the type of assignment and grading used in
higher education.]{.underline} In a multitude of courses, regardless of
topic or content, students are told to write "papers" using something
like the following actual set of directions (see here and here):
***[Please submit your 10-page paper by the deadline. It must address
the main themes of our course. All papers must be in 12-point Times New
Roman font, SINGLE spaced, with 1" x 1"margins, and checked for
spelling, grammatical errors, and appropriate language. All material
referenced in the assignment must be properly cited in APA format.
Headers, pictures, graphs, and extra spacing. do not count in content
length requirements. Papers that do not meet the formatting criteria
will be downgraded significantly. It is impossible to say what course
this assignment is for.]{.underline}*** Only one sentence actually
focuses on content, while every other one is about form and formatting.
[**Just looking at these specifications, it seems like [the content
doesn't really matter as long as formatting is good]{.mark}! And this is
exactly where the [problem lies.]{.mark} As many psychologists and
sociologists have found, [when we feel like there is little connection
between what we are being asked to do and what we think we need to be
doing, we tend to feel that breaking rules and engaging in dishonest
behavior is much more acceptable]{.mark}** (see here, here, and
here).]{.underline} No matter what cheating detection techniques we use,
we will still find students cheating under such conditions, because
[**[the assignments themselves make it more likely to
happen]{.underline}**.]{.mark} It is here that a particular set of
concepts from the postmodern philosopher Jean Baudrillard have practical
implications. Baudrillard, in his book Simulacra and Simulation (1981),
spoke about the **[[situation of hyperreality-]{.underline}]{.mark}** a
situation when a representation or symbol that is no longer linked to
reality is indistinguishable from reality, or when a simulation has
become more real and important than reality**. [In such a situation,
[reality fades into the background and no longer matters.]{.mark} What
an apt description of a passing, plagiarized paper! When the [assignment
which claims to represent learning no longer has to do with
learning]{.mark}, we have entered the realm of
hyperreality.]{.underline}** Baudrillard provides four stages through
which a representation goes on the road to hyperreality as follows: a
direct correspondence between a representation and reality, the
representation becoming more important than what it still represents,
the representation no longer being linked to reality, the representation
becoming all that exists.

### Hegemony

#### They have misrepresented hegemony -- American power sustains itself through the constant spectacle of war and destruction, a sadistic attachment to ruination that can only ever lead to suicidal implosion 

**Baudrillard, 05** \[Jean, "*Pornography of War,*" Cultural Politics,
vol. 1 no. 1, pg. 23-25,\]

In the case of 9/11, [the thrilling images of a **major
event**;]{.underline} in the other, [the shaming images of something
that is the **opposite** of an **event**, a **non-event** of **obscene
banality**, the **atrocious** but **banal degradation**]{.underline} not
merely [of the **victims** but also of the amateur stage managers of
this **parody of violence**.]{.underline} For the worst thing about this
is that here [we have a **parody of violence**, a **parody of war**
itself, pornography becoming the **ultimate form** of **abjection of a
war** that is incapable of being **merely war**,]{.underline} of merely
killing, [and that is being drawn out into an
**infantile**]{.underline}, Ubuesque "[**reality show**," a desperate
**simulacrum of power**.]{.underline} These scenes are the illustration
of a [power]{.underline} that, [having reached its **extreme point**, no
longer knows what to **do with itself**, of a power now **aimless** and
**purposeless** since it has **no plausible enemy** and acts with
**total impunity**.]{.underline} [All it can do now is inflict
**gratuitous humiliation**]{.underline}, and, as we know, [the violence
we inflict on others is only ever the **expression of the violence** we
do **to ourselves**. And it can only]{.underline} humiliate itself in
the process, [**demean** and **deny** itself in a kind of **perverse
relentlessness**.]{.underline} Ignominy and sleaze are the last symptoms
of a power that no longer knows what to do with itself. [September 11th
was like a **global reaction** of all those who **no longer know what to
do with** -- and can no longer bear -- this world power]{.underline}. In
the case of the abuse inflicted on the Iraqis, it is worse still: [it is
power itself that no longer knows what to **do with itself** and can no
longer **bear itself**]{.underline}, other than in inhuman self-parody.
[These images are as **lethal for America** as the pictures of the World
Trade Center in flames.]{.underline} Yet it is not America in itself
that stands accused, and there is no point laying all this at the
Americans' door: [the infernal machine **generates its own impetus**,
freewheeling out of control in **literally suicidal acts**.]{.underline}
The [Americans' power has]{.underline} in fact [become **too much for
them**.]{.underline} They no longer have the means to exorcize it. And
we are party to that power. [It is the **whole of the West** whose bad
conscience **crystallizes** in these images; it is the **whole of the
West** that is present in the American soldiers' **sadistic outburst of
laughter;**]{.underline} just as it [is the whole of the West that is
behind the **building** of the **Israeli wall**.]{.underline} This is
the truth of these images; this is their burden: the excess of a potency
designating itself as abject and pornographic. [The **truth** of the
**images**]{.underline}, not their veracity, since, [in this situation,
whether they are **true** or **false** is beside the point. We
are]{.underline} henceforth -- and [forever -- in a **state of
uncertainty** where images are concerned. Only their **impact
counts**,]{.underline} precisely insofar as they are embedded in war.
[There isn't even a need for "**embedded" journalists** any more; it's
the **military itself** that is embedded in the image;]{.underline}
thanks to digital technology, [images are **definitively integrated into
warfare.**]{.underline} They no longer represent; [they no longer imply
either **distance** or **perception** or **judgement**]{.underline}.
They are no longer of the order of representation, or of information in
the strict sense and, as a result, [the question of whether they should
be **produced**, **reproduced**, broadcast or **banned**,
and]{.underline} even the "essential" question of [whether they are
**true** or **false**, **is "irrelevant."**]{.underline} For [images to
constitute **genuine information** they would have to be **different
from war**.]{.underline} But they have become precisely as virtual as
war today and hence their own specific violence is now superadded to the
specific violence of war. Moreover, [by their omnipresence,]{.underline}
by the rule that everything must be made visible, which now applies the
world over, images -- [our **present images** -- have become in
substance pornographic; they]{.underline} therefore [**cleave
spontaneously** to the **pornographic dimension** of **war**. There
is]{.underline} in all this, and particularly in the last Iraqi episode,
[a **justice** **immanent** in the image: he who stakes his all on the
spectacle will **die by the spectacle**. If you **want power** through
the image, be prepared to **die by the image**]{.underline} playback.
The [Americans are learning this,]{.underline} and will continue to
learn it, [by bitter experience. And this despite]{.underline} all the
"democratic" subterfuge and despite [a **despairing simulacrum** of
**transparency** commensurate with the **despairing simulacrum** of
**military power**.]{.underline} [Who committed these acts and who is
really responsible for them?]{.underline} The military higher-ups? Or
human nature, which is, as we know, brutish -- "even in a democracy"?
[The **real scandal** lies not in the torture but in]{.underline} the
perfidy of **[those who knew and remained silent]{.underline}** (or of
those who revealed it?). At any rate, [the whole of the **real
violence** is **diverted** on to the question of **openness**,
**democracy** finding a way to **restore its virtue** by **publicizing
its vices.**]{.underline}

#### The West sustains itself through the cannibalization of the misery of those in the Global South, recreating this suffering until the point of its own symbolic collapse.

**Baudrillard 94** (Jean Baudrillard, greatest living philosopher, 1994,
*The Illusion of the End*, pg. 66-70)

The end of history, being itself a catastrophe, can only be fuelled by
catastrophe. Managing the end therefore becomes synonymous with the
management of catastrophe. And, quite specifically, of that catastrophe
which is the slow extermination of the rest of the world. [We have long
denounced the capitalistic, economic exploitation of the poverty of the
\'other half of the world\']{.underline} \[l\'autre monde\]. [[We
must]{.mark} today [denounce the moral]{.mark} and sentimental
[exploitation of that poverty]{.mark} - [charity cannibalism being worse
than oppressive violence. The extraction and humanitarian reprocessing
of a destitution which has become the equivalent of oil deposits and
gold mines.]{.mark}]{.underline} The extortion of the spectacle of
poverty and, at the same time, of our charitable condescension: a
worldwide appreciated surplus of fine sentiments and bad conscience. We
should, in fact, see this not as the extraction of raw materials, but as
a waste-reprocessing enterprise. [Their destitution and our bad
conscience are, in effect, all part of the waste-products of history -
the main thing is to recycle them to produce a new energy
source.]{.underline} We have here an escalation in the psychological
balance of terror. [[World capitalist oppression is now merely the
vehicle and alibi for this other, much more ferocious, form of moral
predation]{.mark}.]{.underline} One might almost say, contrary to the
Marxist analysis, that [[material exploitation is only there to extract
that spiritual raw material that is the misery of peoples, which serves
as psychological nourishment for the rich countries and media
nourishment for our daily lives]{.mark}.]{.underline} The \'Fourth
World\' (we are no longer dealing with a \'developing\' Third World) is
once again beleaguered, this time as a catastrophe-bearing stratum. The
West is whitewashed in the reprocessing of the rest of the world as
waste and residue. [And the white world repents and seeks absolution -
it, too, the waste-product of its own history. The South is a natural
producer of raw materials, the latest of which is catastrophe. The
North, for its part, specializes in the reprocessing of raw materials
and hence also in the reprocessing of catastrophe. [Bloodsucking
protection, humanitarian interference, Medecins sans frontieres,
international solidarity]{.mark},]{.underline} etc. The last phase of
colonialism: [the New Sentimental Order is merely the latest form of the
New World Order. [Other people\'s destitution becomes our adventure
playground]{.mark}.]{.underline} Thus, [[the humanitarian offensive
aimed at the Kurds]{.mark} - a show of repentance on the part of the
Western powers after allowing Saddam Hussein to crush them - [is in
reality merely the second phase of the war]{.mark}, a phase [in which
charitable intervention finishes off the work of extermination.]{.mark}
[We are the consumers of the ever delightful spectacle of poverty and
catastrophe, and of the moving spectacle of our own efforts to alleviate
it]{.mark} (which, in fact, merely function to secure the conditions of
reproduction of the catastrophe market);]{.underline} there, at least,
in the order of moral profits, the Marxist analysis is wholly
applicable: we see to it that [extreme poverty is reproduced as a
symbolic deposit, as a fuel essential to the moral and sentimental
equilibrium of the West.]{.underline} In our defence, it might be said
that this extreme poverty was largely of our own making and it is
therefore normal that we should profit by it. There can be no finer
proof that the distress of the rest of the world is at the root of
Western power and that the spectacle of that distress is its crowning
glory than the inauguration, on the roof of the Arche de la Defense,
with a sumptuous buffet laid on by the Fondation des Droits de l\'homme,
of an exhibition of the finest photos of world poverty. Should we be
surprised that spaces are set aside in the Arche d\'Alliance\* for
universal suffering hallowed by caviar and champagne? Just as the
economic crisis of the West will not be complete so long as it can still
exploit the resources of the rest of the world, so [the symbolic crisis
will be complete only when it is no longer able to feed on the other
half\'s human and natural catastrophes (Eastern Europe, the Gulf, the
Kurds, Bangladesh, etc.). We need this drug, which serves us as an
aphrodisiac and hallucinogen. And the poor countries are the best
suppliers - as, indeed, they are of other drugs. We provide them,
through our media, with the means to exploit this paradoxical resource,
just as we give them the means to exhaust their natural resources with
our technologies. [Our whole culture lives off this catastrophic
cannibalism, relayed in cynical mode by the news media, and carried
forward in moral mode by our humanitarian aid, which is a way of
encouraging it and ensuring its continuity, just as economic aid is a
strategy for perpetuating under-development.]{.mark}]{.underline} Up to
now, the financial sacrifice has been compensated a hundredfold by the
moral gain; But when the catastrophe market itself reaches crisis point,
in accordance with the implacable logic of the market, [[when distress
becomes scarce or the marginal returns on it fall from overexploitation,
when we run out of disasters from elsewhere]{.mark} or when they can no
longer be traded like coffee or other commodities, [the West will be
forced to produce its own catastrophe]{.mark} for itself, in order to
meet its need for spectacle and that voracious appetite for symbols
which characterizes it even more than its voracious appetite for food[.
It will reach the point where it devours itself]{.mark}.]{.underline}
When we have finished sucking out the destiny of others, we shall have
to invent one for ourselves. The Great Crash, the symbolic crash, will
come in the end from us Westerners, but only when we are no longer able
to feed on the hallucinogenic misery which comes to us from the other
half of the world. Yet they do not seem keen to give up their monopoly.
The Middle East, Bangladesh, black Africa and Latin America are really
going flat out in the distress and catastrophe stakes, and thus in
providing symbolic nourishment for the rich world. They might be said to
be overdoing it: heaping earthquakes, floods, famines and ecological
disasters one upon another, and finding the means to massacre each other
most of the time. The \'disaster show\' goes on without any let-up and
our sacrificial debt to them far exceeds their economic debt. The misery
with which they generously overwhelm us is something we shall never be
able to repay. [The sacrifices we offer in return are laughable (a
tornado or two, a few tiny holocausts on the roads, the odd financial
sacrifice) and, moreover, by some infernal logic, these work out as much
greater gains for us]{.underline}, whereas our kindnesses have merely
added to the natural catastrophes another one immeasurably worse: the
demographic catastrophe, a veritable epidemic which we deplore each day
in pictures. In short, there is such distortion between North and South,
to the symbolic advantage of the South (a hundred thousand Iraqi dead
against casualties numbered in tens on our side: in every case we are
the losers), that one day everything will break down. One day, the West
will break down if we are not soon washed clean of this shame, if an
international congress of the poor countries does not very quickly
decide to share out this symbolic privilege of misery and catastrophe.
It is of course normal, since we refuse to allow the spread of nuclear
weapons, that they should refuse to allow the spread of the catastrophe
weapon. But it is not right that they should exert that monopoly
indefinitely. In any case, [[the under-developed are only so by
comparison with the Western system and its presumed success. In the
light of its assumed failure, they are not under-developed at all. They
are only so in terms of a dominant evolutionism which has always been
the worst of colonial ideologies.]{.underline}]{.mark} The argument here
is that there is a line of objective progress and everyone is supposed
to pass through its various stages (we find the same eyewash with regard
to the evolution of species and in that evolutionism which unilaterally
sanctions the superiority of the human race). [In the light of current
upheavals, which put an end to any idea of history as a linear process,
there are no longer either developed or under-developed peoples. Thus,
to encourage hope of evolution - albeit by revolution - among the poor
and to doom them, in keeping with the objective illusion of progress, to
technological salvation is a criminal absurdity.]{.underline} In actual
fact, it is their good fortune to be able to escape from evolution just
at the point when we no longer know where it is leading. In any case, a
majority of these peoples, including those of Eastern Europe, do not
seem keen to enter this evolutionist modernity, and their weight in the
balance is certainly no small factor in the West\'s repudiation of its
own history, of its own utopias and its own modernity. It might be said
that the routes of violence, historical or otherwise, are ·being turned
around and that the viruses now pass from South to North, there being
every chance that, five hundred years after America was conquered, 1992
and the end of the century will mark the comeback of the defeated and
the sudden reversal of that modernity. The sense of pride is no longer
on the side of wealth but of poverty, of those who - fortunately for
them - have nothing to repent, and may indeed glory in being privileged
in terms of catastrophes. Admittedly, this is a privilege they could
hardly renounce, even if they wished to, but natural disasters merely
reinforce the sense of guilt felt towards them by the wealthy - by those
whom God visibly scorns since he no longer even strikes them down. One
day it will be the Whites themselves who will give up their whiteness.
It is a good bet that repentance will reach its highest pitch with the
five-hundredth anniversary of the conquest of the Americas. We are going
to have to lift the curse of the defeated - but symbolically
victorious - peoples, which is insinuating itself five hundred years
later, by way of repentance, into the heart of the white race.

#### American power is in a suicidal frenzy, inflicting symbolic terror on itself both internally and externally

**Baudrillard 06** (Jean Baudrillard, greatest living philosopher, 2006,
"War Porn")

World Trade Center: shock treatment of power, humiliation inflicted on
power, but from outside. [With the images of the Baghdad prisons, it is
worse, it is the humiliation, symbolic and completely fatal, which the
world power inflicts on itself]{.underline} -- the Americans in this
particular case -- the shock treatment of shame and bad conscience. This
is what binds together the two events. Before both a worldwide violent
reaction: in the first case a feeling of wonder; in the second, a
feeling of abjection. For September 11th, the exhilarating images of a
major event; in the other, [the degrading images of something that is
the opposite of an event, a nonevent of an obscene banality, the
degradation, atrocious but banal, not only of the victims, but of the
amateur scriptwriters of this parody of violence.]{.underline} The worst
is that [it all becomes a parody of violence, a parody of the war
itself, pornography becoming the ultimate form of the abjection of war
which is unable to be simply war]{.underline}, to be simply about
killing, [and instead turns itself into a grotesque infantile
reality-show]{.underline}, in a desperate simulacrum of power. These
scenes are the illustration of a [power]{.underline} which[, reaching
its extreme point, no longer knows what to do with itself -- a power
henceforth without aim, without purpose, without a plausible enemy, and
in total impunity. It is only capable of inflicting gratuitous
humiliation and,]{.underline} as one knows, [violence inflicted on
others]{.underline} is after all only an expression of the violence
inflicted on oneself. It only manages to humiliate itself, degrade
itself and go back on its own word in a sort of unremitting perversity.
The ignominy, [the vileness is the ultimate symptom of a power that no
longer knows what to do with itself.]{.underline} September 11th was a
global reaction from all those who no longer knew what to make of this
world power and who no longer supported it. In the case of the abuse
inflicted on the Iraqis, it is worse yet: power no longer knows what to
do with itself and cannot stand itself, unless it engages in self-parody
in an inhuman manner. These images are as murderous for America as those
of the World Trade Center in flames. [Nevertheless, America in itself is
not on trial,]{.underline} and it is useless to charge the Americans:
the infernal machine exploded in literally suicidal acts. In fact, [the
Americans have been overtaken by their own power. They do not have the
means to control it. And now we are part of this power.]{.underline} The
bad conscience of the entire West is crystallized in these images. [The
whole West is contained in the burst of the sadistic laughter of the
American soldiers]{.underline}, as it is behind the construction of the
Israeli wall. [This is where the truth of these images lies; this is
what they are full of: the excessiveness of a power designating itself
as abject and pornographic. Truth but not veracity: it does not help to
know whether the images are true or false. From now on and forever we
will be uncertain about these images. Only their impact counts in the
way in which they are immersed in the war. There is no longer the need
for 'embedded' journalists because soldiers themselves are immersed in
the image --]{.underline} thanks to digital technology, the images are
definitively integrated into the war. They don't represent it anymore;
[they involve neither distance, nor perception, nor judgment. They no
longer belong to the order of representation, nor of information in a
strict sense. And, suddenly, the question of whether it is necessary to
produce, reproduce, broadcast, or prohibit them, or even the 'essential'
question of how to know if they are true or false, is 'irrelevant'. For
the images to become a source of true information, they would have to be
distinct from the war. They have become today as virtual as the war
itself, and for this reason their specific violence adds to the specific
violence of the war.]{.underline} In addition[, due to their
omnipresence, due to the prevailing rule of the world of making
everything visible, the images, our present-day images, have become
substantially pornographic.]{.underline} Spontaneously, they embrace the
pornographic face of the war. There exists in all this, in particular in
the last Iraqi episode, an immanent justice of the image: [those who
live by the spectacle will die by the spectacle. Do you want to acquire
power through the image? Then you will perish by the return of the
image.]{.underline} The Americans are having and will make of it a
bitter experience. And this in spite of all the 'democratic' subterfuges
and the hopeless simulacrum of transparency which corresponds to the
hopeless simulacrum of military power. Who committed these acts and who
is really responsible for them? Military superiors? Human nature,
bestial as one knows, 'even in democracy'? [The true scandal is no
longer in the torture, it is in the treachery of those who knew and who
said nothing (or of those who revealed it?). In any event, all real
violence is diverted by the question of transparency -- democracy trying
to make a virtue out of the disclosure of its vices.]{.underline} But
apart from all this, what is the secret of these abject scenographies?
Once again, they are an answer, beyond all the strategic and political
adventures, to the humiliation of September 11th, and they want to
answer to it by even worse humiliation -- even worse than death. Without
counting [the hoods]{.underline} which [are already a form of
decapitation]{.underline} (to which the decapitation of the American
\[Nick Berg\] corresponds obscurely), without counting the piling-up of
bodies, and the dogs, forced nudity is in itself a rape. One saw the GIs
walking the naked and chained Iraqis through the city and, in the short
story Allah Akhbar by Patrick Dekaerke, [one sees Franck, the CIA agent,
making an Arab strip, forcing him into a girdle and net stockings, and
then making him sodomize a pig, all that while taking photographs that
he will send to his village and all his close relations. Thus the other
will be exterminated symbolically.]{.underline} One sees that [the goal
of the war is not to kill or to win, but abolish the enemy,
extinguish]{.underline} (according to Canetti, I believe) [the light of
his sky.]{.underline} And, in fact, what does one want these men to
acknowledge? What is the secret one wants to extort from them? It is
quite simply the name in virtue of which they have no fear of death.
Here is the profound jealousy and the revenge of 'zero death' on those
men who are not afraid -- it is in that name that [they are inflicted
with something worse than death\....Radical shamelessness, the dishonor
of nudity, the tearing of any veil. It is always the same problem of
transparency: to tear off the veil of women or abuse men to make them
appear more naked, more obscene\.... This masquerade crowns the ignominy
of the war -- until this travesty, it was present in this most ferocious
image]{.underline} (the most ferocious for America), [because it was
most ghostly and most 'reversible': the prisoner threatened with
electrocution and, completely hooded, like a member of the Ku Klux Klan,
crucified by its ilk. It is really America that has electrocuted
itself.]{.underline}

### Information

#### We flood ourselves with news, info, communication, anything to give us a window into the world around us. But status quo journalism conspires with the commodity form of capitalist advertising producing an overload of information that drowns out [meaning.]{.underline} The resulting echo chambers destroy the possibility of a shared social and political reality that can be debated about -- making it impossible to fight climate change, pandemics, or generate shared values. 

**Morris 21** (James, Department of Journalism, City University, London,
"Simulacra in the Age of Social Media: Baudrillard as the Prophet of
Fake News," journal of communication inquiry vol 45 (3): 319-336)

**[Politics]{.underline}** (and its portrayal particularly in Western
English-speaking media) has felt like it **[underwent a sea change in
2016.]{.underline}** **[The "normal rules" no longer seemed to apply
after]{.underline}** the UK voted for **[Brexit and]{.underline}**
Donald **[Trump]{.underline}** was elected President in the USA. The
prominent phrase in this disruption, already a cliche a few months after
its emergence, was "fake news" (also known as "alternative facts" by
some on the right-hand side of the political spectrum). Pundits and
academics were soon describing the new era as "post-truth" (Ball, 2017;
d'Ancona, 2017; Davis, 2017; Fuller, 2018; McIntyre, 2018), arguing that
**[we have entered a phase where [facts are radically devalued in favour
of shallow appearances and confirmation bias]{.mark}, fuelled by the
meteoric rise in]{.underline}** our usage of **[online social
media]{.underline}** over the last decade. Some have even argued that
truth itself has been weaponised (Merrin, 2019). Social media is new
technology that didn't exist at all before the mid-1990s, and not in its
contemporary form until Facebook went beyond universities and Twitter
was launched, both in 2006. But are the phenomena of "fake news" and
"post-truth" that are allegedly the side-effect of social media really
so revolutionary? This paper argues that Jean Baudrillard was already
recognising these trends in the 1980s, based on the media in existence
back then, and so what has occurred in the 21st Century should be viewed
as a continuation of the same phenomenon. It then asks if there is
anything that journalism can do about that situation. Social Media and
the Transcendence of Reality It cannot be denied that culture has
changed with the advent of online digital media. Go back ten years and
you would not have found people entranced by their smartphone screens as
they spend increasing amounts of time on Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat
and other social networks that come and go with bewildering rapidity.
It's also evident that **[traditional news media]{.underline}** in its
multiple forms---particularly print and broadcast---**[have seen
revenues decimated by]{.underline}** the arrival of digital **[online
systems. This]{.underline}** has **[impacted]{.underline}** the
abilities of **[news organisations]{.underline}** to perform their
traditional **[role of telling truth to power.]{.underline}** However,
the cultural trends of online and social media were already evident in
electronic broadcast media throughout the 20th century. Baudrillard
argued that these technologies of communication engendered a media world
that exists in parallel to reality, breaking the traditional linguistic
relationship of sign and meaning. He talks about the image having gone
through successive phases in its evolution into 20th century media: it
is the reflection of a profound reality; it masks and denatures a
profound reality; it masks the absence of a profound reality; it has no
relation to any reality whatsoever: it is its own pure simulacrum.
(Baudrillard, 1994, p. 6) We will address the potential causes of this
situation, and whether the hypothesis is valid, later in this paper.
However, assuming it is the case, this separation of the image from
reality would pose a profound problem when media plays such an important
role in contemporary political life. Chadwick et al. (2018) have argued
that "**[[The healthy functioning of liberal democracies
has]{.underline}]{.mark}** long **[[been said to rely upon citizens
who]{.mark}se role is to [learn about the social and political world,
exchange information and]{.mark} opinions]{.underline}** with fellow
citizens, **[arrive at considered judgements about public affairs, and
[put]{.mark} these [judgments into action]{.mark}]{.underline}** as
political behaviour." But it's clear that **[[this civic information
process is not]{.mark} what has been [happening]{.mark}]{.underline}**
when citizens engage with news via social media. According to Buzzfeed's
analysis of Facebook data, **[by the time of the US election, [Facebook
users were more engaged with fake stories than real
ones.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Measuring the totals for the top 20
election stories on Facebook (this includes shares, reactions and
comments), "fake news" stories received 8.7 million engagements whilst
"true" mainstream news stories only received 7.3 million engagements
(Silverman, 2016). Here, "engagement" refers to an aggregate of clicks
through, likes, shares, comments and other interactions on the Facebook
platform. **[[This phenomenon has been cynically manipulated]{.mark} by
political movements]{.underline}** on both sides of the ideological
divide, but apparently more so by the right (or "alt- right" as it has
been come to be known), judging by the successes achieved. The infamous
"£350 million a week for the NHS" advertisement on the side of a bus
promoting a Leave vote during the UK Brexit campaign was clearly aimed
at those who share for emotional reasons without considering the facts
properly. US Republican politicians similarly aimed to harness this
phenomenon for the Trump campaign. During a CNN TV interview in 2016, US
Republican politician New Gingrich argued: "**[The current view is that
liberals have a whole set of statistics that theoretically may be right,
but it's not where human beings are]{.underline}**. . . I'll go with how
people feel, and I'll let you go with the theoreticians."1 Trump's
personal lawyer Rudi **[Giuliani went even further]{.underline}** on
August 19th, 2018, **[claiming that "Truth isn't truth.]{.underline}**"2
In terms of Baudrillard's progression of the image, this is the final
phase where **[the image bears no direct relation to reality and has
become its own pure simulacrum]{.underline}**. **[[The logic of
political messaging via news media is]{.underline}]{.mark}** no longer
about "the economy, stupid," i.e. actual material wealth, or whether
crime really is worse than it used to be. It's **[[about
how]{.underline}]{.mark}** those **[[messages fit with a pre-existing
idealised world view,]{.mark}]{.underline}** or how **[[they provoke an
emotional response]{.underline}]{.mark}** from those who engage with
them. **[[This is the only way human beings]{.mark} have found that they
[can cope with the deluge of information]{.mark}]{.underline}** they are
met with every day---**[[by focusing on what fits with how they imagine
the world]{.mark} to be, [or]{.mark} how they [want it to
be.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Baudrillard (1994) argues that: "**[We live
in a world where there is more and more information, and less and less
meaning"]{.underline}** (p. 79). He suggests three hypotheses as to why
this has occurred. The first is that **[[meaning can't keep up with the
supply of information]{.underline}]{.mark}**; the second that **[meaning
[is a separate system to information]{.mark}]{.underline}**; and the
third that **[[information actually destroys
meaning]{.underline}]{.mark}**. For example, science takes away the
meaning people find in religious belief, which explains why the
Christian right in the USA has an ongoing war with scientific
discoveries. Further than this, **[since human beings are required for
meaning, the heavily auto- mated production of information in the
computer age devoid of human involvement works in parallel, with
knock-on effects]{.underline}** we will be discussing shortly. "Fake
News" and the Tabloid Press In their insightful and thorough empirical
analysis of UK news-sharing habits, Chadwick et al. (2018) have argued
that **["democratically dysfunctional news- sharing behaviour is a
potential systemic outcome of the tabloidization of the social media
environment."]{.underline}** Their research has shown that there is a
correlation between sharing tabloid news of questionable value and
dysfunctional online behaviour such as trolling. Indeed, just as "fake
news" was more popular on Facebook than "real" mainstream news in the
run-up to the 2016 US election, the most popular story on Facebook
during the UK Brexit campaign of the same year was a factually incorrect
one from the Daily Express about the European Union planning to kill off
the National Health Service (Waterson, 2017). However, what this implies
is that the kind of **[tabloid news stories]{.underline}** that
**[promote the separation of meaning from reality]{.underline}**, which
Baudrillard discusses, existed well before the advent of online culture.
In the UK, and the USA, tabloids already had a long history of
publishing journalism of questionable factual quality, a tradition that
merely continued into tabloid-like TV news channels such as Fox News. In
the UK, the tabloid press has since then made the transition to digital
online audiences very successfully, with three of the top five sites in
terms of visitor numbers being tabloids (Chadwick et al., 2018). Sharing
**[these kinds of stories]{.underline}** follows a different logic to
civic duty. Chadwick et al. (2018) argue that: "The goals that comprise
this motivational cluster---to entertain, please or upset
others---**[are all focused on eliciting emotional
responses.]{.underline}** For these users, **[[news sharing is not about
seeking to inform]{.mark} others; the quality of the news they share
appears to be unimportant.]{.underline}** Indeed, perhaps **[[the more
sensational,]{.mark} ludicrous, or exaggerated t[he news is, the better
it fits with the motivation to disrupt the rationality and veracity upon
which political discussion must]{.mark},]{.underline}** in the final
reckoning, **[[depend."]{.mark}]{.underline}** The logic of **[[online
sharing appears to diverge from the need to inform, or debate with the
intention of finding]{.mark} a shared [consensus]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
This was predicted by Baudrillard for media in general. The **[social
[media]{.mark}]{.underline}** conversation **[[is aimed
not]{.underline}]{.mark}** so much **[i[n the direction of trying to
uncover the way the world is, but at promoting the way participants want
it to be or find the most entertaining.]{.mark} [Confirmation bias
reinforces itself]{.mark} as social media users turn away from any
messages that challenge them.]{.underline}** Chadwick et al.'s (2018)
research illustrates that: "**[[The more users engage with politically
like-minded others online, the less likely]{.mark} it is that [they will
be challenged]{.mark} for dysfunctional behaviour. Over the longer term,
these [people are less likely to encounter]{.mark} the kind of
[opposition that might make a difference]{.mark} to the quality of the
news they share."]{.underline}** The Simulacra of Confirmation
**[Political controversies accentuate this separation of a simulated
world view from its connection to a more fact-based conception of
reality.]{.underline}** Baudrillard discusses Watergate as not so much a
re-establishment of profound reality, but part of the simulacrum of
reality. This is because [**[truth suffocates under the plethora of
possible explanations for global events]{.underline}**,]{.mark} such as
the shooting down of a Malaysian airliner, the poisoning of Russian
political refugees, or the destruction of two tall buildings in New York
City. All of these events are surrounded by competing conspiracy
theories. Baudrillard (1994) asks, "Is any given bombing in Italy the
work of leftist extremists, or extreme-right provocation, or a centrist
mise-en-scene to discredit all extreme terrorists and to shore up its
own failing power, or again, is it a police-inspired scenario and a form
of blackmail to public security? All of this is simultaneously true, and
**[the search for proof, indeed [the objectivity of the facts does not
put an end to this vertigo of interpretation]{.mark}]{.underline}**" (p.
16). This scenario echoes Deleuze's concept of the fold, where the same
reality is seen in different ways depending on alternative perspectives,
none of which fully represents an underlying reality that can never be
known in its entirety (Deleuze, 1992). **[Most [people are convinced
that their perspective is the "true" one,]{.mark} and it is nearly
impossible to convince someone with an [opposing perspective]{.mark} to
change their beliefs, since these now [revolve around a system of
meaning that reinforces itself and is not directly connected to reality.
There is no common ground of information]{.mark}]{.underline}** during
online discussions from which to build a shared perspective**[, since
[arguments stem from]{.mark} beliefs and [faith, not
facts]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The controversy over **[[climate change
denial is a case in point]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Even when 97 per cent
of scientists believe that climate change is a real phenomenon,3 many
still refute its human causation. In most cases, they don't want to
listen, because believing in climate change would force them to
fundamentally alter their way of life, and those companies that rely on
this way of life for their income encourage this situation, such as
those in the fossil fuel business. Similarly, **[["anti-vaxers" continue
to cling to long-discredited research]{.mark} linking the MMR vaccine to
cases of autism.]{.underline}** Baudrillard (1994) argues that **[[this
is how we deal with]{.mark} the effect of [rampant simulation]{.mark},
where we can no longer tell whether anything we hear about in media is
true: "]{.underline}**'**[Take your desires for reality!' can be
understood as the ultimate slogan of power since in a non-referential
world, even the confusion of the reality principle and the principle of
desire is less dangerous than contagious hyperreality]{.underline}**"
(p. 22). The emergence of "deep fake" technology has further accentuated
this situation. This is artificial-intelligence-powered software that
can make famous people (or, indeed, anyone) appear to say anything you
want on video, ready to share online via social media. **[[Even video
evidence can no longer be trusted]{.mark},]{.underline}** no matter how
real it looks. Brett Nicholls (2017) has confirmed these arguments,
saying that "**[in the post-truth situation objective [facts]{.mark}
about the world [are less influential than feelings]{.mark}, beliefs and
personal opinions."]{.underline}** He also points out that the social
media detractors against Trump confidently assert "that there is a clear
difference between objective knowledge and speculative constructions."
However, Nichols sees in this a fascination with naıve realism, arguing:
"Both Trump and his detractors make precisely this claim. Both claim
they are the real America!" He then goes on to discuss four critiques of
how reality is produced: "the critique of the commodity form, the rise
of objective reality, hyperreality and integral reality," with the
latter two venturing into the world as theorised by Baudrillard. This
reads like a recent socio-political history of reality formation,
starting with Marx's view about how commodities are created from their
exchange value, which is then abstracted into monetary representation,
in oppo- sition to the use value of those items. "In this way of
thinking, capitalist exchange is less real than the materiality of
utility and social conditions of the working class" (Nicholls, 2017).
However, while "there is no doubt at all that the objective and
discoverable world exists outside systems of representation," the real
question is how we get past those systems of representation. Most of the
controversies revolving around post-structuralist and postmodernist
thinking such as Baudrillard's comes from the fact that these theorists
argue that you can never wholly escape linguistic representation.
Because, as Gadamer (2014) has argued, "Being that can be understood is
language." Nicholls understands the implications of this, arguing that
Baudrillard's concept of simulation "is not pretending" (Baudrillard,
1994), but actually "threatens the difference between the 'true' and the
'false', the 'real' and the 'imaginary'" (Baudrillard, 1994). He then
goes on to explain that: "The problem of Trumpism, from Baudrillard's
perspective as I see it, is thus not is Trump correct or incorrect on
established matters of fact (a banal problem), it is what does this
phenomenon tell us about the contemporary principle or concept of
reality itself" (Nicholls, 2017). He then ventures onto the third mode
of reality creation: hyperreality, which is not an imaginary fake but
"more real than real." The spectacle of the US presidency---and the UK
Brexit controversy---becomes the key feature. This means that Trumpism's
rebellion against the "deep state," "MSM" and "Washington elites" is a
commodified spectacle in the mode of the Frankfurt School's culture
industry. Nicholls then goes on to quote Baudrillard's famous statement
from Simulacra and Simulation that he reiterated in later work in a
slightly updated form: "it is not illusion which conceals reality. It is
reality which conceals the fact that there is none" (Baudrillard, 1997).
This destruction of the previous notions of the real, finally, leads to
the fourth mode of reality creation: integral reality. Nicholls (2017)
argues that "**[Trumpism exposes [the ungrounded nature of the political
system]{.mark} itself." This [is "inseparable from media
spectacle,"]{.mark} where "instead of standing in for an outside object,
as in reality and hyperreality, the sign itself ends up becoming the
object.]{.underline}**" This certainly rings true when you look at the
cultish belief of MAGA hat-wearing Trump supporters, or slavish
followers of "Get Brexit Done" in the UK. For Trump: "His pronouncements
do not refer to a referent, they are the thing itself. He is convinced
that there is no distinction between what is pronounced and reality."
However, **[[this is also the logic of advertising]{.mark}, a realm
that]{.underline}** it will later be argued (with Baudrillard) **[has
become [the mode of media in general and therefore
journalism]{.mark}]{.underline}** as part of that media system. Nicholls
argues that: "Branding works without irony via signs with no referent,
signs that no longer simulate." The Nike swoosh is filled with meaning,
even if it doesn't refer to anything specifically real. Similarly,
**[neither Trump nor Brexit have clear real referents, yet they mean so
much to their adherents.]{.underline}** Before we return to this theme,
we need to take a trip back into history to see how journalism cemented
its status as part of the advertising-driven entertainment industry. The
Rise of Partisan Media In the US, a key stage in the demise of news
media's direct relation to reality could be argued to be when the
Fairness Doctrine of 1949 was abolished under Ronald Reagan in 1987.
This paved the way for the totally partisan news commentators that arose
at the end of the 1980s in the USA, followed by the success of **[Fox
News]{.underline}**, which ironically **[described itself as "Fair and
Balanced," in complete contrast to the right-wing pro-Republican stance
that the news channel actually promoted]{.underline}**. This was exposed
in detail in the 2004 Robert Greenwald documentary Outfoxed: Rupert
Murdoch's War on Journalism. Greenwald shows clearly **[how [Fox
simulates the right to reply by bringing on a commentator with an
opposing view, while ensuring that the representative]{.mark} of that
[view is weak, outnumbered and]{.mark} portrays the alternative
perspective in a way that is [easily]{.mark} challenged and
[defeated]{.mark} by the Republican-friendly guests and Fox
presenters.]{.underline}** Chadwick et al. argue that UK tabloid news
media have been partisan in this way for decades and have merely
translated this style into digital media. However far Fox News has
diverged from traditional standards of journalistic integrity, the
results have fared well with viewing figures. Fox News had beaten its
rivals in this respect for 66 quarters in a row by the second quarter of
2018.4 **[[This has pressurised other news networks to follow its model
of promoting entertainment]{.mark} value and "giving viewers what they
want" [over presenting information]{.mark} the audience may not wish to
hear but is closer to "the truth."]{.underline}** This is in surprising
contrast to the ability of modern communications technology to provide a
bewildering level of access to information, which common sense might
suggest should lead to a better-informed population, not a more ignorant
one. But there are systemic reasons why the opposite is the case, which
we will turn to in the next section. Before we get to this, however, we
should ask the question whether the loss of neutrality in news media
necessarily leads to the end of objective truth. Richmond and Porpora
(2018) have argued that this comes from poststructuralist theory based
in positivism, because "positivism equates objectivity with neutrality,
and since there is no neutrality, it has been argued conversely by
poststructuralist theorists that there is no objectivity." They go on to
define this as the basis for a political dialogue where "without a
shared commitment to truth, rival factions lose their ability to say
anything persuasive to each other." They cite Donald **[Trump's promise
to "Make America Great Again" as a reference to a non-existent past
golden era that is pure simulacrum]{.underline}**, and "**[[Where
simulacra dominate, there is no validity in epistemological and
ontological claims as there is no real against which to compare
them"]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Richmond & Porpora, 2018). They then claim
that for Baudrillard this kind of situation leads to his conclusion that
"there is no way to establish what is real." Against this, Richmond and
Porpora contrast **[modernist [journalism, characterised by
objectivity]{.mark}]{.underline}**, value neutrality and "cool style."
The basis of objectivity is a trust in ontological realism, "the belief
in an ontologically objective world outside of and independent of the
analyst's perceptions or our ideas about it." This is arrived at via
epistemological realism, which claims that "when the objective world
corresponds to our thoughts about it, we have truth." This ends up in
social science and the journalism allied to it with a foundationalism
that asserts "strict adherence to their canonical research methods will
in principle generate the epistemic certainty that gets equated with
truth." This is based on the age-old fact-value distinction, where facts
can be neutral, if only they can be separated from biased values.
However, one of the main themes of poststructuralist thought is to
question whether this is possible, due to our inability to escape our
own prejudices and biases completely. The "cool style" reporting
Richmond and Porpora discuss is related to this need to maintain a
semblance of objectivity. They explain that "cool style" is a
journalistic approach "which tries to separate opinion reporting from
straight news." As we have seen from the news examples so far, the era
of social media has shown that "cool style" reporting **[[is not]{.mark}
what is most [likely to gain popularity]{.mark} in this
engagement-driven media landscape.]{.underline}** Richmond and Porpora
admit that there is "no escape from value judgement. An absolute
fact-value distinction is a myth." They then go on to cite Kuhn's work
on paradigm shifts in the world of science to show that even in this
supposedly neutral and fact-based realm, experimental results "can
always be and generally are rhetorically contested." However, they
misunderstand Foucault's related critique of how knowledge and power are
interconnected via discourse systems as implying that these are regimes
of truth that are "various, equally arbitrary, cultural constructions."
They argue that "rhetoric can also be understood following Aristotle as
a way to evaluate what is truthful in contexts where proofs or other
algorithmic procedures are lacking." But **[rhetoric is still the
underlying form of politics even in the post-truth era,]{.underline}**
and it can be argued that **[this has transferred well into the social
media age, because good rhetoric makes for engaging
entertainment.]{.underline}** Rhetoric can be spectacle too. When Trump
promises to "**[Make America Great Again,"]{.underline}** this **[is a
spectacularly powerful rhetoric]{.underline}**, and **[it drowns out any
truth about whether America was great in the first place or whether
Trump will be able to re-establish this]{.underline}** even if it was.
But it doesn't necessarily negate the possibility of truth. Before we
return to this notion, we must further delineate the current status of
journalism in the digital era. Promoting the News One of the biggest
problems for **[news is]{.underline}** that it is **[part of a spectrum
of media forms that includes entertainment]{.underline}** and
**[[news]{.mark} thereby [competes with]{.mark} those [forms for
attention as an impoverished relative.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Where
audiovisual news formats started life as the newsreels that were an
integral part of a cinema programme including A and B movies as well as
cartoons, on commercial TV news has had to vie for ratings alongside
entertainment formats. In August 2018, for example, only 12 per cent of
the TV-watching population were consuming programming in the News or
Current Affairs categories, with the rest viewing more
entertainment-focused content.5 Printed newspapers have also generally
been a commercial enterprise, even in the era of "free sheets," so have
had to market themselves to an audience that has a range of choices
about which publications to buy and read. In the current digital era,
individual stories now fight online for clicks and shares from social
media against many other types of content. Media, **[including [news,
has been subsumed]{.mark} under what can be most successfully
promoted]{.underline}** with viewers. This means that **[the
truth]{.underline}** of news **[has been downplayed in favour of its
popularity.]{.underline}** This has been the way tabloid newspapers in
the UK have built and maintained their circulation for years. Social
media has merely provided a new platform to amplify what they already
did. In the US, the end result of the removal of any central
governmental oversight over news organisations' requirement to provide
both sides of a story is epitomised by the success of Alex Jones's
**[Infowars.]{.underline}** This quasi-news organisation **[promotes
conspiracy theories as if they were journalism, with a rapacity that
seems unbelievable]{.underline}** to those outside its core readership.
It does this with some considerable commercial success. Right-wing sites
like Infowars and Breitbart, or the left-wing The Canary, owe their
success in large part to their knowledge of how to promote themselves in
the contemporary digital context. More "mainstream" news sources that
have arrived successfully in the last decade, such as Buzzfeed,
Huffington Post and Quartz, also demonstrate the same trend. This should
be seen in a more general media context where Hollywood blockbuster
movies have tended towards the spectacular rather than complex plot
formations, in a quest to lure the biggest possible audiences for each
individual release. **[The ability of news to be promoted comes first
over its truthfulness]{.underline}**, and journalism finds itself having
to consider how it can be advertised as much as whether the stories are
in the public interest. Baudrillard (1994) argues that: "**[All current
forms of activity tend towards advertising and most exhaust
themselves]{.underline}** therein. Not necessarily advertising, the kind
that is produced as such---but the form of advertising, that of a
simplified operational mode, vaguely seductive, vaguely consensual (all
the modalities are confused therein, but in an attenuated, agitated
mode)" (p. 87). **[[Politics has]{.underline}]{.mark}** also **[[been
subsumed]{.mark} to the same logic]{.underline}**, **[[since our
experience of it is primarily via news media.]{.mark} I]{.underline}**t
has been this way for most of the 20th century, with populations
controlled via propaganda, which is essentially a political form of
advertising that is generated by the same companies, such as Saatchi and
Saatchi's involvement with promoting the government of Margaret
Thatcher. In Baudrillard's (1994) words: "Propaganda becomes the
marketing and merchandising of idea-forces, of political men and parties
with their 'trade-mark image'" (p. 88). **[With so many news
organisations espousing political bias unashamedly, and successfully
building audiences as a result, politics and journalism have been
conflated into one promotional whole.]{.underline}** Data-Driven News An
integral factor in the rise of websites and social media has been the
use of data analytics to optimise online media usage. If the age of
electronic media tended towards content that lent itself to being
advertised, the shift to net- worked digital distribution has
foregrounded the power of data to influence success. This has resulted
in some very strange phenomena, where "**[[fake news
farms]{.underline}]{.mark}**" in Macedonia **[[chase right-wing
eyeballs]{.mark}]{.underline}** not because they care about promoting
right-wing politics, but **[purely [to maximise profit from Google
advertising]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Sabramanian, 2017). Essentially,
**[the Google algorithm is calling the shots, and it doesn't care who
wins an election, just how many people click]{.underline}** through.
Again, Baudrillard (1994) saw this coming, arguing that traditional
advertising was losing its power as digital technology developed: "today
this power is stolen from it by another type of language that is even
more simplified and thus more functional: the languages of computer
science" (p. 89). Data processing is taking over as advertising moves
from the creatively conceptual explosion of the 1950s advertising---the
Mad Men era---towards a method based on behavioural analysis and data
matching (Maex & Brown, 2012). Baudrillard argued: "It is information,
in the sense of data processing, that will put an end to, that is
already putting an end to the reign of advertising." Essentially**[, it
no longer matters what advertising messages mean, only how people
respond to them, and this can be user-tested and mapped in fine
detail]{.underline}**. If a blue logo provokes a better response than an
orange one, it's not important why. Only the user reaction statistics
are important. However, this doesn't mean the end of advertising per se,
merely its transformation into a data-driven activity, with a knock-on
effect on all media forms that have been influenced by advertising,
including political messages and news. **[[Propaganda is still
advertising; "fake news" is still advertising]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
Cambridge Analytica is (or was) an advertising company. But instead of
using seductive modes derived purely from creative artistry, **[the
seduction is based on what the data shows is proven to work. The
[content]{.mark} and meaning of that seduction [is
irrelevant]{.mark}]{.underline}**, so long as its numbers are better.
Try a range of ideas and run with the one that works. This is a trend
that Shoshana Zuboff (2019) has analysed in particular detail down to
its most nefarious depths, arguing that t**[he attention economy
propagated by companies such as Google and Facebook promotes user
participation so that behavioural data can be collected in order to
optimise advertising messages and nudge activity.]{.underline}** This is
why **[trying to analyse the social media popularity of a given news
story purely at the level of the information it imparts has
become]{.underline}** so **[problematic.]{.underline}** As the research
of Chadwick et al. shows, **[many [people]{.mark}]{.underline}** do not
**[[share "fake news" because]{.underline}]{.mark}** they think it's
true information, but because **[it [conforms to the logic of the
social]{.mark} media [context they inhabit]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
**[That logic revolves around grabbing attention]{.underline}** and
status within the user's social network, and posts are primarily shared
that will achieve this result. It becomes part of a dynamic of self-
promotion and personal advertising. This is not a language in the
traditional informational sense of signs referring to phenomena in the
real world. A popular Instagram user posts images to present the
appearance of a certain lifestyle. They may or may not have that
lifestyle, but it only matters that their followers believe they do.
This is very much an advertising business, and they will adjust their
activities based on analysis of what has and hasn't been successful in
the past. Although services like Instagram were not even a twinkle in
the technological eye when Baudrillard wrote these words, his
description of advertising as a mockery of language fits the
contemporary context perfectly: "It is useless to analyse advertising as
language, because something else is happening there: a doubling of
language (and also of images), to which neither linguistics nor
semiology correspond, because they function on the veritable operation
of meaning, without the slightest suspicion of this caricatural
exorbitance of all the functions of language, this opening onto an
immense field of the mockery of signs, 'consumed' as one says in their
mockery, for their mockery and the collective spectacle of their game
without stakes---just as porno is a hypertrophied fiction of sex
consumed in its mockery, for its mockery, a collective spectacle of the
inanity of sex in its baroque assumption" (Baudrillard, 1994). Can We
Get Beyond the Journalism Simulation Servers? One of the most prominent
messages from evangelists of the Internet and its concomitant digital
systems has been that they democratise both production and distribution.
In this view, everyone potentially has access to the tools for blogging,
producing videos for YouTube, and viral promotion via Facebook. New
genres have arisen as a result. The young gaming video producers of
YouTube epitomise this conceptualisation, and the hundreds of millions
of monthly viewers that some of their channels receive are testament to
the impact of what they do. However, Anita Elberse (2014) argues that
while the Internet may have given everyone the chance to distribute
their material, which fulfils the promise of digital media software
tools that allow anyone to create their own content, this doesn't
necessarily mean that everyone can now make a living creating media
online. On the contrary, Elberse argues that **[a few big media
franchises and block- buster stars are using the facilities of social
media and online distribution to aggregate bigger audiences than ever
before]{.underline}**. YouTube celebrities like PewDiePie (the most
subscribed-to YouTuber at time of writing) are few and far between, and
should be set against the literally millions of wannabes that achieve
only limited success, or none at all. Even YouTube channels with tens of
thousands of subscribers will most probably only provide enough revenue
to remain a hobby or side-line income source, not a living. Marisol
Sandoval has argued that social media organisations are no different
from the traditional media organisations that preceded them, because
they are still driven by the same monetary profit motive and drive to
build shareholder value (Sandoval, 2014). The ability of traditional UK
newspaper tabloids to become some of the most successful brands online
as well exemplifies this. Their track record for generating profit was
already proven during the print era. For most people, the experience of
the brave new consumer-producer world is primarily from a much more
passive engagement with social media than becoming a YouTube star.
Although it is possible to build considerable influence via Facebook,
Twitter, Instagram and their ilk, the owners of the networks used to
distribute this content are the real winners, as Jaron Lanier (2014)
argues in Who Owns the Future? He explains how the companies set up to
provide information or a service essentially for free (or at least more
efficiently and cheaply than what went before) are in fact repositories
for the collection of data about user behaviour. "The primary business
of digital networking has come to be the creation of ultrasecret
mega-dossiers about what others are doing, and using this information to
concentrate money and power. It doesn't matter whether the concentration
is called a social network, an insurance com- pany, a derivatives fund,
a search engine, or an online store. It's all fundamentally the same"
(Lanier, 2014). Lanier calls these mega-dossiers "siren servers" and
cites retail giant Walmart as an early example of the genre. Certainly,
Twitter in particular, due to its openly viewable nature (unlike
Facebook), is providing marketers with an unparalleled level of
real-time intelligence on public taste and reactions to events, which
can be analysed via expensive software tools such as Salesforce's
Radian6 or Meltwater Buzz. This can then be fed back into how new
marketing strategies and content are shaped. The most successful content
brands of the last few years, for example Buzzfeed, owe their success to
precisely this strategy of shaping what they produce through user
behaviour data, while "Google can individually target ads, and document
the click-throughs that follow" (Lanier, 2014). Despite the fact that
participation in these siren servers locks users into their systems,
with data contributed often being lost when an attempt is made to move
from one company's system to another, people are still expending huge
amounts of time and energy using these services to be creative and
formulate their opinions about the world. Zuboff has gone even further
than Lanier in her analysis of this, arguing that we are willingly
participating in our own enslavement to an algorithm-driven hoarding of
behavioural data, about which we know very little. Although it would be
very satisfying to see a global conspiracy behind **[the rise of "fake
news]{.underline}**," there could well be no evil wizard behind this
frustrating phe-nomenon. Instead, it **[could represent the latest phase
in the separation of media imagery from the traditional informative
function we have given to language]{.underline}**, which was discussed
earlier in this paper. **[Analysing [trends in social sharing]{.mark} so
that you can take advantage of them c[reates a massive feedback loop
where the representational content]{.mark} of what is being shared
[takes a distant second place to the popularity]{.mark} figures that
have been discovered analytically.]{.underline}** As has already been
argued, journalism, because it is a mode of communication competing for
entertainment attention like fiction film productions or TV drama, has
also shaped itself around what can be marketed. Now that this marketing
is being dominated by the real-time analysis of user-behaviour data, so
journalism is finding itself influenced by data processing as well, such
as search engine opti- misation and social media analytics. **[Simulated
news can potentially be even more successful than "real"
news]{.underline}** in this context, **[because the factuality of a
story is secondary to users' engagement with it.]{.underline}** This has
serious consequences for civic life. **[The current failure of news
organisations to cope with the increased drive towards simulation in
media poses an important question regarding political power and our
ability to do effective journalism]{.underline}** about it. David Ryfe
of The University of Iowa argues that, thanks to the circumstances
described above, we have moved from an information-centred model of
journalism to a group-centred model, where news performs a role within a
particular community of interest. He recognises that **[news now does
less to inform than affirm]{.underline}**, following emotional and
affective motivations, arguing that: "On a group-centered perspective,
new terms like representation, voice, power, and equality come to the
fore. In a group-centered world, journalists may have less interest in
providing impartial information (which members of different groups may
interpret in vastly different ways) and more in ensuring that all
relevant social groups are represented in the political process" (Ryfe,
in press). However, whilst it has become clear that relentlessly
fact-checking Donald Trump's statements on Twitter hasn't convinced
many, or even any, of his supporters to turn away from him towards more
"rational" political stances, Ryfe's suggestions don't promise a return
to traditional journalistic values of telling truth to power. Trying to
frame news so that it appeals to a tabloid-level online audience risks
that news turning into the same clickbait-chasing vacuity that it hopes
to combat. Richmond and Porpora, in contrast, propose a "critical
realism" approach to finding a truth that doesn't have to be certain.
They argue: "Without proofs in the mathematical or logical sense, we
must follow Aristotle's Rhetoric and turn to the best argument"
(Richmond & Porpora, 2018). They eventually go on to suggest that late
night comedians and satirists re-establish a more savvy, critical form
of truth that can act as an antidote to what they call "Entertainment
Politics" (Richmond & Porpora, 2018). They hope as a result that: "Truth
will be recaptured as the pivotal theoretical premise behind critical
theory and journalism itself." However, this still fits within the
hypothesis of Baudrillard's simulacra. Satire isn't necessarily
effective due to it being true, but because it's funnier than what it
critiques, or shows the absurdity of its subject matter in an amusing
way. Satire may be a rhetoric that appeals to a more "liberal" audience
but it still works at the entertainment level like the form of politics
it attempts to critique. Nicholls (2017), on the other hand, argues that
"Trump's non-dual relation- ship with the world could be disrupted by
rediscovering what Baudrillard calls the vital illusion." This aims to
take "the world for the world and not for its model" (Baudrillard,
2008), but again pushes us back to the problem of how we can escape the
fact that we can only perceive the world through our linguistic
representation of it. This doesn't appear to provide an obvious antidote
to the popularity of "integral reality" or the spectacle of politics and
its consumption through journalism and social media. As the third decade
of the 21st century approaches, **[the situation seems
grave]{.underline}** for traditional civic-minded journalism that aims
to convey information honestly to promote healthy debate in the public
interest. But realising how we got into this situation is the essential
first step towards building a way forward. Baudrillard recognised almost
40 years ago that media no longer perform the classic linguistic
function of meaningful reference to the real world. Instead, they point
towards an idealised simulacrum, an advertising-driven aspirational
utopia, but with dire implications for political life. Baudrillard
continued to argue this even in his last published work, The Agony of
Power: "**[[The most serious of all forms of self-denial]{.mark}---not
only economically or politically but metaphysically---[is the denial of
reality.]{.mark} This immense enterprise of deterrence from every
historical reference[, this strategy of discrediting, of divesting from
reality]{.mark} in the form of parody, mockery, or masquerade[, becomes
the very principle of government. The new
strategy]{.mark}]{.underline}**---and it truly is a mutation--- **[[is
the self-immolation of]{.mark} value, [of every system of
value]{.mark},]{.underline}** of self-denial, indifferentiation,
rejection and nullity as the triumphant command" (Baudrillard, 2010).
**[This excerpt could very accurately describe Donald Trump's approach
to political campaigning and government]{.underline}**, even though it
was written more than a decade before his rise to power. It's clear that
the current political turmoil is not a new phenomenon, but the current
stage of a much longer trend that predated digital media and social
networks. For decades, tabloid news in the UK has fed its readers the
"world as people want it to be." The sharing of "fake news" via social
media is merely the latest incarnation of this phenomenon. The process
may now have become dominated by the analysis of data on user behaviour,
and harnessed by populist political movements, but it's part of the same
nihilistic drive inherent in media for over a century, where truth and
meaning become subsumed to entertainment success for economic benefit.
The new element is that behavioural analytics has potentially become a
law unto itself as algorithms act in a semi-autonomous way to maximise
income for the companies with the most influential "siren servers"---the
digital technology giants.

#### The proliferation of meaning and consciousness raising rely on a fantasy of communication which implodes under its own weight. More knowledge does not change reality.

**Baudrillard 2000**
/http://www.egs.edu/faculty/jean-baudrillard/articles/simulacra-and-simulations-viii-the-implosion-of-meaning-in-the-media/

We live in a world where there is more and more information, and less
and less meaning. Consider three hypotheses.

Either information produces meaning (a negentropic factor), but cannot
make up for the brutal loss of signification in every domain. **[Despite
efforts to reinject message and content, [meaning is lost and devoured
faster than it can be reinjected]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In this case,
one must appeal to a base productivity to replace failing media. This is
the whole ideology of free speech, of media broken down into innumerable
individual cells of transmission, that is, into \"antimedia\" (pirate
radio, etc.).

Or information has nothing to do with signification. It is something
else, an operational model of another order, outside meaning and of the
circulation of meaning strictly speaking. This is Shannon\'s hypothesis:
a sphere of information that is purely functional, a technical medium
that does not imply any finality of meaning, and thus should also not be
implicated in a value judgment. A kind of code, like the genetic code:
it is what it is, it functions as it does, meaning is something else
that in a sense comes after the fact, as it does for Monod in Chance and
Necessity. In this case, there would simply be no significant relation
between the inflation of information and the deflation of meaning. Or,
very much on the contrary, there is a rigorous and necessary correlation
between the two, to the extent that information is directly destructive
of meaning and signification, or that it neutralizes them. **[The [loss
of meaning is directly linked to the dissolving, dissuasive action of
information,]{.mark} the media, and the mass media]{.underline}**.

The third hypothesis is the most interesting but flies in the face of
every commonly held opinion. **[Everywhere socialization is measured by
the exposure to media messages.]{.underline}** **[Whoever is
underexposed to the media is desocialized]{.underline}** or virtually
asocial. [**[Everywhere information is thought to produce an accelerated
circulation of meaning, a plus value of meaning homologous to the
economic one that results from the accelerated rotation of capital.
Information is thought to create communicatio]{.underline}**n]{.mark},
and even if the waste is enormous, a general consensus would have it
that nevertheless, as a whole, there be an excess of meaning, which is
redistributed in all the interstices of the social - just as consensus
would have it that material production, despite its dysfunctions and
irrationalities, opens onto an excess of wealth and social purpose.
**[We are all complicitous in [this myth]{.mark}. It [is the alpha and
omega of our modernity, without which the credibility of our social
organization would collapse]{.mark}. Well, the fact is that [it is
collapsing]{.mark}, and for this very reason: [because where we think
that information produces meaning, the opposite
occurs.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

[I**[nformation devours its own content. It devours communication and
the social]{.underline}**]{.mark}. And for two reasons.

1**[. [Rather than creating communication, it exhausts itself in the act
of staging communication. Rather than producing meaning, it exhausts
itself in the staging of meaning]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} A
gigantic process of simulation that is very familiar. The nondirective
interview, **[[speech, listeners who call in, participation at every
level, blackmail through speech:]{.mark} \"You are concerned, you are
the event]{.underline}**, etc.\" **[More and more information is invaded
by this kind of phantom content, this homeopathic grafting, this
awakening dream of communication. A circular arrangement through which
one stages the desire of the audience, the antitheater of communication,
which]{.underline}**, as one knows, **[is never anything but the
recycling in the negative of the traditional institution, the integrated
circuit of the negative[. Immense energies are deployed to hold this
simulacrum at bay, to avoid the brutal desimulation that would confront
us in the face of the obvious reality of a radical loss of
meaning]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}

It is useless to ask if it is the loss of communication that produces
this escalation in the simulacrum, or whether it is the simulacrum that
is there first for dissuasive ends, to short-circuit in advance any
possibility of communication (precession of the model that calls an end
to the real). Useless to ask which is the first term, there is none,
**[it is a circular process]{.underline}** - that of simulation, that of
the hyperreal. **[[The hyperreality of communication and of meaning.
More real than the real, that is how the real is
abolished]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[Thus not only communication but the
social functions in a closed circuit, as a lure - to which the force of
myth is attached. Belief, faith in information attach themselves to this
tautological proof that the system gives of itself by doubling the signs
of an unlocatable reality.]{.underline}**

But one can believe that this belief is as ambiguous as that which was
attached to myths in ancient societies. One both believes and doesn\'t.
One does not ask oneself, \"I know very well, but still.\" A sort of
inverse simulation in the masses, in each one of us, corresponds to this
simulation of meaning and of communication in which this system encloses
us. To this tautology of the system the masses respond with ambivalence,
to deterrence they respond with disaffection, or with an always
enigmatic belief. Myth exists, but one must guard against thinking that
people believe in it: this is the trap of critical thinking that can
only be exercised if it presupposes the naivete and stupidity of the
masses.

2\. Behind this exacerbated mise-en-scène of communication, the mass
media, **[[the pressure of information pursues an irresistible
destructuration of the social.]{.mark} [Thus information dissolves
meaning and dissolves the social,]{.mark} in a sort of nebulous state
dedicated not to a surplus of innovation]{.underline}**, but, on the
contrary, **[to total entropy.]{.underline}**\*1 Thus the media are
producers not of socialization, but of exactly the opposite, of the
implosion of the social in the masses. And this is only the macroscopic
extension of the implosion of meaning at the microscopic level of the
sign. **[This implosion should be analyzed according to]{.underline}**
McLuhan\'s formula, **[the medium is the message]{.underline}**, the
consequences of which have yet to be exhausted.

That means that **[[all contents of meaning are absorbed in the only
dominant form of the medium.]{.mark} Only the medium can make an
event]{.underline}** - whatever the contents, **[whether they are
conformist or subversive. A serious problem for all counterinformation,
pirate radios, antimedia]{.underline}**, etc. But there is something
even more serious, which McLuhan himself did not see. Because beyond
this neutralization of all content, one could still expect to manipulate
the medium in its form and to transform the real by using the impact of
the medium as form. If all the content is wiped out, there is perhaps
still a subversive, revolutionary use value of the medium as such. That
is - and this is where McLuhan\'s formula leads, pushed to its limit -
there is not only an implosion of the message in the medium, there is,
in the same movement, the implosion of the medium itself in the real,
the implosion of the medium and of the real in a sort of hyperreal
nebula, in which even the definition and distinct action of the medium
can no longer be determined.

Even the \"traditional\" status of the media themselves, characteristic
of modernity, is put in question. McLuhan\'s formula, the medium is the
message, which is the key formula of the era of simulation (the medium
is the message - the sender is the receiver - the circularity of all
poles - the end of panoptic and perspectival space - such is the alpha
and omega of our modernity), this very formula must be imagined at its
limit where, after all the contents and messages have been volatilized
in the medium, it is the medium itself that is volatilized as such.
Fundamentally, it is still the message that lends credibility to the
medium, that gives the medium its determined, distinct status as the
intermediary of communication. Without a message, the medium also falls
into the indefinite state characteristic of all our great systems of
judgment and value. A single model, whose efficacy is immediate,
simultaneously generates the message, the medium, and the \"real.\"
Finally, **[[the medium is the message not only signifies the end of the
message, but also the end of the medium.]{.mark} There are no more media
in the literal sense of the word]{.underline}** (I\'m speaking
particularly of electronic mass media) - that is, of a mediating power
between one reality and another, between one state of the real and
another. Neither in content, nor in form. Strictly, this is what
implosion signifies. The absorption of one pole into another, the
short-circuiting between poles of every differential system of meaning,
the erasure of distinct terms and oppositions, including that of the
medium and of the real - thus the impossibility of any mediation, of any
dialectical intervention between the two or from one to the other.
Circularity of all media effects. Hence the impossibility of meaning in
the literal sense of a unilateral vector that goes from one pole to
another. One must envisage this critical but original situation at its
very limit: it is the only one left us. **[[It is useless to dream of
revolution through content, useless to dream of a revelation through
form, because the medium and the real are now in a single nebula whose
truth is indecipherable.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

The fact of this implosion of contents, of the absorption of meaning, of
the evanescence of the medium itself, of the reabsorption of every
dialectic of communication in a total circularity of the model, of the
implosion of the social in the masses, may seem catastrophic and
desperate. But this is only the case in light of the idealism that
dominates our whole view of information**[. We all live by a passionate
idealism of meaning and of communication, by an idealism of
communication through meaning, and, from this perspective, [it is truly
the catastrophe of meaning that lies in wait for
us]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} But one must realize that
\"catastrophe\" has this \"catastrophic\" meaning of end and
annihilation only in relation to a linear vision of accumulation, of
productive finality, imposed on us by the system. Etymologically, the
term itself only signifies the curvature, the winding down to the bottom
of a cycle that leads to what one could call the \"horizon of the
event,\" to an impassable horizon of meaning: beyond that nothing takes
place that has meaning for us - but it suffices to get out of this
ultimatum of meaning in order for the catastrophe itself to no longer
seem like a final and nihilistic day of reckoning, such as it functions
in our contemporary imaginary.

Beyond meaning, there is the fascination that results from the
neutralization and the implosion of meaning. Beyond the horizon of the
social, there are the masses, which result from the neutralization and
the implosion of the social.

What is essential today is to evaluate this double challenge the
challenge of the masses to meaning and their silence (which is not at
all a passive resistance) - the challenge to meaning that comes from the
media and its fascination. All the marginal, alternative efforts to
revive meaning are secondary in relation to that challenge.

Evidently, there is a paradox in this inextricable conjunction of the
masses and the media: do the media neutralize meaning and produce
unformed \[informe\] or informed \[informée\] masses, or is it the
masses who victoriously resist the media by directing or absorbing all
the messages that the media produce without responding to them? Sometime
ago, in \"Requiem for the Media,\" I analyzed and condemned the media as
the institution of an irreversible model of communication without a
response. But today? This absence of a response can no longer be
understood at all as a strategy of power, but as a counterstrategy of
the masses themselves when they encounter power. What then? Are the mass
media on the side of power in the manipulation of the masses, or are
they on the side of the masses in the liquidation of meaning, in the
violence perpetrated on meaning, and in fascination? Is it the media
that induce fascination in the masses, or is it the masses who direct
the media into the spectacle? Mogadishu-Stammheim: the media make
themselves into the vehicle of the moral condemnation of terrorism and
of the exploitation of fear for political ends, but simultaneously, in
the most complete ambiguity, they propagate the brutal charm of the
terrorist act, they are themselves terrorists, insofar as they
themselves march to the tune of seduction (cf. Umberto Eco on this
eternal moral dilemma: how can one not speak of terrorism, how can one
find a good use of the media - there is none). **[The media carry
meaning and countermeaning, they manipulate in all directions at once,
nothing can control this process,]{.underline}** they are the vehicle
for the simulation internal to the system and the simulation that
destroys the system, according to an absolutely Mobian and circular
logic - and it is exactly like this. There is no alternative to this, no
logical resolution. Only a logical exacerbation and a catastrophic
resolution.

With one caution. We are face to face with this system in a double
situation and insoluble double bind - exactly like children faced with
the demands of the adult world. Children are simultaneously required to
constitute themselves as autonomous subjects, responsible, free and
conscious, and to constitute themselves as submissive, inert, obedient,
conforming objects. The child resists on all levels, and to a
contradictory demand he responds with a double strategy. To the demand
of being an object, he opposes all the practices of disobedience, of
revolt, of emancipation; in short, a total claim to subjecthood. To the
demand of being a subject he opposes, just as obstinately and
efficaciously, an object\'s resistance, that is to say, exactly the
opposite: childishness, hyperconformism, total dependence, passivity,
idiocy. Neither strategy has more objective value than the other. The
subject-resistance is today unilaterally valorized and viewed as
positive - just as **[i[n the political sphere only the practices of
freedom, emancipation, expression, and the constitution of a political
subject are seen as valuable and subversive. But this is to ignore the
equal, and without a doubt superior, impact of all the object practices,
of the renunciation of the subject position and of meaning - precisely
the practices of the masses - that we bury under the derisory terms of
alienation and passivity.]{.mark} The [liberating practices]{.mark}
respond to one of the aspects of the system, to the constant ultimatum
we are given to constitute ourselves as pure objects, but they [do not
respond at all to the]{.mark} other [demand]{.mark}, that [of
constituting ourselves as subjects, of liberating ourselves, expressing
ourselves at whatever cost, of voting, producing, deciding, speaking,
participating, playing the game]{.mark} - a form of blackmail and
ultimatum just as serious as the other, even more serious
today]{.underline}**. **[To a system whose argument is oppression and
repression, the strategic resistance is the liberating claim of
subjecthood. But this strategy is more reflective of the earlier phase
of the system, and even if we are still confronted with it, it is no
longer the strategic terrain: the current argument of the system is to
maximize speech, the maximum production of meaning. Thus [the strategic
resistance is that of the refusal of meaning]{.mark}]{.underline}** and
of the spoken word - or of the hyperconformist simulation of the very
mechanisms of the system, which is a form of refusal and of
non-reception. It is the strategy of the masses: it is equivalent to
returning to the system its own logic by doubling it, to reflecting
meaning, like a mirror, without absorbing it. This strategy (if one can
still speak of strategy) prevails today, because it was ushered in by
that phase of the system which prevails.

To choose the wrong strategy is a serious matter**[. [All the movements
that only play on liberation, emancipation, on the resurrection of a
subject of history, of the group, of the word based on \"consciousness
raising]{.mark},\" indeed a \"raising of the unconscious\" of subjects
and of the masses, [do not see that they are going in the direction of
the system, whose imperative today is precisely the overproduction and
regeneration of meaning and of speech.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

#### Their method's uncritical embrace of information processing and critical media literacy fails -- there is no outside of information and their unwitting embrace of the form of media overproliferation swamps their attempt at radical content.

Understanding Baudrillard\'s media theory begins with an examination of
some of the most well-known ideas from his work: hyperreality and the
orders of
simulacra.[3](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/10.1111/edth.12203/full#edth12203-note-0003)
In the beginning of the essay "The Precession of Simulacra," his
positing of the possible disappearance of structural reality references
the Jorge Luis Borges short story "On Exactitude in
Science."[4](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/10.1111/edth.12203/full#edth12203-note-0004)
[Here the map of an entire empire becomes so exact as to replicate
precisely the actual territory]{.underline}. **[But Baudrillard claims
that in our contemporary moment the Borges fable is
reversed]{.underline}**. That is, **[what we have now is "the map that
precedes the territory]{.underline}**," **[and instead of the real we
have "the generation by models of a real without origin or
reality]{.underline}**."[5](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/10.1111/edth.12203/full#edth12203-note-0005)
**[We have hyperreality --- the more real than real]{.underline}**.
[Hyperreality is **complicit in the disappearance of
reality**]{.underline}, that is, [reality is displaced by the
hyperreal]{.underline}. In his introduction to the second edition of
Fatal Strategies, Dominic Pettman describes it by saying, "**[Today,
reality has been swallowed up and disappears in its own hyperbole, just
as sex disappears in porn and events in the
news]{.underline}**."[6](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/10.1111/edth.12203/full#edth12203-note-0006)
The later Baudrillard announced that the real had disappeared, was
murdered, and we were left with only the hyperreal or the virtual. He
suggested that [the world was accelerating toward a fourth order of
simulacra --- the fractal order --- in which **the virtual would
completely colonize the real**]{.underline}. This description should not
be confused with other, more traditional accounts of the distinction
between the apparent and the real. **[Baudrillard famously said of the
1999 film The Matrix, written and directed by the Wachowski siblings,
that it is the sort of film the Matrix would have made about the
Matrix]{.underline}**.[7](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/10.1111/edth.12203/full#edth12203-note-0007)
In a subsequent interview he explained in more detail, "[The most
embarrassing part of the film is that the new problem posed by
simulation is confused with its classical, Platonic
treatment]{.underline}. [This is a serious
flaw]{.underline}."[8](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/10.1111/edth.12203/full#edth12203-note-0008)
His point here was that [the world of the perfect crime in which there
is no trace of the real is decidedly not the world of Plato\'s Cave or
The Matrix]{.underline}. [It is still possible to locate the distinction
between the apparent world of the images on the wall and the real world
outside of the cave or between the Matrix and the real
world]{.underline}. [Baudrillard\'s provocative claims are not meant to
describe a complete fall into illusion.]{.underline} On the contrary,
**[in the simulated world there is no more illusion]{.underline}**.
**[Everything is transparent]{.underline}**. **[Everything is
actualized]{.underline}**. And **[in the specific context of the
development of mass media, this kind of transparency amounts to a
proliferation of the screen in which nothing is hidden; a kind of
"pornography of the image]{.underline}**," Baudrillard
said.[9](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/10.1111/edth.12203/full#edth12203-note-0009)
The disappearance of reality is the result of the ways in which meaning
has become increasingly unstable through the orders of simulacra and
shifts in the relationship between the sign and the referent. [In "The
Precession of Simulacra" Baudrillard understands the image to have gone
through four phases. In the first, "it is the reflection of a basic
reality." In the second, "it masks and perverts a basic reality." "It
masks the absence of a basic reality" in the third phase, and in the
fourth "it bears no relation to any reality whatever: it is its own pure
simulacrum]{.underline}."[10](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/10.1111/edth.12203/full#edth12203-note-0010)
He describes these phases in more detail in his essay "The Orders of
Simulacra."[11](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/10.1111/edth.12203/full#edth12203-note-0011)
The first order is referred to as "the counterfeit" and it marks onset
of conspicuous consumption and fashion in the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries. Here we have the play of arbitrary signs that "have the
'appearance' of being 'bound to the world' but are abstract, referential
(re)presentations of
it."[12](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/10.1111/edth.12203/full#edth12203-note-0012)
In this order there is considerable distance between the real and the
counterfeit, leaving the reality principle intact. The second order is
associated with the onset of industrialization. Baudrillard said that
the signs characteristic of it are "crude, dull, industrial, repetitive,
echoless, functional and
efficient,"[13](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/10.1111/edth.12203/full#edth12203-note-0013)
whereas signs in the first order "were magical, diabolical, illusory ...
enchanting."[14](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/10.1111/edth.12203/full#edth12203-note-0014)
In this second order, industrial production begets repetitive signs that
begin to only refer to the difference between signifieds and not to any
external reality. Baudrillard suggested that the time period of the
second order of simulacra is much shorter than the
third.[15](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/10.1111/edth.12203/full#edth12203-note-0015)
That is, we quickly move from the serial production of second order
simulacra to the hyperreality that characterizes the third order, in
which the model is understood as the real. In the third order, according
to Baudrillard, "\[t\]he very definition of the real becomes: that of
which it is possible to give an equivalent
reproduction."[16](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/10.1111/edth.12203/full#edth12203-note-0016)
Here the sign is transformed again as representation is fully replaced
by simulation. William Pawlett puts it this way: [Simulation is distinct
from representation because signifiers lose their attachment to
signifieds (the mental "construction" of meaning inside our heads) as
meaning is generated by relations between signifiers ("models") rather
than in our reflective or "inner" dialectical thought
processes]{.underline}. Further [signs (or rather pre-modelled
signifiers) are disarticulated from referents because models do not have
referents]{.underline}.[17](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/10.1111/edth.12203/full#edth12203-note-0017)
**[In the fourth order, the virtual completely displaces the real,
leaving no trace of its disappearance]{.underline}**. [If it seems fair
to consider some of Baudrillard\'s writing to be polemical, it would be
far too hasty to, in turn, dismiss his descriptive arguments about the
world and the loss of the real. To begin with, the value of polemics in
academic writing is a matter of debate in a variety of academic
fields]{.underline}.[18](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/10.1111/edth.12203/full#edth12203-note-0018)
Perhaps more important and particular to Baudrillard\'s work, **[we
should understand polemics as necessary to his philosophical system and
constitutive of a consistency between his arguments and
method]{.underline}**. That is, **[the later Baudrillard understood that
the only possibility left for theory after the third order of simulacra
was the ironic, anagramic, pataphysical, and poetic]{.underline}**.
America and the Cool Memories series exemplified
this.[19](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/10.1111/edth.12203/full#edth12203-note-0019)
Both employ an aphoristic style that is part journal, part travelogue,
and arguably hyperbolic as well as entirely polemical. The same
stylistic elements inform Baudrillard\'s writing method in his other
works throughout the late 1980s and 1990s. This particular set of
stylistic or methodological commitments has contributed to misreadings
and dismissals. Yet, Mike Gane has noted, they are "undoubtedly
profoundly systematic and even highly
rationalistic."[20](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/10.1111/edth.12203/full#edth12203-note-0020)
Baudrillard repeatedly argued that [the late capitalist code is adept at
subsuming critique and offering it back as a set of signs to be
consumed]{.underline}. Indeed, **[this code actually encourages a
certain level of critique]{.underline}**. **[All that is left is fatal
theory or fatal strategies, which are ironic strategies]{.underline}**.
As Dominic Pettman says, **[the "strategy of opposition is now so
corrupt and paralyzed, so that it has become necessary ... to deepen
negative conditions until they
flip]{.underline}**."[21](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/10.1111/edth.12203/full#edth12203-note-0021)
Baudrillard\'s methods, then, are consistent with his arguments about
the limited possibilities for theory in a world where signs no longer
refer to the real, resulting in its "murder." **[Unlike the conventional
theorist who attempts to master her or his object, the fatal theorist
seeks to anticipate the irony of the object.]{.underline}** The Problem
of Underestimation in Critical Media Literacy Several critical pedagogy
and Marxist education scholars have been architects and/or champions of
critical media literacy as a means of educating toward the end of
resisting problematic media representations, with specific emphasis on
representations of youth. [Critical media literacy\'s foundational
understanding of contemporary media as a problem to reflect upon and
critique is aligned well with Baudrillard\'s work on media]{.underline}.
**[That being said, the methods of critical media literacy are rather
specious because they are not sufficiently animated by the problem of
form in media]{.underline}**. **[Critical media literacy promotes
teaching both teachers and youth to "deconstruct" media and to recognize
the "distortions" in its representations]{.underline}**. For example,
[an online lesson plan on critical media literacy sponsored by the
International Literacy Association claims, "By looking at the media
critically, students develop an awareness of the messages that are
portrayed through the
media]{.underline}."[22](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/10.1111/edth.12203/full#edth12203-note-0022)
**[Yet, that approach seems to be caught in the stage of Baudrillard\'s
second order of simulacra with regard to signs]{.underline}**. Douglas
Kellner and Jeff Share state that critical media literacy is meant "to
help students distinguish between connotation and denotation and
signifier and
signified."[23](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/10.1111/edth.12203/full#edth12203-note-0023)
**[But such an approach to media pedagogy does not work in the context
of Baudrillard\'s understanding of media, that is, in one that includes
the third and fourth orders of simulacra where signs have no real-world
referents and images no longer function dialectically]{.underline}**.
**[This is a world in which the real/unreal distinction has
imploded]{.underline}**. **[Simulations are not "distortions," nor can
they be "deconstructed" through drawing a clear distinction between
signifier and signified.]{.underline}**

#### Their naïve portrayal of receptive and critical audience reactions to the hulking media apparatus that structures modern life fails -- the form of media production overdetermines its content, and faith in the agency of the audience merely mystifies the situation further.

Audiences, (In)Activity, (Non)Communication [Baudrillard\'s entire
oeuvre is informed by his concern regarding the loss of symbolic
exchange]{.underline} in modernity and after. Here "**[the symbolic"
refers to that which is outside of the capitalist code and outside of
representation]{.underline}**. Baudrillard\'s use of symbolic exchange
borrows from ideas about the gift in indigenous societies as discussed
by Marcel Mauss and Georges
Bataille.[37](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/10.1111/edth.12203/full#edth12203-note-0037)
**[It refers to a kind of "privileging of an immediately actualized,
collective mode of relations and its transformative experience and
communication]{.underline}**."[38](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/10.1111/edth.12203/full#edth12203-note-0038)
[For Baudrillard this means that the world is increasingly replacing
proximal, "hot" forms of interaction with those that are "cool" and
detached, free from the potential violence of symbolic exchange but also
without the inherent rewards and meaning of actual face-to-face human
interaction]{.underline}. As William Merrin has put it, "**[our media
operates today to simulate in a safe form that lost sociality and shared
meaning functioning, along with consumption, as a means of social
control]{.underline}**."[39](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/10.1111/edth.12203/full#edth12203-note-0039)
[In place of more risky symbolic, unmediated interactions, we are now
"connected" and also socially conditioned via our interactions with
morning television talk show hosts, sports spectacles, and hyperreal
celebrities from reality television. **Communication is a modern
invention**]{.underline}, according to Baudrillard. "**[Whoever had the
idea of 'communicating' in ancient societies, in tribes, in villages, in
families?" he asked]{.underline}**. "[People don\'t need to communicate
because they just speak to one
another]{.underline}."[40](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/10.1111/edth.12203/full#edth12203-note-0040)
He stridently critiqued technological developments in communications,
particularly the cell
phone.[41](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/10.1111/edth.12203/full#edth12203-note-0041)
**[He insisted that contemporary media, for all of its purported
interactivity, effectively still communicates
unilaterally]{.underline}**. Does this suggest that he was nostalgic for
symbolic cultures (though he had never experienced them)? Doesn\'t this
new technology provide more interactivity and participation? Henry
Jenkins, Sam Ford, and Joshua Green offer a compelling history of
participatory culture in media in Spreadable Media: Creating Value and
Meaning in a Networked
Culture.[42](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/10.1111/edth.12203/full#edth12203-note-0042)
Their argument locates an adumbration of social networks in the
mid-nineteenth-century\'s Amateur Press Association, in which young
people set their own type and distributed their thoughts on politics and
culture. Starting with that early precursor, Jenkins, Ford, and Green
argue that a number of cultural phenomena have contributed to laying the
groundwork for the participatory media culture of the twenty-first
century. More specifically, [they connect Bertolt Brecht\'s vision of
the radio creating a shift from passive to active audiences in the 1930s
and Hans Magnus Enzensberger\'s prediction in 1970 that media production
would shift into the hands of the masses and this change would result in
greater participation, sharing, and mobilization]{.underline}. However,
in the essay "Requiem for the Media," **[Baudrillard used the media\'s
role in the 1968 student revolt in Paris to illustrate that the kind of
reorganization Enzensberger and Brecht imagined is impossible in mass
media.]{.underline}** **[Because the form is fundamentally connected to
a simulation model of communication, there is no way to use electronic
media to initiate or recapture some type of symbolic
interaction]{.underline}**. Thus, Baudrillard argued, **[the media\'s
coverage of the action and dissemination of the story to a mass audience
did not assist the cause of the protesters in Paris but instead denied
the students\' and workers\' revolt its own trajectory]{.underline}**.
"**[By broadcasting the events in the abstract universality of public
opinion, they imposed a sudden and inordinate development on the
movement of events; and through this forced and anticipated extension,
they deprived the original movement of its own rhythm and of its
meaning. In a word: they short-circuited
it]{.underline}**."[43](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/10.1111/edth.12203/full#edth12203-note-0043)
So perhaps Baudrillard\'s point about media\'s unilaterality survives
the rise of so-called interactive media. His critique of interactivity
in media is rooted in the notion that the "interactivity" is simply a
guise. [It could be that the newer forms of communication technology
offer only the appearance of more communication that in the end turns
out to be an efficient, convenient form of
noncommunication]{.underline}. William Merrin puts it succinctly:
**[Even when our media appear to exponentially increase communication,
this is predicated, as Baudrillard suggests, on a separation from one\'s
proximate environment and finds fulfillment only in so far as it
simulates or promises that symbolic relationship they claim to promote
but which their use actually
replaces]{.underline}**.[44](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/10.1111/edth.12203/full#edth12203-note-0044)
As Merrin goes on to point out, [even the telephone was a technological
development that in some sense assisted us in avoiding contact with
others, and so with eluding
communication]{.underline}.[45](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/10.1111/edth.12203/full#edth12203-note-0045)
**[Baudrillard is not necessarily being nostalgic]{.underline}**;
rather, **[he is unveiling a paradox]{.underline}**. We live in a world
in which the confluence of technology and communication are certainly on
the rise, resulting in new levels of a particular kind of interactivity
(that is, the simulated kind). However, proximal human relations are
largely replaced by such simulated interactivity. Of course, we do not
always choose mediated forms of interaction. The cool, detached forms of
(non)communication have not completely colonized the human face-to-face
experience. Merrin suggests, however, that this shift presents a serious
enough problem when we lack cognizance of the paradox discussed
above.[46](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/10.1111/edth.12203/full#edth12203-note-0046)
Baudrillard\'s death in 2007 limited his experience with ostensibly
increased media interactivity to call-in radio and television shows that
seem to allow the audience to participate and respond to media messages.
[He understood this to be no kind of interactivity at all because
audience responses in cases such as these are always
precoded]{.underline}. **[They are not openly interactive because only
certain kinds of responses are considered for airing and even then the
audience\'s participation is completely screened and/or
edited]{.underline}**. **[Thus these "interactions," in form, shape, and
content, are effectively determined ahead of time]{.underline}**. But
what should we make of the fact that Baudrillard\'s ideas about precoded
responses to media seem to be less informed by the rise of Internet
technologies in which interactivity can take on a more private or
sometimes bilateral form? First, Baudrillard was rather prescient with
regard to the trajectory of such technologies, as the discussion of
"Telemorphosis" in the next section will establish. Second, and perhaps
more important, **[the same argument that Baudrillard used against
technological developments in media with which he had firsthand
experience applies equally to the ostensibly more interactive
communication technologies currently available]{.underline}**. **[They
may seem to increase communication and interactivity but are instead
increasing a simulation of proximal relations]{.underline}**. **[All of
this reveals the first shortcoming of critical media literacy related to
underestimating the problem of form]{.underline}**. **[Pedagogy based on
critical media literacy operates with a commitment to active audience
theories that Baudrillard\'s media theory calls into
question.]{.underline}**

### NATO

#### NATO's battle-rhythm can target anything and make it into a folder forcing it to disappear from the real because the folder lives in the future- the planned targeting of militaries deem that this target will no longer be existent in the future as they envelop the entire realm of the real. War is not dynamic- it is a constantly occurring yet pre-planned script.

After the Afghanistan Disaster, [NATO Is Already Planning the Next
War]{.underline} The [occupation of Afghanistan was a
disaster]{.underline} --- but the [US's failure is already being used to
justify even longer]{.underline} "[humanitarian
interventions]{.underline}." As [after Vietnam]{.underline},
[military]{.underline} men [are using scenes of disorderly departure to
prepare the ground for the next war]{.underline}. In Tim O'Brien's
celebrated anti--Vietnam War novel Going After Cacciato, a deserter is
pursued by the narrator and his squadmates in a fever dream. The chase
breaks out of the southeast Asian country, taking the war on tour around
the world. Indeed, after the last helicopter left Saigon, the [Vietnam
War's legacy did pursue the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
across multiple continents. [Defeat in Vietnam haunted the]{.underline}
military and [security establishment]{.underline} --- but [they bounced
back strong]{.underline}er. [The U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates' [conventional war machine was
overhauled]{.underline}, as [the Cold War entered a new
phase]{.underline}. The [inflexible Pentagon buckled enough for theories
of maneuver warfare to take root that tried to learn from
insurgents]{.underline}. This was combined with a new technological plan
for aerial supremacy, realized in Vietnam through blunt instruments like
mass defoliation and carpet bombing. In [the]{.underline} 1991 [Gulf
War]{.underline}, this finally [produced a devastatingly effective war
machine involving]{.underline} satellite technology, fast-moving armored
columns with close air support, more destructive and accurate munitions,
and [the ability to manipulate the broadcast media]{.underline} (e.g.
[through providing weapon]{.underline} camera [footage]{.underline}) [to
present an ideal]{.underline}ized [version of]{.underline} the
[war]{.underline}. [This gap between image and reality led]{.underline}
sociologist and philosopher Jean [Baudrillard to declare
that]{.underline} "[The]{.underline} Gulf [War Did
N]{.underline}o[t]{.underline} [Take Place]{.underline}." Military
innovation following the defeat in Vietnam was combined with
geopolitical responses. Struggling in Asia, [the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [ramped up attempts to retain control]{.underline}
in its own backyard. [This meant embarking on]{.underline} a renewed
decade of sponsoring right-wing [terror]{.underline} in South America,
adapting and deploying the lessons from torture and murder projects in
Vietnam like the infamous Phoenix Program. At the same time, the United
States took steps to safeguard its post-1975 position in the rest of
Asia. [As communists began to tip the balance of power in
Afghanistan]{.underline} during 1978's Saur Revolution, [the US
intervened]{.underline} to undermine the Afghan state and support the
reactionaries' insurgency before the full-scale Soviet intervention
arrived. Taking a more hands-off approach, it attempted to remotely turn
the country into the Soviets' own Vietnam, empowering local proxies,
many of whom later fought for the Taliban, working with and through
regional powers like Pakistan, and developing key tactical headaches for
opponents like providing anti-air missiles. (Some scholarship argues
that the impact of the latter is overrated --- attributing the
insurgents' success primarily to their organizational form, a reading
supported by recent events.) Albeit with some trepidation, liberal
screenwriter Aaron Sorkin still treated this as an essentially heroic
episode in his 2007 Charlie Wilson's War. [NATO's defeat in Afghanistan
will have similar long]{.underline}-range [implications]{.underline}.
Vietnam comparisons like the Wall Street Journal breathlessly describing
Kabul as "Saigon on steroids" are overwrought, but there are some
broader similarities. As in Vietnam, [the spectacle of departure is
being made into a case for developing the power to never experience
defeat again]{.underline}. As in Vietnam, [refugees leaving the
country]{.underline} in droves [are seized]{.underline} on
[by]{.underline} "[humanitarian intervention]{.underline}ists" [as an
argument for more muscular policy]{.underline}, even if [the great
powers are doing]{.underline} almost [nothing about refugees beyond
trying to stop them]{.underline}, or [creating more of
them.]{.underline} And as in Vietnam, defeat in Afghanistan will
contribute to a reassessment of how best to wield military power. In
short, [they are already preparing for the next war]{.underline}.
Explaining Failure The [stated motives]{.underline} for the Afghan
[War]{.underline} --- catching Osama Bin Laden, then defeating the
Taliban, then building a stable country with Western-style institutions
--- [were in constant flux]{.underline}. But [with political direction
confused]{.underline}, a similar choose-your-own-adventure approach took
place in warfighting as well. Military traditionalists who believed that
the army was there to kill "bad guys" and little more often found
themselves arguing for a less expensive and less protracted war than
liberal [militarists]{.underline} who [wanted]{.underline} to use an
[expanded army to enforce their conception of the good]{.underline}.
[These contradictions persisted]{.underline}. The 2010 [troop surge
escalated and expanded the war]{.underline}, supposedly [to bring it to
a swifter end]{.underline}. [Units in some areas would focus on
battlefield aggression]{.underline}, [others on]{.underline} "[hearts
and minds]{.underline}." Field Manual 3-24, the counterinsurgency (COIN)
document circulated by David Petraeus and James Mattis became gospel.
[The]{.underline} Commanders' [Emergency Response Program involved
a]{.underline}n unprecedented [militarization of aid]{.underline}, [with
\$2.6 billion]{.underline} disbursed between 2004 and 2011
[through]{.underline} US field commanders identifying and [funding
schemes designed to win over local populations]{.underline}. [Such
approaches squared poorly with the torture regime]{.underline} at Bagram
Air Base and beyond (extensively documented by Human Rights Watch
\[HRW\]). They were also belied by the routine drone strikes on civilian
targets including a Médecins Sans Frontières hospital in 2015, and a
number of incidents of individual or unit-level criminality from the
Panjwai massacre to recent revelations about Australian special forces.
The military utterly failed to build sustainable partners. Between
strategic confusion about which Afghan groups to support; stories of
Afghan rivals accusing each other of Taliban links; unpleasant or
unreliable figures backed by US forces through various supposed
lesser-evilism strategies; and even reports of farmers making pretend
Taliban camps to collect the scrap metal from US airstrikes, identifying
friend from foe became impossible. From combat troops to Donald
Rumsfeld, the same exasperation was repeatedly voiced; "[we have no idea
who the bad guys are]{.underline}." [Joe Biden's story]{.underline} of
Afghan National Army (ANA) recalcitrance [is unfair]{.underline} ---
[Afghan troops]{.underline} fought and [died in huge
numbers]{.underline} and miserable circumstances, comprising the
overwhelming majority of overall allied military death figures. But [it
was incapable of even paying its troops and collapsed instantly
without]{.underline} its [America]{.underline}n umbrella. Finally,
[Taliban]{.underline} forces advanced into Kabul with hundreds of
captured US military vehicles and even stolen biometric tools that
[could provide access to data the military collected on its Afghan
staff]{.underline} and contractors. The [civilian op]{.underline}eration
[didn't go]{.underline} much [better]{.underline}. Veteran war reporter
Rajiv Chandrasekaran provides an enlightening account of how
[billions]{.underline} in public money [were pumped into farming to
discourage opium growth and reduce farmers' dependence on the
Taliban]{.underline} with little to show for it. In one case, [a seed
distribution program was derailed]{.underline} swiftly [by]{.underline}
United States Agency for International Development
([USAID]{.underline})['s]{.underline} [strange ideological obsession
with forcing farmers]{.underline} to grow melons rather than the cotton
they were used to. This obsession arose in part from a capitalist
aversion to the state-run cotton gin (which conveniently ignored the
involvement of vast quantities of US state money and power in shaping
outcomes.) USAID's analysis claimed the gin was inefficient and
unproductive. Unfortunately, the analysis was based on figures which
accidentally substituted kilos for pounds and confused refined and
unrefined cotton. Andrew Mackay, [the British officer who
directed]{.underline} an effective [2007 offensive in Musa
Qala]{.underline} but [resigned]{.underline} after just months as a
divisional commander, would [brand the British]{.underline} Ministry of
Defence ([MoD]{.underline}) "[institutionally incapable]{.underline}"
[of warfighting]{.underline} and influence-wielding. [US]{.underline}
three-star [general]{.underline} and Bush/Obama adviser Doug Lute
meanwhile privately [posed a question which would never be
answered:]{.underline} "[What are we trying to do here?]{.underline}"
Simon Akam's The Changing of the Guard --- [a]{.underline} forthcoming
[book fiercely critical of military leadership in Afghanistan and
Iraq]{.underline} --- has [prompted frightening intervention in the
publishing process]{.underline}, [with]{.underline} Penguin Random
[House canceling Akam's contract and removing his advance after he
refused to be subject to MoD sign-off]{.underline}. There was a period
when it was widely accepted in military circles that the chaos of Iraq
and Afghanistan was an inevitable result of maintaining an unpopular
long-term occupation without viable local partners, outside the usual
sphere of influence, and with few cultural ties. But it is easy to pick
targets for blame, whether it's coalition partners blaming each other
(as in the 2009 row over allegations of Italian troops bribing the
Taliban), blaming the ANA (who can't really fight back in Western
media), hawks blaming doves (who had no actual control over anything),
or the Atlantic's op-ed pages blaming you. If some group or individual's
ineptitude or malice is to blame, then things could have gone
differently. And for some commentators, if things could have gone
differently, then one last heavily armed heave in Afghanistan could
work. If things could have gone differently, then the onus is on the
military to adapt, à la Vietnam. The United States' post-2014 army
shakeup and the UK's current Defence Review both engage with new
concepts such as regionally aligned forces --- in other words,
[maintaining a permanent military presence in countries across the globe
so armies have the cultural and geographical know-how to start and scale
warfare anywhere]{.underline}. The British document explicitly calls for
more, longer, and bigger deployments. The [drone warfare machinery and
tactics]{.underline} developed in Afghanistan remain at the heart of
strategic thinking --- the contemporary answer to the massive "strategic
bomber" wings of the first Cold War. [Various other]{.underline} "new
toy" [strategies]{.underline} from space domination to new air combat
systems are [also floated as means of avoiding future
defeat]{.underline}. In sum, [there is a growing]{.underline} implicit
[account of the Afghan defeat that focuses on correcting
past]{.underline} "[mistakes]{.underline}" through hybrid tactics,
cultural depth, leaner use of force, [and technology to aid both
intelligence-gathering and offensive action]{.underline}. But [weapons
are little but inert objects until they are wielded in a specific way in
the pursuit of specific aims]{.underline}. And [the broad political and
strategic conclusions drawn from the Afghan War are even more concerning
than the straightforwardly military ones.]{.underline} Blackout
"[Technically]{.underline}, [this isn't a war]{.underline}, boss." "[No?
Soldiers. Bombs. It does feel quite warry]{.underline}." [Around the
time]{.underline} [this exchange was aired in]{.underline} Bluestone 42,
[the British comedy about a bomb disposal unit in Afghanistan which this
exchange comes from]{.underline}, [American and British
op]{.underline}eration[s were formally ending]{.underline}. But [sixteen
thousand NATO personnel were to remain deployed across
Afghanistan]{.underline}, and [there is enough material on Green Beret
op]{.underline}erations [alone]{.underline} since 2014 to fill war
reporter Jessica Donati's recently-released book. [Most viewers in the
West]{.underline} who [are not directly imbricated in the
war]{.underline} have [largely experienced it as a background
hum]{.underline}. [It has conferred upon us a siege
mentality]{.underline}, [a vague sense of unease and
threat]{.underline}, [but never the sense of a full-blown
war]{.underline}. [It]{.underline} has even [generated surprisingly
little war fiction even of the propagandistic kind]{.underline}, and
what does exist has tended to zero in on vignettes, whether the
kitchen-sink British grit of Kajaki or Hollywood's Zero Dark Thirty,
rather than trying to define the war in the sense that post-Vietnam
cultural output did. In short, [despite more access to detailed and
constant info]{.underline}rmation than at any point in history, viewing
[publics in the West have either been told that the war is not happening
or been given a]{.underline} deeply [disingenuous account of
it]{.underline}. [As Baudrillard]{.underline}'s Gulf War essay [put
it]{.underline}, "[no one will hold this]{.underline} expert or general
or that [intellectual for hire to account for the]{.underline} idiocies
or [absurdities proffered]{.underline} the day before, since these will
be erased by those of the following day." [Politicians remain
ill-informed]{.underline}; a British MP this week raised concerns about
the Taliban potentially making Afghanistan a safe haven for ISIS --- a
group they have been shooting at for several years. If nothing else
[this lack of]{.underline} good [info]{.underline}rmation [is
because]{.underline} throughout the Afghan War, [the
powers]{.underline}-that-be [lie]{.underline}d
[consistently]{.underline}, unabashedly, [and industrially]{.underline}.
From [the 2010 WikiLeaks]{.underline} documents, which [revealed the
cover-up of hundreds of civilian deaths]{.underline} and injuries, to
[the 2019 Afghanistan Papers]{.underline} in which successive [figures
across the]{.underline} military and civilian [hierarchies frankly and
repeatedly admit they have no idea what they are doing]{.underline}
while reporting boundless progress to the public. But [deception
aside]{.underline}, the [disastrous nature of the conflict was always
clear]{.underline}. Too [few journalists took those responsible to
task]{.underline}, and those who did found it hard to make their stories
stick. And of course, [more efficient procedures for controlling the
media are another legacy]{.underline} of the post-Vietnam learning
period. [This con was as efficient off the battlefield as on
it]{.underline}. Routinely, [wells would be built and torn down a day
later so the contractors could get themselves hired to repair
it]{.underline}, [schools would be opened with no teachers]{.underline}
to staff them, and [a great many press releases about progress would be
churned out]{.underline} from these events. Insofar [as the war was
presented at all]{.underline}, [portrayals often took the form of an aid
mission in uniform]{.underline}. Undoubtedly huge sums of aid money were
spent --- but Afghanistan remains among the world's poorest countries,
with poverty having risen. The combination of [lying and downplaying
represent a clear strategy]{.underline}. [Invisible wars do not
generate]{.underline} protests or [scrutiny]{.underline}. [This will
inform future policy]{.underline} too. The [use of small special forces
op]{.underline}eration[s not subject to public scrutiny or]{.underline}
parliamentary [accountability has been rising]{.underline} and will
continue to. [The]{.underline} British [government]{.underline} are
[openly preparing for a series of]{.underline} "[permanent]{.underline}"
[conflicts operating]{.underline} "[just below the level of
war]{.underline}." [The]{.underline} millennium's [first Forever War
seems over]{.underline}, [but many of its children have yet to be
born]{.underline}. War Forever and Everywhere [Vietnam was a test bed
for tech]{.underline}nologies of force and power that would shape future
conflict. [Afghanistan has been a test bed for redefining war
itself]{.underline}. A [recent account by]{.underline} a former
[Pentagon analyst during the Afghan War]{.underline} period [paints an
unsettling portrait of collapsing legal distinctions between war and
nonwar]{.underline}. For the first time, [the state maintained specific
kill lists of individuals presumed but not proven guilty]{.underline},
[marked for extrajudicial assassination even in states with which the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [is not at war]{.underline}.
The [White House's lawfare documented by HRW]{.underline} and [brought
frighteningly to life]{.underline} in Adam McKay's Dick Cheney biopic
Vice [provides blueprints and strat]{.underline}egie[s for authorizing
torture]{.underline} and tearing through laws, rules, and norms. These
days, much commentary talks about the rules-based order having changed,
and Western powers needing to catch up lest China and Russia exploit
such confusion. Of course [rules are now more contested]{.underline} in
a more multipolar world, but [such commentary tends to ignore how US-led
powers ripped up the rules in Afghanistan]{.underline}, [and granted
themselves]{.underline} both the political and legal space and technical
[capability to strike at any time and in any place without
accountability]{.underline} either to other countries or their own
voters. Conventional warfare, [information warfare]{.underline}, and
economic rivalry [now exists in a continuum without
boundaries]{.underline}, and an increasing multidisciplinary school of
thought is beginning to [regard]{.underline} essentially [everything as
warfare]{.underline}. There was always a military-industrial complex,
but in Afghanistan it struck gold, with a war that cost \$300
million-a-day in public money delivering 1,200 percent returns on stocks
to the biggest arms conglomerates. (Meanwhile [the outsourcing of the
war is now being used an excuse not to settle refugees]{.underline}
employed by contractors.) After Afghanistan [there is now military
involvement in everything from producing games and fiction to training
judges]{.underline}. The Afghan War locked aid and force tighter
together than ever before, and [the]{.underline} UK [government now
talks more openly than ever about aid as a geopolitical
tool]{.underline} in general terms. [States]{.underline} always had the
ability to trade at gunpoint --- but not to [use counterterrorism rubric
to access all internet traffic]{.underline} coming in and out of the
United States, or to block access to global financial systems like the
SWIFT interbank loan system not only from hostile states but from any of
their trading partners. Every power always attempted strategic
dominance, but not [the development of a global
techno]{.underline}logical [panopticon capable of identifying and
weaponizing]{.underline} almost [anything]{.underline}. [Afghanistan and
Iraq]{.underline} have not only [defined the foreign wars of the
future]{.underline}, but have [also defined the transformation of
Western cities and borders into battle spaces]{.underline}. The "[war on
terror]{.underline}" [understood the enemy as]{.underline} essentially
[the same everywhere]{.underline}, meaning [a continual exchange of
ideas between the battlefield and]{.underline} the [home]{.underline}
front. [Surveillance tech]{.underline}nology [used to filter supposed
combatants from supposed civilians in war is now an everyday feature of
domestic policing]{.underline}. The [contractors that made tens of
billions from]{.underline} the [Afghanistan]{.underline} war [now sell
their battle-tested wares]{.underline}, [from AI and
biometrics]{.underline} to drones [and straightforward killing
machines]{.underline}, [to police and border forces]{.underline}. In The
New Military Urbanism, Stephen Graham has reproduced an advert for
thermal sensors from the mid-2000s which claims that their products
would "have your back whether in Baghdad or Baton Rouge." On one side of
the image is an Army gunship, on the other a police helicopter. [The
forever war has followed us home]{.underline}.

### Nuclear War

#### Concern over nuclear weapons reduces life to a state of mere survival without value and increases the likelihood of nuclear war. Prefer the silent majority's indifference to nuclear weapons. 

**Baudrillard** **10** (Jean, Ph.D. in sociology, *America*, trans.
Chris Turner, Verso, pp. 42-44)

[**Everywhere [survival has become a burning issue]{.mark}, perhaps [by
some obscure weariness of life]{.mark} or a collective desire for
catastrophe** (though we should not take all this too
seriously:]{.underline} **[it is also a playing at
catastrophe)]{.underline}**. Certainly, this whole panoply of survival
issues - dieting, ecology, saving the sequoias, seals or the human
race - tends to prove that we are very much alive (just as all imaginary
fairy-tales tend to prove that the real world is very real).
**[[But]{.mark} this is not so certain, for not only is the fact of
living not really well-attested, but the paradox of this society is that
[you cannot even die]{.mark} in it any more [since you are already
dead]{.mark}]{.underline}**. . . This is real suspense. [**And it is not
simply an effect of living in the nuclear age, but derives from [the
ease with which we now live,]{.mark} which [makes survivors of us all.
If the bomb drops, we shall neither have the time to die nor any
awareness of dying. But]{.mark} already [in our hyper-protected society
we no longer have any awareness of death, since we have subtly passed
over into a state where life is excessively easy]{.mark}.** The
holocaust created an anticipatory form of such a condition. What the
[inmates of the concentration camps were deprived of]{.mark} was [the
very possibility of having control of their own deaths,]{.mark} of
playing, even gambling with their own deaths, making their deaths a
sacrifice: they were robbed of power over their own deaths.]{.underline}
[[And this is what is happening to all of us, in slow, homeopathic
doses]{.mark}, by virtue of the very development of our systems. The
explosions and the extermination ([Auschwitz and Hiroshima) still go on,
though they have]{.mark} simply [taken on a purulent, endemic
form]{.mark}. The chain reaction continues nonetheless, the contagion,
the unfolding of the viral and bacteriological process. The end of
history was precisely the inauguration of this chain reaction. **[The
obsessive desire for survival (and not for life) is a symptom of this
state of affairs and doubtless also the most worrying sign of the
degradation of the species.]{.mark} If you think about the forms that
desire currently takes -[antinuclear shelters]{.mark}**]{.underline}[,
[cryogenization, high-pressure therapy]{.underline}]{.mark} [- you see
that they a[re exactly the forms of extermination]{.mark}]{.underline}[.
**[To avoid dying, one chooses to withdraw into some protective bubble
or other]{.underline}**.]{.mark} [In this light, **[we should take it as
a reassuring sign that people lost interest in antinuclear protection so
quickly]{.mark}** (the shelter market has become a mere prestige market,
like the market for artworks or luxury yachts). It seems that **p[eople
have become tired of nuclear blackmail and decided not to give in to it,
leaving the threat of destruction hanging in mid-air over
them]{.mark}**, perhaps with an obscure sense of how unreal it
is.]{.underline} **[A fine example of a vital reaction disguised as
resignation. ['If we have to die, better to die in the open air than in
an underground sarcophagus.']{.mark}]{.underline}** [At a stroke an end
is put to survival blackmail and life can go on.]{.underline} Everyone
is weary of these apocalyptic visions - the great scenario of the
nuclear threat, the theatrical negotiations, 'Star Wars'. In the end,
they defend themselves with a lack of imagination. Even attempts to
stimulate that imagination in films like The Last Day have not worked.
**[[Nothing has ever been able to make this nuclear]{.mark} scene - or
[obscenity - credible. With delicate matters like this]{.mark} (as with
cancer), [imagining death has the effect of bringing the fatal event
closer.]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[The masses' silent indifference to
nuclear pathos]{.mark} (whether it comes from the nuclear powers or from
antinuclear campaigners) [is therefore a great sign of hope and a
political fact of the utmost importance.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

#### Nuclear war doesn't exist, no actor with nuclear weapons will ever use them, but their threat locks in worldwide securitization of the real or the event. Every action and inaction has to be calculated as to not start war, which locks sterilizes politics, unable to make any real change, deterred by the nuclear.

**Baudrillard 81**(Jean Baudrillard -- French Postmodern Philosopher,
"Simulacra and Simulation"
https://www.e-reading.club/bookreader.php/144970/Simulacra_and_Simulation.pdf)

[The apotheosis of simulation: the nuclear]{.underline}. However, the
balance of terror is never anything but the spectacular slope of a
system of deterrence that has insinuated itself from the inside into all
the cracks of daily life. [[Nuclear suspension only serves to seal the
trivialized system of deterrence]{.mark} that is [at the heart
of]{.mark} the [media, of]{.mark} the [violence without
consequences]{.mark} that reigns [throughout the world]{.mark}, of the
aleatory apparatus of all the choices that are made for us]{.underline}.
The most insignificant of our behaviors is regulated by neutralized,
indifferent, equivalent signs, by zero-sum signs like those that
regulate the \"strategy of games\" (but the true equation is elsewhere,
and the unknown is precisely that variable of simulation which makes of
the atomic arsenal itself a hyperreal form, a simulacrum that dominates
everything and reduces all \"ground-level\" events to being nothing but
ephemeral scenarios, transforming the life left us into survival, into a
stake without stakes - not even into a life insurance policy: into a
policy that already has no value). [It is not the direct threat of
atomic destruction that paralyzes our lives, it is deterrence that gives
them leukemia**. And [this deterrence comes from that fact that]{.mark}
even [the real atomic clash is precluded - precluded like the
eventuality of the real]{.mark} in a system of signs.**]{.underline}
**[[The whole world pretends to believe in the reality of this
threat]{.underline}]{.mark}** (this is understandable on the part of the
military, the gravity of their exercise and the discourse of their
\"strategy\" are at stake), **[but [it is precisely at this level that
there are no]{.mark} strategic [stakes.]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[The
whole originality of the situation lies in the improbability of
destruction. Deterrence precludes war]{.underline}**]{.mark} - the
archaic violence of expanding systems. [Deterrence itself is the
neutral, implosive violence of metastable systems or systems in
involution.]{.underline} **[[There is no longer a subject of deterrence,
nor an adversary nor a strategy - it is a planetary structure of]{.mark}
the [annihilation]{.mark} of stakes. Atomic war, like the Trojan War,
will not take place. [The risk of nuclear annihilation only serves as a
pretext, through the sophistication of weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}** (a
sophistication that surpasses any possible objective to such an extent
that it is itself a symptom of nullity), **[[for installing a universal
security system]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [a universal lockup and control
system whose deterrent effect is not at all aimed at an atomic
clash]{.underline} (which was never in question, except without a doubt
in the very initial stages of the cold war, when one still confused the
nuclear apparatus with conventional war[) but, rather, at the much
greater probability of any real event, of anything that would be an
event in the general system and upset its balance.]{.underline} The
balance of terror is the terror of balance. [Deterrence is not a
strategy, it circulates and is exchanged between nuclear protagonists
exactly as is international capital in the orbital zone of monetary
speculation whose fluctuations suffice to control all global
exchanges.]{.underline} Thus [the money of destruction]{.underline}
(without any reference to real destruction, any more than floating
capital has a real referent of production) that circulates in nuclear
orbit [suffices to control all the violence and potential conflicts
around the world.]{.underline} What is hatched in the shadow of this
mechanism with the pretext of a maximal, \"objective,\" threat, and
thanks to Damocles\' nuclear sword, is **[the perfection of the best
system of control that has ever existed]{.underline}**. And the
progressive satellization of the whole planet through this hypermodel of
security. **[The same goes for peaceful nuclear power stations.
[Pacification does not distinguish between the civil and the military:
everywhere where irreversible apparatuses of control are elaborated,
everywhere where the notion of security becomes omnipotent, everywhere
where the norm replaces the old arsenal of laws and
violence]{.mark}]{.underline}** (including war), [[it is the system of
deterrence that grows, and around it grows the historical, social, and
political desert.]{.underline} **[A gigantic involution that makes every
conflict, every finality, every confrontation contract in proportion to
this blackmail that interrupts, neutralizes, freezes them all. No longer
can any revolt, any story be deployed according to its own logic because
it risks annihilation. No strategy is possible any longer, and
escalation is only a puerile game given over to the military. The
political stake is dead, only simulacra of conflicts and carefully
circumscribed stakes remain]{.underline}**]{.mark}

**[[The \"space race\" played exactly the same role as nuclear
escalation. This is why the space program was]{.mark} so easily [able to
replace it]{.mark} in the 1960s (Kennedy/Khrushchev), or [to develop
concurrently as a form of \"peaceful coexistence.\"]{.mark} Because
what, ultimately, is [the function of the space program]{.mark}, of the
conquest of the moon, of the launching of satellites if not [the
institution of a model of universal gravitation]{.mark}, of
satellization of which the lunar module is the perfect
embryo?]{.underline}** [**[Programmed microcosm, where nothing can be
left to chance]{.underline}**. **[Trajectory, energy, calculation,
physiology, psychology, environment-nothing can be left to
contingencies, this is the total universe of the norm-the Law no longer
exists, it is the operational immanence of every detail that is law. A
universe purged of all threat of meaning, in a state of asepsis and
weightlessness-it is this very perfection that is
fascinating.]{.underline}**]{.mark} [The exaltation of the crowds was
not a response to the event of land­ ing on the moon or of sending a man
into space (this would be, rather, the fulfillment of an earlier dream)
, rather, we are dumb­ founded by the perfection of the programming and
the technical manipulation, by the immanent wonder of the programmed un­
folding of events. Fascination with the maximal norm and the mastery of
probability: Vertigo of the model, which unites with the model of death,
but without fear or drive. Because if the law, with its aura of
transgression, if order, with its aura of violence, still taps a
perverse imaginary, the norm fixes, fascinates, stu­ pefies, and makes
every imaginary involute. One no longer fan­ tasizes about the minutiae
of a program. just watching it pro­ duces vertigo. The vertigo of a world
without flaws. **[Now, it is the same model of programmatic
infallibility, of maximum security and deterrence that today controls
the spread of the social. There lies the true nuclear fallout: the
meticulous operation of technology serves as a model for the meticulous
operation of the social]{.mark}.**]{.underline} [Here as well, nothing
will be left to chance, more­ over this is the essence of socialization,
which began centuries ago, but which has now entered its accelerated
phase, toward a limit that one believed would be explosive (revolution),
but which for the moment is tran,slated by an inverse, implosive, irre­
versible process: the generalized deterrence of chance, of acci­ dent, of
transversality, of finality, of contradiction, rupture, or complexity in
a sociality illuminated by the norm, doomed to the descriptive
transparency of mechanisms of information.]{.underline} **[In fact, [the
spatial and nuclear models do not have their own ends]{.mark}: nei­ ther
the discovery of the moon, nor military and strategic superi­ ority[.
Their truth is to be the models of simulation, the model vectors of a
system of planetary control]{.mark} (where even the super­ powers of this
scenario are not free-the whole world is satellized).]{.underline}**9
[Resist the evidence: in satellization, he who is satellized is not who
one might think. Through the orbital inscription of a spatial object, it
is the planet earth that becomes a satellite, it is the ter­ restrial
principle of reality that becomes eccentric, hyperreal, and
insignificant. [Through the orbital instantiation of a system of control
like peaceful coexistence, all the terrestrial microsystems are
satellized and lose their autonomy]{.mark}. All energy, all events are
absorbed by this eccentric gravitation, everything condenses and
implodes toward the only micromodel of control (the orbital sat­ ellite),
as conversely, in the other, biological, dimension, every­ thing
converges and implodes on the molecular micromodel of the genetic code.
Between the two, in this forking of the nuclear and the genetic, in the
simultaneous assumption of the two fun­ damental codes of deterrence,
every principle of meaning is ab­ sorbed, every deployment of the real is
impossible. The simultaneity of two events in the month of July 1975
illustrated this in a striking manner: the linkup in space of the two
American and Soviet supersatellites, apotheosis of peaceful
coexistence-the suppression by the Chinese of ideogrammatic writing and
conversion to the Roman alphabet.]{.underline} [The latter signifies the
\"orbital\'\' instantiation of an abstract and modelized system of
signs, into whose orbit all the once unique forms of style and writing
will be reabsorbed. The satellization of language: the means for the
Chinese to enter the system of peaceful coexistence, which is inscribed
in their heavens at precisely the same time by the linkup of the two
satellites. Orbital flight of the Big Two, neutralization and
homogenization of everyone else on earth.]{.underline} Yet, despite this
deterrence by the orbital power-the nuclear or molecular code-events
continue at ground level, misfortunes are even more numerous, given the
global process of the contiguity and simultaneity of data. But, subtly,
they no longer have any meaning, they are no longer anything but the
duplex effect of simulation at the summit. The best example can only be
that of the war in Vietnam, because it took place at the intersection of
a maximum historical and \"revolutionary\" stake, and of the
installation of this deterrent authority. What meaning did this war
have, and wasn\'t its unfolding a means of sealing the end of history in
the decisive and culminating historic event of our era? Why did this
war, so hard, so long, so ferocious, vanish from one day to the next as
if by magic? Why did this American defeat (the largest reversal in the
his­ tory of the USA) have no internal repercussions in America? If it
had really signified the failure of the planetary strategy of the United
States, it would necessarily have completely disrupted its internal
balance and the American political system. Nothing of the sort occurred.
Something else, then, took place. This war, at bottom, was nothing but a
crucial episode of peaceful coexistence. It marked the arrival of China
to peaceful coexistence. The nonintervention of China obtained and
secured after many years, China\'s apprenticeship to a global modus
vivendi, the shift from a global strategy of revolution to one of shared
forces and empires, the transition from a radical alternative to
political alternation in a system now essentially regulated (the
normalization of Peking-Washington relations): this was what was at
stake in the war in Vietnam, and in this sense, the USA pulled out of
Vietnam but won the war. And the war ended \"spontaneously\" when this
objective was achieved. That is why it was deescalated, demobilized so
easily. This same reduction of forces can be seen on the field. The war
lasted as long as elements irreducible to a healthy politics and
discipline of power, even a Communist one, remained unliquidated. When
at last the war had passed into the hands of regular troops in the North
and escaped that of the resistance, the war could stop : it had attained
its objective. The stake is thus that of a political relay. As soon as
the Vietnamese had proved that they were no longer the carriers of an
unpredictable subversion, one could let them take over. That theirs is a
Communist order is not serious in the end: it had proved itself, it
could be trusted. It is even more effective than capitalism in the
liquidation of \"savage\" and archaic precapitalist structures. Same
scenario in the Algerian war. The other aspect of this war and of all
wars today: behind the armed violence, the murderous antagonism of the
adversaries­ which seems a matter of life and death, which is played out
as such (or else one could never send people to get themselves killed in
this kind of thing) , behind this simulacrum of fighting to the death
and of ruthless global stakes, the two adversaries are fundamentally in
solidarity against something else, unnamed, never spoken, but whose
objective outcome in war, with the equal complicity of the two
adversaries, is total liquidation. Tribal, communitarian, precapitalist
structures, every form of ex­ change, of language, of symbolic
organization, that is what must be abolished, that is the object of
murder in war-and war itself, in its immense, spectacular death
apparatus, is nothing but the medium of this process of the terrorist
rationalization of the social-the murder on which sociality will be
founded, whatever its allegiance, Communist or capitalist. Total
complicity, or division of labor between two adversaries (who may even
consent to enormous sacrifices for it) for the very end of reshaping and
domesticating social relations. \'The North Vietnamese were advised to
countenance a scenario for liquidating the American presence in the
course of which, of course, one must save face.\" This scenario: the
extremely harsh bombardments of Hanoi. Their untenable character must
not conceal the fact that they were nothing but a simulacrum to enable
the Vietnamese to seem to countenance a compromise and for Nixon to make
the Ameri­ cans swallow the withdrawal of their troops. The game was al­
ready won, nothing was objectively at stake but the verisimilitude of
the final montage. The moralists of war, the holders of high wartime
values should not be too discouraged: the war is no less atrocious for
being only a simulacrum-the flesh suffers just the same, and the dead
and former combatants are worth the same as in other wars. This
objective is always fulfilled, just like that of the charting of
territories and of disciplinary sociality. What no longer exists is the
adversity of t4e adversaries, the reality of antagonistic causes, the
ideological seriousness of war. And also the reality of victory or
defeat, war being a process that triumphs well beyond these appearances.
**[In any case, [the pacification]{.mark} (or the deterrence) [that
dominates us today is beyond war and peace, it is that at every moment
war and peace are equivalent. \"War is peace,\"]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[said Orwell. There also, the two differential poles implode into each
other, or recycle one another-a simultaneity of contradictions that is
at once the par­ ody and the end of every dialectic. Thus one can
completely miss the truth of a war: namely, that it was finished well
before it started, that there was an end to war at the heart of the war
itself, and that perhaps it never started. Many other events (the oil
cri­ sis, etc.) never started, never existed, except as artificial
occurrences-abstract, ersatz, and as artifacts of history, catastrophes
and crises destined to maintain a historical investment under
hypnosis.]{.underline} [The media and the official news service are only
there to maintain the illusion of an actuality, of the reality of the
stakes, of the objectivity of facts]{.underline}. All the events are to
be read backward, or one becomes aware (as with the Communists \"in
power\" in Italy, the retro, posthumous rediscovery of the gulags and
Soviet dissi­ dents like the almost contemporary discovery, by a moribund
ethnology, of the lost \"difference\" of Savages) that all these things
arrived too late, with a history of delay, a spiral of delay, that they
long ago exhausted their meaning and only live from an artificial
effervescence of signs, that all these events succeed each other without
logic, in the most contradictory, complete equivalence, in a profound
indifference to their consequences (but this is be­ cause there are none:
they exhaust themselves in their spectacular promotion)-all \"newsreel\"
footage thus gives the sinister impression of kitsch, of retro and porno
at the same time­ doubtless everyone knows this, and no one really
accepts it. The reality of simulation is unbearable-crueler than
Artaud\'s Theater of Cruelty, which was still an attempt to create a
dramaturgy of life, the last gasp of an ideality of the body, of blood ,
of violence in a system that was already taking it away, toward a
reabsorption of all the stakes without a trace of blood. For us the
trick has been played. All dramaturgy, and even all real writing of
cruelty has disappeared. **[[Simulation is the master]{.mark}, and we
only have a right to the retro, to the phantom, parodic rehabilitation
of all lost referentials. [Everything still unfolds around us, in the
cold light of deterrence]{.mark}]{.underline}** (including Artaud, who
has the right like everything else to his revival, to a second existence
as the referential of cru­ elty). [[This is why nuclear proliferation
does not increase the risk of]{.mark} either [an atomic clash]{.mark} or
an accident]{.underline}-save in the interval when the \"young\" powers
could be tempted to make a nondeterrent[, \"real\" use of it (as the
Americans did in Hiroshima-but precisely only they had a right to this
\"use value\" of the bomb, [all of those who have acquired it since will
be deterred from using it by the very fact of possessing it]{.mark})
.]{.underline} [Entry into the atomic club, so prettily named, very
quickly effaces (as unionization does in the working world) any
inclination toward violent intervention. Responsibility, control,
censure, self-deterrence always grow more rapidly than the forces or the
weapons at our disposal: this is the secret of the social
order.]{.underline} Thus the very possibility of ~~paralyzing~~
\[freezing\] a whole country by flicking a switch makes it so that the
electrical engi­ neers will never use this weapon: [the whole myth of the
total and revolutionary strike crumbles at the very moment when the
means are available-but alas precisely because those means are
available. Therein lies the whole process of deterrence.]{.underline}
[It is thus perfectly probable that one day we will see nuclear powers
export atomic reactors, weapons, and bombs to every lat­ itude. Control
by threat will be replaced by the more effective strategy of
pacification through the bomb and through the pos­ session of the
bomb.]{.underline} The \"little\" powers, believing that they are buying
their independent striking force, will buy the virus of deterrence, of
their own deterrence. [The same goes for the atomic reactors that we
have already sent them: so many neutron bombs knocking out all
historical virulence, all risk of explosion. In this sense, the nuclear
everywhere inaugurates an accelerated process of implosion, it freezes
everything around it, it absorbs all living energy.]{.underline} The
nuclear is at once the culminating point of available energy and the
maximization of energy control systems. Lockdown and control increase in
direct proportion to (and undoubtedly even faster than) liberating
potentialities. This was already the aporia of the modern revolution. It
is still the absolute paradox of the nuclear. Energies freeze in their
own fire, they deter them­ selves. One can no longer imagine what
project, what power, what strategy, what subject could exist behind this
enclosure, this vast saturation of a system by its own forces, now
neutralized, unusable, unintelligible, nonexplosive-except for the
possibility of an explosion toward the center, of an implosion where all
these energies would be abolished in a catastrophic process (in the
literal sense, that is to say in the sense of a reversion of the whole
cycle toward a minimal point, of a reversion of energies toward a
minimal threshold) .

#### Nuclear war is impossible - the symbolic value of the bomb precedes its utility value 

**Robinson 12** (Andy McLaverty-Robinson, political theorist and
activist based in the UK, A to Z articles; "Jean Baudrillard: aleatory
power and deterrence" Ceasefire ,  June 8, 2012,

Jean Bau­drillard Was Here' inscribed on the front of a mil­i­tary bunker
in Bandier, Kuwait (Artist: Alia Farid) Reality is destroyed, or
subordinated to the code, in several ways. It can be generated from
blueprints provided by [the
code](https://ceasefiremagazine.co.uk/in-theory-baudrillard-5/) (as
discussed in earlier sections). [It can be 'deterred', such that real
events are not able to happen. Or it can be recuperated through aleatory
mechanisms of power]{.underline}. Let us start with the third
possibility. The system is aleatory. This means that [it operates
through the management of chance. It is determined in its broad
outlines, but relies on chance for its details]{.underline}. It rests on
probabilities. Because the system determines outcomes 'genetically' --
generating the different options through the code -- only certain things
are possible. The variation by chance and probability allows the system
to control phenomena at an aggregate level. [[An aleatory system]{.mark}
also brings in and incorporates resistances as they occur. It assigns
them a place in the code, as niche markets, questionnaire options,
political parties, categories of deviance. It [is a machine of
total]{.mark} [recuperation which doesn't wait for movements to emerge
before it assigns them a category -- it]{.mark} catches them in their
early stages and [pre-empts them]{.mark}]{.underline}. For instance, a
new social critique might rapidly give rise to a new party or NGO which
is quickly recuperated. Or it might be articulated by corporations
themselves, as a new niche market. Although this process is often
effective, it also contains problems for the system, because ultimately,
it means that [the system is governed by chance]{.underline}. We are
plunged into an [abnormal
uncertainty](https://ceasefiremagazine.co.uk/in-theory-precarity/)[. In
response, [the system creates an excess of]{.mark} [causality and
finality]{.mark}.]{.underline} But this compounds the problem.
Determined responses become hyper telic -- [they exceed their end. [They
become ends in themselves, pass the limits of their functions]{.mark} or
use-values]{.underline}, and colonize the entire system. This process is
also referred to as excrescence. It is similar to the proliferation of
cancer cells in the body. For Baudrillard, this arrangement depends on a
particular religious ontology. An accidental world implies an infinite
will and energy, to keep all determinate connections from forming.
According to Baudrillard, reason seeks to break the necessary
connections among things which arise within cycles of symbolic exchange
and conceptions of fate. Chance -- the possibility of indeterminate,
mutually indifferent elements relating 'freely' -- is an effect of this
decomposition of connections. It is an idea invented in modernity, along
with the idea of a formless, unbonded world. It can only exist in a
world without symbolic exchange. And [[it depends on the]{.mark}
continued [suppression of symbolic exchange]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
idea of chance or the aleatory can be related to the elimination of
symbolic exchange in various ways. [Chance is actually impossible on a
certain level. It is the perception we are left with after the
destruction of causality]{.underline}. It is a world in which one
wanders like a dead soul, with little chance of intense connections.
Chance, and also statistical causality, remove both responsibility and
seduction (or destiny). The dual rule of chance and necessity expresses
a human desire for control over the metamorphosis of things. This
control destroys the initiatory or ceremonial field. It thus
paradoxically destroys any sense of mastery over our destiny[.
[The]{.mark} order of production exists to make the order of
metamorphosis impossible -- to control flow and becoming. [Simulation
is]{.mark} also [associated with]{.mark} a process Baudrillard terms
deterrence. This term is a play on [nuclear deterrence between the
superpowers]{.mark}]{.underline} (before 1991), which Baudrillard saw as
a telling case of [[deterrence]{.mark} in general, a simulated conflict
which [exists to preclude a real clash]{.mark}, a form of manipulation
rather than destruction]{.underline}. Deterrence is not so much a power
relation as a mindset. It holds people in check by making them feel
powerless, disappointed, neutralised -- deterred. [When it is strong
enough, [it no longer needs violent repression or war -- it precludes
conflict in advance.]{.mark} In nuclear deterrence for instance, life is
reduced to survival and conflicts become pointless, as they can't reach
the ultimate stakes]{.underline}. Simulation feigns reality and thereby
deters or prevents reality. But this feigned reality is not entirely
unreal, because it produces effects of reality -- it is like a faked
illness which produces real symptoms. Think for instance of punishments
applied in response to acts: they're neither an objectively real
consequence, since they're invented, nor an imagined consequence, since
they actually happen. They're a simulated consequence, an artificially
created hyper-reality. According to Baudrillard, there is no true
reality against which simulation can be compared. It is therefore more
subversive of reality than a simple appearance or falsehood. It controls
people in a different way -- through persuasion or modelling. Instead of
demanding that people submit to a prior model or norm, it interpellated
people as already being the model or the majority. It thereby destroys
the distance between the self and the norm, making transgression more
difficult. It creates a doubled self from which it is hard to extract
oneself. The question "from where do you speak, how do you know?" is
silenced by the response, "but it is from your position that I speak".
Everything appears to come from and return to the people. The doubled
self is portrayed and displayed in forms such as CCTV images, without a
gap between representation and what is represented. This same doubling
happens across different spheres -- the model is truer than the true,
fashion is more beautiful than the beautiful, hyperreality is more real
than the real, and so on. The effect of excess comes from the lack of
depth (of the imaginary, but also perhaps of relations and of context).
Doubles are inherently fascinating. They're very different from the
seduction of effective images and illusions, such as trompe l'oeil (a
type of art which can be mistaken for a real object). The double allows
a kind of manipulation or blackmail in which the system takes hostage a
part of the self -- affect, desire, a secret -- and uses it for control.
Baudrillard thinks we are stalked by our doubles, like in the film [The
Student of Prague](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLDfWjDxpn4). Yet
doubles are also insufficient. People don't like being 'verified' and
predicted in advance. People prefer ideas of destiny to random
probability. Deterrence is a barrier between ourselves and our drive for
the symbolic. Deterrence also has an effect of deterring thought, of
'mental deterrence'. It discourages people from thinking critically,
hence feeding unreality. Disempowerment feeds into this deterrence of
thought, as do the media, and the promotion of superficial sociality. At
the same time, the system also creates a kind of generalised social
lockdown or universal security system. This 'lockup and control system'
is designed to prevent any real event from happening. **[[This
system]{.mark}, based on norms, [replaces older systems of]{.mark}
violence, [war]{.mark} and law, [creating a social desert around
itself]{.mark}. It tries to pre-plan everything, [to]{.mark} leave
nothing to contingencies or chance. It tries to [make everything
manageable through]{.mark} statistics and [predetermined
responses.]{.mark} The system tries [to prevent accidental death through
systematic, organised death.]{.mark}]{.underline}** For Baudrillard,
this is the culmination of years of civilizing process and
socialization. It is the culmination of the evolution of the dominant
system. The failure of progressive teleologies has occurred because
powers to lock-down and control have increased faster than powers to
emancipate. [[The result is]{.mark} a kind of [generalised nihilism.
Deterrence induces]{.mark} general [mobilisation, pacification and
dissuasion -- a death or incorporation of active energies]{.mark}. The
state dreams of dissuading and annihilating all terrorism pre-emptively,
through a generalized terror on every level.]{.underline} This is the
price of the security of which people now dream, as Baudrillard already
observed in 1983 -- eighteen years before the state's dream was
realized. [Overt and selective repression transmutes over time into
generalized preventive repression. For instance, the police according to
Baudrillard do not reduce violence -- they simply take it over from
crime and and become even more dangerous.]{.underline} [[The code
deters]{.mark} every [real process by means of its operational
double]{.mark}. For instance, [it prevents real revolutions by means of
simulated revolutions,]{.mark} real wars [by means of]{.mark}
**[simulated wars]{.mark}**, and so on.]{.underline} This leaves no
space for the real to unfold of its own accord or for events to happen.
Baudrillard thinks prisons and death are being replaced by a more subtle
regime of control based on therapy, reform and normalization. The right
and left are now represented mainly by the split between direct
repression and indirect pacification. Baudrillard sees these options
corresponding to the early, violent phase of capitalism, with its
emphasis on conscious psychology and responsibility, and its more
advanced, 'neo-capitalist' form, which draws on psychoanalysis and
offers tolerance and reform. A therapeutic model of society, promoted by
advertisers, politicians, and modern experts, actually covers up real
conflicts and contradictions. It seeks to solve social problems by
re-injecting simulations such as controlled smiles and regulated
communication. He also refers to a regime of social control through
security and safety, blackmailing people into conformity with the threat
of their own death. He sees this as surrounding people with a
sarcophagus to prevent them from dying -- a kind of living death[.
Deterrence functions by an anxiety to act because action brings about
massive destruction. [Nuclear states can't go to war because of mutually
assured destruction]{.mark}. Workers won't strike because the entire
economy would be shut down. Small powers which get nuclear weapons
actually buy into their own deterrence.]{.underline} Memory of the
Holocaust is neutralised by its constant repetition on television. While
this shuts down resistance, it also makes the system's power unusable.
[[Power becomes]{.mark} frozen and [self-deterred]{.mark}. It creates a
'protective zone' of 'maximum security' which radiates through the
territory held by the system]{.underline}. It is a kind of 'glacis', a
zone where any assailant is constantly under fire from the system's
defenders. [In a simulated world, events are prevented because no social
logic or story can be deployed according to its own logic]{.underline}.
A social force risks annihilation if it tries this. This leads to an
evacuation of any historical stake from society. We are now living
through the death pangs of strong referentials, including of the sense
of being in the march of history or in hope/at risk of a pending
revolution. [It might actually be better to think of it as
incapacitation rather than deterrence. People become unable or afraid to
act because the capacity to fight and win has been taken away. This
means that e[verything is neutralised, and reinscribed in the
system.]{.mark} This 'absolute model of security' is according to
Baudrillard elaborated from nuclear war. **[The]{.mark} [nuclear battle
station is the point from which the model of deterrence radiates out
through social life.]{.mark}**]{.underline} Deterrence is directed
against a range of phenomena such as complexity, finality,
contradiction, accident, rupture, chance, and transversality. Yet
paradoxically, events continue to happen 'at ground level', below the
level of data-control. Misfortunes and personal crises multiply. The
social becomes organised like a disaster-movie script, with constant
struggles to survive, states of exception, discourses of risk-avoidance
and risk-management -- a situation of [everyday
precarity](https://ceasefiremagazine.co.uk/in-theory-precarity/). The
function of deterrence is not to prevent this permanent crisis. It is
rather to prevent it from having system-level effects. Phenomena such as
the Gulf War, Watergate, and other political/media events are treated by
Baudrillard as instances of deterrence. They are based on a simulation
of a situation where the old stakes still matter, keeping old
antagonisms and lost phenomena artificially alive as simulacra. They
thus exude 'operational negativity' -- preventing the emergence of real
antagonisms. Non-war in the Gulf The theory of deterrence is exemplified
in Baudrillard's analysis of what happened in 1991, when according to
him, the Gulf War 'did not take place'. What took place, instead, was a
'non-war'. This is a type of conflict specific to the third order of
simulation. A non-war is a simulated war. It reproduces exactly the
elements of a real war, down to its destruction, death, propaganda, and
so on. But it is not a situation which arises between adversaries, which
is a real, unpredictable event. A true war is a strategic conflict over
an absent centre of power which no-one can occupy. Both sides believe in
a cause; the outcome is unpredictable. This is why a non-war is not a
true war. Real power, according to Baudrillard, is a strategy, a
relation of force, and a stake. It is subject to death and the symbolic.
On the other hand, power exercised to conceal its own absence is no
longer subject to death and the symbolic. It can persist indefinitely,
as an object of consumer demand. For Baudrillard, [[war is]{.mark}
pointless and [impossible]{.mark} to wage [in the nuclear era.]{.mark}
There is no proportion between means (total annihilation) and ends
(strategic objectives). Hence, the 'scene' of war -- [the scenario of
total conflict to the death]{.mark}, or of adversity over stakes between
combatants -- [will never again take place. War becomes]{.mark}
'[impossible to exchange'; it escapes symbolic exchange.]{.mark} The
distillation of [war in everyday fear]{.mark} [prevents]{.mark} the
final [apocalyptic clash]{.mark}. Arguably, non-war is to war as
hyperreality is to reality. A non-war is a simulation in the sense of
derivation from a prior model. [Western powers fight non-wars based on
models, and go to war based on models]{.mark}. The non-war, at least on
the western side, is an operational unfolding of models and signs
already planned in advance. [The symbolic dimension, the exchange with
the enemy, the reversibility of actions, are
abse]{.mark}n]{.underline}t. This is why, for Baudrillard, it is not a
war, even though all the other characteristics of war are very much
present. He emphasizes repeatedly that non-war is still as deadly as war
ever was. What it has lost is 'the adversity of the adversaries', the
'ideological seriousness' of a war between two counterposed
possibilities, [the reality of victory or defeat as systemic
changes]{.underline}. For Baudrillard, [[western non-wars are now
simulations in that there isn't really a fight to the death between two
adversaries]{.mark}. Rather, [the purpose]{.mark} of western power, and
usually of both adversaries, [is to prevent the liquidation of the
system's deterrence]{.mark}.]{.underline} This requires the destruction
of symbolic exchange, and hence of 'pre-capitalist' societies and
groups. Non-war is missing the symbolic dimension a true war might have
-- the possibility of reversibility, or conflictual dialogue with an
enemy so to speak. Contact between America and Iraq did not happen
during the Gulf War. America can only imagine an adversary in their own
image. They are invulnerable to symbolic violence, due to their
pragmatism and masochism. America has been caught in a spiral of
unconditional repression by the aspiration to be a global police force.
They try to humiliate by defeating the enemy impersonally -- "nothing
personal" -- and avoid seeing or meeting the adversary. They seek to
show the infallibility of their machine, displaying signs of
relentlessness. They seek to avoid any reaction or living impulse. In
electronic war, the enemy no longer exists -- there is only refractory
data to be neutralized and brought into the consensus.

#### The world has been taken hostage by the logics of deterrence - Their conceptualization of nuclear war erases the principles of reality that allow entities to unfold according to their own logic

**Oberg 14** (Dan Öberg , Associate Professor of War Studies at the
Swedish Defence University, Internatinoal Journal of Baudrillard
Studies; "Baudrillard and War" Volume 11, Number 2, May, 2014,
https://baudrillardstudies.ubishops.ca/baudrillard-and-war/ ) EM\
As many have noted Baudrillard is first and foremost a 'critic'
(Ranciere 2006, Grace 2000: 1). To Baudrillard it is not so much [a
theory of war that is lacking but [a proper critique of war's
ontology]{.mark}. So what does his critique imply? Arguably he was well
ahead of his time [with regards to understanding]{.mark} how war related
to advertisement, mass media, and the television]{.underline}. More than
three decades before Ignatieff wrote about 'virtual wars', Baudrillard
had already noticed how the virtual leaked into the real with regards to
the Vietnam War. For example, in 1967 he claimed that the TV images of
the war takes us away from human reality (and classical conceptions of
war) towards a world of advertising (2001: 42). This was a time when,
for Baudrillard, as for Marxism in general, [[war was]{.mark} mostly
seen as [an integrated part of the capitalist
system]{.mark}]{.underline} (1975: 145 and 1998b: 55, 57, 121). In the
beginning of the 1970's, particularly after the book The Mirror of
Production and his definitive break with Marxism, Baudrillard's view on
war changed. So what does this change imply? It might be easy to
associate his thinking on war with what took place (or did not take
place) in the Gulf in 1991, but to Baudrillard this was merely a symptom
of other more complex underlying logics. Perhaps we might say that the
most intriguing aspect about the Gulf War was not its build up, conduct,
or media-coverage, but what this illustrated about war as
such.[3](https://baudrillardstudies.ubishops.ca/baudrillard-and-war/#3)
He starts his essay 'The Gulf War will not take place', written before
'the war started' by stating that: '(f)rom the beginning we knew that
this war would never happen' (Baudrillard 1995: 23). It is therefore not
a matter of whether the US starts bombing en masse or not (after a
build-up phase of seven months) but something quite different: the Gulf
War is about the ontological status of war itself (Baudrillard 1995:
32). Therefore, the impact of his thinking on war goes well beyond the
Gulf. To grasp these logics we need to go back to his writings on the
Cold War and particularly the notion of deterrence. Long before the Gulf
War, Baudrillard had already identified deterrence as a key factor to
understanding war. As he argues, ever since the end of World War II --
when politics was still dependent on the distinction between war and
peace -- [[the world had been]{.mark} [taken hostage to the logic of
deterrence]{.mark}. This means that he sees deterrence, not as simply
dictating behavior (through for example coercion or intimidation, as in
Schelling 1966) but [as something which]{.mark} [makes]{.mark} the
underlying [principles of reality disappear]{.mark}.]{.underline} While
traditional theory around military strategy would think of deterrence as
something to manage through bargaining or rational behavior, Baudrillard
sees it [as something [which puts an end to the possibility of military
strategy and has severe]{.mark} [consequences for our understanding
of]{.mark} events, [history, and politics: Deterrence precludes war
--]{.mark} the archaic violence of expanding systems. Deterrence [itself
is the neutral, implosive violence of]{.mark} metastable systems or
[systems in involution.]{.mark} There is no longer a subject of
deterrence, nor an adversary nor a strategy -- [it is a planetary
structure of the annihilation of stakes]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Baudrillard, 1994a: 32-33, my emphasis).../...Everywhere where
irreversible apparatuses of control are elaborated, everywhere where the
notion of security becomes omnipotent, everywhere where the norm
replaces the old arsenal of laws and violence (including war), it is the
system of deterrence that grows, and around it grows the historical,
social, and political desert. [A gigantic involution [that makes
every]{.mark} [conflict]{.mark}, every finality, every confrontation
[contract in proportion to this blackmail that]{.mark} interrupts,
[neutralizes]{.mark}, freezes [them all.]{.mark} No longer can any
revolt, any story be deployed according to its own logic because it
risks annihilation. [No strategy is possible any longer,]{.mark} and
**[escalation is only a puerile game given over to the
military.]{.mark}**]{.underline} The political stake is dead, only
simulacra of conflicts and carefully circumscribed stakes remain (Ibid.:
33-34). The consequences for war's being are therefore severe. These
consequences are perhaps best illustrated 'in reality' through the way
the excess of high-tech weapon systems, so characteristic for the Cold
War, participate in making war lose its character (Baudrillard 1989).
During the Cold War countries like the US and the Soviet Union had
enough nuclear warheads to destroy the human civilization many times
over. With the introduction of intercontinental ballistic missiles
(increasing range and effect) and atomic submarines (giving second
strike capability), [[nuclear warfare reached a 'hyperefficiency' which
also made it useless for waging war. Baudrillard]{.mark} sees this
uselessness as part of a larger social context [which indicates a:
'disgust for a world that is]{.mark} growing, accumulating, sprawling,
[sliding into hypertrophy,]{.mark} a world that cannot manage to give
birth']{.underline} (Baudrillard 1989: 31). The Cold war thereby helps
to produce [[a ']{.mark}stillborn' [world with an excess of]{.mark}
memories, archives, documentation, [sophisticated weapon-systems, plans,
programs, and decisions]{.mark} [that does not lead to either wars or
events]{.mark}]{.underline} (1989: 31). Therefore [[any war that is
being waged as real is]{.mark} [always circumscribed by the
overkill-capacity of nuclear war, in turn becoming less and less
warlike]{.mark} and more and more a simulation of war.]{.underline} As
Baudrillard concludes in Cool Memories V: '(w)ar is impossible, and yet
it takes place. But the fact that it takes place in no way detracts from
its impossibility. The system is absurd and yet it functions. But the
fact that it functions in no way detracts from its absurdity' (2006b:
25). War has become absurd, but no less deadly for that matter. To
Baudrillard the notion of war has therefore entered into a definitive
crisis, best illustrated by how deterrence erases political stakes and
supplant them with virtual stakes precluding events of war. The end of
the Cold War does not put an end to deterrence but rather continues
through new means such as drug wars, debt wars, or soft wars (1996: 87):
The powerful of this world are gathered in Rome to sign a treaty 'that
puts a final end to the Cold War'. In fact they do not know they are
starting a new war, of which they are the first victims: they remained
parked on the tarmac, surrounded by armoured cars, barbed wire and
helicopters -- the whole panoply of this new cold war, the cold war of
armed security, of perpetual deterrence and faceless terrorism (2006b:
45-46). Much of Baudrillard's writings on war after the end of the Cold
war grapple with these 'new characteristics of war' and its relation to
history, politics, events, media, or economy (see for example
Baudrillard 1995: 24-26, 65-68). If seen through the prism of real and
virtual war we can appreciate the difference between Baudrillard's
account and Marxism. As stated in the previous part Marxism tends to
consider war an integrated part of the capitalist system. Baudrillard on
the other hand illustrates [how war is the victim of a separation in
kind as it is turned into an object without use-value but with
simulation-value]{.underline} (1990:56) something which became all the
more obvious during the build up for the war in Iraq 2003 and the WMD
debate which was used as a rationale for invasion. If we accept that
real [[war has disintegrate]{.mark}d and lost its principles [under
the]{.mark} virtual [catastrophe of]{.mark} total [nuclear]{.mark} and
orbital [war]{.mark} (Baudrillard 1993: 29; 2002b: 21-22) -- we are
forced to reconsider what a theory of war implies: [Traditional
theorists of war must be]{.mark}...[at a loss]{.mark} before the
explosion of their object of study. For, paradoxically, it [isn't the
bomb which has exploded, but the war]{.mark}-[object]{.mark}, which has
exploded into two separate parts -- a total, virtual war in orbit and
multiple real wars on the ground]{.underline}. The two have neither the
same dimensions nor the same rules...(2002b: 22-23). Hence, to
Baudrillard, war consists of two inseparable but incompatible forms with
two kinds of logic. Moreover, through this virtual, simulated version of
war, the 'real' war (just like 'real' production or 'real' economy) is
also dislocated (Baudrillard 1993: 31, 1994a). [The referent changes
from being one of battles between armies to one of the simulation of
this battle. [Uncertainty seeps into war]{.mark} ('is this really a
war?') and what [used to be at stake in a war of violence]{.mark} (such
as conquest or domination) [are no]{.mark} [longer the underlying
principles of war's ontology]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} This
uncertainty spawns wars of 'pure speculation' waged as advertisement
campaigns (Baudrillard 1995: 28-29).

#### Deterrence precludes nuclear war however threats of nuclear annihilation serve to reify a universal security apparatus. The balance of terror is nothing more than the terror of balance

**Baudrillard 81** (Jean, Simulacra and Simulation: The Orbital and the
Nuclear, 1981, CP) *EM*

 

The apotheosis of simulation: the nuclear. However, [the balance of
terror is never anything but the spectacular slope of a system of
deterrence that has insinuated itself from the inside into all the
cracks of daily life]{.underline}. [Nuclear
suspension]{.underline} only [serves to seal the trivialized system of
deterrence that is at the heart of the media]{.underline}, [of the
violence without consequences that reigns throughout the
world]{.underline}, of the aleatory apparatus of all the choices that
are made for us. [The most insignificant of our behaviors is regulated
by neutralized, indifferent, equivalent signs]{.underline}, [by zero-sum
signs like those that regulate the \"strategy of
games\"]{.underline} (but the true equation is elsewhere, and the
unknown is precisely that variable of simulation [which makes of the
atomic arsenal itself a hyperreal form]{.underline}, [a simulacrum that
dominates everything and reduces all \"ground-level\" events to being
nothing but ephemeral scenarios]{.underline}, [transforming the life
left us into survival, into a stake without stakes]{.underline} - [not
even into a life insurance policy: into a policy that already has no
value]{.underline}). It is not the direct threat of atomic destruction
that paralyzes our lives, it is deterrence that gives them leukemia.
And [this deterrence comes from that fact that even the real atomic
clash is precluded]{.underline} - precluded like the eventuality of the
real in a system of signs. [The whole world pretends to believe in the
reality of this threat ]{.underline}(this is understandable on the part
of the military, the gravity of their exercise and the discourse of
their \"strategy\" are at stake), [but it is precisely at this level
that there are no strategic stakes]{.underline}. [The whole originality
of the situation lies in the improbability of destruction. Deterrence
precludes war - the archaic violence of expanding
systems]{.underline}. Deterrence itself is the neutral, implosive
violence of metastable systems or systems in involution. There is no
longer a subject of deterrence, nor an adversary nor a strategy - it is
a planetary structure of the annihilation of stakes. Atomic war, like
the Trojan War, will not take place. The risk of nuclear annihilation
only serves as a pretext, through the sophistication of weapons (a
sophistication that surpasses any possible objective to such an extent
that it is itself a symptom of nullity), for installing a universal
security system, a universal lockup and control system whose deterrent
effect is not at all aimed at an atomic clash (which was never in
question, except without a doubt in the very initial stages of the cold
war, when one still confused the nuclear apparatus with conventional
war) but, rather, at the much greater probability of any real event, of
anything that would be an event in the general system and upset its
balance. The balance of terror is the terror of balance. Deterrence is
not a strategy, it circulates and is exchanged between nuclear
protagonists exactly as is international capital in the orbital zone of
monetary speculation whose fluctuations suffice to control all global
exchanges. Thus the money of destruction (without any reference to real
destruction, any more than floating capital has a real referent of
production) that circulates in nuclear orbit suffices to control all the
violence and potential conflicts around the world. What is hatched in
the shadow of this mechanism with the pretext of a maximal,
\"objective,\" threat, and thanks to Damocles\' nuclear sword, is the
perfection of the best system of control that has ever existed. And the
progressive satellization of the whole planet through this hypermodel of
security.

### Politics

#### Politics is dead. Politics has entered the stage of Simulacra since the dawn of Neo-Liberal democracy, the only thing that exists is the hologram of its existence, there's simply nothing inside, contentless. Resistance through confrontation of the system achieves nothing, but rather revives the haunting ghost of the political. We must reimagine power itself, the fact that politics is already dead. 

**Baudrillard 94** (Jean Baudrillard, "Simulacra and Simulation: Hyper
Market and Hyper Commodity, pg24-27)SY

These staged presidential assassinations are revealing because they
signal the status of all negativity in the West: political opposition,
the \"Left,\" critical discourse, etc. - a simulacral contrast through
which power attempts to break the vicious circle of its nonexistence, of
its fundamental irresponsibility, of its \"suspension.\" Power floats
like money, like language, like theory. [Criticism and
[negativity]{.mark} alone still [secrete a phantom of the reality of
power]{.mark}. If they become weak for one reason or another,
**[power]{.mark} has no other recourse but to [artificially revive and
hallucinate them]{.mark}**]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} [I]{.underline}**[t
**is in this way that the [Spanish executions]{.mark} still [serve as a
stimulant to]{.mark} Western liberal democracy, to [a dying system of
democratic values]{.mark}. [Fresh blood]{.mark}, but for how much
longer?** The deterioration of all power is irresistibly pursued: it is
[not]{.mark} so much the \"[revolutionary forces\" that accelerate this
process]{.mark} (often it is quite the opposite[), it is the system
itself that deploys against its own structures]{.mark} this violence
that annuls all substance and all finality. **One [must not
resist]{.mark} this process [by]{.mark} trying to [confront]{.mark} the
system [and destroy]{.mark} it, because this [system]{.mark} that is
[dying]{.mark} from being dispossessed of its death [expects nothing but
that from us: that we give the system back its death]{.mark}, that we
revive it through the negative. End of revolutionary praxis[, end of the
dialectic]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Curiously, Nixon, who was not even
found worthy of dying at the hands of the most insignificant, chance,
unbalanced person (and though it is perhaps true that presidents are
assassinated by unbalanced types, this changes nothing: the leftist
penchant for detecting a rightist conspiracy beneath this brings out a
false problem - the function of bringing death to, or the prophecy,
etc., against power has always been fulfilled, from primitive societies
to the present, by demented people, crazy people, or neurotics, who
nonetheless carry out a social function as fundamental as that of
presidents), was nevertheless ritually put to death by Watergate.
[Watergate is still a mechanism for the ritual murder of
power]{.underline} (the American institution of the presidency is much
more thrilling in this regard than the European: it surrounds itself
with all the violence and vicissitudes of primitive powers, of savage
rituals). [But already impeachment is no longer assassination: it
happens via the Constitution. **[Nixon]{.mark} has nevertheless [arrived
at]{.mark} the goal of which [all power dreams: to be taken seriously
enough]{.mark}, to constitute a mortal enough danger to the group to be
one day relieved of his duties, denounced, and liquidated. [Ford]{.mark}
doesn\'t even have this opportunity anymore: a simulacrum of an already
dead power, he [can only accumulate against himself]{.mark} the signs of
reversion [through murder]{.mark} - in fact, he is immunized by his
impotence, which infuriates him.**]{.underline} In contrast to the
primitive rite, which foresees the official and sacrificial death of the
king (the king or the chief is nothing without the promise of his
sacrifice), the modern political imaginary goes increasingly in the
direction of delaying, of concealing for as long as possible, the death
of the head of state. This obsession has accumulated since the era of
revolutions and of charismatic leaders: Hitler, Franco, Mao, having no
\"legitimate\" heirs, no filiation of power, see themselves forced to
perpetuate themselves indefinitely - popular myth never wishes to
believe them dead. The pharaohs already did this: it was always one and
the same person who incarnated the successive pharaohs. Everything
happens as if Mao or Franco had already died several times and had been
replaced by his double. From a political point of view, that a head of
state remains the same or is someone else doesn\'t strictly change
anything, so long as they resemble each other. For a long time now a
head of state - no matter which one - is nothing but the simulacrum of
himself, and only that gives him the power and the quality to govern. No
one would grant the least consent, the least devotion to a real person.
It is to his double, he being always already dead, to which allegiance
is given. This myth does nothing but translate the persistence, and at
the same time the deception, of the necessity of the king\'s sacrificial
death. [W**e are still in the same boat: [no society knows how to mourn
the real]{.mark}, power, the social itself, which is implicated in the
same loss. And [it is through an artificial revitalization of all this
that we try to escape this fact]{.mark}.**]{.underline} This situation
will no doubt end up giving rise to socialism. Through an unforeseen
turn of events and via an irony that is no longer that of history, it is
from the death of the social that socialism will emerge, as it is from
the death of God that religions emerge. A twisted advent, a perverse
event, an unintelligible reversion to the logic of reason. [**As is the
fact that [power is]{.mark} in essence no longer [present]{.mark} except
[to conceal that there is no]{.mark} more [power]{.mark}.** A simulation
that can last indefinitely, because, as distinct from \"true\" power -
which is, or was, a structure, a strategy, a relation of force, a
stake - it is nothing but the object of a social demand, and thus as the
object of the law of supply and demand, it is no longer subject to
violence and death. **Completely [purged of a political dimension, it,
like any other commodity, is dependent on mass production and
consumption]{.mark}.** Its spark has disappeared, only the fiction of a
political universe remains.]{.underline} The same holds true for work.
The spark of production, the violence of its stakes no longer exist. The
whole world still produces, and increasingly, but subtly work has become
something else: a need (as Marx ideally envisioned it but not in the
same sense), the object of a social \"demand,\" like leisure, to which
it is equivalent in the course of everyday life. [A demand exactly
proportional to the loss of a stake in the work process.\*6 Same change
in fortune as for power: the scenario of work is there to conceal that
the real of work, the real of production, has disappeared. And the real
of the strike as well, which is no longer a work stoppage, but its
alternate pole in the ritual scansion of the social calendar. Everything
occurs as if each person had, after declaring a strike, \"occupied\" his
place and work station and recommenced production, as is the norm in a
\"self-managed\" occupation, exactly in the same terms as before, all
while declaring himself (and in virtually being) permanently on
strike.]{.underline} This is not a dream out of science fiction:
everywhere it is a question of doubling the process of work. And of a
doubling of the process of going on strike - striking incorporated just
as obsolescence is in objects, just as crisis is in production. So,
there is no longer striking, nor work, but both simultaneously, that is
to say something else: a magic of work, a trompel\'oeil, a scenodrama
(so as not to say a melodrama) of production, a collective dramaturgy on
the empty stage of the social. [**It is no longer a question of the
ideology of work** - the traditional ethic that would obscure the
\"real\" process of work and the \"objective\" process of exploitation -
**but of the scenario of work. In the same way, it is [no longer a
question of the ideology]{.mark} of power, [but]{.mark} of [the scenario
of power]{.mark}**(. **[Ideology]{.mark} only corresponds [to a
corruption of reality]{.mark} through signs; [simulation]{.mark}
corresponds to [a short circuit of reality and to its
duplication]{.mark} through signs.**]{.underline} [It is always the goal
of the ideological analysis to restore the objective process, **it is
always a false problem to wish to restore the truth beneath the
simulacrum.**]{.underline} **[This is why in the end power is so much in
tune with ideological discourses and discourses on ideology, that is
they are discourses of truth - always good for countering the mortal
blows of simulation, even and especially if they are
revolutionary.]{.underline}**

#### Politics is, like, definitely dead. Probably. 

**Shapiro, 20** (Alan Shapiro, baudrillard genius, "Is Trump a Fascist
or is He the Parody of Fascism?" 10/31/2020,

Epistemology of True and False [[The]{.mark} kind of media
theory]{.underline} or media analysis which has been prevalent on the
American political left for the past several decades [operates
essentially with an **[epistemology of true and
false]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Noam Chomsky has always been subtle and
nuanced in describing the moral complicity of the intellectual class
(and his own personal struggle to overcome that complicity) with
abhorrent U.S. government policies such as the destruction of Vietnam in
the 1960s or of Iraq in 1991. Yet Chomsky's commentaries on what the
corporate liberal media reports on politics, current events, and world
affairs are [largely about exposing the lies that the news media tells
and recounting the **contextual and factual realities**]{.underline} [on
the ground which they conceal]{.underline}. Chomsky only analyzes the
entity called the news media. He does not analyze the media as a whole
-- for example, entertainment TV shows, advertising, celebrity culture,
or blockbuster movies. He assumes that an understanding of the news
media or of the domain called politics or the public sphere can be
accomplished without connecting the news media to the media in general
in the overall situation of advanced capitalism. In classic works such
as Manufacturing Consent (co-authored with Edward S. Herman and
published in 1992) and Media Control (2002), Chomsky argues that [the
mass communications news media carries out the propaganda function of
lying]{.underline}.1 Powerful business interests which have a profit
motive manipulate the media, which in turn manipulates and controls the
citizenry. [The truth that American foreign policy has the essential
function of **[establishing]{.mark} governments around the world which
are politically controlled by us and are friendly to big companies is
concealed by the dissemination of falsehoods**]{.underline}. [[The role
of the **leftist**]{.mark} **activist** or journalist **[is to tell the
truth]{.mark} about any given political conjuncture.** Chomsky's work is
extremely valuable, yet what is Chomsky's perspective missing? **[In
their war against Trump]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [the [liberal]{.mark}
political [media]{.mark} -- CNN and the New York Times]{.underline}, for
example -- [take the same tack as Noam Chomsky in **[epistemologically
framing]{.mark}** their **[struggle]{.mark}** with the **fake
billionaire** [as]{.mark} a battle **between [true and
false]{.mark}**]{.underline}, between facts and lies.
**[Trump]{.underline}** is constantly **[telling lies]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} the **[Washington Post is unmasking them every
day]{.underline}**, [keeping a list of them, **setting the record
straight**]{.underline}. As of July 2020, Trump had told twenty thousand
lies. It is no surprise that Chomsky and the liberal media share this
same epistemology -- [they both [believe in]{.mark} the philosophy and
the historical project of the [modernist **Enlightenment**]{.mark}:
facts, science, [**truth**, **communication**,
**rationality**]{.mark}]{.underline} [-- these are allegedly the great
achievements of the democratic West]{.underline}. Never mind that it was
**[[this]{.underline}]{.mark}** same liberal **[media]{.underline}**
that **[[helped Trump win]{.underline}]{.mark}** the Republican
nomination for President in the first place against sixteen other
candidates in 2016. Trump merged the sphere of politics with shock jock
Reality TV World Wrestling Federation media entertainment. He provided
those liberal TV stations, newspapers, and websites with a new
sensationalistic headline every day for many months. **[[Since making
money is their highest priority]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- and
astonishment, titillation, and breakdown are the commodities they sell
-- [**[the media loved it and made Trump their absolute focus of
attention.]{.mark} Society of the Spectacle and Hyperreality** An
alternative]{.underline} to the epistemology of true and false as a
media theory -- which is derivative of the assumption that Enlightenment
rationality and the civilized discussion advocated by John Stuart Mill
in On Liberty are going to save us -- [was offered by]{.underline} the
French Situationist [Guy Debord]{.underline} in his 1967 book Society of
the Spectacle.2 Let me state that my position is that we should seek a
balance between the modernist commitment to truth and the post-modernist
placing into question of that assumption. [I do not want to reject
rationality and truth, but I believe that new strategies are urgently
required as well]{.underline}. Guy Debord was a neo-Marxist thinker
attempting to comprehend how control over the lives of workers by
capitalists expanded from the sphere of production to consumerism,
everyday life, and the media culture of images and rhetoric in the
historical progression to advanced capitalism. [With his concept of the
spectacle, Debord understood that the **omnipresence** of **visual
images institutes** a world of **both abstraction and
passivity**]{.underline}, [a **diminishing** of what is "**directly
lived**" and an **increase** in the **autonomy** and **power of the
images themselves**]{.underline}.3 [[Something becomes]{.mark} true --
or **[more true than true]{.mark}**]{.underline} [--]{.mark} [[by virtue
of having been said]{.mark}, or said [charismatically, **in the
media**]{.mark}]{.underline}. **[In the spectacle]{.underline}**, "[the
liar has lied to himself]{.underline}." "[In a world which is
topsy-turvy," writes Debord, "**the true is a moment of the false**."4
**Social life goes beyond** the shift from being to having to
**appearing and the reign of appearances.**]{.underline} The media
theorist and semiotician Jean Baudrillard developed Guy Debord's notion
of the society of the spectacle even further into his theory of
simulation, simulacra, and hyper-reality.5 Baudrillard's most celebrated
book is his 1981 volume Simulacra and Simulation, where he famously
wrote about the map preceding the territory, and about Disneyland
existing to conceal the fact that all of America is Disneyland.6
[Simulacra are copies without originals]{.underline}. Semiotics
(linguistics applied to culture) teaches us about the signifier and the
signified, which together constitute the linguistic-cultural sign. In
post-modernism, the signifiers (**[images and discourses]{.underline}**)
come to **[replace]{.underline}** the signifieds (**[facts and
references]{.underline}**) [of which the visuals and words are supposed
to be the reliable and verifiable representations. **Representation is
surpassed by simulation**. [Words and images]{.mark} stand on their own
and **[have no reference]{.mark}**.7 **[The
spectacle]{.mark}**]{.underline} itself has **[[become
the]{.underline}]{.mark}** main **[[thing that]{.mark} the [contemporary
society and economy produce]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Consumer objects,
architectural ambiences, and media artefacts all primarily have an
abstract semiotic function. In the system of objects (Baudrillard's
first book of 1968 was The System of Objects), the physicality and
definite location of objects gets subordinated to their participation in
the "perfect circulation of messages."8 [The intercommunication and
relationality of sign-objects to each other takes precedence over the
specificity of each. All objects and media content enter into an
equivalence through their common belonging to the universal
self-congratulatory communication system]{.underline}. Each product ad
refers not only to the individual product that it is informing us about
-- it also refers to itself as ad, endorsing the wonder of advertising
per se. Through the spectacular celebration or radical visibility of a
single object or brand, it is the totality of objects and a universe
made complete by brands that is promoted. In speaking of one single
consumer object, advertising virtually glorifies all spectacle objects
and media images. [Consumer society]{.underline} (Baudrillard's second
book of 1970 was The Consumer Society) [does not satisfy needs but is
rather a manipulation of signs]{.underline}.9 [[To become]{.mark} a
**consumer object** or [**media message**, the entity **must**]{.mark}
first **[enter]{.mark}** into **[the universal
sign-system]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Baudrillard's third book of 1972 was
For a Critique of the Political Economy of the Sign.10 Karl Marx's
political-economic theory of the commodity-form of exchange value in
production capitalism gets merged -- and in a critical way -- with a
radicalization of Ferdinand de Saussure's linguistic semiotics in an
original fusion critique of the sign-form in consumer capitalism.11
Baudrillard articulates the homology between Saussure's linguistic sign
and Marx's commodity form. [This unified political economy of the sign
or analysis of the **commodity-slash-sign form equals the
code**]{.underline}. [The real, the lived, [the myth of an **objective
reality**]{.mark}]{.underline} -- [they all [become alibis for]{.mark}
the **[simulation models]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The signifier of the
greatness of America's prosperity is standing in for concrete
singularities of objects. The code of signifiers substitutes for
references in the immense process of simulation. [We live in the formal
democracy of standards of living and signs of affluence -- the republic
of the automobile, the cheeseburger, and the home entertainment
system]{.underline}. **[Affluence is the accumulation of signs of
happiness.]{.underline}** The media in general have cut us off from real
access to historical events. Everything that I know about the Holocaust,
the Second World War, and the Vietnam War comes from Hollywood films
about those events which I have seen. Baudrillard cites many times an
aphorism by Jewish German-language philosopher Elias Canetti from 1945,
speaking about a certain point in history, when exactly this point was
is unknowable, when history itself disappeared. Canetti writes: "As of a
certain point, history was no longer real. Without noticing it, all
mankind suddenly left reality, everything happening since then was not
true; but we didn't notice."12 In his essay on Francis Ford Coppola's
1979 blockbuster Vietnam War movie Apocalypse Now, Baudrillard writes
that Coppola's masterpiece is the continuation of the Vietnam War by
other means. "Nothing else in the world smells like that," says Lt.
Colonel Bill Kilgore (Robert Duvall). "I love the smell of napalm in the
morning... It smells like victory."13 [The high-budget extravaganza was
produced the same way that America fought in Vietnam]{.underline}.
"**[War became film]{.underline}**," writes Baudrillard. "**[Film
becomes war]{.underline}**, [the two are **joined by** their common
**hermorrhage into technology**]{.underline}."14 There is implosion or
mutual contamination between film becoming Virtual Reality and War.
[**Donald Trump the Empty Signifier** [Donald Trump is a product]{.mark}
of this culture of postmodern anything goes images and
rhetoric]{.underline}. The mythology of Trump was born during the New
York City gilded 1980s, the era of Ivan Boesky and Gordon Gecko greed
and Wall Street insider trading. Donald Trump plastered the name Donald
Trump everywhere he could. [He of the golden toilet, he the playboy
ladies' man, the casino owner, the entrepreneur of the opulence of the
billion-dollar Atlantic City Taj Majal gambling and entertainment
paradise-complex]{.underline}. He was a failed businessman and a
gangster, but on Reality TV he played the ultimate glamorous billionaire
whom many Americans admired and dreamed of themselves becoming.
[President Trump lies and his supporters believe it. For them, his
**[charismatic speech]{.mark}** has [**become more powerful**
than]{.mark} the [**democratic and scientific systems** of **true and
false**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} In two of his final texts -- Carnival
and Cannibal and The Agony of Power -- written shortly before his death
in 2007, Jean Baudrillard describes a newer "order of simulacra" which
is the phase of irony, parody and the carnivalesque.15 Baudrillard
upgrades his concepts of simulacra, simulation, and hyper-reality into a
cogent diagnosis of the self-parodistic stage of Western society.
[**[Simulation]{.mark}** or **hyper-reality** [is **no longer**]{.mark}
the [**artificial staging** of]{.mark} a **so-called [reality]{.mark}**
[by]{.mark} the [**models** and **codes** which **precede
it**]{.mark}.]{.underline} **[[Simulation is now a
farce]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [an immense irony, a masquerade, a
funhouse-mirror [distortion of]{.mark} the [previous values and
ideals]{.mark} of modernism: freedom, culture, truth,
humanitarianism]{.underline}. "Every signification is eliminated in its
own sign," writes Baudrillard in The Agony of Power, "and the profusion
of signs parodies a by now unobtainable reality... [Power is only the
parody of the signs of power -- the cannibalization of reality by
signs."]{.underline}16 [The values of the West and of America
**degenerate into a caricature of themselves** and **devour
themselves**. **This is Donald Trump**.]{.underline} We have experienced
these past four years -- in the masterful showmanship of Donald Trump
and his fanatic deplorable followers, in the full-scale replacement of
politics by Reality TV, in the tele-morphosis of the merger between
Reality TV and everyday life -- the disappearance of political substance
into the fascination with the banality of insults (see Hannah Arendt's
banality of evil) that is now the hallmark of the media-celebrity-gossip
culture of obscenity which dominates American life and the online
monopoly social media platforms.17 [[Donald Trump is a **successful
empty signifier**]{.underline}]{.mark}. "[The bigger he got as a name,
the smaller he got as a person,"]{.underline} said recently the former
Trump Organization executive Barbara A. Res.18 [Trump is the ultimate
simulacrum, the living demonstration of the **rule of the signifiers
over the signifieds**]{.underline}. Fake is not a betrayal of
authenticity. [Trump is the most talented fake in the
world]{.underline}. **[[Lies are exciting]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [They
[set in motion]{.mark} their own [forceful
narrative]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [When Trump says something, **it
becomes true**]{.underline}]{.mark} [because Trump says it, and there is
little that the New York Times or the Washington Post can do about
it]{.underline}. The institutional bases for consensus and legitimation
of the truth have disappeared beneath the mountains of information and
the virtualization of discourse. **[[The media culture]{.mark} in
general [paved the way for Trump]{.mark}]{.underline}**. All of America
is responsible for the disastrous situation in which we now find
ourselves. From Simulation to the Grotesque and the Self-Parody A not so
well-known aspect of Baudrillard's theory of simulation and
hyper-reality is the way that he links the postmodern culture of media
images to the motif of the grotesque in art, literature and performance,
as a cultural expression moves from parody to self-parody, as something
becoming a parody or caricature of itself. We are living the historical
phase of the self-parody of the revered values of Western civilization.
[Simulation takes a major step forward from merely "the hyper-real
replacing the real" to the grotesque.]{.underline} [We are on the fast
track to what Baudrillard calls **carnivalization and
cannibalization**]{.underline}. [Carnivals were historically **very
political**]{.underline} [-- they were **parodies made of the powerful**
by the **oppressed**]{.underline}. [At festivals, the black African
colonized dressed up monkeys in admiral suits and hats to parody the
white colonizers]{.underline}.19 In Cologne and in the Rhineland region
of Germany, parody and mockery of the French and Prussian occupiers were
at the center of the carnival tradition that began in the nineteenth
century. But self-parody is something different. It occurs without
conscious intention. It is like what Karl Marx wrote in The Eighteenth
Brumaire of Louis Napoleon, writing about the French coup d'état of
1851, when Marx famously said: "Hegel remarks somewhere that all great
world-historic facts and personages appear, so to speak, twice. He
forgot to add: the first time as tragedy, the second time as farce."20
[To avoid having to give up the Presidency, **Louis-Napoléon [Bonaparte
staged a self-coup to stay in power]{.mark}**. He carried out
**Operation Rubicon** on the **anniversary** of his **uncle Napoleon's

unaware performer into debasement or abjection. [America sank into

[[America had no peers in its **fabrication** of **fantasies and

seriously perverse? [Donald Trump is the embodied metaphor of that

bring yourself down by]{.mark} the [endlessly looping video
image]{.mark} and the image-playback]{.underline}.22 After the tragic
event of September 11, 2001, the video footage of the implosion of the
World Trade Center twin towers was played back thousands of times over
and over again on TV in an endless loop, the eyes of the tele-spectators
fixed to the screen in perverse fascination. Baudrillard detected a
symbolism in the way that the two tallest buildings of the Manhattan
skyline collapsed or imploded in a visually suicidal motion, seemingly
responding in turn as a counter-gesture to the murder-suicides of the 19
terrorists.23 [The carnival of the image is also the
self-cannibalization by the image.]{.underline}24 An important precursor
of Trump playing the President on television and on Twitter was the
election of Arnold Schwarzenegger as governor of California in 2003. The
elevation to a powerful political post of the Mr. Olympia bodybuilder
and star of the Terminator series of science fiction films was a
not-so-surprising caricature of democracy. Reagan the Hollywood actor
and TV host of General Electric Theater had already been governor and
President. [Politics has been fully banalized into a game of idols and
fans, **the triumph of the celebrity culture**]{.underline}.25
Schwarzenegger would have certainly become President if not for the bad
luck of an antiquated clause in the Constitution which disqualified him
a priori on xenophobic grounds. [As we are now witnessing the probable
end of the Trump presidency -- and thinking with Baudrillard -- I
contemplate the contempt for the rest of the world which the Trump
supporters feel and express through their allegiance to

Springtime for Hitler For a long time, some Jewish theologians thought
that showing images of the Holocaust should be taboo, since the event
was the ultimate unrepresentable evil. Humanities theorists of
photography have sometimes argued generally that historical truth cannot
be depicted through visual images. Similarly, it was thought that Adolf
Hitler and the Nazis in the 1930s were so morally reprehensible that
parody or comedy or jokes about them should be taboo. In the 1967 film
The Producers made by Mel Brooks, bankrupt Broadway producer Max
Bialystock, played by Zero Mostel, needs to stage a musical that is
guaranteed to be a flop in order to carry out a complex scam to save
himself from financial ruin. Bialystock hits upon the apparently
ingenious idea of producing a musical comedy about Hitler and the Nazis.
It will be in such bad taste that the show is guaranteed to be panned by
the public and the theatre critics and to close in disgrace on opening
night. Yet to Bialystock's astonishment, the show is a smashing success.
The Broadway public finds Springtime for Hitler to be the funniest thing
in the world. Adolf Hitler is unintentionally brilliantly parodied by
deranged ex-Nazi Franz Liebkind. Due to the unexpected triumph,
Bialystock now paradoxically faces financial ruin and even prison.26 Is
**[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}** a fascist or is he the parody of
fascism? Here is my answer: he **[[is the parody of
fascism]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Yet he is also **the self-parody of
America**]{.underline} [and, at one step removed, of the **celebrated
values of the West**]{.underline}. Trump is the self-parody of the most
hyper-mediatized culture in the world: the culture of consumerism and
shopping mall no-place ambient spaces; television and advertising; [[the
media]{.mark}- and image-[saturated society of the
spectacle]{.mark}]{.underline}; **[[and]{.mark} the hyper-real [fantasy
aesthetics of Disneyland]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [As both the parody of
fascism and the self-parody of the post-World War II so-called American

#### **The real is dead. #Awkward.** 

**Baudrillard 81** (Jean, hates maps and mirror-people, "Simulacra and
Simulation", "The Precession of Simulacra", 1981)

[If]{.underline} once [we were able to view the Borges fable in which
[the cartographers]{.mark}]{.underline} of the Empire [[draw up a map so
detailed that it ends up covering the territory
exactly]{.underline}]{.mark} (the decline of the Empire witnesses the
fraying of this map, little by little, and its fall into ruins, though
some shreds are still discernible in the deserts - the metaphysical
beauty of this ruined abstraction testifying to a pride equal to the
Empire and rotting like a carcass, returning to the substance of the
soil, a bit as the double ends by being confused with the real through
aging) - as the most beautiful allegory of simulation[, [this fable
has]{.underline}]{.mark} [now [come full circle]{.mark} for us, and
possesses nothing but the discrete charm of second-order
simulacra]{.underline}.\*1 Today **[[abstraction is no longer that of
the map]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the double, the mirror, or the concept.
[[Simulation]{.mark} is no longer that of a territory, a referential
being, or a substance. It [is the generation by models of a real without
origin]{.mark} or reality: **[a hyperreal]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The
territory no longer precedes the map, nor does it survive it. It is
nevertheless [[the map that precedes the
territory]{.underline}]{.mark} - precession of simulacra - that
engenders the territory, and if one must return to the fable, today it
is the territory whose shreds slowly rot across the extent of the map.
[It is the real, and not the map, whose vestiges persist here and there
in the deserts that are no longer those of the Empire, but
ours]{.underline}. The desert of the real itself. In fact, even
inverted, Borges\'s fable is unusable. Only the allegory of the Empire,
perhaps, remains. Because [it is with this same imperialism that
[present-day simulators attempt to make the real,]{.mark} all of the
real, [coincide with their models of simulation]{.mark}]{.underline}.
But [it is no longer a question of either maps or
territories]{.underline}. [Something has disappeared]{.underline}: the
sovereign [[difference]{.underline}]{.mark}, between one and the other,
that constituted [the charm of abstraction]{.underline}. Because [it is
difference that constitutes the poetry of the map]{.underline} and the
charm of the territory, t[he magic of the concept and the charm of the
real]{.underline}. [This imaginary of representation]{.underline}, which
simultaneously culminates in and is engulfed by the cartographers mad
project of the ideal coextensivity of map and territory, [[disappears in
the simulation]{.underline}]{.mark} whose operation is nuclear and
genetic, no longer at all specular or discursive. It is all of
metaphysics that is lost. [[No more]{.underline}]{.mark} mirror of being
and appearances, [of the [real]{.mark} and its concept]{.underline}. No
more imaginary coextensivity: it is genetic miniaturization that is the
dimension of simulation[. [The real is]{.mark} produced
from]{.underline} miniaturized cells, matrices, and memory banks,
[models of control]{.underline} - and it can be reproduced an indefinite
number of times from these. It no longer needs to be rational, because
it no longer measures itself against either an ideal or negative
instance. **[It is [no longer anything but
operational]{.mark}.]{.underline}** In fact, it is no longer really the
real, because no imaginary envelops it anymore. [It is a
hyperreal]{.underline}, produced from a radiating synthesis of
combinatory models in a hyperspace without atmosphere. By crossing into
a space whose curvature is no longer that of the real, nor that of
truth, [the era of simulation is inaugurated by [a liquidation of all
referentials]{.mark}]{.underline} - worse: with their artificial
resurrection in the systems of signs, a material more malleable than
meaning, in that it lends itself to all systems of equivalences, to all
binary oppositions, to all combinatory algebra. [It is no longer a
question of imitation, nor duplication, nor even parody. It is a
question of substituting the signs of the real for the
real]{.underline}, that is to say of an operation of [deterring every
real process via its operational double]{.underline}, a programmatic,
metastable, perfectly descriptive machine that offers all the signs of
the real and short- circuits all its vicissitudes. [Never again will the
real have the chance to produce itself]{.underline} - such is the vital
function of the model in a system of death, or rather of anticipated
resurrection, that no longer even gives the event of death a chance. [A
hyperreal henceforth sheltered from the imaginary, and from any
distinction between the real and the imaginary]{.underline}, leaving
room only for the orbital recurrence of models and for the simulated
generation of differences.

#### Power is dead. #Awkward. 

**Baudrillard 81** (Jean, hates theatre and psychiatry, "Simulacra and
Simulation", 1981)

[It]{.underline} [would take too long to traverse the entire range of
the operational negativity of all those scenarios of
deterrence]{.underline}, [which]{.underline}, [like Watergate, [try to
regenerate a moribund principle through simulated scandal]{.mark},
phantasm, and murder]{.underline} - [a [sort of hormonal treatment
through negativity and crisis]{.mark}]{.underline}. [I[t is always a
question of proving]{.mark} the real through the imaginary, proving
[truth through scandal]{.mark}]{.underline}, [proving [the law through
transgression]{.mark}]{.underline}, [proving work through
striking]{.underline}, [proving [the system through
crisis]{.mark}]{.underline}, [and [capital through
revolution]{.mark}]{.underline}, as it is elsewhere (the Tasaday) of
proving ethnology through the dispossession of its object - without
taking into account: [the proof of theater through antitheater; the
proof of art through antiart]{.underline}; [the proof of pedagogy
through antipedagogy]{.underline}; [the proof of psychiatry through
antipsychiatry]{.underline}, etc. Everything [is metamorphosed into its
opposite to perpetuate itself in its expurgated form]{.underline}. [[All
the powers]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[all the institutions speak of
themselves through denial]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[in order to attempt,
by simulating death]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[to escape their real death
throes]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[Power can stage its own murder to
rediscover a glimmer of existence and legitimacy]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Such was the case with some American presidents: the Kennedys were
murdered because they still had a political dimension. The others,
Johnson, Nixon, Ford, only had the right to phantom attempts, to
simulated murders. [But this aura of an artificial menace was still
necessary to conceal that they were no longer anything but the
mannequins of power. [Formerly, the king]{.mark}]{.underline} [(also the
god]{.underline}) [[had to die]{.mark}, therein lay his
power]{.underline}. [[Today, he is miserably forced to feign
death]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[in order to preserve the blessing of
power]{.mark}. But it is lost]{.underline}. [[To seek new blood in its
own death]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[to renew the cycle through the mirror
of crisis, negativity, and antipower]{.mark}: this is the only
solution - alibi of every power, of every institution attempting to
break the vicious circle of its irresponsibility and of its fundamental
nonexistence, of its already seen and of its already dead.]{.underline}

#### Political activism is ubiquitous -- and thus meaningless. 

**Baudrillard 93** (Jean, I'm not doing the hates joke for this one,
"The Transparency of Evil", 1993)\*baudrillard doesn't mean what you
think he means by "transsexual"

- transsexuality means that signs of sexuality are proliferated beyond
  coherence and meaning, not related to transgender stuff

[[The possibility of metaphor is disappearing in every
sphere]{.underline}]{.mark}. This is an aspect of a general tendency
towards ~~transsexuality~~ which extends well beyond sex, [affecting all
disciplines]{.underline} as [[they lose their specificity]{.mark}
[and]{.mark}]{.underline} [[partake of a process of confusion]{.mark}
and contagion]{.underline} --- a viral loss of determinacy which is the
prime event among all the new events that assail us. [[Economics]{.mark}
[becomes transeconomics]{.mark}]{.underline},
[[aesthetics]{.underline}]{.mark} becomes
[[transaesthetics]{.underline}]{.mark}, ~~sex becomes transsexuality~~
--- [all [converge]{.mark} [in a]{.mark}]{.underline} transversal and
[[universal]{.underline} [process where]{.underline}]{.mark}[in [no
discourse may have a metaphorical relationship to
another]{.mark}]{.underline}, because [for there to be
metaphor]{.underline}, [differential fields and distinct objects must
exist]{.underline}. But they cannot exist where contamination is
possible between any discipline and any other. Total metonymy, then ---
viral by definition (or lack of definition). The viral analogy is not an
importation from biology, for everything is affected simultaneously and
under the same terms by the virulence in question, by the chain
-reaction we have been discussing, by haphazard and senseless
proliferation and metastasis. Perhaps our melancholy stems from this,
for [[metaphor]{.underline}]{.mark} still [[had its
beauty]{.underline}]{.mark}; [it was aesthetic,]{.underline}
[[playing]{.underline}]{.mark} as it did [[upon
difference]{.underline},]{.mark} [and [upon]{.mark} [the illusion of
difference]{.mark}]{.underline}. Today, metonymy .\~ replacing the whole
as well as the components, and occasioning a general commutability of
terms --- has built its -house upon the disillusion of metaphor. Thus
[[every individual category is subject to
contamination]{.underline}]{.mark}, [substitution is possible between
any sphere and any other]{.underline}: there is [a total confusion of
types]{.underline}. Sex is no longer located in sex itself, but
elsewhere --- everywhere else, in fact. [[Politics is no longer
restricted to the political sphere]{.underline}, [but infects every
sphere]{.underline}]{.mark} ---[economics]{.underline},
[science]{.underline}, art, sport\... Sport itself, meanwhile, is no
longer located in sport as such, but instead in business, in sex, in
politics, in the general style of performance. All these domains are
affected by sport's criteria of 'excellence', effort and
record-breaking, as by its childish notion of self-transcendence. Each
category thus passes through a phase transition during which its essence
is diluted in homeopathic doses, infinitesimal relative to the total
solution, until it finally disappears, leaving a trace so small as to be
indiscernible, like the 'memory of water'. AIDS is the reflection not so
much of an excess of sex or sexual pleasure as of sex's decompensation
through its general spread into all areas of life, its venting through
all the trivial variants of sexual incantation. The real loss of
immunity concerns sex as a whole, with the disappearance of sexual
difference and hence of sexuality per se. It is in this diffraction of
the sexual reality principle, at the fractal, micrological and non-human
level, that the essential confusion of the epidemic takes hold. Perhaps
we still have a memory of sex, rather as water 'remembers' molecules no
matter how diluted. But that is the whole point: [this is only a
molecular memory]{.underline}, [the corpuscular memory of an earlier
life]{.underline}, [and not a memory of forms or
singularities]{.underline} (water, after all, can hardly retain the
features of a face, or the colour of someone's eyes). So what we are
left with is the simple imprint of a faceless sexuality infinitely
watered down in a broth of politics, media and communications, and
eventually manifested in the viral explosion of AIDS. [[The law that is
imposed on us is]{.mark} the law [of the confusion of
categories]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Everything is sexual]{.underline}.
Everything is [political]{.underline}. Everything is
[aesthetic]{.underline}. [All at once]{.underline}. [Everything has
acquired a [political meaning]{.mark}]{.underline}, especially since
1968; and it is not just everyday life but also madness,
[[language]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[the media]{.underline}]{.mark}, even
desire, that [[are politicized as they enter the sphere of
liberation]{.underline}]{.mark}, the [sphere of mass
processes]{.underline}. Likewise [everything has become
sexual]{.underline}, [anything can be an object of desire]{.underline}:
[power]{.underline}, [knowledge]{.underline} --- everything is
interpreted in terms of phantasies, in terms of repression, and sexual
stereotypy reigns in every last corner. Likewise, too, [everything is
now aestheticized]{.underline}: [politics is aestheticized in the
spectacle]{.underline}, [sex in advertising and porn]{.underline}, and
[all kinds of activity in what is conventionally referred to as
culture]{.underline} --- a sort of all-pervasive media- and
advertising-led semiologization: '[[culture degree
Xerox']{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Each category]{.mark} is generalized to
the greatest possible extent]{.underline}, so that [it]{.underline}
eventually [[loses all specificity]{.mark} and [is reabsorbed by all the
other categories]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[When everything is
political]{.mark}, [nothing is political any more]{.mark}]{.underline},
[[the word itself is meaningless]{.underline}]{.mark}. [When everything
is sexual]{.underline}, [[nothing is sexual]{.underline}]{.mark} any
more, and [sex loses its determinants]{.underline}. [When everything is
aesthetic]{.underline}, [[nothing is beautiful or ugly any
more]{.underline}]{.mark}, and [art itself disappears]{.underline}.
[This paradoxical state of affairs]{.underline}, which is simultaneously
the complete actualization of an idea, the perfect realization of the
whole tendency of modernity, and [the negation of that idea and that
tendency]{.underline}, [[their annihilation by virtue of their very
success]{.underline}]{.mark}, [by virtue of their extension beyond their
own bounds]{.underline} --- [this state of affairs is epitomized by a
single figure]{.underline}: [the transpolitical, the ~~transsexual~~,
the transaesthetic.]{.underline}

### 'Real' Countries/Soverignty

#### **Insistence that some countries are "real" is a knee-jerk reaction to a hyperreal condition of globalization that destabilizes the nation-state. Viewing the nation-state as the antidote to hyperreality and ontological uncertainty culminates in the worst modes of nationalist and colonialist violence.** 

**Richardson 19** (Paul B. Prof. in the School of Geography, Earth and
Environmental Sciences, University of Birmingham, "Sovereignty, the
Hyperreal, and "Taking Back Control," Annals of the American Association
of Geographers, 109:6, 1999-2003; 2006-2009)

**[In a world of enhanced ontological insecurity--- and the ever more
rapid and dramatic destabilization of identities, economies, and
political communities---sovereignty has emerged seemingly unscathed,
unshakeable, and immutable in the imaginaries of populist
politicians]{.underline}** (e.g., Hall 2016; May 2016a; Haldevang 2017;
Ocampo 2018; Trump 2018; on ontological insecurity, see Giddens 1991;
Rumelili 2014). [Sovereignty remains absolute in a world of
inversions,]{.underline} where borders have become the center of spatial
imaginaries; "tradition," imperial legacies, and origin myths are the
future; and "taking back control" masks a disconcerting sense of
insignificance and irrelevance. This article presents possibilities for
an exit from the illusionary idyll of absolute sovereignty by drawing on
Baudrillard's notion of hyperreality to open up new terrains of thinking
and practice. It suggests that **[through a condition of hyperreality we
can explore alternative ways of approaching sovereignty and perhaps
reach beyond its enduring presence as an irreducible principle of the
world system.]{.underline}**

Notions of sovereignty in crisis are not particularly new to the
literature (Sidaway 2003). Many have already noted that **[[a
sovereign-spatial order premised on a]{.mark} "claim to [final and
ultimate authority]{.mark} over a political community" [has long been
undercut by]{.mark} multiple factors, such as "national" currency values
and interest rates being determined by the decisions of [inter- national
markets,]{.mark} political citizenship reconfigured through calls for
[nonterritorial forms of citizenship, and]{.mark} the granting of
sovereignty to [institutions that transcend
states]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Flint 2009, 707; Russell 2005). [The
European Union (EU), for example, has been indicative of]{.underline}
what Agnew (2005) termed [an integrative sovereignty regime,
whereby]{.underline} [many of the founding states of the Westphalian
system have "thrown in their lot with one another" to create a larger
entity that "challenges existing state sovereignty in functionally
complex and oftentimes nonterritorial ways"]{.underline} (445).

Jones and Johnson (2016, 194) highlight how Sassen (2006) has charted
the "partial 'unbundling' of the key constitutive ties between
territory, authority, and rights that made up modern nation-states"
whereby **[the "unitary character of nation-states" has eroded due to
the "rise of various cross-border regimes, instantaneous and
difficult-to-regulate capital flows, and new assemblages of decision
making power."]{.underline}** Sovereignty is itself a term that has
evolved to accommodate new entities, with Krasner (1999) arguing that
international system norms, "including those associated with Westphalian
sovereignty and international legal sovereignty, have always been
characterized by organized hypocrisy" (220), while others, such as Luke
(1996), have outlined a decentering of sovereign authorities and a
post--Cold War world made up of "unfixed 'sovran' authorities against
fixed 'sovereign' rule" (500).

**[Why, then, if sovereignty can no longer be seen as the exclusive
domain of the state]{.underline}**---and in many regards never was
(Agnew 1998)---**[has there not been a corresponding shift in the way in
which the political-territorial order is imagined]{.underline}** (Agnew
2005, 2009; Murphy 2013)? **[Even [as sovereignty's material and
functional relevance has been destabilized,]{.mark} deconstructed, and
dislocated in academic debates, [it has]{.mark} at the same moment
[become imagined by political classes as ever more]{.mark} precise and
[perfect]{.mark}.]{.underline}** This article interprets **[[this
disjuncture]{.mark} as \[[is\] a shift to the hyperreal---a condition
that denies all of sovereignty's contradictions and inconsistencies
and]{.mark} one that [prevents]{.mark} politicians, [political
actors]{.mark}, and populations [from acknowledging]{.mark} and
negotiating [disconcerting transformations in the sociospatial
order]{.mark}.]{.underline}** What follows is a theoretical engagement
with notions of the hyperreal and sovereignty, which are then explored
through the case studies of Brexit and the "America First" presidency of
Donald Trump.

Sovereignty and the Hyperreal

Drawing on the body of work associated with Baudrillard (1976, 1978,
1980, 1983, 1985, 1988, 1994, 2004, 2006), and multiple interpretations
of this work (e.g., Luke 1991a, 1991b; Merrin 1994; Weber 1995, 2017;
Debrix 1999; Gane 2003; Hussey 2003; Rubenstein 2008; Lane 2009; Hehir
2011; Lundborg 2016; Lalonde 2018), **[the hyperreal is]{.underline}**
broadly understood in this article as **[a simulated world coming to
replace reality; where a consciousness of things has become corrupted by
a perception of something that never existed; and where the image of
this world becomes imbued with characteristics it has never had and
could not possess]{.underline}** (see Hehir 2011). **[[A hyperreal
interpretation of sovereignty emphasizes its idealized image]{.mark} and
the ways in which [this distracts and conceals inherent contradictions
and hypocrisies]{.mark}. In the realm of the [hyperreal, sovereignty
demands increasing attention]{.mark}, iteration, and visibility, yet all
the [while its disintegration]{.mark} and deterritorialization
[accelerate.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

To date, surprisingly few studies have attempted to relate the state of
the hyperreal to sovereignty (although on hyppereality's wider
applicability to international politics see, e.g., Der Derian 1990; Luke
1991a, 1996; Merrin 1994; Hehir 2011; Lundborg 2016). What follows in
this article is an explanation of how, in terms of sovereignty,
**[citizens of advanced mediacracies have "lost the ability to
distinguish between the model and the real"]{.underline}** (Der Derian
1990, 299). To illustrate our condition of the hyperreal, this article
turns to an analysis of [recent declarations and speeches on sovereignty
by populist politicians and political elites, as well as media
commentary and opinion reflecting on these pronouncements and
policies.]{.underline} Using examples drawn from the United States and
the United Kingdom, the aim is to analyze and interpret [the ways in
which the distinction between the real and its representation begin to
be effaced]{.underline} (Gane 2003). Or, in Baudrillard's terms, when it
becomes a Simulacra: **["a copy of a copy which has been so repeatedly
acknowledged, referred to and disseminated, that it has come to be
accepted as more real than the original"]{.underline}** (Baudrillard
1994, 2).

Baudrillard (1985, 11, cited in Bleiker 2002) traces the annihilation of
reality in stages, whereby "**[the distinctions between]{.underline}**
reality and virtuality, **[political practice and simulation are blurred
to the extent that they are no longer recognisable."]{.underline}** In a
world of media saturation and obsession, "electronic mediations of
experience and meaning substitute the imaginary for the real" (Luke
1991b, 358). For Baudrillard, this occurs over four successive phases of
the image: First as a reflection of a basic reality; second, the image
masking and perverting of a basic reality; third, masking the absence of
a basic reality; and, in its fourth and final stage, it "bears no
relation to any reality whatever: it is its own pure simulacrum"
(Baudrillard 1985, as cited in Bleiker 2002). In this final stage, in a
condition of the hyperreal, "no adequate analysis of systems of
representation can simply refer to the 'real' world, as if this was
unproblematic," because "in each phase of representation a former,
dominant conception of the 'real' is taken as the reference model of
'current' reality" (Gane 2003, 95). It is through these successive
phases of the image that "the model takes the place of the 'real'"
(Baudrillard 1976, 100, cited in Gane 2003, 97).

To illustrate the point, Baudrillard drew on Jorge Luis Borges's fable
of imperial cartographers who create a map of such perfection that it
overlays the entire territory of the empire, only to be left by sub-
sequent generations to ruin by the elements until all that remains are
frayed and tattered fragments in the empire's distant deserts. For
Baudrillard (\[1981\] 1988) the lesson is this:

[The territory no longer precedes the map, nor survives it. Henceforth,
it is the map that precedes the territory---precession of simulacra---it
is the map that engenders the territory and if we were to revive the
fable today, it would be the territory whose shreds are slowly rotting
across the map. It is the real, and not the map, whose vestiges subsist
here and there, in the deserts which are no longer those of the Empire,
but our own. The desert of the real itself.]{.underline} (166, italics
in original)

The map's precedence to territory has not escaped the attention of
geographers, with Elden (2005) noting how we find ourselves in
circumstances where "the abstract space we have imposed over the world
is taken more and more as real in itself, rather than as a reflection of
something below it, something that it seeks to represent" (15--16). For
Baudrillard (\[1981\] 1988), "[It is no longer a question of either maps
or territory. \... It is no longer a question of imitation, nor of
reduplication, nor even of parody. It is rather a question of
substituting signs of the real for the real itself"]{.underline}
(166--67).

This article suggests that **[the sovereign image and imaginary is
increasingly taken for the real, as the distinction between the real and
the imaginary--- between truth and untruth---is
annihilated.]{.underline}** In response to this world of hyperreality
and hyper- space, Baudrillard (\[1981\] 1988) suggested that

where the real is no longer what it used to be, nostalgia assumes its
full meaning. There is a proliferation of myths of origin and signs of
reality; of second-hand truth, objectivity and authenticity. \... It is
no longer a question of a false representation of reality (ideology),
but of concealing the fact that the real is no longer real, and thus of
saving the reality principle. (171--72)

To chart the demise of the real, Baudrillard (\[1981\] 1988) drew on the
examples of Disneyland---and its presentation of an "imaginary in order
to make us believe that the rest is real"---and the Watergate
affair---"a scandal-effect" concealing the fact that the scandal is not
the aberration but the norm (171--73). **[In the case of
[sovereignty]{.mark}, it[s invocation as absolute conceals a reality
principle in distress,]{.mark} a striving "to revive a moribund
principle" through simulation by "proving the real by the
imaginary"]{.underline}** (176--77). **[[Attempts to reanimate
sovereignty with realness and relevance]{.mark} abound. The spell of
sovereignty becomes a trick demonstrating how "simulation corresponds to
a short-circuit of reality and to its reduplication by signs"; [a false
promise "to restore the truth beneath the
simulacrum"]{.mark}]{.underline}** (182). If institutions like
parliaments, governments, and their bureaucracies were once the
representatives of the sovereignty of the people (see Debrix \[1999\] on
Rousseau 1973; and Locke 1982), then, **[in the sovereignty of the
hyperreal]{.underline}**---under conditions of simulation---"**[it is no
longer possible to distinguish between a good and a bad representation,
a correct or an erroneous interpretation, a truth or a falsehood. \...
The simulacrum, the real of/in simulation, is no longer the product of
interpretive mechanisms, but, rather, the outcome of operative
media"]{.underline}** (Debrix 1999, 12).

For Debrix (1999), such a shift in our ways of perceiving the
"objective" world (reality) is revolutionary: "The Cartesian cogito has
truly been superseded. New relations of perception and knowledge have
arisen. \... \[I\]n simulation, visual signs lie. Or, they may tell the
truth. \... What is real is what, as Baudrillard puts it, is hyperreal"
(210). In this sense **[the binary of hyperreal (appearance or
falsehood) versus real (actuality or truth) collapses. The state of the
hyperreal is no longer the illusion, and the real no longer affirms the
truth. Appearance and actuality are no longer poles apart but instead
fused together.]{.underline}** In such conditions, and drawing on
Baudrillard, Lundborg (2016) suggested, "**[Only when simulation is the
master does the desire for total sovereignty become possible; only then
can all ambivalence be removed; and only then does the world as such
become 'perfectly impossible']{.underline}**" (264; see also Baudrillard
and Noailles 2007; Lalonde 2018).

**[[The conditions for]{.mark} total, [absolute sovereignty emerge in
the proliferation of hyperreal environments, in]{.mark} the form of
[geographical information systems, war game simulations, global
television emissions, and cinematic sign systems]{.mark}]{.underline}**
(O Tuathail 1996), [all of which constitute a virtual world in which the
absolute becomes possible]{.underline}. Hehir (2011) explored such "a
simulated world" whereby our perception of things is "corrupted by a
perception of a reality that never existed. Thus entities and phenomena
are imbued with characteristics they do not and cannot have, yet are
treated as though they do" (1073). Hehir (2011) focused on **[[the
desire of the West to create "liberal" and "democratic" political
communities in the developing world which mirror idealized, unreal and
unrealized visions of the Western state]{.mark}. Within this conceit of
perfection, [sovereignty becomes]{.mark} presented as an ever more
"idealized composite image"]{.underline}** (1074), **[a simulated form
and ["a virtual universe from which everything dangerous]{.mark} and
negative [has been expelled"]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Baudrillard 2004,
as cited in Hehir 2011, 1078). **[[All threats]{.mark} and challenges
[are externalized]{.mark} beyond the unity and inviolable ideal of
absolute sovereignty, which has become "an almost uncontestable article
of faith despite the evidence to the contrary," a universal good
"legitimised as progressive and emancipatory"]{.underline}** (Hehir
2011, 1078).1

Ince and Barrera de la Torre (2016) reflected more broadly on such
articles of faith, suggesting that **[much to the detriment of equality
and social justice, statism]{.underline}**---which in their terms is
**["an integrated set of [socially-embedded organisational logics
establish]{.mark}ing [the state as the]{.mark} dominant [model of
governing society]{.mark}"---has shaped, [and continue]{.mark}s [to
shape,]{.mark} "geographical [epistemologies,]{.mark} producing
structures of knowing that can generate epistemic distance between
representations of the world and immanent experiences of
it"]{.underline}** (17). The examples of **[[hyperreality and
sovereignty]{.underline}]{.mark}** that follow **[speak to this broader
aspiration of freeing geographical epistemologies from statism's
restrictive patterns of thought and reflection. They [seek to move
beyond]{.mark} the "double- move" of state making and its tendency to
illuminate ["ontological uncertainty]{.mark}]{.underline}** (about
identity, space, time and meaning) **[\[while\] [positing the
sovereign]{.mark} state [as the solution to]{.mark} that
[uncertainty"]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Dunn 2010, 86).

To progress beyond such a double move means first recognizing the state
of **[the hyperreal]{.underline}** and the condition of postmodernity
that paradoxically maintains and sustains an illusionary territoriality
of the modern. It **[is a state whereby [sovereignty becomes ever more
absurd and delusional, an ever more vivid and valorized]{.mark} image no
matter what shifts and reconfigurations take place in the
political-territorial order.]{.underline}** Brown (2017) noted such a
process in the case of **[border walls,]{.underline}** suggesting that
they **["function as symbolic and semiotic responses to crises produced
by eroded sovereign state capacities to secure territory, citizens and
economies against growing transnational flows of power, people, capital,
religions, ideas or terror"]{.underline}** (2). Yet, for Brown, **[these
"walls do not merely index but accelerate waning state
sovereignty"]{.underline}** (2). **[They represent "a last vestige of a
dying system of territorially bounded sovereignty]{.underline}** (Brown
2010)" (Jones and Johnson 2017, 2), "**[a political-theatrical response
to eroding nation-state sovereignty]{.underline}** (Brown 2010)" (Brown
2017, 2)---**[a territory of the real "whose shreds are slowly rotting
across the map"]{.underline}** (Baudrillard \[1981\] 1988, 166).

Over the following pages, two case studies are explored, which highlight
**[the (il)logic of]{.underline}** sovereignty and how the evocative
imaginings and invocations of **[a pure and absolute sovereignty belie
an impossible and fantastical fiction.]{.underline}** In the case of
**[Britain's decision to leave the EU and the election of Donald
Trump,]{.underline}** this article **[highlight]{.underline}**s the
significance of Baudrillard's work for guiding research about "national"
sovereignty and **[democratic decisions driven by false hopes,
resentments, and unrealizable promises. In two of the world's leading
liberal capital- ist democracies, voters cast their ballots to affirm a
hyperreal sense of the absolute sovereignty of imag- ined national
communities. Leaving the EU or electing a billionaire reality TV star
appeared to equate to "taking back control" and somehow a recovery of
full sovereignty]{.underline}**. In the realm of Brexit and Trump, the
scale, scope, and speed of simulation generation is all- immersive and
all-pervasive. Through leading the TV news day after day, front-page
coverage, nocturnal tweets, and never-ending live feeds, all audiences
are consumed and subsumed as the hyperreality of taking back control
inundates the empirical.2

\[...\]

America First

**[The sovereignty delusion]{.underline}** is by no means restricted to
Brexit as the blurring of fact and fiction, and of eality and illusion,
**[has been accelerated in the United States with the ascendency to the
presidency of reality TV star, Donald Trump]{.underline}** (for examples
beyond Brexit, see Dunn 2010; Backman 2011; Cocks 2014; Juss 2017). In
our age of the hyperreal**[, Trump has been called a "sovereign father"
for our times]{.underline}** (Connelly 2016), **[a leader who has risen
on the tide of a sovereignty myth.]{.underline}** It was a myth outlined
by Trump at some length during his maiden speech to the United Nations
General Assembly in September 2017 in which sovereignty dominated and
defined his address, with the words sovereign and sovereignty men-
tioned twenty-one times (Tatar 2017). In the speech, Trump repeatedly
equated sovereignty with global harmony, declaring, "Our success depends
on a coalition of strong and independent nations that embrace their
sovereignty, to promote security, prosperity, and peace, for themselves
and for the world" (Haldevang 2017). He declared that "strong, sovereign
nations allow individuals to flourish in the fullness of the life
intended by God" (Miller 2018) and talked of a "great reawakening of
nations, for the revival of their spirits, their pride, their people,
and their patriotism." That this has historically not been a recipe for
"harmony and friendship" went unnoted in the speech (Chhabra 2017).

In the Washington Post, Jaffe and DeYoung (2017) suggested that in his
appearance at the United Nations, **[Trump had "cast his presidency as
an avatar of international renewal," a catalyst for a renewed patriotic
spirit, national self-interest and cooperation among sovereign nations,
which are posited as the solution for all international
ills.]{.underline}** Trump asked in his speech, "Are we still patriots?
Do we love our nations enough to protect their sovereignty and take
ownership of their future?" **[He also invoked sovereignty to attack the
"mammoth multinational trade deals" that have supposedly empowered
faceless global bureaucracies over nation-states, sent factory jobs
overseas, and hollowed out the middle class]{.underline}** (Jaffe and De
Young 2017). **[[Trump]{.mark} railed against the "unaccountable
international tribunals and powerful global bureaucracies" that sap the
sovereignty of nations]{.underline}** (Jaffe and De Young 2017) and as a
counter offered a passionate and populist defense of the principles of
sovereignty and patriotism, which in his words could spark a "rebirth of
devotion" across the world (Jaffe and De Young 2017). **[It [is a
devotion to a sovereign idyll and illusion through a missionary zeal
anchored in the ether of hyperreality.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

As Nasr pointed out, Trump's definition of sovereignty in the speech is
derived "from a very narrow domestic prism" (cited in Landler 2017) out
of which the United States emerges as the first among equals. It is a
foreign policy doctrine that has been interpreted by some as the fusion
of sovereigntism with "a style of big-power nationalism" and, in an echo
of earlier presidencies, one that has been labeled by the president and
his advisors as "principled realism" and "America first" (Bierman and
Lauter 2017). For Patrick (2017a) **[it represents an invocation of
sovereignty to "assert universal truths and to deflect messy
realities."]{.underline}** Patrick suggested that
**[Trump]{.underline}**'s speech **[should be seen as part of a broader
"sovereigntist" critique of the global order, which has been evident in
policy stances from leaving the Paris Climate Agreement, to renouncing
the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and the criticism of alliances like NATO,
through to threats to ignore the World Trade Organization, and
moratoriums on any new multilateral treaties]{.underline}** (Patrick
2017b).

It is **[[in Trump]{.mark}'s sovereigntist agenda]{.underline}** that
**[[we glimpse a mourning for the waning of U.S. hegemony]{.mark} in the
face of "messy realities," [a lament for the absence of power,
which]{.mark} "for some time now [produces nothing but signs of its
resemblance]{.mark} \...; an obsession with its death; an obsession with
its survival which becomes greater the more it
disappears]{.underline}**" (Baudrillard \[1981\] 1988, 180). Baudrillard
(\[1981\] 1988) wrote of **[a "\[m\]elancholy for societies without
power," whereby ["power is no longer present except to conceal that
there is none"]{.mark}]{.underline}** (180--81). **[It is [out of this
melancholy for power, and a rage against its loss,]{.mark} that [the
sovereigntist agenda can materialize in ever more disturbing
ways]{.mark}]{.underline}**. One such moment occurred on 4 April 2018,
with the release of a memo by Trump titled, "**[Securing the Southern
Border of the United States]{.underline}**," in which National Guard
troops were ordered to the U.S.--Mexico bor- der in response to a
"caravan" of refugees traveling to the United States from Central
America (Jacobs 2018). The first paragraph **[sets the scene of a
sovereignty principle in crisis]{.underline}**:

1\) The security of the United States is imperiled by a drastic surge of
illegal activity on the southern border. Large quantities of fentanyl,
other opioids, and other dangerous and illicit drugs are flowing across
our southern border and into our country at unprecedented levels,
destroying the lives of our families and loved ones. \... Deadly
transnational gangs are systematically exploiting our unsecured southern
border to enter our country and develop operational capacity in American
communities throughout the country. The anticipated rapid rise in
illegal crossings as we head into the spring and summer months threatens
to overwhelm our Nation's law enforcement capacities. (Trump 2018,
italics added)

The memo stresses a border regime where the ability to ensure the
sovereignty of the nation is in doubt (see Miller \[2018\] on Trump's
preference for the term nation), with it suggesting that "our American
way of life hinges on our ability as a Nation to adequately and
effectively enforce our laws and protect our borders. A key and
undeniable attribute of a sovereign nation is the ability to control who
and what enters its territory" (Trump 2018). Throughout the memo a
sovereignty principle in crisis is invoked, with paragraphs 4 and 5
warning, "The lawlessness that continues at our southern border is
fundamentally incompatible with the safety, security, and sovereignty of
the American people. \... the highest sovereign duty of the President is
to defend this Nation, which includes the defense of our borders" (Trump
2018). **[The memo's unsubtle generation of [an existential threat to
"our American way of life" works to regenerate the sovereign nation; it
strives to revive a moribund "moral and political principle \... in
distress"]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Baudrillard \[1981\] 1988, 172--73).
**[[From it emerges a pure and perfect U.S. sovereignty that contrasts
with the disorder and chaos beyond,]{.mark} "a simulated real, which
henceforth supplants the real and is its final solution, a virtual
universe from which everything dangerous and negative has been
expelled"]{.underline}** (Baudrillard 2004).

To maintain the illusion of sovereign perfection, in June 2018 children
of asylum seekers were separated from their parents at the U.S. border,
as Trump declared, "The United States will not be a migrant camp \...
You look at what's happening in other places---we can't allow that to
happen to the United States. Not on my watch" (Gambino and Lartey 2018).
**[In the simulated sovereignty of Trump's America First, the
"circulation of hyperreal signs of his ability and often his ability
alone \... deliver what he defines as truly in the US national
interest"]{.underline}** (Weber 2017, S-137, italics added; on Trump
scripting himself as the superhero, see Dittmer 2018). In one sense,
Trump is a continuation of U.S. presidents since Ronald Reagan who have
each told us "a meta-theoretical story about Baudrillardian sign theory
where presidents \... mark different moments of the simulacrum"
(Rubenstein 2008, 11). For example, on George W. Bush's presidency,
Suskind (2004) outlined a faith-based administration with a disdain for
"the reality-based community." A senior advisor to Bush at the time,
stated to Suskind: "We're an empire now, and when we act, we create our
own reality. And while you're studying that reality---judiciously, as
you will---we'll act again, creating other new realities, which you can
study too, and that's how things will sort out." Suskind described a
presidency of "unflinching confidence \[that\] has an almost mystical
power. It can all but create reality."3

**[Trump is also a continuation and confirmation of the practice of
"statecraft as mancraft"]{.underline}** (Weber 2016, 4; see also Ashley
1989), **[whereby the sovereign foundation of the modern state is
presented as a "phantastical yet presumed-to-be-factual 'sovereign
man'---as if it were the singular, preexisting, ahistorical ground that
authorizes all sovereign decisions in its political
community"]{.underline}** (Weber 2016, 4--5). Applied to our own
phantastical times, Trump as sovereign man could claim on 5 April
2018---without any corroborating evidence---that in the caravan of
refugees "women are raped at levels that nobody has ever seen before"
(cited in Z. B. Wolf 2018). Then, in October 2018, as a group of mainly
Honduran asylum seekers moved through Mexico toward the U.S. border,
Trump called it an "onslaught of illegal aliens" (Darrah 2018). On 31
October he tweeted, "We will NOT let these Caravans, which are also made
up of some very bad thugs and gang members, into the U.S. Our Border is
sacred" (Evans 2018). In a speech at the White House on the same day,
Trump added that if "they want to throw rocks at our military, our
military fights back. I told them to consider it a rifle" (Weaver and
Manson 2018). **[In such hypermasculine declarations and denunciations,
[a state of crisis and threat becomes the norm]{.mark}---a form of
"banal geopolitics," whereby [crises and extreme remedy become]{.mark}
"nothing out of the ordinary," ["routine,"]{.mark} "normal,
taken-for-granted geopolitics"]{.underline}** (Sidaway 2001, 606--7).

These episodes also recall Brown's interpretation of **[border walls and
their paraphernalia and performance "as [symbolic and semiotic responses
to crises]{.mark}]{.underline}**" (R. Jones et al. 2017, 2). For against
Trump's refrain that "a secure border is a sovereign right" (Swoyer
2016), Anderson (2018) noted in The San Diego Union- Tribune that the
immense efforts at securitizing the U.S.--Mexico border have **[[had the
counterfunction of]{.underline}]{.mark}**

**[[jeopardizing U.S.]{.mark} sovereignty and human [security]{.mark} as
"\[s\]trong, militarized enforcement has resulted in a stronger
militarized response by well-financed drug cartels and increased
corruption, violence and death, but not a decrease in the flow of
drugs."]{.underline}**

**[Extreme violence and discipline were anticipated]{.underline}** by
Baudrillard (\[1981\] 1988), who noted that **[[power threatened by
simulation]{.mark} "risks the real, [risks crisis, it gambles on
remanufacturing]{.mark} artificial, [social, economic, political
stakes.]{.mark} This is a question of life or death for
it"]{.underline}** (180). **[It also becomes a question of life and
death for those caught in the "collective demand for signs of power---a
holy union which forms around the disappearance of power"]{.underline}**
(180). In the desert of "Making America Great Again" are the drowned of
the Rio Grande and the missing of the arid U.S.--Mexico
borderlands---**[victims of a melancholy for a society without power.
While hyperreality's scenario of power conceals the fact that the real
power has disappeared]{.underline}** (Baudrillard \[1981\] 1988),
**[[simulation does not exclude the violent counterconvulsions of a
sovereign tormented by the ebb of its power]{.mark}.]{.underline}** As
Baudrillard (1983) insisted, **[[the simulacrum of war does not make it
"any less heinous]{.mark} for being a mere simulacrum---[the flesh
suffers just the same,]{.mark} and [the dead]{.mark} ex-combatants
[count as much]{.mark} there as in other wars"]{.underline}** (70, cited
in Merrin 1994, 444). **[A condition of [the hyperreal makes
possible]{.mark} absolute sovereign authority and with it [the full
realization of sovereignty's devastating foundational logic---the
operation of a binary of those who are protected and those who could
legitimately die]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Agamben 1998).

For Weber (2017), **[[the Trump "campaign and presidency are part and
parcel of]{.mark} earlier historical 'experiments'---in [white, Western,
heteropatriarchal authoritarian leadership, in neoliberalism]{.mark} and
the specific modalities of citizenship, governance and
reason"]{.underline}** (S-134; see also Adorno et al. 1950; Brown 2003;
Bauman 2016; Connelly 2016). Weber saw **[Trump's simulated form as
president [as akin to]{.mark}]{.underline}** Badiou's (2001) description
of **[[the function of the simulacrum under
Nazism:]{.underline}]{.mark}**

**[[in which a hyperreal national allegiance to the self- referential
simulacrum as heteropatriarchal leader piles]{.mark} specific [fictions
upon fictions]{.mark}. It does so not only to mask \... the absence of
the reality principle but [to generate a dangerous, materializable,
national fantasy that depends upon]{.mark} particularizing, identifying
and [regulating abstract allies and enemies.]{.mark}]{.underline}** (74;
see also Weber 2017, S-135)

For Weber**[, Trump "opposes the 'righteous' to the 'unrighteous', who
he variously named during the campaign as all or many of 'the blacks',
'the gays', 'the Mexican rapists' and the 'radical Islamic
terrorists'"]{.underline}** (Weber 2017, S-136). In her polemic, Weber
highlighted how **[simulation and dissimulation "re-code sovereignty
\... in the name of that particular abstract set of sovereign US
subjects on whose behalf the administration (pretends to) claim(s) its
authority to rule---'righteous Americans'"]{.underline}** (Weber 2017,
S-138). **[In a haze of "fake news" and "alternative
facts"]{.underline}** (which are read by some as "real news") **[the
administration's strategy is one "that attempts to overwhelm US
democracy with \... representations, simulations and dissimulations of
facts and fictions, so all that remains intact is the authority of Trump
and Trump as our authoritarian leader"]{.underline}** (Weber 2017,
S-137--39). **[[These hyperreal simulations]{.mark} and dissimulations
of sovereignty are far from intangible, unreal, or benign but
[effectively maintain violent exclusionary hierarchies through
privileging "righteous Americans"]{.mark} and the elevation of "a
particular people and its mode of life [above those marked as
alien"]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Cocks 2014, 3; Weber 2017, 136**[). It is
out of the sovereignty of the hyperreal that there emerge new terrains
and possibilities for the "violent reactivation of a form of power that
despairs of its rational foundations"]{.underline}** (Baudrillard 1980,
110, cited in Kroker 1984, 58).

### Russia

#### The 1AC's presentation of Russia is a social construction of westernized political interest that creates endless war 

Anton **Agafonov 10**, Political Science MA Program at the University of
Ottawa, "Western 'Security Community' and Russia: Mutual Construction of
Insecurities", Masters Thesis, July, 2010 🐸

[The neo-liberal institutionalist approach seems to be insufficient in
explaining]{.mark} the failure of creating a common \"greater European
cultural and humanitarian space\" exceeding the institutional framework
of the EU or NATO. [Nor does it fully explain the generally [negative
dynamics of the Russia-West relations during the past two
decades]{.mark}, despite]{.underline} [Russia\'s growing and relatively
strong functional]{.mark} [participation in both inclusive international
mechanisms (e.g. OSCE, PACE) and exclusive ones]{.underline} (e.g.
NATO), as well as cooperation at the non-state level (cf Keohane et al.
1995). It is [possible to suggest that \"othering\" is the key to the
explaining the negative dynamics,]{.underline} which neo-liberal
institutionalists tend not to focus on. [[Scholars representing the
constructivist school, stressing the social construction of knowledge,
and political interest, identities, norms, values as its
derivatives]{.underline}]{.mark}, in my view, furnish a better
explanation of how the decades\' (if not centuries\') [old pattern of
relations has been sustained]{.underline} despite the multitude of
political developments with global repercussions that changed both the
global and domestic politics. [This argument can be substantiated by the
growing role of the discursive in the domain of international
relations[. Discourses can produce and reproduce a particular reality in
the international relations rendering certain]{.mark}]{.underline}
political options possible or impossible at both international and
domestic levels. The discourses of \"othering\" or 4 Master\'s Thesis
Anton Agafonov \"integration\" represent an obvious practical value and
may be instrumental in explaining dynamics of international relations[.
For example, [as applied to the Russian-Western relations, it is quite
evident that the ideological conflicts of the Cold War period have been
largely replaced by discursive clashes over identities and histories
between Russia and the West involving recourse to such vague
terms]{.mark}]{.underline} as \"cultural and civilizational choice,\" or
\"Europeanness.\" National historiographies often serve as tools
employed in debates over state (national) and collective identities,
which suggests that history is often more of a political instrument,
rather than a science. [Histories, just like current political
developments (or a very recent history) are often \"known as they were
narrated, not as they were in reality.\" Outcomes of such \"virtual
space wars\" resulting in \"virtual and declaratory\" victories or
debacles are quite comparable to those caused by real wars: tangible
spatial and cultural lines of separation akin to the Berlin
Wall]{.underline}. In short, discourses, historicized narratives and
mythologies associated with national identities and histories have
become as [strong a weapon for attaining domestic and international
political objectives as \"hard power\" capabilities. [National
discourses on Russia are abundant with examples of broadcasting
historical narratives varying from the
statement]{.mark}]{.underline}[s]{.mark} expressing the historical
resentments of the East-European and Baltic leadership to the statements
of [the US and West European political and expert
community]{.underline}.2 The promotion of particular historical
narratives by national professional and foreign policy communities can
be considered instrumental in [achieving goals that pragmatic interests
dictate. For example, the timing of re-emergence of debates over
histories and identities 2 The recent example thereto is drawing
historical parallels of Russia\'s \"aggression]{.underline}\" against
Georgia and Soviet suppression of uprisings in the Eastern and Central
Europe (e.g. Condoleezza Rice\'s 2008 statement on RussoGeorgian
conflict
http://www.bild.de/BrLD/news/bild-english/world-news/2008/08/14/condoleezza-rice/givesrassia-ominous-warning-over-georgia.html##;
also a 2009 statement by several Republicans linking the NMD to the
history of Russo-Polish relations (in Russian)
http://echo.msk.ru/news/620886-echo.phtml\'). 5 [Master\'s Thesis Anton
Agafonov triggered by the nationalistic elites in the FSU was [clearly
linked to the need of statehood legitimization]{.mark} and national
identity construction by dismantling common identity with
Russia]{.underline} [and (re-)producing a \"civilizational divide\"
portraying themselves as \"front line\" defenders of civilized and
democratic Europe]{.mark} (West) facing the aggressive non-democratic
and uncivilized Outside. [The logic of citing historical narratives of
\"othering\" in foreign policy-making is extremely dubious and almost
always counter-productive]{.underline} in international relations. It
exemplifies the very dynamics of how discourses of \"othering\" based on
narrated historical resentments and memories tangibly shape
international politics [by sustaining \"othering\" and making inclusion
or improvement of bilateral relations unacceptable]{.mark}. [In these
narratives, prior historical events are often used to predict and
project future behaviour of an actor along the primordial \"they have
always been like this, and will always be\" paradigm.]{.underline}
Applying this logic, practically all historically [significant nations
that can be accused of various crimes under the international
law]{.underline}, including multiple acts of genocide, [pose existential
threat to one another. Reference to [historical path dependencies
advances the idea of primordial propensity of the Other to a certain
type of international behaviour]{.mark}]{.underline}[, which comes close
to racist agendas]{.mark} (see Campbell 1998a citing Butler on
\"defiling\" the Otherness below[). Therefore, it is possible to suggest
that references to histories in the process of discursive construction
of the]{.underline} Other promotes largely an essentialist \"othering\"
treating Other\'s [historical record as an indicator of its inherent
primordial features that remain fixed and unchanged. The discourse
samples selected for this paper may suggest that the]{.underline}
explicit broadcasting of historical resentment narratives representing
an essentialist construction of the Other is much less likely to occur
in the discourse of international organizations where various national 6
Master\'s [Thesis Anton Agafonov positions are blended and smoothed to
produce a diplomatically more neutral narrative, than in the discourse
of national governments and epistemic communities.]{.underline} At the
level of the general public, being the key target audience for an
official discourse, where [speakers]{.mark} [do not bear responsibility
of governance]{.mark}, face little personal risks, and have far fewer
incentives for self-restraint in their narratives[, the essentialist
view of the Other, often]{.mark} combined with [chauvinistic nationalism
and aggressive racism, is much likelier to be manifested in a discourse
of \"othering.\" Thus it is possible to suggest the presence of a
\"continuum\" of a top-down increase, from the international level down
to individual level, in the presence of essentialist views of the Other
and the discursive \"othering]{.underline}\" drawing on primordial
attributes. Apparently, this phenomenon of assigning essentialist
features to the [Other perceived as a threat and denying it features
shared by the Self a rooted in human psychology that urges for clear,
stable and incontestable delineations between the Self and Other, in a
somewhat similar way like states strive to attain clear, fixed and
incontestable borders separating them from other states]{.underline}

#### Framing Russia as a threat fuels a global drive to eliminate danger 

**Jaeger 2k** \[Norwegian Institute of International Affairs\] Jæger,
Øyvind. "Securitizing Russia: Discursive Practices of the Baltic
States." (2000) // Accessed 7/12/19

The Russian war on Chechnya is one event that was widely interpreted in
the Baltic as a ominous sign of what Russia has in store for the Baltic
states (see Rebas 1996: 27; Nekrasas 1996: 58; Tarand 1996: 24; cf. Haab
1997). [The constitutional ban in all three states on any kind of
association with post-Soviet political structures is indicative of a
threat perception that confuses Soviet and post-Soviet[, conflating
Russia with the USSR and casting everything Russian as a threat]{.mark}
through what Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe (1985) call a discursive
\"chain of equivalence\". In this the value of one side in a binary
opposition is reiterated in other denotations of the same binary
opposition. Thus, [the value \"Russia\" in a Russia/Europe-opposition is
also denoted by \"instability\", \"Asia\", \"invasion\", \"chaos\",
\"incitement of ethnic minorities\", \"unpredictability\",
\"imperialism\", \"slander campaign\", \"migration\", and so
forth]{.mark}.]{.underline} The opposite value of these markers
(\"stability\", \"Europe\", \"defence\", \"order\", and so on) would
then denote the Self and thus conjure up an identity. [[When identity is
precarious]{.mark}, this [discursive practice intensifies]{.mark} by
shifting onto [a security mode]{.mark}, [treating]{.mark} the
oppositions as if they were [questions]{.mark} [of political existence,
sovereignty, and survival]{.mark}. Identity is (re)produced more
effectively when the oppositions are employed in a discourse of
insecurity and danger, that is, made into questions of national security
and thus securitised in the W�verian sense]{.underline}. In the Baltic
cases, especially the Lithuanian National Security Concept is knitting a
chain of equivalence in a ferocious discourse of danger. Not [only does
it establish \"\[t\]hat the defence of Lithuania is total and
unconditional,\" and that \"\[s\]hould there be no higher command,
self-controlled combat actions of armed units and citizens shall be
considered legal.\" (National Security Concept, Lithuania, Ch. 7, Sc. 1,
2) It also posits that \[t\]he power of civic resistance is constituted
of the Nation's Will and self-determination to fight for own freedom, of
everyone citizen�s resolution to resist to \[an\] assailant or invader
by all possible ways, despite citizens age and \[or\] profession, of
taking part in Lithuania's defense (National Security Concept,
Lithuania, Ch. 7, Sc. 4).]{.underline} When this is added to the
identifying of the objects of national security as \"human and citizen
rights, fundamental freedoms and personal security; state sovereignty;
rights of the nation, prerequisites for a free development; the state
independence; the constitutional order; state territory and its
integrity, and; cultural heritage,\" and the subjects as \"the state,
the armed forces and other institutions thereof; the citizens and their
associations, and; non governmental organisations,\"(National Security
Concept, Lithuania, Ch. 2, Sc. 1, 2) one approaches a conception of
security in which the distinction between state and nation has
disappeared in all-encompassing securitisation. [[Everyone is expected
to defend everything with every possible means]{.mark}. And when the
list of [identified threats]{.mark} to national security that follows
range from \"overt (military) aggression\", via \"personal insecurity\",
to \"ignoring of national values,\"(National Security Concept,
Lithuania, Ch. 10) the National Security Concept of Lithuania has
[become a totalising one taking everything to be a question of national
security]{.mark}. The chain of equivalence is established when the very
introduction of the National Security Concept is devoted to a denotation
of Lithuania�s century-old sameness to \"Europe\" and resistance to
\"occupation and subjugation\"]{.underline} (see quotation below),
whereby Russia is depicted and installed as the first link in the
discursive chain that follows. In much the same way the \"enemy within\"
came about in Estonia and Latvia. [As the independence-memory was
ritualised and added to the sense of insecurity � already fed by
confusion in state administration, legislation and government policy
grappling not only with what to do but also how to do it given the
inexperience of state institutions or their absence � unity behind the
overarching objective of independence receded for partial politics and
the construction of the enemy within]{.underline}. This is what David
Campbell (1992) points out when he sees the practices of security as
being about securing a precarious state identity. One way of going about
it is to cast elements on the state inside resisting the privileged
identity as the subversive errand boys of the prime external enemy. [An
example of exclusionary practices]{.underline} of this kind is found in
the Latvian National Security Concept (p. 2) in which it is stated
explicitly that \[s\]ince the external threat of \[to\] Latvia can be
related to efforts of neighbouring countries to destabilise internal
situation in Latvia, it is impossible to shift external threat from
internal one clearly. And the Lithuanian National Security Concept (Ch.
1, Sc. 1) cites under a rubric labelled \"Specific\", [\"incitement of
ethnic groups to disloyal behaviour or disintegration\" as
\"\[p\]otential risks and foreign threats to Lithuania�s
security\".]{.underline} The document Guidelines of the National Defence
Policy of Estonia busies itself strictly with military threats, but Mare
Haab (1997), an Estonian International Relations (IR) scholar involved
in counselling on the drafting of a National Security Concept, notes
that \"\[f\]earing a \"fifth column\" is a distinct part of Estonia�s
threat perception\". And indeed, a recent proposal by the Estonian
Defence Ministry to draft residents-yet-not-citizens for alternative,
non-military national service provoked an outcry in the Estonian
Parliament casting the proposal as tantamount to creating a \"fifth
column\" within Estonian Armed Forces (Clemmesen 1997). In neither
Estonia nor Latvia are Russian speakers (or others) in citizenship limbo
allowed to serve even in the volunteer Home Guards (Clemmesen 1997).

 🐸

[[Russian missiles struck airports, military positions and cities across
Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}, including the capital of Kyiv, early
Thursday as Vladimir Putin launched the most dangerous phase of his
eight-year war. Witnesses and reporters heard blasts from Kharkiv in the
east to Kyiv in the north to Odessa in the south, signaling Russian's
sights are set far beyond the Donbas region. In a statement, Ukrainian
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said his nation suffered "[[strikes on
military and other important defense]{.mark} facilitie]{.underline}s,"
adding that "border units are under attack, the situation in the Donbas
has degraded." "This is an unjustified, deceitful and cynical invasion,"
he said. Separately, Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov added
that the "enemy began intense shelling of our units in the east, as well
as military control centers and airfields in other regions." CNN quoted
a Ukrainian government official who said the attack has already led to
hundreds of casualties, a figure POLITICO could not immediately verify.
Zelenskyy spoke with Biden early Thursday morning local time. In
a [statement about the
call](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/02/24/statement-by-president-joe-biden-on-phone-call-with-president-volodymyr-zelenskyy-of-ukraine/),
Biden said "the United States and our Allies and partners will be
imposing severe sanctions on Russia." **[[The strikes on Ukraine
followed Putin's announcement of a "special military operation" against
Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}**, during which he falsely claimed that two
Moscow-backed breakaway regions inside Ukraine were under attack by
Kyiv's forces**[. [Putin declared: "I have declared a special military
operation" for the "demilitarization and de-Nazification of
Ukraine]{.mark}.]{.underline}**""This is the red line that I have spoken
of many times," he continued, apparently [wearing the same red tie and
speaking from the same
office](https://twitter.com/DAlperovitch/status/1496678956879204358?s=20&t=euSgl4X5ijQdnNKV7x2xoQ) from
which he gave an address on Monday. "They have crossed it." Putin vowed
not to occupy the country[, [but demanded that Ukrainian forces lay down
their arms or bear responsibility for
"bloodshed]{.underline}]{.mark}."And in a clear message to the United
States and its allies, Putin warned foreign powers not to interfere in
his operation: "If you do, you will face consequences greater than any
you have faced in history. All relevant decisions have been taken. I
hope you hear me."His pronouncement at 5:45 a.m. Moscow time --- during
a simultaneous U.N. Security Council meeting in New York, at which
Western nations pleaded for Putin to exercise restraint and de-escalate
--- could spark the largest land war in Europe since World War II, one
that could result in the deaths of thousands of Ukrainian and Russian
troops and civilians, and spark a refugee crisis.Putin rebuked months of
Western diplomatic entreaties to end the crisis sparked by the amassing
of Moscow's nearly 200,000 troops on Ukraine's border. Instead of
shaking American and European hands, the Russian president slapped them
away, pointing his forces toward the Ukrainian lands he has directed
them to seize.Zelenskyy made an impassioned speech in the early hours of
Thursday morning local time, rallying his country in the national tongue
before switching to Russian in an appeal not to the Kremlin, but to
Russian citizens. "Lots of you have relatives in Ukraine, you studied in
Ukrainian universities, you have Ukrainian friends," he said. "You know
our character, our principles, what matters to us. Listen to yourselves,
to the voice of reason. The people of Ukraine want peace."Shortly
thereafter, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Gen. Mark Milley,
the Joint Chiefs chair, told different outlets the Russian assault could
begin before the sun rose in Kyiv on Thursday. They were right. "The
prayers of the entire world are with the people of Ukraine tonight as
they suffer an unprovoked and unjustified attack by Russian military
forces," President Joe Biden said in a statement released by the White
House. "President Putin has chosen a premeditated war that will bring a
catastrophic loss of life and human suffering. Russia alone is
responsible for the death and destruction this attack will bring, and
the United States and its Allies and partners will respond in a united
and decisive way. The world will hold Russia accountable."

### Scenario Planning

#### The era of digital technology allows for the overabundance of instant, images of war that fuel constant speculation in search of meaning. Global, immeasurable, implosive violence is done to the violated when one tries to make sense of the senseless. 

**Artrip and Debrix 14** (François, Director of the Alliance for Social,
Political, Ethical, and Cultural Thought (ASPECT) and Professor of
Political Science at Virginia Tech, Ryan E., doctoral candidate in the
Alliance for Social, Political, Ethical, and Cultural Thought (ASPECT)
at Virginia Tech, "*The Digital Fog of War: Baudrillard and the Violence
of Representation*," Volume 11, Number 2 (May, 2014), SPECIAL ISSUE:
BAUDRILLARD AND WAR, 6/21/22 - FI)

[Behind]{.underline} the widespread "global[" [celebration of
digitalized technologies]{.mark}]{.underline} for their newly found
representational capabilities and accuracies, there [[lies the idea
that]{.mark},]{.underline} [perhaps]{.underline} following a collective
disgust with the dealings of Western media outlets as more or less
uncritical props for the social/economic/ethical status quo in the past
several decades, disseminated and "democratized" media technologies can
de-mystify the world, lift its aura in a way, [or [perhaps "**dig
deeper" into**]{.mark} **[the "truth]{.mark}"** than, say]{.underline},
what the media networks involved in reporting news (including war news)
in the 1980s and 1990's (the famous CNN effect) ever could do. Because
[these technologies are [far **more in real-time** than news]{.mark}
networks,]{.underline} they are also generally thought to be a[ble to
evade]{.underline} oppressive/repressive [censorship of]{.underline}
particular [corporate/class/state/ideology interests.]{.underline} But
even more than escaping filters[, digital representations today are
often thought to be able to eliminate all of the ambiguities born of
time.]{.underline} Thus, [[we]{.underline}]{.mark} (members of the
public/demos) [[**want to believe that mediation can be
removed**.]{.underline}]{.mark} And we want to subscribe to the view
that any **[[distortion]{.underline}]{.mark}** occurring between an
event and its perception/memory, or [[between the "actual" and its
account]{.mark}, can **[evaporate]{.mark}**.]{.underline} By reducing to
the virtually infinitesimal or invisible the filter/screen between the
image that represents and the real that is and, furthermore, by placing
the productive responsibilities for the image into the hands of the user
(literally into the digits), [the digital establishes itself as
[something capable of demolishing the]{.mark} "malicious" surf[ace of
appearances to **reveal a meaningful**]{.mark} density of
**[truth]{.mark}**]{.underline} through the quasi-immediate interface.
This is the dream of immediacy rediscovered and perhaps finally
realized. At a most basic level of analysis, the [**risk**
involved]{.underline} in pointing to this desire for mediatized or
digitalized immediacy [would be to **undermine the visual evidence of**
the violent/virulent occurrence of the omnipresence of
**war**.]{.underline} For example, could we have deployed a critique of
the US military's and the US government's use of torture in the War on
Terror were it not for the seemingly unfiltered "shock and awe" of the
Abu Ghraib photos? Again, from the point of view of the ethos of
virtual/virulent war, the lure of digitalized immediacy has its uses
(and, possibly, benefits, too, even for the demos). But, from the
perspective of war's mythos, it must be said that the "truth" about war
and war operations cannot be fully revealed because representation, no
matter how immediate or seemingly unmediated, always works by imposing
some meaning onto things/events that are made visible/representable.
[[Consider the role played by digital media in the Boston Marathon
bombing]{.underline}]{.mark} in April 2013.
[[Within]{.underline}]{.mark} a matter of [[minutes]{.underline}]{.mark}
of the blasts, even before the smoke could clear the scene, [[images and
videos]{.mark} of terror taken from spectators' mobile devices
[circulated]{.mark} through cyberspace]{.underline}. Everything was
seemingly **[[captured in that instan]{.underline}]{.mark}t**. [[The
**horror**]{.underline}]{.mark} that drew so many people to capture
images through their smart phones seems to [**[speak on its
own]{.mark}**; it [needs no commentary]{.mark}, [**no meaning to be
given** to it]{.mark}. In fact, it appears to have no mediation, no
appropriation or narrativizing, no contextualizing either]{.underline}.
That is [precisely why smart phones are so apt at giving us such
image]{.underline}s, such representations, such "[**pure" meanings about
things**. Especially, such a horrifying violence]{.underline}, it is
said, needs no commentary, no sense to be made of it. An
**[[immeasurable violence is done to the violated when one tries to make
sense of the senseless]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Agamben, 1999). Yet, as
Baudrillard had already pointed out in his remarks on the Gulf War,
"[[everything]{.mark} which is [turned into information]{.mark} [becomes
the object of endless speculation]{.mark}, the site of total
uncertainty]{.underline}. We are [left with the symptomatic reading on
our screens of the effects of the war, or the effects of discourse about
the war, or completely speculative strategic evaluation]{.underline}s"
(Baudrillard, 1995: 41). In their digital representation, [**[images of
war and images of terror]{.mark}** are [dissolved into their own
**information**.]{.mark}]{.underline} Information (what the image/event
wants to tell us, to reveal, allegedly) already infiltrates the tweeted
or texted image/scene (of horror, of war) with an urgency of
signification and meaning. Images of horror cannot make sense, perhaps
must not be made sense of, and yet they somehow beg for meaning[, for
circulation, or for propagation, in the hope that they may reveal
something to someone.]{.underline} Thus, the digitalized mediation of
the image, even in its instantaneity, still takes place. Images---or
whatever event might have been "caught"---must succumb to a will to
information, to a will to meaning, even if it is falsely affirmed that
what is digitally rendered needs no commentary. Put differently, [the
[**image levels the event** it represents by entering into a
mass]{.mark}/global indifferent **[exchange]{.mark}**, into a virulent
global (representational) circulation that murders singularity or,
indeed, the moment of trauma]{.underline} (on this question of the
erasure of trauma, see Debrix, 2008: 4-5; Edkins, 2003: 37-38). The
[**[enigmatic singularity of the event]{.mark}**---which, for
Baudrillard, was once a precondition for any sort of historical
transition---[**gives way to an endlessness of representation**,]{.mark}
whether such representation appears to have a clear ethical or political
purpose/signification or not.]{.underline} [It is in this]{.underline}
always operative [tendency]{.underline} of rendered appearances [to
yield meaning]{.underline} (even if their meaning is to be
information-worthy), not in the image or event itself, [that we situate
the conditions of possibility and reproducibility for the
ever-thickening representational fog and for the violence/virulence of
images]{.underline}, or better yet, of appearances. [[To **make
war**]{.mark} or]{.underline}, as the case may be, the
[terror]{.underline} event **[[mean
something]{.underline}]{.mark}**---even in some of the most immediate
reactions often designed to evoke injustice or, indeed,
incomprehension---**[[is the generative point of
violence]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the source of representation as a
virulent/virtual code and mode of signification. Baudrillard writes,
"Everywhere one seeks to produce meaning, to make the world signify, to
render it visible." He adds, "[[We are]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[not]{.underline}]{.mark}**, however, **[[in danger of lacking
meaning]{.underline}]{.mark}**; \[...\] [[**we are gorged with meaning
and it is killing us**"]{.underline}]{.mark} (Baudrillard, 1988: 63).
Indeed, the Western world---increasingly, the global---has found itself
with a proliferation of meanings and significations in the late 20th and
early 21st centuries. It is as if the so-called crisis of nihilism
(thought to be characteristic of much critique and philosophical
suspicion throughout the 20th century) later on produced something of
the opposite order. The mass violence of the 20th century inaugurated
not a complete void of despair or meaninglessness, but instead a flood
of meaning, if not an overproduction of it. [[Baudrillard refers to
this]{.mark} frantic [explosion of meaning]{.mark}/signification [as "a
panic-stricken production of the real and the
referential]{.mark}]{.underline}, above and parallel to the panic of
material production \[...\]" (Baudrillard, 1983: 7). Here, Baudrillard
describes a [[mode of production]{.underline}]{.mark} of a different
kind, not [[motivated b]{.mark}y]{.underline} class interests or
exploitation of value, but by [[an automated]{.mark}, perhaps viral,
a[breaction to the]{.mark} empty core or [disenchantment of
things]{.mark} and the world]{.underline}: that is to say, the degree to
which [[things seem to lack a singular center]{.mark} of
gravity]{.underline} or have lost a justifiable reference to the real
world, and [[yet **each thing that "matters"** is also an **attempt to
get at reality as a question of**]{.mark} accumulation (of
**[meaning]{.mark}**), circulation (of signs]{.underline}), and filling
up of all interstitial spaces of communication and value. The [**[end
result is an over-abundance of signs]{.mark}** and images of
reality,]{.underline} something that **[[culminates
in]{.underline}]{.mark}** what Baudrillard calls
**[[hyperreality]{.underline}]{.mark}**---[things appear more real than
reality itself.]{.underline} The story that needs to be told is thus not
about the undoubtedly deplorable "truth" or fact of explosive and
warlike violence, but about a [violence of another sort]{.underline}. In
the radical digital transparency of the global scene, we (members of the
demos) often have full or direct exposure to explosivity, as we saw
above with the image of terror. But [[what still needs to be]{.mark}
thought and [problematized is]{.mark}]{.underline} implosivity or what
may be called **[[implosive violence]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Implosive
violence is [a [violence for **which we do not**]{.mark}, and perhaps
will never, **[have]{.mark} much of [a language]{.mark}**]{.underline}
(Rancière, 2007: 123). Although, not having a language for it or,
rather, as we saw above, seeking to find a language to talk about it
and, perhaps, [[to make sense of it is still sought
after]{.underline}]{.mark}. This is, perhaps, what digital pictures of
war/terror violence seek to capture or want to force through. Implosive
violence, [often digitally rendered these days, is in close contact with
media technologies and representational device]{.underline}s and
techniques [[because it **seeks** ]{.mark}**representation and
[meaning]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[This is **why implosive violence
insists on calling in wars**]{.underline}]{.mark} (against terror, for
example) [and]{.underline} on **[mobilizing war machines]{.underline}**
(against terrorist others, against vague enemy figures), [**[but wars
and war machines]{.mark}** that **[no]{.mark} [longer
have]{.mark}**]{.underline}---to the extent that they ever had---[**[a
clearly]{.mark} identifiable** object and subject, or a clear
**mission/[purpose]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[As
such]{.mark},]{.underline} this [[implosive violence and its
wars]{.underline}]{.mark} (the new Western/global way of war, perhaps)
**[must [remain]{.mark}]{.underline}** uncertain, unclear,
**[[foggy]{.underline}]{.mark}**, inwardly driven, representational, and
indeed virulent. They must remain uncertain and confused [even as they
are digitally operative and desperately capture events/images to give
the impression that meanings/significations can and will be
found.]{.underline} Yet, as we saw above, [**it is not meanings exactly
that must be found, but information** and the endless guarantee of its
immediate circulation]{.underline}. [[As **information occupies** the
empty place of **meaning**]{.underline}]{.mark}, certainty, or truth,
**i[[mages must be instantaneously turned into
appearances]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[that]{.mark} [search for
meanings]{.mark} that will never be discovered because]{.underline},
instead[, a proliferation of information-worthy facts and beliefs will
take over]{.underline} (perhaps this is what US fake pundit and comedian
Stephen Colbert famously referred to as "[truthiness]{.underline}"). Or,
as Baudrillard puts it, "free from its former enemies, humanity now has
to create enemies from within, which in fact produces a wide variety of
inhuman metastases" (Baudrillard, 2003). Thus, [[this **implosive
violence is**]{.underline}]{.mark} destined to be a [**[global]{.mark}
violence** sinc[e it \"is the **product of a system that tracks
down**]{.mark}]{.underline} any form of **[[negativity and
singularity]{.underline}]{.mark},** [including]{.underline} of course
[death]{.underline} as the ultimate form of singularity. \[...\]
[[It]{.mark}]{.underline} is [a **violence** **that**,]{.underline} in a
sense, **[[puts an end to violence itself and strives to establish a
world where anything related to the natural must
disappear]{.underline}]{.mark}** \[...\] Better than a global violence,
[we should call it a global virulence]{.underline}. This form of
violence is indeed viral. It [moves by contagion,]{.underline} [produces
by chain reaction]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} little by little it
[destroys our]{.underline} immune systems and our [capacities to
resist]{.underline}\" (2003; our italics).

### Security

#### Championing security above all else expresses a fear of [nature]{.underline} as anarchic and unpredictable, culminating in a [nationalist politics]{.underline} motivated by a [hatred of all that is different or unknown]{.underline}, in [endless crises, preemptive wars, and total fear]{.underline}. We ask a prior question: [why value security at all?]{.underline} Only by finding joy in the unpredictable, the unknown, and the different can we resist the global homogeneity that makes life unbearable. 

**Der Derian 8** (James, "The Value of Security: Hobbes, Marx,
Nietzsche, and Baudrillard," in Critical Practices in International
Theory: Selected Essays, Taylor and Francis, 149-59)

**[The rapidity of change]{.underline}** in the international system,
**[as well as the inability of international theory to make sense of
that change, raises this question: Of what value is
security?]{.underline}** More specifically, just how secure is this
preeminent concept of international relations? **[This evaluation of
security invokes interpretive strategies to ask epistemological,
ontological, and political questions -- questions that all too often are
ignored, subordinated, or displaced by the technically biased, narrowly
framed question of *what* it takes to achieve security.]{.underline}**
The goal, then, of this inquiry is to make philosophically problematic
that which has been practically axiomatic in international relations.
The first step is to ask whether **[the paramount value of security lies
in its abnegation of the insecurity of all values. No other concept in
international relations packs the metaphysical punch, nor commands the
disciplinary power of "security." In its name, peoples have alienated
their fears, rights and powers to gods, emperors, and most recently,
sovereign states, all to protect themselves from the vicissitudes of
nature]{.underline}** -- as well as from other gods, emperors, and
sovereign states**[. In its name, weapons of mass destruction have been
developed which have transfigured national interest into a security
dilemma based on a suicide pact.]{.underline}** And, less often noted in
international relations, **[in its name billions have been made and
millions killed while scientific knowledge has been furthered and
intellectual dissent muted. We have inherited an *ontotheology* of
security]{.underline}**, that is, **[an *a priori* argument that proves
the existence and necessity of only one form of security because there
currently happens to be a widespread, metaphysical belief in it. Indeed,
within the concept of security lurks the entire history of western
metaphysics]{.underline}**, which was best described by Derrida "as a
series of substitutions of center for center" in a perpetual search for
the "transcendental signified."1 From God to Rational Man, from Empire
to Republic, from King to the People -- and on occasion in the reverse
direction as well, for history is never so linear, never so neat as we
would write it **[-- the security of the center has been the shifting
site from which the forces of authority, order, and identity
philosophically defined and physically kept at bay anarchy, chaos, and
difference. Yet the center]{.underline}**, as modern poets and
postmodern critics tell us, **[no longer holds]{.underline}**. The
demise of a bipolar system, **[the diffusion of power into new
political, national, and economic constellations, the decline of civil
society and the rise of the shopping mall, the acceleration of
*everything*]{.underline}** -- transportation, capital and information
flows, change itself--[have induced a new anxiety]{.underline}. As
George Bush repeatedly said -- that is, until the 1992 Presidential
election went into full swing -- "**[The enemy is unpredictability. The
enemy is instability."]{.underline}**2 **[One immediate response, the
unthinking reaction, is to master this anxiety and to resecure the
center by remapping the peripheral threats. In this vein, the Pentagon
prepares seven military scenarios for future conflict,]{.underline}**
ranging from *latino* small-fry to an IdentiKit super-enemy that goes by
the generic acronym of REGT ("Reemergent Global Threat"). In the
heartlands of America, Toyota sledge-hammering returns as a popular
know-nothing distraction. And **[within the Washington beltway, rogue
powers such as North Korea, Iraq, and Libya take on the status of
pariah-state and potential video bomb-site for a permanently
electioneering elite]{.underline}**. There are also prodromal efforts to
shore up the center of the International Relations discipline. In a
newly instituted series in the *International Studies Quarterly*, the
state of security studies is surveyed so as to refortify its borders.3
After acknowledging that "the boundaries of intellectual disciplines are
permeable," the author proceeds not only to raise the drawbridge but
also to caulk every chink in the moat.4 Recent attempts to broaden the
concept of "security" to include such issues as global environmental
dangers, disease, and economic and natural disasters endanger the field
by threatening "to destroy its intellectual coherence and make it more
difficult to devise solutions to any of these important problems."5 The
field is surveyed in the most narrow and parochial way: out of 200-plus
works cited, esteemed Third World scholars of strategic studies receive
no mention, British and French scholars receive short shrift, and Soviet
writers do not make it into the Pantheon at all. The author of the
essay, Stephen Walt, has written one of the better books on alliance
systems;6 here he seems intent on constructing a new alliance within the
discipline against "foreign" others, with the "postmodernist" as
arch-alien. The tactic is familiar: like many of the neoconservatives
who have launched the recent attacks on "political correctness," the
"liberals" of international relations make it a habit to base their
criticisms on secondary accounts of a category of thinking rather than
on a primary engagement with the specific (and often differing) views of
the thinkers themselves.7 In this case, Walt cites IR scholar Robert
Keohane on the hazards of "reflectivism," to warn off anyone who by
inclination or error might wander into the foreign camp: "As Robert
Keohane has noted, until these writers 'have delineated \... a research
program and shown \... that it can illuminate important issues in world
politics, they will remain on the margins of the field.' "8 By the end
of the essay, one is left with the suspicion that **[the rapid changes
in world politics have triggered a "security crisis" in security studies
that requires extensive theoretical damage control. What if we leave the
desire for mastery to the insecure and instead imagine a new dialogue of
security, not in the pursuit of a utopian end but in recognition of the
world as it is, other than us?]{.underline}** What might such a dialogue
sound like? **[Any attempt at an answer requires a genealogy: to
understand the discursive power of the concept, to remember its
forgotten meanings, to assess its economy of use in the present, to
reinterpret -- and possibly construct through the reinterpretation -- a
late modern security comfortable with a plurality of centers, multiple
meanings, and fluid identities.]{.underline}** The steps I take here in
this direction are tentative and preliminary. I first undertake a brief
history of the concept itself. Second, I present the "originary" form of
security that has so dominated our conception of international
relations, the Hobbesian episteme of realism. Third, I consider the
impact of two major challenges to the Hobbesian episteme, that of Marx
and Nietzsche. And finally, I suggest that Baudrillard provides the
best, if most nullifying, analysis of security in late modernity. In
short, I retell the story of realism as an historic encounter of fear
and danger with power and order that produced four realist forms of
security: epistemic, social, interpretive, and hyperreal. To preempt a
predictable criticism, I wish to make it clear that I am not in search
of an "alternative security." An easy defense is to invoke Heidegger,
who declared that "questioning is the piety of thought."9 Foucault,
however, gives the more powerful reason for a genealogy of security: I
am not looking for an alternative; you can't find the solution of a
problem in the solution of another problem raised at another moment by
other people. You see, what I want to do is not the history of
solutions, and that's the reason why I don't accept the word
*alternative*. My point is not that everything is bad, but that
everything is dangerous, then we always have something to do.10 The hope
is that in the interpretation of the most pressing dangers of late
modernity we might be able to construct a form of security based on the
appreciation and articulation rather than the normalization or
extirpation of difference. **A genealogy of the concept [In traditional
realist representations of world politics as the struggle for power
among states, the will to security is born out of a primal fear, a
natural estrangement and a condition of anarchy which diplomacy,
international law and the balance of power seek, yet ultimately fail, to
mediate]{.underline}**.11 By considering some historical meanings of
security that exceed this prevailing view, I wish to suggest "new"
possibilities and intelligibilities for security. Admittedly, this brief
genealogy is thin on analysis and thick on description. But my intention
is to provoke discussion, and to suggest that there is more than a
speculative basis for the acceptance of a concept of security that is
less coherent and dogmatic, and more open to the historical complexity
and contingent nature of international relations. In its earlier use,
"security" traveled down a double-track and, then, somewhere at the turn
of the nineteenth century, one track went underground. **[Conventionally
understood, security refers to a condition of being protected, free from
danger, safety.]{.underline}** This meaning prevailed in the great power
diplomacy of the modern states- system. In 1704, the *Act of Security*
was passed by the Scottish Parliament, which forbade the ascension of
Queen Anne's successor to the throne of Scotland unless the independence
of the Scottish kingdom was "secured."12 In 1781, Gibbon conveyed a
specifically geopolitical meaning when he wrote in *The Decline and Fall
of the Roman Empire* that "the emperor and his court enjoyed \... the
security of the marshes and fortifications of Ravenna."13 **[Coeval,
however, with the evolution of security as a preferred condition of
safety was a different connotation, of security as a condition of false
or misplaced confidence in one's position.]{.underline}** In *Macbeth*,
Shakespeare wrote that "Security is Mortals cheefest Enemie."14 In a
1774 letter, Edmund Burke impugned "The supineness, neglect, and blind
security of my friend, in that, and every thing that concerns him."15
And, as late as 1858, the *Saturday Review* reported that "Every
government knew exactly when there was reason for alarm, and when there
was excuse for security."16 Clearly, the unproblematical essence that is
often attached to the term today does not stand up to even a cursory
investigation. **[From its origins, security has had contested meanings,
indeed, even contradictory ones]{.underline}**. Certainly, the tension
of definition is inherent in the elusiveness of the phenomenon it seeks
to describe, as well as in the efforts of various users to fix and
attach meanings for their own ends. Yet there is something else
operating at the discursive level: I believe there is a talismanic
*sign* to security that seeks to provide what the *property* of security
cannot. The clue is in the numerous citations from sermons found in the
*Oxford English Dictionary*. They all use **[security]{.underline}** to
convey the second sense, that **[is, a careless, hubristic, even
damnable overconfidence]{.underline}**. The excerpts range in dates from
the sixteenth to the nineteenth century: "They \... were drowned in
sinneful security" (1575); "This is a Reflection which \... should
strike Terror and Amazement into the securest Sinner" (1729); one,
claiming that "It is an imaginary immortality which encloses him in
sevenfold security, even while he stands upon its very last edge"
(1876).17 Mediating between these two senses of security lies a third.
In the face of a danger, a debt, or an obligation of some kind, one
seeks a security, in the form of a pledge, a bond, a surety. From the
1828 *Webster*: "Violent and dangerous men are obliged to give security
for their good behavior, or for keeping the peace."18 In Markby's
*Elementary Law* (1874), the word is given a precise financial meaning:
"I shall also use the word security to express any transaction between
the debtor and creditor by which the performance of such a service (one
capable of being represented in money) is secured."19 A security could
also be "represented" in person. Shakespeare again, from *Henry IV* :
"He said, sir, you should procure him better Assurance, the Bardole: he
wold not take his Bond and yours, he lik'd not the Security."20 **Hobbes
and epistemic realism** Nor is it enough for the security, which men
desire should last all the time of their life, that they be governed,
and directed by one judgement, for a limited time; as in one Battle, or
one War. For though they obtain a Victory by their unanimous endeavour
against a foreign enemy; yet afterwards when either they have no common
enemy, or he that by one part is held for an enemy, is by another part
held for a friend, they must needs by the difference of their interests
dissolve, and fall again into a War amongst themselves. --Thomas Hobbes,
*Leviathan* **[For]{.underline}** his representation of security**[,
Hobbes]{.underline}** preferred the axiomatic style of Euclid and the
historical reasoning of Thucydides to the poetic excess of Shakespeare.
Both Hobbes and Shakespeare contributed interpretations that exceeded
and out- lived their contemporary political contexts and historical
emulations.21 However (and unfortunately), since Hobbes rather than
Shakespeare enjoys a paradigmatic status in international relations, a
short overview of his foundational ideas on realism and security is
needed. In chapter 10 of the *Leviathan*, Hobbes opens with the
proposition that "The Power of a Man \... is his present means, to
obtain some future apparent Good."22 Harmless enough, it would seem,
until this power is put into relation with other men seeking future
goods. Conflict inevitably follows, "because the power of one man
resisteth and hindereth the effects of the power of another: power
simply is no more, but the excess of the power of one above that of
another."23 A man's power comes to rest on his *eminence*, the margin of
power that he is able to exercise over others. The classic formulation
follows in chapter 11: "So that in the first place, I put a general
inclination of all mankind, a perpetual and restless desire of power
after power, that ceaseth onely in Death."24 The implications for
interpersonal and interstate relations are obvious. Without a common
power to constrain this perpetual struggle there can be no common law:
"And Convenants, without the Sword, are but Words, and of no strength to
secure a man at all."25 In the state of nature there exists a
fundamental imbalance between man's needs and his capacity to satisfy
them -- with the most basic need being security from a violent and
sudden death. To avoid injury from one another and from foreign
invasion, men "confer all their power and strength upon one Man, or upon
one Assembly of men, that man reduce all their Wills, by plurality of
voices, into one Will."26 The constitution of the Leviathan, the
sovereign state, provides for a domestic peace, but at a price. Hobbes's
solution for civil war displaces the disposition for a "warre of every
man against every man" to the international arena.27 Out of fear, for
gain, or in the pursuit of glory, states will go to war because they
can. Like men in the precontractual state of nature, they seek the
margin of power that will secure their right of self-preservation -- and
run up against states acting out of similar needs and desires. In these
passages **[we can discern]{.underline}** **[the ontotheological
foundations of an epistemic realism, in the sense of an ethico-political
imperative embedded in the nature of things]{.underline}**.28 **[The
sovereign state and territoriality become the necessary effects of
anarchy, contingency, disorder that are assumed to exist *independent*
of and *prior* to any rational or linguistic conception of them. In
epistemic realism, the search for security through sovereignty is not a
political choice but the necessary reaction to an anarchical
condition]{.underline}**: Order is man-made and good; chaos is natural
and evil. Out of self-interest, men must pursue this good and constrain
the evil of excessive will through an alienation of individual powers to
a superior, indeed supreme, collective power. In short, **[the security
of epistemic realism is ontological, theological and
teleological]{.underline}**: that is, metaphysical. We shall see, from
Marx's and Nietzsche's critiques, the extent to which **[Hobbesian
security and epistemic realism rely on social constructions posing as
apodictic truths for their power effects. There is not and never was a
"state of nature" or a purely "self-interested man"; there is, however,
clearly an abiding fear of violent and premature death that compels men
to seek the security found in solidarity. The irony, perhaps even
tragedy, is that by constituting the first science of security, Hobbes
made a singular contribution to the eventual subversion of the
metaphysical foundations of solidarity.]{.underline} Marx and social
realism** Of course, the measure of the power that I gain for my object
over yours needs your recognition in order to become a real power. But
our mutual recognition of the mutual power of our objects is a battle in
which he conquers who has the more energy, strength, insight and
dexterity. If I have enough physical strength I plunder you directly. If
the kingdom of physical strength no longer holds sway then we seek to
deceive each other, the more dextrous beats the less. --Karl Marx, Notes
on James Mill's *Elements of Political Economy* Marx took probably the
most devastating -- and certainly the most politically influential --
shot at the metaphysics of Hobbesian security. I will avoid the obvious
gesture of recounting how Marx put Hegel -- and with him the state --
back on material footing, and instead focus on Marx's early polemic
against the universalist guise of the state, "On the Jewish Question."29
In the essay, Marx traces the split between civil society and the state
to the spread of secularized traditions of Judaism and Christianity. In
an essentialist if not racialist manner, Marx locates the earliest
"spirit of capitalism" in the Judaic practices of usury and the
"chimerical nationality of the Jew \... of the trader and above all the
financier."30 He attributes to it a powerfully corrosive effect that
sunders Christianity's universalist spirit into the "spirit of *civil
society*, of the sphere of egoism, of the *bellum omnium contra omes*."
The "war of all against all" is not the residue of an imagined state of
nature, but the universalization of the "capitalist spirit" of Judaism
"under the reign of Christianity," which "dissolves the human world into
a world of atomistic, mutually hostile individuals." Like Hobbes, Marx
is a realist in that he acknowledges a universal struggle for power; and
he is clearly indebted to Hobbes for his nominalist demythologization of
power. But Marx goes one step further, identifying the source of the
Leviathan's power not in a free association of alienated power, but in
"the separation of man from man \... the practical application of the
right of liberty is the right of private property." The desire for
security, then, does not emerge from some external state of nature:
"rather, security is the guarantee of the egoism of civil society." It
is not a Hobbesian fear or self-interest that gives rise to security; it
is money, as "the alienated essence of man's labour and life, this alien
essence dominates him as he worships it." This elevation of the egoistic
partiality to a metaphysical universality conceals the real divisions
created by alienated labor. Not the Leviathan but Mammon binds together
society: "The god of the Jews has been secularized and has become the
god of the world." The state takes on this universalist identity,
becoming the "mediator to which man transfers all his unholiness and all
his *human freedom*." In Marx, alienation gives rise to a struggle for
power which necessitates the security of a state, whereas, in Hobbes,
alienation is a consequence of the struggle for power. Moreover, in Marx
the power struggle is not a permanent condition: it is historically and
class specific, and once the contradiction between a social production
of wealth and the private exercise of power comes to its dialectical
resolution, the state would become obsolescent -- and with it the
security dilemma. For Hobbes, the struggle for power is permanent and
universal; hence the state is unlikely to wither away. Moreover, it is
improbable that a supra-state Leviathan could be constructed: "In states
and commonwealths not dependent on one another, every commonwealth has
an absolute liberty to do what it shall judge most conducive to their
benefits."31 Marx sees this extra-territorial liberty to be as
chimerical as Hobbes's domestic version. Just as the power of partial
economic interests dominates the whole of civil society through the
abstract universality of the state, Marx considered interstate politics
to be the "serf" of a "universal" financial power hiding a narrow class
interest.32 **Nietzsche and interpretive realism** In the last analysis,
"love of the neighbor" is always something secondary, partly
conventional and arbitrary -- illusory in relation to *fear of the
neighbor.* After the structure of society is fixed on the whole and
seems secure against external dangers, it is this fear of the neighbor
that again creates new perspectives of moral valuation. --Friedrich
Nietzsche, *Beyond Good and Evil* **[Nietzsche]{.underline}**
transvalues both Hobbes's and Marx's interpretations of security through
a genealogy of modes of being. His **[method is]{.underline}** not to
uncover some deep meaning or value for security, but **[to destabilize
the intolerable fictional identities of the past which have been created
out of fear, and to affirm the creative differences which might yield
new values for the future.33]{.underline}** Originating in the
paradoxical relationship of a contingent life and a certain death,
**[the history of security reads]{.underline}** for Nietzsche **[as an
abnegation, a resentment]{.underline}** and, finally, a transcendence of
this paradox. In brief, **[the history is one of individuals seeking an
impossible security from the most radical "other" of life, the terror of
death which, once generalized and nationalized, triggers a futile cycle
of collective identities seeking security from alien others--who are
seeking similarly impossible guarantees.]{.underline}** It is a story of
**[differences taking on the otherness of death, and identities
calcifying into a fearful sameness]{.underline}**. Since Nietzsche has
suffered the greatest neglect in international theory, his
reinterpretation of security will receive a more extensive treatment
here. One must begin with Nietzsche's idea of the will to power, which
he clearly believed to be prior to and generative of all considerations
of security. In *Beyond Good and Evil*, he emphatically establishes the
primacy of the will to power: "Physiologists should think before putting
down the instinct of self-preservation as the cardinal instinct of an
organic being. A living thing seeks above all to *discharge* its
strength -- life itself is will to power; self-preservation is only one
of the most frequent results."34 **[The will to power]{.underline}**,
then, **[should not be confused with a Hobbesian perpetual *desire* for
power. It can]{.underline}**, in its negative form, **[produce a
reactive and resentful longing for *only* power, leading, in Nietzsche's
view, to a triumph of nihilism. But Nietzsche refers to a *positive*
will to power, an active and effective force of becoming, from which
values and meanings]{.underline}** -- including self-preservation --
**[are produced which affirm life. Conventions of security act to
suppress rather than con- front the fears endemic to
life,]{.underline}** for "\... life itself is *essentially*
appropriation, injury, overpowering of what is alien and weaker;
suppression, hardness, imposition of one's own forms, incorporation and
at least, at its mildest, exploitation -- but why should one always use
those words in which slanderous intent has been imprinted for ages."35
Elsewhere Nietzsche establishes the pervasiveness of agonism in life:
**["life is a consequence of war, society itself a means to
war]{.underline}**."36 But **[the denial of this permanent condition,
the effort to disguise it with a consensual rationality or to hide from
it with a fictional sovereignty, are all effects of this suppression of
fear. The desire for security is manifested as a collective resentment
of difference-- that which is not us, not certain, not predictable.
Complicit with a negative will to power is the fear-driven desire for
protection from the unknown.]{.underline}** Unlike the positive will to
power, which produces an aesthetic affirmation of difference**[, the
search for truth produces a truncated life which conforms to the
rationally knowable,]{.underline}** to the causally sustainable. In *The
Gay Science*, Nietzsche asks of the reader: "Look, isn't our need for
knowledge precisely this need for the familiar, the will to uncover
everything strange, unusual, and questionable, something that no longer
disturbs us? Is it not the *instinct of fear* that bids us to know? And
is the jubilation of those who obtain knowledge not the jubilation over
the restoration of a sense of security?"37 **[The fear of the unknown
and the desire for certainty combine to produce a domesticated life, in
which causality and rationality become the highest sign of a sovereign
self, the surest protection against contingent forces. The fear of fate
assures a belief that everything reasonable is true, and everything
true, reasonable. In short, the security imperative produces, and is
sustained by, the strategies of knowledge which seek to explain
it]{.underline}**. Nietzsche elucidates the nature of this generative
relationship in *The Twilight of the Idols*: The causal instinct is thus
conditional upon, and excited by, the feeling of fear. The "why?" shall,
if at all possible, not give the cause for its own sake so much as for a
*particular kind of cause*--a cause that is comforting, liberating and
relieving. \... That which is new and strange and has not been
experienced before, is excluded as a cause. Thus one not only searches
for some kind of explanation, to serve as a cause, but for a
particularly selected and preferred kind of explanation--that which most
quickly and frequently abolished the feeling of the strange, new and
hitherto unexperienced: the most *habitual* explanations.38 **[A safe
life requires safe truths. The strange and the alien remain unexamined,
the unknown becomes identified as evil, and evil provokes
hostility--recycling the desire for security. The "influence of
timidity,"]{.underline}** as Nietzsche puts it, **[creates a people who
are willing to subordinate affirmative values to the "necessities" of
security:]{.underline}** "they fear change, transitoriness: this
expresses a straitened soul, full of mistrust and evil experiences."39
**[The unknowable which cannot be contained by force or explained by
reason is relegated to the off-world.]{.underline}** "Trust," the
"good," and other common values come to rely upon an "artificial
strength": "the feeling of *security* such as the Christian possesses;
he feels strong in being able to trust, to be patient and composed: he
owes this artificial strength to the illusion of being protected by a
god."40 For Nietzsche, of course, only a false sense of security can
come from false gods: "Morality and religion belong altogether to the
*psychology of error*: in every single case, cause and effect are
confused; or truth is confused with the effects of *believing* something
to be true; or a state of consciousness is confused with its causes."41
Nietzsche's interpretation of the origins of religion can shed some
light on this paradoxical origin and transvaluation of security. In *The
Genealogy of Morals*, Nietzsche sees religion arising from a sense of
fear and indebtedness to one's ancestors: The conviction reigns that it
is only through the sacrifices and accomplishments of the ancestors that
the tribe *exists*--and that one has to *pay them back* with sacrifices
and accomplishments: one thus recognizes a *debt* that constantly grows
greater, since these forebears never cease, in their continued existence
as powerful spirits, to accord the tribe new advantages and new
strength.42 Sacrifices, honors, obedience are given but it is never
enough, for the ancestors of the *most powerful* tribes are bound
eventually to grow to monstrous dimensions through the imagination of
growing fear and to recede into the darkness of the divinely uncanny and
unimaginable: in the end the ancestor must necessarily be transfigured
into a *god*.43 As the ancestor's debt becomes embedded in institutions,
the community takes on the role of creditor. Nietzsche mocks this
originary, Hobbesian moment: to rely upon an "artificial strength": "the
feeling one lives in a community, one enjoys the advantages of
communality (oh what advantages! we sometimes underrate them today), one
dwells protected, cared for, in peace and trustfulness, without fear of
certain injuries and hostile acts to which the man *outside*, the "man
without peace," is exposed \... since one has bound and pledged oneself
to the community precisely with a view to injury and hostile acts.44
**[The establishment of the community is dependent upon, indeed it feeds
upon, this fear of being left outside. As the castle wall is replaced by
written treaty, however, and distant gods by temporal sovereigns, the
martial skills and spiritual virtues of the noble warrior are slowly
debased and dissimulated. The subject of the individual will to power
becomes the object of a collective resentment.]{.underline}** The
result? **[The fear of the external other is transvalued into the "love
of the neighbor"]{.underline}** quoted in the opening of this section,
and **[the perpetuation of community is assured through the
internalization and legitimation of a fear that lost its original source
long ago. This powerful nexus of fear, of external and internal
otherness, generates the values which uphold the security
imperative]{.underline}**. Indeed, Nietzsche locates the genealogy of
even individual rights, such as freedom, in the calculus of maintaining
security: My rights are that part of my power which others not merely
conceded me, but which they wish me to preserve. How do these others
arrive at that? First: through their prudence and fear and caution:
whether in that they expect something similar from us in return
(protection of their rights); or in that they consider that a struggle
with us would be perilous or to no purpose; or in that they see in any
diminution of our force a disadvantage to themselves, since we would
then be unsuited to forming an alliance with them in opposition to a
hostile third power. *Then*: by donation and cession.45 The point of
Nietzsche's critical genealogy is to show that the perilous conditions
that created the security imperative -- and the western metaphysics that
perpetuate it -- have diminished if not disappeared; yet, the fear of
life persists: "Our century denies this perilousness, and does so with a
good conscience: and yet it continues to drag along with it the old
habits of Christian security, Christian enjoyment, recreation and
evaluation."46 Nietzsche's worry is that **[the collective reaction
against older, more primal fears has created an even worse danger: the
tyranny of the herd, the lowering of man, the apathy of the last man
which controls through conformity and rules through passivity. The
security of the sovereign, rational self and state comes at the cost of
ambiguity, uncertainty, paradox -- all that makes a free life
worthwhile.]{.underline}** Nietzsche's lament for this lost life is
captured at the end of *Daybreak* in a series of rhetorical questions:
Of future virtues -- How comes it that the more comprehensible the world
has grown the more solemnities of every kind have decreased? Is it that
fear was so much the basic element of that reverence which overcame us
in the presence of everything unknown and mysterious and taught us to
fall down before the incomprehensible and plead for mercy? And has the
world not lost some of its charm for us because we have grown less
fearful? With the diminution of our fearfulness has our own dignity and
solemnity, our own *fearsomeness*, not also diminished?47 It is of
course in Nietzsche's lament, in his deepest pessimism for the last man,
that one finds the celebration of the overman as both symptom and
harbinger of a more free-spirited yet fearsome age. Dismissive of
utopian engineering, **[Nietzsche]{.underline}** never suggests how he
would restructure society; he **[looks forward]{.underline}** only so
far as **[to]{.underline}** sight **[the emergence of]{.underline}**
"new philosophers" (such as himself?) who would restore a reverence for
fear and reevaluate the security imperative. Nietzsche does, however, go
back to a pre-Christian, pre-Socratic era to find the exemplars for a
new kind of security. In *The Genealogy of Morals*, he holds up Pericles
as an example, for lauding the Athenians for their "*rhathymia*" -- a
term that incorporates the notion of "indifference to and contempt for
security."48 It is perhaps too much to expect Nietzsche's message to
resonate in late modern times, to expect, at the very time when
conditions seem most uncertain and unpredictable, that **[people would
treat fear as a stimulus for improvement rather than cause for
retrenchment. Yet Nietzsche would clearly see these as opportune times,
when fear could be willfully asserted as a force for the affirmation of
difference, rather than canalized into a cautious identity constructed
from the calculation of risks and benefits.]{.underline}** Baudrillard
and hyperrealism **[Like the real, warfare will no longer have any place
-- except precisely if the nuclear powers are successful in
de-escalation and manage to define new spaces for warfare. If military
power, at the cost of de-escalating this marvelously practical madness
to the second power, reestablishes a setting for warfare, a confined
space that is in fact human, then weapons will regain their use value
and their exchange value: it will again be possible to exchange
warfare.]{.underline}** --Jean Baudrillard, Fatal Strategies Fine
allegories, Baudrillard would say of Marx and Nietzsche. Nietzsche's
efforts to represent the deeper impulses behind the will to security, as
well as [Marx's effort to chart the origins of the struggle for power,
to pierce the veil of false consciousness that has postponed revolution,
to scientifically represent the world-to-be, are just examples of a
representational mirroring, a doubling of late-modernity's cartography
of the world-as-it-is. "For it is with the same Imperialism," says
Baudrillard, "that present-day simulators try to make the real, all the
real coincide with their simulation models."49 **Baudrillard goes beyond
Nietzsche in his interpretation of the death of god and the inability of
rational man or the proletariat to fill the resulting value-void with
stable distinctions between the real and the apparent, idea and
referent, good and evil. In the hyperbolic, often nihilistic, vision of
Baudrillard, the task of modernity is no longer to demystify or
disenchant illusion -- as Nietzsche realized, "with the real world we
have also abolished the apparent"**]{.underline} -- **[but to save the
reality principle, which in this case means, above all else, the
sovereign state acting in an anarchical order to maintain and if
possible expand its security and power in the face of penetrating,
de-centering forces, like the ICBM, global capital, military (and now
civilian) surveillance satellites, the international or domestic
terrorist, the telecommunications web, environmental movements and
transnational human rights conventions, to name a few of the more
obvious forces.]{.underline}** [In his now familiar words: "It is no
longer a question of a false representation of reality (ideology), but
of concealing the fact that the real is no longer real."]{.underline}51
The idea that reality is blurring, or has already disappeared into its
representational form, has a long lineage. It can be traced from
Siegfried Kracauer's chronicling of the emergence of a "cult of
distraction" in the Weimar Republic,52 to Walter Benjamin's incisive
warning of the loss of authenticity, aura, and uniqueness in the
technical reproduction of reality,53 to Guy Debord's claim that, in
modern conditions, spectacles accumulate and representations
proliferate54 and, finally, to Jean Baudrillard's own notification that
the simulated now precedes and engenders a hyperreality where origins
are forgotten and historical references lost.55 In his post-Marxist
work, [Baudrillard describes how the class struggle and the commodity
form dissolved into a universal play of signs, simulacra, and the
inertia of mass culture -- and the revolution went missing along with
the rest of reality. We are at end-times: but where Marx saw a
relentless, dialectical linearity in capitalism leading to social
revolution, Baudrillard sees only a passive population depending on the
virtuality of technology to save a defunct reality
principle.]{.underline} War serves as the ultima ratio of all four
thinkers. [The Gulf War, and the postwar attempt to set up a "new world
order," provides rich material for Baudrillard's thesis that security
has now entered the realm of hyperreality. Back in 1983, when
Baudrillard wrote of the renewed possibility of an "exchange of
warfare,"]{.underline} **[he had already spotted the dark side to a
possible end of the ultimate simulation of the Cold War, nuclear
deterrence.]{.underline}** And [if ever a war was "engendered and
preceded by simulation," it was the Gulf War. We were primed for this
war. **Simulations had infiltrated every area of our lives, in the form
of news (re)creations, video games, flight simulators, police
interrogations, crime reenactments and, of course, media war
games.**]{.underline}56 From the initial deployment of troops to the
daily order of battle, from the highest reaches of policymaking to the
lowest levels of field tactics and supply, a series of simulations made
the killing more efficient, more unreal, more acceptable.57

games took on a life of their own as the real war took the lives of more
than 100,000 Iraqis. But there is also evidence that simulations played
a critical role in the decision to go to war. In an interview, General
Norman Schwarzkopf revealed that, two years before the war, **[U.S.
intelligence discovered, in his words, that Iraq "had run computer
simulations and war games for the invasion of Kuwait]{.underline}**."58
In my own research, I learned that Iraq had previously purchased a
wargame from the Washington military-consulting firm BDM International
to use in its war against Iran; and almost as an aside, it was reported
in September 1990, on ABC Nightline, that the software for the Kuwait
invasion simulation was also purchased from a U.S. firm.59 Moreover,
Schwarzkopf stated that he programmed "possible conflicts with Iraq on
computers almost daily." Having previously served in Tampa, Florida as
head of the U.S. Central Command -- at the time a "paper" army without
troops, tanks, or aircraft of its own -- his affinity for simulations
was and is unsurprising. [In fact, Schwarzkopf sponsored a highly
significant computer-simulated command-post exercise that was played, in
late July 1990]{.underline}, under the code-name of "Exercise Internal
Look, '90." According to a Central Command news release issued at the
time, "command and control elements from all branches of the military
will be responding to real-world scenarios similar to those they might
be expected to confront within the Central Command AOR consisting of the
Horn of Africa, the Middle East and Southwest Asia." [The war game
specialist who put Exercise Internal Look together, Lt. General Yeosock,
moved from fighting "real-world scenarios" in Florida to command of all
ground troops -- except for the special forces under Schwarzkopf -- in
Saudi Arabia]{.underline}. Perhaps it is too absurd to believe that the
Gulf War was the product of one U.S. wargame designed to fight another
wargame bought by Iraq from an American company. Perhaps not. My purpose
is not to conduct an internal critique of the simulation industry, nor
to claim some privileged grounds for ascertaining the causes of the
war.60 Rather, my intent is to ask whether, in the construction of a
realm of meaning that had minimal contact with historically specific
events or actors, simulations demonstrated the power to construct the
reality they purport to represent--and international security suffered
for it. **[The question is whether simulations can create a new world
order where actors act, things happen, and the consequences have no
origins except the artificial cyberspace of the simulations
themselves]{.underline}**.61 [Indeed, over the last decade there has
been a profusion of signs that a simulation syndrome has taken hold in
international politics. According to Oleg Gordievsky, former KGB station
chief in London, the Soviet leadership became convinced in November 1983
that a NATO command-post simulation called "Able Archer '83" was, in
fact, the first step toward a nuclear surprise attack]{.underline}.62
[Relations were already tense after the September shootdown of KAL 007
-- a flight that the Soviets considered part of an
intelligence-gathering mission -- and since the Warsaw Pact had its own
wargame, which used a training exercise as cover for a surprise attack,
the Soviets assumed the West to have one as well. No NATO nuclear forces
went on actual alert, yet the KGB reported the opposite to Moscow. On
November 8 or 9, flash messages were sent to all Soviet embassies in
Europe, warning them of NATO preparations for a nuclear first strike.
Things calmed down when the Able Archer exercise ended without the
feared nuclear strike, but Gordievsky still maintains that only the
Cuban missile crisis brought the world closer to the brink of nuclear
war.]{.underline} [On a smaller, more conventional scale, the mistaking
of war for its simulation was repeated in July 1988, when the radar
operator and the tactical information coordinator of the U.S.S.
Vincennes misidentified an Iranian Airbus as an attacking Iranian F-14,
even though the ship's highly sophisticated Aegis radar system
registered an unknown airplane flying level at 12,000 feet. The nine
months of simulation training with computer tapes that preceded the
encounter proved more real than the reality of the moment. In effect,
the Airbus disap- peared before the surface-to-air missile struck,
transmuted from an airplane with 290 civilians into an electronic
representation on a radar screen and, then, into a simulated target. The
Gulf War is the preeminent, but probably not the last, case of a
simulation syndrome manifesting itself in the discourse of national
security. Baudrillard was right, in the sense that simulations would
rule not only in the war without warring of nuclear deterrence, but also
in the postwar warring of the present.63 It was never in question that
the coalition forces would win the military conflict. But they did not
win a "war," in the conventional sense of a destroying a reciprocating
enemy. What "war," then, did the U.S. win? A cyberwar of simulations.
First, the prewar simulation, Operation Internal Look '90, which
defeated the "Made in America" Iraqi simulation for the invasion of
Kuwait. Second, the war game of AirLand Battle, which defeated an Iraqi
army that resembled the game's intended enemy, the Warsaw Pact, in
hyperreality only. Third, the war of spectacle, which defeated the
spectacle of war on the battlefield of videographic reproduction. And
fourth, the postwar after-simulation of Vietnam, which defeated an
earlier defeat by assimilating Vietnam's history and lessons into the
victory of the Gulf War.]{.underline} Perhaps Baudrillard's and Marx's
worst scenarios have come true: **[the post-Cold War security state now
has the technology of simulation as well as the ideological advantage of
unipolarity to regenerate, at relatively low cost to itself, an ailing
national economy and identity through foreign adventures. We should
expect, then, endo- as well as exo-colonial wars, trade wars and
simulated wars to figure in the new world order. Iraq served its purpose
well as the enemy "other" that helped to redefine the Western identity:
but it was the other enemy, the more pervasive and elusive threat posed
by the de-territorialization of the state and the disintegration of a
bipolar order that has left us with a "Gulf War
Syndrome,"]{.underline}** in which the construction and destruction of
the enemy other is measured in time, not territory; prosecuted in the
field of perception, not politics; authenticated by technical
reproduction, not material referents; and played out in the method and
metaphor of gaming, not the history and horror of warring. Not a
conclusion but a provocation People in the newly sovereign republics of
the former Soviet Union report greater fear and insecurity than they
felt before they became independent. \... Indeed, the data show that the
greatest perceived threats are closest to home, with most of those asked
more fearful of their neighbors than anyone else, reflecting the
lingering unease among ethnic groups living side by side in the former
republics. --"Many in the Former Soviet Lands Say They Feel Even More
Insecure Now," Bruce Weber, New York Times, April 23, 1992. If security
is to have any significance for the future, it must find a home in the
new disorder through a commensurate deterritorialization of theory. We
can no longer reconstitute a single Hobbesian site of meaning or
reconstruct some Marxist or even neo-Kantian cosmopolitan community;
that would require a moment of enlightened universal certainty that
crumbled long before the Berlin Wall fell. Nor can we depend on or
believe in some spiritual, dialectical or scientific process to overcome
or transcend the domestic and international divisions, ambiguities, and
uncertainties that mark the age of speed, surveillance and simulation.
[This is why I believe the philosophical depth of Nietzsche has more to
offer than the hyperbolic flash of Baudrillard. Can we not interpret our
own foreign policy in the light of Nietzsche's critique of security? As
was the case with the origins of an ontotheological security, did not
our debt to the Founding Fathers grow "to monstrous dimensions" with our
"sacrifices" -- many noble, some not -- in two World Wars? Did not our
collective identity, once isolationist, neutralist and patriotic, become
transfigured into a new god, that was born and fearful of a nuclear,
internationalist, interventionist power? The evidence is in the
reconceptualization: as distance, oceans and borders became less of a
protective barrier to alien identities, and a new international economy
required penetration into other worlds, national interest became too
weak a semantic guide. We found a stronger one in national security, as
embodied and institutionalized in the National Security Act of 1947, as
protected by the McCarran-Walter Act of 1952, and as recon- structed by
the first, and subsequent National Security Council meetings of the
second cold war. **Nietzsche speaks a credible truth to increasingly
incredible regimes. He points toward a way in which we might live with
and recognize the very necessity of difference. He recognizes the need
to assert heterogeneity against the homogenizing and often brutalizing
forces of progress. And he eschews all utopian schemes to take us out of
the "real" world for a practical strategy to celebrate, rather than
exacerbate, the anxiety, insecurity and fear of a new world order where
radical otherness is ubiquitous and indomitable.**]{.underline}

#### Rhetoric of deterrence covers the global extension of absolute securitization

**Baudrillard '81** (Jean, Simulacra and Simulation: The Orbital and the
Nuclear, 1981)

The apotheosis of simulation: the nuclear. However, [[the balance of
terror is]{.underline}]{.mark} never anything but [[the spectacular
slope of a system of deterrence that has insinuated itself from the
inside into all the cracks of daily life]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Nuclear
suspension]{.underline} only serves to seal the trivialized system of
deterrence that is at the heart of the media, of [the violence without
consequences that reigns throughout the world]{.underline}, of the
aleatory apparatus of all the choices that are made for us. The most
insignificant of our behaviors is regulated by neutralized, indifferent,
equivalent signs, by zero-sum signs like those that regulate the
\"strategy of games\" (but the true equation is elsewhere, and the
unknown is precisely that variable of simulation which makes of the
atomic arsenal itself a hyperreal form, [[a simulacrum that dominates
everything and reduces all \"ground-level\" events to being nothing but
ephemeral scenarios]{.mark}, [transforming the life left us into
survival]{.mark}]{.underline}, into [[a stake without
stakes]{.underline}]{.mark} - not even into a life insurance policy:
into [[a policy that already has no value]{.underline}]{.mark}). It is
not the direct threat of atomic destruction that paralyzes our lives, it
is deterrence that gives them leukemia. And this deterrence comes from
that fact that even [the real atomic clash is precluded]{.underline} -
precluded like the eventuality of the real in a system of signs. [[The
whole world pretends to believe in the reality of]{.mark} this
[threat]{.mark}]{.underline} (this is understandable on the part of the
military, the gravity of their exercise and the discourse of their
\"strategy\" are at stake), but it is precisely at this level that
[[there are no strategic stakes]{.mark}.]{.underline} The whole
originality of the situation lies in the improbability of destruction.
[[Deterrence precludes war]{.mark} - [the archaic violence of expanding
systems]{.mark}. [Deterrence]{.mark}]{.underline} itself
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} the neutral, [[implosive
violence]{.underline}]{.mark} of metastable systems or systems in
involution. There is no longer a subject of deterrence, nor an adversary
nor a strategy - [[it is a planetary structure of the annihilation of
stakes]{.mark}. [Atomic war]{.mark}]{.underline}, like the Trojan War,
[[will not take place.]{.mark} [The risk of nuclear annihilation only
serves as a pretext,]{.mark}]{.underline} through the sophistication of
weapons (a sophistication that surpasses any possible objective to such
an extent that it is itself a symptom of nullity), [[for installing a
universal security system]{.underline}]{.mark}, a universal lockup and
control system whose deterrent effect is not at all aimed at an atomic
clash (which was never in question, except without a doubt in the very
initial stages of the cold war, when one still confused the nuclear
apparatus with conventional war) but, rather, at the much greater
probability of any real event, of anything that would be an event in the
general system and upset its balance. [[The balance of terror is the
terror of balance]{.underline}]{.mark}. Deterrence is not a strategy, it
circulates and is exchanged between nuclear protagonists exactly as is
international capital in the orbital zone of monetary speculation whose
fluctuations suffice to control all global exchanges. Thus the money of
destruction (without any reference to real destruction, any more than
floating capital has a real referent of production) that circulates in
nuclear orbit suffices to control all the violence and potential
conflicts around the world. What is hatched in the shadow of this
mechanism with the pretext of a maximal, \"objective,\" threat, and
thanks to [[Damocles\' nuclear sword, is the perfection of the best
system of control that has ever existed]{.underline}]{.mark}. And the
progressive satellization of the whole planet through this hypermodel of
security.

#### The attempt to ensure survival terminates in a life denying politics 

**Baudrillard 88.** Jean Baudrillard, America, pg. 42

[Everywhere [survival has become **a burning
issue**]{.mark}]{.underline}, perhaps [by some obscure weariness of life
or a collective desire for catastrophe (though we should not take all
this too seriously: it is also a playing at catastrophe)]{.underline}.
Certainly, [this [whole panoply of **survival issues**]{.mark} -
[dieting]{.mark}, [ecology]{.mark}, saving the sequoias, [seals]{.mark}
or the [human race]{.mark} - tends [to **prove** ]{.mark}**that [we
are]{.mark} very much [alive]{.mark}** (just as all imaginary
fairy-tales tend to **prove that the real world is very
real**]{.underline}). But [this is not so certain, for not only is the
fact of living not really well-attested, but [the paradox of]{.mark}
this [society is]{.mark} that [you **cannot** ]{.mark}**even [die in
it]{.mark} any more [since you are already dead]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
. . This is real suspense. [And it is not simply **an effect of living
in the nuclear age**, but derives from the ease with which we now live,
which makes survivors of us all]{.underline}. [[If the **bomb drops**,
we shall \[not]{.mark}\] **neither** [have]{.mark} the **time** to die
nor [**any awareness** of dying]{.mark}. But already in our
hyper-protected society we **no longer have any awareness of death**,
since we have subtly passed over into a state where **life is
excessively easy**.]{.underline}

[The holocaust created an anticipatory form]{.underline} of such a
condition. [What the inmates of the concentration camps were deprived of
was the very possibility of having control of their own deaths, of
playing, even gambling with their own deaths, making their deaths a
sacrifice: they were **robbed of power over their own
deaths**]{.underline}. And **[this is what is happening to all of us, in
slow, homeopathic doses, by virtue of the very development of our
systems]{.underline}**. [The **explosions** and the extermination
(Auschwitz and Hiroshima) **still go on**, though they have simply taken
on a **purulent, endemic form**]{.underline}. The chain reaction
continues nonetheless, the contagion, the unfolding of the viral and
bacteriological process. The end of history was precisely the
inauguration of this chain reaction.

**[[The obsessive desire for survival]{.mark} (and [not]{.mark} for
[life]{.mark}) [is a symptom of this state of affairs and doubtless also
the most worrying sign of the degradation of the
species]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [[If you think about the **forms** that
**desire currently takes** -antinuclear shelters, cryogenization,
high-pressure therapy - you see that they are **exactly the forms of
extermination**]{.underline}.]{.mark} [To avoid dying, one chooses to
withdraw into some protective bubble or other]{.underline}. In this
light, we should take it as a reassuring sign that people lost interest
in antinuclear protection so quickly (the shelter market has become a
mere prestige market, like the market for artworks or luxury yachts).
[It seems that people have become **tired of nuclear blackmail** and
decided not to give in to it, leaving the threat of destruction hanging
in mid-air over them, perhaps with an obscure sense of how unreal it is.
A fine example of a vital reaction disguised as resignation. **'[If we
have to die, better to die in the open air than in an underground
sarcophagus.]{.mark}'** At a stroke an end is put to survival blackmail
and life can go on]{.underline}.

[Everyone is weary of these apocalyptic visions - the great scenario of
the nuclear threat, the theatrical negotiations, 'Star
Wars']{.underline}. In the end, **[they defend themselves with a lack of
imagination]{.underline}**. [Even attempts to stimulate that
imagination]{.underline} in films like The Last Day [have not
worked]{.underline}. **[Nothing has ever been able to make this nuclear
scene - or obscenity - credible]{.underline}**. [With delicate matters
like this (as with cancer), **imagining death has the effect of bringing
the fatal event closer**]{.underline}. [**[The masses' silent
indifference to nuclear pathos]{.mark}** (whether it comes from the
nuclear powers or from antinuclear campaigners) [is]{.mark} therefore
**[a great sign of hope and a political fact of the utmost
importancse]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

### Set Col

#### The spectacle allows the policy debate community to re-perform the journey from the 'savage frontier' to 'civilization.' This commodification of indigeneity [erases]{.underline} native perspectives, reducing them to a shadow behind societal improvement, and allows [whiteness to consolidate itself]{.underline}.

Debord's central thesis or provocation is that life in a
"**[commodity-saturated, mass mediated, image-dominated and
corporate-constructed world" engenders an increasingly isolated,
alienated, and passive citizenry that unwittingly relents to a
groupthink of market consciousness disguised as individual
agency]{.underline}** (Kaplan 2012, p. 458). [His analysis illuminates
the inherent paradox of spectacle; **despite** (or because of) **its
intention to illicit emotion and (re)action, [spectacle produces
alienation and passivity]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**Particularly in a mass-mediated, hi-tech society[, the sheer volume
of content]{.mark} alone [can produce a deadening effect]{.mark}.** But
spectacle is both dialectical and self-perpetuating. Meaning, [the
resulting]{.mark} (individual and social) [ennui searches for
relief]{.mark} from the deadening effect [and]{.mark}, in so doing,
[activates the production of ever more spectacular imagery]{.mark},
generating an endless and alienating cycle of (simulated) life in search
of the "real." **As the search intensifies, so does the desire for
anything perceived as "authentic" -- authenticity is the
antidote**]{.underline} (For early and consistently excellent
discussions of the desire for "authentic" nature and culture see the
work of Dean MacCannell 1976.). [It is this cycle -- the positioning of
spectacularity against "authenticity" and authenticity as the antidote
to the (post)modernist condition -- that compels this analysis,
particularly in the wake of #NoDAPL]{.underline}. For **[[as long as
"Indians" have been situated as the (authentic) anti-modern subject,
"Indian-ness" has perennially served as a favored foil (antidote) for
whiteness.]{.mark}]{.underline}** While many Indigenous studies scholars
have examined the ways in which **[[Native identity is appropriated in
the service of white identity formation]{.underline}]{.mark}** (e.g.,
Berkhofer 1987; Deloria 1969, 1998; Huhndorf 2001), my interest is cast
more broadly. That is, beyond questions of white identity formation:
[How does the expressed desire for the imagined Indian serve the
propertied interests of whiteness, which is to say settler
statecraft?]{.underline} To explore this question, I begin with more
mundane expressions of Indian-as-spectacle and move toward their deeper
implications. Currently, there are 20 [[reality shows]{.mark} in
circulation]{.underline} that stage interventions (read: [[provide
antidotes) for the normative hegemony of white-middle-class life by
depicting life on the "frontier" or "the wild]{.underline}."]{.mark}
(Among the current shows are: [Survivor, Colonial House, Alaska Bush
People, Frontier House, and Man vs. Wild.)]{.underline} Through their
ubiquity and popularity, [[such shows evidence the extent of
settler-desire for the imperialist fantasy of "pre-modernist" times at
the same time they appease settler supremacy]{.underline}. **[They
refract]{.underline}**]{.mark} what McLintock (McClintock and Robertson
1994) refers to as "panoptical time," (More specifically, McLintock
(1994) defines panoptical time as "**[[the image of global history
consumed]{.mark} -- at a glance -- [in a single spectacle from the point
of privileged invisibility]{.mark}]{.underline}**" (p. 128).) **[a key
component of imperialist discourse that situates progress as
fundamentally contingent upon on a "shadow other," which is, of course,
the savage]{.underline}** (Pardy 2010). Indeed, as noted by Rosaldo
(1989) "**[In this ideologically constructed world of ongoing
progressive change, [putatively static savage societies become a stable
reference point for defining\...civilized
identity]{.mark}]{.underline}**" (p. 70). **[[Native peoples are]{.mark}
so much "a shadow]{.underline}**" that with the exception of one show
(Frontier House) **[they are not even present -- literally [eliminated
from settler view.]{.mark}]{.underline}** In this sense, **[[progress
is]{.mark} the central character, [so critical to settler mythology that
it drives a deep-seeded need to continually perform the fabled journey
from savage to civilized]{.mark} over and over again; settler-subjects
playing out fantasies of the colonial encounter as
theater.]{.underline}** There was one reality show about Native peoples
-- Escaping Alaska -- which, depicted five Alaska Native youth
(identified as "Eskimos") "secretly" plotting to leave their families
and homeland in order to experience life in the lower 48. True to
Debord's thesis, **[the society of the spectacle can only produce
grotesque caricatures]{.underline}**. In this instance, [Inuit youth are
depicted as members of a virtual cult that apparently holds their
members' captive and in complete ignorance of the "outside"
world]{.underline}. [Baloy]{.underline} (2016) [theorizes]{.underline}
the oscillation between the complete erasure and hyperreality of
Indigenous peoples in terms of "spectrality" (i.e., a state of
haunting). She deploys the term "**[holographic Indigeneity" to describe
the phenomena of Native peoples hyper-visibility "from some angles" and
invisibility from others -- always a constant presence even in moments
of apparent absence]{.underline}** (p. 209).

#### They will claim that their advocacy is a radical reconning. But settlers enjoy being called out so they can honor the Native victims and register their feelings of offense, rinsing themselves of guilt without enacting any real changes.

Smith (eds.), Handbook of Indigenous Education

Lakota scholar Phil Deloria (1999) documents how [the oscillation
between settler desire and repulsion for Indian-ness has manifested
through the long-standing practice of **"playing Indian."** Dating back
at least as far as the Boston Tea Party (1773) when the "Sons of
Liberty" staged their protest wearing headdresses and war
paint]{.underline}, Deloria demonstrates how [the spectacle of "playing
Indian" has been a persistent feature of the search for "authentic"
American identity.]{.underline} **[[The advent of digital technology and
social media]{.mark} has only [enabled the speed and scope of]{.mark}
this [cultural spectacle, producing an abundant archive of Indians of
the settler imagination]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Baloy's (Baloy 2016)
research demonstrates that, indeed, [the main source of people's
information on and experience with Indigeneity comes through
media.]{.underline} Thus, [from Victoria's Secret models in full
headdress to grotesque sports mascots and fans in red-face, settlers
play out their "uneasiness" with the violence of the settler project in
full, spectacular display.]{.underline} In theorizing the space between
spectacle, cultural politics and neoliberalism, Giroux (2009) draws upon
the insights of British media theorist Nick Couldry (2008) who discerns,
"every system of cruelty requires its own theatre" (p. 3). As noted by
Couldry, while some forms of cruelty depend on secrecy, [systems of
cruelty require legitimation via public and "ritualized
performance"]{.underline} (p. 3). Using settler colonialism as an
illustrative example, his reasoning would go something like this: (a)
**[[Settler colonialism is a system of cruelty.]{.mark} (b) [The
"truths" of which are unacceptable to democratic society if stated
openly.]{.mark} (c) [Those truths must be "translated into ritual that
enacts, as 'play', an acceptable version of the values and compulsions
on which that cruelty depends"]{.mark}]{.underline}** (p. 3). Reality
television is one example of the "theater of cruelty" wherein [the
rituals of everyday life under settler colonialism are "enacted as play"
in order to "legitimate its norms, values, institutions, and social
practices"]{.underline} (Giroux 2008, p. 224). [Though often dismissed
as innocent fun, [mediated performances that erase or perpetuate gross
caricatures of Native peoples have systemic impact.]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[Unfortunately, this impact is typically framed in psychological
terms, playing out something like this: (1) [Offending settlers are
called out]{.mark} on their racism; (2) [they attest to their good
intentions]{.mark} and express desire to honor and respect the lifeways
of Native peoples as well as regret for hurt feelings; (3) [Native
"victims" of said "honoring" (re)register their feelings of offense and
outrage]{.mark}, often citing harm to their self-esteem and identity
formation; and (4) [Rinse. Repeat]{.mark}.]{.underline}** While I
ultimately urge moving beyond this psychologizing discourse, I want to
be clear that research evidencing the latent, direct, and collateral
damage of racial stereotyping is both chilling and definitive (see
Pewewardy 1991, 2004; Fryberg and Markus 2004; Fryberg et al. 2008).
**[The bullying, harassment, and discrimination that occur as a result
of the regular and persistent misrepresentation of Native peoples are an
affront to their dignity and to the democratic aspirations of the
nation.]{.underline}** That said, I argue that [[an exclusive focus on
the psychological is deeply insufficient and perhaps complicit in
maintaining imperialist relations and discourses.]{.underline} [The
preoccupation with psychological trauma draws attention away from the
material conditions of Indigenous peoples and violent strategies of the
settler state]{.underline}]{.mark} [(i.e., dispossession).]{.underline}
**[[The violence of this erasure is]{.underline}]{.mark}** captured in
Rosaldo's (1989) notion of "**[[imperialist nostalgia," which links
settler desire for an imagined past to a politics of death and
mourning]{.underline}]{.mark}** (p. 107). As Rosaldo (1993) writes:
\...**[someone deliberately alters a form of life, and then regrets that
things have not remained as they were prior to the
intervention\...[people destroy their environment, and then they worship
nature]{.mark}. In any of its versions, [imperialist nostalgia uses a
pose of 'innocent yearning']{.mark} both [to capture people's
imaginations and]{.mark} to [conceal its complicity with]{.mark} often
brutal [domination]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} (pp. 69--70) As
theorized by Baloy (2016), **[the dialectical relationship between
[spectacle and imperialist nostalgia provides the conceptual frame
through which settlers imagine Native peoples]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
That is, **[as mediated, spectacularized versions of "the Indian"
dominate the collective consciousness of settler society, [it functions
to erase the lived experience of Indigenous peoples: hypervisibility =
invisibility]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} In other words,
[**spectacle facilitates "imperialist nostalgia" and the passive
consumption of Indigenous performance at the expense of actual
Indigenous voices and histories.** In terms of Standing
Rock]{.underline}, [Baloy's work also helps explain the relative
invisibility of the Sioux peoples and Indigenous water protectors as
well as the hypervisibility of the more spectacular "#NoDAPL
"warrior]{.underline}." Indeed, [from the beginning of the encampment
(April 1, 2016) to the moment that the Army Corps of Engineers announced
the (temporary) denial of the easement, mainstream media as a whole,
essentially covered three (spectacular) events: (1) the police use of
water cannons on protectors in subfreezing temperatures (November 21,
2016); (2) the arrival of thousands of veterans (December 2, 2016); and,
(3) the "victory" celebrations following the Army Corps of Engineers
announcement]{.underline} (December 4, 2016). While spectacle clearly
drew their attention, FAIR reports that more often than not, the
coverage was "limited, biased, and/or inaccurate" (For example, FAIR
condemned the New York Times headline that read, "16 Arrested at North
Dakota Pipeline Protest as Tensions Continue," noting that there had
been more than 470 arrests. They also called out the framing of events
as a "clash" between protesters and police by NPR, CBS, and ABC writing:
"This 'clash' framing -- also utilized in headlines on CBS (11/20/16)
and CNN (11/20/16) -- implies a parity between police in military
vehicles, employing water cannons, tear gas, pepper spray, rubber-coated
bullets, and concussion grenades (one of which may have cost an activist
her arm), on the one hand, and basically unarmed civilians on the other
(Police say one officer was hit in the head by a thrown rock.)." And
finally, FAIR took issue with the Washington Post headline (11/21/16)
framing the attack from a police perspective: "Police Defend Use of
Water Cannons on Dakota Access Protesters in Freezing Weather") Water
protectors were consistently misrepresented as protestors (not
protectors), agitators, and trespassers engaged in a "clash" with Morton
County officials and Energy Transfer Partners; such false equivalences
between unarmed peaceful protectors and heavily armed officers and their
billionaire corporate backers can only be drawn through erasures of
history and power. **[[The gestalt of such coverage serves to perpetuate
the myths of the settler project: the vanishing Indian, the benevolent
colonizer, justified conquest, and the liberal (settler) state as the
epitome of progress.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

#### Spectacularization feeds the image of the benevolent colonizer. This normalizes settler colonialism and encourages the colonizer to 'double-down' on colonialism, making it more extreme.

**[[The intensification of cruelty under neoliberalism]{.mark} has
brought with it a renewed press to [draw the]{.mark} liberal subject
(i.e., "[benevolent colonizer") into its theater, raising the bar for
even more spectacular productions of American exceptionalism,]{.mark}
which is to say settler supremacy.]{.underline}** As observed by Giroux
(2008), "What is often ignored by many theorists who analyze the rise of
**[neoliberalism]{.underline}** is that it **[isn't only a system of
economic power relations, but also a political project of governing and
persuasion intent on producing new forms of subjectivity and particular
modes of conduct"]{.underline}** (p. 224). Indeed, **[the construction
of the settler state has, at every stage, relied on identity and
cultural politics for its reconsolidation, requiring and soliciting
certain ways of being, desiring, and knowing at the same time it
destroys others]{.underline}** (Agathangelou 2008; Duggan 2012).
**[[Productions in its theater of cruelty rely on spectacle to obscure
and "smuggle" past the violent rituals of settler colonialism as
normative.]{.underline}]{.mark}** For example, [it is not difficult to
see how Trump rallies set the stage for the normativization of white
supremacy as "alt-right" or even "white nationalism" expressed in
slogans such as "Make America Great Again." The consequences of which
gave rise to one of the most brazen, public displays of white supremacy
and consolidation in a long time: the "Unite the Right" rally in
Charlottesville, North Carolina.]{.underline} [Despite the fact that the
rally resulted in the death of Heather Heyer and injury of 19 other
rally protestors, Trump has continually insisted that there was violence
and culpability on "both sides."]{.underline} Such false equivalences
are issued as code to his white supremacist base to draw back and
inward, to circle the wagons once again, around who is what counts as
white, as superior, as manifest destined colonizer. Ultimately, however,
as Memmi (1991) argues, "colonization can only disfigure the colonizer"
(p. 147). As he sees it, [the settler subject has only two choices, both
of which are equally "disastrous": the acceptance of "daily injustice"
for one's own benefit on the one hand or a "never consummated
self-sacrifice"]{.underline} on the other (pp. 147--148). And, **[[since
a life of guilt, shame, and anguish is virtually "unlivable,"]{.mark}
Memmi surmises that [the colonizer will]{.mark} typically choose to
"[confirm and defend the colonial system in every
way"]{.mark}]{.underline}** (p. 147). That said, he also wonders, "but
what privileges, what advantages, are worth the loss of his soul?" (p.
148). And therein lies the essence of settler "uneasiness." The apparent
hopelessness of the settler problem raises important questions about the
structure and potential of social movements, coalition building, and the
possibility of transformation. Questions asked with even greater urgency
as the United States joins the global, right-wing turn toward
authoritarian populism.

#### The colonialist project must be refused as a whole as a means of life. Spectacular images of resistance only produce exhibitionist thrills for colonists to enjoy, preventing solvency. We must resist the politics of representation.

#NoDAPL anti-colonial struggle is profoundly anti-capitalist. It is the
Frontline. It is the future (Estes 2016) I used to tell people when I
was young who asked, 'what do you Indians want?' 'the right to be left
alone to live'\...now I don't see that as an option. Now we must do our
best to live and show the rest of the world how to live. (Ladonna Brave
Bull 2016) Water Is Life This simple but profound refrain became the
rallying cry for the #NoDAPL movement (At its height, #NoDAPL was a
global movement, drawing Indigenous peoples and allies from across the
world; from New Zealand, Canada Australia, Ecuador, Peru, Hawaii,
Mexico, and Belize among other nations.). The Lakota peoples and their
allies gathered along the Mni Sose (Missouri River) and on the lands of
the Oceti Sakowin (The Great Sioux Nation) to defend water and life. Led
by Native youth and women, water protectors put their bodies on the
frontlines of a 241-year war (and counting) against the ever-encroaching
settler state. In this most recent battle, the objective was to block
the Dakota Access Pipeline (re)routed by the Energy Transfer corporation
to pass under Lake Oahe (the tribes water source) and across the Treaty
lands and burial grounds of the Lakota peoples. Indigenous struggles to
defend water, land and other relations operate well beyond the
left-right continuum of American politics. It's always been "Indians"
vs. settler, regardless of political party (Consider, for example, that
under President Obama -- often viewed as the #NoDAPL savior -- US oil
production grew to reach 9.4 million bpd in 2015; the largest domestic
oil production increase during any presidency in US history.). This is
why **[the colonialist project is about elimination. Not assimilation.
Not incorporation. Not accommodation. It is also why, [for Indigenous
peoples]{.mark}, the [struggle is not grounded in]{.mark} claims for
[recognition]{.mark} or reconciliation. [It is about refusal. Refusal
equals life.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Introduction This chapter examines
the relationship between spectacle (Among the various theorizations of
spectacle (e.g., Barthes, Crary, McLuhan), this chapter draws heavily
upon the work of Foucault and Debord. Specifically, Foucault's
understanding of spectacle in terms of surveillance and Debord's notion
of spectacle as ideological, more broadly linked to capitalism, market
consciousness, and a "society of the spectacle" figure prominently.) and
settler colonialism. [I am particularly interested in the role that
spectacle plays in the solidification of the settler state and the
consolidation of whiteness, particularly as intensified under
neoliberalism.]{.underline} Moreover, while the implications of settler
colonialism for Native peoples are or, should be, self-evident, I also
consider the implications for the nonindigenous settler subject. As
Memmi posits, "**[[the benevolent colonizer]{.mark}]{.underline}** (To
be clear, Memmi's notion of the "benevolent colonizer"
**[[is]{.underline}]{.mark}** a referent to **[the
[self-effacing]{.mark} colonizer who [refuses the ideology of
colonialism but still lives within it]{.mark}s confines]{.underline}**
(Memmi, p. 64). In contemporary parlance, they might be considered white
allies.) can never attain the good, for his only choice is not between
good and evil, but between evil and uneasiness" (Crary 1989, p. 87).
Throughout this chapter, [the spectacular portrayal of Indigenous
peoples generally and of the #NoDAPL prayer camps more specifically,
serves as a site in which to explore the contours of this
"uneasiness."]{.underline} Writing in the late 1960s, French theorist
Guy Debord penned his cautionary text the Society of the Spectacle
(1967), wherein he laments the displacement of "authentic" social
relations with their false representations under advanced capitalism. He
writes, "[In societies dominated by modern conditions of production,
life is presented as an immense accumulation of spectacles. Everything
that was directly lived has receded into representation]{.underline}"
(#1). Bracketing his modernist discourse, [the]{.underline} deeper
[salience of Debord's analysis is its marking of the move from life in a
market economy to life in a market society]{.underline} and the shifts
that engender the "degradation of being into having" and from having to
appearing (#17). He writes: **[\...(Spectacle) is not a mere decoration
added to the real world. It is the very heart of this real society's
unreality. In all of its particular manifestations -- news, propaganda,
advertising, entertainment -- the spectacle represents the dominant
model of life\...In both form and content (it) serves as a total
justification of the conditions and goals of the existing system
(#6).]{.underline}** Considering that his treatise was written well
before the digital age and hyperrealtity of the twenty-first century,
the corpus of Debord's argument remains remarkably prescient. [[Under
neoliberalism, the speed, scope, and power of spectacle]{.mark} has only
[intensified, reconfiguring]{.mark} the very character of [life as not
only conditioned by consumerism and commercialization but largely
replaced by, exchanged for]{.mark}, and even rejected in favor of its
[more spectacular simulations]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Think, for example,
of the blurring lines between "real" and fake news and "real" and
digital lives.]{.underline} [Under spectacle-capitalism virtually every
institution, every mode of being has been commodified to the point where
it isn't only that everything is for sale but that life itself is
monetized and only worth living if it is on display]{.underline}
([Consider for example the ways in which sex (e.g., Grinder, Tinder),
love, and intimacy (e.g., eHarmony, cuddle businesses) and even marriage
(e.g., Married at First Sight, the Bachelor) have not only been
commodified but also put on display]{.underline}.). As Gamson (Gamson
2011) observes, [we have moved beyond the notion that "everyone gets
fifteen minutes of fame" into a time when "everyone already is a
star]{.underline}" (p. 1068). [Consider]{.underline}, for example, [the
rapid proliferation of social media celebrities]{.underline} (Consider,
for example, [the phenomena of the YouTube celebrity]{.underline} with
personalities such as PewDiePie amassing 54.1 million "followers" and a
net worth of \$15 million for being a "foul mouthed" video-game
commentator. Such "celebrities" are beginning to surpass the wealth and
popularity of "traditional" Hollywood stars. See, for example, https://
www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/03/why-youtube-stars-popular-zoella)
who generate large fandoms, millions of followers and dollars, from
simply "sharing" curated and staged slices of their lives. While life in
the infinite public raises a variety of important questions about what
it means to be human, my central concern remains with how **[[the
culture industry (re) produces exhibitions of self and other that works
to consolidate whiteness and secure settler
futurity]{.underline}]{.mark}** (I understand the motif of
"**[futurity]{.underline}**" -- with an intellectual genealogy **[that
traces back to]{.underline}** John L. O'Sullivan's, treatise on
**[manifest destiny -- as an exclusively settler construct that is
incommensurable with Indigeneity]{.underline}**.). That is, **[[insofar
as spectacle is contingent upon the radical reification of self, an
overvaluing of the present, and rupturing of relationality, it becomes
the perfect theater for producing anchorless (neoliberal) subjects whose
every desire is increasingly structured by
capital]{.mark}.]{.underline}** As **[[it forecloses relationality by
normalizing disconnection, it effects an erasure of Indigenous
peoples]{.mark} who continue to define themselves through relationship
-- to land, to history, to ancestors, to all our
relations.]{.underline}** Consider, for example, how [the water
protectors at Standing Rock were only rendered visible through
spectacle]{.underline} (According to Fairness and Accuracy in Media
(FAIR), **[by September of 2016, of the three major broadcast news
networks, only CBS filed a story on Standing Rock]{.underline}**.
Moreover, that story aired at 4 a.m. and was actually a re-reporting of
a 48-word NPR story. FAIR also noted that while NPR's original version
featured Amy Goodman's footage of the unprovoked attack on the
protectors, CBS chose to exclude it.). **[That is,
[until]{.mark}]{.underline}** and outside of the widelycirculated
**[[images of armored vehicles, riot police, water cannons, war bonnets,
tee pees and painted ponies, the Lakota peoples hardly existed]{.mark},
virtually erased from public consciousness]{.underline}** (It should be
noted that the few articles published in the press on this history were
written by Native American scholars. For example, see: Nick Estes,
"Fighting for Our Lives: #NoDAPL in Historical Context" (The Red Nation
2016) and Julian Brave NoiseCat and Anne Spice, "A History and Future of
Resistance" (Jacobin Magazine 2016). Also, while independent media
(e.g., Unicorn Riot, Anti-Media, AJ+) provided coverage, they also
deployed spectacle as a means of drawing attention. As reported by
Anti-Media, "Where the mainstream media failed, the independent media
relentlessly covered the protests." Livestream coverage of the
spectacular attacks was indeed relentlessly posted, often creating
confusion about the level of violence at the camps. [The nonspectacular
reality was that the overwhelming majority of time at the Oceti Sakowin
encampment was spent in prayer, cooking, training, eating, laughing,
building, teaching, working, washing, cleaning, singing, listening,
reading, and tending.).]{.underline} [**That is, except when needed as
stand-ins for the "shame" of America**. The reality, however, is that
Standing Rock, from the Ghost Dances (1800s) to the occupation of
Wounded Knee (1973), has long served as a site of collective,
anti-colonialist, anti-capitalist Indigenous resistance and, that time
and again, the Oceti Sakowin have stood on the front lines, protecting
against the forces of US imperialism. **Lost to the compressed space of
spectacular time is the architecture of settler violence -- Red Cloud's
War (1866--1868); the War for the Black Hills (1876); the Indian
Appropriations Act (1877); Wounded Knee (1890); the Dawes Allotment Act
(1887); the Flood Control Act (1944); the Indian Relocation Act (1956)
-- and the multi-layered history that provides the context for what
should have been the one and only #NoDAPL headline -- ["Unceasing
Settler Violence Masquerading as Democracy Continues to Dispossess
Native peoples."]{.mark}**]{.underline}

#### Their research method colludes with the form of semiotic capitalism. Their pro-indigenous pedagogy orients affect and imagination into the colonial machine to [bolster]{.underline} global capitalism while appealing to indigenous knowledge as a solution to [its own ecological crises.]{.underline} This not only makes capitalism worse; it creates a mode of cruel optimism that [abstracts from]{.underline} indigenous knowledge so that we can reduce the Other to an object of consumption.

Many [Green [activists turn to indigenous knowledge]{.mark} as a way of
[restoring to]{.mark} contemporary []{.mark}consumer [capital]{.mark}
some of [the values of traditional societies]{.mark}. The
problems]{.underline} with this [are **manifold**. Firstly, [they
presume]{.mark} that [**distinction** between **modernity** and
**tradition** which is]{.mark} **at [the heart of
coloniality]{.mark}**[.]{.mark} Second, [they presume that values
**other than economic** can be rendered]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[**compatible** with the **exclusively economic** value system of
**neo-liberalism**]{.underline}.]{.mark} And [third, [they believe in a
bounded and appropriable mode of knowledge on the Western
model]{.mark}]{.underline}. As Anishinaabe researcher Leanne Simpson
notes of an instance from the 1990s when researchers flocked to
indigenous Canadians seeking traditional ecological knowledge[,
\'outside [researchers were]{.mark} **not interested in all kinds of
knowledge**, and they remain specifically interested in knowledge that
parallels the western scientific discipline of ecology or the
\"environment\", and they are often **[looking]{.mark} specifically f[or
information]{.mark} that presents [solutions to their own]{.mark}**
pending ecological **[crises\']{.mark}**]{.underline} (Simpson 2001:
138-9). Linda Tuhiwai Smith makes the case that [[this **divorce** of
indigenous knowledge from the people]{.mark} to whom it is
proper]{.underline} (but not property) [[is]{.mark} not only [an abuse
of power,]{.mark} but [undertaken]{.mark}, with whatever motives on the
part of well-meaning anthropologists, [in]{.mark} the **frame of a
[globalization]{.mark}** [of Western economic values]{.mark}: the
[people and]{.mark} their [culture]{.mark}, the [material and]{.mark}
the [spiritual]{.mark}, the exotic and the fantastic, [became]{.mark}
not just the stuff of dreams and imagination, or stereotypes and
eroticism, but of **the first truly [global commercial
enterprise]{.mark}**[: **trading the Other**]{.mark}. . . . It is
concerned more with ideas, languages, knowledge, images, beliefs and
fantasies than any other industry. [Trading the Other]{.mark} deeply,
intimately, [defines Western thinking and identity.]{.mark} As a trade,
it has no concern for the peoples who originally produced the ideas or
images . . . Trading the Other is big business. For indigenous peoples
trading ourselves is not on the agenda]{.underline} (Smith 2012: 92-3)
Tracing this trade back to pre-Enlightenment accounts of imperial
voyages, [Smith points towards a further aspect of the
coloniality/modernity pair: the [origins of semiocapitalism in the
**abstraction** and **theft** of knowledge from indigenous]{.mark}
peoples. [The heart]{.mark} [of]{.mark} this trade is the erroneous
**[re-imagining of knowledge as data]{.mark}**, as tradable commodity, a
process that would not be applied to metropolitan populations until the
20th century.]{.underline} Peter Wolfe distinguishes two forms of
colonization: franchise or dependent colonies where a settler minority
depends on the labour of a majority of colonized natives, and settler
colonies, grounded in immigration, who have no economic need for the
indigenous people. The former gives rise to the forms of coloniality to
which Fanon responded; and breed the fear of the oppressed that returns
today in the \'ambient fears\' (Papastergiadis 2012: 19-35) of
\'homeland security\' and immigration paranoia. In the second form,
'Settler colonies were (are) premised on the elimination of the native
societies. The split tensing reflects a determinate feature of settler
colonization. The colonizers come to stay--- invasion is a structure not
an event\' (Wolfe 1999: 2). [In]{.underline} such colonies, notably in
[the Americas]{.underline}, Australia and New Zealand, [[the
colonized]{.mark} are no longer feared. Instead]{.underline}, after the
genocide, [they [become]{.mark} **major [ideological
tokens]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In some cases the colonizers charge
themselves with \'smoothing the pillow of a dying race\' (Stafford and
Williams 2005: 110 ff); in others, as Simpson and Smith argue,
[indigeneity becomes a living link to land always experienced as alien
by those whose ongoing invasion ensures its alienation. In this
protracted attempt to **\'return\'** to **indigenous values**, which
become \'traditional\' only when assaulted by modernity, the
**[processes]{.mark} of environmentalisation [which characterise]{.mark}
capitalist [modernity repeat themselves: land reappraised]{.mark}
wherever it has remained common, once mineral and energy
[sources]{.mark} have been [identified; skills and knowledges]{.mark}
expropriated from the indigenous commons to become commodity
technologies**; even indigenous DNA mined for the biotech industries. In
settler colonialism we should recognize the prototype of (1) the
endocolonisation of the metropolitan commons, (2) the export of integral
waste into the now externalized environment of land at the expense of
(3) populations which are themselves deemed supernumerary to modernity,
external to the operation of capital, and therefore also merely
environments, and (4) the expropriation of common creativity in the new
social media economy.]{.underline}

#### Promotion of indigenous knowledge is merely nostalgia for a state of belonging which neoliberal capitalism makes impossible. This affirms settlers' fantasies about indigenous resistance, assuages guilt, and creates political passivity. 

**Cubitt 14**

**(Sean Cubitt is Professor of Film and Television at Goldsmiths,
University of London, De-colonising Ecomedia, Cultural Politics, 10(3),
pp. 282-283,
[http://research.gold.ac.uk/14137/1/MED_Cubitt_2014.pdf)//](http://research.gold.ac.uk/14137/1/MED_Cubitt_2014.pdf)//TR)**

There is a common self-designation among indigenous peoples, expressed
in Te Reo Maori as tangata whenua, people of the land. A particular
aspect of the as it were [posthumous [cult of indigenous]{.mark}
ecological [knowledge is **nostalgia** for **place**, for]{.mark}
environmental **[belonging]{.mark}**.]{.underline} What is lacking from
this nostalgia, which powers so much North American environmentalism
from Thoreau to Leopold, is an understanding of the process whereby land
becomes environment: how land environs the increasingly economically
defined human domain, only because it has been progressively,
meticulously and methodically excluded from the narrowing field of what
counts for human. It is not only, as Ursula K Heise (2008: 55) has it,
that [w]{.underline}e are no longer dependent on our knowledge of the
local to survive. It is also that [[in the context
of]{.underline}]{.mark} the experience of [[mobility now common in
global capital]{.underline},]{.mark} [from commuters to
migrants]{.underline}, that [[\'the]{.underline}]{.mark}
[environmentalist [call for a reconnection with the local can be
understood as]{.mark} one form of [\"**reterritorialization**,\" an
attempt to realign culture with place\']{.mark}]{.underline} (Heise
2008: 53). [But [this]{.mark} project [is hedged]{.mark} round [with
problems: a]{.mark} green[, self-sustaining lifestyle]{.mark} is [simply
**not an option** for the majority; the local itself is **permeated** by
**global trade**]{.mark} and **traffic**; and [the very means of
**perception** and **imagination** with which we try to reconnect with
our **immediate locality** are shaped by]{.mark} mediated [comparisons
and experiences of **travel**]{.mark}.]{.underline} It [is in these
circumstances that the [nostalgia for **place** becomes]{.mark} a
[nostalgia for **indigeniety**]{.mark}, an indigeneity [which]{.mark}
not only have [we Westerners **never experienced**,]{.mark} but [which
is]{.mark} in any case [a **Western imaginary**]{.mark}. [The
**ethnographic** attempt to arrive at the **truth** of indigenous
culture]{.mark} is **[only a way of structuring indigenous experience as
Western knowledge.]{.mark}**]{.underline} To understand this gap, it
suffices to [contrast the easily consumed indigeneity]{.underline}
imagined [in]{.underline} James Cameron\'s **[Avatar]{.underline}**
(2009) with the difficulty presented to Western audiences by Zacharias
Kunuk\'s Atanarjuat (2001). Comparing the paternalism and sexual fantasy
of Cameron\'s film [with armed Maoist defense of tribal peoples in
**Orissa**]{.underline} at the time of its release, Slavoj Zizek asks So
where is Cameron\'s film here? Nowhere: [in Orissa, there are no noble
princesses waiting for **white heroes** to seduce them and help their
people, just the Maoists organising the starving farmers]{.underline}.
[The film enables]{.underline} us to practise [a typical ideological
division: **sympathising** with the idealised aborigines while
**rejecting** their **actual struggle**]{.underline}. [The same
people]{.underline} who enjoy the film and admire its aboriginal rebels
[would]{.underline} in all probability [**turn away in horror** from the
Naxalites, dismissing them as murderous terrorists]{.underline} (Zizek
2010). [[\'What lurks behind the **compassion** for the poor is their
**vampiric exploitation\'**]{.mark},]{.underline} Zizek adds. By
contrast, consider the comments of a Boston Globe reviewer of
Atanarjuat: these are not so much real men and women as they are symbols
of ancient myth and lore. In this sense, The Fast Runner might have been
just as effective as a pure documentary, rather than as a narrative
bolstered by its documentary style. The characters are often
indistinguishable from one another, psychologically and physically
(cited in Bessire 2003) The lack of interest in both the mode of telling
and the communitarian ethos of the film escapes the reviewer, who
delights elsewhere in the exotic locations and filmic style, in blank
incomprehension of what is at stake in a movie, which for precisely
those qualities, became an international festival success. Avatar\'s
\'vampiric\' orientalism is matched by the failure of Western audiences
to see in Atanarjuat anything but documentary: a Western mode of
knowledge that converts the Other into trade. In the reception of
Atanarjuat, the location stands only as the alien and removed. With
Avatar we encounter instead peculiar phenomenon of **[[\'Avatar
Blues\']{.underline}]{.mark}**, widely reported cases of
[depression]{.underline} among audience members [whose [enjoyment
of]{.mark}]{.underline} the film, and especially of the imaginary planet
[[Pandora and its indigenous]{.mark} inhabitants [was so intense]{.mark}
that [it left them **deeply unsatisfied** with]{.mark} the
**[reality]{.mark}** to which they returned afterwards]{.underline}
(Cubitt 2012). Nonetheless, there is a [residual utopianism]{.underline}
in the attractions of both films[. [We must be wary]{.mark}]{.underline}
both [of [displacing the burden of]{.mark} that [utopia onto the
colonized]{.mark} and endo-colonized]{.underline}, and of [[mistaking
the]{.mark}]{.underline} necessary [[fantasy of a life well-lived for an
immaterial pipe-dream]{.underline}]{.mark}. The media required to
produce and consume these fantasies are immensely material, as are the
energy sources required to build and power them, and those materials are
intensely implicated in the ongoing processes both of
[[coloniality]{.underline}]{.mark} and [[of]{.underline}
[utopianism]{.underline}]{.mark}. The political task of building a new
eco-cosmopolitanism [based on a new form of common wealth]{.underline}
(Verzola 2008) [[needs]{.mark} its [**temporary autonomous zones** of
**utopian fantasy**, including the fantasy of **reterritorialised
locality**]{.mark}]{.underline}[. **[There is]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[however [no innocent way to do this.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

### **[Suffering]{.underline}**

#### Their sloppy adherence to the virtues of morality transforms into an addiction to the image of catastrophe, alleviating the unreality of our situation. For them, suffering becomes more lucrative than oil reserves -- after all, we find ourselves to be much more important than our vehicles. What do we do when we run out of oil reserves? 

**Baudrillard 94** (Jean, hat*e*s kind f*r*iends and jogging, The
Illusion of the End, 1994)

- we need to look at or invoke suffering to reassure ourselves that
  we're smiley and cool

- always need more suffering, eventually we blow ourselves up and
  self-destruct as we run out of other sources of suffering

[We have]{.underline} long [denounced the capitalistic]{.underline},
[economic exploitation of the poverty of the \'other half of the
world\']{.underline} \[\'autre monde\]. [[We must]{.mark} today
[denounce]{.mark} the [moral and sentimental exploitation]{.mark} of
that poverty]{.underline} - [[charity cannibalism being worse than
oppressive violence]{.underline}]{.mark}. [The extraction and
humanitarian reprocessing]{.underline} [of a destitution which has
become the equivalent of oil deposits and gold mines]{.underline}. The
extortion of [[the spectacle]{.mark} of poverty and]{.underline}, at the
same time, [of our charitable condescension]{.underline}: a worldwide
appreciated surplus of fine sentiments and bad conscience. [We
should]{.underline}, in fact, [see this]{.underline} not as the
extraction of raw materials, but [[as a waste-reprocessing
enterprise]{.underline}.]{.mark} [Their destitution and our bad
conscience are]{.underline}, in effect, all part of [the waste-products
of history]{.underline}- [the main thing is to recycle them to produce a
new energy source]{.underline}. [We have]{.underline} here [an
escalation in the psychological balance of terror]{.underline}. World
capitalist oppression is now merely the vehicle and alibi for this
other, much more ferocious, form of moral predation. One might almost
say, contrary to the Marxist analysis, that [[material exploitation
is]{.mark} only there [to extract]{.mark}]{.underline} that [spiritual
raw material that is [the misery of peoples]{.mark}]{.underline}[,
[which serves as psychological nourishment for the rich countries and
media nourishment]{.underline}]{.mark} [for our daily
lives]{.underline}. [The \'Fourth World\']{.underline} (we are no longer
dealing with a \'developing\' Third World) [is]{.underline} once again
[beleaguered]{.underline}, this time [as a catastrophe-bearing
stratum]{.underline}. The West is whitewashed in the reprocessing of the
rest of the world as waste and residue. And [[the white world
repents]{.mark} and seeks absolution]{.underline} - it, too, the
waste-product of its own history. [The South is a natural producer of
raw materials]{.underline}, [the latest of which is
catastrophe]{.underline}. [The]{.underline} [North]{.underline}, for its
part, [specializes in the reprocessing of raw materials]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} hence also in the reprocessing of
[catastrophe]{.underline}. [[Bloodsucking protection]{.underline},
[humanitarian interference]{.underline}]{.mark}, Medecins sans
frontieres, [international solidarity]{.underline}, etc. [[The last
phase of colonialism]{.underline}]{.mark}: [the New Sentimental Order
is]{.underline} merely the latest form of [the New World
Order]{.underline}. [[Other people\'s destitution becomes our adventure
playground]{.underline}]{.mark}. Thus, the humanitarian offensive aimed
at the Kurds - a show of repentance on the part of the Western powers
after allowing Saddam Hussein to crush them - is in reality merely the
second phase of the war, a phase in which [charitable intervention
finishes off the work of extermination]{.underline}. [[We are the
consumers of the ever delightful spectacle of]{.mark} poverty and
[catastrophe]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [and]{.underline}]{.mark} [of
[the]{.mark} moving [spectacle of our own efforts to alleviate
it]{.mark}]{.underline} ([[which]{.underline}]{.mark}, in fact, merely
[function to [secure the conditions of reproduction of the catastrophe
market]{.mark}]{.underline}); [there]{.underline}, at least, [in the
order of moral profits]{.underline}, the Marxist analysis is wholly
applicable: [we see to it that extreme poverty is reproduced as a
symbolic deposit]{.underline}, as a [fuel essential to]{.underline} the
moral and [sentimental equilibrium]{.underline} of the West. In our
defence, it might be said that this [extreme poverty was]{.underline}
largely of [our own making and it is therefore normal that we should
profit by it]{.underline}. There can be no finer proof that the distress
of the rest of the world is at the root of Western power and that the
spectacle of that distress is its crowning glory than the inauguration,
on the roof of the Arche de la Defense, with a sumptuous buffet laid on
by the Fondation des Droits de l\'homme, of an exhibition of the finest
photos of world poverty. Should we be surprised that spaces are set
aside in the Arche d\' Alliance. for universal suffering hallowed by
caviar and champagne? Just as [the economic crisis of the West will not
be complete so long as it can still exploit the resources of the rest of
the world]{.underline}, so [the symbolic crisis will be complete only
when it is no longer able to feed on the other half\'s human and natural
catastrophes]{.underline} (Eastern Europe, the Gulf, the Kurds,
Bangladesh, etc.). [We need this drug]{.underline}, [which serves us as
an aphrodisiac and hallucinogen]{.underline}. And [the poor countries
are the best suppliers]{.underline} - as, indeed, [they are of other
drugs]{.underline}. [We provide them]{.underline}, [through our
media]{.underline}, with the means to exploit this paradoxical resource,
just as [we give them the means to exhaust their natural resources with
our technologies]{.underline}. [[Our whole culture lives off this
catastrophic cannibalism]{.underline}]{.mark}, [relayed in cynical mode
by the news media]{.underline}, and [carried forward in moral mode by
our humanitarian aid]{.underline}, which is a way of encouraging it and
ensuring its continuity, [just as economic aid is a strategy for
perpetuating under-development]{.underline}. Up to now, [the financial
sacrifice has been compensated a hundredfold by the moral
gain]{.underline}. [[But when the catastrophe market]{.mark} itself
[reaches crisis point]{.mark}]{.underline}, in accordance with the
implacable logic of the market, [when distress becomes
scarce]{.underline} or the marginal returns on it fall from
overexploitation, [when we run out of disasters from elsewhere or when
they can no longer be traded like coffee or other
commodities]{.underline}, [the [West will be forced to produce its own
catastrophe for itself]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} [in order [to meet
its need]{.mark} for spectacle]{.underline} and [that voracious appetite
for symbols which characterizes it even more than its voracious appetite
for food]{.underline}. [It will reach the point where it devours
itself]{.underline}. [When we have finished sucking out the destiny of
others]{.underline}, [we shall have to invent one for
ourselves]{.underline}. [The Great Crash]{.underline}, the symbolic
crash, [will come in the end from us Westerners]{.underline}, but only
when [we are no longer able to feed on the hallucinogenic
misery]{.underline} which comes to us [from]{.underline} [the other half
of the world]{.underline}. Yet they do not seem keen to give up their
monopoly. The Middle East, Bangladesh, black Africa and Latin America
are really going flat out in the distress and catastrophe stakes, and
thus in providing symbolic nourishment for the rich world. They might be
said to be overdoing it: heaping earthquakes, floods, famines and
ecological disasters one upon another, and finding the means to massacre
each other most of the time. [The \'disaster show\' goes on without any
let-up and our sacrificial debt to them far exceeds their economic
debt]{.underline}. The misery with which they generously overwhelm us is
something we shall never be able to repay. The sacrifices we offer in
return are laughable (a tornado or two, a few tiny holocausts on the
roads, the odd financial sacrifice) and, moreover, by some infernal
logic, these work out as much greater gains for us, whereas [our
kindnesses]{.underline} [have merely added to the natural catastrophes
another one immeasurably worse]{.underline}: the demographic
catastrophe, a veritable epidemic which we deplore each day in pictures.
In short, [there is such distortion]{.underline} between North and
South, [to the symbolic advantage of the South]{.underline} (a hundred
thousand Iraqi dead against casualties numbered in tens on our side: in
every case we are the losers), [that [one day everything will break
down]{.mark}]{.underline}. One day, [the West will break down [if we are
not soon washed clean of this shame]{.mark}]{.underline}, [if an
international congress of the poor countries does not very quickly
decide to share out this symbolic privilege of misery and
catastrophe]{.underline}. [It is]{.underline} of course
[normal]{.underline}, **[since we refuse to allow the spread of nuclear
weapons]{.underline},** [that **they should refuse to allow the spread
of the catastrophe weapon**]{.underline}. But it is not right that they
should exert that monopoly indefinitely. In any case, the
under-developed are only so by comparison with the Western system and
its presumed success. In the light of its assumed failure, they are not
under-developed at all. They are only so in terms of a dominant
evolutionism which has always been the worst of colonial ideologies. The
argument here is that there is a line of objective progress and everyone
is supposed to pass through its various stages (we find the same eyewash
with regard to the evolution of species and in that evolutionism which
unilaterally sanctions the superiority of the human race). In the light
of current upheavals, which put an end to any idea of history as a
linear process, there are no longer either developed or under-developed
peoples. Thus, to encourage hope of evolution - albeit by revolution -
among the poor and to doom them, in keeping with the objective illusion
of progress, to technological salvation is a criminal absurdity. In
actual fact, it is their good fortune to be able to escape from
evolution just at the point when we no longer know where it is leading.
In any case, a majority of these peoples, including those of Eastern
Europe, do not seem keen to enter this evolutionist modernity, and their
weight in the balance is certainly no small factor in the West\'s
repudiation of its own history, of its own utopias and its own
modernity. It might be said that the routes of violence, historical or
otherwise, are being turned around and that the viruses now pass from
South to North, there being every chance that, five hundred years after
America was conquered, 1992 and the end of the century will mark the
comeback of the defeated and the sudden reversal of that modernity. The
sense of pride is no longer on the side of wealth but of poverty, of
those who - fortunately for them - have nothing to repent, and may
indeed glory in being privileged in terms of catastrophes. Admittedly,
this is a privilege they could hardly renounce, even if they wished to,
but natural disasters merely reinforce the sense of guilt felt towards
them by the wealthy -- by those whom God visibly scorns since he no
longer even strikes them down. One [day it will be the Whites themselves
who will give up their whiteness]{.underline}. It is a good bet that
repentance will reach its highest pitch with the five-hundredth
anniversary of the conquest of the Americas. [We are going to have to
lift the curse of the defeated]{.underline} - but symbolically
victorious - [peoples]{.underline}, which is insinuating itself five
hundred years later, by way of repentance[, into the heart of the white
race]{.underline}. No solution has been found to the dramatic situation
of the under-developed, and none will be found since their drama has now
been overtaken by that of the overdeveloped, of the rich nations. [The
psychodrama of congestion, saturation, super abundance, neurosis and the
breaking of blood vessels which haunts us]{.underline} - the drama of
the excess of means over ends -- [calls more urgently for attention than
that of penury]{.underline}, [lack]{.underline} [and
poverty]{.underline}. [That]{.underline} [is where the most imminent
danger of catastrophe resides]{.underline}, in the societies which have
run out of emptiness. [Artificial catastrophes]{.underline}, like the
beneficial aspects of civilization, [progress much more quickly than
natural ones]{.underline}. The underdeveloped are still at the primary
stage of the natural, unforeseeable catastrophe. We are already at the
second stage, that of [the manufactured catastrophe]{.underline} -
[imminent and foreseeable]{.underline} - and [[we shall soon be at that
of the pre-programmed catastrophe]{.mark},]{.underline} [the catastrophe
of the third kind]{.underline}, [deliberate and
experimental]{.underline}. [And]{.underline}, paradoxically, [[it is our
pursuit of the means for averting natural
catastrophe]{.underline}]{.mark} - the unpredictable form of destiny -
[[which will take us there]{.underline}]{.mark}. Because [it is unable
to escape it]{.underline}, [[humanity will]{.mark} pretend to be the
author of its destiny]{.underline}. Because it cannot accept being
confronted with an end which is uncertain or governed by fate, [it will
[prefer to stage its own death as a species]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### Their desperate appeal to your morality arises from the dreadful lack of reality they are suddenly experiencing -- faced with such a terrifying prospect, they can only follow the blood, begging you to do the same. You should step back and ask -- why *blood*?

[[Our reality]{.underline}]{.mark}: that is the problem. [We have only
one, and it [has to be saved]{.mark}]{.underline}. \`**[We have to do
something. [We can\'t do nothing]{.mark}.]{.underline}**\' But [doing
something solely because you can\'t not do something has never
constituted a principle of action or freedom]{.underline}.
[Just]{.underline} a form of [absolution from one\'s own
impotence]{.underline} and compassion for one\'s own fate. The people of
Sarajevo do not have to face this question. Where they are, there is an
absolute need to do what they do, to do what has to be done. [[Without
illusion as to ends]{.mark} and without compassion towards themselves.
[That is what being real means]{.mark}]{.underline}, being in the real.
[And [this is not]{.mark} at all [the \`objective\' reality of their
misfortune]{.mark}, that reality which \`ought not to exist\' and for
which we feel pity, but the reality which exists as it is]{.underline}
\-- the reality of an action and a destiny**[. [This is why they are
alive, and we are]{.mark} the ones who are [dead]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
This is why, in our own eyes[, [we have]{.mark}]{.underline} first and
foremost [[to save the reality of the war and impose]{.mark}
that]{.underline} \-- [compassionate]{.underline} \-- [[reality on those
who are suffering]{.mark} from it]{.underline} but who, at the very
heart of war and distress, do not really believe in it. To judge by
their own statements, the Bosnians do not really believe in the distress
which surrounds them. In the end, they find the whole unreal situation
senseless, unintelligible. It is a hell, but an almost hyperreal hell,
made the more hyperreal by media and humanitarian harassment, since that
makes the attitude of the whole world towards them all the more
incomprehensible. Thus, they live in a kind of spectrality of war \--
and it is a good thing they do, or they could never bear it. [But we
know better than they do what reality is]{.underline}, because we have
chosen them to embody it. Or simply [because it is what we \-- and the
whole of the West \-- most lack**. [We have to go and retrieve a reality
for ourselves where the bleeding is]{.mark}**]{.underline}[. [All these
\`corridors\']{.underline}]{.mark} [we open up]{.underline} to send them
our supplies and our \`culture\' [are, in reality, corridors [of
distress through which we import their]{.mark} force and the energy of
their [misfortune]{.mark}]{.underline}. Unequal exchange once again.
Whereas they find a kind of additional strength in the thorough
stripping-away of the illusions of reality and of our political
principles \-- the strength to survive what has no meaning \-- [we go to
convince them of the \`reality\' of their suffering \--
[by]{.mark}]{.underline} culturalizing it, of course, by
[[theatricalizing it]{.underline}]{.mark} so that it can serve as a
point of reference in the theatre of Western values, one of which is
solidarity. This all exemplifies a situation which has now become
general, in which [inoffensive and [impotent intellectuals exchange
their woes]{.mark} for those of the wretched]{.underline}, each
supporting the other in a kind of perverse contract \-- exactly as the
political class and civil society exchange their respective woes today,
the one serving up its corruption and scandals, the other its artificial
convulsions and inertia. Thus we saw Bourdieu and the Abbé Pierre
offering themselves up in televisual sacrifice, exchanging between them
the pathos-laden language and sociological metalanguage of wretchedness.
And so, also, [our whole society is embarking on the path of
commiseration in the literal sense, under cover of ecumenical
pathos]{.underline}. It is almost as though, [in a moment of intense
repentance among intellectuals and politicians]{.underline}, related to
the panic-stricken state of history and the twilight of values, **[[we
had to replenish the stocks of values]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the
referential reserves, by appealing to that lowest common denominator
that is human misery, as though [we had to restock the hunting grounds
[with]{.mark} artificial game. A victim society]{.underline}. I suppose
all it is doing is expressing its own disappointment and remorse at the
impossibility of perpetrating violence upon itself. The New Intellectual
Order everywhere follows the paths opened up by the New World Order.
[The [misfortune, wretchedness and suffering of others]{.mark} have
every\-- where become]{.underline} the [raw material]{.underline} and
the primal scene. Victimhood, accompanied by Human Rights as its sole
funerary ideology. Those who do not exploit it directly and in their own
name do so by proxy. There is no lack of middlemen, who take their
financial or symbolic cut in the process[. Deficit and misfortune, like
the international debt, are traded and sold on in the speculative
market]{.underline} \-- [in this **case [the politico- intellectual
market]{.mark}, which is quite [the equal of the]{.mark}**]{.underline}
late, unlamented **[[military\--industrial
complex]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Now, all commiseration is part of the
logic of misfortune \[malheur[\]. To refer to misfortune, if only to
combat it, is to give it a base]{.underline} for its objective repro\--
duction in perpetuity. [[When fighting anything]{.mark} whatever, [we
have to start]{.mark} out]{.underline} \-- fully aware of what we are
doing \-- [[from evil]{.underline}]{.mark}, never from misfortune.

Building upon the cultural theory of Marcel Mauss and Georges Bataille,
Baudrillard characterises **[symbolic exchange]{.underline}** as a
poetic and necessitous cycle in social relations that is most evident in
non-modern and non-capitalist societies. This form of exchange **[is
prior to and at odds with the logic of scarcity]{.underline}**,
production and surplus value **[in capitalism]{.underline}**: '[The
symbolic social relation is the uninterrupted cycle of giving and
receiving]{.underline}, which, in primitive exchange, includes the
consumption of the "surplus" and deliberate anti-production' -- [the
destruction of material goods]{.underline}; the potlatch is the most
famous example -- when production introduces imbalances that are
untenable in the terms of symbolic exchange.38 From this platform,
Baudrillard launches his foundational critique of both capitalism and
Marxism as 'historical products'39 that disrupt symbolic exchange. With
symbolic exchange serving as both a model of reciprocal social relations
and a foil for Baudrillard's critique of global capitalism, [the
distorted forms of exchange that arise in global politics]{.underline}
-- including those arising **[between would-be rescuers and
victims]{.underline}** -- [attract]{.underline} some of his most [biting
criticism]{.underline}. In 1994 Baudrillard commented on Susan Sontag's
staging of a Bosnian version of Waiting for Godot during the 1993 siege
of Sarajevo -- [her [effort to 'to pitch in and do
something']{.mark}]{.underline}.40 In his critique of this and related
'cultural soul-boosting',41 Baudrillard provides an analysis of a
circulation of signs and values in global politics between would-be
rescuers and victims that [[is]{.underline}]{.mark}, for him,
[[indicative of a corrupt]{.mark} politico-[moral
register]{.mark}]{.underline}. Baudrillard argues that [[the
impulse]{.mark} of would-be rescuers to do something rather than to
stand by [reveals a distorted form of]{.mark} symbolic moral [exchange
in which the privileged seek to 'replenish the pond of
values]{.mark}]{.underline}, the pond of references, and to do so [[by
using]{.underline}]{.mark} that smallest common denominator which is
[[the suffering of the world']{.underline}]{.mark}.42 Baudrillard's
analysis challenges the presumed moral agency of the figure of the
humanitarian and confounds the notion of an unruly conflict-ridden world
'out there' that is separated from a privileged and neutral 'home base'.
[By analysing moral sentiments in terms of a moral economy of distorted
symbolic exchange]{.underline} that resonates with global supply chains
in a parallel global economy, [Baudrillard turns the tables]{.underline}
in the symbolic realm **[to render those in distress as powerful agents
facing the raw reality of their circumstance]{.underline}**, while the
privileged humanitarian gains ethical standing and meaning by coming to
the rescue. '[[They are strong. It is us who are weak and who go]{.mark}
there]{.underline} \[and become rescuers\] to make good for our loss of
strength and sense of reality'.43 Baudrillard argues that [the
privileged, by coming [to the rescue]{.mark} in situations of suffering,
consume the suffering of others in the symbolic realm]{.underline} in
yet another unequal exchange -- one that mirrors, underscores and adds
insult to the structural iniquities of global politics. [The dynamics of
moral exchange between the figures of would-be rescuer and victim are
illustrated by]{.underline} Sherene Razack's44 analysis of popular media
surrounding [Canadian engagement with the Rwandan genocide]{.underline}.
By examining the production and dissemination of images and stories,
Razack shows how [[Canadians]{.mark} have engaged in a peculiar process
of [consum]{.mark}ing the [horror and suffering of]{.mark} Rwanda and
[Rwandans]{.mark}]{.underline}. **[This process [feeds Canadian identity
while effacing Rwandans themselves]{.mark}.]{.underline}**45 For Razack,
[[the consumption]{.mark} of others' suffering in the production of
one's own humaneness [is]{.mark} [possible because
of]{.mark}]{.underline} -- as she shows by drawing upon Saidiya
Hartman's examination of slavery and self-making -- **[[the
'slipperiness of empathy]{.underline}]{.mark}**'.46 By getting close to
the suffering of others, [one makes such suffering one's
own]{.underline}, and thereby risks coming to exist in the place of the
other in ways that obscure him/ her while conferring pleasure and moral
authority on one's self.47 Razack shows how, through various cultural
productions and particularly the prize-winning documentary Shake Hands
with the Devil based on General Romeo Dallaire's book of the same name,
'[[we]{.underline}]{.mark} Canadians [com[e to experience ourselves
as]{.mark} national, as citizens, and indeed as
[human']{.mark}]{.underline}.48 She analyses Shake Hands and its
reception, showing how it positions Canadians as compassionate and
uninvolved observers through identification with Dallaire. In this
process, Canadian audiences gain through their capacity for
vulnerability in the face of depravity. Rwandans, meanwhile, remain
under-specified, an 'anonymous corporeality'.49 The effect is that 'the
[[suffering]{.underline}]{.mark} of the Rwandans [[has been transformed
into our pleasure]{.mark}, the good feeling that we get from
contemplating our own humanity']{.underline}.50 Canadians are invited to
identify with Dallaire. Indeed, there is 'an interactive learning module
for senior highschool and university students which invites students to
be Dallaire'.51 Hereby, Canadians are offered the opportunity to
understand themselves as simultaneously Canadian citizens and
humanitarian participants on the world scene. It is impossible to
ascertain -- at least within the bounds of this article -- whether
individual R2P advocates participate in the economy of symbolic moral
exchange that Razack maps. Nonetheless, the fusing of sentiment and the
demand for prevention and protection within R2P advocacy is necessarily
supported and fuelled by the circulations of similar signs, images and
values in the affective exchange that is analysed by Razack. This is
especially so in **[[situations of imminent atrocity]{.mark} that
[establish powerful channels for]{.mark} getting the 'blood to
flow']{.underline}**;52 **[for trading in the [signs]{.mark}, images and
values [of suffering and compassion]{.mark}]{.underline}**. To advocate
intervention in these situations is more compelling than other options
when set against imminent danger and the challenge of the
intervener--bystander dilemma. [Doing so [connects moral and military
authority through subjectivity]{.mark}, bringing state capacity,
military power and humanitarian authority into relief against the
suffering of deeply disempowered and disenfranchised
people]{.underline}. The striking differences between these worlds are
deeply seductive within the symbolic economy of humanitarianism in a
highly unequal globalised world. Regardless of the extent to which
individual R2P advocates participate in the symbolic moral economy of
humanitarianism, [R2P advocacy]{.underline} relies upon and [is
entangled with this distorted form of exchange between the figures of
would-be rescuers and victims, particularly through the humanitarian
foundations upon which it depends]{.underline}. The concrete correlates
include, as Orford notes, overlooking 'the agency of the peoples of the
states where intervention is to be conducted',53 including their
understandings of political life and the shape of their aspirations for
political community. As Luck and Luck point out, '\[t\]oo often,
**[[distant]{.mark} analysts and [policymakers, fueled by rescue
fantasies]{.mark}, have [cast the vulnerable as]{.mark} little more than
[passive victims, with no options and no part in]{.mark} prevention and
[protection]{.mark}]{.underline}**[']{.mark}.54 R2P is thus suffused, as
Frédéric Mégret argues, with a vision of international rescue which
neglects the key role of individuals, civil society and resistance
movements, including through the 'power and resilience' of would-be
victims to protect themselves.55 These dynamics risk a situation wherein
[the]{.underline} forms of life, and especially [ways of being and
political ordering of the privileged humanitarian, are cast as superior
to]{.underline} and thus come to stand in for and to disavow those of
[suffering others]{.underline}. To not challenge this situation and yet
to support R2P is to participate in the troubled symbolic economy of
humanitarianism and contemporary international architecture, thereby
compounding rather than addressing underlying humanitarian problems of
contemporary global politics. The foregoing critical analysis follows a
harsh Baudrillardian logic to show that R2P advocacy relies upon a
distorted and problematic form of symbolic moral exchange between
would-be rescuers and victims in the affective relations of contemporary
global politics. [The [moral common sense]{.mark}]{.underline} that
underpins R2P **[[cannot go unchallenged]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the
light of this critique. However, attending to the symbolic moral
politics of humanitarianism through a Baudrillardian analysis also
offers a framework for rethinking relations between the figures of
would-be rescuers and victims in R2P, and for advancing R2P. [Symbolic
exchange is]{.underline} the foundation for Baudrillardian critique but
it is also [a crucial social relation of giving and receiving that
connects people in powerful ways]{.underline}. A Baudrillardian critique
therefore does not set out to disavow the germ of intersubjective
commitment, whether of Canadian high school students engaging with the
Rwandan genocide, or of R2P advocates. Instead, [symbolic exchange can
help to connect subjectivity and personal morality with the politics of
the international order while reconfiguring R2P moral common sense and
providing ways of advancing R2P by engaging individually and
'locally'.]{.underline}

#### They transform morality into compulsory repetition manufactured by the system, a kind of call-and-response which instills a withering microfascism at the heart of our subjectivities. This self-tyranny is comparatively the worst form of violence.

[At all events, [it is better to be controlled by someone else than by
oneself]{.mark}]{.underline}. Better to be oppressed, exploited,
persecuted and manipulated by someone other than oneself. In this sense
[the entire movement for [liberation]{.mark}]{.underline} and
emancipation, inasmuch as it [[is predicated]{.underline}]{.mark} on a
demand for greater autonomy -- or, in other words, **[[on]{.mark} a more
[complete introjection of]{.mark} all forms of [control]{.mark} and
constraint under the banner of freedom]{.underline}** -- is a
regression. Whatever it may be that comes to us from elsewhere, even the
worst exploitation, the very fact that it comes from elsewhere is
positive. This is why alienation has its advantages, even though it is
so often denounced as the dispossession of the self, with the other
treated in consequence as an age-old enemy holding the alienated part of
us captive. The inverse theory, that of disalienation, is equally
simplistic, holding as it does that the subject merely has to
reappropriate his alienated will and his alienated desire. From this
perspective everything that befalls the subject as a result of his own
efforts is good, because it is authentic; while everything that comes
from outside the subject is dubbed inauthentic, merely because it does
not fall within the sphere of his freedom. Exactly the opposite position
is the one that has to be stressed, while at the same time broadening
the paradox. For just as [it is better to be controlled by someone else
rather than by oneself, it is likewise always better to be made happy,
or unhappy, by someone else rather than by oneself]{.underline}. [[It is
always better to depend in life on something that does not depend on
us]{.mark}. In this way I can avoid any kind of servitude, I am not
obliged to submit to something that does not depend on me -- including
my own existence.]{.underline} I am free of my birth -- and in the same
sense I can be free of my death. **[[There has never been any true
freedom apart from this one]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The source of all
interplay, of everything that is in play, of all passion, of all
seduction, is that which is completely foreign to us, yet has power over
us. That which is Other, that which we have to seduce.

#### The aff is complicit in [charity cannibalism]{.underline} - the [sentimental exploitation of suffering]{.underline} which is [worse than the violence itself]{.underline}. It ensures the [spectacle of crisis]{.underline} must escalate.

**Baudrillard, 94** \[Jean Baudrillard, detestable and ingenious, "The
Illusion of the End," 1994, Polity Press\]

**[[The end of history]{.underline}]{.mark}**, being itself a
catastrophe, [**[can only be fuelled by
catastrophe]{.underline}**.]{.mark} [Managing the end]{.underline}
therefore [becomes]{.underline} **[synonymous with the management of
catastrophe]{.underline}**. And, quite specifically, of that catastrophe
[which is]{.underline} **[the slow extermination]{.underline}** [of the
rest of the world.]{.underline} We have long denounced the capitalistic,
economic exploitation of the poverty of the \'other half of the world\'
\[l\'autre monde\]. **[[We must]{.underline}]{.mark}** today
**[[denounce]{.underline}]{.mark}** the moral and **[[sentimental
exploitation of]{.underline}]{.mark}** that poverty - **[[charity
cannibalism being worse than oppressive violence]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
The extraction and humanitarian reprocessing of a destitution which has
become the equivalent of oil deposits and gold mines. [The extortion of
the spectacle of]{.underline} poverty and, at the same time, of our
[charitable condescension: a worldwide appreciated surplus of fine
sentiments]{.underline} and bad conscience. [We should]{.underline}, in
fact, [see this]{.underline} not as the extraction of raw materials, but
[as]{.underline} a **[waste-reprocessing enterprise]{.underline}**.
Their destitution and our bad conscience are, in effect, all part of the
waste-products of history - [the main thing is to recycle them to
produce a new energy source.]{.underline} We have here an escalation in
the psychological balance of terror. World capitalist oppression is now
merely the vehicle and alibi for this other, much more ferocious, form
of moral predation. One might almost say, contrary to the Marxist
analysis, that material exploitation is only there to extract that
spiritual raw material that is the **[[misery]{.underline}]{.mark}** of
peoples, which [[serves as]{.underline} **[psychological
nourishment]{.underline}** [for]{.underline}]{.mark} the rich countries
and media nourishment for **[[our daily lives.]{.mark}]{.underline}**
The \'Fourth World\' (we are no longer dealing with a \'developing\'
Third World) is once again beleaguered, this time as a
catastrophe-bearing stratum. [[The West is whitewashed in the
reprocessing of the rest of the world as waste and
residue]{.underline}]{.mark}. And the white world repents and seeks
absolution - it, too, the wasteproduct of its own history. The South is
a natural producer of raw materials, the latest of which is catastrophe.
[[The]{.mark} [North]{.mark}]{.underline}, for its part, [[specializes
in the reprocessing of raw materials and]{.mark} hence also in the
reprocessing of [catastrophe]{.mark}]{.underline}. Bloodsucking
protection, humanitarian interference, Medecins sans frontieres,
international solidarity, etc. [The **last phase** of
**colonialism**:]{.underline} **[the New Sentimental
Order]{.underline}** is merely the latest form of the New World Order.
[[Other people\'s destitution becomes our **adventure
playground**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Thus, [the humanitarian offensive
aimed at the Kurds]{.underline} - **[a show of repentance]{.underline}**
on the part of the Western powers [after allowing]{.underline} **[Saddam
Hussein to crush them]{.underline}** [- is in]{.underline} reality
[merely the second phase of the war]{.underline}, a phase **[in which
[charitable intervention]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[finishes off]{.mark}
the]{.underline} **[work of [extermination]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. [We
are the consumers of the]{.underline}]{.mark} ever delightful
[[spectacle of]{.underline}]{.mark} poverty and
**[[catastrophe]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [and]{.underline} of [the moving
**spectacle of our own efforts to alleviate** it (which]{.underline}, in
fact, merely **[function to secure the]{.underline}** conditions of
reproduction of the **[catastrophe market]{.underline}**); there, at
least, in the order of moral profits, the Marxist analysis is wholly
applicable: we see to it that extreme poverty is reproduced as a
symbolic deposit, as a fuel essential to the moral and sentimental
equilibrium of the West. In our defence, it might be said that this
extreme poverty was largely of our own making and it is therefore normal
that we should profit by it. There can be no finer proof that the
distress of the rest of the world is at the root of Western power and
that the spectacle of that distress is its crowning glory than the
inauguration, on the roof of the Arche de la Defense, with a sumptuous
buffet laid on by the Fondation des Droits de l\'homme, of an exhibition
of the finest photos of world poverty. Should we be surprised that
spaces are set aside in the Arche d\'Alliance\* for universal suffering
hallowed by caviar and champagne? Just as the economic crisis of the
West will not be complete so long as it can still exploit the resources
of the rest of the world, so the symbolic crisis will be complete only
when it is no longer able to feed on the other half\'s human and natural
catastrophes (Eastern Europe, the Gulf, the Kurds, Bangladesh, etc.).
**[[We need this drug]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which serves us as an
aphrodisiac and hallucinogen. And the poor countries are the best
suppliers - as, indeed, they are of other drugs. We provide them,
through our media, with the means to exploit this paradoxical resource,
[just as we give them the means to]{.underline} **[exhaust their natural
resources with our technologies]{.underline}**. [Our whole culture lives
off this **catastrophic cannibalism**]{.underline}, relayed in cynical
mode by the news media, [and carried forward in moral mode by our
humanitarian aid, which is a way of encouraging it and ensuring its
continuity, **just as economic aid is a strategy for perpetuating
under-development**]{.underline}. Up to now, the **[financial sacrifice
has been compensated a hundredfold by the moral gain]{.underline}**; But
when the catastrophe market itself reaches crisis point, in accordance
with the implacable logic of the market, when distress becomes scarce or
the marginal returns on it fall from overexploitation, when we run out
of disasters from elsewhere or when they can no longer be traded like
coffee or other commodities, [[the West will be forced to produce its
own catastrophe for itself]{.underline}]{.mark}, in order to meet its
need for spectacle and that voracious appetite for symbols which
characterizes it even more than its voracious appetite for food. It will
reach the point where it devours itself. When we have finished sucking
out the destiny of others, we shall have to invent one for ourselves.
[The Great Crash]{.underline}, the symbolic crash, [will come in the end
from us Westerners]{.underline}, but only when we are no longer able to
feed on the hallucinogenic misery which comes to us from the other half
of the world. Yet they do not seem keen to give up their monopoly. The
Middle East, Bangladesh, black Africa and Latin America are really going
flat out in the distress and catastrophe stakes, and thus in providing
symbolic nourishment for the rich world. They might be said to be
overdoing it: heaping earthquakes, floods, famines and ecological
disasters one upon another, and finding the means to massacre each other
most of the time. The \'disaster show\' goes on without any let-up and
our sacrificial debt to them far exceeds their economic debt. The misery
with which they generously overwhelm us is something we shall never be
able to repay. The sacrifices we offer in return are laughable (a
tornado or two, a few tiny holocausts on the roads, the odd financial
sacrifice) and, moreover, by some infernal logic, these work out as much
greater gains for us, whereas [**[our kindnesses]{.underline}**
[have]{.underline}]{.mark} [merely [added to the]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[natural catastrophes]{.underline}**]{.mark} another one immeasurably
worse: the demographic catastrophe, a veritable epidemic which we
deplore each day in pictures. In short, there is such distortion between
North and South, to the symbolic advantage of the South (a hundred
thousand Iraqi dead against casualties numbered in tens on our side: in
every case we are the losers), that one day everything will break down.
One day, **[the West will break down if we are not soon washed clean of
this shame]{.underline}**, if an international congress of the poor
countries does not very quickly decide to share out this symbolic
privilege of misery and catastrophe. It is of course normal, since we
refuse to allow the spread of nuclear weapons, that they should refuse
to allow the spread of the catastrophe weapon. But it is not right that
they should exert that monopoly indefinitely. In any case, [the
under-developed are only so by comparison with the Western system and
its presumed success]{.underline}. **[In the light of its assumed
failure, they are not under-developed at all.]{.underline}** They are
only so in terms of a dominant **[evolutionism]{.underline}** which
[has]{.underline} always [been the worst]{.underline} **[of colonial
ideologies]{.underline}**. The argument here is that there is a line of
objective progress and everyone is supposed to pass through its various
stages (we find the same eyewash with regard to the evolution of species
and in that evolutionism which unilaterally sanctions the superiority of
the human race). In the light of current upheavals, which put an end to
any idea of history as a linear process, there are no longer either
developed or under-developed peoples. Thus, [to encourage]{.underline}
hope of **[evolution]{.underline}** - albeit by revolution - among the
poor and to doom them, in keeping [with]{.underline} the objective
illusion of progress, to **[[technological salvation is a criminal
absurdity]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In actual fact, it is their good
fortune to be able to escape from evolution just at the point when we no
longer know where it is leading. In any case, a majority of these
peoples, including those of Eastern Europe, do not seem keen to enter
this evolutionist modernity, and their weight in the balance is
certainly no small factor in the West\'s repudiation of its own history,
of its own utopias and its own modernity. It might be said that the
routes of violence, historical or otherwise, are ·being turned around
and that the viruses now pass from South to North, there being every
chance that, five hundred years after America was conquered, 1992 and
the end of the century will mark the comeback of the defeated and the
sudden reversal of that modernity. The sense of pride is no longer on
the side of wealth but of poverty, of those who - fortunately for them -
have nothing to repent, and may indeed glory in being privileged in
terms of catastrophes. Admittedly, this is a privilege they could hardly
renounce, even if they wished to, but natural disasters merely reinforce
the sense of guilt felt towards them by the wealthy - by those whom God
visibly scorns since he no longer even strikes them down. One day it
will be the Whites themselves who will give up their whiteness. It is a
good bet that repentance will reach its highest pitch with the
five-hundredth anniversary of the conquest of the Americas. We are going
to have to lift the curse of the defeated - but symbolically
victorious - peoples, which is insinuating itself five hundred years
later, by way of repentance, into the heart of the white race. No
solution has been found to the dramatic situation of the
under-developed, and none will be found since their drama has now been
overtaken by that of the overdeveloped, of the rich nations. **[The
psychodrama]{.underline}** of congestion, saturation, superabundance,
neurosis and the breaking of blood vessels which [haunts
us]{.underline} - the drama of the excess of means over ends - calls
more urgently for attention than that of penury, lack and poverty.
**[That is where the most imminent danger of catastrophe resides, in the
societies which have run out of emptiness. Artificial
catastrophes]{.underline}**, like the beneficial aspects of
civilization, [progress much more quickly than natural
ones]{.underline}. The underdeveloped are still at the primary stage of
the natural, unforeseeable catastrophe. [[We are]{.underline}]{.mark}
already [[at the]{.underline}]{.mark} second stage, that of the
**[[manufactured catastrophe]{.underline}]{.mark}** - imminent and
foreseeable - [[and]{.mark} we shall [soon]{.mark} be at that of
the]{.underline} **[[pre-programmed catastrophe]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
the catastrophe of the third kind, **[[deliberate and
experimental]{.underline}]{.mark}**. And, paradoxically, it is our
pursuit of the means for averting natural catastrophe - the
unpredictable form of destiny - which will take us there. Because it is
unable to escape it, [**[humanity]{.mark}** will pretend to be the
author of its destiny. Because it **[cannot accept]{.mark} being
confronted with [an end which is uncertain]{.mark}** or governed by
fate, **[it will prefer to stage its own death as a
species.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

#### Debate cannibalizes images of suffering as fuel for modernity in order to preserve itself. Absent this, the West would collapse out of shame. 

**Baudrillard, 94** \[Jean Baudrillard, detestable and ingenious, "The
Illusion of the End," 1994, Polity Press\]

**[[The end of history]{.underline}]{.mark}**, being itself a
catastrophe, [**[can only be fuelled by
catastrophe]{.underline}**.]{.mark} [Managing the end]{.underline}
therefore [becomes]{.underline} **[synonymous with the management of
catastrophe]{.underline}**. And, quite specifically, of that catastrophe
[which is]{.underline} **[the slow extermination]{.underline}** [of the
rest of the world.]{.underline} We have long denounced the capitalistic,
economic exploitation of the poverty of the \'other half of the world\'
\[l\'autre monde\]. **[[We must]{.underline}]{.mark}** today
**[[denounce]{.underline}]{.mark}** the moral and **[[sentimental
exploitation of]{.underline}]{.mark}** that poverty - **[[charity
cannibalism being worse than oppressive violence]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
The extraction and humanitarian reprocessing of a destitution which has
become the equivalent of oil deposits and gold mines. [The extortion of
the spectacle of]{.underline} poverty and, at the same time, of our
[charitable condescension: a worldwide appreciated surplus of fine
sentiments]{.underline} and bad conscience. [We should]{.underline}, in
fact, [see this]{.underline} not as the extraction of raw materials, but
[as]{.underline} a **[waste-reprocessing enterprise]{.underline}**.
Their destitution and our bad conscience are, in effect, all part of the
waste-products of history - [the main thing is to recycle them to
produce a new energy source.]{.underline} We have here an escalation in
the psychological balance of terror. World capitalist oppression is now
merely the vehicle and alibi for this other, much more ferocious, form
of moral predation. One might almost say, contrary to the Marxist
analysis, that material exploitation is only there to extract that
spiritual raw material that is the **[[misery]{.underline}]{.mark}** of
peoples, which [[serves as]{.underline} **[psychological
nourishment]{.underline}** [for]{.underline}]{.mark} the rich countries
and media nourishment for **[[our daily lives.]{.mark}]{.underline}**
The \'Fourth World\' (we are no longer dealing with a \'developing\'
Third World) is once again beleaguered, this time as a
catastrophe-bearing stratum. [[The West is whitewashed in the
reprocessing of the rest of the world as waste and
residue]{.underline}]{.mark}. And the white world repents and seeks
absolution - it, too, the wasteproduct of its own history. The South is
a natural producer of raw materials, the latest of which is catastrophe.
[[The]{.mark} [North]{.mark}]{.underline}, for its part, [[specializes
in the reprocessing of raw materials and]{.mark} hence also in the
reprocessing of [catastrophe]{.mark}]{.underline}. Bloodsucking
protection, humanitarian interference, Medecins sans frontieres,
international solidarity, etc. [The **last phase** of
**colonialism**:]{.underline} **[the New Sentimental
Order]{.underline}** is merely the latest form of the New World Order.
[[Other people\'s destitution becomes our **adventure
playground**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Thus, [the humanitarian offensive
aimed at the Kurds]{.underline} - **[a show of repentance]{.underline}**
on the part of the Western powers [after allowing]{.underline} **[Saddam

### Switch Side Debate

#### Switch sides exacerbates ideological division while retrenching existing social cleavages. Not only does switching sides not track truth or effectuate any political change -- it depoliticizes social movements, preserving social stability under the appearance of dynamic exchange. 

**Edelman, 92** (Murray Edelman 92, \"The construction and uses of
social problems\" in Jean Baudrillard: The Disappearance of Art and
Politics, pg. 265-7)

[Explanations for the social problems that persist are notable for the
diversity of causes and of ideologies to which they point, not for their
rigor, verifiability, or explanatory power.]{.underline} Explanations
blame social institutions, social classes, those who suffer, or those
who benefit. They may locate the cause of a problem in regional
characteristics, nationality, ethnicity, climate, stage of historical
development, personality, or a combination of several such categories.
They may be concrete or abstract. [They reproduce the typologies
currently fashionable in other news reporting, popular discussion, and
academic writing.]{.underline} Such diversity is as characteristic of
social scientists\' explanations as of popularly accepted ones. In this
form of endeavor the scientific is also the political. **[To evoke a
problem\'s origin is to assign blame and praise]{.underline}**. [Blame
for recurring wars and militarism depends upon whether they are seen as
originating in the plans of aggressors, the authoritarian character
structure of some cultures, the chance occurrence of a sequence of
events with which diplomats cannot cope, the logic implicit in
industrialized societies, or the will of God. Each origin reduces the
issue to a particular perspective and minimizes or eliminates others.
Each reflects an ideology and rationalizes a course of
action.]{.underline} [**[A particular explanation]{.mark} of a
persisting problem [is likely to strike a large]{.mark} part of [the
public as correct]{.mark} for a fairly long period [if it]{.mark}
reflects and [reinforces the dominant ideology]{.mark}**]{.underline} of
that era. [Consider]{.underline} as examples [the contrast in generally
accepted explanations for international tensions in the decades
preceding the Second World War and in those following the war or the
contrast in dominant explanations of economic recession between the
liberal thirties and the conservative eighties. The \"career\" of an
explanation of a problem manifestly hinges in part on the acceptability
of the ideological premise it implies. Because **a social problem is not
a verifiable entity but a construction that furthers ideological
interests, its** **explanation is bound to be part of the process of
construction rather than a set of falsifiable
propositions**]{.underline}. In a crucial sense [problems are created so
that particular reasons can be offered for public acceptance,
and,]{.underline} as I note below, [so that particular remedies can be
proposed. [An explanation]{.mark} for a chronic social problem [can
never be generally supported. It is offered to be rejected as much as to
be accepted. Its function is to intensify polarization and so maintain
the support of advocates on both sides]{.mark}. The reasons offered are
crucial to the self-esteem of concerned people and to the viability of
interested groups, organizations, and causes.]{.underline} [They all
draw support from the evocation of a spectacle that shows their rivals
as threats. **[An explanation for a troubling condition is typically
more important to partisans than the possibility of eliminating the
condition]{.mark}**; the latter is a rhetorical evocation of a remote
future time unlikely to arrive, while the explanation is vital to
contemporary political maneuver]{.underline}. [[Because there are always
conflicting explanations, any affirmation of an origin for a problem is
also an implicit rejection of alternative origins]{.mark}; such an
affirmation is bound to bring to consciousness whatever it
denies.]{.underline} As Derrida notes, the trace of what is negated
remains present and so continues to play a part in action and in
attitudes, its difference from the affirmation actually constructing the
meaning of the affirmation. [To declare that a Russian proposal for
mutual reductions in armaments is only a public relations ploy is to
arouse the suspicion that it may be more than that. **[Oppositions in
expressed \"opinion\" accordingly make for social
stability]{.mark}**]{.underline}**; [they are almost synonymous with it,
for they reaffirm and reify what everyone already knows and
accepts.]{.underline}** To express a pro-choice or an anti-abortion
position is to affirm that the opposite position is being expressed as
well and to accept the opposition as a continuing feature of public
discourse. [**The well-established, thoroughly anticipated, and
therefore ritualistic reaffirmation of the differences institutionalizes
both rhetorics, minimizing the chance of major shifts and leaving the
regime wide discretion, for there will be anticipated support and
opposition no matter what forms of action or inaction occur. As long as
there is substantial expression of opinion on both sides of an issue,
social stability persists and so does regime discretion regardless of
the exact numbers or of marginal shifts in the numbers.** The
persistence of unresolved problems with conflicting meanings is vital.
**It is not the expression of opposition but of consensus that makes for
instability**]{.underline}. When statements need not be defended against
counterstatements, they are readily changed or inverted. Consensual
agreements about the foreign enemy or ally yield readily to acceptance
of the erstwhile enemy as ally and the former ally as enemy, as happened
at the end of World War II; but opinions about abortion are likely to
persist.3 **[[Rebellion and revolution do not ferment in societies in
which there has been a long history of the ritualized exchange of
opposing views on issues accepted as important, but rather where such
exchanges have been lacking, so that a consensus on common action to
oust the regime is easily built]{.underline}]{.mark}**. These
observations seem counterintuitive only when opinion is conceptualized
as growing in the individual mind, which then secretes it into the
public domain[. As soon as \"opinion\" is recognized as an ambiguous
reference to texts, as bits of language that circulate in a culture and
present themselves for acceptance or rejection, it becomes evident that
opposing texts become bulwarks of one another while isolated texts,
unsupported by opposition, are readily vulnerable to new language.
Language about origins]{.underline} is therefore not likely to convert
people from an ideology to a contrary one very often or generate an
opinion that persists in spite of exposure to changing language or new
situations. Its [effect]{.underline}, as already suggested**[, is to
sharpen the issue, sometimes to polarize opinion, and in any case to
clarify the pattern of opinion oppositions available for acceptance. The
construction of problems and of reasons for them accordingly reinforces
conventional social cleavages; those long standing divisions of interest
in which relative power, sanctions, and the limits of the rivalry are
well established and widely recognized. The political result of such
reinforcement is clear]{.underline}** enough. **[[Realignments, new
coalitions, and unconventional forms of political action are excluded
from common discourse and]{.mark} so [become less
likely]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The evocation and reconstruction of
origins are pervasive, constant, and central to political maneuver, [a
linguistically generated process]{.underline} that creates concerned
groups, pits them against one another for varying time periods, and
[gives the political process an appearance of dynamism and tension that
rarely has any bearing upon its outcomes.]{.underline}

### **[Turkey]{.underline}**

#### **Turkey needs to figure out if it tastes like chicken or like pork. This is a prerequisite question.** 

**YUMRUKUZ 14** (ÖZLEM, YILDIZ TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY, "A MEDIA ANALYSIS
IN TURKEY ON THE THEORY OF SIMULATION BY JEAN BAUDRILLARD (2010- 2012)",
31-35, 2014, 'er', graphs got weirdly copied sorry)

5\. **[[TRANSFORMATION OF TURKISH SOCIETY]{.underline}]{.mark}** In the
transition period from modern to postmodern, technology has become one
of the significant factors that contributes to the process by its
various mediums. Like many countries in the world, [Turkish society can
transform from traditional to ‗modern society' as it is liable to resist
to a social structural transformation under the impact of
capitalism.]{.underline} The first reason is that in the process of
transition from conventionality to modernity, the traditional way of
living has been practiced with the premises of modernity and has been
altered substantially. Subsequently, social mobility has been achieved
both vertically and laterally which means that though the mobility
occurs to some extent, structural patterns may remain stable. In other
words, even though there may happen to be a transfer and a prospective
structural change, the behavior patterns of the individuals may not
change in the parallel sense. In other words, [though those migrated to
cities contribute in the production to some extent in urban life, [style
of consumption]{.mark} such as habits, life styles or individual
viewpoint may [continue to exist in the previously]{.mark} experienced
[manner]{.mark}]{.underline}. For instance, a person after becoming rich
and getting a social status in society may persist in one's own
consumption patterns like spending holidays on farm, doing husbandry or
engaging activities performed in previous life rather than experiencing
a holiday type that of a city-dweller's. Above all, as long as a
person's attitude towards life does not change, it becomes nearly
impossible to observe a person behaving in accordance with what a city
life requires in practice. The condition reminds us sociologist William
Ogburn's theory of cultural lag that the solution can be found by way of
the diffusion of innovations.4 The second reason counts as the goal of
westernization since the time of Ottomans which stems from the rustic
nature and origin of Turkish society. By the late of 1980s, most of the
population was living in rural areas and the urban population was low in
number and gradual migration from villages to towns. In the light of
[these presuppositions concerning a geographical shift conversely
realized in behavioral patterns can be linked with the example of
watching TV as a leisure time activity in urban areas]{.underline}. In
spite of such a drift, demand for watching TV can directly be linked
with a demand for entertainment which can also be observed with
considerable rates recorded as seen in Table 5 below. Table 5:
Entertainment Displayed in Private Channels in Turkey, 2011 Number

of Cultural Policy of Society and Media's Effectivity on the Cultural
Processes, SETA, 2011) According to statistical results taken from SETA,
display of entertainment on TV channels is not sufficient in
compensating the need to be entertained indoors. Those who responded as
sufficient has a pleasure of being entertained which means that media
provides an adequate element of amusement and can also be considered as
the originator and server for fun. As for those who responded about its
insufficiency means that they demand more entertainment than what media
releases. Table 6: Entertainment Displayed in TRT Channel, Turkey, 2011

2698 98,9 % Invalid 29 1,1 % TOTAL 2727 100% Research on the Perception
of Cultural Policy of Society and Media's Effectivity on the Cultural
Processes, SETA, 2011) Incidentally, TRT is perceived as a more serious
channel than the others as it is the state channel. For both private
channels and TRT channel it is observed that there is an apetite and
eagerness to be entertained. It is considered to have more embodiment of
entertainment in comparison to private channels (see Table 6). [The
[traditional content]{.mark} through television [is translated into an
object of entertainment that]{.mark} is presented, and [has to be
represented]{.mark} since we are already finished of it]{.underline}. As
an example of it, marriage rituals are seen to be broken off from their
own environment and have begun to be performed anachronically by the
society as part of people's private choices and lives on television
screen where the components of traditionality are thus compressed into
the contemporary and have become like pastiches . As a result, [binaries
and [distinctions]{.mark} seperating high and pop culture [has been
erased in]{.mark} the appreciation of art and culture given new meaning
in [the frame of television's reality]{.mark}. It is subsequently
[reduced to one dimensional level]{.mark} so that a great majority of
people is exposure to nearly the same media content; they listen to the
same music or reach the same commercial products, all of which are
slightly differentiated by commercial value]{.underline}. Particularly,
culture in postmodern society is partly oriented and sustained by media
technologies. Kenneth (2011) gave a clear explanation on how traditional
culture in postmodern world is manipulated by media technologies. First,
he divided culture into two as grounded culture and commodified culture.
The former emerges out of face-to-face interaction and is intended to
create meaning, morality, norms, values and beliefs. As for commodified
culture, it is created according to capitalist and mass media intended
to beguile the viewer to incent buying (306). This connection mostly
results in a generation and decadence of any culture rapidly. We may
call this as the rapid transformation of one culture into another one
parallel with the progress in information and communication
technologies. Postmodern culture has its ties in this new trend of
consumerist behavior which results in the consumption of a culture and
emergence of another. The creation of a consumer society is therefore a
result of technological penetration into our lives. As the abundance of
the copied doubles becomes superficial and devoid of originality,
objects are transformed into kitsch. In addition to that, the creation
of various cultures inevitably occurs as a part of technological
progression. Thus[, a new form of culture in postmodern life is not able
to grow on its own natural way, which is only the continuation of
transformed version of the former]{.underline}. Additionally, twist of
the images forms new social habits and life styles. This perversion of
reality is so insidiously materialized by media that it is relatively
permeative. The end of representation and the beginning of new form of
representation by the media becomes the simulation itself. [An image as
postmodernists argue refers to limitless signifieds that are irrelevant
from each other. Signs take the superiority in determining the
infrastructure of relation construction of groups and
cliques]{.underline}. How people relate meaning to objects and what
these objects mean creating a collective consciousness in the minds of
the people have a potential to transform individual perception thereby
altering the social perspective. In sum, in the postmodern stage of
capitalism Baudrillard dealt with how media created this falsity and
uncertainty. Therefore, **[consumer society]{.underline}** for
Baudrillard **[represents [the condition of culture in postmodern
society]{.mark}]{.underline}** since it has been [[overcome and seized
by images of the hyper-real world]{.mark}]{.underline} in which they
have already lost in essence and on which the dissertation inspiringly
focuses the same supposition **[[in terms of Turkish
society]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The production is ended in the creation
of new forms of culture and older forms are remanufactured rapidly which
means that the traditional way of living has already become problematic.
Mobility in society is not culminated in new behavioral patterns on the
other hand, practices may continue somehow in an altered form. In this
sense, urbanization presents a cosmopolitan space, whereby a common
platform is provided with a convenient atmosphere for those coming from
different nationalities or ethnic groups who live together and endeavor
to get accustomed to the common rules in towns though regional customs
and behavioral patterns gradually have become lost in importance in
material world. Media at this point provides a reserve to the need for
the satisfaction of leisure in urban spaces for those who prefer more of
a domestic life indoors.

#### Turkey isn't real -- we have [empirical data]{.underline}. It's a shame: no more Thanksgiving!

**YUMRUKUZ 14** (ÖZLEM, YILDIZ TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY, "A MEDIA ANALYSIS
IN TURKEY ON THE THEORY OF SIMULATION BY JEAN BAUDRILLARD (2010- 2012)",
102-104, 2014, 'er')

[With respect to [hyperreality, in]{.mark}]{.underline} the study, [an
analysis of]{.underline} contemporary cultural and social condition of
[[Turkey is put to understand]{.mark} the reflection of media's
cultivation of]{.underline} televisual imagery in [[the social
environment]{.underline}]{.mark}. At this point, it is concluded that TV
is shown to be assuring a system of monolog that prevents a response
from the receiver. A great majority of the participants agreed that
media perverts reality to its own interest which seems paradoxical that
they seemed to think as such though they gave their assent to the power
of media. [Its manipulative action]{.underline} adversely
[is]{.underline} [shown to have an effect on traditional way of
living]{.underline}; marriage programmes and Survivor directly represent
the entertainment culture dominating society as a whole. Survivor in the
dissertation is put more emphasis and is the focuse of our main
presuppositions regarding Baudrillard's media theory. The marriage shows
are mentioned as complementary to dissertation's focal point to support
and strengthen the main argument on the potentiality of reality shows in
creating simulations through televisual imagery. The research findings
at this level indicate that the recipients are already entrapped in the
seductive power of entertainment assured at first hand by media samples.
While attempting to substantiate our hypothesis and findings we tried to
focus on media's causes (media preference and exposure), effects (silent
majority) and reflections (hyperreality in simulated models). Thus
**[[our findings strongly suggest that media imagery is substituted for
reality that hides the absence of it]{.underline}]{.mark}** as seen in
the case of marriage and Survivor programmes. Obtained [empirical
results of the study suggest that viewers of a particular media sample
tend to think on common grounds and act in the same way]{.underline}.
The basic motive is to entertain one and ensure relaxation. To expound
our arguments on the problem of reality in the frame of Baudrillard\'s
concept of simulation and hyper-reality, the reality show Survivor is
analyzed to substantiate how reality is merged with unreality and how
the viewing audience is immersed into television imagery. Survivor as a
type of reality programme is a designed and simulated show which viewers
assume it as to be real. A number of figures whose lives are recorded
are observed to change in attitudes and characters procreating delusion.
Similarly, the viewing audience also is taken into the decision making
processes by which they are held close in the simulated world of it.
**[[Baudrillard's media theory is]{.mark}]{.underline}** sought to be
**[[experimentally verified]{.mark} in terms of recipients, media events
and media content as a whole [in Turkish society]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Thus, the study has showed that the media messages are to a great extent
cultivated in the concious and reflected in material life eliminating
the authentic meaning of the object. The substituted meaning of the
object then becomes ambigous and transparent that problematizes an
ontological complication. Baudrillard's [hyperreality stems from at this
point where it becomes impossible to define neither authentic nor
substituted meaning of any material existence as it has been submerged
in a chaotic perception]{.underline} which we see in the case of
Survivor viewers. It is found out that viewers believe what they watch
are real and their responds bear a great many implications from
programme depictions. Moreover, their perception is measured in
accordance with what they are exposed on the screen, their wish,
desires, hatred or anger are shaped and exhibition of an affinity is
reassured through character identification and closeness that is
emotionally fixed.

### **[War]{.underline}**

#### **The West wages war to [simulate meaning,]{.underline} to convince an increasingly unphased public that the West [matters.]{.underline} This produces endless and arbitrary wars of intervention and humanitarianism in a sad attempt to hide the collapse of all grand narratives.**

**Hammond 11** (Philip, PhD, Reader in Media and Communications at
London South Bank University, "Simulation and Dissimulation," Journal of
War and Cultural Studies 3 (3): 305-318)

To dissimulate is to pretend not to have what one has. To simulate is to
feign to have what one doesn't have. One implies a presence, the other
an absence. (Baudrillard 1994a: 3)

[Much analysis and critique of the news media's role in representing war
has centred on]{.underline} the issue of propaganda -- including,
importantly, [propaganda directed at a domestic audience for the
purposes of justifying war and maintaining public support.]{.underline}
[Critics have drawn attention to 'information management' on the part of
governments and the military, and have examined the extent to which
journalists are willing to challenge the official version of events. The
process tends to be understood as one of dissimulation,]{.underline}
[whereby political leaders disguise the real reasons for going to war,
clothing self-interest in a nobler rhetoric. The task of the critic is
to peel away misleading official justifications and to expose the real
interests at stake.]{.underline}

This article argues that, **[while propaganda and dissimulation remain
relevant concepts to the critique of war representation, in the
contemporary context it often makes more sense to understand the media
presentation of war -- and even war itself -- in terms of
simulation.]{.underline}** Our interest here is not in battlefield
technologies, military training simulations, video games and media
spectacles created by what James Der Derian, in the subtitle of his 2001
book, calls the 'Military-Industrial-Media-Entertainment Network', but
rather in how **[the concept [of simulation can be extended to encompass
the rationale for and conduct of war]{.mark}, as well as its media
representation.]{.underline}** Drawing together recent work in
international relations theory and postmodernist writing on the media
and war, the article suggests that **[far-reaching political changes
since [the end of the Cold War ]{.mark}]{.underline}**have **[[led
western elites to use war and intervention]{.mark} as a way [to simulate
purposeful activity]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

In what follows, we first examine this post-Cold War context, asking
whether it still makes sense to understand western foreign policy in
terms of the pursuit of (hidden) interests. The article then briefly
considers how far the role of the media in conflict and intervention has
changed, and asks how far it is still useful to conceptualize that role
in terms of dissimulation. We then consider the alternative framework
suggested by the idea of simulation. It is argued that, **[for western
political elites, war and intervention have often appeared to hold out
the possibility of simulating a sense of purpose and mission, [in
response to]{.mark}]{.underline}** what Zaki Laïdi (1998: 1) calls
**[[the 'crisis of meaning']{.mark} precipitated by the end of the Cold
War.]{.underline}**

INTERPRETING THE END OF THE COLD WAR

Understandably, [the end of the Cold War is]{.underline} often
understood as a moment of ideological triumph for the West. Yet it is
important to remember that it was, at the same time, also [a moment of
ideological crisis.]{.underline} Francis Fukuyama's 'end of history'
thesis expresses the bittersweet character of the Cold War victory: his
argument is at once triumphalist and an acknowledgement that there is no
longer any vision of the future:

The end of history will be a very sad time \[. . .\] [the worldwide
ideological struggle that called forth daring, courage, imagination, and
idealism]{.underline}, will be [replaced by economic calculation, the
endless solving of technical problems, environmental concerns, and the
satisfaction of sophisticated consumer demands.]{.underline} (Fukuyama
1989: 18)

Arguing that liberal-democratic capitalism now faced no challengers
comparable to Soviet Communism, Fukuyama said he felt 'ambivalent' about
the West's victory, and anticipated the 'prospect of centuries of
boredom'. In terms of foreign policy, the problem came to be understood
as 'enemy-deprivation syndrome'. As one commentator puts it: **['[as
soon as]{.mark} the initial euphoria over [the Soviet Union's
collapse]{.mark} had [passed]{.mark}, most of the [American
foreign-policy]{.mark} cognoscenti]{.underline}** \[. . .\] **[[began to
search for a substitute enemy']{.underline}]{.mark}** (Harries 1997:
35).

Over the years, substitutes have proved easy to find, from former US
ally turned 'new Hitler' **[[Saddam]{.mark} Hussein,]{.underline}**
through **[[Somali 'warlords', Haitian generals]{.mark} and [Serbian
'Nazis']{.mark}, to [Islamist terrorists]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
**[There have also been a number of attempts to rethink the overall
framework within which such figures might be seen as enemies
and]{.underline}**, more importantly, **[within which the United
States]{.underline}**, or the West more broadly, **[might be seen as
engaged in a coherent mission]{.underline}** comparable to the Cold War.
The two main ideas in this respect have been **['[humanitarian
intervention' and 'War on Terror']{.mark}, both]{.underline}** of which
**[[foreground 'values']{.mark}, rather than interests, [as the basis
for policy]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

The first of these ideas was quickly put into practice at the end of the
1991 [Gulf War]{.underline}, when, having expelled Iraqi troops from
Kuwait, the western 'allies' then set up no-fly zones and safe havens to
protect Kurdish and other refugees. By the end of the decade, in the
1999 [Kosovo]{.underline} conflict, the full might of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO) was thrown behind what was known in Britain
as 'ethical foreign policy' -- [a policy based on moral norms of right
and wrong, rather than the naked self-interest of
Realpolitik.]{.underline} [The 'War on Terror' interventions in
Afghanistan and Iraq]{.underline} were also, at least in part, justified
in similar terms. [A war of self-defence and retaliation in Afghanistan
was simultaneously cast as a war for human rights and women's
emancipation, and involved dropping humanitarian aid packages as well as
bombs. The war to pre-empt the supposed threat of Iraqi 'weapons of mass
destruction']{.underline} (WMD) [was said by coalition leaders to be
also about 'liberating the Iraqi people'.]{.underline} According to
former British prime minister Tony Blair, the 'crucial point' about the
interventions in both Afghanistan and Iraq was that 'they were not just
about changing regimes but changing the value systems governing the
nations concerned' (Blair 2006: 19). Senior British diplomat Robin
Cooper, a former foreign policy advisor to Blair who became director of
'politico-military affairs' for the European Union (EU), has even
developed such claims into a theory of the 'postmodern international
order'. For 'postmodern states' such as Britain, he argues, **['state
interest becomes less of a determining factor in foreign policy', which
is instead about undertaking 'intervention for values' and fighting
'wars of principle']{.underline}** (Cooper 2004: 53, 61).

Looked at in terms of the concept of dissimulation, such ideas may be
understood as no more than attempts to construct a new ideological cover
for the pursuit of foreign policy interests. Despite the epochal break
of the end of the Cold War, many critics have tended to emphasize
continuity, suggesting that both the Cold War and the period since have
basically been 'business as usual' for western imperialism. Radical
journalist John Pilger, for example, describes the post-1989 era as a
'New Cold War', and writes of 'the unchanging nature of the 500-year
western imperial crusade' (Pilger 1999: 38, 21). Similarly, Noam Chomsky
has argued that for the United States the Cold War was

largely a war against the third world, and a mechanism for retaining a
degree of influence over its industrial rivals and, crucially, a mode of
domestic social organization. And nothing has changed in that respect.
So the Cold War hasn't ended. (Chomsky 1990: 6)

From this perspective, all the talk of humanitarian concern, or the
promotion of 'War on Terror' are really just a cover for the pursuit of
self-interest. Uwe-Jens Heuer and Gregor Schirmer (1998), for example,
critique 'human rights imperialism' on the grounds that, in many cases,
'the altruism of the intervening parties was a mere secondary phenomenon
to crude self- interested efforts toward the expansion of political and
military power, spheres of economic influence, and the like.'

**[Yet it has not always been easy for critics to make a convincing case
about how post-Cold War military interventions have furthered the 'crude
self-interest' of western powers.]{.underline}** The explanation offered
for the 1991 Gulf War -- that despite the rhetoric of good and evil, it
was really just a 'war for oil' -- has been wheeled out time and again,
even in the unlikeliest of circum- stances. [Everything from the US-led
United Nations 'humanitarian' military mission to Somalia launched in
1992, through NATO's 1999 Kosovo campaign, to today's ongoing
counter-insurgency operations in Afghanistan has been viewed in terms of
this one-size-fits-all explanation, as basically about securing access
to oil and gas on behalf of US corporations]{.underline} (cf. Fineman
1993; Goodman 2009; Klare 2005). Twenty years on from the end of the
Cold War, **[[it is not obvious]{.mark} how [humanitarian or anti-terror
military interventions]{.mark} have [serve]{.mark}d [the]{.mark} direct
self-interest of the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates and other western
powers. Even if the argument is cast]{.underline}** in more general
terms, **[as a matter of securing US imperial hegemony and heading off
potential rivals]{.underline}**, as suggested by Chomsky's comments
cited above, **[it seems unconvincing because the United States has not
really faced any serious challengers in any of the campaigns
fought]{.underline}** since 1989. **[The [wars and interventions
undertaken]{.mark} by the United States and its allies [have been
against weak states or sub-state groups, who]{.mark} have [presented
very little]{.mark} in the way of [military, economic or ideological
challenge to western capitalism]{.mark}. Securing access to oil, or
securing hegemonic dominance do not appear to be sufficient as
explanations of the near-constant military activity undertaken by
western states over the last two decades.]{.underline}**

A NEW ROLE FOR THE MEDIA?

The question of how one interprets the motivations behind wars and
interventions has a direct bearing on how one understands the role of
the media. Unable to see any obvious self-interest behind some of the
operations under-taken by the western military since the end of the Cold
War, **[many commentators began to wonder if the media had not in fact
taken on a new role, actually leading an interventionist policy
stance.]{.underline}** Contemplating 'Operation Restore Hope', the
aforementioned 'humanitarian military intervention' in Somalia, for
example, veteran US diplomat George Kennan argued that it was irrational
to undertake a costly and protracted mission in a country where there
was 'no defensive American interest'. He concluded that the decision to
launch Operation Restore Hope must have been **[driven by media coverage
of suffering and the consequent public pressure for action. Policy had
been 'controlled by popular emotional impulses \[. . .\] provoked by the
commercial television industry',]{.underline}** he argued (Kennan 1993).
Kennan's argument was an influential formulation of the concept of the
'CNN effect': the notion that **[the crises spotlighted by real-time
global television news dominate the foreign-policy agenda of western
states. The idea has common sense appeal as an explanation for the
apparent arbitrariness of western actions, but subsequent studies have
mostly failed to substantiate the existence of the CNN
effect]{.underline}** (cf. Livingston 1997; Livingston and Eachus 1995;
Mermin 1999; Robinson 2002). **[In the case of Somalia]{.underline}**,
as Jonathan Mermin (1999: 137) concludes, **[the intervention was not
'evidence' of the power of television to move governments' but of 'the
power of governments to move television'. Coverage followed the agenda
of US policy-makers, rather than leading it.]{.underline}**

While the media may not have been dictating the foreign policy agenda,
however, there is plenty of evidence that many journalists came to
understand their role in these terms. In a series of reports from
Somalia in May 1992, for example, one CNN correspondent accused the US
of having ignored starving children who 'want the world to see \[\...\]
and to forcefully act'; another said the West would be 'neither forgiven
nor forgotten' if it did not mount 'a massive, coordinated rescue
mission' (quoted in Mermin 1999: 132). As Mermin demonstrates, these
**[explicit calls for action had no discernible impact on public opinion
or government policy]{.underline}** at the time, but they do indicate
that journalists thought their job was not simply to report but to put
pressure on politicians to act. In Britain the best-known proponent of
this approach is the former BBC correspondent Martin Bell, who coined
the phrase 'the journalism of attachment' (Bell 1998: 16) to describe a
style of journalism that 'cares as well as knows', and which 'will not
stand neutrally between good and evil, right and wrong, the victim and
the oppressor'. In place of what Bell called the 'dispassionate
practices of the past', **[an emotive style of 'attached' journalism
would strive to whip up public concern and thereby pressure western
governments to intervene]{.underline}** (Bell 1998: 16). In the United
States a similar argument, in favour of 'advocacy journalism', is
associated with CNN reporter Christiane Amanpour, who admonished former
president Bill Clinton on live television in May 1994 for failing to
articulate a tough policy on Bosnia (Ricchiardi 1996: 26).

**[It is a moot point whether such advocacy journalism actually had much
impact on policy]{.underline}**, although it could be considered
significant in terms of what Piers Robinson (2002: 40) calls a
'potential CNN effect', whereby policy is formulated with one eye on how
it might look in the media. But even putting aside the question of media
influence, the fact that many reporters came to see their job as
proselytizing for intervention should nevertheless give us pause**[. We
should not exaggerate the extent of the clash between journalists, who
tended to cast themselves in a flattering light as harsh critics of
western governments, and political leaders, whom journalists criticized
in a way that, far from questioning their authority to intervene
militarily around the globe, actually presumed it and cast it as a moral
imperative.]{.underline}** **[Yet the fact remains that]{.underline}**,
in the conflicts and crises of the 1990s, **[the relationship between
political leaders and the media was not simply one of top-down
propaganda designed to legitimize military intervention, but rather
involved journalists' own spontaneous efforts to pressure apparently
reluctant political elites to adopt a tougher, more interventionist
policy.]{.underline}**

A further anomaly, from the point of view of established critiques of
the relationship between the media and government in wartime, is
presented by the 2003 Iraq War, when -- at least in Britain -- the media
took a far more critical stance than would be expected. A number of
analysts have highlighted a 'legitimation of dissent' in the mainstream
UK press (Couldry and Downey 2004: 280), whereby anti-war views were
'given space and prominence in the media' (Tumber and Palmer 2004: 164)
in a way that is highly unusual in wartime. Perhaps the most striking
example is the popular *Daily Mirror* news- paper, which abandoned its
usual diet of tabloid trivia in favour of front-page anti-war articles
by radical journalist John Pilger (Freedman 2003: 95--97, 103). Without
wishing to overstate the extent of media opposition to the war, it is
clear that in this case **[mainstream coverage was neither uniformly
supportive nor straightforwardly propagandistic]{.underline}**.

[From the perspective of dissimulation, the choice would seem to be
either naively to accept official propaganda claims as true, or to
unmask them as a misrepresentation of the real interests driving war and
intervention]{.underline}. In contrast, **[the view of war and
intervention as simulation potentially opens up a different way of
criticizing the media representation of war: neither seeking to uncover
'real', hidden interests, nor accepting the rhetorical justifications of
war at face value]{.underline}**. The next section further explores this
notion of contemporary war as simulation, and considers its implications
for analysing media coverage of war.

WAR AS SIMULATION

An alternative view of **[[the end of the Cold
War]{.underline}]{.mark}** is offered by international relations
theorist Zaki Laïdi, who argues that it has **[[left us in 'a world
without meaning']{.mark}. The fall of the Berlin Wall]{.underline}**, he
contends, '**[buried two centuries of Enlightenment', in that it
signalled the end, not only of communism, but of all forward-looking
collective projects for the foreseeable future]{.underline}** (Laïdi
1998: 1). In postmodernist terms, one might say that **[the end of the
Cold War represented [a collapse of grand
narratives]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Laïdi 1998: 8). **[This has clearly
[had a]{.mark} directly [debilitating effect on the Left]{.mark} and on
national liberation movements in the Third World,]{.underline}** in that
**[the ideas through which they had articulated a vision of the future
now stand discredited]{.underline}**. Just as importantly, what Laïdi
calls **[the 'crisis of meaning' has fundamentally affected western
societies and their governing elites.]{.underline}** Put at its
simplest, **[[the West]{.mark} has [lost]{.mark} its [cohesion because
it]{.mark} has [lost its enemy. The ideological cement]{.mark} which
[anti-communism provided as a]{.mark} negative [justification of western
capitalism]{.mark} has [crumbled away,]{.mark} and [the system of
institutions through which international relations were
organized]{.mark} throughout most of the post-World War II era has [lost
its justification]{.mark}. Worst of all, [western elites have lost the
political wherewithal to cohere their]{.mark} own [societies around a
meaningful project and to give them]{.mark} a sense of [a future goal.
]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**[[Efforts to rethink the international role of the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [and its allies]{.mark} in the aftermath of the Cold War
[have been driven by the]{.mark} felt [need to reinvigorate]{.mark} the
[domestic politics]{.mark} of the West [and to reconnect with an
increasingly disengaged electorate]{.mark}.]{.underline}** As
neoconservative thinkers William Kristol and Robert Kagan (1996) put it,
'**[The remoralization of America at home ultimately requires the
remoralization of American foreign policy]{.underline}**.' Complaining
that they were living in 'tepid times', in which **[the public viewed
foreign affairs with 'the same routine indifference as breathing and
eating',]{.underline}** Kristol and Kagan hoped that if 'a more elevated
vision of America's international role' could be found, this might help
to 'restore a sense of the heroic'. It is telling that of the 'three
imperatives' advanced by Kristol and Kagan for reforming US foreign
policy, only one -- increased defence expenditure -- was directly
concerned with international affairs. Their other two priorities --
'citizen involvement' and 'moral clarity' -- indicated **[that their
underlying concern was with engaging people at home rather than
accomplishing any strategic objective abroad.]{.underline}**

From the perspective suggested by Laïdi's analysis, one might say that
**[for the governing elites of societies that have lost belief in any
grand narrative of progress, [war and intervention]{.mark} seem to
[offer opportunities to rediscover some sense of a meaningful
project]{.mark}.]{.underline}** As Laïdi puts it:

war is no longer a continuation of politics by other means, as in \[Carl
von\] Clausewitz's classic model -- but sometimes the initial expression
of forms of activity or organization in search of meaning \[. . ..\]
**[War becomes not the ultimate means to achieve an objective, but the
most 'efficient' way of finding one.]{.underline}** (Laïdi 1998: 95)

In his commentaries on the 1991 Gulf War, Jean Baudrillard offered a
similar 'variant on Clausewitz', arguing that the **[conflict was 'the
absence of politics pursued by other means]{.underline}** \[. . .\]'
(Baudrillard 1995: 83). **[[The hollowing-out of the political
life]{.mark} of western nations after the end of the clashing ideologies
of Left and Right [leaves political elites]{.mark} disconnected from
their own societies, [unable to offer any inspiring vision of the
future]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In these circumstances[, **[war,
intervention and foreign policy-making]{.underline}** ]{.mark}**[have
[appeared to offer elites an arena in which such a vision may be
simulated.]{.mark}]{.underline}** This idea is taken up by David
Chandler in his discussion of the EU's foreign policy. Drawing on
Baudrillard's concept of simulation, Chandler argues that [EU policy is
not driven by the pursuit of self- interest which is then dissembled by
shrouding it in a rhetoric of 'European values', but can better be
understood as the simulation of a mission or project where none
exists:]{.underline}

[For the EU, every external measure, from trade regulations to foreign
aid, to the sending of troops abroad, comes attached with the necessity
of expressing the EU's alleged shared 'identity' and 'values' in the
increasingly shrill and desperate simulation of these absent
factors.]{.underline} (Chandler 2007: 4)

As Chandler emphasizes, **[what gives rise to this simulation is an
'attempt to overcome, bypass or evade political elites' lack of
connection with their own societies']{.underline}**. From this
perspective, what is important is 'not \[. . .\] a presence (of
interests, of representation) but \[. . .\] an absence (a lack of social
connection between elites and society and therefore of a lack of social
power)' (Chandler 2007: 2).

**[If international intervention since the end of the Cold War has been
driven by the attempt to simulate a sense of purpose, however, it has
also been undermined by the crisis of meaning.]{.underline}** From the
1991 Gulf War to the War on Terror launched a decade later,
**[[intervention has been]{.mark} reactive and [opportunistic,
responding to perceived threats and crises rather than acting]{.mark} in
line [with some strategic project.]{.mark}]{.underline}** As Chandler
notes, **[the key 'difference between [simulation]{.mark} and
interest-based policy-making' is that the former [expresses 'the
weakness of the political actor'.]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[Rather than
indicating strong and united western elites, confidently pursuing their
interests in an unchanging imperial mission, [post- Cold War policy has
been]{.mark} 'much more [arbitrary]{.mark} and ad-hoc']{.underline}**
(Chandler 2007: 5), **[[lurching from one crisis to the next with
no]{.mark} clear [strategic end in view.]{.mark} The]{.underline}** so-
called **[Bush doctrine of pre-emptive war against
'terror']{.underline}** was widely criticized as **[implying [an endless
series of military engagements in a global conflict that would never
come to any conclusion.]{.mark}]{.underline}** The same could be said of
**[the notion of [humanitarian intervention]{.mark} -- of wars
undertaken for human rights or other 'ethical' reasons --]{.underline}**
which **[also [implies boundless military action without any]{.mark}
obvious chronological or strategic [end]{.mark} point. Such [blanket
justification for future wars]{.mark} might be seen, less as a sign of
ideological strength, and more as an [indicat]{.mark}ion [that political
leaders have found it increasingly difficult to define their
interests]{.mark} in the absence of the Cold War enemy.]{.underline}**

Both of the points above -- that **[post-Cold War interventions have
been largely arbitrary and reactive, rather than unfolding some grand
strategy]{.underline}**, and that **[the impetus driving activism abroad
has been the emptiness of public political life at home]{.underline}**
-- were anticipated in Baudrillard's commentaries on the 1991 Gulf War.
These essays -- in which he predicted that the war would not take place;
asked, once it had started, if it was 'really' taking place; and
maintained afterwards that it 'did not take place' -- struck many
commentators at the time as uncritical and irrelevant (cf. Norris 1992).
The most, it seemed, that could be said for Baudrillard's position was
that it drew attention, in hyperbolic fashion, to the way that sanitized
news footage of high-tech 'smart' weapons and 'surgical strikes'
obscured the deadly effects of a conflict so militarily one-sided that
its outcome was never in doubt (Patton 1995: 18). But for most critics,
the point was to contrast the misleading media imagery with the reality
of the war's lethal effects, not to raise seemingly nonsensical
questions about the 'reality' of the conflict itself. Yet [Baudrillard
was,]{.underline} no doubt, as [aware]{.underline} as anyone else [that
the Gulf War was literally real]{.underline}; that, as he had written
earlier, '**[[war is no less atrocious for being]{.mark} only [a
simulacrum -- the flesh suffers just the same,]{.mark} and the dead and
former combatants are worth the same as in other wars']{.underline}**
(Baudrillard 1994a: 37--38). His point, rather, was that **[[what was
missing]{.mark} in simulated war [was]{.mark} 'the reality of
antagonistic causes, [the ideological seriousness of
war']{.mark}]{.underline}** (Baudrillard 1994a: 38).

[The claim that the Gulf War 'did not take place' is best
understood]{.underline}, in other words, [as a political
proposition:]{.underline} that **[[in the absence of a grand narrative
to make sense of the enterprise, war had become meaningless]{.mark},
empty, difficult to believe in:]{.underline}**

Unlike earlier wars, in which there were political aims either of
conquest or domination, what is at stake in this one is [war
itself]{.underline}: its status, its meaning, its future. It [is
beholden not to have an objective but to prove its very
existence]{.underline} \[. . ..\] In effect, [it has lost much of its
credibility.]{.underline} (Baudrillard 1995: 32)

**[The lack of credibility derived from the absence of a shared
framework of meaning that would make the war politically 'real' and
historically important.]{.underline}** In this sense, Baudrillard
suggested, **[[the Gulf War was less a battle with Saddam than a
struggle to make sense of the West's role in the post-Cold War
world:]{.mark}]{.underline}**

It is not an important match which is being played out in the Gulf,
between Western hegemony and the challenge from the rest of the world.
**[It is the West in conflict with itself]{.underline}**, by means of an
interposed Saddam. (Baudrillard 1995: 38)

**[Saddam was]{.underline}**, as Baudrillard (1995: 38) pointed out,
**[a 'fake enemy']{.underline}**. But the fakery was
**[necessary,]{.underline}** not as a disguise for some hidden interest
or purpose, but **[to try to produce some sense of
purpose]{.underline}**. Unlike in the past, he suggested, **[war 'no
longer proceeds from a political will to dominate or from a vital
impulsion or an antagonistic violence']{.underline}**. Instead, **[it
was an attempt to overcome the internal problems of western
societies.]{.underline}**

Baudrillard made a similar argument about the international response to
the Bosnian conflict. Commenting on a December 1993 Strasbourg --
Sarajevo television broadcast titled 'A corridor for free speech', and
on recent visits to Sarajevo by intellectuals such as Susan Sontag,
Baudrillard ridiculed the 'false apostles and voluntary martyrs' who
went to Bosnia for a spot of 'cultural soul- boosting':

**[It is we who are weak and who go there to make good for our loss of
strength and sense of reality]{.underline}** \[. . ..\] \[**[We\] feel
the need to salvage the reality of war]{.underline}** in our own eyes
\[\...\]

Susan Sontag \[. . .\] must know better than them what reality is, since
she has chosen them to incarnate it. Or maybe it is simply because
reality is what she, and with her all the Western world, is lacking the
most \[. . ..\] **[[All these 'corridors', opened]{.mark} by us to
funnel our foodstuffs and our 'culture' [are]{.mark} in fact our
[lifelines along which we suck their moral strength and the energy of
their distress]{.mark}]{.underline}** \[.. . .\] Susan Sontag comes to
convince them of **[the 'reality' of their
[suffering]{.mark}]{.underline}**, by making something cultural and
something theatrical out of it, so that it **[[can be useful as a
referent within the theatre of Western values,]{.underline}]{.mark}**
including 'solidarity'. (Baudrillard 1994b)

Characteristically, Baudrillard couched his argument in terms of a loss
of 'reality', but this should be understood in the same way as his
doubts about the reality of the Gulf War. That is to say**[, it was not
existential angst so much as [the political exhaustion of western
societies]{.mark} that [sent intellectuals]{.mark} and adventurers [to
Sarajevo]{.mark}. Bosnia was interesting to them [because of what it
could be made to mean in the 'theatre of western
values'.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

[This helps to explain the moral fervour for intervention apparently
felt by 'attached' journalists: as professional mediators charged with
the task of explaining the world to their audiences, they too were
responding to the crisis of meaning by helping to shape the presentation
of events according to simplistic moral narratives of good versus
evil.]{.underline} As Mick Hume (1997: 18) suggests in relation to the
Bosnian War, [advocacy reporting provided 'a twisted sort of therapy,
through which foreign reporters \[could\] discover some sense of purpose
-- first for themselves, and then for their audience back home', as
journalists undertook a 'moral mission on behalf of a demoralized
society']{.underline}. In this sense, as far as both political leaders
and advocacy journalists are concerned, **[the overall approach to
[international humanitarian intervention was essentially
narcissistic]{.mark}: more about seeking a meaningful mission for the
West than helping those on the receiving end.]{.underline}** According
to Michael Ignatieff, one of those intellectuals for whom Bosnia became
a *cause célèbre*, 'when **[policy]{.underline}** was **[driven by moral
motives]{.underline}**, it **[was]{.underline}** often **[driven by
narcissism':]{.underline}**

**[We intervened not only to save others, but to save
ourselve]{.underline}**s, or rather **[an image of ourselves as
defenders of universal decencies. We wanted to know that the West
'meant' something.]{.underline}** This imaginary West, this narcissistic
image of ourselves, we believed was incarnated in the myth of a
multiethnic, multiconfessional Bosnia \[. . ..\] Bosnia became the
latest *bel espoir* of a generation that had tried ecology, socialism,
and civil rights only to watch all these lose their romantic momentum.
(Ignatieff 1998: 95)

Ignatieff's comment not only captures how [**[this search for meaning
stemmed directly from the emptiness of western politics and
disillusionment with grand narratives]{.underline}**,]{.mark} it also
indicates that the search was ultimately unsuccessful.

**[Baudrillard]{.underline}** (2002: 34) also **[characterized the War
on Terror in terms of the pursuit of the 'absence of politics' by other
means]{.underline}**. Indeed, his descriptions of the first 'non-war' on
Iraq sound even more applicable to the 2003 sequel. He observed, for
example, that **[Saddam's military strength was
exaggerated]{.underline}** in 1991 by

**[[brandishing the threat of a chemical war, a bloody war, a world
war]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- everyone had their say -- **[as though it
were necessary to give ourselves a fright, to maintain everyone in a
state of erection [for fear of seeing]{.mark} the flaccid member of [war
fall down]{.mark}.]{.underline}** (Baudrillard 1995: 74)

His account of this 'futile masturbation' could just as well have been
written about the talking up of **[Iraq's non-existent WMD
capability]{.underline}** in 2003, or about **[the West's exaggerated
fear of al-Qaeda]{.underline}**. Similarly, Baudrillard's remark that
**['the war ended in general boredom, or worse in the feeling of being
duped]{.underline}** \[. . ..\] It is as though there were a virus
infecting this war from the beginning which emptied it of all
credibility' (Baudrillard 1995: 62) now calls to mind the efforts to
build public support for the 2003 invasion with dubious dossiers of
'evidence', and the interminable enquiries and post-mortems that
followed.

**[The difficulty of making war seem meaningful and credible means that
media presentation has assumed a disproportionate
significance]{.underline}**. This is not to say, of course, that image
and myth-making were not important in the past: Richard Keeble (1997:
8), for example, notes how a form of 'unreal warfare' developed in the
1980s with Britain's Falklands conflict and US interventions in Grenada
and Libya, in which war became essentially a 'media event'. Yet in these
earlier interventions, the media event was clearly tied to established
political or ideological themes -- such as British nationalism or
anti-communism. After the end of the Cold War, in contrast**[, [staging
the spectacle of war has become a substitute for an inspiring cause to
rally public support]{.mark}, and media presentation has consequently
become even more central.]{.underline}** As Baudrillard wrote in 1991:
'The media mix has become the prerequisite to any orgasmic event. We
need it precisely because the event escapes us, because conviction
escapes us' (1995: 75). **[In the 2003 invasion of Iraq]{.underline}**,
**[the United States announced that it would use 'shock and awe' bombing
and 'effects-based' warfare, designed to win by demoralizing the enemy
rather than by killing him.]{.underline}** It was as if Pentagon
planners had studied Baudrillard and decided that this time it really
would be a 'bloodless' war-show. **[In a triumph of media-military
cooperation, the military campaign was propaganda and the propaganda was
part of the military strategy. Reporters were embedded with the
coalition forces to produce dramatic footage of the front-line advance
which, it was hoped, would cheer domestic audiences while intimidating
Iraqi leaders, who were known to be watching the same
images.]{.underline}** Senior Iraqi figures were then contacted directly
by US officials via phone and e-mail to reinforce the message that they
should give up.

[Yet the effectiveness of the propaganda was undermined by the way that
the news media self-consciously drew attention to its deliberately
manufactured quality.]{.underline} Rather than simply reporting events,
journalists often discussed them in terms of news management and image
projection, such as on 29 April 2003, when one BBC *Newsnight* presenter
contrasted pictures of angry Iraqis protesting against the shooting of
demonstrators with the day's 'intended message' delivered by US Defense
Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. On a day when the most significant weapons
find was a factory making bullets, another journalist for BBC One noted
that 'the Americans very deliberately drove captured Iraqi missiles past
the media hotel in Baghdad,' on 17 April 2003. It would be an
exaggeration to describe such reporting as critical or oppositional, but
coverage was often cynical and self-conscious, putting journalists at an
ironic distance from events.

If **[the obvious effort to generate good PR simply confirmed the
perception that the war's presentation was carefully calculated and
manipulative,]{.underline}** an even greater problem was the fact that
**[the coalition often seemed unsure about what message it wished to
project. Traditional themes -- promoting a martial, national or western
identity -- seemed to cause discomfort instead of rallying
support.]{.underline}** This was why news audiences witnessed the Stars
and Stripes being proudly hoisted in Iraq one minute, only to see it
hauled down in embarrassment the next. British journalists were
apparently also instructed not to 'take any pictures or describe British
soldiers carrying guns', and were told 'to not portray \[. . .\] the
British fighting men and women as fighters', as reported on the BBC Two
programme *Correspondent* on 18 May 2003. The British elite expressed
similar concerns about appearing too militaristic in the way they
celebrated victory, worrying about whether to hold a victory parade, a
'cavalcade' or a church ser- vice after the Iraq campaign. In the event,
there was a 'multi-faith service of remembrance', designed to be
'sensitive to other traditions, other experiences and other faiths',
including Islam, and commemorating Iraqi military and civilian dead
alongside British losses. **[An inability to celebrate victory or to
portray soldiers as fighters was symptomatic of elite incoherence; of a
lack of agreed unifying values; of the very 'absence of politics' that
the war was supposed to address]{.underline}**.

CONCLUSION: THE LIMITS OF SIMULATION

This article has argued that **[contemporary war and intervention are
driven by an attempt to simulate meaning and purpose in the post-Cold
War era when western societies found that they had]{.underline}**, in
Ignatieff's words, '**[lost \[their\] narrative, and]{.underline}** with
it, **[the rationale for engagement']{.underline}** (1998: 98). **[From
the 1991 Gulf War, through the pursuit of armed humanitarianism in the
Balkans and else- where, to the latest 'non-events' of the War on
Terror, [the western military]{.mark} have been [sent into action
against fake enemies whose defeat,]{.mark} it was hoped, [would prove
that the West must be]{.mark} engaged in a [meaningful and
important]{.mark} mission.]{.underline}** Ultimately, however[**, [these
attempts have been unsuccessful]{.mark}: even their supporters have been
unable to convince themselves that such wars are fully 'real'.** The
self-conscious and sometimes cynical tone of much of the coverage of the
2003 Iraq War seems like something of a departure from what has often
been seen as the mainstream media's 'normal' wartime loyalty and
propaganda service. In the case of humanitarian interventions -- when
journalists were more likely to respond with enthusiasm than scepticism
-- the coverage also indicated the limits to simulation.]{.underline}
Perhaps the clearest illustration of this was the highpoint of
humanitarian military intervention, the Kosovo conflict, when a
widespread disappointment with the outcome of this 'successful' war was
sometimes expressed in terms which recalled Baudrillard's doubts about
the 'reality' of the Gulf conflict. An *Independent* editorial on 10
June 1999, for example, asked: 'was it a "war" at all?'; and Ignatieff,
in the title of his 2000 book, described it as only a 'virtual war'. The
main reason the war was thought, even by its supporters, to lack
'reality' was that no western troops were killed. Complaining that the
war left a 'bitter taste', the same *Independent* editorial said there
was 'no sense of triumph, or of virtue rewarded', though there 'might
have been, had NATO suffered some casualties'. Similarly, in the
*Guardian* on 1 April 1999, Hugo Young wondered whether, if NATO forces
were 'not pre- pared to match their enemy's risk with their own', they
'cannot expect to win, and maybe don't deserve to?'; and in the same
newspaper on 5 April 1999, Isabel Hilton interpreted the unwillingness
to risk the lives of western troops as a symptom of the fact that 'we
are in a war that has no storyline we can believe in.'

Baudrillard's (1994b) remark at the time of the Bosnian War that the
West was 'merely expressing its own disappointment and longing for an
impossible violence against itself' was borne out by the Kosovo conflict
when commentators explicitly wished that their own soldiers would die to
make the war 'real'. Bizarre though this might seem, it expressed the
fact that '[**[ethical' intervention and wars for 'values']{.mark} had
[failed to offer a new]{.mark} source of [meaning for the post-Cold War
world.]{.mark}** [NATO's 'virtual war' showed]{.mark} the triumph of the
rhetoric but with [no wider political significance: 'citizens of NATO
countries \[. . ..\] were mobilized]{.mark}, not as combatants but [as
spectators \[. . ..\] \[The war\] aroused emotions in the]{.mark}
intense but [shallow way that sports do']{.mark}]{.underline} (Ignatieff
2000: 3). Like the Gulf, politically it was only a simulated war, not
the real thing.

Nevertheless, it is striking that, even before he took office, President
Barack Obama was being urged to 'use American power to reshape the
world' (Zakaria 2008), or to 'remake the case for humanitarian
intervention abroad' (*Economist* 2008). Such calls for action were
motivated, not so much by the need to address some specific problem, but
by a vaguer, general hope that the president would be able to
're-moralize' US foreign policy and offer a new narrative of engagement.
[Despite the limitations of simulated war, then, it seems unlikely that
we have seen the last of it.]{.underline}

#### Western civilization tries to re-legitimize itself through its threat of illegitimacy. Representations of war through the propagation of information have deposed "real war", rendering war ever "foggy" as we try to resolidify its meaning.

It is no coincidence that by the time of the Enlightenment, what
Copernicus had destabilized---sovereignty and the centrality of
civilization---became championedpolitical realities in the broad
spectrum of liberal social contract theory. [It is [only **after the
de-centering of "man" and civilization**]{.mark}]{.underline} that both
become [explicitly **[represented as central]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[[and the whole]{.mark} legal/juridical/ethical [edifice imagined by
**classical liberalism begins to take** **hold**]{.mark}.]{.underline}
If not for the strategic mediatization between warring sovereigns who,
in effect, dissolved each other's legitimacy, Hobbes would have had a
harder time envisaging a theory of sovereignty desperate enough to
locate true legitimacy---the authenticity of rule---into something like
a "representative" consent to rule (Hobbes, 1994). In other words, was
Hobbes not already operating at the level of a re-anchoring of
legitimacy (and legitimation of the sovereign, first and foremost),
after it had in fact already vanished? [Legitimacy only appears as a
categorical foundation of political order once it experiences its own
negation]{.underline}. [Legitimacy becomes a matter of political concern
when the sovereign]{.underline}, the demos, possibly "man" [is in need
of reconstitution.]{.underline} This is the mediatizing work of
representation too. **[[Representation murders what it
re-presents]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[but]{.mark} it [eventually tries
to]{.mark} re-solidify or **[re-constitute that which it has
murdered]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the first place. In this sense, and
as we hinted at above, [[representations of war in]{.mark}
[a]{.mark}]{.underline} mediatized/[[digitized age operate according to
a similar principle]{.mark}.]{.underline} The[y [have always **already
annihilated war's possibility (as an
event**]{.mark}]{.underline}**[)]{.mark}**, thus evoking Baudrillard's
provocative claim that "the gulf war did not take place." But
[representations [have also done away with all of war's "real"
boundaries, constraints, causes]{.mark}]{.underline}, and temporal
motivations/markers[, [thus rendering it **ever present, continuous,
foggy, and virulently operative.**]{.mark}]{.underline} Through the
dense manifold of classical liberalism[, [Western
civilization]{.mark}]{.underline} has sought to re-solidify or
re-anchoritself around a center (sovereignty, the state, the subject,
the demos, war, etc.), but, paradoxically, by way of its eccentricity.
[It [has tried to re-legitimate itself through the threat of its
illegitimacy.]{.mark}]{.underline} And it has attempted to re-realize
itself by way of its ever mediatized un-reality (or, better yet, its
undecidability as either real or unreal, thus leaving us with
hyper-reality). The social contract---abstractly understood as our
social ascent from the chaotic substratum of instinct and originary
violence, or primordial war---thus had to reconnect with several
theological functions of centralization, legitimation, and meaning
production, even if the organization of political power had lost any
semblance of organic, much less ordained, origins. This [[historical
tendency of representation to dissolve and
re-solidify]{.underline}]{.mark} may be broadly [[referred to as]{.mark}
**[hyper-mediatization]{.mark}**]{.underline}, which, as we have
suggested, is [[something]{.underline}]{.mark} [deeply [rooted in the
representation of war]{.mark}]{.underline} too. Within this tendency,
[[communication and information play important]{.mark} and functional
[roles as mechanisms of social]{.mark}]{.underline}
codification/[[signification]{.mark}/meaning-making]{.underline}. To be
sure, [[**communication/information** is the draw toward something
absent---the **social real**]{.mark},]{.underline} we will
say---precisely [because of its absence; it is a productive void in the
third order of simulation]{.underline} (Baudrillard, 1983: 11). [The
[**imperative to** communicate and]{.mark}]{.underline}, today, to
**[[propagate information]{.underline}]{.mark}** (digitally, if at all
possible) [is]{.underline} most likely [[born of the profound
undesirability of the **absence of** a core]{.mark},]{.underline} of
sovereignty, [of **[social reality]{.mark}**]{.underline}, or of the
subject, which, [paradoxically, [**efforts to communicate** **further
annihilate** by putting into **circulation a series of
appearances**.]{.mark}]{.underline} The "signs of the real" are
substituted for "the real itself," Baudrillard writes. It is "[[an
operation to deter every real process by its operational double,]{.mark}
a]{.underline} metastable, programmatic, **[[perfect descriptive
machine]{.underline}]{.mark}**" (Baudrillard, 1983: 4).

#### We must recognize war's dissolution through political analysis, as its precisely what allows the proliferation of war and its representational violence.

The various [[attempts at]{.mark} representing, explaining, justifying,
[or making sense of war and its violence]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark}
often in traditional referential geopolitical terms, are [[involved in
an infinite splitting of]{.mark} [what war must]{.mark} be or
[mean]{.mark} as much as they are concerned with a deepening and
widening of the violence/virulence of its (global)
representation]{.underline}. [[In its dissolutio]{.mark}n/dissemination
[through political analysis]{.mark}, [war reveals its violent]{.mark}
representational [forms]{.mark}.]{.underline} On the one hand,
analytically dissolved and disseminated, [war [becomes
**unlocalizable**]{.mark}, thus, in a way **[impossible to
contain]{.mark}**.]{.underline} [It [**can no longer "take
place.**"]{.underline}]{.mark} On the other hand, [[although]{.mark} it
can no longer be waged in one place]{.underline}, [[it still must
proliferate its effects]{.mark} virally and
[virulently.]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[Representationally unhinged from
any object]{.underline}]{.mark}** (and reifying no particular subject
or, rather, all sorts of subjects at once), [[war **can no longer
be**]{.mark} **[geopolitically maintained]{.mark},**]{.underline}
cultivated, and made use of by way of any of the (modern) categories
that once sought to give it gravity: geography, ideology, morality,
sovereignty, domination, or history. Thus, [war [becomes **strategically
useless**]{.mark} [even if,]{.mark} tactically[, it betrays the
violence]{.mark} or virulence [of representation everywhere it is
found.]{.mark}]{.underline} Just like in the image of terror/terrorism,
all we witness, then, is panic. Panic war is a "floating reality...
where we live on the edge of ecstasy and dread" (Kroker, Kroker, and
Cook, 1989: 14). Ungrounded, strategically indifferent, and yet
representationally effective and virulent, panic war no longer stands in
as the "substantial event" of time/history, as the referential hinge
that allows passage from one human epoch to the next. Today, Janus, the
God of passages, transitions, and attributions of meaning in time, may
still be worried about war. But Janus must now fixate his gaze in all
directions (thankfully, today's Janus is likely to have access to
YouTube...). The once mythologized and later romanticized uniqueness of
Janus' bioptic talents has been transmuted into an impossible
requirement of omniscience, omnivoyance, and omnipresence. The temple of
Janus, which was once a symbolic spatial conduit for the inertia of
time, has collapsed under the weight of an indifferent, perhaps more
catastrophic, inertia: the inertia not of war's violence
(counter-actable through peace), but rather of the violence of war's
representation (that knows no bounds and no antagonisms). [[War no
longer takes place in order to]{.mark} mediate time or [to usher
in]{.mark} a strategic ([political]{.mark}) [change]{.mark} through
conflict.]{.underline} Perhaps it never really did. Rather, [[as
representation]{.mark}, **[war tactically preserves and perpetuates
violent conflicts]{.mark}** [and a propensity for doing away
with]{.mark} [things (starting with meaning]{.mark}) [through]{.mark} a
kind of digital/[informational immanence]{.mark} (today's preferred
version of representation or mediation).]{.underline} Toward what
ends/futures does this war and its representation reproduce themselves
virally and virulently? Or, better yet, what compels us, if anything at
all, to reproduce this war and its violence through our fascination with
real-time digital technologies? Is it perhaps that the ideal of world
peace still seduce us and that we must continue to represent war so
that, if nothing else, we can always be there to try to antagonize it?
Or is it perhaps instead that we harbor a secret wish of global/total
annihilation, some will to terror hidden just beneath cognition, perhaps
to unsettle regimes of representation, meaning, and truth once and for
all? Are we and our digitized technologies of immediation advancing
boldly in the face of war and war's representation in the hope that our
will to total visibility/informationality can function as the accursed
share of the system? Is it such a principle (today's secret death wish,
perhaps), or is it another principle, more conventional but just as
sinister perhaps, the will to communicate in the open that can explain
that our opinions, theories, explanations, blogs, tweets, statuses,
SMS's, emails, video recordings, and photographs of war/terror/agony
have to surface in pixels and circulate by way of viral imaging? Could
it be that war is merely an excrescence, "\[a\]n indefinite extension:
metastasis" (Baudrillard, 2008: 52)? Read this way, [whether it has a
logic, whether it can be explained, [whether it can even be put into
language]{.mark} or in representation, [war would be like some sort of
cancerous growth, exceeding temporal/transitional
configurations.]{.mark}]{.underline} "[In a system where things are
increasingly governed by chance,]{.underline}" [Baudrillard writes,
"finality turns into delirium, and elements develop that know only too
well how to exceed their end---until they wind up invading the whole
system"]{.underline} (Baudrillard, 2008: 30). [[Without a
locatable]{.underline}]{.mark} or intelligible
object/[[subject]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[but equipped with the
representational virulence of the digital, war becomes an
in(de)terminable principle of decomposition and

Flow Markets In their work on forex markets, the most advanced example
of a flow market, Knorr-Cetina and Preda introduce the notion of a
global scopic reflex system.132 Because the "real economy," trading
transactions, and [[political and cultural]{.mark} events have been
[translated into a self-referential "world" of information on the
screen,]{.mark} for those individuals who participate in this system the
computer screen is the world.]{.underline} The [[global physical space
is condensed into screen space, and time is condensed into
"now-ness]{.underline}.]{.mark}" The information on the screen may
"contain" time (the figures, for example, may reflect the tracking of
past transactions) but only in the form of an aggregated "now market."
Time and space lose their depth: The screen reality . . . is like a
carpet of which small sections are woven and at the same time rolled out
in front of us. The carpet grounds experience; we can step on it, and
change our positioning on it. But this carpet composes itself as it is
rolled out; the spatial illusions it affords hide the intrinsic
temporality of the fact that its threads (the lines of text appearing on
screen) are woven into the carpet only as we step on it and unravel
again behind our back (the lines are updated and disappear). As the
carpet is woven it assumes different patterns; the weave provides
specific response slots to which traders react, taking the patterns in
different directions.133 The scopic medium is a network whose spatial
dimension has been almost completely condensed into its temporal
dimension, and the temporal dimension approximates the now-ness of a
perpetual flow out of nowhere into nothingness. It is "stable only long
enough to enable transactions to occur and changes with
transactions."134 Computer-based scopic systems replace "embodied
transaction and transmission capabilities by a set of technological and
behaviourally enhancing components that, together, serve as a medium for
the globally temporalized performance of these markets."135 The "global
reflex system of financial screens integrates within its framework the
conduits for building and maintaining relationships."136 Traders are
confronted "with a market that has become a 'life form' in its own
right, a 'greater being.'"137 [[Screens "instantly reflect, project, and
extend the reality of these markets]{.underline}]{.mark} in toto."138
Markets are characterized by "ontological liquidity:" "[The [flow of the
market reflects the corresponding stream of activities]{.mark} and
things: a [dispersed mass of market participants continues to act,
events continue to occur, policies take hold and have
effects.]{.mark}]{.underline}" [Markets]{.underline} are synchronically
well-defined but "ill-defined with respect to the direction they will
take at the next moment."139 [[This description of flow markets]{.mark}
[corresponds to the idea of network-centric
warfare]{.mark},]{.underline} except that here there can be no place for
someone corresponding to the---imagined---central commander on his
perch---someone who is apart from and overlooking the theater of war.140
[The [system of screens]{.mark} (interfaces) [integrates military
units]{.mark}, ultimately [individual combatants]{.mark}, who are
[immersed in a theater of war that has become a life form in its own
right]{.mark}. [Screens "instantly reflect, project, and extend the
reality" of these theaters of war to the
combatants]{.mark},]{.underline} potentially in toto. Combatants
continue to act; events occur, and strategies take hold and have
effects. [But because of their ontological liquidity these theaters of
war, as forms of life, though synchronically well-defined, will remain
unpredictable]{.underline}---a carpet rolled out into the future only to
unravel again the next moment. Global Frontierland The form of such flow
markets and global scopic reflex systems is analogous to the form of
Zygmunt Bauman's global frontierland, in which "alliances" and
"frontlines" are in constant flux, and coalitions represent no more than
"temporary cohabitations of convenience."141 This gives [[prime
importance to the gathering and---if possible
instantaneous---distribution of information]{.mark}.1]{.underline}42
Bauman therefore speaks of reconnaissance battles, which are meant to
explore the range of possible moves. These "bear striking resemblance to
'focus groups'" as "the modern politicians' favourite means of
anticipatory intelligence-gathering."143 This "[[confluence" between
military, economic, and political practices suggests that the "space of
flows]{.underline}]{.mark}"/flow-market model is assuming the place of a
transcendental model of reality that informs agency across all areas of
human activity. [[Information becomes a weapon]{.mark}: "Reconnaissance
battles are the principal category of violence in an under-regulated
environment."]{.underline}144 The ideal [[endpoint of
reconnaissance]{.mark} wars is the [capacity instantaneously to identify
a momentary enemy and take him or her out.]{.mark}]{.underline} Derek
Gregory describes the space of the "individual-as-target" by using
Kitchin and Dodge's term "code/space"---that is[, a [space produced and
activated by software whose spatiality is "simultaneously local and
global, grounded by spatiality in certain locations but accessible from
anywhere]{.mark} across the network."]{.underline}145 Individuation, in
this case, is the "technical production of an individual as an artefact
of targeting." Flesh-and-blood individuals "are brought within the
militarized field of vision through the rhythm analysis and network
analysis of a suspicious 'pattern of life,' a sort of weaponized
timegeography."146 [The [enemy]{.mark} is [identified by]{.mark} means
of a [technology that relies centrally on the expansion of generalized
data collection and its analysis]{.mark} "in a computerised process that
yields a network of relations commonly known as the disposition
matrix."]{.underline}147 The disposition matrix is "a grid" representing
gathered data from which "maps, target lists, individual watch lists and
interpersonal contacts" are constructed.148 As an "automated,
self-perpetuating intelligence system capable of transforming a large
amount of raw data into 'actionable intelligence'"149---recall Caerus's
"actionable insight," the same body in civilian clothes, so to
speak---it can potentially operate without direct human involvement. The
disposition matrix [[opens up the prospect "of a global hunting ground
produced through and punctuated by 'mobile zones of
exception]{.underline}]{.mark},'"150 the "kill boxes" of the military
strategists: "Kill boxes can be sized for open terrain or urban warfare
and opened or closed quickly in response to a dynamic military
situation."151 Chamayou speaks of "temporary lethal microtubes" that can
be opened up where "a legitimate target has been located:" the "body
becomes the battlefield."152 These microspaces "must be able to be aimed
\[at\] wherever necessary."153 [Thus, [the]{.mark} [human
body]{.mark}---or, rather, [the data set corresponding to
it]{.mark}---[becomes a globally mobile, globally tractable, and
globally targetable zone of hostility and of
exception.]{.mark}]{.underline} To the extent that the [[resulting
complexity and speed of the decision making exceeds the capacities of
human bodies, it must be automated]{.underline}]{.mark}: flash boys meet
hitmen in the digital semioscape of the global frontierland.154

#### The process of simulating [warfare]{.underline} results in a [techno-rationality]{.underline} inclined towards the [operation]{.underline} of [warfare]{.underline} which means they make [global nuclear war inevitable]{.underline} ,

In Platoni's "Pentagon Goes to the Arcade," first referenced in Chapter
4 of this book, she states that the move from **[[simulating
warfare]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[to carrying out]{.mark} the results of
the]{.underline} **[[simulation]{.mark} in warfare
settings]{.underline}** was "wrapped up in ... the idea that war in the
future will be different from the wars of the past, involving fewer
people and more machines, and [[keeping]{.underline}]{.mark} American
[[troops]{.underline}]{.mark} safe by allowing them to do their
**[[fighting]{.underline}]{.mark}** from **[[behind
a]{.underline}]{.mark}** computer **[[monitor]{.underline}]{.mark}**"
(para. 21). The problem with heavily relying on game theory and computer
simulations in combination with wargames is that the **[[networked
virtual wars]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[create]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[distanced warfare]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and humans on both sides
of a conflict are pushed further away from each other and reconstructed
as eventual results of math-guided, machine-aided violence. Mead
paraphrases Paul Edwards when he calls [[this]{.underline}]{.mark}
reliance "**[[techno-rationality]{.underline}]{.mark}**" and argues that
it [[speaks to]{.underline}]{.mark} a mode in which "new
**[technologies]{.underline}** \[are\] [seen as]{.underline} capable of
**[overcoming]{.underline}** the most **[difficult]{.underline}**
political and military **[circumstances]{.underline}**" (163); he then
adds that such an approach to warfare is problematic, because, quoting
an unnamed general, "\[within simulations\] things are going to go wrong
in the real world that you just can't predict. They're based on how
humans behave, not on how a machine behaves" (163). For De Landa, this
focus on planning and executing war based on "how a machine behaves"
generates models that struggle with relatively narrow simplicity in
addressing very specific combat situations under very specific rules and
cannot be "simply added up one on top of the other" (104). The problems
of computer-simulated wargames can largely be blamed on how both
modeling systems of war lack the ability to effectively simulate very
human problems such as fatigue, morale (100) and friction based on
specific personality, cultures, cultural histories, etc. (103). More, by
moving humans "out of the loop," military planners are putting their
trust in a computerized entity that De Landa argues is "much more
'reliable' than people in being willing to unleash a third world war"
(87). To this end, even though many game theory models of conficts agree
that "cooperative strategies are the most rational (the 'fttest') in the
long run" (86), De Landa critiques computer-aided wargames as
"artifcially blocking the paths to cooperation" because both **[[game
theory and computer simulations]{.underline}]{.mark}**, "imaginary
scenarios," [[generate]{.underline}]{.mark} "**[[pro-conflict
biases]{.underline}]{.mark}** and disguised \[those biases\] behind a
facade of mathematical neutrality" (84) by "\[encouraging\] a picture of
the adversary that emphasized confict at the expense of cooperation"
(97)This chapter locates some of the initial fears of computer-guided
simulations of war in WarGames, wherein the military's computer WOPR
(War Operation Plan Response) is accidentally hacked by a teenaged David
Lightman (Matthew Broderick); Lightman and WOPR then play what Lightman
thinks is a [[simulation of]{.underline}]{.mark} "**[[Global
Thermonuclear War]{.underline}]{.mark}**," [[which]{.underline}]{.mark},
after feeding the Americans at WOPR's control
"**[[faked]{.underline}]{.mark}**" **[[data]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[about]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[Russian missile
launches]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[leads to]{.underline}]{.mark} WOPR
actually **[[arming Russia-targeted missiles]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[initiating]{.underline}]{.mark}** a
**[[launch]{.underline}]{.mark}** sequence. This chapter will expand in
more depth on WarGames, as well as the artifcial intelligence EDI in
Stealth, but for now, both movies stand as popular examples of the
mistrust given to the notion of simulating warfare and its potential
"real-world" damages that emerges in instances that require putting
computers at such a central role in military decision making. Obviously
hardware and software have only advanced further since WarGames' 1983
release and the ability to simulate warfare has only increased in
fdelity. However, WarGames is useful to examine because WOPR is an early
example of van Creveld's warning that as simulations get more realistic
they get more dangerous: "A game capable of simulating every aspect of
war would become war" (Wargames 5). Der Derian points to the United
States as leading the way in this virtual revolution: "\[America's\]
diplomatic and military policies are increasingly based on technological
and representational forms of discipline, deterrence, and compellence
that could best be described as virtuous war" (author's italics 772).
This "**[[virtuous warfare]{.underline}]{.mark}**" is [[driven
by]{.underline}]{.mark} "the **[[technical
capability]{.underline}]{.mark}** and ethical imperative to threaten
and, if necessary, [[actualize]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[violence from a
distance]{.underline}]{.mark}**---with no or minimal casualties" (772).
Problematically then, the reliance on simulated and abstract warfare is
the "direct introduction of unreality by military bureaucrats" that
generates a version of war that does little to recognize the human
combatants and violence on either side and instead creates a
near-impenetrable cloud wherein an outside observer (civilian, military)
can't begin to differentiate between "real" and "unreal" (De Landa 101).
Within the book Virtuous War, Der Derian argues that "at the strategic
level, simulations and substitutions proliferate with plug-and-play
worst-case scenarios; on the battlefeld, the enemy soldier becomes an
electronically signifed 'target of opportunity' ... that much easier to
disappear" (121).Within this virtuous warfare of disappearing enemies,
De Landa adds that "there is a blurring of the differences between
simulation and reality. All the stimuli from the radar and computer
screens remain identical" (101). This "post-corporeal"
**[warfare]{.underline}** [digitizes the enemy into]{.underline} a
"**[target of opportunity]{.underline}**," and Coker further warns that
"if war is becoming increasingly digitized, if the enemy on a screen is
reconstituted as pure 'data,' then the embodied state of war that we
have taken for granted ... may rapidly diminish in our imagination"
(123) until "**[war itself was nothing but an exercise in
management]{.underline}** ... a game of skill" (van Creveld Technology
and War 245) and, fnally, "cast in terms of input-output and cost
effectiveness" (246). Within this virtuous warfare, an enemy is rendered
so unfamiliar that, Baudrillard warns, a [[military "cannot imagine the
Other]{.mark}, nor therefore personally make war upon it"]{.underline}
(37), [[thereby justifying the use of]{.underline}]{.mark} distanced and
abstract tactics and **[[weaponry]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[If the enemy
is then reconstituted and distanced as data]{.underline}]{.mark}, then
the role and concerns of the civilian and the soldier within the Total
and State War Machines necessarily change as well. This datafying via
the use of computers, wargames and drone strikes often co-opts the
civilian into the State War Machine: in such a war game, humans were
increasingly "taken out of the loop" (De Landa 99) and "games and
simulations mutated from an experimental role designed to elicit
insights in the participants to an institutionalized productive role,
transforming civilians into military planners" (102). This aligns with
Coker's worries that the nature of a soldier has changed deeply, from a
warrior that respects the enemy and the confict with which he/ she is
engaged, into a "cubicle warrior," a process by which "the warrior has
been transformed into a technician and war into a routine ... a series
of more or less routine tasks" (118). Speaking about contemporary bomber
pilots and drone operators, he describes this new soldier as "almost
immune from danger ... they \[clock\] up the hours in the sky like
business executives" (120). By training in simulators and being given
orders by authorities that rely on Internet-enabled simulations as
tactics, the killing of enemies, of actual human combatants (and
civilians), becomes a routine and mundane civilian job, fully integrated
into civilian life and landscapes.This chapter will expand on these
thoughts with a discussion of Good Kill and Eye in the Sky, movies that
focus on the "routines" of the technician soldier, the drone pilot.
Unlike the movies discussed in the frst three chapters of this text,
these movies portray a version of the war flm in which the State War
Machine does not rely on visceral and immediately violent
soldier-to-soldier combat, what Basinger would identify as part of the
"infantry" subgenre of the combat flm (20), but generates movies that
are a blend between a Navy flm and an Air Force flm; these movies
combine the Air Force flms' focus on "professionalism ... the problems
men have in the chain of command" with the Navy flms' focus on "the
domestic lives of military men" (author's italics 20). The three flms
make clear that drone usage is a part of what Mead labels as
"asymmetrical warfare," which he clarifes as "battles between
oppositions of vastly different strengths and capabilities" (51);
decisions within such distanced **[[asymmetrical
warfare]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[is controlled by]{.underline}]{.mark}
the **[[navigation of gathered intelligence]{.underline}]{.mark}** on
enemies and a series of game-theory calculations and disembodied
data-driven predictions and simulations. Visually, Eye in the Sky and
Good Kill resemble the submarine war flm rather than the infantry flm,
in that the technician soldiers are held in small "safe" arenas outside
of "combat spaces" (20), watching screens (portals) and the effects of
their weaponry from an enclosed distance, as opposed to engaging in more
"traditional" and bodily combat. In opposition to the present human body
seen in the frst two chapters of this book, in particular in the taking
up of [the]{.underline} hard [technological body]{.underline} of Elysium
and Edge of Tomorrow, within the cinematic portrayals of drone warfare,
the technician soldier emphasizes "situation awareness" via
Internet-enabled technologies that focuses on "system and information
management" (Mead 52), [[using information "to forecast plans and
events" and then]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[execute those attacks
remotely]{.underline}]{.mark}** (51).

#### Sitting down we are confronted with the theatre of war-a spectacle of the simulation- a simulacra of the simulacra that attempts to obscure the non war-the war has already and never had happened. And the ontology of change, chaos, the enemy, and the hero has become purged of its reality, being replaced by repetitions, control, search, blackmails, and hostages. Welcome, to the virtual.

**I. Introduction** One of the primary questions I would like to pose in
my article is the question about the "place" of war. What does it mean
that a certain war "did not take place"? What does it mean that the war
"takes place" (*a lieu*)? Does it have "a proper place"? Or maybe -- if
it "does not take place" -- it is subject to some kind of
"displacement"? Moreover, the French and English verbs suggest that
taking place (*avoir lieu*) does also signify the action of arriving,
producing, happening, coming etc. If that was not enough, there is a
clear and visible contradiction in the oxymoronic title Baudrillard have
chosen for his book: *The Gulf War did not take place* (*La Guerre du
Golfe n'a pas eu lieu*). Look carefully: the place of war -- that is
"the Gulf" -- is already properly defined, but at the same time it is
being negated, because the war "did not take place". And if the place of
war is here subjected to negation, it means that this place is only
simulated, produced, because it is displaced by and through the
information network, media and language itself. In the first part of my
article I am trying to depict and underline the significance of the
antithesis inscribed in the title of Baudrillards book *The gulf war did
not take place*. My main focus here is the idiomatic expression and the
variety of possible meanings it produces in both English and French. I
believe this analysis brings us closer to understanding how Baudrillard
plays with the notion of war in the title of his book. The second part
focuses on the idiomatic meanings of German "*stattfinden*", the
counterpart of the English "take place" to show that Baudrillard's title
could be read as "The Gulf war did not *find* its place" using the
original Clausewitz language. Here I am also trying to show that,
despite the fact that Baudrillard omits this problematic in his book, it
philosophically answers the question of why the war degenerates (compare
to Baudrillard 1995: 24). In the third part I am analyzing the etymology
of the word "war" to show that Baudrillards position is closely related
to the displacement of meaning attributed to this notion. I am trying to
establish a link between the ancient meanings of war and Baudrillards
negation of the Gulf war by showing that his and also Clausewitz'
thinking is closer to the "barbarian" understanding of war as a duel,
reciprocal relation and something that can be exchanged, offered etc. I
believe that this is the key to understanding why Baudrillard rejects
the simulation model of "clean" war. I conclude my article by pointing
to the fact that Baudrillards reflection about the displacement of war
leads us to the auto-immunological discourse and that his logic of
thinking war and about war challenges our visions of the Global or World
Order. I am not developing this reflection further as I have written on
the problem of auto-immune in Baudrillard in other places (Klosinski
2012). **II. The proper place of war** Neither Sun Zi in his brief *Art
of War* nor Clausewitz in his long treaty *On War*, write on the problem
of the place of war. They do however engage in some insightful analysis
of different types of terrain and the specificity of engagement itself.
On the one hand Sun Zi focuses on terrain and the methods the general
should choose according to its types: *We may distinguish six kinds of
terrain...(1) Accessible ground; (2) entangling ground; (3) temporizing
ground; (4) narrow passes; (5) precipitous heights; (6) positions at a
great distance from the enemy.../...The art of war recognizes nine
varieties of ground: (1) Dispersive ground; (2) facile ground; (3)
contentious ground; (4) open ground; (5) ground of intersecting
highways; (6) serious ground; (7) difficult ground; (8) hemmed-in
ground; (9) desperate ground (Sun Zi, 1910: 24, 26).* On the other hand,
Clausewitz who writes extensively about the strategic advantages of
terrain (swamp, mountains, forests, country etc.), also points to the
fact that the engagements themselves can be divided into those that
"take place" and those that are "offered": *One may admit that even
where the decision has been bloodless, it was determined in the last
analysis by engagements that did not take place but had merely been
offered. In that case, it will be argued, the strategic planning of
these engagements, rather than the tactical decision, should be
considered the operative principle (Clausewitz 2007: 179).* Clausewitz
sees the difference between the actual battle, or the engagement/war
"taking place" and the one that constitutes an "offering", a situation
where the sheer presence of power is enough to end the conflict without
bloodshed. To be precise here and to avoid further misunderstandings,
the war in the Persian Gulf that Baudrillard tackles with in his book
*The Gulf War did not take place*, is without question a war that took
place if seen through the previous discussion in Sun Zi and Clausewitz.
It was an engagement and it was prepared and executed according to the
specific methodology of terrain, economy etc. So, how is it possible
that Baudrillard -- definitely not a theorist of war -- constructs his
argumentation about the Gulf War on the oxymoronic and such antithetic
sentences as: *The Gulf War did not take place*, *The Gulf War will not
take place* and a question: *The Gulf War: is it really taking place?*
One might try to interpret these titles according to the division
between reality and virtuality, to show that the Gulf War was a kind of
spectacle, a simulation, that its scene, its theatre of engagement has
been displaced -- from the actual battlefield to the screen. Gary
Genosko wrote that: *the passage from the virtual to the real was
stalled in the excess of preprogramming, scenario-heaviness, over
processing of plans, and the war itself was deferred and its place taken
from it **[(it wasn't that the war did not take place but that it did
not have a place)]{.mark} (Genosko** 2004).* Genosko already plays on
the idiomatic expression: "to take place" to show that the
[virtualization of war]{.mark} "defers" it, delays its coming, postpones
it, "[takes its place from it"]{.mark}. Alan Shapiro pointed me to the
title of Maurice Merleau-Ponty's essay 'The war has taken place' written
in June 1945, which seems to be the main intertext to Baudrillard's
title. **[In Merleau-Ponty's text the [war "taking place]{.mark}" is the
starting point, an opening phrase which enables him to [stress the
importance of]{.mark} ideological and historical turmoil,
[change]{.mark}s in thinking about the world and reality of war and its
inevitable escalation]{.underline}** (Merleau-Ponty 2007: 41). War takes
place as it shakes the fabric of the world, makes us re-think the
relation between self and other, re-think various philosophies and
philosophers with the positions they take (Merleau-Ponty mentions Plato
and Heidegger). The war has taken place is also an essay on the role of
Marxism in thinking about war, Nazism and fascism with its notions of
class-struggle, history etc. But nowhere in his text does Merleau-Ponty
mention why he chose this and not the other title. It is obvious that
the catchphrase "[**the war has taken place" said at the end of the
second World War is both a call to re-think something that cannot be
undone and a way to mark the specific time and place after the war -- a
time of re-thinking: philosophy, humanism, ethics, history, economy,
anti-Semitism etc**.]{.underline} It is also a call, a sentence **[said
by [someone who tells]{.mark} us [about his own war experiences]{.mark},
about the time he was a soldier, a time of killing, distinguishing
friend from foe and a time of occupation. And [this war that "has taken
place]{.mark}" here, in Merleau-Ponty's text [is the sum of something
that cannot be forgotten]{.mark}, is a sum of conflicts produced in the
world and by the world he lived in and survived through.(be actually
expierenced this war, and it is a sort of living memory)]{.underline}**
Baudrillard's *The Gulf War did not take place* is a very definite
negation of this "taking place" understood as actualizing in experience
an impulse to re-think war. While Merleau-Ponty is building his
narration about the changes in his world, in his friends thinking[,
**[Baudrillard]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[clearly [engages in the only
thing he can]{.mark} engage -- in the media spectacle, in the images,
fillers, propaganda, illusions and [simulations of war]{.mark} which is
[a new type of mediatized experience.(]{.mark}expierene has fundementall
changed in nature)]{.underline}** Merleau-Ponty writes from the heart of
war, a war that has literally taken his place, his world, which has
decided that one person lives and another dies, while Baudrillard is
writing from our position, the position of the spectators watching
"intelligent" missiles on TV. That is why the title of his book cannot
be any more accurate in this matter, [as it is both a different type of
experience and **[it does not make us re-think
anything]{.mark}.**]{.underline} [Moreover, what Baudrillard shows us is
that the new type of **[non-war is made precisely not to make us
re-think anything with its pre-planning]{.mark}**, intelligent missiles,
perfect strategies etc., **[it does not "take place" as a challenge to
our humanism]{.mark}**]{.underline}, to our philosophy.To further this
analysis I propose to "unpack" Baudrillards oxymoronic, aporetic
sentence about the Gulf War, not only to look at the dialectic of the
virtual and the real that it projects, but also to present a hermeneutic
reading of the Baudrillardean antithesis. But first we have to write
this sentence down, present it as an antithesis: The Gulf War did not
take place. But the Gulf itself is the place, a specific, geographically
certain , "real" place. Let's transform the sentence according to this
knowledge: The War in a specific and real place did not take place. The
antithesis is contradictory because of the detail Baudrillard plays
with, namely that war, and especially Gulf War, has the place appointed
already inside its name, in its definition. So, the place of war has
already been marked in the act of naming that particular and singular
war. We must not forget that the specific place oriented nomenclature
constitutes almost every XX century (and earlier) conflict including two
World Wars, where the place extends from the partial and geographic
region to the "World". The "World" here means "without boundaries", not
limited to a specific region, everywhere. But the most important aspect
of this mechanism of "emplacement" is that it is the defining attribute
of every conflict. Through the antithesis: "[**[The Gulf War did not
take place]{.mark}"** Baudrillard not only **[deconstructs the idea of
singular wa]{.mark}r**, the slogan that "the war takes place", the
doubling of information, the repetition at the core of naming a certain
conflict. We must **[also understand]{.mark}** that the phrase "**[to
take place]{.mark}**" \[*avoir lieu*\] means not only "to happen", but
also: to arrive, literally: to produce (itself), to come: "Avoir lieu,
se produire, arriver en un endroit et à un moment donnés (...)"
(Larousse Dictionaire Francaise). These meanings are important to our
interpretation of war taking place, because they point to the fact, that
war is waged to actually take a certain place, so often to occupy that
place, **[to arrive at a certain destination, to produce certain
results, or to produce itself.]{.mark}**]{.underline} The French
definition of this idiom is a bit broader as the English dictionary does
not point to these meanings: "When something takes place, it happens,
especially in a controlled or organized way or as a result of something.
EG The next attack took place four hours later" (Collins English
Language Dictionary). The English thesaurus is a bit more generous:
"Take place = happen, occur, go on, go down (US & Canadian), arise, come
about, crop up, transpire (informal), befall, materialize, come to pass
(archaic), betide" (Collins English Thesaurus). What is really
interesting about this idiomatic expression in both French and English,
is that it utilizes the action of "taking place" to speak about the time
of an event, the time of occurrence, happening, and by doing so, it
assures us, by locating the event "in place", that it was real. **III.
Searching for the place** In spite of these definitions it might be
interesting to look at the passage about the engagement in Clausewitz
once more, as he uses the word "stattfanden" (translated as 'take
place') which has the verb 'finden' (to find) and the noun 'die statt'
(place) at its root. What English and French call "taking place", the
German language describes literally as **["[finding
place",]{.underline}]{.mark}** [and -- as trivial as it may sound -- to
find does not mean the same thing as to take. The action of finding
place presupposes that the [war]{.mark} or engagement has no proper
place but [is in constant search for it, **that the place is not a given
of war**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Furthermore, finding does not imply
possessing while taking does, so in Clausewitz the [**[engagement does
not possess a certain place]{.underline}**,]{.mark} it merely finds it
suitable for combat, whilst in French and English the place is to be
overwhelmed and possessed, it is to be taken. But the difference between
find place and take place also applies to the way that these idioms
produce meaning: war finds a suitable place for itself or war possesses
a place for its own needs; war searches and finds, war takes and holds,
war does not have a place, war has a specific place. This idiomatic
research leads us to the sentence by Genosko quoted earlier: "(it wasn't
that the war did not take place but that it did not have a
place)"(Genosko 2004). Genosko gives us a hint that a Baudrillardean
reflection about the Gulf War might be exactly the problem of thinking
about the engagement as both: finding place, and taking place. What if
we rewrite the title of Baudrillard's book according to the German
*stattfinden*: ["The Gulf War did not find place"?]{.underline} The
question now is a philosophical one: what happens when and if the war
does not find its place? And Baudrillard answers clearly: ["**[Non-war
is characterized by]{.mark}** that degenerate form of war which includes
**hostage manipulation and negotiation**"]{.underline} (Baudrillard
1995: 24). [The [war]{.mark} degenerates, it [searches for]{.mark} the
ones who could **fulfill the roles of the [warriors]{.mark}** [**but it
finds only hostages**]{.mark}, [it searches for agonistic **conflict and
challenge** but it **finds only negotiators and
blackmail**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} If Baudrillard quoted some of the
passages on the engagement from Clausewitz, he would have probably
written extensively about the engagement that did not take place but
"was merely offered", instead, he depicts the effects of a degenerate
war on the spectators: ["Along with the spectacle of these prisoners or
these hostages, **[the screens offer us the spectacle of our
powerlessness]{.mark}**"]{.underline} (Ibid.: 39).[In Clausewitz, the
power play offered during the engagement that does not end in battle is
positive -- one side has acknowledged the power of the adversary and
withdrawn from battle: [the duel of prestige and power ended without
bloodshed]{.mark}. But this is not the case in the Gulf War as
Baudrillard perfectly knows that there can be no display of power from
this side of the TV screen that our **[powerlessness comes from the
position we]{.mark}**, the terrorists and the hostages **[have been
given by the degenerate state of war. The war did not find its place and
it haunts us precisely because of this
displacement]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Baudrillard relates to Clausewitz
twice in *The Gulf War did not take place*: "Promotional, speculative,
virtual: this war no longer corresponds to Clausewitz's formula of
politics pursued by other means, it rather amounts to *the absence of
politics pursued by other means*" (Ibid.: 30): "[A variant on
Clausewitz: *non-war is the absence of politics pursued by other
means*... It [no longer proceeds from a political will to
dominate]{.mark} or from a vital impulsion or an antagonistic violence,
[but from the **will to impose a general consensus by
deterrence**]{.mark}"]{.underline} (Ibid.: 83). Clearly Baudrillard
wants to overturn the famous Clausewitz statement that the war is
politics pursued by other means, which gives us a hint about
[one]{.mark} of the [possible places the war should have taken, namely:
the place of politics]{.mark}. If the Gulf War did not take the place of
politics, then the logical conclusion is that neither politics nor war
actually took place. But Baudrillard totally omits two most important
features of engagement in Clausewitz: the "offering" and the
"stattfinden". However, my aim is to illustrate how they relate to his
theory. By his antithesis Baudrillard states that the [[Gulf War did
not]{.mark} take "its" place, did [not arrive]{.mark} [at]{.mark} "its"
destination -- namely, [the Gulf]{.mark}. Moreover, we now know that
[its destination]{.mark} -- altogether with the whole aura of war --
[was displaced]{.mark}, that it arrived, was produced, and brought [to
our TV screens]{.mark}. Ironically, the ["theatre of war" quite
literally turned into a theatre]{.mark}, a "live show" that was
constantly being broadcast.]{.underline} The displacement and aporia of
the Gulf War has been poetically deconstructed by Baudrillard, as he --
providing his book with the oxymoronic title -- reversed meanings and
articulated the inner conflict of the idea of war and it's execution. In
his introduction to the book Paul Patton states that: *Rather, it means
that state-of-the-art military power is now virtual in the sense that it
is deployed in an abstract, electronic and informational space, and in
the sense that its primary mechanism is no longer the use of force.
[Virtual war is therefore not simply the image or imaginary
representation of real war, but a]{.underline} **[[qualitatively
different kind of war, the effects of which include the suppression of
war in the old sense]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Patton in Baudrillard 1995:
9)* The proper place of war is indeed inscribed in the war itself, but
it has to be suppressed the contemporary media and the contemporary
generals know that there is much more profit in displacing war, in
producing it on the screen, in making the screen its "proper" place. But
Patton also tells us that it is the **["[military power]{.mark}" which
[turns to the informational warfare]{.mark} [rather than the use of
sheer force]{.mark}. Following this line of thinking one could say, that
the [current strategy is to re-place war with its
simulacrum]{.mark}]{.underline}** and that simulacrum of war is
introduced and produced in place of the war. This is of course the
obvious interpretation which Baudrillard already provided us with .

#### The world is conditioned by the will to transparency's desire for auto-immunization against the other from the self expanded Global Order who generates fractal warfare, in which the scattering of forces makes war everywhere yet precisely nowhere- for war has been robbed of meaning, and thus necessitates on being rescued by Spectacles role in organizing reality. The place of war has no place for politics rather it is the Spectacle-alive and running.

IV\. War as a displacement That is why we have to ask about the war
itself, the war in its proper sense. And simultaneously to ask about the
war as a consequence of displacement of meaning and sense. And to do so
we have to look at the displacement of the word itself. Both English
[['war']{.underline}]{.mark} and French '*guerre*' are already displaced
names, alternatives created by the Francs and Germanic tribes who
developed them to replace the Latin '*bellum*', which sounded too much
like the neuter form of the adjective '*bellus*' (beautiful, pretty):
"\[...\] late Old English (c.1050), *wyrre*, *werre*, from Old North
French *werre* «war» (Modern French *guerre*), from Frankish \**werra*,
from Proto-Germanic \**werso* (cf. Old Saxon *werran*, Old High German
*werran*, German *verwirren* "to confuse, perplex"). Cognates suggest
the [[original sense was "to bring into confusion".]{.underline}]{.mark}
Spanish, Portuguese, and Italian guerra are from the same source;
Romanic peoples turned to Germanic for a word to avoid Latin *bellum*
because its form tended to merge with *bello-* «beautiful.» There was no
common Germanic word for «war» at the dawn of historical times. Old
English had many poetic words for «war» (*wig*, *guð*, *heaðo*, *hild*,
all common in personal names), but the usual one to translate Latin
bellum was *gewin* «struggle, strife» (related to win). This etymology
is, surprisingly, pointing towards the strong need to distinguish (both
in meaning and sound) between something beautiful and something harsh.
Both French '*guerre*' and Germanic '*warrum*' seem to replace the
lateral alveolar phoneme 'l' with alveolar approximant 'r' which --
along other significant changes in pronunciation -- displace war from
the domain of clean and soft sounding Latin into rattling and harsh
"barbarian" register. Listen carefully, as this double 'r' happens to
strike the same tune in *warrum* as in the *barbaros* -- the latter word
was used by Greeks and Romans to distinguish someone who did not speak
their language. Moreover, to wage [[war is]{.mark} -- according [to the
root]{.mark} of the word, [to "bring into confusion]{.mark}". Here we
have [the second contradiction]{.mark} pointed out by the etymology and
described by Baudrillard in *The Gulf War did not take place*: the war
produces confusion, chaos, disorder and we should be sensitive to every
attempt at presenting it [as a perfectly planned and precisely executed
endeavor]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} But there is even more in the
etymology of war then meets the eye and something that brings us closer
to Baudrillard. The Latin *bellum* was in fact a replacement for an even
more ancient word, *duellum*: *1590s (from late 13c. in Latin form),
from Medieval Latin duellum "combat between two persons", by association
with Latin duo "two", but originally from Latin duellum "war", an Old
Latin form of bellum (see bellicose). Retained in poetic and archaic
language and apparently given a special meaning in Medieval or Late
Latin of «one-on-one combat» on fancied connection with duo "two".* At
this point we can start our re-reading of Baudrillard and Clausewitz, as
the ancient *duellum* and the "engagement that has merely been offered"
seem to be exactly what Baudrillard is searching for in his reflection
about war. Firstly, because the duel seems to be as close as it can get
to the ritualistic and symbolic realization of agonistic, reversible and
reciprocal relationship built upon challenge (and Baudrillard stresses
the strength of these in many places (Coulter, 2012: 51-78). Secondly,
because the "mere offering" of an engagement relates to the mechanism of
seduction, potlatch and power play which also assumes the reversibility
of positions (Baudrillard, 2007:52). What I am trying to show here is
that war, described and interpreted by Baudrillard, somehow contradicts
this ancient displacements, because -- as he shows us -- the Gulf War
had to be beautiful, colorful, taken from a good angle and clean, clear,
visible -- bellum. The Gulf War should be renamed to Gulf Bellum. And
Baudrillard opposes the bellum, just as the barbarians did, because he
opposes the idea of clean war, an idea that war is no longer a
confrontation, an agonistic encounter. The place of war is precisely in
that roaring *warrum*/*guerre*, in the reciprocal *duellum*,not on the
screen in High definition. That's why he writes that: ["[At the desired
place (the Gulf), nothing took place, non-war. At the desired place (TV,
information), nothing took place, no images, nothing but
filler]{.underline}]{.mark}["]{.underline} (Baudrillard 1995: 82). The
displacement of war happened along with the displacement of information
(fillers instead of facts), so that neither war, nor information took
place, arrived at its destination. [This is the paradoxical effect of
the virtual war, informational warfare -- that neither war nor
information "takes its place", [nothing is what it seems to be.]{.mark}
This interpretation is based on the principle of reversibility and
Baudrillard quotes Brecht to legitimize the argument, that [the war not
taking place is in fact a sign of a New World Order]{.mark} (Ibid.: 83),
[a global]{.mark} one]{.underline}. This is the point where he actually
defines the displacement of war and shows that the [problem of the place
of war is]{.mark} not only the problem of its emplacement, but rather of
[its dissemination, dispersion and fractalisation]{.mark}. In *The
Spirit of Terrorism* Baudrillard describes this process along with the
idea of a [single world order]{.mark} -- a product of the three World
Wars (the First-, the Second-, and the Cold War): [With each succeeding
war, we have moved further towards a single world order. Today that
order, which has virtually reached its culmination, finds itself
grappling with the antagonistic forces scattered throughout the very
heartlands of the global, in all the current convulsions. A [fractal war
of all cells, all singularities, revolting in the form of
antibodies]{.mark}. A confrontation so [impossible to pin down that the
idea of war has to be rescued from time to time]{.mark} by spectacular
set-pieces, such as the Gulf War or the war in Afghanistan. But the
Fourth World War is elsewhere. It is what haunts every world order, all
hegemonic domination -- if Islam dominated the world, terrorism would
rise against Islam, for it is the world, the globe itself, which resists
globalization (Baudrillard 2002: 11-12[).]{.mark} Let's ask again --
after reading this long quote -- what is the place of war? Baudrillard
deconstructs it: war disperses into the cellular war, fractal war at the
lowest structural level and, at the same time, its place is designated
as the World, as the Globe -- the highest structural leve. This is
another antithesis: the war takes place in a place impossible to "pin
down", at the level where it can no longer be defined, described as a
[war]{.mark} and, at the same time, it [happens everywhere]{.mark}. And
lets remind ourselves, that Baudrillard himself says that if something
is everywhere, [than it is nowhere at al]{.mark}that is the main
principle of transesthetics, transpolitics and transsexuality. Now we
can officially add [trans-warfare]{.mark} to this list. When the war
becomes a [fracta]{.mark}l [war]{.mark}, then its proper place [is the
replicating code, the formula which metonymically actualizes itself as
the law governing the world]{.mark}]{.underline}(when wats . Where is
the war? What place has it taken? Baudrillard seems to say that it is
everywhere. Or, if it is everywhere therefore nowhere it is possible to
find it "at its own place". [As a result, [if there is a Fourth World
War, it must be the world itself being the proper place of war, being at
war against the idea of The World O]{.mark}rder]{.underline}. The Fourth
World War is elsewhere because it takes the exact position the
nomenclature gives it, it is no longer a World War "in" the World, on
the Globe, but a World War against the World, against the Globe. [In
this sense it is no longer a war, it is the only possible war in spite
of all the scandalous distractions offered to divert our attention from
the conflict of Order and the World This logic presented by Baudrillard
allows us to look at the problem of the place of war from an
[auto-immunological]{.mark} perspective. The trans-warfare and the
struggle to introduce the New World Order is the proper name of the war
against difference, against the other/Other[, the war that searches for
those who are not yet the part of the global and to either subdue them
or crush them and incorporate their remains in the
homogenous]{.mark}]{.underline}. Baudrillard's description of this
phenomenon of war is no different than his analysis of the famous "Boy
in the Bubble" (Baudrillard 1993: 61), as the war with the world is the
exact state the child is in with the environment -- thus the protective
cosmonaut-like suit (or the bubble). Absolute isolation through the
unification of the world is just the paradoxical reversal of the "bubble
child" situation: the world itself is trying to construct a giant bubble
protecting it from terrorists, rogues, outlaws, Islam etc. That is why
the war is metaphorically displaced and presented as a: "A fractal war
of all cells, all singularities, revolting in the form of antibodies."
We are at war with ourselves; our bodies are at the state of conflict
induced by their own homogeneity. Baudrillard's idea, his theory of the
war against the New World Order is a literary one, a fantastic poetic
and hyperbolic science fiction narration about the biological
interiorization of the place of war. VI. Conclusion I have shown that
Baudrillard's title is a universe of meanings in its own right, that by
engaging it from an etymological and hermeneutic perspective we can see
how he deconstructs the problem of war as a philosophical phenomenon.
The author of *Simulacra and simulation* plays with the idiomatic
expression "to take place" in order to present the Gulf war as an
antithetic and aporetic non-event, a simulacrum produced by the media
and politics. I also wanted to sketch various possible readings of
Baudrillards title: as a displacement of meaning and sense (warrum/
guerre developed from bellum/ duellum), as a challenge to the way we
think about war (it searches and finds place), as an intertextual,
poetic and hyperbolic critique of its degeneration (from challenge, duel
and reciprocal relation into a simulacrum of clean and beautiful
surgical operation). Finally, I wanted to signal (in a hyperbolic way)
that Baudrillards thinking about war is going into the domain of
auto-immunology when he presents the world as the true place of war.

### Warming

#### Maintain the intelligence of mystery or continue the lock-step of the Promethean perspective of unlimited growth that terminates in atmospheric destruction. The desire to make everything signify taints science and causes it to eliminate the very possibility of an ozone as a mysterious zone.

**Baudrillard 10.** Jean Baudrillard, "Ventriloquous Evil" in Carnival
and Cannibal, pg. 70

[In the **Promethean perspective of unlimited growth**, there is not
merely the desire to **make everything function**, to **liberate
everything**, but also the desire **to make everything
signify.**]{.underline}

**[Everything is to be brought under the aegis of meaning (and
reality]{.underline}**). In some cases [we know that knowledge will
forever escape us. But in the immense majority of cases **we do not even
know what has disappeared and has always already eluded
us.**]{.underline}

Now, [**science** makes a systematic effort to **eradicate this secret
area**, this **'constellation of the mystery'** and to **eliminate this
demarcation line** between the violable and the inviolable.]{.underline}

**[All that is concealed must be revealed; everything must be reducible
to analysis]{.underline}**. [Hence the whole effort]{.underline}
(particularly since the death of God, who restrained this attempt to
break open the natural world) [leads to an extension of the field of
meaning]{.underline} (of knowledge, analysis, objectivity and reality).

Now, [**everything inclines us to think that this accumulation**, this
**over-production**, this **proliferation of meaning** constitutes (a
little like **the accumulation of greenhouse gases**) a **virtual threat
for the species** (and for the **planet**), since it is **gradually
destroying, through experimentation, that domain of the inviolable**
that serves us, as it were, as **an ozone layer and protects us from the
worst -- from the lethal irradiation and obliteration of our symbolic
space**]{.underline}.

[Shouldn't we]{.underline} then, **[work precisely in the opposite
direction, to extend the domain of the inviolable]{.underline}**? **[To
restrain the production of meaning the way they are trying to restrain
the production of greenhouse gases, to reinforce that constellation of
mystery and that intangible barrier that serves as a screen against the
welter of information, interaction and universal
exchange.]{.underline}**

**[This countervailing work exists -- it is the work of
thought]{.underline}**. [Not the analytic work of an understanding of
causes, of the dissection of the object-world, not the work of a
critical, enlightened thought, but **another form of understanding or
intelligence, which is the intelligence of mystery**.]{.underline}

### Will to Transparency 

#### The generative point of violence today is the attempt to reduce all geopolitical events to information. Three impacts: (i) the proliferation of information thickens the fog of war, making conflicts more likely; (ii) the pursuit of information at all costs enacts a will to transparency that wages a global war on all singularities; and (iii) the reduction of all events to units of information that can be circulated within a closed system of exchange exhausts the possibility of meaning and value.

Polytechnic, Francois, professor of political science at Virginia

Representation*,\" Baudrillard Studies Vol. 11 No. 2\]

Such an expectation about the ontological "location" of the objects,
subjects, stakes, and processes of today's virulent war is generative of
another expectation: that of the so-called self-evident violence of war
and, by extension, of anything that socially and politically is said to
matter for and about the demos (since virulent/[[virtual war is an
**all-encompassing**]{.mark}, or **all-swarming**, "**[geopolitical
reality]{.mark}**").]{.underline} In other words, [what the so-called
**objects** and **subjects** of today's **virtual**/**virulent** **war**
expect "their" war to represent is what ensures [a **disposition**
**towards violence**]{.mark} (a **violence of "the
global,**"]{.underline} perhaps, as Baudrillard intimates) [[that
may]{.mark} well [be the result of attempts at securing a **will to
meaning**, a will to **make sense** of **things**,]{.mark} and a will to
be of **political objects** and **subjects** that today takes place or,
rather, is **intensified** in **virtual** and **digital modalities** of
**representation** and **mediation**.]{.underline} Part of the critical
stake of this essay is [[to "**locate**" the
violence]{.mark}/**virulence** [of **contemporary warfare** not just
in]{.mark} its empirical [**geopolitical "events,"** but]{.mark} rather
[in the **representational domain** inside which those]{.mark} so-called
[events are **expected** to **make sense**]{.mark}**,** that is to say,
[in the always already **preemptively belligerent** and **aggressive**
realm of **representation**]{.mark} (where the challenge is [to
**produce** and **impose** **meaning** at all
costs]{.mark}).]{.underline} II. The Fog of War [The claim about a
**certain quality** of **reality**]{.underline} or even realism to new
digital informational or communicative technologies [has played a
**formative role** in the global staging of several **recent social**
and **political conflicts**.]{.underline} In both the Arab Spring and
the Occupy movements of 2011, for example, digital technologies were
celebrated for their real-time capacity and their subversive
(democratic) potentials. The virtue of reporting "from the ground" of
the event itself was championed as a matter of authenticity. [There was
a common sense that "**truth**" would finally be able to speak from its
"**real" source** (the demos itself?). Not only is there a prevalent
uncritical (even if sometimes well-intentioned) **faith** in **new
media** and their **digital technologies** today, but, more importantly,
there is often an **impulse of** **liberation**. Yet, this impulse is
stifled by its **faith in representation**. [The hope for]{.mark}
**openness**, **[transparency]{.mark}**, **immediacy**, and indeed
**liberation** is so tethered to the **real** (and to the will to
reality) that it [ends up being]{.mark} **negative** or, at least,
**[self-defeating]{.mark}**.]{.underline} It often becomes evident that
the so-called democratic uses of new media technologies---particularly
in terms of reporting violent war events or conflicts of allegedly great
concern/importance to the global demos---are, [far from producing a
**clearer picture** of an objective event, [contributing to an ever
**thickening fog** of **meaning**]{.mark} and **truth**.]{.underline}
These new media technologies in and of themselves are not the object of
our critique here. Moreover, [we are not interested in "**clearing the
fog**" of the **real** or **war**. Again, our critical intervention in
this essay has more to do with deploying perspectives that may expose
the **violent dispositions** of the **contemporary mythos** of **war**
(and revealing the **complicit role** of the digitalized demos in the
**intensification** of this mythos) than with attempting to clear the
way for a different ethos about **everyday reality**, digitalized
**media**, and the **prevalence** of **warfare** in **political
representations**.]{.underline} In fact, part of our argument is also to
suggest that [[the various]{.mark} cultural, [political, and ethical
mechanisms that seek to **clear the fog** of the real (and war)]{.mark}
often [end up **reproducing it.**]{.mark} The lure to **criticize** and
**debunk reality** often requires that **another real**, another
**certainty**, another **dominant meaning**, or indeed another
democratic necessity be established through the same **means** and
**techniques**, and media, that had to be challenged in the first place
(thus, the simulacrum **continues to proliferate** its reality-effects).
**[Behind the widespread "global" celebration of digitalized
technologies for their newly found representational capabilities and
accuracies, there lies the idea that,]{.mark}**]{.underline} perhaps
following a collective disgust with the dealings of Western media
outlets as more or less uncritical props for the social/economic/ethical
status quo in the past several decades, **[[disseminated and
"democratized" media technologies can de-mystify the world,]{.mark}
l]{.underline}**ift its aura in a way, or perhaps "dig deeper" into the
"truth" than, say, what the media networks involved in reporting news
(including war news) in the 1980s and 1990's (the famous CNN effect)
ever could do. Because [these technologies are far more in real-time
than news networks, they are also generally thought to be able to evade
**oppressive**/**repressive** censorship of particular
corporate/class/state/ideology interests. But even more than escaping
filters, [**digital representations** today are often thought to be able
to **eliminate** all of the **ambiguities**]{.mark} born of time. Thus,
we (members of the public/demos) want to believe that **mediation** can
be **removed**. And [we want to subscribe to the view that any
**distortion** occurring between an event and its
perception/]{.mark}memory, or between the "**actual**" and its
**account**, [can **evaporate**.]{.mark} By reducing to the
**virtually** **infinitesimal** or invisible the filter/screen between
the **image** that represents and the real that is and, **furthermore**,
by placing the **productive responsibilities** for the image into the
hands of the **user** (literally into the digits), the digital
establishes itself as **something capable** of demolishing the
"**malicious**" surface of appearances to reveal a **meaningful**
**density** of **truth**]{.underline} through the quasi-immediate
interface. This is the dream of immediacy rediscovered and perhaps
finally realized. At a most basic level of analysis, the risk involved
in pointing to this desire for mediatized or digitalized immediacy would
be to undermine the visual evidence of the violent/virulent occurrence
of the omnipresence of war. For example, could we have deployed a
critique of the US military's and the US government's use of torture in
the War on Terror were it not for the seemingly unfiltered "shock and
awe" of the Abu Ghraib photos? Again, from the point of view of the
ethos of virtual/virulent war, the lure of digitalized immediacy has its
uses (and, possibly, benefits, too, even for the demos). But, from the
perspective of war's mythos, it must be said that [[the "**truth**"
about **war**]{.mark} and war operations [cannot be **fully revealed**
because **representation**]{.mark}, no matter how **immediate** or
seemingly **unmediated**, [always works by imposing some **meaning**
onto things]{.mark}/events that are made
**visible/representable**.]{.underline} Consider the role played by
digital media in the Boston Marathon bombing in April 2013. Within a
matter of minutes of the blasts, even [before the **smoke** could
**clear the scene**, images and videos of terror taken from
**spectators' mobile devices** circulated through **cyberspace**.
Everything was seemingly **captured** in that **instant.** The horror
that drew so many people to **capture images** through their smart
phones seems to **speak** on its **own**; it needs no **commentary**,
**no meaning** to be given to it. In fact, it appears to have no
**mediation**, no **appropriation** or **narrativizing**, no
**contextualizing** either.]{.underline} That is precisely why smart
phones are so apt at giving us such images, such representations, such
"pure" meanings about things. Especially, such a horrifying violence, it
is said, needs no commentary, no sense to be made of it. [An
[**immeasurable violence** is done to the violated when one tries to
**make sense** of the **senseless**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Agamben,
1999). Yet, as Baudrillard had already pointed out in his remarks on the
Gulf War, "[[everything]{.mark} which is [**turned into information**
becomes]{.mark} the **object** of **endless speculation,** [the site of
**total uncertainty**. We are left with the **symptomatic reading**
on]{.mark} our [screens]{.mark} of the effects of the war, or the
effects of **discourse** about the **war**, or completely **speculative
strategic evaluations**]{.underline}" (Baudrillard, 1995: 41). [In their
**digital representation**, images of [**war** and]{.mark} images of
[**terror**]{.mark} are [dissolve]{.mark}d [into]{.mark} their **own
[information]{.mark}**. Information (what the image/event wants to tell
us, to reveal, allegedly) already **infiltrates** the tweeted or texted
**image**/scene (of **horror**, of **war**) with an urgency of
**signification** and **meaning**.]{.underline} [Images of horror
**cannot make sense**, perhaps must not be made sense of, and yet they
somehow **beg for meaning**, for circulation, or for **propagation**, in
the hope that they may **reveal something** to **someone**.]{.underline}
Thus, the digitalized mediation of the image, even in its instantaneity,
still takes place. [Images---or whatever event might have been
"caught"---must succumb to a **will to information**, to a will to
**meaning**, even if it is **falsely affirmed** that what is digitally
rendered needs no **commentary**]{.underline}. Put differently, [[the
image **levels the event** it represents by entering into]{.mark} a
mass/**global** [**indifferent** **exchange**]{.mark}, into a virulent
**global** (representational) **circulation** [that **murders
singularity**]{.mark}]{.underline} or, indeed, the moment of trauma (on
this question of the erasure of trauma, see Debrix, 2008: 4-5; Edkins,
2003: 37-38). [The **enigmatic singularity** of the event---which, for
Baudrillard, was once a **precondition** for any sort of **historical
transition**---gives way to an **endlessness** of **representation**,
whether such representation appears to have a clear **ethical** or
political **purpose**/**signification** or not.]{.underline} [It is in
this always **operative tendency** of rendered appearances to **yield
meaning** (even if their meaning is to be **information-worthy)**, not
in the image or event itself, that we situate the **conditions** of
**possibility** and **reproducibility** for the ever-thickening
**representational fog** and for the **violence**/virulence of
**images**, or better yet, of **appearances**. [To make war]{.mark} or,
as the case may be, the terror event **[mean something]{.mark}**---even
in some of the most immediate reactions often designed to evoke
injustice or, indeed, incomprehension---[is the **generative point of
violence**]{.mark}, the **source** of **representation** as a
**virulent**/virtual **code** and **mode of
signification**.]{.underline} Baudrillard writes, "[Everywhere one seeks
to **produce meaning**, to make the world **signify**, to **render it
visible**]{.underline}." He adds, "[[We are not, however, in danger of
**lacking meaning**]{.underline}]{.mark}; \[...\] [[we are **gorged with
meaning**]{.mark} and [it is **killing** **us**]{.mark}]{.underline}"
(Baudrillard, 1988: 63). Indeed, [the **Western world**---increasingly,
the global---has found itself with a **proliferation** of **meanings**
and **significations**]{.underline} in the late 20th and early 21st
centuries.

[It is as if the so-called **crisis of nihilism**]{.underline} (thought
to be characteristic of much critique and philosophical suspicion
throughout the 20th century) **[later on produced something of the
opposite order]{.underline}**. [[The mass violence of the 20th century
inaugurated]{.mark} not a complete void of despair or meaninglessness,
but instead **a flood of meaning, if not an overproduction of
it**]{.underline}. [Baudrillard refers to this **frantic explosion of
meaning/signification** as "**a panic-stricken production of the real**
and the **referential**, above and parallel to **the panic of material
production**]{.underline} \[...\]" (Baudrillard, 1983: 7). Here,
Baudrillard describes a mode of production of a different kind, not
motivated by class interests or exploitation of value, but by an
automated, perhaps viral, abreaction to the empty core or disenchantment
of things and the world: that is to say, [the degree to which things
seem to lack a singular center of gravity or have lost a justifiable
reference to the real world, and yet each thing that "matters" is also
an attempt to get at reality as a question of accumulation (of meaning),
circulation (of signs), and filling up of all interstitial spaces of
communication and value]{.underline}. **[The end result is [an
over-abundance of signs and images of reality]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
something [that culminates in]{.underline} what Baudrillard calls
**[[hyperreality]{.underline}]{.mark}**---**[things appear more real
than reality itself]{.underline}**. The story that needs to be told is
thus not about the undoubtedly deplorable "truth" or fact of explosive
and warlike violence, but about a violence of another sort. [In the
radical digital transparency of the global scene, we (members of the
demos) often have full or direct exposure to explosivity, as we saw
above with the image of terror. But [what still needs to be thought and
problematized is]{.mark}]{.underline} implosivity or what may be called
**[[implosive violence]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Implosive violence is a
violence for which we do not, and perhaps will never, have much of a
language]{.underline} (Rancière, 2007: 123). Although, not having a
language for it or, rather, as we saw above, [seeking to find a language
to talk about it and, perhaps, to make sense of it is still sought
after]{.underline}. [This is]{.underline}, perhaps, [what digital
pictures of war/terror violence seek to capture or want to force
through]{.underline}. [[Implosive violence]{.underline},]{.mark} often
digitally rendered these days, [is in **close contact** with **media
technologies and representational devices** and techniques because it
[seeks **representation and meaning**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is why
[[implosive violence insists on]{.mark} calling in wars (against
terror]{.underline}, for example) [and]{.underline} on [[mobilizing war
machines]{.mark} (against terrorist others, against vague enemy
figures), but wars and war machines [that **no longer
have**]{.mark}---**to the extent that they ever had**---[a **clearly
identifiable object**]{.mark} **and subject**, or a **clear
mission/purpose**]{.underline}. As such, [[this **implosive violence and
its wars**]{.mark} (the **new Western/global way of war**, perhaps)
[must remain]{.mark} **uncertain**, **unclear**, **foggy**, **inwardly
driven**, **representational**, and indeed
**[virulent]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [They **must remain uncertain and
confused** even as they are **digitally operative** and **desperately
capture events/images** [to give the impression that
**meanings**]{.mark}**/significations [can and will be
found]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Yet, as we saw above, **[it is
not meanings exactly that must be found, but information and the endless
guarantee of its immediate circulation]{.underline}**. [As information
occupies the empty place of meaning, certainty, or truth, images must be
**instantaneously turned into appearances** that **search for meanings**
that will **never be discovered** because, instead, a **[proliferation
of information-worthy facts and beliefs will take
over]{.mark}**]{.underline} (**[perhaps this is what US fake pundit and
comedian Stephen Colbert famously referred to as
"truthiness]{.underline}**"). Or, as Baudrillard puts it, "**[free from
its former enemies, [humanity now has to create enemies]{.mark} from
within, which in fact produces a wide variety of inhuman
metastases]{.underline}**" (Baudrillard, 2003). Thus, [this [**implosive
violence** is destined to be **a global violence**]{.mark} since it \"is
the **product of a system [that tracks down any]{.mark} form of
negativity** and **[singularity]{.mark}**, including of course **death**
as the **ultimate form of singularity**]{.underline}. \[...\] [It is a
violence that]{.underline}, in a sense, **[puts an end to violence
itself and strives [to establish a world where]{.mark} anything related
to [the natural must disappear]{.mark}]{.underline}** \[...\] [Better
than a global violence, we should call it a **global
virulence**]{.underline}. **[This form of violence is indeed
viral]{.underline}**. [It moves by contagion, produces by chain
reaction, and little by little it destroys our immune systems and our
capacities to resist]{.underline}\" (2003; our italics).

### Fatal Strategies 

#### **The only strategy left is the fatal strategy -- to be more cynical than cynical in an age that is more real than real. We advocate for the strategy of the object, pursuing the logic internal to systems of domination until they collapse under their own reversibility. We are the silent majority, the Zoom bombers waiting inside the digital labyrinth.** 

**Pettman 8** (Dominic, University Professor of Media and New Humanities
at The New School, "A Belated Invitation to the Orgy" Introduction to
Jean Baudrillard's *Fatal Strategies,* Semiotext(e) pp. 7--22)

[**"Too bad. Were in paradise**.]{.underline}" ---Jean Baudrillard WHEN
I FIRST ENCOUNTERED the writings of Jean Baudrillard, it felt as if I
had discovered the ideal life-coach for an age in which life made very
little sense. His various works appeared as an almost seamless
soliloquy, distributed over, and parceled into, a series of books that
functioned more as chapters in an overarching compendium, than discrete
texts of their own. To step midway into Baudrillard's
stream-of-consciousness, was to treat his compulsively calm commentary
on the present as an illuminating guide for the perplexed. Indeed, few
other thinkers could, to my mind, account for the mystifying "events"
that were claiming the attention of the world at large at the time:
Michael Jackson's unfolding follies, baroque conspiracy theories,
newsless news reports, wars staged for prime-time audiences, and
pseudoscandals which seemed to stimulate debate in direct inverse ratio
to the changes they inspired. To come of age in the late 1980s and early
1990s was to find oneself in a sociopolitical echo chamber, robbed even
of the false promise of revolution, or compensatory hope of utopia. For
Baudrillard had insisted that this was indeed utopia: this lurching
tableaux of strip malls, Sony Walkman-cocooned joggers, terrorist themed
fashion shows, designer painkillers, and poll results, announced with
obscene confidence into hushed clinical waiting rooms. "**[The crisis of
achieved utopia,"]{.underline}** is one of the many names Baudrillard
christened the postmodern world, [**in which we were now obliged to
endure the consequences of getting what we had collectively asked
for**.]{.underline} (The ultra-absorbent utility of Baudrillard's "we,"
however, is something that his critics have rightly questioned.) The
orgy was over. Long live the orgy!

Revisiting Fatal Strategies fifteen years after the initial encounter,
and twenty-five years after it was first published in France, I still
have the sense that I am being introduced to an unclouded and fearless
perspective, intent on breaking the rules of polite discourse by
pointing out the strings, wires, smoke, and mirrors that many of us have
been trained not to notice. Baudrillard's words resonate with those
troubled, inchoate intuitions about the sinister mechanics of the
system, bypassing the rational methods and assumptions of his peers.
(After all, Baudrillard was a sociologist who had little patience with
sociology.) **[The temptation is to simplify the insights contained in
his own countersystem, and interpret the hyperreal condition as a
political conspiracy or localizable menace,]{.underline}** just as the
Wachowski brothers did in their naive homage to the great man, The
Matrix. (As Baudrillard eventually pointed out, The Matrix is the kind
of film the Matrix itself would have made about the Matrix.) **[Rescuing
Baudrillard's ideas from caricature thus becomes a challenging and
important task]{.underline}**, now that he is no longer with us.

One of Baudrillard's final appearances in the US was at the New School
in New York, to deliver a paper entitled simply "Cannibal/ Carnival. A
line of people extended out onto 12th Street and down Sixth Avenue an
hour before the lecture was scheduled to begin. Those walking by were
under the impression a rock concert was imminent, as the auditorium, and
then the overflow room, filled to capacity, forcing disappointed punters
of all ages to be turned away. Clearly Baudrillard's star had not
dimmed, in spite of the ongoing disdain sanctioned by fickle academic
fashions. For while part of this turnout could be explained by a morbid
curiosity to see the last of the living postmodern giants, there was
also a genuine desire to hear his pronouncements on the current
"situation."

But what does it mean to read Baudrillard not only after the orgy, but
after Baudrillard himself---now that his words have sadly ceased
midstream?1 What kind of legacy has he left those who would enter the
remarkably comprehensive and coherent universe of his ideas? Well,
**[perhaps the most significant gift he has bequeathed his readers
is]{.underline}** precisely that: **[a durable map of hyperreality on
the same 1:1 scale as Borges's map of the empire. Where hyperreality
exactly covers the territory of the real, Baudrillard's oeuvre exactly
covers the deterritorialized cartography of the
hyperreal.]{.underline}** In doing so, **[his books function as
sophisticated tools for navigating an age which has leap-frogged
alienation to arrive at pure simulation]{.underline}**.

What's more (and this might seem a strange claim at face value),
**[[Baudrillard has given us hope.]{.mark} Clearly no one could write
with such a poisonous pen unless it was filled with the bile of his own
disillusionments and disappointments.]{.underline}** To call him a
lapsed romantic is much too crude and misleading. However, there is an
aestheticism at work in his ideas---a belief in the potential of
changing course, "if only for the sake of change," that appeals to those
cliche-phobic people who have managed to cut their own beautiful souls
like an umbilical cord. For instance, in reference to wholly pessimistic
readings of his statement that we are living post festum, **[Baudrillard
reminds us that a woman is whispering into the man's ear, "what are you
doing after the orgy?" It is a potential rendezvous, an occasion to look
forward to, and build toward: a slight shift in perspective, which
creates a more promising view of the orgy itself. And so, [by extending
the poetic praxis of the Situationists into his own complex vision
of]{.mark} the enemy]{.underline}** (no longer life-draining Capital,
but [**[the biopolitical logic of the code]{.underline}**), **[we
find]{.underline}** ]{.mark}**[plenty of [room to breathe inside]{.mark}
those same [concepts which impatient]{.mark} and obtuse [readers]{.mark}
simply [dismiss]{.mark} as a litany of negative
epiphanies.]{.underline}**

Another great gift from Baudrillard is his style, which is nothing if
not seductive. His ideas are complex, but fit together perfectly, like a
particularly fiendish Chinese box. And like other great thinkers, he
creates his own vocabulary---often counterintuitive--- where "**[crisis"
stands diametrically opposed to "catastrophe," "ceremony" to
"spectacle," and "domination" to "hegemony."]{.underline}** When reading
several titles in a row, his ideas can seem terribly repetitive. And
yet, his phrasing is so exquisite, his examples so compelling, his
rhetoric so uncompromising, that the diligent reader may feel obliged to
take notes by simply transcribing page for page. (Indeed, were one to
actually take the time to do so, then the strength of the skeleton
supporting the dance comes into sharper relief.)

No work was more important to Baudrillard himself than Fatal Strategies,
and it is indeed one of the best places to start for an overview of his
thought. Here in these pages we find a holographic style; for the entire
vision is contained in each fragment. From whichever unit one might
choose to approach it---the sentence, the paragraph, the chapter, or the
entire book---a crystallized sense of the argument shines through. What
is more, there is a fugue-like persistence at work between the pages: a
Pachelbel's Canon of Genteel Disgust. Despite using academic language,
and assuming some familiarity with the history of ideas, this book is
not at all obscure or precious or esoteric. The author proceeds with the
confidence of someone who has much to say, and wants others to
understand it. To this end, he creates a formidably coherent textual
universe; totalizing, despite---or due to---its reliance on paradox.

Along with Symbolic Exchange and Death, Fatal Strategies is one of
Baudrillard's most emphatic and comprehensive statements.2 Within these
pages we are not only introduced to the key motifs developed in this
earlier book, during his post-Marxist rehab--- reversibility, value,
impossible exchange, the object, transparency, virtuality, chance,
etc.---but we are also witness to the underlying force (destiny/evil)
which holds them together in the same constellation. Having previously
noted that **[[symbolic exchange is "a functioning principle that is
sovereignly external and antagonistic to our economic 'reality
principle'"]{.underline}]{.mark}** (SED, 120), **[Baudrillard goes on to
develop the ecstatic challenge of the "counter-gift" to the restricted
economy.]{.underline}** Namely, that **[[this anthropological specter
cannot be assimilated without damage to the commodity system]{.mark},
based as it is on utility, (re)production, exchange value, and profit.
As a kind of "accursed share," [the symbolic embodies the fatal strategy
of achieving liberation through "the deepening of negative
conditions"]{.mark}]{.underline}** (223). In other words**, [[the
socio-cybernetic code can successfully absorb everything except a
homeopathic dose of its own logic of exclusion.]{.mark} Thus, the
violence of the symbolic---the obligation to reciprocate on levels
deeper than objects tethered to exchange value---haunts the diminished
contemporary world in the way kryptonite haunts Superman.]{.underline}**
The social law would have us believe that time is linear, and that gifts
are unilateral. However, a more profound law invites the cyclical and
the reversible to reenter the frame from which they had been rudely
excluded.

**[[Reversibility]{.mark},]{.underline}** for instance, **[[denotes the
limit point in which all alternative values spasm into their
opposite]{.mark}: such as life and death, good and evil, chance and
fate, male and female, human and inhuman, etc. As such, [reversibility
can]{.mark} also [be considered a strategy emerging from within
any]{.mark} given [arrangement: the immanent potential for
subversion]{.mark} or metamorphosis[.]{.mark}]{.underline}** At the
general level of forms, and according the deeper laws of exchange
mandated by the symbolic, such binary oppositions do not progress in a
linear fashion, according to the dialectics of human history. Rather,
they push each other to the outer limits, the object barrier, of their
own moral values. **[No matter how we moderns strive to charge life with
the positive, and death with the negative, there is "a kind of universal
collusiveness of inseparable forms"]{.underline}** (Pass 16-17) **[that
makes a mockery of our digital desire to sort the quick from the
dead.]{.underline}** As such, the ideal Kantian subject is simply not
qualified to parse a world plagued by third order simulation
technologies**[. [How can one argue rationally against "the malicious
curvature that puts an end to the horizon of
meaning"]{.mark}]{.underline}** (45)? **[[One can't. How can one
definitively decode a code based on signifiers sans signifieds? One
cannot.]{.mark} Thus [every system is pregnant with the possibility that
it will "overflow its own reality principle and \... be refracted in
another logic]{.mark}"]{.underline}** (211).

**[Reality itself, then, is a victim of]{.underline}** what Baudrillard
would later call "**[the perfect crime" (in which perfection itself---or
at least the attempt to achieve perfection---is the criminal). The
hyperreal is not an illusion.]{.underline}** It is not a false world of
Platonic cave shadows, from which one could escape. **[It is the more
real than real.]{.underline}** **[Reality,]{.underline}** as experienced
in the different classical times preceding postmodernism, **[was indexed
against illusion, dreams, art, magic. Today, reality has been swallowed
up and disappears in its own hyperbole, just as sex disappears in porn,
and events in the news. The traditional division between culture and
nature no longer holds in the hyperreal, since both have been so
thoroughly mediated.]{.underline}** Virtual reality is thus both an
oxymoron and a tautology at the same time. For Baudrillard, this calls
for a "pataphysical" perspective: a concept taken from the
proto-Surrealist Alfred Jarry, whose writings promoted the "science of
imaginary solutions": a counterintuitive, ametaphysical, rendering of
ruses, rules, predestinations, and interconnections. In a pataphysical
climate, **[there is no foundation to distinguish between the cosmic and
the political, the real or imagined, so that each infects the other in
unprecedented ways.]{.underline}**

Philosophizing with a Spanner

**[Fatal Strategies can]{.underline}** therefore **[be read as a
perverse manual of conduct]{.underline}**, pointing out common
temptations and traps to avoid. I shall leave the ever-green, ever-vexed
question of the "lived" or practical application of theory aside, and
rather note that **[Baudrillard's playbook initially disorients and then
liberates, as it introduces the reader to a procession of ideas,
blasphemous to both the secular priests of high reason and the
neoromantic revolutionaries of the various "isms" of our
time.]{.underline}**

Inscribed within the title is a paradox and a pun. The paradox involves
the nature of the conjunction, for as Baudrillard himself asks
explicitly in the concluding pages, "how could there be fatality if
there is strategy?" By what "sarcastic variable" could the strategic be
figured as a subspecies of fate, or vice versa? Herein lies the enigma
that powers not only this book, but **[Baudrillard's entire wager of
believing "for a single instant the hypothesis that there is a fatal and
enigmatic bias in the order of things."]{.underline}** To do so [**is to
throw into question all the fixed cultural algorithms the culture has
relied upon to sort "right" from "wrong," and distribute guilt or blame
where necessary: "**We have abolished the real world,"]{.underline}
wrote Nietzsche, ["what world is left? the apparent world perhaps? \...
But no! with the real world we have also abolished the apparent world!
"]{.underline}3 (Nietzsche cast a long and cooling shadow over
Baudrillard's work.)4 The pun embedded in the title, on the other hand,
concerns the duel use of "fatal," meaning primarily fate-as destiny, but
also the symbolically lethal forces described in his earlier works:
Freud's death-drive detourned toward objects and forms, rather than to
biographical beings.

**[[Baudrillard dismisses current critical radicality as
"useless."]{.underline}]{.mark}** Certainly it takes courage to claim
one's own system as the antidote to banality and denounce dialectics as
obsolete. But it isn't just a flippant statement on his part. The
multipolar polemic of Fatal Strategies begins by noting that, "Things
have found a way of avoiding a dialectics of meaning that was beginning
to bore them." In other words, **[[the rhetorical]{.mark} and/or
[revolutionary strategy of opposition is]{.mark} now
[corrupt]{.mark}]{.underline}** and paralyzed, so that **[[it has become
necessary]{.mark}---in an age of rampant indeterminism---[to deepen
negative conditions until they flip,]{.mark} according to the
cultural-cosmic principles or reversibility detailed
throughout.]{.underline}** (A point pushed by Zizek a decade or so
later.) **[[Fatal strategies]{.underline}]{.mark}** themselves differ
from other such techniques, such as Machiavelli's or Sun Tzu's, in that
they **[[are not about securing the sovereignty or prosperity of the
subject, but are deployed by forces enigmatic to us: evil genies, sly
objects, ironic events]{.mark}, and spanners in the works which escape
the centripetal will and best laid plan's of the
individual.]{.underline}**

We are thus witness to "a dizzying over multiplication of formal
qualities." **[All the elements of our world---science, politics,
fashion, love---have become prey to a flabby
[hyperdeterminacy]{.mark}]{.underline}** (which is equivalent to
indeterminacy). **[This in turn [leads to "the frenzy to explain
everything]{.mark},]{.underline}** attribute everything, footnote
everything." **[[Fatal strategies]{.mark}, in contrast, [are those
phenomena that slip away from the harsh light of interrogation, the
presumption of explanation]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,]{.mark} and the
tyranny of causality. Meanwhile, **[[human activity continues to
unfold]{.mark} in a kind of endless extra time, [in which the results
are meaningless, because no one can remember what they are playing
for.]{.mark} "]{.underline}**The worst thing," writes Baudrillard, "is
that there is no Promethean challenge involved here, no excess of
passion or pride. It simply seems that **[the species has crossed some
specific, mysterious point, from which it is impossible to retreat,
decelerate or slow down."]{.underline}** To put it somewhat differently,
**[the audience]{.underline}** collectively feels de trop, yet
**[stubbornly refuses to leave after the credits have
rolled.]{.underline}**

**[[Going back is]{.mark} certainly [not an option. Neither is allowing
things to continue]{.mark}]{.underline}** in their default trajectory.
One difficult question is the degree to which the eponymous fatal
strategies belong to "us" humans (potentially at least), and to what
extent we are merely caught in their logic. **[Take the example of
terrorism]{.underline}**, which had a different tenor during the time of
composition (the most visible form being left-wing extremism such as the
Red Brigade), but nevertheless continues to have the same structural
relationship to the media, the masses, and the State. Baudrillard argues
that **[to take a hostage is to wrench someone from their own fate, so
that they are suspended---"neither dead nor alive." From a "fatal"
perspective, we are all hostages, stripped of our symbolic connection to
death and destiny by the infantile demand for security.]{.underline}**
In a passage which echoes uncannily through the halls of the Guantanamo
Bay and Abu Ghraib, Baudrillard asks: "**[what kind of State would be
capable of dissuading and annihilating all terrorism in the bud? It
would have to arm itself with such terrorism and generalize terror on
every level. If this is the price of security, is everybody deep down
dreaming of this?"]{.underline}**5

[Terrorism is not something Baudrillard advocates on an individual,
pragmatic level. He is certainly not asking his readers to hijack
planes. And yet he understands the symbolic and semiotic conditions
which summoned it into existence. When the drama of alienation gives way
to the melodrama of terrorism, Baudrillard is bold enough to point out
the silver lining.]{.underline} "It is worse than the one that replaces
it, but at least it liberates us from liberal nostalgia and the ruses of
history."

**[[Fatal strategies are beyond human control]{.mark}, since they seem
to be woven into the quantum fabric of the cosmos. That mysterious
would-be holistic entity known as "the world," will]{.underline}**---it
seems---**[continue to use its own diabolical techniques to thwart human
hubris and lack of imagination (]{.underline}**which may or may not
amount to the same thing). For instance**[, the object may only pretend
to obey the laws of physics, "because it gives so much pleasure to the
observer."]{.underline}** Some scientists would probably throw the book
across the room at such a suggestion. The silent majority, however, may
read on intrigued.

**[[On the level of the individual]{.mark} then, [fatal strategies are
secret social tendencies]{.mark} or cosmic ["objective" ironies which
can provide a model for how to approach certain
situations]{.mark}]{.underline}**. One can, for instance, refuse to
treat seduction as a narcissistic game of capture and control (as Don
Juan might), and rather consider it as a way to "soak pleasure from this
charming and absurd difference that nature has put between the sexes."
How successful one might be in replacing the obscene, demanding (and
intrinsically alienating) discourse of love with the subtle, challenging
(and inherently inclusive) challenge of seduction, is no means certain,
given the cultural pressures set up against it. No doubt the stakes are
against such an endeavor, given that the free-floating "ecological
libido" of modern times represents "a product specific to our epoch,
spread out everywhere in homeopathic and homeostatic doses \....
\[which\] can be drained, diverted, magnetized from one niche to
another, according to the flow. It corresponds ideally to an order of
manipulation." And yet, Baudrillard suggests, **[merely registering a
willingness to]{.underline}** change the rules of erotic engagement, to
**[tinker with the semiotic code, and alter the assumptions they rep
resent, has the potential to transform human intimacy beyond the
unthinking form of personal blackmail that it has largely
become.]{.underline}**

**[[On the level of the masses, it matters little what any given
individual seeks to achieve in terms of strategic behavior.]{.mark}
Taken collectively, [the masses are]{.mark} themselves [a transpolitical
condition]{.mark}, and thus a stronger medium than all the
media.]{.underline}** That is to say, **[[they comprise a kind of
headless body, whose radical passivity absorbs all attempts at
manipulation from above through gestalt apathy, thus reversing the flow
of power, which traditionally relies on at least a modicum of civic
consciousness.]{.mark} Woven throughout such a scandalous view of the
populace]{.underline}**, however**[, is a challenge]{.underline}**,
should we decide to read it along a certain grain. The text notes:
Publicity, abstract, abject circulation of Eurodollars, stock prices,
immorality of fashion cycles, useless technologies of prestige,
electoral parades, arms escalation, all this is not only the historical
sign of the domination of capital, but the most decisive proof of a fact
more important than capital itself: **[no social project worthy of the
name has ever really existed]{.underline}**, that **[in the end no group
has ever really conceived itself as social,]{.underline}** that is to
say in solidarity with its own values and coherent in its collective
project, in short, **[there has never been even the shadow nor the
embryo of a responsible collective subject, nor even the possibility of
an objective of this kind.]{.underline}** (101-102)

**[[What may sound like a categorical dismissal of politics]{.mark},
anthropology, history]{.underline}**---in fact, the entire set of
Enlightenment trading cards---**[[can be]{.mark}, from a different
angle, considered [a starting point for]{.mark} an unprecedented
[rethinking]{.mark} of [what it means to exist as a social being without
a society]{.mark} of any traditional description.]{.underline}**
Indeed**, [the important question of what it means to
belong]{.underline}**, in an age which has pushed far beyond alienation,
has been taken up by contemporary Continental political philosophers,
often via the trope of the "multitude." Thinking through the possibility
of a "community-of-those-who-have-nothing-in-common"---along with the
conditions which block this possibility----is a supremely challenging
task. Baudrillard's ideas will have to be reread in the light of this
seemingly endless "state of exception" (a phrase mentioned more than
once in Fatal Strategies, and deployed most recently by Giorgio
Agamben).

The Last Laugh

"**[This revolution will not be symbolic, dazzling, and subjective, but
obscure and ironic. It won't be dialectical, it will be
fatal."]{.underline}** ---Jean Baudrillard

Half-way through Fatal Strategies, the author insists: ["**[This is not
\...a cynical philosophical view, but an objective view of societies,
and possibly of all systems of thought. The energy itself is
cynical]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[and immoral."]{.underline}** In other
words: ["**[You must be cynical or perish."]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[The choice between cynicism or death is not one peddlers of emo music
or "the new sincerity" care to contemplate these days.]{.underline}**

However, the mistake is to think of this stance as inimical to what
Bataille called "the practice of joy before death." Indeed,
**[Baudrillard's entire project can be glimpsed in his firm belief that
["there is perhaps another, more joyous way of seeing things, and of
finally substituting for eternally critical theory an ironic
theory]{.mark}]{.underline}**" (120). **[[The task is]{.mark} thus [to
be more cynical than cynical, in a global culture which is more real
than real.]{.mark} Hence his habit of promoting ideas, "if only for the
sake of change": a noble attempt, in an age of simulated novelty and
profound stagnation;]{.underline}** where the Eternal Return has been
replaced by the Eternal Rerun. But **[if radical pessimism has the
latent ability to "save us," is there not a subtext of salvation running
through Baudrillard's narrative? And how does this messianic trope
square with his impatience toward the various cargo cults]{.underline}**
(evangelism, capitalism, etc.) **[attempting to thaw the cryogenically
frozen body of history]{.underline}**?6

Indeed, it seems at times that this author cannot shake off the
soixante-huitard advocation of action: "**[[We need to coalesce all the
centrifugal forces to escape from this force of
inertia]{.mark}"]{.underline}** (125). Then again, such words may
represent merely a description of our dilemma, in the free indirect
mode. **[Were Baudrillard still here to put us straight on this
question, it would be surprising to hear an unambiguous answer, for that
would be to smother the fatal force of its challenge. After all, [the
function of polite]{.mark}]{.underline}** (i.e., neutralized)
**[[communication is transparency]{.mark}---something Baudrillard
considered [the most sterile form of evil]{.mark} yet concocted.
"\[Sjynthesis is a soft solution; dialectics a nostalgic one. The only
radical and modern answer: potentiate what is new, original, unexpected
\..."]{.underline}**

Baudrillard's list of targets includes psychoanalysis, moralism,
"America," second-wave feminism, pornography, cloning, false
radicality\... even yoga! In their stead, he seeks to locate **[[a
genuine revolution, on a scale or front that we]{.mark}--- as the
species-centric being par excellence---[have not anticipated.]{.mark}
Namely, [the "insurrection of the object,"]{.mark} which he describes as
"a silent revolution, but [the only one left]{.mark} now." [The fate of
the object is one strategy which]{.mark}]{.underline}**, according to
this book, **[[has long languished unclaimed in the Lost & Found office
of radical ideas]{.mark}; at least until now. And for this reason alone,
[it is a useful expansion of agency beyond the rather self-serving
principles of the human subject.]{.mark} "Only the subject desires; only
the object seduces"]{.underline}** (141).7

Consistent to the end---and even in the last years of his life---
Baudrillard shruggingly acknowledged **[[the possibility of "a
confrontation that is no longer precisely political but metaphysical and
symbolic]{.mark} in the strong sense." [As the West continues to]{.mark}
both [carnivalize and cannibalize itself under the self-appointed
mandate of an endless and abstract "war on terror," the oppressed,
exploited and colonized suffer from "a kind of enormous Stockholm
syndrome," parroting the values of those who hold them hostage, both
economically and ethically. And yet]{.mark},]{.underline}** just as he
did a couple of decades earlier in Fatal Strategies, **[the great
pataphysician sees an ongoing "justice in
reversibility."]{.underline}**8

The strategies Baudrillard documented so well, in an attempt to marshal
them into some kind of beneficial pattern, for the sake of a new and
vital currency, continue to pulse today without their master of
ceremonies. Thankfully we can confidently assume that **[[worldly ruses
and cosmic twists are still in store]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Baudrillard
was many things to many people: a prophet of the present, a writer of
science fiction, the most quotable thinker since Nietzsche, an alchemist
who managed to leach every last drop of sentimentality out of nostalgia,
the original Ronin of critical theory, and a man who talked incessantly
about the power of silence. The crystalline, high-altitude pleasure of
reading this particular book is the clarity of being liberated from
banal hope, and ushered toward a more fatal kind of orientation toward
the future. **[[Recognizing and appreciating the difference between a
fatal strategy, and common-or-garden fatalism, is the
challenge]{.underline}]{.mark}** that Baudrillard himself has left us.

#### Only a fatal strategy of hyper-conformity and indifference can resist the neo-liberalization of the university as a cite of productive education. Our subtle mimicry of the system renders the world more mysterious and enigmatic, avoiding information saturation and making debate possible again.

*Baudrillard, Youth, and American Film: Fatal Theory and Education*,
Rowman and Littlefield, 2016, 109-17

[Policies and discourse in schools and the general rhetoric around
education in the United States suggest that our society tends to value
children and adolescents **primarily for their economic
potential**]{.underline}. In itself, **[this amounts to a kind of
violence toward young people]{.underline}**. Further, as the previous
chapters have argued, films about teenagers often feed on adult
anxieties and moral panics about youth and, in turn, they reinforce the
idea that youth need to be controlled and should be pushed into
conformity. Movies in the third and fourth order of simulacra do this
with hyperreal images, convincing simulations of youth as reckless and
out-of- control, and Virtuality (e.g., found footage style
cinematography). Films of the third and fourth order featuring teen
characters have a relationship of reinforcement with
the rhetoric and policies that result in violence toward young people
and deepen the conflation of the systems of schooling and economics.
[**Critical education scholars, critical pedagogues, and others are
committed to highlighting and opposing the rhetorical violence **and the
more draconian school policies to which young people are subjected in
schools]{.underline}. [They also provide convincing arguments that
demonstrate the ways in which the system operates in the service of
capital]{.underline}. **[However, the responses to these phenomena that
their work offers are, from a Baudrillardian view, inefficacious since
they are rooted in an outmoded Marxist theory and lean on a commitment
to emancipation and liberation through pedagogy]{.underline}**. Here I
argue, **[the critical education work that is rooted in the traditions
of Marxism and critical theory, though it has been indispensable in
terms of locating and critiquing violent discourse and practice with
regard to education and youth, also promotes a cruel form of hope in
educational institutions as central figures in the reversal of the
lamentable current systemic trends]{.underline}**. It argues
that **[critical theory and pedagogy provide hope that systems, in
particular, education, can
be revolutionized]{.underline}**. [**[Critical theorists are right to
see mainstream schooling as a generator of the affective liquidity
leveraging neo-liberalism, but their suggestions
for resistance and revolution are less than
promising]{.underline}**.]{.mark} **[Modernist projects of critical
theory and pedagogy have proven to be mirages]{.underline}**. In their
place, **[I argue for a more viable, postmodern hope in the form
of fatal theory, fatal strategies, and radical thought]{.underline}**.
**[These related ideas from the later portion of Baudrillard's
corpus are applied here to the troublesome discourse about youth that
informs the systems in which they move, especially education, which
again, is increasingly subservient to other systems (e.g., political,
economic]{.underline}**). To begin, it should be noted that referring to
Baudrillardian concepts as contributing to forms of postmodern hope is a
bit precarious given his rejection of the postmodern. Below I discuss,
in some detail, Baudrillard's complex relationship with postmodernity. I
also specifically articulate why I have chosen to refer to my
application of fatal theory and radical thought to youth and education
as an effort toward postmodern hope. Before the full discussion of fatal
theory in light of education and youth, [I analyze the ways in which
**certain forms of resistance **(which are often taken up by critical
theorists in education) are **inefficacious in the current state of the
world**]{.underline}, [in late capitalism]{.underline}. Baudrillard's
ideas are central to that argument. Beyond this, [I argue that there are
two growing and particular kinds of critique in the age of ubiquitous
social media that also fail to hit their mark]{.underline}. Snide
remarks or "snark" as a reaction to offensive or anti-progressive
rhetoric and policy has become an increasingly popular means of
garnering online attention through displays of cleverness. **[Snark
is]{.underline}**, however, **[often associated with satire, which can
be understood as having affiliation with fatal
strategies]{.underline}**. So, **[there is a complicated relationship
between Baudrillard's fatal theory and snark]{.underline}**. I explore
this relationship below and ultimately argue that snark falls into the
category of a form of resistance or critique that gets absorbed into the
code. [Incredulity is another reaction by leftists and those associated
with critical theory to right-wing bigotry, ignorance, and
oppression]{.underline}. Again, [examples of such reactions are not
difficult to locate in social media]{.underline}. It has been an outlet
for an accruing amount of ostensive shock, astonishment, and disbelief
by progressives in the face of various expressions of
anti-progressivism. Like snark, incredulity seems to be a preferred tool
for responding to political and social rhetoric to which one is averse.
**[And also like snark, the inherent critique in incredulous reactions
is impotent in the late capitalist code]{.underline}**. To be clear,
**[when it comes to critical pedagogues and critical theorists with
interests in youth and education, it is not the content of their
concerns that I find wanting]{.underline}**. This is also the case, as
noted earlier, with regard to critical media literacy. **[Critical
pedagogy, in general, and critical media literacy, specifically, locate
and critique the same systemic violence as a Baudrillardian fatal theory
of youth and education]{.underline}**. [Violent discourse and policies
toward young people and their connection to institutions like schools is
of deep concern to both critical and fatal theorists]{.underline}.
**[But Baudrillard's [fatal theory focuses more on the level of form
than critical theory]{.mark}]{.underline}**. And, **[ultimately,
[radical thought provides possibilities for resistance that avoid being
subsumed by the late capitalist code]{.mark} whereas, the responses of
critical theory and critical pedagogy are vulnerable to being
incorporated into the code and repackaged as a set of signs to be
consumed]{.underline}**. Fatal theory/strategies and radical thought are
challenging notions within Baudrillard's corpus and the intent in this
chapter is to preserve their provocativeness in my analysis and
application to matters of youth and education. In so doing, **[it is
important to admit that this application work will not result in any
policy or practice suggestions]{.underline}**. [Such is not the outcome
of the pursuit of fatal strategies and its accompanying radical
thought]{.underline}. **[Rather, [their aim is well beyond the level of
policy as they seek to push on the negative conditions of the system
until it reverses course]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. **[Radical thought can
be accompanied by]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[what Baudrillard terms
"theory fiction" as [a way of rendering the world enigmatic]{.mark}, as
a means of [staying at the margins in order to anticipate the world and
its events that he claimed critical thought was lagging
behind]{.mark}]{.underline}**. 1 Relevant systems with respect to youth
and education are already given over to the late capitalist code. [The
system of schooling]{.underline}, for example, [is constantly subject to
externally imposed policy changes at both the macro and micro
levels]{.underline}. [Anecdotes abound in local American schools
regarding the rapidity with which new programs are implemented,
ostensibly in order to address a wide range of problems]{.underline}
including English language learners, [the so-called achievement gap,
bullying, perceived deficiencies in "social-emotional
learning]{.underline}," childhood obesity. While some of these issues
seem to have clear educational components, all of the programs that
schools adopt in order to address them fall under the category of what
David Labaree has called "the educationalization of social problems."2
**[Baudrillard's [radical thought and fatal theory]{.mark}, when
translated into this context of the system of schooling in the United
States, [reject the notion that making headway with these social issues
involves the constant adoption of new, "better" programs]{.mark},
replacing last year's model for ameliorating the achievement gap or
creating healthier school lunches [with a new "research based"
approach]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Ultimately [the radical thought and
postmodern hope that I am arguing for here **dismisses altogether the
educationalizing of social issues**]{.underline}, though not out of
insouciance. **[Rather, the fatal theorist in education understands that
the only available options are radical thought and theory fiction, which
do offer the hope of potentially flipping the very conditions that allow
for the current functioning of the late capitalist
system]{.underline}**. [Baudrillard's work has been **misread as
nihilistic**]{.underline}. As we saw above, Kellner is convinced of its
unequivocal pessimism. \"Baudrillard's nihi- lism is without joy,
without energy, without hope for a better future."3 [But Baudrillard
himself insisted that fatal theory and radical thought are, indeed,
hopeful]{.underline}. **["\[O\]ne must fight all charges of
irresponsibility, nihilism or despair. Radical thought is never
depressive]{.underline}**. **[On this point there is a total
misunderstanding]{.underline}**."4 In the context of education, there is
some amount of hope already in disabusing ourselves of the notion that
dialec- tical critique has efficacy within the late capitalist code. But
also, **[hope with regard to youth and education might lie in taking the
opposite tack of the critical theorists who react with incredulity to
the system working as it is designed to work]{.underline}**. **[[The
fatal theorist]{.underline}]{.mark}**, by contrast, **[[seeks to
destabilize through hyperconformity to the system's
expectations]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [To choose the path of fatal theory
and postmodern hope]{.underline}, though, [will mean abandoning our
projects, even our favored progressive ones, of educationalizing of
social problems]{.underline}. As mentioned above, **[connecting
Baudrillard with the notion of \"post- modern hope" requires
explanation]{.underline}**. His connection with postmodemity is complex.
His critics, namely Kellner, understood him as unequivocally
postmodernist. For those critics, this label meant that he was
nihilistic, that he in some sense celebrated the world he was
describing. Kellner, who was clearly no admirer of Baudrillard's
centralization of the semiot- ic, went so far as to call him a
"sign-fetishist."5 But Mike Gane and others have demonstrated clearly
that Kellner had misread Baudrillard. Indeed, Baudrillard specifically
resisted the label "postmodernist." He once said, \"I have nothing to do
with postmodernism."6 On Gane's reading, it is ironic that during the
19805, the rise of the postmodern counter-move- ment targeted
Baudrillard as "the high priest of postmodernism" since Baudrillard's
\"position is one of great hostility to the whole phenome- non."7 But
Gane later admitted that Baudrillard's rejection of the post- modern
label was done \"not entirely consistently, since occasionally he has
been willing to play with the opposition between the modern and the
postmodern."8 It should be noted that Gane's admission was not a change
of position on his reading of Baudrillard, rather, in the time be- tween
the two assertions, Baudrillard had made new statements regard- ing
modernity/postmodernity. Throughout the late 19805 and well into the
19905, Gane and Kellner argued over Baudrillard's relationship with
postmodernity. Gane, on the one side, asserted that Baudrillard's
project was to combat the postmod- ern (as is the case in Rex Butler's
claim that Baudrillard's work is \"in\' defence of the real").9 Kellner,
on the other, alleged Cane was wrong and that Baudrillard's project was
surely "connected in intricate ways to the problematic of the
postmodern." 10 For his part, Gane was convinced that Kellner had
\"ulterior objectives" in his reading of Baudrillard. "Kellner has
attempted a critique of Baudrillard that first sets up the modernity-
postmodernity model and then claims that Baudrillard underestimates the
potential for a Marxist appraisal of this shift and resistance to it,\"
according to [Gane]{.underline}, who, then [went on to critique
Kellner's position saying, "The problem with this line of reading
Baudrillard is that it launches the critique too soon at the wrong
object: a critique of a phantom based on a crude and dogmatic appeal to
a theory of capitalism and of revolutionary mass action and social
transformation]{.underline}." Gane eventually argued that, in the end,
[Baudrillard's later writing seems to settle the issue since he neglects
to use the term postmodern much and rarely employs the
concept]{.underline}. That is, "it does not map on to either the third
or fourth order simulacra categories," and, beyond this, \"By locating
the emergence of the term in Baudrillard's writing it does look as if
its func- tion has been to specify one of the routes not to take within
fourth order culture" (emphasis mine).12 Although I am much more
sympathetic to Gane's reading of Baudril- lard than Kellner's, as has
been clear throughout, [here I am using]{.underline} the phrase
"[postmodern hope" to describe the result of replacing critical theory
with fatal theory and radical thought in the efforts to resist violent
rhetoric and policy regarding youth and education]{.underline}. I use
the term postmodern with some amount of trepidation though, in the end,
I find it necessary. Not only did Baudrillard reject it as a label, it
also is a danger- ous word since it elicits rabid reactions from some
who take issue with a broad set of arguments filed under postmodernism.
It can also, for the same or similar reasons, trigger outright dismissal
of any arguments that follow when it is mentioned. I am also well aware,
on the other hand, that the term postmodernism can attract too quick and
too eager agreement for those whom I would call celebratory
postmodernists, who I take to be the inverse of the dismissive lot
previously mentioned. In this case the content of the arguments that
follow are less important than the moniker that precedes them.
Celebratory postmodernists could also refer to those who find particular
elements of the break with modernity to be welcome (e.g., the loss of
the real, the onset of nihilism) developments. I do not count myself
among this group; on the contrary, and it is the group into which
Kellner mistakenly places Baudrillard. Because of these complica- tions
around postmodernism, I want to be very clear about my use of the term.
First, [I am using postmodern to generally classify my descriptive
arguments about the world]{.underline}. [The primary animating ideas
surrounding these arguments are taken from Baudrillard---the third (and
eventually fourth) order of simulacra, simulations, and hyperreality,
or, the loss of the real]{.underline}. Again, **[for Baudrillard, [the
loss of the real was a descriptive critique]{.mark} and his entire
project was to defend the real through a description of a world in which
[the semiotic has colonized the symbolic, a world in which the
trajectory of communications technology has substituted virtual
non-communication for proximal human interaction, and the deluge of
signs without referents---a world of simulations that have supplanted
the dialectical relationship between illusion and the
real]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[Baudrillard found all of this
lamentable]{.underline}**. In the context of critical scholars of
education and youth, Baudrillard's descriptive arguments are best
referred to as postmodern since critical theorists tend to rely on
Marxian notions that Bau- drillard came to reject.13 [Beyond this,
specifically in the field of philosophy of education the preponderance
of arguments is based in classical (mostly Plato and Aristotle) or
modern (mostly Dewey and critical theory) thought]{.underline}. There
are numerous exceptions, to be clear. However, [when philosophy is
applied to education, it is generally the case that arguments favor what
are understood as either classical or modern philosophical
traditions]{.underline}. In my view, **[Baudrillard's ideas fall into
neither category and his particular descriptive arguments can be
understood as more radical than those that rely on critical
theory]{.underline}**. Additionally, and perhaps more to the point, **[I
am using the term postmodern to describe a lack of faith in
Enlightenment projects and modern forms of dialectical
critique]{.underline}**. To the degree that this lack of faith is an
indicator of postmodernism, [a Baudrillardian form of hope is
appropriately understood as postmodern]{.underline}. As he said,
\"**[All forms that tend to project a dazzling and miraculous liberty
are only revolutionary homilies]{.underline}**." 14 **[For him the late
capitalist code is adept at subsuming critique and offering it back as a
set of signs to be consumed]{.underline}**. **[The code actually
encourages a certain level of critique]{.underline}**. Pawlett says,
"**[effective resistance cannot be dialectical because synthesis or
resolution is the very dynamic of the capitalist system as it constantly
revolutionises itself through the sign code. In other words [critique is
rapidly absorbed by simulation]{.mark}]{.underline}**."15 In my View,
[there is some amount of hope already in disabusing our- selves of the
notion that dialectical critique has efficacy within the late capitalist
code]{.underline}. Relatedly, [postmodern hope can come in the form of
locating and understanding various forms of false hope that stem from
the various forms of what I have called modern descriptions of the world
above]{.underline}. In addition to this initial postmodern hope that
comes along with a separation from false hope, **[I also want to offer
the idea that hope with regard to youth and education might lie in
taking the opposite tack of the critical theorists or the kind of
critique that begins with incredulity in the face of the system working
precisely as it is designed]{.underline}**. That is, **[[the functioning
of the system can be destabilized through a hyperconformity to its
expectations]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Although this notion will be taken
up in more detail below, [one of the ways in which it translates to the
present study of youth and education is refusal to support the
educationalizing social problems]{.underline}---**[not even the ones
those of us who count ourselves as radicals or progressives like since
the responses that educational institutions have with regard to social
issues are precoded anyway]{.underline}**. As mentioned above, David
Labaree has made significant contribu--- tions to the analysis of the
educationalization of social problems. **[Schools in the United States
continue to be the primary location for attempting to address social
problems and yet, they are demonstrably unsuccessful in doing
so]{.underline}**. Labaree's explanation is that, as a society, we are
content with a formalized version of social reform that does not
actually hit its target, since this gives us satisfaction with regard to
social ills and at the same time does not violate the particular brand
of liberalism in\' the United States that emphasizes individualism. He
says: We assign formal responsibility to education for solving our most
pressing social problems 111\' light of our highest social ideals, with
the tacit understandm'g that by educationalizing these problem---solving
ef- forts we are seeking a solution that is more formal than
substantive. We are saying that we are willing to accept what education
can produce- new programs, new curricula, new ms\'titutions, new
degrees, new edu- cational opportunities---m place of solutions that
might make real changes m\' the ways in which we distribute social
power, wealth, and honor.16 Below I discuss in detail how lack of
support for the educationalizing of social problems is related to the
fatal strategy of hyperconformity to the system. Before a full
examination of fatal theory and radical thought as applied to education
and youth, **[it is important to understand how some critical reactions
to late capitalism end up reinforcing the rationality of the
system]{.underline}**. IN CREDULITY, SNARK, AND THE REIN SCRII'I\'I ON
OF CAPITALIST RATIONALITY **[Much of the response to specific incidences
the sort of violence directed at young people generally and specifically
in schools is often met with is a kind of disbelief or amazement by
critical pedagogues and critical theory scholars concerned with the
state of schooling or treatment of youth in the United
States]{.underline}**. [This is not altogether different from the
typical response of most progressives and leftists to any ignorant,
bigoted, or otherwise offensive statement or act by conservative
politicians and pundits, right-wing religious zealots, or social
commentators]{.underline}. [Social media's rise to ubiquity has enabled
a high level of visibility of these kinds of reactions. Both Facebook
and Twitter (to use the most popular examples) are replete with
incredulous responses to the most obstreperous racism and sexism and
fundamental religion-based hatred]{.underline}. **["Can you believe what
\[well-known political or social figure or commentator\] just said?!" is
a familiar Internet trope]{.underline}**. Yet, [this response of
incredulity is curious]{.underline}. [What do criticalists and leftists
expect from right-wing or fundamentalist commentators? Should we
continue to be shocked and amazed by the same rhetoric from the same
talking heads? Should we expect that politicians with a track record of
thinly veiled bigotry will eventually align them- selves with
anti-racist or anti-sexist social movements]{.underline}? Through a
Baudrillardian lens, it can be argued that **[these responses of
incredulity end up reinforcing the rationality of the
system]{.underline}**. [It seems as though the kinds of reactions
analyzed above are akin to the response critical theorists and
progressive educators have to anti- democratic school reform and
continued evidence that school policies and rhetoric regarding youth are
**animated by market logic**]{.underline}. On one pos- sible reading the
response of incredulity is a form of dialectical critique. And insofar
as late capitalism is the enemy of the aims of democratic education,
this may be a problem since, according to Baudrillard, [in late
capitalism dialectic resistance is no longer possible]{.underline}.
Therefore, **[[any traditional critique of the system assumes and even
reinforces the rationality of the system]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In the
end, [the point is that what is responded to with incredulity should not
be surprising or shocking]{.underline}. Valuing unfettered market logic
is precisely the way the system works. [Why are we surprised when late
capitalism functions exactly the way it is supposed to]{.underline}?
**[It is designed to stretch and create new markets (out of teenagers or
public institutions such as schools) and manipulate them]{.underline}**.
And **[traditional forms of resistance, based in critical or
emancipatory theories are only capable of producing signs of
resistance]{.underline}**. As William Pawlett puts it: According to
Baudrillard [there is no more dialectic of measuring, either in
representation, the dialectic between the sign and reference, or in
economics between supply and demand]{.underline}. **[The \[late
capitalist\] code absorbs these through "predictive anticipation" and
"planned socialisation," which extends far beyond the production and
consumption of goods and incorporates \"needs, knowledge, culture,
information, sexuality" as terms of the code]{.underline}**. [**[All
that once had an \"explosive force" is defused, deterred or contained;
there may still be signs of the dialectic, but they are precisely that:
only signs]{.underline}**.]{.mark} **[Signs of revolt and liberation
abound (Che Guevara t-shirts and gay couples on TV). But these are signs
generated by the capitalist system and any "revolution" they generate is
at the level of the sign]{.underline}**. 17 My argument here is that
**[to respond with incredulity is to create a Sign of
revolt]{.underline}**. **[This contemporary form of incredulity is a
form of outmoded dialectical critique adorned with the accouterment of
the social media age that ends up adding to a set of signs to be
consumed]{.underline}**. **[One of the ways in which this phenomenon
articulates itself is in the tone and style that critical progressives
often employ when responding incredulously to offensive policies,
speech, and acts]{.underline}**. That is, I think the kind of response
referred to above that I find exemplified in social media Sometimes
engenders the false hope of what I will call here, the Club of Snark. By
this I mean that snark often becomes the extension of the in- Credulous
response. Snark, combined with the development of (non) communications
technology and social media, can result in a race to see who can
generate the most cleverly constructed retort. [In the case of
progressive and critical educators, a virtual club is then formed around
snarky riposte to the opponents of democratic/Deweyan-inspired ideas
about schooling and school reform or to the bigoted and neoliberal
opponents of critical pedagogues]{.underline}. No doubt, progressives
and others on the Left are by no means the only groups participating in
snark. I focus on progressives, the Left, critical theorists and
pedagogues because those are the groups with which a fatal theorist in
education is aligned in terms of sets of concerns about youth and
education. My concern is that the pro- gressive Clubs of Snark are
ineffective in terms of reversrnig conditions.

#### Insisting on the determinacy of signs, the will to transparency in language and learning, forms the motor of social control. Instead, we advocate for fatal theory and radical thought that can restore the symbolic space of mystery through an ironic indifference that elides mastery.

Lewis University, *Baudrillard, Youth, and American Film: Fatal Theory
and Education*, Rowman and Littlefield, 2016, 117-127

For his part, [Baudrillard has been accused of not theorizing resistance
at all]{.underline}, most notably by Kellner." But Pawlett and others
have understood this as a misreading, owing primarily to the ideological
commitments of the accuser. "**[Baudrillard does not neglect to theorise
resistance . . . he theorises in a non- or post-Marxist manner, which,
in itself, is unforgivable for Marxists]{.underline}**."22 **[[In place
of]{.mark} a Marxist theory of [resistance, Baudrillard offers fatal
theory and radical thought]{.mark}]{.underline}**. That is, **[he
provides a companion theory of resistance alongside his theory of the
semiotic colonization of the symbolic and the orders of
simulacra]{.underline}**. Gane put it this way: Baudrillard provides not
only a theory of the semiotic stages of West--- ern culture, but also a
new way of relatin\'g to this theory. Thus, [as his\' writings suggest
new analyses of simulations, transpolitical forms, virtual cultures, his
relation to them is not a critical rationalism]{.underline}. **[His\'
writing attempts to provoke a paradoxical counter-spiral]{.underline}**.
And [the distance between the two spirals is precisely that of the
ritual, the symbolic relation, not one of mastery or possession or
ressentiment]{.underline}.23 **[The counter-spiral in Baudrillard's
writing is indeed the articulation of his theory of resistance that was
denied by Kellner]{.underline}**. **[It is the [radical thought]{.mark}
that [seeks to restore symbolic interaction through operating on the
margins and the fatal strategies of anticipation of the ironic force of
the object in lieu of mastery of it]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.
**[Baudrillard's theory of resistance aims to avoid the reinscription of
the rationality of the system and to circumvent neutralization in the
code]{.underline}**]{.mark}. Like the misreading of Baudrillard as not
theorizing resistance, [his critics have also misread him as accepting
or celebrating that which he actually critiques. His entire project, as
several Baudrillardian scholars have noted in contrast with the critics'
misreading, is critical of the cur- rent semiotic stage and the loss of
the symbolic]{.underline}. **[[The theories of simulation and
hyperreality are critical and in particular stand in contrast with
institutions that reinforce the hyperreal]{.underline}]{.mark}**. As
Pawlett says: [Baudrillard's notions of simulation, deterrence and
hyperreality are still, part at least, critical notions. That is to say
that the system, and its key institutions of control---politics,
finance, education, media, and advertising corporations---still
understand the world in\' terms of the second order, of representation
and referentiality]{.underline}. . . . Indeed, **[these institutions
[actually push the system further and further]{.mark} into hyper-reality
[by multiplying signifiers that are supposedly attached to stable
signifiers but, their very multiplicity, actually loosen the
relationship between signifier and signified]{.mark}]{.underline}**.24
Not surprisingly [Pawlett mentions the system of education]{.underline}
(read: school- ln\'g) here as one that functions with a second order
simulacra View of the World. **[Especially in the United States, [the
schooling system is entirely insistent on the world of reality and
representation and it is dogmatically committed to fixed
referentiality]{.mark}]{.underline}**, that is, **[a hyperdeterminacy of
signs [to the point that we begin to suspect that there is no real
relationship between signifiers and signifieds]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
One thinks here of the phenomenon of educational "buzzwords" with which
scholars and practitioners of edu- cation are completely familiar.
**[Yet, [its insistence on the determinacy of signs is what makes it a
primary system of social control]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In
Baudrillard's View, in the third and certainly the fourth order, [in the
full virtualization of the world, **critical thought is no longer
tenable**]{.underline}. [In the order of integral reality, the real has
fully disappeared and along with it, illusion and the possibility of
dialectic critique]{.underline}. One of his later texts, The Perfect
Crime, discussed the end of critical thought and dismissed it as
"intellectually anachronistic!"25 [Instead of a world that calls for
defending critical values in an as yet unactualized world, Baudrillard
described a world in which reality was at its height]{.underline}.
**[This is the world of too much reality and objectivity, not a lack of
it, a world of full actualization]{.underline}**. **[[Hyperreality
constitutes this world in which]{.mark} reality lacks nothing and all
negation has been subsumed]{.underline}**. And **[here [there is no
longer any critical thought]{.mark}]{.underline}**. He said:
\[C\]ritical thought . . . is 111\' substance ended. **[Even if it had
survived its catastrophic secularization in all the political movements
of the twentieth century, this ideal and seemingly necessary
relationship between the concept and reality would, at all events, be
destroyed today]{.underline}**. **[[It has broken down under pressure
from a gigantic technical and mental simulation, to be replaced by an
autonomy of the virtual, henceforth liberated from the real, and a
simultaneous autonomy of the real which we see functioning on its own
account in\']{.mark} a demented---that is, [infinitely self-referential
--- perspective]{.mark}]{.underline}**. 26 His critics accused him of
nihilism. As we saw above, though, this was a misreading by Marxist
scholars who may have had difficulty accepting Baudrillard's post- or
non-Marxist critiques. Having described the world as one in which
critical thought has ended, he offered radical thought as a means of
resistance in the third and fourth orders. His most complete description
of radical thought also comes from The Perfect Crime. **[The other form
of thought [\[radical thought\] is eccentric to the real, a stranger to
dialectics, a stranger even to critical
thought]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} [It is not even a disavowal of
the concept of reality]{.underline}. **[It is illusion, power of
illusion, or in other words, a playing with reality, as seduction is a
playing with desire, as a metaphor is playing with truth]{.underline}**.
**[This radical thought does not stem from a philosophical doubt, a
utopian transference, or an ideal transcendence]{.underline}**. It is
the material illusion, immanent in this so-called \"real\" world.27
**[[Radical thought]{.mark}, then, is able to avoid the pitfalls of
critical thought in the third and fourth orders. It does not succumb to
being subsumed in the way that the negative is subsumed in dialectical
critique in the late capitalist code]{.underline}**. Instead, **[it
[functions on the margins by reincorporating the place of illusion that
is lost in the orders of hyperreality and virtuality]{.mark}.
Baudrillard claimed, \"Radical thought . . . anagrammatizes, it
disperses concepts and ideas and, by its reversible sequencing, takes
account both of meaning and the fundamental illusoriness of
meaning]{.underline}**." **[Illusion, the very component of cinema that
Baudrillard found to be disappearing in its contamination by television,
is restored in radical thought]{.underline}**. **[[Illusion is]{.mark}
not just [absent from]{.mark} contemporary film but also in
[policy]{.mark} and rhetoric related to youth and
education]{.underline}**. [**[Accountability, transparency, clarity,
responsibility, objectivity, and facts---these concepts drive the
institutions in which young people mandatorily
operate]{.underline}**.]{.mark} But Baudrillard said, "**[[Work over the
illusion. Create illusion to create an event. Make enigmatic what is
clear, render unintelligible what is only too intelligible, make the
event itself unreadable. Accentuate the false transparency of the
world]{.underline}]{.mark}**." Institutions that cling to a second order
understanding of the world encourage quite the opposite when they push
for straightforwardness and verity. In so doing, they end up pushing the
world further into hyperreality. [In Pawlett's analysis of Baudrillard's
radical thought, it leads directly to fatal strategies]{.underline}. In
particular, he says \"**[the only strategy remaining is the annulment of
the meaning of signs into indeterminacy]{.underline}**." 30
[Institutions that are directly connected to young people, like schools,
deal in hyperdeterminacy of signs]{.underline}. That is, [meaning is
semiotically trapped inside bureaucratized "buzzwords" and
phrases]{.underline}. Zero-tolerance policies sprout up in this milieu.
Teen identity categories are simulatorily overdetermined as was
demonstrated in the previous chapter on The Breakfast Club. [An
atmosphere of control, fueled by a hyperdeterminacy of the meaning of
signs seems to accompany any institution that deals with
youth]{.underline}. Again, **[much like the current state of cinema,
schools and other institutions ostensibly serving young people rarely,
if ever, function with any sense of illusion]{.underline}**. [Schools in
particular cling with white knuckles to a second order view of the world
yielding layers of hyperdeterminacy of meaning]{.underline}. [They have
doubled down on their commitment to objectivity and facts in the third
and fourth orders, but **"[radical thought]{.mark}, for its part, wagers
on the illusion of the world**]{.underline}. **[[It aspires to the
status of illusion, restoring the non-veracity of facts, the
non-signification of the world, proposing the opposite hypothesis that
there is nothing rather than something, and going in pursuit of that
nothing which runs beneath the apparent continuity of
meaning]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Radical Thought for Youth and Education:
Hyperconformity and Indeterminacy [Institutions that directly involve
young people, namely schools, are currently at the point of functioning
as an arm of the late capitalist system]{.underline}. That is,
[television, films, social media, and schooling are all of a piece in
that they are ultimately in the service of capital]{.underline}. This
is, in part, why there is such a tight relationship between media
discourse about youth and rhetoric regarding young people in schools. We
should, therefore, understand and respond to the system of schooling as
such. **[Part of this response might include executing hyperconformity
to the system in the form of being more aggressive about the
schooling/education distinction]{.underline}**. In everyday, popular
discourse schooling and education are largely conflated. This error is
consistently corrected in graduate courses in schools and colleges of
education, if not in undergraduate courses. There is a distinction
between schooling and education, we are taught. Schooling has something
to do with formalization whereas education is a broader term, referring
to a litany of forms of human adaptability. Of course, tlu\'s is just
one of a surfeit of articulations and explanations of the distinction.
In the end, we all know there is a difference between schooling and
education and part of that difference is the difficulty in defin\'in\'g
the broader concept of the latter. This is an idea that scholars of
education and youth learn in the early stages of development. Yet,
collectively we do not seem to execute the distinction with persistence,
including those of us who oppose the goals of schooling in late
capitalism. A clear disarticu- lation of the two might be a way to begin
to apply fatal theory to educa- tion, to help to disrupt the system of
schooling. **[[Education, if fundamentally treated as a concept that has
little or perhaps even nothing to do with]{.mark} schooling in late
[capitalism, could]{.mark} then [be imbued with symbolic
exchange]{.mark} and more immediate forms of
communication]{.underline}**. **[A rigid differentiation between
schooling and education can help set the conditions for applying fatal
theory to the problem of violence toward youth through hyperconformity
and indeterminacy]{.underline}**. **[What might this look
like]{.underline}**? **[[Perhaps a reversal of the discourse
around]{.mark} young people and [education involves an effort to render
the world enigmatic]{.mark} for them, a particular form of the annulment
of the meaning of signs into indeterminacy]{.underline}**. [The
consequences of the current system of education and the dominant
rhetoric regarding youth in late capitalism have included a desperate
pursuit of measurement (almost entirely through quantification) and the
virtual disappearance of the enigmatic]{.underline}. Indeed, **[enigma
is, by many accounts, suppressed in the system of schooling in the
United States]{.underline}**. **[Scientism and the consistent
over-valuing of a flimsy form of certainty is]{.underline}**, in my
view, **[opposed to education]{.underline}**. **[Illusion and enigma,
troubling the very notion of "facts"; though he did not specifically
link these ideas to education, Baudrillard did establish them as bound
up in radical thought]{.underline}**. **[When applied to youth and
education, we can see that [radical thought and fatal strategies that
annul the meaning of signs into indeterminacy is directly opposed to the
conservative thought that is typically associated with rhetoric and
polices of schooling and these are almost always conflated with the
larger concept of education]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Again, [my argument
here is that **pushing toward indeterminacy is central to education but
is opposed by schooling** and therefore, **the fatal theorist in
education operates with a hard distinction between the two---not a
loose, academic one**]{.underline}. **[[Distinguishing education from
schooling in this way not only opens space for radical thinking in the
form of indeterminacy, it also allows for the fatal strategy of
hyperconformity to the system]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Labaree's argument
about the educationalization of social problems is instructive here.
Insofar as we understand the system of schooling in the United States as
operating directly at the tension between the inherent collectivism of
liberal democracy on the one hand and American individualism on the
other, Labaree's explanation of why schools are increasingly asked to
address social problems when it is demonstrably the case that they are
highly ineffective at the task is convincm\'g. However, [if we take a
Baudrillardian view on the school]{.underline}, that is, [as a modern
institution with a second order understanding of the world that also
operates m\' the full service of capital, if we understand the battle
for the fundamental purpose of schooling to have already been lost to
private interest, that phenomenon itself becomes the
explanation]{.underline}. **[Capital is always served when public
institutions are set up for and/or charged with failure to ameliorate
social ills since the answer then becomes to allow the market to
intervene]{.underline}**. In the case of schools in the United States,
[this happens through the inﬂux of corporate language (a
well-established trend), a reliance on corporations for materials to
support the steady succession of mandated programs, or in some cases,
literally turning the school over to a corporation]{.underline}.
Hyperconformity to this system might mean, then, to not support schools
as an institutional location for treating social problems. [Though
critical pedagogues and other progressives and Leftists understand
schools in the United States to have been colonized by the interests of
the market, many still argue that schools should take on a number of
social issues]{.underline}. **[In order to hyperconform to the system of
schooling, it must be recognized as thoroughly subservient to the
economic system in late capitalism and be treated as such by withdrawing
support for schools to be charged with addressing cases of social
concern]{.underline}**. **[We know this is not the function of schools
in late capitalism anyway so, to push these negative conditions until
they flip, [a hyperconformity to the system is necessary since
traditional, dialectic critique gets neutralized into the
code]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Another version of Baudrillardian
indeterminacy with regard to youth was suggested at the end of the
previous chapter. **[Restoring to children and adolescents their own
strangeness, encouraging a sense of inner alterity and radical
otherness, are precisely not functions of the system of schooling in the
United States]{.underline}**. On the contrary, [conformity to the
system, homogenization, and locating a specific identity category are
encouraged]{.underline}. **[Thematizing or demonstrating alterity is
often punished]{.underline}**. As we saw with the simulations in The
Breakfast Club, [**even when precoded identity categories are questioned
in the context of schools**, it is **done in the service of eliminating
otherness**, as in, "**we are each all of these identity categories at
once," which not only creates the ebbing of alterity but also ends up
reinforcing the identity categories that are ostensibly
questioned**]{.underline}. [**[The kind of radical thought that
accompanies hyperconformity and indeterminacy is always anticipatory and
at the margins]{.underline}**.]{.mark} [One way to think with
anticipation and exceptionality is to engage in a postmodern, **radical
Popperian falsifiability** as Baudrillard did with his theory of
simulation]{.underline}. "**[So]{.underline}**, for example, **[you put
forward the idea of simulacrum, without really believing in it, even
hoping the real will refute it . . . Alas, only the fanatical supporters
of reality react; reality, for its part, does not seem to wish to prove
you wrong]{.underline}**."32 In this case, [Baudrillard's claims were
not falsified, but in the wake of simulation theory being "confirmed,"
he was able to argue, \"The simulated disorder of things has moved
faster than we have]{.underline}." **[If simulation theory cannot be
falsified, we have a strong argument for radical thought.]{.underline}**
That is, **[[the world of simulation requires the enacting of fatal
strategies, of employing a kind of radical speculation in order to
anticipate events, of trying out marginal ideas to see if the world can
falsify them]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Paradoxically, this postmodern
Popperianism is often demonstrated in film and television]{.underline},
that is, [on the very screens with which Baudrillard had a love/hate
relationship]{.underline}. [Take the recent speculative
fiction/dystopian British television series, **Black Mirror**, for
example]{.underline}. In each episode, [a near future is imagined in
which technology, politics, crime, social relations, death, and intimacy
form disastrous confluences]{.underline}. In one episode, \"[The Entire
History of You," a device implanted behind one's ear that records all
life events and makes them available for video playback on screens or in
the wearer's eye is commonplace]{.underline}. [A young lawyer, his wife,
and their social circle interact with a number of issues that are made
unique in a world with the "grain" device]{.underline}. [These include
second guessing a response in a professional setting]{.underline} and
[using the viewing of previous sexual encounters as a source of arousal
during actual, proximal sex]{.underline}. Yet, at a dinner party, [when
one of the guests who has had her "grain" stolen (read: ripped out of
her skin) says she has no plans of replacing it, the others suggest that
they would not be able to function without their\' devices]{.underline}.
The show ends with the dissolving of the relationship between the main
characters after the \"grain\" has been the animating force in the
lawyer discovering his wife's infidelity and his obsession with watching
the relevant footage, which are called "re-dos." In another Black Mirror
episode, \"Fifteen Million Merits," [a future dystopian world is
imagined in which the vast majority of people must ride stationary
bicycles that provide power for the society]{.underline}. [They earn
\"merits\" that allow for their sustenance but if they pedal extra time
or with in- creased speed, they have disposable income with which they
can purchase virtual luxuries]{.underline}. [Although it costs an
exorbitant amount of merits, the one way these proletarian bike riders
can transcend their position is , through buying a ticket to potentially
perform on the American Idol-like game show, \"Hot Shots]{.underline}."
The main character, [Bing, gifts his merits to his girlfriend, who has a
pleasant singing voice, so she can buy herself a Chance to become a pop
star and leave the life of bicycle pedaling with a successful \"Hot
Shots" audition]{.underline}. Although her performance seems to be going
well, [the \"Hot Shots\" judges stop her in the middle of the song,
offering her a role as one of the society's porn starts on the erotica
chan- nel instead]{.underline}. As it is her only chance to escape her
servile life on the bike, she reluctantly agrees. [Bing is distraught
and angry with the judges' manipulation of his girlfriend's life, pedals
his bike with extraordinary determination, and conserves his merits
until he has earned enough to buy himself a ticket to audition on "Hot
Shots]{.underline}." **[He ostensibly performs a dance routine but a few
moments into it he stops, reveals a shard of glass he had sneaked into
the audition, holds it to his throat and then goes on a rant of
admonition of the judges and what they did to his
girlfriend]{.underline}**. **[He rails against the entire system and its
disregard for humanity. The final twist in the episode comes in the form
of the \"Hot Shots" judges applauding his "performance" and offering him
his own show. In the last scenes, we see Bing "ranting" into a camera,
holding the shard of glass to his throat, and then we see bike riders
tuning into his show, at the end of which he reminds them to tune in
next week for another speech]{.underline}**. Both episodes serve to
anticipate the potential pitfalls of the trajectory of modern media and
technology. [They can be read as dystopian science fiction, the
imagining of a worst-case scenario in the development of technology and
the trend toward the concentration of wealth in late
capitalism]{.underline}. **[But they are arguably functioning as the
fatal strategy of radical Popperianism, articulating bold hypotheses
about the trajectory of the world that may or may not be falsified in
the future]{.underline}**. Or, Black Mirror is conceivably an
articulation of thought about the current state of affairs from the
extreme margins, not anticipating the lamentable aspects of a
world-gone-wrong but rather, a figurative statement about contemporary
times. After all, how much different is the \"grain\" device in "The
Entire History of You" that records one's life and allows for \"re-dos"
than the proliferation of life-mediation by screen for which omnipresent
smart- phones are primarily used? Recuperation (in the sociological
sense) of subversive activity that is depicted in \"Fifteen Million
Merits" is evident m\' contemporary society. **[One can think here of
all the instances in\' which originally seditious music or art is
eventually used to support markets or Conservative
politics]{.underline}**. As a recent example, **[in 2015, Dee Snider, of
the 1980s heavy metal band, Twisted Sister, gave permission to
Republican Presidential candidate, Donald Trump, to use the band's
anthem, \"We're Not Gonna Take It" on the campaign
trail]{.underline}**.34 [Thought of in this way, Black "Mirror is less
an imagined dystopic future and more a metaphoric critique of the
present]{.underline}. [Or, as Baudrillard said, **"Science fiction?
Hardly."**]{.underline}35 At all events, **[Black Mirror can be
understood as a kind of radical thought]{.underline}**. [But given
Baudrillard's critique of the screenification of the world, how can this
be]{.underline}? At the most basic level, [Baudrillard's arguments are
about the loss of the symbolic and the ways in which simulacra have
colonized the world/the real]{.underline}. **[This creates a situation
in which critique and resistance get swallowed up by the consumer code
and spit back out as a set of signs to be consumed]{.underline}**.
**[But Black Mirror is itself a series of hyperreal
images]{.underline}**. **[Put another way, the paradox is that this loss
of the svmbolic and the lamentable effects of total simulation are
illustrated well by hyperreal images in Black Mirror]{.underline}**.
Baudrillard largely understood hyperreal films and Reality TV to be
evidence for his theses, not critiques of the loss of the symbolic or
critiques of telemorphosis (though as men- tioned previously he did
acknowledge a few films around the turn of the twenty-first century to
have taken on the subject of the blurring between the real and the
Virtual).36 **[What does it mean that particular media iterations (films
and TV shows) are catalysts for the Baudrillard-inspired critique of
media here? Can television/media critique the telemorphic trajec- tory
of which they are constitutive? It seems that they can]{.underline}**.
[This is in part the case because of **the importance of paradox in
Baudrillard's corpus**]{.underline}. But beyond this, **[it is clear
that there is room in his ideas about resistance through radical thought
for using TV and cinema in that process]{.underline}**. He said, \"[You
have to live in collusion with the system and in revolt against its
consequences. You have to live with the idea that we have survived the
worst]{.underline}."37 [How then, can the radical thought and fatal
theory exempliﬁed in\' Black Mirror be understood in the context of
education and youth]{.underline}? That is, **[how does anticipatory,
marginal thought apply to a radically new education?]{.underline}**
**[There is clearly a dearth of radical thought in the context of youth
and education]{.underline}**. But [to imagine a new kind of education
and a new discourse regarding young people is itself to think with
anticipation and on the margins]{.underline}. [Baudrillard
suggested]{.underline}, [in his discussion of radical
thought]{.underline}, that **[the proposition of his theory of the
simulacrum itself was exemplary of insisting on illusoriness, to render
the intelligible unintelligible]{.underline}**. [**This kind of radical
thought is sorely needed to flip the negative conditions of the system
that produces the kind of violence toward young people** fueled by
contemporary films.]{.underline}

### Pawlett

#### Exterior critiques of the system miss the point by being too close to the mark: they only reify the reality principle of semiotic systems -- the ground these radical moves chose to fight on is demarcated and beaten in advance. All are complicit and so attempts to criticize the system on the plane of the real succumb to the will towards integral reality. 

**Pawlett 14.** William Pawlett, senior lecturer in media,
communications, and cultural studies at the University of Wolverhampton,
UK, "Society At War With Itself," International Journal of Baudrillard
Studies, Volume 11, Number 2 (May, 2014)

[It all depends on **the ground we choose to fight on** ... most often
... [we choose to fight on ground where we are **beaten before we
begin**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Baudrillard 2001: 119). This paper
examines Baudrillard's assertion, made in later works
includingImpossible Exchange (2001), The Intelligence of Evil (2005) and
Pyres of Autumn(2006), that [individuals, society and indeed the global
system, are internally and irreconcilably divided, that **[modernity is
'at odds with itself']{.mark}**]{.underline} (Baudrillard 2006: 1). In
his view dissent, **[rejection and [insurrection emerge from within, not
from external challenges]{.mark} such as alternative ideologies or
competing worldviews, but from within bodies, within borders, inside
programmes]{.underline}**. For Baudrillard [much of the violence, hatred
and discomfort visible around the globe can be understood as a **latent
but fundamental 'silent insurrection'** against the **global integrating
system** and its many pressures, demands and humiliations]{.underline}
(2001: 106). [This is anendogenic or intra-genic rejection, [it emanates
from within the system]{.mark}, from within individuals, even [from
within language]{.mark}, electronic systems and bodily cells, erupting
as **abreaction, metastasis and sudden
reversal**]{.underline}.[2](http://www2.ubishops.ca/baudrillardstudies/vol-11_2/v11-2-pawlett.html#ft-endnote2)
For Baudrillard then, [despite the many simulations of external threat
and enmity -- radical Islam currently being the best example -- **the
most dangerous threat lies within**: 'society faces a far harder test
than any external threat: that of **its own absence, its loss of
reality'**]{.underline} (2006: 1). [The global order, conventionally
labelled "capitalist", is **neutralising its values and
structures**]{.underline}, [its ideologies disappear, its principles are
sacrificed]{.underline}. **[Even the sense of "reality" produced by the
abstract sign and by simulation models begin to disappear]{.underline}**
(2005: 67-73; 2009: 10-15). [[The goal is 'integral reality', a
limitless]{.mark} [operational project geared towards the total
transcription]{.mark} [of the world into virtuality]{.mark}:
**'everything is realised and technically materialised without reference
to any principle or final purpose'**]{.underline} (2005: 18). Yet [there
is **an internal war or "backlash**" taking place between integralist
violence which seeks ultimate control by eliminating all otherness, and
**duality**]{.underline}. **[Duality]{.underline}**, for Baudrillard,
**[is "indestructible" and is manifest as the inevitable or destined
re-emergence of otherness: of death, Evil, ambivalence, the ghosts of
symbolic exchange, the accursed share within the system]{.underline}**.
**[The integrating system then suffers a 'dissent working away at it
from inside]{.underline}**. **[It is the global violence immanent in the
world-system itself which, from within, sets the purest form of symbolic
challenge against it']{.underline}** (2005: 22). [This is a war or
conflict that does not end, the outcome of which cannot be predicted or
programmed. **It is a war that is quite different from the disappearance
of war into simulated non-events, such as occurred with the Gulf
wars**]{.underline} (Baudrillard 1995). Indeed, Baudrillard suggests,
[**the deterrence** of world wars, and of nuclear wars, **does not
result in peace, but in a viral proliferation of conflicts, a
fractalisation of war and conflict into everyday, local, and ubiquitous
terror**]{.underline} (1993b: 27). This paper will examine Baudrillard's
position on internal rejection through two closely related themes:
complicity and duality. [[Complicity, and]{.mark} the closely related
term [collusion, are]{.mark} themselves [dual]{.mark}]{.underline} in
Baudrillard's sense. That is, [complicity or collusion express **an
internal division or 'duality'** which is **not a simple opposition of
terms**]{.underline}. As is so often the case, Baudrillard's position
builds on his much earlier studies: Requiem For the Media (orig. 1972,
in Baudrillard 1981: 164-184) had already argued that the dominance of
the abstract sign and of simulation models meant that **[any critique of
the system made through the channels of semiotic abstraction were
automatically re-absorbed into the system]{.underline}**. **[Any
meaningful challenge must invent its own, alternative medium -- such as
the silk-screen printings, hand-painted notices and graffiti of May 1968
-- or it will lapse into an ineffectual complicity with the system it
seeks to challenge]{.underline}** (Baudrillard 1981: 176). In his later
work, Baudrillard's emphasis on duality and complicity is extended much
further, taking on global, anthropological and even cosmological
dimensions, and increasingly complicity and collusion are seen as dual,
as encompassing both acceptance and a subtle defiance. This paper
examines the dual nature of complicity and collusion. It considers the
influence of La Boetie's notorious Essay on Voluntary Servitude on
Baudrillard, seeking to draw out what is distinctive in Baudrillard's
position. The second section turns to the notion of duality, examining
Good and Evil and Baudrillard's assertion that attempts to eliminate
duality merely revive or re-active it. Complicity implies a complexity
of relations, and, specifically, the condition of being an accomplice to
those in power. To be an accomplice is to assist in the committing of a
crime. If the crime is murder, the term accomplice implies one who
plans, reflects, calculates -- but does not strike the lethal blow. The
crime which is of particular interest to Baudrillard is, of course, the
perfect crime: the elimination of otherness, of ambivalence, of duality,
even of "reality" and of the abstract representational sign which
enables a sense of "reality" (Baudrillard 1996). The global, integral,
carnivalising and cannibalising system, which might loosely still be
called capitalist, is at war against radical otherness or duality; yet,
for Baudrillard, as duality lies at its heart, locked within its
foundations, it is indestructible and emerges through attempts to
eliminate it. If the system has been largely successful at eliminating
external threats, it finds itself in an even worse situation: it is at
war with itself. II. Complicity Complicity is a particularly slippery
term. In the 1980s Baudrillard's thought, mistakenly assumed to be
"Postmodernist", was argued to be complicit with capitalism, largely
because it questioned the ability of dominant strands of Marxism and
feminism to significantly challenge the capitalist system (Callinicos
1989; Norris 1992). At the same time, Baudrillard was alleging that the
work of supposedly radical theorists such as Deleuze and Guattari (1984
orig. 1972) and Lyotard (1993 orig. 1974) was, with their emphasis on
desire as productive and liberatory force, complicit with the mechanisms
of advanced consumer capitalism (Baudrillard 1987: 17-20). So which
branch of contemporary theory is most complicit with capitalism?
Liberals, humanists and environmentalists who see their clothes stolen
by mainstream politicians? Marxists and Communists who by refusing to
update their thinking provide a slow moving target for right-wing
snipers? Post- Modernists and Post-Structuralists who attack
Enlightenment thought but refuse to speak of the human subject and so
have "thrown the baby out with the bath water"? Network and complexity
theory which flattens all phenomena and experience to a position on a
grid, producing a very complex simplification? **[The list could go on
but it is a question that cannot be answered because [all critical
theories are complicit with the system they
critique]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [They **fight on a terrain** already
**demarcated** by their **opponents**, a terrain on which they are
**beaten before they begin**, one where the most compelling argument can
always be **dismissed as doom-mongering or irresponsible**
intellectualism. This includes **Baudrillard's own critical thinking**,
as he **readily acknowledges**]{.underline} (Baudrillard 2009a: 39).
Further, and [**even more damaging to the project of critique**, in a
hegemonic or integral order [the system **solicits critique and it
criticises itself**, so]{.mark} **displacing** and [**making redundant
the laborious attempts** at **academic critique**]{.mark}. The latter
continue, even proliferate, but **with decreasing impact**.]{.underline}
So, what does Baudrillard mean by complicity with the global order?
[[Baudrillard's concern is]{.mark} primarily [with **complicity at the
level of the form**]{.mark} of the (capitalist) system, [not]{.mark} at
the level of belief, consent or allegiance to particular
[content]{.mark}s of capitalist life]{.underline} (consumer products,
plurality of 'lifestyles', a degree of 'tolerance' etc.). [Complicity is
often seen, by critics of capitalism, as acceptance of consumerism and
its myriad choices and lifestyles, but this is a reductive level of
analysis from Baudrillard's perspective]{.underline}. [By
[complicity]{.mark} or collusion Baudrillard
[means]{.mark}]{.underline}, on the one hand, **[[the]{.mark} very
widespread [willingness to surrender]{.mark} or give up beliefs,
passions and "symbolic defences]{.underline}**" (2010: 24), [and on the
other]{.underline} -- [as the dual form]{.underline} -- **[an equally
widespread ability to find a space of defiance through the play of
complicity, collusion, hyperconformity and indifference]{.underline}**
(1983: 41-8). That is, [while many of us (in the relatively affluent
West) share in the profanating, denigrating and "carnivalising" of all
values, embracing indifference, shrugging "whatever", we do so with very
little commitment to the system, rejoicing inwardly when it suffers
reversals: **we operate in a dual mode**]{.underline}. [While such
**attitudes of indifference** may seem to accept that there is no
meaningful alternative to capitalism: an attitude that has been called
**'capitalist nihilism'**]{.underline} (Davis in Milbank and Zizek,
2009) **[and 'capitalist realism']{.underline}** (Fisher 2008),
[Baudrillard's notions of **"integral reality",** **duality** and
**complicity** may have **significant advantages** over those
approaches]{.underline}. [Unlike thinkers who remain **anchored to
critical thinking** defined by **determinate negation**, Baudrillard's
approach **emphasises ambivalence**, **reversal** and both **personal
and collective modes of rejection** more **subtle** than those
envisioned by the **increasingly exhausted mechanisms of
critique**]{.underline}. [The **critique of consumer
capitalism**]{.underline} -- **[the consumption of junk food, junk
entertainment and junk information]{.underline}** -- [is]{.underline}
now [integral to the system; the critique of finance capitalism --
banker's bonuses, corporate tax avoidance -- is integral to the system,
yet it fails to bring about meaningful or determinate social
transformation]{.underline}. Indeed, [[such critiques]{.mark} may [do
**no more than provide the system** with a **fleeting sense of
"reality**]{.mark}" -- **[real issues]{.mark}**, **real problems to deal
with** -- [around which the system can **reproduce its
simulacra**]{.mark}, perhaps [to **reassure us that "something is being
done"**]{.mark}, **"measures are being put into place"**
etc]{.underline}. "[Reality" cannot be dialectically negated by critical
concepts when both 'reality' and the critical concept disappear
together, **their fates clearly tied to each other**]{.underline}
(Baudrillard 2009b: 10-12). There is a sense then in which [**the
production of critique is in complicity with the system**, the
unravel-able proliferation and excess of critical accounts of the system
has the effect of protecting the system]{.underline}. Complicity
consists in a sharing of the denigration of all values, all
institutions, all ideas, all beliefs: so long as we believe in nothing
-- at least not passionately -- then the system has us, at least
superficially. For example, in recent decades we have seen the
denigration of religious faiths -- or their reduction to 'cultural
identity' and 'world heritage' objects; the denigration of public
services and welfare provision accompanied by their marketisation; the
denigration of the poor, the young, immigrants and the unemployed. Yet
this is not only the denigration of the powerless or disenfranchised,
there is also the widespread denigration of those seen as powerful:
politicians, corporations, celebrities. For Baudrillard, [it is **quite
inadequate** to focus only on **the power of global neo-liberal
policies** such as marketisation in these processes of denigration. This
is where Baudrillard's position departs decisively from anti-globalists
and from neo-Communists such as Negri, Zizek, and Badiou]{.underline}.
[[Global power]{.mark} has **deliberately sacrificed its values and
ideologies**, it **presents no position**, it **takes no stand**, it
**undermines even the illusion that "free markets" function and [has
made "capital" virtual]{.mark}**; become orbital it is removed from a
terrestrial, geo-political or subjective space. These are **protective
measures enabling power to become (almost) hegemonic**]{.underline}
(Baudrillard 2009a: 33-56; 2010: 35-40). [Baudrillard]{.underline} often
[emphasises **the fragility and the vulnerability** to **reversal of the
"powerful"** and the distinction between powerful and powerless is
**radically questioned in his work**. So what is this global
[power]{.mark}? Where is it? The answer, of course, is that **it [is
everywhere]{.mark} and it is in everyone**]{.underline}. [We have not
liberated ourselves from slavery, but]{.underline}, Baudrillard
contends, **[internalised the masters]{.underline}**: ['\[e\]verthing
changes with **the emancipation of the slave** and the **internalisation
of the master by the emancipated slave'**]{.underline} (2009a: 33).
[**We tyrannise ourselves**, for example by demanding that we **maximise
our opportunities, fulfill our potential**. This is **a deeper level of
slavery** -- and **complicity** -- than **any previous historical system
could inflict**]{.underline} (Baudrillard 1975; 2009a: 33). Yet
**[duality always re-emerges]{.underline}**, Baudrillard insists:
[indifference is dual, complicity is dual]{.underline}.
[**Carnivalisation** and **cannibalisation** are themselves **dual**:
the global system **absorbs all otherness** in a **'forced conversion to
modernity'**]{.underline} (2010: 5), [**reproducing otherness** within
the **carnival of marketable "difference**", yet **cannibalisation
emerges as a reversion** and **derailing of this process**]{.underline}.
The world adopts Western models: economic, cultural, religious -- or it
appears to. [Hidden within this complicity with the West, there
is]{.underline}, Baudrillard suggests, **[a deeper sense of derision and
rejection]{.underline}**. [The allegiance to Western models is
**superficial**; it is **a form of mimicry or hyperconformity** that
involves a **ritual-like exorcism of the hegemonic
system**]{.underline}. Further, [such **mimicry reveals the
superficiality of Western cultural and economic models**: this is not
only a superficial acceptance, but **an acceptance of
superficiality**]{.underline}. [Western values **are already parodic**,
and, in being accepted, they are **subject to further parody** as they
circulate around the globe]{.underline} (2010: 4-11). [The West has
**deregulated and devalued itself** and demands that the rest of the
world follows]{.underline}: \"It is everything by which a human being
retains some value in his own eyes that we (the West) are deliberately
sacrificing ... \[o\]ur truth is always to be sought in unveiling,
de-sublimation, reductive analysis ...\[n\]othing is true if it is not
desacralised, objectivised, shorn of its aura, dragged on to the stage\"
(Baudrillard 2010: 23). [Western desacrilisation amounts to a powerful
challenge to the rest of the world, a potlatch: desacralise in return or
perish! But who has the power? Who is the victor? **There isn't
one**]{.underline}, according to Baudrillard. [Of the global
order]{.underline}, Baudrillard writes: '[**[We are]{.mark} its
hostages** -- **victims and accomplices** at one and **the same time**
-- [immersed in the **same global monopoly of the networks**]{.mark}. A
monopoly which, moreover -- and this is the supreme ruse of hegemony --
no one holds any longer]{.underline}' (2010: 40). [There is **no
Master**, **no sovereign** because **[all the structures]{.mark} and
dictates** of power [have been **internalised**]{.mark}, [this is **the
complicity we all share with global order**]{.mark}, yet it is **a dual
complicity**: an **over-eager acceptance** goes hand-in-hand with **a
deep and growing rejection**]{.underline}.

#### We ought not seek meaning, but only to squander it. In order to challenge the system, we must begin with the level of form, the Code, not its representational contents. Our performance of radical theory is one that shatters the very possibility of reifying the coded and economic meaning of engagement within debate. Absent a poetic nullification of the code all attempts at resistance remain binary and banal. We must challenge the semiotic medium through which politics is filtered.

Baudrillard on Hatred and Difference [In recent sociological literature,
[hatred is understood as the result of an entrenched structure of
difference which imposes a normative and hierarchical order on those who
appear to be 'different']{.mark}]{.underline}[. [Those who benefit most
from established social and economic structures: **white, middle-class
heterosexual males,** exercise and reinforce their position of dominance
through a wide range of oppositions with each pair consisting of
positive and negative terms. Hence black, female, gay, become the
negative terms by which white, male and straight define and maintain
their identities as superior]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Since such identity
positions are not naturally superior they require the maintenance of
boundaries separating them ideologically from their opposite
term]{.underline}. Identity and difference are mutually reinforcing and
difference tends to be reduced to a subordinate, supplementary or
supporting role. Further, such accounts assert, in times of stress, loss
of status (such as loss of employment, or difficulty in securing
meaningful employment) those in a privileged position will vent their
frustrations on those who are 'different' (Perry 2001). More recently,
sociological accounts have stressed the importance of the emotional
bonds which link the hater with whomever or whatever they hate (Alford
1998; Scheff and Retzinger 2001). The hater is thereby revealed to be in
a situation of weakness and dependence which tends to further enrage
them. [Many writers then enjoin a celebration of 'difference' or
'diversity' such that difference can be either revealed as really rather
similar to identity -- as in many multiculturalist arguments -- or
alternatively 'difference' is celebrated as 'different' but not
lesser]{.underline}. In both of these accounts there is usually some
appeal for greater education or information on 'cultural difference' and
better or more positive media representations of 'difference'. This
section examines how the ideas of Bataille and Baudrillard depart from
these trends. Hatred, for Bataille, is a powerful, enduring though
derivative and mobile psychological attitude. Hatred is not an affect or
drive, but a restricted, accumulated rag-bag of sentiments. Such
sentiments parallel capitalist values in that they consist of
ideological and representational claims which are extremely reductive,
in particular, they reduce human being to the state of a productive
instrument, and further in their accumulative form and refusal of
generosity and reciprocity. [For Baudrillard, hatred is a far more
supple relation than the term 'bond' suggests; it is so readily
channelled, re-directed, switched or substituted. In the destructured,
implosive and limitless system that dominates contemporary life the
hater does not necessarily even require an object or 'other' to hate, or
an identity position to protect or affirm. In his re-thinking of hate
Baudrillard asks]{.underline}, provocatively, **[[is it some version of
difference or otherness that suffers the rage of haters, or is it rather
those who are perceived and positioned as "dangerously
similar]{.mark}"]{.underline}** (1993b: 129). **[The category of [the
"dangerously similar" includes those who]{.mark} have been [forcibly
deprived of their difference by the globalising of simulatory Western
values]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} For Baudrillard, **[[we are all
haters, not because of some innate 'badness' of human nature, but
because we live in a system that encourages hate and thrives upon its
channelling]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Both Bataille and Baudrillard then
take hatred very seriously, aiming to theorise it in its intensity and
power and avoiding facile social prescriptions concerning social
progress through better representation or education. The Code and its
Discriminations In For a Critique of the Political Economy of the Sign
(1981, orig. 1972) [Baudrillard began to describe various codes of
meaning (or signification) as integrated by what he called 'the
code']{.underline} ( le code, la grille, le Code du signes, la matrice
). [By "the code" Baudrillard intended not particular codes of meaning
(English, French, Morse) or particular modes of the interpretation of
meaning (dominant, resistant, plural) but rather **the condition of
possibility of coding**]{.underline} . 2 [[For an **effective critique
of the consumer society**]{.mark} to be made]{.underline}, Baudrillard
suggests, **[[we must focus analysis on the form of the Code, not its
contents]{.mark} or representations which are, of course,
extraordinarily open, malleable and diverse]{.underline}**. [The Code as
form is preconscious]{.underline}, or, in Baudrillard's terminology,
[has the effect of "precession]{.underline}"; that is, [as grid or
network it **precedes individual experience**]{.underline},
[perception]{.underline} and [choice]{.underline}. [The medium of this
grid is the abstract, arbitrary sign. Signs, visual and linguistic, are
**the medium of coding**, of the ordered exchange between coded
elements]{.underline}. [Composed to two sets of inter-locking relations,
the sign-referent and signifier-signified, [the sign is the universal
form constructing the **oppositions of subject and object, of real and
representation, of self and other**: **the building blocks of 'reality'
itself**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} **[[The ordered exchange of
signs produces identity and difference]{.mark}: [every 'thing' is
semiotic;]{.mark} every 'thing' is a 'thing' because it is not some
other 'thing]{.underline}**'. [Signs produce social meanings and values
on a scale or grid whereby **all points can be measured and
compared**]{.underline}. To clarify, [it is not that every 'thing' can
be converted into sign form, it is rather that [the very process
of]{.mark} transcription or [coding **produces 'things' within a scheme
of identities and differences**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Though the Code
encompasses every 'thing' it cannot process symbolic exchange,
seduction, the ambivalence (or becoming) of life which consist not
'things' with identity but of volatile relations, always "in transit" or
metamorphosis]{.underline}. The Code then does not merely express
particular aspects of the consumer capitalist system such as media,
fashion or advertising: it is far more fundamental. [At the fundamental
level the Code is what prevents symbolic exchange by breaking its cycles
or by seizing and diverting its potential]{.underline}. **[[Symbolic
exchange now occurs or rather "effracts" only when the Code and its
value systems are annulled, reversed or
suspended]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Symbolic exchange **traverses all
oppositions, challenging fixed or stable positions or power
relations**]{.underline}. Baudrillard's major example of symbolic
exchange is, of course, the gift and counter-gift discussed in Chapter
2. To reiterate, [the meaning of the gift never settles into fixity or
identity, it is not structured by a logic of difference, its meaning can
be transformed at any moment in the on-going relation or "pact" between
parties -- indeed this relation is of the gift and the gift is of this
relation: relation and gift flourish together, and die
together]{.underline}. [Baudrillard defines the Code as a "generalised
metaphysics" synthesising social values, social production and social
identities, and this system ends any sense of the social as dynamic,
symbolic form]{.underline}. [[The Code enacts an "obligatory
registration of individuals on the scale of status]{.underline}]{.mark}"
(1981: 68), [[producing a "hierarchy of differential signs"
which]{.underline}]{.mark}, crucially, "**[[constitutes the fundamental,
decisive form of social control]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- **[more so
than acquiescence to ideological norms]{.underline}**" (ibid.). [It
**makes no difference** whether we, as individuals, **endorse the
consumer capitalist system or not**, since we are all positioned by the
Code]{.underline}, and [are positioned through it by
others]{.underline}[: **[the game of ideological critique takes place
within the terms set by the Code]{.underline}**]{.mark}. **[The Code
breaks, blocks and bars ambivalence producing the structure of
difference -- the play of identity and difference characterised by
oppositions such as true/false, good/evil, self/other, black/white,
male/female]{.underline}**. The standard dimensions of consumer status
positioning flow from this source: rich/poor, young/ old, fat/thin,
attractive/unattractive. [While structural or dialectical oppositions
are characteristic of the first and second orders of simulacra, in the
third order the Code simulates choice, difference and diversity through
binary "modulation" by allowing the privileged terms of its oppositions
to switch, fuse or "implode]{.underline}" (1983: 95-110). For example
'fat', 'poor' and 'old' can be beautiful too -- if only within the
confines of fashion, cosmetics advertising or pop music video. **[[The
Code operates in "total indifference" to content]{.underline}]{.mark}**;
[everything is permitted in sign form; that is as
"simulation]{.underline}". The Code also performs a pacifying effect on
society: the once clear-cut, structural divisions such as class and
status are made less visible by registering all people as individual
consumers on a single, universal scale. Everyone becomes a consumer,
though some, of course, consume far more than others. As universal form
the status of consumer confers a kind of democratic flattening of social
relations, but an illusory one. If class conflict was, to some extent,
pacified, Baudrillard does not contend that society as a whole is
pacified; indeed [other forms of violence and dissent emerge and cannot
be deterred]{.underline}. [Baudrillard wrote of the emergence of new
"anomalous" forms of violence, less intelligible, less structured,
post-dialectical or implosive]{.underline} (Baudrillard 1998a: 174-85;
1994: 71-2)). **[He refers to the Watts riots of 1965 as an example of
new violent rejections of the consumer system]{.underline}**. Later,
[Baudrillard proposed the term "disembodied hate" or simply "the hate"
to express aspects of this process]{.underline} (1996a: 142-7). **[The
Code then is a principle of integration producing everything and
everyone as a position on the scale of social value]{.underline}** .
With the last vestiges of symbolic orders around the world being
eliminated by neo-liberal economic globalisation how is the Code to be
challenged or defied? 3 Departing from the form but not the intent of
Marxist theory, Baudrillard argued that the apparent distinction between
use value and economic exchange value is produced as a "code effect". In
other words, use value is a simulatory form produced by the capitalist
system as justification and grounding for its trading of economic
exchange values (1981: 130-42). For Baudrillard [the illusion of use
value, like the illusion of signified meanings and the illusion of the
stable solid reality of the referent, are produced by the Code as
structural groundings, shoring up the unstable 'reality' of signs and
preventing the emergence of ambivalence]{.underline} (1981: 156 n.9). To
challenge, defy or breach the Code then it is not sufficient to 'return'
to use value. Indeed such strategies, shared by some Marxists,
environmentalists and anti-globalisation movements actually feed the
capitalist system: the market's semiotic assimilation of
environmentalism as the 'green' brand choice is an obvious example. But
if Marxist theory fails to engage with and challenge the system of
signs, so too, for Baudrillard, do many Structuralist, Poststructuralist
and Postmodernist theorists of desire, difference and liberation. **[[To
defy the system it is never sufficient to 'play with
signs']{.underline}]{.mark}**, that is, [to play with plural,
'different' or multiple identity positions]{.underline}. Here [we
encounter Baudrillard's total rejection of what would later be [called
'identity politics']{.mark} and]{.underline} also [a central
misunderstanding of his position on signs]{.underline}. 4 [For
Baudrillard [to play with signs]{.mark} -- signs of consumption and
status, signs of gender, sexuality or ethnicity [is **simply to operate
within the Code**]{.mark}]{.underline} [. **[It is an unconscious or
unwitting complicity with the Code's logic of the multiplication of
status positions]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[; it is, in a sense, to assist
it in the production of 'diversity' and 'choice']{.underline}**. It is
deeply ironic that some of Baudrillard's critics have claimed that
Baudrillard himself merely 'played with signs' and that he advocated a
playing with signs. Yet Baudrillard is clear, **[[in order to oppose the
system "\[e\]ven signs must burn]{.mark}"]{.underline}** (1981: 163). In
his controversial work Seduction (orig. 1979) Baudrillard draws an
important distinction between the "ludique" meaning playing the game of
signs, playing with signification (to enhance one's status position or
to assert one's identity through its 'difference'), and "mise enjeux"
meaning to put signs at stake, to challenging them or annul them through
symbolic exchange (1990: 15778). 5 For Baudrillard signs play with us,
despite us, against us; **[any radical defiance must be a defiance of
signs and their coding]{.underline}**s. Unfortunately, the distinction
between 'playing with signs' -- playing with their decoding and
recoding, and defying the sign system has not penetrated the mainstream
of Media and Cultural Studies. Eco's influential notion of "semiotic
guerrilla warfare" (Eco 1995) and Hall's even more influential notion of
"resistant decoding" place their faith in the ability of the sovereign,
rational consumer to negotiate mediated meanings. For them the
citizen-consumer confronts media content as the subject confronts the
object. Hall does not consider that [much media content is now
'**pre-encoded' in an ersatz 'oppositional' form** which renders the
moment of 'oppositional decoding' merely one of conformity or ironic
recognition]{.underline} (see Hall et al. 2002: 128-38). In other words,
**[the terms for 'resistant' readings can be pre-set as positions within
the Code]{.underline}**. [**[Critique is rendered uncertain, even
meaningless by coded assimilation because the system sells us the signs
of opposition as willingly as it sells us the signs of conformity; it
sells signs of inclusion and empowerment as eagerly as it sells signs of
affluence and exclusion]{.underline}**.]{.mark} Can we even tell them
apart? In which category would we place the phenomenon of Sex and the
City , for example? 6 Today, millions of people manage, archive and
share signs of their designated identity through social media platforms,
in Baudrillard's terms holding themselves hostage to the system of
signs. [The realm of symbolic exchange or seduction does not come about
when individuals 'play with signs' but when (signs of) individuality,
identity, will and agency are annulled through an encounter with radical
otherness]{.underline}. [[Radical otherness]{.underline}]{.mark}, or
radical alterity, for Baudrillard, **[[refers to otherness not
'difference']{.mark}, that is [otherness beyond representation, beyond
coding]{.mark}]{.underline}** -- [including 'oppositional' or assertive
de/re-codings]{.underline}. [A system of "total constraint" the Code
does not merely produce identity but also difference, diversity and
hybridity: indeed each of these now describe marketing
strategies]{.underline}. Of course, [the system does not seek to promote
passivity or apathy among consumers but quite the contrary: to thrive
and expand the system requires active, discriminating, engaged
consumers, jostling for position, competing for
advancement]{.underline}. The Code exists "to better prime the
aspiration towards the higher level" (1981: 60), delivering diversity
and choice at the level of signs or content (the goods that we choose to
eat, the products and services that we choose to wear, watch, download)
and it requires in return ... nothing much at all -- merely that we
understand ourselves as consumers . The aim of the system is to make
'the consumer' the universal form of humanity yet within this form an
almost infinite variety of differential contents or positions are
possible; homogenisation and diversification become indistinguishable.
Since 'humanity', for Baudrillard, as for Nietzsche, is already
constituted as a universal form by the Enlightenment (1993a: 50) this
task is close to completion, though the final completion, the "perfect
crime" against Otherness will never, according to Baudrillard, come to
pass (Baudrillard 1996a). 7 As a term the Code largely disappeared from
Baudrillard's writings after Simulacra and Simulation (1994). Are we to
take it that the Code is still operational in the "fourth order" or is
it defunct? We can answer this question by recalling two important
points. Firstly, Baudrillard did not contend that the pacification and
control effected by the Code would be total (quite the reverse, see
Baudrillard 1996a: 142-9; 1998a: 174-85), only that the Code aimed at
total constraint. [Baudrillard's most developed example, [the
masses]{.mark}, let us recall, are not so passive and docile that they
are manipulated by the system; rather, they [withdraw into silence or
practice a hyper-conformity without belief in, or commitment to, the
integrated system of values]{.mark}]{.underline}. In other words, [[they
refuse to be the active, discriminating, reflective consumers that the
system requires]{.underline}.]{.mark} Baudrillard writes "[We form a
mass, living most of the time in panic or haphazardly]{.underline} (
aleatoire ) [above and beyond any meaning]{.underline}" (1983: 15), [the
masses are clearly not only the poor and marginal, they are "us, you and
everyone]{.underline}" ( nous, vous, tout le monde ) (1983: 46; 2005b:
51). **[[This 'we' is not a rhetorical device used to assert a faux
value consensus; rather it suggests a buried, banished commonality, a
commonality of nothing except a shared rejection of systemic
control]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Everyone, as posited by the Code, is
mass ; both inside and, at the same time, beyond the Code: mass, yet
singularity]{.underline}. Secondly, in the late 1980s when Baudrillard
proposed a fourth order, a fractal stage with "no point of reference",
where "value radiates in all directions" as a "haphazard proliferation"
(Baudrillard 1993b: 11) he was clear that the previous orders continue
to function alongside the fourth order. In other words, there are still
dialectical tensions operating, associated with the second order, and
the Code of the third order also flourishes. Indeed what is most
distinctive about the fourth order is that: things continue to function
long after their ideas have disappeared, and they do so in total
indifference to their content. The paradoxical fact is that they
function even better under these circumstances (Baudrillard 1993b: 6).
The idea or principle of the Code then is dead, but it functions even
more effectively than ever, it becomes virtual, it produces "integral
reality" as the complete and final replacement for the world as symbolic
form (Baudrillard 2005a: 17-24). [**[The Code, simulation and virtuality
become so dominant, so global, that overt forms of resistance or
counter-systemic violence are absorbed within it]{.underline}**.]{.mark}
[Countersystemic violence might be given a (safe) place to play out
through the media and entertainment industries, or it might be
neutralised by the system offering a simulated, commodified version of
what protesters and dissenters demand -- this was how the sexual
revolution was neutralised]{.underline}, according to Baudrillard.
However, [new forms of violence **emerge from within saturated,
controlling and dissuasive systems, intra-genic forms** which,
Baudrillard suggests, seem to be "**secreted" by the system itself** as
it reaches a bloated, excessive or "hypertelic" state]{.underline}. "The
hate" is one example of such intra-genic violence. Racism, Indifference
and "the Hate" The whole art of politics today is to whip up popular
indifference (Baudrillard, Cool Memories II , 1996b: 16) What then is
the relationship between the Code and violence and hatred? [The Code
both pacifies and produces hate]{.underline}; indeed [it produces hatred
through pacification]{.underline}. [While consumer capitalism
has]{.underline}, to some extent, [achieved a pacifying effect on
'structural' hatred such as the racism of skin colour, the system
generates new hatreds and new violence that cannot be 'treated' by
socialisation, education and information]{.underline}. [On racism
specifically Baudrillard argues: Logically, it \[[racism\] **should have
declined** with the **advance of Enlightenment and democracy**. Yet the
**more hybrid** our cultures become]{.mark}, and the more the
theoretical and genetic bases of racism crumble away, [the **stronger**
it grows]{.mark}. But [this is because we are dealing here with a mental
object, with an artificial construction based on an erosion of the
singularity of cultures and entry into the fetishistic system of
difference]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [So long as there is **otherness,
strangeness** and]{.underline}]{.mark} [the (possibly violent) **[dual
relation]{.mark}** -- as we see in anthropological accounts up to the
eighteenth century and into the colonial period -- [there **was no
racism**]{.mark} properly so-called ... [all forms of sexist, racist,
ethnic or cultural discrimination arise out of the same profound
disaffection and out of a collective mourning for a dead otherness, set
against a background of general indifference]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Baudrillard 199a6: 132). If the systemic violence of difference is
ameliorated, at least in the world of signs and in what people are
prepared to state openly, the post-dialectical violence of indifference
seems to grow in intensity. The violence of in-difference or "the hate"
is like an antibiotic resistant virus, a hospital 'superbug': it cannot
be treated by the standard measures because the over-use of those very
measures helped to produced it (Baudrillard 1996a: 142-7; 2005a:
141-55). [The Code's vast edifice of signs -- **"the fetishistic system
of difference"** -- diversifies and assimilates producing 'positive'
representations at the same time as the divide, both economic and
cultural, between rich and poor deepens and ramifies]{.underline}.
**[The edifice of signs actually "deters", prevents or displaces the
possibility of genuine social progress by delivering "simulated" social
progress: signs of equality, signs of inclusion, signs of
empowerment]{.underline}**. Baudrillard's contends that [**[this
"indifferent" society is based on the expulsion of all forms of "radical
otherness": foreignness, death, madness, negativity, 'evil', even the
radical otherness of language is dismantled by linguistics and
informationalisation]{.underline}**.]{.mark} [Such societies
are]{.underline}, broadly, '[**tolerant'** but this means simply that
there is a widespread indifference to the other]{.underline}. So long as
the other conforms to the agenda set by liberal capitalism -- a life
reduced to usefulness, productivity, and distinctive regimes of
consumption -- that is, [so long as the other remains fundamentally the
same , the other is tolerated]{.underline}. **[[Difference is tolerated
so long as it remains within the identity/difference binary
opposition]{.mark}, difference being plotted from the standards of
sameness and identity]{.underline}**. In a sense, [difference and
indifference become indistinguishable: minorities are tolerated in their
difference when they can offer certain superficial differences within
the consumer system: different food, different music, different clothes,
different 'culture']{.underline}. Indeed 'culture' is increasingly
understood as the inessential markings of certain groups: it is
commonplace to hear talk of club culture, organisational culture, gay
culture and these generally refer to nothing more than the current
styles of speech, aesthetic preferences and consumption practices of
these groups. [T**[he society of indifference generates a new and
insidious form of racism]{.underline}**]{.mark}. [The "indifferent
society" is not one where 'anything goes' or where there are no systemic
exclusions, quite the reverse: **["the whole movement of an indifferent
society ends in victimhood and hatred]{.mark}"**]{.underline}
(Baudrillard 1996a: 131). What he calls [the "negative passion of
indifference" involves a "hysterical and speculative resurrection of the
other]{.underline}" (1996: 131). [This artificial other is "idealised by
hatred", by condescension or pity -- **[the other becomes
fetish]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Racism is desperately seeking the other
in the form of evil to be combated]{.underline}. **[[The humanitarian
seeks the other just as desperately in the form of victims to
aid]{.underline}]{.mark}** ... \[.\] [The scapegoat is no longer the
person you hound, but the one whose lot you lament]{.underline}. But he
is still a scapegoat and he is still the same person (Baudrillard 1996:
132). [**[Hatred is secreted by the modern, liberal, indifferent
reconstruction of the Other as other]{.underline}**. **[This "negotiable
other" is promoted, even celebrated but only through a compulsory
registration on a single scale of identity/difference, a scale by which
the other is assimilated, measured and judged]{.underline}**]{.mark}.
Indeed, for Baudrillard, **[[this compulsory registration constitutes "a
subtler form of extermination" than structural
racism]{.underline}]{.mark}** (1993b: 133). [[The
other]{.underline}]{.mark} -- the lower case, similar, yet marginally
different other -- [[is scapegoated by humanitarianism in search of an
object of pity, by politicians seeking opportunities for televised
performances of contrition, by the media seeking sensational and
calamitous tales]{.underline}]{.mark}. But [this is not simply misjudged
charity, well-meaning but ineffective, the fetishising of the other
serves a deeper purpose]{.underline}. [**[Western power brokers urgently
require an injection of reality, of real reality to shore up their
public relations campaigns, their regimes of simulation, and the other
as victim can be made to provide precisely this]{.underline}**.]{.mark}
Western politicians and corporations seek to "import their force and the
energy of their misfortune" (Baudrillard 1996a: 134). [[The disastrous
other of the 'third world' provides useful cover for the operation of
neo-liberal and neo-conservative economic, cultural and military
policies which maintain the third world in its]{.mark} disastrous, but
to them, [usefully disastrous condition. **"The
hate",**]{.mark}]{.underline} as Baudrillard figures it, **[[cannot be
broken down and understood through the structural or binary oppositions
of self and other, black and white, inside and
outside]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The hate does not emanate from a
recognisable position: a self, an ideology, a discourse or a culture,
nor does it emerge from the ideology or culture of the other. The verb
'to hate', like the self or ego has been liberated and become
autonomous: uprooted it flows and seeps crossing any boundary, any limit
(Baudrillard 2005c: 141). [The hate is networked, it travels at the
speed of information, it has not one object or target but all and any;
because it is not, primarily, hatred of something or someone, it is not
reflective or critical nor does it propose alternatives]{.underline}.
Having no definite object, goal or purpose, no programme or ideology,
[the hate is a particularly intractable and corrosive form of hatred. If
these ideas appear rather formalistic or abstract, it is surprisingly
easy to generate illustrative examples. If we take the violent protests
by some Muslim groups, provoked by the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten
publishing cartoons of the prophet Mohammed in 2005, what precisely was
the object of the protesters' hate]{.underline}? It was not a particular
newspaper, it was not the Danish state or people, it was, perhaps, not
even 'The West' as such, **[[it was the dominance of a system of
representation that recognises no outside, no sacred, no 'beyond', that
reduces all meanings, beliefs and sensations to
signs]{.underline}]{.mark}**. 9 To give other examples: [the middle
classes hate and fear the 'hoodie' or the baseball-capped 'chav'; the
BNP (British National Party) hate 'Muslims' though, increasingly, they
'tolerate' Hindus and Sikhs; motorists and air passengers suddenly
experience "the hate]{.underline}". These hates do not follow the limits
of self and other, inside and outside, they are far more mobile and
tactical; they flare up and then vanish or mutate before reappearing
without warning. Yet, what Baudrillard's position suggests is that we
(in the sense noted above) do not hate the Other -- the radically Other,
we merely hate the other -- as transcribed through the Code as
'difference'. Thus transcribed an individual person is merely a
conglomeration of signs which fabricate their 'reality' their 'culture'
-- and if this is what we are reduced to, why wouldn't we hate each
other? [The Code then reduces the radically Other to the "dangerously
similar": dangerously similar because others differ only in sign content
or position]{.underline} (Baudrillard 1993b: 129). [In our superficial
acceptance of the Code we hate (and we do all hate) the other as sign ,
as merely a signified 'reality']{.underline}. We encounter an other who
is no more than the 'reality' of their signification; at best we are
indifferent to the other and tolerate them. Indeed, we cannot but be
indifferent to the other because it is through indifference that we
tolerate.

### Radical Thought

#### We affirm the [unknowable and indecipherable]{.underline} play of language. Happily embracing the felicitous and enigmatic play of language is necessary for debate to [mean anything again]{.underline}. This is also the [only political act that remains]{.underline} in a system over-coded by Sameness and Intelligibility.

**Baudrillard 96** Jean, PhD in Sociology, Professor of Philosophy at
the European Graduate School, *The Perfect Crime*, translated by Chris
Turner, pp. 102-104

[**What are we to do, then?** [What becomes of the heterogeneity of
thought]{.mark} in a world won over to the craziest hypotheses? [When
everything conforms]{.mark}, beyond even our wildest hopes, [to
the]{.mark} ironic, critical, alternative, [catastrophic
model]{.mark}]{.underline}[?]{.mark}

Well**[, that is paradise: we are beyond the Last Judgement, in
immortality]{.underline}**. [The only problem is to survive
there]{.underline}. For [there the irony, the challenging, the
anticipation, the maleficence come to an end]{.underline}, [as
inexorably as [hope dies at the gates of]{.mark} hell]{.underline}. And
**[it is indeed there that hell begins]{.underline}**, [the hell of the
unconditional realization of all ideas, [the hell of the
real]{.mark}.]{.underline} You can see why, as Adorno says, concepts
prefer to scupper themselves rather than reach that point.

[[Something]{.mark} else [has been stolen]{.mark} from us:
**[indifference]{.mark}**. The power of indifference, which is the
quality of the mind, as opposed to the play of differences, which is the
characteristic of the world]{.underline}. Now, [this has been stolen
from us by a world grown indifferent]{.underline}, as the extravagance
of thought has been stolen from us by an extravagant world. When things,
events, refer one to another and to their undifferentiated concept, then
the equivalence of the world meets and cancels out the indifference of
thought \-- and we have boredom. [No more altercations; nothing at
stake. It is the parting of the dead sea]{.underline}.

How fine indifference was in a world that was not indifferent \-- in a
different, convulsive, contradictory world, a world with issues and
passions! That being the case, indifference immediately became an issue
and a passion itself. It could preempt the indifference of the world,
and turn that pre-emption into an event. Today, it is difficult to be
more indifferent to their reality than the facts themselves, more
indifferent to their meaning than images. Our operational world is an
apathetic world. Now, **[what good is it being passionless in a world
without passion, or detached in a world without desire?]{.underline}**

**[[It is not a question of defending radical thought. Every idea one
defends is presumed guilty]{.mark}, and every idea that cannot defend
itself deserves to disappear]{.underline}**. On the other hand, one must
fight all charges of irresponsibility, nihilism or despair. [Radical
thought is never depressive]{.underline}. On this point, [there is total
misunderstanding]{.underline}. [[Ideological and moralistic critique,
obsessed with meaning and content, obsessed with the political finality
of discourse, **never takes into account writing, the act of writing,
the poetic, ironic, allusive force of language, of the juggling with
meaning**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [It does not see that [the resolution of
meaning is to be found there \-- in the form itself]{.mark}, the formal
materiality of expression.]{.underline}

[**[Meaning,]{.mark} for its part, [is always unhappy]{.mark}**.
[Analysis is, by definition, unhappy, since it is born of critical
disillusionment. But language]{.mark}, for its part, [is **happy**, even
when referring to a world without illusion and without
hope]{.mark}]{.underline}[. **[That might]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[even
[be the definition of a radical thinking: a happy form and]{.mark} an
[intelligence without hope]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}

[[Critics]{.underline},]{.mark} being [unhappy by nature]{.underline},
[always choose ideas as their battleground]{.underline}. [They [do not
see that if discourse always tends to produce meaning, language and
writing]{.mark}, for their part[, **always create
illusion**]{.mark}]{.underline} [\-- [they are the living illusion of
meaning, the resolution of the infelicity of meaning by the felicity of
language]{.underline}.]{.mark} And **[[this is surely the only
political]{.mark} \-- or transpolitical \-- [act that can be
accomplished]{.mark} by the person who writes.]{.underline}**

[[As for ideas, everyone has]{.mark} them. **[More than they
need]{.mark}**]{.underline}[. **[What counts is the poetic singularity
of the analysis]{.underline}**.]{.mark} [That alone can justify writing,
not the wretched critical objectivity of ideas. There never will be any
resolving the contradictoriness of ideas, except in the energy and
felicity of language]{.underline}. \`I do not paint sadness and
loneliness,\' says Hopper. \`What I wanted to do was to paint sunlight
on the side of a house.\'

[At any rate, [better a despairing analysis in felicitous language than
an optimistic analysis in an infelicitous language that is maddeningly
tedious and demoralizingly platitudinous,]{.mark} as is most often the
case.]{.underline} The absolute tediousness secreted by that idealistic,
voluntaristic thought is the secret sign of its despair \-- as regards
both the world and its own discourse. [That is where true [depressive
thought is]{.mark} to be [found, among those who speak]{.mark} only
[of]{.mark} the transcending and [transforming of the world, when they
are incapable of transfiguring]{.mark} their own
[language.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[Radical thought is a stranger to]{.mark} all [resolving of the world
in]{.mark} the direction of [an objective reality and its deciphering.
It does not decipher]{.mark}. It **anagrammatizes**, [it **disperses
concepts and ideas**]{.mark} and, by its reversible sequencing, [takes
account both of meaning and of the **fundamental illusoriness of
meaning**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Language takes account of the
very illusion of language as definitive stratagem and, through it, of
the illusion of the world as infinite trap, as seduction of the mind, as
spiriting away of all our mental faculties. [**[While it is a vehicle of
meaning, it is at the same time a superconductor of illusion and
non-meaning]{.underline}**. [Language]{.underline} [is
merely]{.underline} **[the involuntary accomplice of
communication]{.underline}**]{.mark} \-- by its very form it appeals to
the spiritual and material imagination of sounds and rhythm, to the
dispersal of meaning in the event of language[. [This passion for
artifice, for illusion, is the passion for **undoing that**]{.underline}
]{.mark}**[too- [beauteous constellation of
meaning]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [And [for letting the imposture of the
world show through, which is its enigmatic function, and the
**mystification of the world**, which is its
**secret**]{.underline}]{.mark}. While at the same time letting its own
imposture show through \-- the impostor, not the composteur \[composing
stick\] of meaning. [[This passion has the upper hand in the free and
witty use of language]{.mark}, in the witty play of writing. [Where that
artifice is not taken into account, not only is its charm lost, but the
meaning itself cannot be resolved.]{.mark}]{.underline}

**[[Cipher, do not decipher]{.mark}. Work over the
illusion]{.underline}**. **[Create illusion to create an
event]{.underline}**[. **[Make enigmatic what is clear, render
unintelligible what is only too intelligible, make the event itself
unreadable]{.underline}**]{.mark}. [Accentuate the false transparency of
the world to spread a terroristic confusion about it, or the germs or
viruses of a radical illusion]{.underline} \-- in other words, **[a
radical disillusioning of the real]{.underline}**. **[Viral, pernicious
thought, corrosive of meaning, generative of an erotic perception of
reality\'s turmoil]{.underline}**.

### War Against the Real

#### Theory must wage war on the reality principle, ciphering instead of deciphering the Event so that it cannot be terrorized by the hegemony of the code. Our semiotic insurrection performatively enacts an intervention into the real that shatters what was once self-evidence into so many shards of confusion.

[[The **production of war signs** is linked to the issue of war]{.mark}
not only [in]{.mark} matters of [content, but also]{.mark} **in matters
of [form]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [Content-wise, war is just one
of many fields in which reality signs are produced; regarding its
form]{.underline}, however, **[[it is the pure logic of war itself that
works]{.mark} in this industry]{.underline}**. **[[The production of
reality]{.underline}]{.mark}** for Baudrillard **[[is a kind of
warfare]{.mark} itself]{.underline}**: [Not only is it a monologue of
power, a "speech without response]{.underline}", as he states in Requiem
for the Media (1971: 172); [even more, **[the "terrorism of the
code"]{.mark}**]{.underline} (ibid.: 179) [**[is a war-like attack on
our senses]{.underline}**.]{.mark}

[**We, the viewers, are targets of a bombardment of signs and images**.
"Semiocracy"]{.underline}, Baudrillard (1976: 78) [calls this terror in
his writing on the New York Graffiti scene: [**we live under a
dictatorship of signs** (against which **the Graffiti raise their
anti-semiotic counterforce**)]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [The war sign
industry]{.underline}]{.mark} [is just one of many subdivisions of a
society-wide **'reality sign industry'** that **[floods our lives with
all kinds of spectacular products and
information]{.mark}**]{.underline}[. "[We are **all hostages of media
intoxication, induced to believe in the war**]{.underline}]{.mark} [just
as we were once led to believe in the revolution in Romania, [and
**confined to the simulacrum of war as though confined to
quarters**]{.mark}. We are already all strategic hostages in situ; our
site is the screen on which we are virtually bombarded day by
day]{.underline}" (Baudrillard 1991b: 25).

[Finally now, this is where Baudrillard's genuine theoretical
intervention takes place]{.underline}. **[Like the Graffiti writers,
[Baudrillard attempts to fight back against the terrorism of the code
and its work of purification---somehow continuing Graffiti writing by
other means]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Baudrillard is [leading his
own]{.mark} war, **his own [counter-guerilla warfare]{.mark}** [against
**the reality principle**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} What are his
spray cans? Which are the walls on which he puts his 'mark on society'?
[It is the holy walls of theoretical discourse that Baudrillard defaces
with **[a low tech weapon called "theoretical
terrorism"]{.mark}**]{.underline}, as he called it once (Baudrillard
1983a: 91, my translation)---**[a thinking [made to oppose, to challenge
the hegemony of reality]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}

[The idea of 'theoretical terrorism' is strongly linked to his concept
of
"[reversibility]{.mark}]{.underline}"[13](http://www.ubishops.ca/baudrillardstudies/vol-11_2/v11-2-strehle.html#ft-endnote13) ---a
key term in Baudrillard's thinking. [The term may be characterized by
two main aspects: At first, it refers to the reciprocity of gift
exchange in which there is no closure of exchange but an endless
changing and challenging of sides]{.underline}. In this regard, **[it
[is a name for the symbolic fluidity of
power]{.mark}]{.underline}**.[14](http://www.ubishops.ca/baudrillardstudies/vol-11_2/v11-2-strehle.html#ft-endnote14) 
[At second, it refers to [a principle of changing a situation by
radically reversing its viewing angle---"**poetic transference of the
situation**]{.mark}]{.underline}["]{.mark}, as Baudrillard calls it
in Impossible Exchange (1999: 85).

Being a rather "phantastic principle" (Zapf 2010: 145, my translation),
[the concept of reversibility is linked with the most powerful and yet
most clandestine subtext in Baudrillard's oeuvre:
**'Pataphysics**]{.underline}. [The idea behind this absurd science of
"imaginary solutions" is as simple as it is mysterious: **It is an
attempt [to create a different reality through
imagination]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark}[15](http://www.ubishops.ca/baudrillardstudies/vol-11_2/v11-2-strehle.html#ft-endnote15) 
**[[Pataphysicians fight reality]{.mark} through the use of imaginary
forces, through [creating illusion and deceit]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

It is easily overlooked how central this pataphysical approach has been
for Baudrillard; even his most serious book, Symbolic Exchange and
Death, is surprisingly full of pataphysical statements, especially in
the dense, programmatic introductory pages: "[**The only strategy
against the hyperrealist system** is **some form of pataphysics**, 'a
**science of imaginary solutions'**; that is, **a science-fiction of the
system's reversal against itself** at the **extreme limit of
simulation**, a **reversible simulation** in **a hyperlogic of death**
and **destruction**]{.underline}" (Baudrillard 1976: 4 f.).

How can "science-fiction" shatter the system of reality? Baudrillard
explains his strategy later in The Perfect Crime (1995), especially in
the section on "Radical Thought", and in Impossible Exchange (1999).
[**[Ideas]{.underline}**,]{.mark} he claims, **[[can create their own
reality, since thinking is a performative act t]{.mark}hat builds its
own 'parallel world']{.underline}**: "[Thought \[...\] **does not seek
to penetrate some mystery of the world**, nor to **discover its hidden
aspect**---**it is that hidden aspect**]{.underline}. [It **does not
discover** that **the world has a double life**---**it is that double
life**, that **parallel life**]{.underline}" (Baudrillard 1999: 149).
[In the performative "act of thinking]{.underline}" (ibid.: 115),
**[[reality is not so much depicted but
challenged]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[The purpose of theory]{.mark} for
Baudrillard is **the exact opposite** of what we normally would expect:
It **s[hould not recognize and analyze reality]{.mark}**[, instead **it
must deny and contradict its hegemony**]{.mark}]{.underline}[. **[It has
to create illusion and establish a power of seduction that makes one
lose the path of reality]{.underline}**]{.mark}. [The "value of
thought]{.underline}", claims Baudrillard (1995: 94), "[lies not so much
in its inevitable convergences with truth as in **the immeasurable
divergences which separate it from truth**]{.underline}."

Only in awareness of those abstract 'Pataphysics can we distill any
sense out of some of the oddest remarks in Baudrillard's oeuvre, for
example his "delirious self-criticism" from Cool Memories where he
accuses himself of "having surreptitiously mixed my phantasies in with
reality" and of "having systematically opposed the most obvious and
well-founded notions" (Baudrillard 1987: 38). He even complains about
readers taking his theories for actual facts and reading them in a
"realist version": "Simulacra are today accepted everywhere in their
realist version: simulacra exist, simulation exists. It is the
intellectual and fashionable version of this vulgarization which is the
worst: all is sign, signs have abolished reality, etc." (Ibid.: 227).

Instead of this "realist version", [Baudrillard suggests that even his
most prominent terms can be regarded as pataphysical attempts to seduce
his readers through fictitious ideas]{.underline}, for example [when he
admits to having "put forward the idea of simulacrum, without really
believing in it, even hoping that the real will refute it]{.underline}"
(Baudrillard 1995: 101). Apparently [he understands his thinking to be
**something like a playful simulacrum itself**, for also **theory can
precede**---and thereby **seduce**---**reality**]{.underline}: "[The
theoretical ideal would be to set in place propositions in such a way
that they could be **disconfirmed by reality**, in such a way that
**reality could only oppose them violently**, and thereby **unmask
itself**]{.underline}. **[For reality is an illusion, and all thought
must seek first of all to unmask it]{.underline}**. To do that, [it must
itself **advance behind a mask** and **constitute itself as a decoy**,
without regard for its own truth. \[\...\] **Reality must be caught in
the trap**, we must **move quicker than reality**]{.underline}" (ibid.:
99).

In this sense, **[Baudrillard's writing is
"theory-fiction]{.underline}**" (Baudrillard 1991c: 202) [rather than
theory]{.underline}, as he borrows a term from Jean-François Lyotard
(1979: 92 f., cp. Blask, 2002: 133).  [Like all 'Pataphysics, this
notion of "theory-fiction" may be traced back to [the **surrealists**
and their "**poetic anthropology**]{.mark}]{.underline}[",]{.mark} as
Dietmar Kamper (1981, my translation) has called it. [Such an
anthropology is "poetic" because it refers to **the art of writing**,
but also because it **touches the original notion of "poiesis"**,
meaning **to create something**]{.underline}. '**[Poetic anthropology'
[do]{.mark}es [not seek to describe a reality that lies out
there]{.mark}, instead [it aims to autopoietically produce the subject
it writes about through its own act of
description]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}

[Theory]{.underline} for Baudrillard [is a **"paradoxical political
intervention"**]{.underline} (Zapf 2010: 241, my translation). [Thinking
itself has to become **the ambiguous kind of
"singularity"**]{.underline} (Baudrillard 1995: 96) [and
**"event"**]{.underline} (ibid.: 104) [that is **eliminated** from
almost **any other sphere of the system**]{.underline}: "[**[Cipher, do
not decipher]{.mark}**. Work over the illusion. **Create illusion** to
**create an event**. [**Make enigmatic what is clear**, **render
unintelligible** what is only too intelligible, **make the event itself
unreadable**.]{.mark} Accentuate the **false transparency** of the
**world** to **spread a terroristic confusion about it**, or the **germs
or viruses** of **a radical illusion**---in other words, **a radical
disillusioning of the real."**]{.underline} (Ibid.: 104).

Maybe this is the most unique aspect of [Baudrillard]{.underline}'s
thinking altogether. He [is a thinker who **tries to think the world
different from what it actually is**]{.underline}. [He sees himself as
something like **a smuggler or drug dealer**, pushing **forbidden
items** on a "**black market in thought"**]{.underline} (Baudrillard
1999: 104), [promoting "**a clandestine trade in ideas**, of **all
inadmissible ideas**, of **unassailable ideas**, as the liquor trade had
to be promoted in the 1930s]{.underline}" (Baudrillard 1995: 104 f.).

[If Baudrillard is **the drug dealer of sociology**, what does this
imply for his analysis of war and his reference to the principles of
symbolic exchange and the duel form?]{.underline} [If]{.underline} we
want to believe [[Baudrillard]{.underline}]{.mark} that he [[is **not
interested in rehabilitating older wars**]{.mark}, we should read his
reference **systematically** rather than historically]{.underline}
[16](http://www.ubishops.ca/baudrillardstudies/vol-11_2/v11-2-strehle.html#ft-endnote16)---[there
might have **never been any historical war** as **glamorous and
honorable** as portrayed by Clausewitz anyway]{.underline}. Hence, [[the
introduction of symbolic exchange and the duel principle into the
analysis of war might be more like **a strategy to introduce a different
view of things **into the **common perception of war**]{.underline}. [It
delivers the **necessary contrast** against which the **aestheticized**,
**whitewashed reality** of the war can be **scrutinized and
deconstructed** as **not the only possible reality of
war**]{.underline}. [Only in **the light of its radical other** can the
**reality of war** be **denaturalized and revealed** as **a self-display
of power and hegemony**]{.underline}.]{.mark}

In this regard, [[Baudrillard has always remained a critical thinker who
seeks to **intervene into reality instead of just observing**]{.mark}
**it**]{.underline}. To the same degree [he is neither a cynic nor a
fatalist, that is---a resigned thinker]{.underline}. On the contrary, in
an interview on the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center he even
aligns himself with the ideas of the Enlightenment: "[Fatalism offers an
unpalatable interpretation of the world, for it leads to resignation. I
don't resign myself, I want clarity, a lucid consciousness. When we know
the rules of the game, then we can change them. In this respect, **I am
a man of the Enlightenment**]{.underline}" (Baudrillard 2002b). There is
one major difference, though, between Baudrillard and the classical
Enlightenment: [[He wishes for "clarity" and lucidity, he wants to "know
the rules of the game", but he **does not seek the truth**; **he wants
to "change" the rules of the game by diverting the game from its
truth.**]{.underline}]{.mark}

[It does not seem to matter]{.underline} so much to Baudrillard
[if]{.underline} his instance of [contrast]{.underline}---[symbolic
exchange and the duel principle---is more fictitious or real,
illusionary or true; most possibly it has **something of both sides**,
being **undecidable** like a **simulacrum** in the strongest
sense]{.underline}. [When Baudrillard writes about **the Gulf War**, he
creates **an odd mixture of lucid observations** on the one hand and
**theoretical seductions** on the other]{.underline}. [If there could
ever be something like **'war studies'** in the spirit of Baudrillard,
they would have to **dare not to eliminate this undecidability**,
otherwise **they would lose the spirit**.]{.underline}

**[[What matters]{.mark} the [most]{.mark} for Baudrillard [is the
effort to break open the uniform process of reality production and
shatter its seeming self-evidence into pieces]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
**[Theory]{.underline}** according to Baudrillard [is an attempt
to **reverse our view of the world**---**shifting our perspective** by
**introducing something new and unsettling** into **the order of
things**]{.underline}. [What **seemed natural before**, now starts **to
look artificial**; what **presented itself as a glorious triumph**
suddenly **appears stale**; **what was evident becomes
shady**]{.underline}. **[Baudrillard's theories are like evil ghosts:
They haunt reality by staging its excluded other---no matter if this
other really exists or if it has to be feigned.]{.underline}**

# Bataille CP??

### "organisation pik"

#### CP: \[plan text but remove O from NATO\]

#### That solves.

**Bataille 45** (Georges, tried to remove his head, On Nietzsche, 1945,
edited for language)

"**[[Life]{.underline}]{.mark}**.\" I said. \"**[[is bound to be lost in
death]{.mark}, as a river loses itself in the sea, [the known in the
unknown]{.mark}]{.underline}**\" (Inner Experiena). And death is the end
life easily reaches (as water does sea level). So why would I wish to
turn my desire to be persuasive into a worry? I dissolve into myself
like the sea-and I know the roaring waters of the torrent head straight
at me! Whatever a judicious understanding sometimes seems too rude, an
inunense folly connected with it (understanding is only an infinitesimal
part of that folly), doesn\'t hesitate to give back. [The certainty of
incoher· ence]{.underline} in reading, [[the inevitable crumbling of the
soundest constructions, is the deep truth]{.underline}]{.mark} of books.
Since appearance constitutes a limit, [what truly exists is a
dissolution into common opacity rather than a development of lucid
thinking.]{.underline} The apparent unchangingness of books is
deceptive: [[each book is]{.mark} also [the sum of]{.mark} the
[misunderstandings]{.mark} it occasions]{.underline}. So why exhaust
myself with efforts toward consciousness? [I can only make fun of myself
as I write]{.underline}. ([Why write even a phrase if laughter doesn\'t
immediately join me?)]{.underline} It goes without saying that, for the
task. I bring to bear whatever rigor I have within me. But the crumbling
nature of thinking\'s awareness of itself and especially the certainty
of thinking reaching its end only in failing, hinder any repose and
prevent the relaxed state that facilitates a rigorous disposition of
things. Committed to the casual stance-l think and express myself in the
free play of hazard.) Obviously, [[everyone]{.mark} in some way
[admits]{.mark} the importance of [hazard]{.mark}.]{.underline} But this
recognition is [[as minimal]{.mark} and unconscious [as
possible]{.mark}]{.underline}. Going my way unconstrained, unhampered. I
develop my thoughts, make choices with regard to expression-but I don\'t
have the control over myself that I want. And the actual dynamic of my
intelligence is equally uncontrollable. So that l owe to other
dynamics-to lucky chance and to fleeting moments of relaxation-the
minimal order and relative learning that I do have. And the rest of the
time . . . Thus, as I see it my thought proceeds in harmony with its
object, an object that it attains more and perfectly the greater the
state of its own ruin. Though it isn\'t necessarily conscious of this.
At one and the same time my thinking must reach plenary illumination and
dissolution . . . In the same individual, [[thought must construct and
destroy itself]{.underline}]{.mark}. And even that isn\'t quite right.
[Even the most rigorous thinkers yield to chance]{.underline}. In
addition, the demands inherent in the exercise of thought often take me
far from where I started. One of the great difficulties encountered by
understanding is to put order into thought\'s interrelations in time. In
a given moment, my thought reaches considerable rigor. But how to link
it with yesterday\'s thinking? Yesterday, in a sense, I was another
person, responding to other worries. Adapting one to the other remains
possible, but . . . This insufficiency bothers me no more than the
insufficiency relating to the many woes of the human condition
generally. Humanness is related in us to nonsatisfaction. a
nonsatisfaction to which we yield without accepting it, though; we
distance ourselves from humanness when we regard ourselves as satisfied
or when we give up searching for satisfaction. Sartre is right in
relation to me to recall the myth Of Sisyphus, though \"in relation to
me\" here equates to \"in relation to humanity,\" I suppose. What can be
expected of us is to go as far as possible and not to stop.
**[[What]{.underline}]{.mark}** by contrast, humanly speaking, **[[can
be criticized are endeavors whose only meaning is some relation to
moments of completion]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Is it possible for me to
go further? I won\'t wait to coordinate my efforts in that case-I\'ll go
further. I\'ll take the risk. And the reader, free not to venture after
me, will often take advantage of that same freedom! The critics are
right to scent danger here! But let me in turn paint out a greater
danger, one that comes from [methods]{.underline} that, adequate only to
an outcome of knowledge, [confer on individuals whom they limit a
sheerly fragmentary existence]{.underline}-an existence that is
mutilated with respect to the whole that remains inaccessible.

### Extensions

#### There was only one debate to be had, that of being versus becoming. 

**Bataille 39** (Georges, leader of a secret society, "The Labyrinth",
<https://onscenes.weebly.com/philosophy/the-labyrinth-georges-bataille>,
1927-1939) \*we don't endorse gendered language

The Insufficiency of Beings [[MEN ACT IN ORDER TO BE]{.mark}. This
must]{.underline} not [be understood]{.underline} in the negative sense
of conservation (conserving in order not to be thrown out of existence
by death), but [[in the positive sense of a tragic and incessant
combat]{.underline}]{.mark} for a satisfaction that is almost beyond
reach. From incoherent agitation to crushing sleep, from chatter to
turning inward, from overwhelming love to hardening hate, existence
sometimes weakens and sometimes accomplishes \"being.\" And not only do
states have a variable intensity, but different beings \"are\"
unequally. A dog that runs and barks seems \"to be\" more than a mute
and clinging sponge, the sponge more than the water in which it lives,
an influential man more than a vacant passerby. ​In the first movement,
where the force that the master has at his disposal puts the slave at
his mercy, the master deprives the slave of a part of his being. Much
later, in return, the \"existence\" of the master is impoverished to the
extent that it distances itself from the material elements of life. The
slave enriches his being to the extent that he enslaves these elements
by the work to which his impotence condemns him. ​[The [contradictory
movements of degradation and growth attain]{.mark}, in the diffuse
development of human existence, [a bewildering
complexity]{.mark}]{.underline}. The fundamental ​separation of men into
masters and slaves is only the crossed threshold, the entry into the
world of specialized functions where personal \"existence\" empties
itself of its contents; [[a man is no longer anything but a part of
being]{.mark}, and [his life]{.mark}, engaged in the game of creation
and destruction that goes beyond it, [appears as a degraded particle
lacking reality]{.mark}]{.underline}. The very fact of assuming that
knowledge is a function throws the philosopher back into the world of
petty inconsistencies and dissections of lifeless organs. Isolated as
much from action as from the dreams that turn action away and echo it in
the strange depths of animated life, he led astray the very being that
he chose as the object of his uneasy comprehension[. \"[Being]{.mark}\"
increases in the tumultuous agitation of a life that knows no limits; it
[wastes away and disappears]{.mark} if he who is at the same time
\"being\" and knowledge mutilates himself by reducing himself to
knowledge]{.underline}. ​This deficiency can grow even greater if the
object of knowledge is no longer being in general but a narrow domain,
such as an organ, a mathematical question, a juridical form. Action and
dreams do not escape this poverty (each time they are confused with the
totality of being), and, in the multicolored immensity of human lives, a
limitless insufficiency is revealed; [[life]{.mark}, finding its
endpoint in the happiness of a bugle blower or the snickering of a
village chair-renter, is no longer the fulfillment of itself, but [is
its own ludicrous degradation]{.mark}-its fall is comparable to that of
a king onto the floor]{.underline}. ​At the basis of human life there
exists a principle ofinsufficiency. In isolation, each man sees the
majority of others as incapable or unworthy of \"being.\" There is
found, in all free and slanderous conversation, as an animating theme,
the awareness of the vanity and the emptiness of our fellowmen; an
apparently stagnant conversation betrays the blind and impotent flight
of all life toward an indefinable summit[. ​The sufficiency of each being
is endlessly contested by every other]{.underline}. Even the look that
expresses love and admiration comes to me as a doubt concerning my
reality. A burst of laughter or the expression of repugnance greets each
gesture, each sentence or each oversight through which my profound
insufficiency is betrayed-just as sobs would be the response to my
sudden death, to a total and irremediable omission. This uneasiness on
the part of everyone grows and reverberates, since at each detour, with
a kind of nausea, [men discover their solitude in empty
night.]{.underline} The universal night in which everything finds
itself-and soon loses itself-would appear to be existence for nothing,
without influence, equivalent to the absence of being, were it not for
human nature that emerges within it to give a dramatic importance to
being and life. But this absurd night manages to empty itself of
\"being\" and meaning each time a man discovers within it human destiny,
itself locked in turn in a comic impasse, like a hideous and discordant
trumpet blast. That which, in me, demands that there be \"being\" in the
world, \"being\" and ​not just the manifest insufficiency of human or
nonhuman nature, necessarily projects (at one time or another and in
reply to human chatter) divine sufficiency across space, like the
reflection of an impotence, of a servilely accepted malady of being. II.
The Composite Character of Beings and the Impossibility of Fixing
Existence in Any Given Ipse [Being in the world is so
uncertain]{.underline} that I can project it where I want-outside of me.
It is a clumsy man, still incapable of eluding the intrigues of nature,
who locks being in the me. **[[Being in fact is found
NOWHERE]{.underline}]{.mark}** and it was an easy game for a sickly
malice to discover it to be divine, at the summit of a pyramid formed by
the multitude of beings, which has at its base the immensity of the
simplest matter. Being could be confined to the electron if ipseity were
precisely not lacking in this simple element. The atom itself has a
complexity that is too elementary to be determined ipsely.\' [The number
of particles that make up a being intervene]{.underline} in a
sufficiently heavy and clear way in the constitution of its ipseity; if
a knife has its handle and blade indefinitely replaced, it loses even
the shadow of ipseity; it is not the same for a machine which, after
five or six years, loses each of the numerous elements that constituted
it when new. But the ipseity that is finally apprehended with difficulty
in the machine is still only shadowlike. Starting from an extreme
complexity, being imposes on reflection more than the precariousness of
a fugitive appearance, but this complexity-displaced little by
little-becomes in turn the labyrinth where what had suddenly come
forward strangely loses its way. [​A sponge is reduced by pounding to [a
dust of cells]{.mark}; this living dust [is formed by a multitude of
isolated beings, and is lost in the new sponge that it
reconstitutes]{.mark}.]{.underline} A siphonophore fragment is by itself
an autonomous being, yet the whole siphonophore, to which this fragment
belongs, is itself [hardly different from a being possessing
unity.]{.underline} Only with linear animals (worms, insects, fish,
reptiles, birds, and mammals) do the living individual forms
definitively lose the faculty of constituting aggregates bound together
in a single body. But while societies of nonlinear animals do not exist,
superior animals form aggregates without ever giving rise to corporeal
links; men as well as beavers or ants form societies of individuals
whose bodies are autonomous. But in regard to being, is this autonomy
the final appearance, or is it simply error? In men, all existence is
tied in particular to language, whose terms determine its modes of
appearance within each person. Each person can only represent his total
existence, if only in his own eyes, through the medium of words. Words
spring forth in his head, laden with a host of human or superhuman lives
in relation to which he privately exists. Being depends on the mediation
of words,which cannot merely present it arbitrarily as \"autonomous
being,\" but which must present it profoundly as \"being in relation.\"
One need only follow, for a short time, the traces of the repeated
circuits of words to discover, in a disconcerting vision, the
labyrinthine structure ofthe human being. **[[What is commonly called
knowing]{.underline}]{.mark}**-when a man knows his neighbor-**[[is
never anything but existence composed for an
instant]{.underline}]{.mark}** (in the sense that all existence composes
itselfthus the atom composes its unity from variable electrons), which
once made of these two beings a whole every bit as real as its parts. A
limited number of exchanged phrases, no matter how conventional,
sufficed to create the banal interpenetration of two existing juxtaposed
regions. The fact that after this short exchange the man is aware of
knowing his neighbor is opposed to a meeting without recognition in the
street, as well as to the ignorance of the multitude of beings that one
never meets, in the same way that life is opposed to death. The
knowledge of human beings thus appears as a mode of biological
connection, unstable but just as real as the connections between cells
in tissue. The exchange between two human particles in fact possesses
the faculty of surviving momentary separation. [[A man is only a
particle inserted in unstable and entangled wholes]{.underline}]{.mark}.
These wholes are composed in personal life in the form of multiple
possibilities, starting with a knowledge that is crossed like a
threshold-and the existence of the particle can in no way be isolated
from this composition, which agitates it in the midst of a whirlwind of
ephemerids. This extreme instability of connections alone permits one to
introduce, as a puerile but convenient illusion, a representation of
isolated existence turning in on itself. ​In the most general way, every
isolable element of the universe always appears as a particle that can
enter into composition with a whole that transcends it. Being is only
found as a whole composed ofparticles whose relative autonomy is
maintained. These two principles dominate the uncertain presence of an
ipse being across a distance that never ceases to put everything in
question. [Emerging in universal play as unforeseeable
chance]{.underline}, with extreme dread imperatively becoming the demand
for universality, carried away to vertigo by the movement that composes
it, the ipse [being]{.underline} that [presents itself as]{.underline} a
universal is only a challenge to the diffuse immensity that escapes its
precarious violence, [the tragic negation of all that is not its own
bewildered phantom\'s chance]{.underline}. But, as a man, this being
falls into the meanders of the knowledge of his fellowmen, which absorbs
his substance in order to reduce it to a component of what goes beyond
the virulent madness of his autonomy in the total night of the world.

#### The great tragedy of modern warfare is its indifference and apathy. Utility slowly arises and suffocates all modes of relationality and expenditure, reducing all sacrifices to dull cyclical routine from its citizen-devotees -- yet like a tea-kettle, existence screams for release.

[Intricate unyielding systems of [rules and
regulations]{.mark}]{.underline}---passports, licenses, identity cards,
forms completed in triplicate, travel restrictions, immigration
regulations, police interrogations, surveillance of social and financial
transactions among subgroups, security checkpoints, departments of
homeland security---[[weed out the deviant
lifeforms]{.underline}]{.mark} until ultimately all countervoices have
been silenced, all rebellion quite obliterated, all evolutionary
movement logically contradictory. [[But]{.underline}]{.mark}, [at this
evolutionary apex, **[a problem arises in paradise]{.mark}**. As
[the]{.mark} monocephalic [state]{.mark} increasingly closes itself off,
it stifles social existence, smothers creative energies, [chokes the
passion from its citizen-devotees]{.mark}]{.underline}, suffocates their
spiritual urges, and [reduces all sacrifices to mundane
utility]{.underline}. When the perfect eternality of the structure is
complete and the nation duly deified, all labors have become co-opted in
utter servitude. [Bataille names this]{.underline} culminating stage of
development, the peaceful, stable end sought by all states, in its most
excessive extrapolation---**[fascism]{.underline}**.
[[Ultimately]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, [[life]{.mark} and time
[must break free]{.mark} and move forward into futures. [This most solid
state holds firm for a short while only]{.mark}]{.underline}; then there
begins a condensation of forces. **[[Life]{.mark} rises up and [explodes
the suffocating stasis]{.mark}]{.underline}**, disintegrating the solid,
erect whole. [[Existence]{.mark} and liberty [flow forth in rage, blood,
tears, and passion]{.mark}]{.underline}. The death of God is complete.
For Bataille, [[these]{.mark} endless [cycles describe]{.mark} the
movement of [history]{.mark}]{.underline}: the [[erection of unitary
gods of knowledge]{.underline}]{.mark} and power
[[that]{.underline}]{.mark} ultimately [[ossify]{.underline}]{.mark}
into totalities, [[and then explode]{.mark} in hysterical, raging
catastrophes]{.underline}, releasing the explosive liberty of life from
mundane servitude. The [acephalic [chaos will eventually
recompose]{.mark}]{.underline}, slowly heaving up an ugly divine head
once again. [Life]{.underline} turns back on its chaotic freedom and
[develops]{.underline} what Bataille calls [an aversion to the initial
decomposition]{.underline}. The chaotic structure moves from the
ek-stasis bliss of wanton pleasures and pains toward the stasis of the
deity once again. [Time, states, and human individuals]{.underline}, for
Bataille, [move between the two contradictory forms: stasis and
ek-stasis. Time demands both forms in the world---the eternal return of
an imperative object, and the explosive, creative, destructive rage of
the liberty of life**. [Bataille]{.mark}'s analysis**]{.underline} of
state evolution [**[offers resolution to the mystery of the frequency of
wars in the modern civilized era]{.underline}**:]{.mark} It suggests
that [[war composes]{.underline}]{.mark} a "potlatch"---[a [manic
ecstasy of useless self-expenditure that permits a breakout from mundane
servitude]{.mark}]{.underline}. We may not readily recognize, in our
states, the extreme forms that Bataille describes---fascist stasis or
chaotic ecstasy. [[We believe that, although chaos is unquestionably
undesirable, fascism is promoted only by
madmen]{.underline}]{.mark}---Mussolini, Hitler, and Stalin. We may be
convinced that [fascist urges fade with global democracy where all
people will,]{.underline} eventually, [know the order and security of
the first world]{.underline}. [Modern Western states]{.underline}, we
may object, [compose a golden mean between Bataille's two
economies]{.underline}, aspiring neither to fascism nor to a manic
primitivism, but to the reasonable metron of golden rules. **[[But the
roots]{.mark} of the Western world [are well planted in the fascist
drive for hyper-order]{.mark} and changeless eternality]{.underline}**.
Hesiod and the PreSocratics, as much as Jewish and Christian myth, cite
a common arche of the universe in the good works of a god that renders
order (cosmos) out of chaos (kaos). For the ancients, one head
(cephalus) is far superior to many; simplicity is beauty, whereas the
many compose hoi poloi, an embarrassment of riches. [[The foundational
logic that posits monocephalic order as]{.mark} ontologically and
[morally superior]{.mark} to acephalic multivocity [remains]{.mark} an
[unquestioned]{.mark} assumption embedded in the Western lifeworld. A
single well-ordered edifice, stretching high into the sky---erect,
rigid, unyielding---is preferable, in the Western mind, to the broadest
playing field studded with incongruous heroics]{.underline}. Bataille's
[meditations on the dark underside of reason's projects and
triumphs]{.underline}, on such prohibited subjects as monstrous
tortures, illicit sexual excesses, and the colorful anuses of apes,
[provide a theater of cruelty and death]{.underline} that is designed to
challenge the polite threshold of civilized culture, to shock and
interrupt the philosophical tradition it invades, and [to subvert the
pretenses of refined sophistication]{.underline} thought definitive of
civilized society. Bataille shows that [[people are torn by conflicting
drives]{.mark}, by lofty ideals, and by the dark concealed forces they
suppress and deny]{.underline}. Lorenz states that Bataille's treatment
of [[the dark, concealed urges in human nature offer resolution to the
paradox]{.mark} of the simultaneous lofty goals [of]{.mark} modern
states and [the frequency of brutal aggressions by those very states
naming themselves the most civilized]{.mark}]{.underline}. Perhaps the
popularity and frequency of war even in the civilized modern era
represents the release of suppressed subterranean drives within
industrialized, rationalist, rigidly hierarchically ordered populations
enslaved to reason and utility. [[The violence that floods the globe in
modernity]{.mark}, that claims to be serving reasonable projects of
global freedom and democracy, [may represent new forms expressing old
desires]{.mark}]{.underline}, the projects of monocephalic statehood
aspiring to deification. Bataille recognizes chthonic forces as
instrumental in the modern world: "[The economic history of modern times
is dominated by]{.underline} the epic but disappointing
[effort]{.underline} of fierce men [to plunder the riches of the
Earth]{.underline} \[and turn its fire and metal into weapons\] \... .
\[M\]an \[lives\] an existence at the mercy of the merchandise he
produces, the largest part of which is devoted to death." The fierce men
of modernity---gods, kings, and their modern sequels (presidents, popes,
corporate rulers)---extend their control to the ends of the planet.
Fierce men disembowel the Earth and turn on their own kind the products
of molten metal torn from her bowels to ensure the permanence of their
nations. War, states Bataille, "represents the desperate obstinacy of
man opposing the exuberant power of time and finding security in an
immobile and almost somnolent erection." Bataille believes that
primitive urges are still at work in the projects of modernity. Human
beings, as much as superstructures of power, must satisfy their dark
urges for the good of their communities. They must release their death
drives if they are to gather together in heartfelt communities. [Human
beings crave mystical, passionate, frenzied escape from the rigorous
projects of their ordered systems]{.underline}. If Bataille is correct,
[[people must]{.underline}]{.mark} ultimately break free from the
mundane enterprises of their everyday lives. Their inner demons will
beckon them from their ordered worlds to revel in orgiastic festival.
Surely Bataille's claim---that life's erotic drives will out and
[[fulfill themselves in deathly destructiveness and wanton
joy]{.underline}]{.mark}---should trouble us greatly, given the leveling
effects of modern industrial society, its will to mediocrity, utility,
and conformity. But is Bataille correct in his attribution of a
measureless and rending character to modern war? Is modern warfare the
aimless catastrophe that Bataille claims it to be? If so, then modern
wars can be explained, according to Bataille, as ecstatic release from
the fascist orientation of modern ordered states and from people's
imprisonment within the merchandise they produce. [Modern war, with its
Shock and Awe techno-theatrics, should provide a wondrous release from
mundane servitude]{.underline}. War could be said to satisfy collective
fantasies of manic omnipotence and the drive for self-sacrifice for
sacred values. Perhaps the wars of modernity occur with such rabid
frequency because people must satisfy their suppressed lust for a
sexualized release from the cold reality of state projects, the
utilitarian reasons of state. This resonates with Clausewitz's claim
that people's martial enthusiasm must find release in politically
restrained wars or fulfill itself in the maximum exertion of
self-expenditure, that is, self-annihilation. For Clausewitz, modernity
represents that unfettered stage when war has escaped all political
bounds and reasonable restraint. Although ostensibly a world driven by
the lofty goals, modernity---for Clausewitz---composes an era of
absolute war. [The democratic revolution may have embraced other
goals]{.underline}---citizen welfare and the grandeur of their
rulers---[but [democracy]{.mark}]{.underline}, for Clausewitz, composes
merely one of a number of crucial forces (the scientific revolution that
provides the technology, the industrial revolution that provides mass
production of weaponry, and the imperialism that draws the entire globe
into the war system) that [h[ave been successfully harnessed to the
powerprojects of the mightiest nations]{.mark}]{.underline}. The goods
of the modern West, including the good of democracy, exist to extend
Western hegemony globally in the marketplace of military power. But
Bataille claims that war is useless expenditure---a release of the
primal urges of a community toward excessive overflow. He states:
"Military existence is based on a brutal negation of any profound
meaning of death and, if it uses cadavers, it is only to make the living
march in a straighter line." But, [if war is to be posited as an
ecstatic release, it must compose]{.underline} orgiastic overflow, an
[entirely useless and pointless expenditure]{.underline} of the nation's
finest goods. Excessive expenditure is defeated the moment the violent
explosion of forces serves mundane projects of servitude and utility.
When war serves the purposes of the state, it loses its manic and
ecstatic character and ceases to fulfill the people's deepest needs for
release from servitude and instrumentality. But Bataille is mistaken;
**[[the apparent uselessness of modern warfare is a deception]{.mark},
an illusion]{.underline}**. War is one of the oldest traditions of our
species. It has become a timeworn vehicle precisely because it serves a
great many functions in states. Clausewitz names the institution of war
a form of communication between nations. Franco Fornari states: "War is
a multifunctional institution. \... It is extremely difficult to find a
substitute that would perform all of its functions." One of the most
crucial functions that [war provides]{.underline} in service of [the
state]{.underline} is the crystallization of its [monopoly on
violence]{.underline}. War is a crucial aspect of the centralizing,
evolutionary process that culminates, ultimately, in fascist stability.
The establishment of a massive and robust military is utterly necessary
to the deification of the structure and the raising of a sturdy
cephalus, because, along with the creation of strong policing and
military forces, war serves to alienate the private violence of the
citizens and place their collective aggressive energies into the hands
of the cephalus. War serves the collective illusion of eternality.
[War]{.underline} serves other crucial functions in the state: it
[confirms the values, virtues, and meanings]{.underline} of one's own
cultural group. [Sacred symbols---flags, national anthems, tales of past
heroes, fallen ancestors---are put to work in luring the best of the
natio]{.underline}n---its strong and courageous
youths---[to]{.underline} the [extreme patriotism]{.underline} required
to maintain order in fascist regimes. The seduction of the nation's best
to its wars includes their provision of an international stage to
display the collective prowess of the nation, a point of pride for all
citizens, even the most oppressed of the society, and it allows for the
individual display of the soldiers' manly character---the valor, the
selflessness, the loyalty. The wars of modern super-states continue in
the tradition of imperialist projects of old. [Posited as serving the
most selfless values]{.underline}---the advancement of freedom,
democracy, and the spread of civilization---today's wars clearly bring
too massive a booty to be named selfless expenditures. In fact, for the
past fifty years, [[wars have increasingly become shameless
lootings]{.mark} of helpless peoples]{.underline}---the projects of
economists and accountants and big businessmen [[purified by political
propaganda]{.underline}]{.mark} and backed by an arsenal of modern
techno-weaponry. War serves the needs of the cephalus; it serves the
personal narcissism of the leaders, and the collective narcissism of the
combatants and civilians. Above all, **[[modern wars serve economic
goals; their booty is prodigious]{.underline}]{.mark}**. They may cost
the sacred love-object (the nation) massive capital, human and monetary,
but the generals, the political leaders, and their corporate cronies
profit handsomely from the hostilities. War also serves the fantasy that
the sacred love-object is the savior and benefactor of the globe; war
serves the paranoid collective delusion that the cephalus is infallible
and indestructible, unlimited as the god in its strength and in its
moral substance. Killing the enemies, propagandized as evil, the
collective illusion is fed that evil is overthrown: thus the sanctity of
the loveobject is preserved. Sacred values are recomposed; the cephalus
stands taller, more erect, more firm than ever in the wake of a good
war. But for all the benefits served by the institution of war, modern
wars are deeply tragic; they do waste millions of innocent lives; they
tear apart societies and disburse homeless families across the globe.
One in nine of the earth's seven billion now lives a miserable,
wandering, hopeless existence on parched lands where even the earth
mother is barren. Ultimately [[the greatest tragedy of modern war lies
in its]{.mark} stark [utility to the few at the]{.mark} extreme
[expenditure of its many]{.mark}. The utility of war defeats the
purposes of war by frustrating the deepest needs of the
society]{.underline}---[the people's need to build heartfelt
communities, a need that can only be served by expressing the collective
aggressive energies of the society beyond utility.]{.underline} Bataille
states that: "Since \[war\] is essentially constituted by armed force,
it can give to those who submit to its force of attraction nothing that
satisfies the great human hungers, because it subordinates everything to
a particular utility \... it must force its half-seduced lovers to enter
the inhuman and totally alienated world of barracks, military prisons,
and military administrations." In fact, it may well be [[the non-release
of ecstatic urges]{.mark} that [explains a state's return]{.mark}, year
after year and [decade after decade, to]{.mark} that old
institution]{.underline}. It may be that [the deepest paradox of [modern
war]{.mark} is that,]{.underline} [in]{.underline} its usefulness to the
cephalus and in [its service to the fascist drives of the
state,]{.underline} **[war proves utterly useless in]{.underline}**
dispensing its most fundamental function; it ceases to **[discharge the
most vicious and cruel needs of the people]{.underline}**, their deepest
primitive motivations, whose collective release makes possible the
formation of a heartfelt community. Bataille counts this failure as the
most tragic of the multiple tragedies of modern war. [The sacred values
of community---life]{.underline}, freedom, festival, and the
[joy]{.underline} of communal fraternity---[are rendered meaningful only
in juxtaposition to their opposites]{.underline}. Bataille states: "The
emotional element that gives an obsessive value to communal life is
death." But, ultimately, insists Bataille, the sacrifice will be
celebrated beyond the reasonable purposes of the cephalus. If Bataille
is correct, then we can be certain that[, [for those states whose wars
are utterly utilitarian, self-annihilation is
imminent]{.underline}.]{.mark}

In his most systematic effort to connect excess to politics, The
Accursed Share, Bataille (1988a: 7--15) addresses the problem of solar
economy (also described as 'general economy') as a background condition
for all organic and political life. [Instead of approaching economic and
politics from the perspective of exchange, [Bataille begins with the
surplus energy of the sun]{.mark}, which ceaselessly descends to the
planet's surface]{.underline}. For Bataille, [all ecologies, all
organisms, and therefore [all social systems are formed from]{.mark}
this [relentless]{.mark} [production of solar excess]{.mark}**.
[Classical]{.mark} studies of**]{.underline} economics and **[[politics
only focus on]{.mark} the patterns of]{.underline}** what he calls
'[**[restricted economies]{.underline}**']{.mark} while neglecting the
background conditions that give rise to their dynamics.1 [[Solar
economy]{.underline}]{.mark}, Bataille contends, **[[forces organized
systems]{.mark} of any complexity [to invent mechanisms for
expending]{.mark} or ridding themselves of excess]{.underline}**, since
the sun continually produces surpluses of energy.2 Bataille applies this
principle across multiple scales, from the reproduction of bacteria in
the form of scissiparity (cell division), to the ecstatic, wasteful
rituals of human sacrifice, to contemporary economic exchange. Each of
these processes is a form of expenditure that consumes or gets rid of
excess as a response to 'the circulation of energy at this point in the
universe' (Bataille, 1988a: 20, emphasis added). Bataille draws two
lessons from this observation. First, [any social system relies not only
on processes of production]{.underline}, the classic Marxist emphasis,
[but also on elaborate methods of consuming or expending
excesses]{.underline}. Second, [because solar economy constitutes a base
condition for life, the expenditure of excess also impacts questions of
value.]{.underline} Indeed, Bataille views many traditional ideals and
ideologies as antithetical to the condition of solar economy.
[[Paradigms that privilege rationality]{.mark}, calculation, [or
utility]{.mark}]{.underline}, for instance, [[presume the power to
measure]{.mark} and determine the ends of [any given political or
economic situation]{.mark}]{.underline}. While utility and rationality
work in the limited context of restricted economies, **[[solar economy
has no limits]{.mark} since it is defined by excess]{.underline}**;
there is always some part of it that is beyond human comprehension or
aspirations. Rationality, [utility, and [the preservation of the future
are]{.mark},]{.underline} at base, [ambitions [antithetical to the
excessive character of solar economy]{.mark}]{.underline}. In contrast
to these paradigms, [Bataille describes multiple societal mechanisms for
expending or consuming excess]{.underline}. The Accursed Share traces
these dynamics in historical contexts that include Aztec sacrifices,
potlatch practices, the rise of Islam, the Protestant Reformation, the
Industrial Revolution, communism, and **[modern warfare]{.underline}**.
Fully outlining each of these cases is beyond the scope of this article,
but Bataille (1988a: 27) clarifies that [all societies presuppose the
solar economy 'on which \[they\] depend, which \[they\] cannot limit,
and whose laws \[they\] cannot ignore without
consequences']{.underline}. In each case, **[[the organizing problem is
the question of 'how the wealth is to be
squandered']{.mark}]{.underline}** (Bataille, 1988a: 23). For Bataille,
**[[war constitutes]{.mark} a particularly important form of
[expenditure]{.mark}]{.underline}**. He highlights multiple elements of
armed conflict that facilitate expenditure at different historical
moments. [[Military action presupposes]{.mark} movement, flight, and the
[catastrophic loss]{.mark} in the irrecuperable force of
ballistics]{.underline} (Land, 1991: 40--42). Expenditures occur in the
intensities and frenzy of combat, which involve not only physical
volatility and waste but also the exposure of life to death without
recovery. From the edge of a blade, to the fragmentation of a bullet, to
[the explosion of an intercontinental ballistic missile]{.underline},
the use of weapons [involves non-recuperable expenditures of force that
are excessive in relation to the body they strike]{.underline} (Lambert,
2013). While armies tend to produce hierarchical organizational
structures and states often pursue war in order to accumulate, Bataille
believes that, underlying these dynamics, [war remains a mode of
expenditure]{.underline}. [Bataille]{.underline}'s position [is not an
attempt to naturalize warfare]{.underline}. Rather, he believes that
[[excess is a precondition for the development]{.mark} and innovation
[of human societies]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [The existence of excess
leads to]{.underline}]{.mark} contestations, excess human energy spent
in disputes over how to organize social affairs, and this, in the
extreme, also generates [[warfare]{.underline}]{.mark}. While war
entails certain violence, Bataille views it more fundamentally as a
creative process of expenditure in response to the pressures of solar
economy.3 [Bataille views the rise of modern industrial warfare as
reversing the relationship between war and the expenditure of excess by
transforming armed conflict into a rational exercise structured by
principles of utility and accumulation]{.underline}. Bataille interprets
the conjunction of capitalism, economic rationalization, and the rise of
the bureaucratic state as converting warfare into a means of
accumulation. Here is Bataille (1985: 200): '**[national and military
life are present in the world to try to deny death]{.underline}**. . ..
\[N\]ation and army profoundly separate man from a universe given over
to lost expenditures and to the unconditional explosion of its parts'.
Several arguments are implicit in this quote. First, [the accumulation
of martial forces during the early 20th century was bound to produce
large-scale conflict]{.underline} because [such processes]{.underline}
of accumulation [were inherently unstable since they were predicated on
controlling a volatile excess]{.underline} that would eventually produce
expenditure in the form of catastrophic loss of life. Second, [during
the rise of industrial warfare, armed conflict was slowly redefined to
make every form of expenditure into an opportunity for
accumulation]{.underline}. Third, this model of armed conflict loses
something crucial relative to earlier forms of warfare: 'dull war, such
as that organized by modern economics, also teaches the meaning of the
Earth, but it teaches it to renegades whose heads are full of
calculations and plans for the short run; that is why it teaches it with
a heartless and depressing rage' (Bataille, 1985: 201). Put differently,
Bataille argues that [[modern armed conflict]{.mark}, in spite of its
efforts to preserve]{.underline} and accumulate, nonetheless [[remains
dependent on solar economy]{.underline}]{.mark}. As such, **[modern
armed conflict also produces expenditures]{.underline}**. In the
historical context of industrial warfare, Bataille contends that [these
[expenditures manifested in the form of industrial detritus, massive
loss of life]{.mark}, and unprecedented cruelty]{.underline}. Bataille
defines heterology as 'the science of the heterogeneous . . . the
science of the excluded part' (Bataille, 2018: 31, emphasis added).
While Bataille traditionally uses this term to discuss the relationship
between the sacred and the profane, it also includes things out of
place, waste, and otherness, which cannot be incorporated into a
dominant social order. Put differently, Bataille (2018: 36) is asserting
that [[the rational organization of warfare]{.mark} according to the
logic of accumulation [cannot account for the production of unruly,
contingent violence]{.mark}]{.underline}. Since [modern
warfare]{.underline} cannot account for this form of violence, it
[disavowed]{.underline} the [untold deaths]{.underline} in the world
wars, [the cruel rationalization of suffering, the violent production of
the means of war, and the inability of these intensely violent episodes
to shift the organizing principles of modern societies]{.underline}.
**[[Modern warfare]{.underline}]{.mark}** thus **[did not eliminate
expenditure]{.underline}**. **[Instead]{.underline}**,
**[it]{.underline}** displaces and **[[disguises expenditure
in]{.mark}]{.underline}** the form of the destruction of **[[disposable
lives]{.underline}]{.mark}** or the relegation of forms of life to the
realm of the heterological. However, Bataille (2018: 36) also argues
that things banished to the realm of the heterological, from waste to
taboo erotic practices, incite new forms of desire by provoking
'hypnotic attraction'. In this way, Bataille contends that [modern
societies recreate strong attachments to warfare because war continues
to function as]{.underline} a limit experience, [an
encounter]{.underline} [with]{.underline} the heterological, opened up
by the expenditure of [excess]{.underline}. To unpack this point, it is
necessary to clarify Bataille's interpretation of the relationship
between sovereignty and excess and why, paradoxically, warfare engenders
sovereign experience. Bataille's understanding of sovereignty is opposed
to classical conceptions of the term. For Bataille, sovereignty is not
associated with legal dictates, personal power, or the capacity to kill.
Rather, sovereignty is an experience beyond 'the anguish of death'.
Bataille clarifies: 'Sovereignty has many forms: it is only rarely
condensed into a person and even then it is diffuse. The environment of
the sovereign partakes of sovereignty, but sovereignty is essentially
the refusal to accept the limits that the fear of death would have us
respect in order to ensure, in a general way, the laboriously peaceful
life of individuals' (Bataille, 1991a: 222, emphasis added). Sovereignty
surfaces in the incipient movements of expenditure, beyond utility or
rationality, where the anguish of death no longer matters. In these
moments, sovereignty emerges as an intensity that accompanies the
exposure to the contingency of death. This experience results from the
human encounter with 'base matter' that 'is external and foreign to
ideal human aspirations, and \[that\] refuses to allow itself to be
reduced to the great ontological machines resulting from these
aspirations' (Bataille, 1991a: 31). For Bataille, **[[sovereignty occurs
when life is no longer subservient to the demands of an
organized]{.mark} or ordered [end]{.mark}]{.underline}**. To underline
this point, he emphasizes that 'sovereignty cannot be the anticipated
result of calculated effort. . .. \[W\]hat is sovereign can only come
from the arbitrary, from chance' (Bataille, 1991a: 226, emphasis added).
As a mode of expenditure, war involves regular exposure to chance or
contingency and, accordingly, the experience of sovereignty. Bataille
goes so far as to argue that only warfare, eroticism, and death push
against that 'practice of reason \[through which\] we might believe in
the possibility of an ordering of all things, which would exclude risk
and caprice and would ground authenticity on nothing more than prudence
and the pursuit of usefulness' (Bataille, 1991a: 225). It is important
to note that [this process is, in epistemological terms,
qualitative]{.underline}. [There is no formula for producing
sovereignty]{.underline}, because to predetermine the emergence of
sovereignty would be to erase the contingency that is a condition of
possibility for such an experience. Bataille castigates **[[modern
societies]{.underline}]{.mark}** for making exactly this mistake. In his
reading, they **[[seek to eliminate contingency, which]{.mark}
ultimately [produces a much crueler disposition]{.mark}]{.underline}**
(Bataille, 1986: 78). For Bataille, **[war's cruelty is]{.underline}**
evident in **[the effort to manage, modify, and calculate the scope of
violence]{.underline}**: [Organized war]{.underline} withers efficient
military operations based not the discipline which when all is said and
done [excludes the mass of combatants from the pleasure of transgressing
the limits]{.underline}, has been caught up in a mechanism foreign to
the impulsions which set it off in the first place; war today has only
the remotest connection with war as I have described it; it is a dismal
aberration geared to political ends. (Bataille, 1986: 80) [[Modern
industrial warfare]{.mark} reflects not only the abandonment but also
the reversal of expenditure]{.underline} and, in doing so, the effort to
eliminate sovereign experience. For Bataille, [this process [is both
tragic and]{.mark}]{.underline} ultimately [[unsuccessful]{.mark},
because it merely displaces [the drive to expend]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Consequently, [this drive [reappears in the form of a desire for
sovereign experience]{.mark}.]{.underline} For Bataille, this drive is
**[[evident in the rise of social fantasies about war]{.mark} and an
almost covetous relationship between modern subjectivity and the
contingencies of the battlefield]{.underline}**. Moreover, contemporary
warfare's aesthetic obsession with cleanliness exhibits the qualities
that Bataille detests: [the removal of death, the erasure of
expenditure]{.underline} as a part of solar economy, [the sanitization
of]{.underline} the aesthetics and practices of [war]{.underline}, and
[the domestication of warfare and military organization]{.underline} in
order [to avoid any exposure to contingency]{.underline}. At the same
time, modern warfare cannot erase contingency and, therefore, retains
the possibility of generating sovereign experiences. This possibility,
Bataille maintains, explains why war continues to generate strong social
attachments as a space for transgression and expenditure. Such desires
are not, for Bataille, intrinsically problematic; rather, [the disaster
of modern industrial warfare results from the move to govern war
according to principles of utility]{.underline} and the attempt to
regulate the excessive dynamics of solar economy. Modern warfare,
informed by principles of accumulation and rationality, ultimately
incites these desires as a form of resistance to the world of utility.
These theoretical insights introduce new ways of reading multiple
aspects of late warfare. Excess, precision warfare, and the accident
Critical security scholars have frequently commented on the development
of precision and risktransfer warfare (Coker, 2009; Heng, 2006;
Rasmussen, 2006; Shaw, 2005). These studies illustrate how new
technologies, new rhetoric about technology and collateral damage, and
other paradigmatic changes to armed conflict mask the scale, regularity,
and intensity of violence in late warfare. Many of these arguments focus
on the discursive separation between the objectives and practices of
precision warfare, the reduction of lethal violence, and the outcomes,
namely, the production of precarious lives (Butler, 2004; Weizman,
2012). This section applies many of the insights of Bataille's work to
the context of precision warfare and the accident. The goal is to
illustrate how Bataille's thought provides new insights into the
development and dynamics of late warfare. In particular, Bataille's
understanding of war and excess expands these critiques in two ways.
First, unlike existing literature, his theories rely less on the notion
that a separate governing ideology recently changed the nature of armed
conflict and, instead, focus on the reasons why the concepts of
risklessness and precision become attractive principles of modern
warfare in the first place. Second[, Bataille reframes debates about
precision warfare by interpreting them as symptoms of a larger
problematic about excess, contingency, and sovereignty]{.underline}. To
help illustrate these points, this section briefly evaluates the case of
the 'accident' as a pivotal notion in the legitimation of injury and
death in contemporary precision warfare. 'Accident' is a relatively
recent term in political discourse. It emerged in the context of
industrial development as a means of managing conflict between
corporations and their workers. Specifically, t[he accident introduced a
space of 'agentless action']{.underline}, such as a machine malfunction,
that allowed corporations to dispute their responsibility for exposing
workers to injury (Cooter and Luckin, 1997; Perrow, 1999). This legal
application of the category was transplanted from engineering
scholarship, where the concept of the accident was developed in order to
explain how a contingent occurrence could take place within an otherwise
stable system without appealing to transcendent or theological
principles (Siegel, 2014: 1--12). In the context of engineering, the
history of machine design was partly inspired by the effort to resolve
particular accidents, but[, in a socio-legal context, the accident
birthed the possibility of an event without responsibility, without
conditions]{.underline} (Siegel, 2014: 15--21). [With the rise of
industrial warfare, accidents became a part of the discourse of armed
conflict]{.underline}. [In i]{.underline}nternational
[r]{.underline}elations literatures, this is perhaps most apparent in
the case of accidental nuclear launch given the potential for nuclear
use to cause planetary destruction (Sagan, 1995). However, the accident
reappeared as a problem with the rise of precision warfare because of
the explicit emphasis on exactness, the reduction of war's lethality,
and the deliberate, even careful, character of war. In short, [[the
ability to govern war]{.underline}]{.mark} precisely [[existed in
tension with the probability of]{.underline}]{.mark} socalled
[[accidental deaths]{.mark}. Precision warfare was]{.underline}, by its
nature, [supposed to be]{.underline}come [accident free]{.underline}.
Patricia Owens (2003) and Maja Zehfuss (2011) have both offered
excellent analyses of the dangerous character of this logic. As Owens
(2003: 599--600) opines, 'at issue \[in this form of warfare\] is how
civilian deaths are legitimated and under what guises this occurs'.
According to Owens, the accident functions as a way of explicating and
extending martial power and, more specifically, of discursively
producing an event as accidental: 'the events labelled "accidents" were
not accidents until they had been narrated as such, contrary to the
liberal state (and positivist) assumption that they must self-evidently
be accidents' (Owens, 2003: 616). Owens and Zehfuss explain how the
category of the accident enables advocates of precision warfare to deny
any relationship between supposed precise technologies and their
capacity to injure and kill. In this way, Owens and Zehfuss also confirm
the broader observation of Paul Virilio (2006) that [the accident
constitutes an integral part of any technology]{.underline} (martial or
not). According to this model, **[[the birth of a technology is also the
birth of the accident]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and, consequently, any
perspective that treats the accident as derivative is engaging in a
depoliticization of the dangers of technology and speed. This process of
depoliticization guts the possibility of democratic politics in
discussions of security and war (Glezos, 2013). Bataille's writings on
war illuminate several additional elements of accidents and
risk-transfer war. First, critical security studies literature chiefly
approaches the accident through the lens of ideology, discourse, and
narration. Here, the accident functions as a kind of discursive trick
that separates legitimate and illegitimate violence and, therefore,
legitimate and illegitimate modes of warfare. This point is an important
rejoinder to the rhetoric of risk-transfer warfare. However, Bataille's
theories focus less on discursive or epistemological claims about the
accident and more on its ontological status. As the previous section
outlined, Bataille views [warfare as a mode of expenditure that emerges
from conditions of excess]{.underline}. For Bataille (1985), excesses
emerge from a type of 'base matter' that is not subject to
representation and can only be testified to through inner experience.
[This form of excess, which cannot be fully sensed or described,
is]{.underline} thus [ontologically contingent]{.underline} and cannot
be known in advance. Put differently, for Bataille, **[[contingencies
are a constitutive part of armed conflict]{.mark} regardless
of]{.underline}** the terminology or **[discourse]{.underline}** that
surrounds them. [Industrial warfare]{.underline} sought to eliminate
these contingencies in order to function according to a model of
rational accumulation. The recent rise of precision, risk, and the
accident as frames for understanding contingency [occurs as part of this
much larger paradigmatic shift to reframe war as a problem of utility,
rationality, and ends]{.underline}. [[The accident constitutes]{.mark}
only [the newest method not just of legitimizing war but also of]{.mark}
governing and [eliminating the problem of excess]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Since [warfare]{.underline} involves expenditures of excess, it [is
necessarily rife with contingencies and accidents]{.underline}. The
accident thus operates as a liminal event in modern armed conflict, both
as an epistemological invention to legitimate specific deaths and
injuries, and as the resistance of base matter and solar economy to
human efforts at rationalization and governance. These theoretical
observations make several interventions into debates about precision
warfare. First, Bataille extends existing critiques of risk-transfer
warfare by both situating them as part of a broader shift in modern
warfare and establishing that the very terms of the discourse are
antithetical to the conditions of solar economy. Bataille's thought
shows how [the structure of rationality in riskless war relies on the
accident as a discursive supplement in order to comprehend the
[excesses]{.mark} that [will recur in a condition of solar economy even
when armed conflict is defined by]{.mark} utility, [rationality]{.mark},
and accumulation]{.underline}. The accident is not only an ideological
trick designed to depoliticize, but also an epistemological supplement
that insulates the precision paradigm from its inability to grapple with
excess. This provides an alternative way of interpreting the concern for
the accident since, following Bataille, [precision legitimates modern
warfare by seeking to eliminate the excesses that have continually
reappeared in spite of the broader transformation of war into a rational
exercise]{.underline}. Precision and the language of the accident
constitute only the latest effort to govern the excessive character of
war. Second, this framing also illustrates why accidents often receive
unprecedented attention in the context of modern armed conflict. Indeed,
while critiques such as those of Owens and Zehfuss reveal how the
accident legitimates liberal war, what might be called the affective
dimensions of the accident receives comparatively little scrutiny
(Bataille, 1991a: 203). Here, Bataille's work extends existing critiques
of precision war by shedding light on the formation of subjectivity in
relation to the accident. Recall that, for Bataille, [the experience of
sovereignty develops in response to chance, the anguish of death, and
expenditure without reserve]{.underline}. Bataille further contends
[that human desires are constituted by an ambivalent relationship to
excess, transgression, and sovereign experience. On the one hand, humans
seek to conserve their life against excess and, on the other hand, human
societies emerge out of the excesses of solar economy]{.underline}.
Bataille (1991a: 243) posits that this ambivalence generates an
attachment to the possibility 'always unexpected, \[of being\] relieved
of the heaviness that the world of utility imposes on us, of the tasks
in which the world of objects mires us down'. For Bataille, **[[the
accident]{.underline}]{.mark}**, as a form of contingency, **[[reveals a
potential type of sovereign experience]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The
existence of this possibility helps to alleviate the sorrow and futility
of a world defined by utility. Accidents function according to the model
of the miracle, the unanticipated, the unpredictable, or the impossible,
which nonetheless occurs (Bataille, 1991a: 242). Following Bataille's
reading, the accident produces two reactions to sovereign experience in
modern warfare. On the one hand, the exposure to the anguish of death
incites the need to control, manage, and govern accidents, a process
that has been well documented by critical security studies scholars
(Bousquet, 2018; Campbell, 1998; Rasmussen, 2006). On the other hand is
the possibility that accidents inspire affective attachments and
fascinations as a form of exposure to sovereign experience. Put
differently, [accidents spark a form of excitement -- either in the
midst of warfare or in fantasies of war]{.underline} -- that has
received comparatively little attention. [[The accident becomes a site
of desire because it ensures that warfare remains contingent]{.mark},
implicitly resisting efforts to govern, rationalize, or form, in
Bataille's words, 'dull war'. This perspective provides a model to
explain why the fantasies, imaginaries, and even experiences of martial
accidents remain a point of intrigue, thrill, and draw for modern
subjectivities]{.underline}. Within the accident is the budding
potential of sovereign experience. Accidents thus support two
complementary forms of subjectivity. The first responds to the
inevitability of accident as a means of securitizing and governing
contingency, while the second embraces the accident as a sovereign or
limit-experience that breaks with the overt rationalization of war and
social life. This point has significant implications for resisting or
contesting securitization regimes. In particular, if Bataille's insight
about the lure of sovereign experience is correct, [[then classical
strategies of]{.mark} critique, [delegitimization]{.mark}, and demasking
power relations in precision warfare]{.underline}, and other contexts,
are problematic strategies because they **[[do not confront the
underlying drive to embrace warfare's contingencies]{.mark} as moments
of sovereign experience]{.underline}**. For Bataille, [this
desire]{.underline} for sovereign experience [intensifies the need to
transgress, to explore prohibited zones and probe limits]{.underline}.
Consequently, delegitimizing the accident, **[[emphasizing the
transgressive character of violence]{.underline}]{.mark}** (or other
parallel acts), paradoxically **[[strengthens the affective attachment
to warfare]{.mark} by reinforcing the notion that war holds out the
possibility of sovereign experience]{.underline}**. Contesting security
discourse on these lines would thus do little to engage the frame of the
accident because it does not support new modes of expenditure, but
simply re-emphasizes the transgressive character of specific practices
of securitization and violence. In this way, Bataille's work shows the
limits of existing critical studies of the accident. To illustrate this
point, [claims about accidents involve not only political questions
about the meaning or significance of specific injuries, but also issues
of equipment malfunction, logistical breakdowns, and encounters with
surrounding ecology]{.underline}. Many of these dimensions of the
accident, as sites of excess and contingency, lead to an enormous
proliferation of new aesthetics, fantasies, and forms of securitization
in modern warfare. To briefly examine a single example, a growing
literature assesses the potential for 'birdstrike', collision between
aircraft and birds, as a threat to military readiness and security
(Richardson and West, 2000). In the birdstrike literature, a
multiplicity of different bird species appear as a new type of security
threat because of their possible interference with the mechanical
operation of airplanes or other airlift operations. Birdstrikes are
exceedingly rare events, which number in the dozens despite thousands of
airlift operations since the invention of flight. Nonetheless,
significant attention, monetary investment, major proposals to redesign
airports, and even plans to disrupt the ecological habitats of bird
species have all been framed as questions of security and military
necessity (Heims, 2011; Kitowski, 2011; Zakrajsek and Bissonette, 2005).
Accidents like birdstrikes exist far afield from the typical concern of
critical security analysis, yet the writing on this subject reflects
Bataille's point since this literature treats the threat of the
birdstrike as an event verging on the miraculous. As Bataille argues,
the transformation of war into a practice of accumulation generates new
excesses and expenditures -- in this context, the contingent encounter
between plane and bird. A martial paradigm defined by accumulation and
rationality views these excesses and expenditures (the needless loss of
a plane) as a threat to security. Hence, even statistically infrequent
birdstrikes constitute an interruption of the dynamics of accumulation.
These events attract incredible attention because they involve
contingency and the possibility of sovereign experience and,
accordingly, become the subject of intense, affective investment. The
vivid fear for multiple bird species and the consistent concern for
aircraft malfunction reveal a social imaginary drawn to the potential
for excesses and contingencies no matter the form and no matter how
statistically insignificant. Here, the birds become the object of a
certain kind of martial horror. Bataille predicts exactly this shift at
the level of desire and imaginary and goes so far as to suggest that,
for moderns living under a paradigm of utility, only the 'imagination
has sovereign moments available to it' (Bataille 1991a: 256). Bataille's
work points to these more liminal accidents as key places where excesses
invite speculation about the potential for sovereign experience and, at
the same time, incite new practices of securitization. In this way, the
birds, as a partially aerial ecosystem, become a new source not just of
anguish and threat, but also of sovereign experience, a new target in
the expansion of armed conflict to new ecologies, and a relief from the
onerous character of modern social life. While birdstrikes represents
only a single case, several studies have highlighted the importance of
transgressive and liminal roles in contemporary warfare, such as
crowdfunding as a new mode of martial organization or the insurgent
potential of improvised explosive devices (Grove, 2016, 2019). These
examples also reflect Bataille's insights about how expenditure, excess,
and the possibility of sovereign experience animate and shift practices
of mobilization and violence in contemporary armed conflict. In a
similar way, Bataille shows how the accident (along with other forms of
contingency) is not anathema to risk-transfer warfare, but instead
functions as a supplement, a moment of transgression amidst the overt
rationalization of warfare. Modern discourses on precision rest on a
form of knowledge that precludes Bataille's sovereignty: '[[knowledge is
never sovereign]{.underline}]{.mark}, to be sovereignty would have to
occur in a moment. But the moment remains outside, short of or beyond,
all knowledge. . .. \[I\]n short[**, [we know nothing
about]{.mark}**]{.underline} what ultimately concerns us, [**[what is
supremely important to us]{.underline}**']{.mark} (Bataille, 1991a:
202--203, emphasis in original). [[The paradigms of]{.mark}
risk-transfer warfare]{.underline}, of the minimization of the accident,
[and]{.underline} of [[securitization]{.underline}]{.mark} more
generally are not capable of thoughtfully generating new forms of
expenditure. They [[derive]{.underline}]{.mark}, for Bataille, [[from a
fearful response to]{.underline}]{.mark} finitude and [[solar
economy]{.underline}]{.mark}: 'we try to escape from this elementary
horror, but, in the darkness and dead silence, it maintains the
unpredictable and elusive movement of everything we have not been able
to reduce to the reassuring order, a movement to which we know we shall
later succumb' (Bataille, 1991a: 217), a paradigm that incites not only
risktransfer warfare but arguably the broader pursuit of security. As a
consequence, [[securitized subjectivities seek opportunities for
expenditure in transgressions]{.underline}]{.mark} such as the accident.
**[These desires]{.underline}**, in turn, **[transform the structure of
contemporary warfare.]{.underline}**
