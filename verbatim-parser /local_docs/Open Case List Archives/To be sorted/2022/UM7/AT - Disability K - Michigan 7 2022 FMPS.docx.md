Deliberative Conversational Norms and Complexity of Thinking

[Deliberative democracy is supposed to be,]{.underline} at its core,
[inclusive, consequential and authentic]{.underline} (Dryzek 2009).
While [inclusiveness and consequentiality rely on design
features]{.underline} and are critical [in systemic approaches to
deliberation]{.underline}, [the authentic requirement refers to what
takes place inside the 'black box' of deliberative
conversations]{.underline} (Gerber et al. 2016). It denotes **[the
quality of deliberative exchanges]{.underline}** and **[is contingent on
citizens' actual adherence to, and internalisation of, deliberative
norms in political exchanges]{.underline}** (Rosenberg 2014).

Even though the specifics of the nature of deliberative conversations
are still the subject of debate (Bächtiger et al. 2010), [there is
general agreement on the significance of reasoning and listening
dimensions in deliberation]{.underline} (Black et al. 2010; Mansbridge
et al. 2012; Morrell 2010; Steiner et al. 2004).

[The reasoning dimension specifies how deliberative citizens should
engage with the topic of discussion]{.underline}. Deliberative citizens
are expected to state their claims and be ready to explain and justify
them when asked to by other participants. But [deliberation involves not
only claim-stating but also encountering novel information and facts
about the topic of debate, including fellow citizens' standpoints and
beliefs]{.underline}. Citizens are [expected to carefully weigh and
consider new information, even information and claims that contradict
the own opinions]{.underline}. **[Through this process citizens improve
their understanding of the issue and get new insights into competing
opinions and perspectives.]{.underline}** As a result, citizens'
preferences become updated and well informed, and **[citizens acquire a
greater understanding of the complexity surrounding political issues,
which in turn opens up for balanced and nuanced reasoning on the topic
of debate]{.underline}** (cf. Black et al. 2010; Steenbergen et al.
2003).

The listening dimension involves norms of interpersonal conduct.
Citizens and politicians alike are supposed to engage in deliberative
exchanges in a respectful manner characterised by listening, perspective
taking and empathy (Goodin 2003; Morrell 2010). [Deliberative listening
goes beyond simply hearing the other]{.underline} (for instance, by
being silent when others speak), [as it demands a particular
open-minded, responsive stance in discussions]{.underline} (Dobson
2012). Through listening, [citizens develop a deeper understanding of
others and learn to empathise with their experiences and situations,
which stimulates them to recognise the complexity and
multidimensionality of political and social issues]{.underline} (cf.
Bohman 1996; Dryzek 2016).

Some scholars have already recognised the conceptual correspondence
between deliberative conversational norms (involving reasoning and
listening dimensions) and complexity of thinking in the way both
theories 'attempt to capture the epistemic weight and quality of human
thought and communication' (Wyss et al. 2015: 641; see also Brundidge et
al. 2014). [When deliberative citizens constructively deal with the
uncertain, tentative and contingent nature of political communication,
**without reverting to dogmatic, closed-minded and prejudicial
thinking**]{.underline} (reasoning), [while continuously listening and
being responsive to others]{.underline} (listening), **[they demonstrate
complexity of thinking]{.underline}** (Wyss et al. 2015). Thus,
complexity of thinking is here claimed to be an underlying component in
both reasoning and listening performances in deliberation.

**[The conceptual correspondence between the deliberative norms and
complexity of thinking is relevant to deliberative scholars as the
construct of complexity can be used to inform how to conceptualise and
operationalise deliberative norms]{.underline}** in a way that makes it
empirically observable and measurable on an individual level of
analysis.

Below, I present a more detailed description of the method of
integrative complexity, which is a validated measurement of individuals'
complexity of thinking. This is followed by a discussion that seeks to
establish why the IC approach is particularly promising when it comes to
conceptualising and measuring deliberative quality.

Integrative Complexity Scale

Overall, the psychological construct of complexity of thinking draws on
a cognitive theory of individuals' (verbalised) information processing,
reasoning skills and decision-making. Broadly defined, complexity of
thinking is a cognitive style associated with 'flexibility, high levels
of information search, and tolerance of ambiguity, uncertainty, and lack
of closure' (Suedfeld 2010: 1670). There are various theories and
instruments available to assess complexity of thinking, and the one
preferred in this context is the theory of integrative complexity (IC).

IC assesses the constitution of individuals' thought processes and
belief systems, especially when dealing with information containing
inconsistent, competing views. The IC measure is used to reflect two
major components of cognition: differentiation and integration. These
dimensions are building blocks, which means that differentiation must be
in place before integration can emerge. Differentiation denotes the
ability to recognise more than one legitimate point of view and/or
relevant dimension of the topic of debate. Integration refers to the
ability to identify and make sense of conceptual links, trade-offs and
similarities among perspectives, and the ability to reconcile or
incorporate the information within a higher-level system (Suedfeld et
al. 2011).

A critical feature of IC is that it is intended to capture the
underlying conceptual structure of positions rather than the actual
content of statements. This means that the construct is valid neutral
and 'the coding system does not rest on assumptions concerning the
logical, pragmatic or ethical superiority of any particular school of
thought' (Baker-Brown et al. 1992: 402-403). Another key feature of the
IC is that it explicitly accounts for integration and not only
differentiation, which is not the case with all measurements of
complexity (Conway et al. 2014).

Another benefit of IC is that it encompasses a relatively broad
understanding of complexity, recognising both its dialectic and
elaborative forms (Conway et al. 2014). Dialectic complexity refers to a
willingness to consider multiple views. Elaborative complexity
recognises 'several complex arguments in defense of a particular
perspective', involving elaboration of a specific viewpoint without
additional information input (Conway et al. 2014: 605).1

Low integrative complexity is associated with salience of a single
dimension or aspect of an issue in reasoning, and with a greater
tendency towards stereotyping, prejudice, dogmatism, and
closed-mindedness (Suedfeld 2010). High complexity, in contrast,
connotes reasoning that adducts multiple perspectives, supported by the
activation of higher-level principles that provide a normative structure
to complex issues (Suedfeld 2010). It is associated with balanced and
comprehensive evaluation of available information, reducing the risk of
biases in promoting better judgment and decision outcomes (Gruenfeld and
Hollingshead 1993).

In sum, IC measures individuals' receptiveness to new information and
alternative perspectives and the ability to incorporate these into their
own reasoning. Given that the same type of cognitive processes are
demanded of deliberative citizens, increases in citizens scores of
complexity of thinking as a result of deliberation can serve as an
indicator of deliberative norm compliance. It would be oversimplifying
to try to connect the deliberative dimensions to either one of the two
aspects of complexity (differentiation and integration) by saying, for
instance, that reasoning corresponds to differentiation of perspectives
or vice versa. What is assumed, however, is that high complexity
involves both reasoning and listening dimensions. As such, IC can be
used to draw inferences about citizens' compliance with the listening
and reasoning demands of deliberation (cf. Brundidge et al. 2014; Wyss
et al. 2015) and thereby inferences can be made about the deliberative
quality of political discussions.

Since IC denotes a particular mental stance, adopting IC as a
measurement of deliberative quality also makes sense given recent
suggestions that deliberation refers to a particular deliberative
mindset or stance (Morrell 2010; Owen and Smith 2015). The idea of a
deliberative stance gives increased attention to the listening dimension
in the form of the 'right' kinds of attitudes, affects and cognitions as
key to deliberation (Morrell 2010; Owen and Smith 2015), and there is a
need to identify methods to assess the extent to which citizens
cultivate a deliberative stance in political discussions.

What is more, the IC measure can potentially further the understanding
of the formation of meta-consensus, i.e. the ability to attain
inter-subjective understanding and agreement regarding the relevant
issue dimensions irrespective of actual disagreement on preferred
outcomes (Dryzek and Niemeyer 2006), which is claimed to be the outcome
of successful deliberative conversations.

Next, I demonstrate how IC as a psychological construct contributes
important insights regarding the question of how to cultivate
deliberative norm compliance in political discussions.

Cultivating Deliberative Norms (and Complexity of Thinking)

Understanding what factors affect the cultivation of deliberative norm
compliance in formal deliberative settings is vital as deliberative
processes can be 'seen as more or less deliberative depending on how
deliberative norms are put into practice' (Black et al. 2010: 325).
[Deliberation is commonly used as a vehicle for citizens to acquire
basic political skills, to learn about political issues]{.underline}
(Gastil 2004) [and to develop reasoning abilities]{.underline}
(Rosenberg 2014). **[This 'transformative' dimension is realised through
citizens' active engagement in conversations when they develop a
distinctly deliberative way of reasoning about politics]{.underline}**
(Warren 1992), which I equate with improved complexity of reasoning.
However, **[developing these capacities is far from
automatic]{.underline}**. [It requires careful attendance to social,
psychological and contextual factors]{.underline} thereby creating a
supportive environment for the emergence of complex thinking.

Contextual Factors

A standardised feature of deliberative design that addresses these
dynamics involves the use of facilitators to stimulate and encourage
citizens to adopt a deliberative style of reasoning (Burkhalter et al.
2002). Most commonly, facilitators are given the prominent role of
introducing participants to the deliberative norms at the beginning of
processes (often by reading out loud rules of the discussion) and
guiding participants throughout the interactions (e.g. Grönlund et al.
2010). In this way, facilitators take deliberative norms into practice
and function as rule-setters and rule-keepers, 'a kind of
personification of discourse rules, whatever these rules are in the
given case' (Landwehr 2014: 77).

Nevertheless, [given the demanding norms of deliberation, it is to be
expected that deliberative processes will vary in effectiveness in
inducing deliberative norms, resulting in greater levels of discordant
dogmatic views and closed-mindedness]{.underline}. Some of this
variation is likely attributable to the style of facilitation, where
[some forms of facilitation might even discourage deliberative
transformation]{.underline} (and hence decrease complexity of thinking).

Styles of facilitation range from active to passive, and they also vary
in terms of the degree to which the focus is on the specific task
performance (reasoning) or on managing relationships (listening)
(Mansbridge et al. 2006). All have particular strengths and weaknesses
with respect to inducing norm compliance. However, evidence suggests
that more active facilitators are preferable (Rosenberg 2014). Unless an
active and balanced facilitation strategy is adopted --recognising the
importance of both reasoning and listening dimensions --deliberation
might give rise to intuitively desirable 'side effects' such as
knowledge gain (Grönlund et al. 2010) or the halo effect of a 'group
hug' (Curato et al. 2013) without necessarily strengthening the
deliberative quality or participants' complexity of thinking.

An active facilitator attending to the reasoning and listening demands
is potentially better placed to help individuals overcome the tendency
to hold on to prior commitments and evoke a sense of security and trust
among participants. The assumption applied to the design of the case
study cited below is that facilitator intervention must be 'clearly
substantial' in order to accomplish the expected transformation of
participants' political reasoning (Rosenberg 2007).

Similarly to [deliberative scholars concern about situational variables,
research on integrative complexity has traditionally been concerned with
contextual factors that affect individuals' tendency to engage in
complex reasoning]{.underline} (Gruenfeld 1995). In particular, IC has
been discussed as an effect of being informed about an issue, the type
of issue being discussed and expectations on participants in
discussions. For example, [studies on complexity have demonstrated that
when subjects have made a prior commitment]{.underline} (by expressing a
view on the topic) [they are less likely to engage in complex
reasoning]{.underline} (Krupnikov et al. 2007).2

Of particular relevance here are [findings demonstrating how integrative
complexity increases when individuals try to solve important problems --
as is ideally the case for deliberation.]{.underline} Alternatively,
[where this 'deliberation' is interrupted **-- if the problem appears
unsolvable**, **if a decision has already been made,** or if there is a
lack of resources to implement a solution -- the situation reaches the
level of 'disruptive stress', and **decreasing integrative complexity is
observed**]{.underline} (Suedfeld et al. 2011).

These findings suggest careful attention to the deliberative context.
Settings that might otherwise be deliberative can reproduce the
aforementioned negative dynamics. [Complex political issues might appear
unsolvable, increasing levels of stress as dialogue pushes against time
pressures and fatigue]{.underline}. Certain conditions might induce
anxiety among citizens, such as when they are asked to remain open to
the unfamiliar, uncomfortable and radically different (Bickford 1996;
Morrell 2010). [To enter into political discussions with a listening,
open and pragmatic stance means that what takes place in the discussion
has the potential to profoundly change, or even undermine, one\'s
existing views, opinions and even identity]{.underline} (Beausoleil
2014). Consequently, there is a constant risk of backlash of
deliberation when participants resort to stereotypical and prejudicial
thinking and established scripts of mind because it 'reduces the burden
of understanding complex social environments' (Lillis and Hayes 2007:
390). **[Reverting to defensiveness, bias and motivated reasoning tends
to induce simplified reasoning for otherwise complex processes and
events to maintain a sense of stability and security]{.underline}**.
Improving IC (thereby cultivating deliberative norm compliance) involves
addressing these challenges, for example by providing enough time for
discussion among participants and the use of experienced facilitators
that can make the process smoother.

### 2AC Disability K -- Political Engagement Good

#### Overly pessimistic frames of disability deconstruction preclude future resistance and weaken political gains achieved by disability activists.

**Jenks 18 -- **PhD candidate in Political Science and International
Relations at the University of Delaware \[Andrew. "Crip theory and the
disabled identity: why disability politics needs impairment." Disability
& Society, Vol 24, Issue 3 (2019). Oct. 31, 2018.\]

Robert McRuer's (2006) [Crip Theory contends that the systemic factors
which enforce compulsory able-bodiedness in society are not just
thoroughly interwoven with compulsory heterosexuality, but these are
mutually contingent upon each other]{.underline}. Crip Theory has taken
the emancipatory message of a disability politics embraced by
cross-disability organizations in the latter half of the twentieth and
early twenty-first centuries and centered that message as one which can
be the basis for examination of the forces which cause the oppression of
marginalized social groups. [Early disability organizing in the United
States was not always done across disability groups and scant resources
necessitated competition amongst some groups]{.underline} (Nielsen
2012). **[A collective disability consciousness does not necessarily
even exist, or exist in the ways in which scholarship purports it
to]{.underline}** (Watson 2002; Engel and Munger 2003; Heyer 2015).
[While I acknowledge and encourage the uncovering of systemic,
biopolitical forces which produce the corporeal able-bodied standard, or
normate, subject, a thorny problem presents itself: **does a coherent
disabled identity or even an identifiable disability identity
exist?**]{.underline} An identity which McRuer relies heavily on in his
presentation of the notion of a 'queer/disabled' subject. Contributions
of Crip Theory and subsequent texts which explore cultural locations of
disability like Alison Kafer's (2013) successful and groundbreaking
Feminist, Queer, Crip rely on this logic to articulate a pan-disability
social identity.

[Political science as a discipline largely ignores
disability]{.underline}. Public opinion polling rarely includes
discussion of people with disabilities. Two examples, an online Harris
Poll from 2015 referencing the passage of the Americans with
Disabilities Act (ADA) and a 1999 Pew Millennium Survey question on the
status of disabled people compared to 50 years ago, both found those
surveyed thought disabled people were better off than in the past (Pew
Research Center 1999; Shannon-Missal 2015). Literature on electoral
participation by Lisa Schur has found disabled people are over time
(since 1998) participating at rates comparable to non-disabled people
(Schur et al. 2002; Schur et al. 2017). **[Political theory has recently
developed a burgeoning interest in disability centered around issues of
care, vulnerability, inclusion and exclusion, and incorporation into
frameworks of capability]{.underline}** (Knight 2014a, 2014b; Clifford
2012, 2014; Simplican 2015; Hirschmann 2012; Arneil 2009). This article
largely deals with literature and debates outside of the purview of
political science but that does not mean its content is not germane to
the politics of disability, and the lives of disabled people.

Perhaps crip theory's most important contribution is its attempt to
address the pluralism which exists amongst the disability community and
highlighting of the shared oppressions which disabled people feel.
[Embracing all perspectives is key to intersectional political movements
where those whose opinions and lived experiences are doubly and triply
marginalized]{.underline} (non-white, straight, articulate, male, etc.,
disabled people) [are actually valued]{.underline}. With this being
acknowledged, **[I fear the academic sub-field of Critical Disability
Studies' over-reliance on social deconstruction of disability and
impairment could have disastrous consequences for disability rights
movements in the future, and a weakening of the political claims and
gains those who are disabled have advocated for and won.]{.underline}**
Throughout this article I am referring to the book by McRuer and the
academic literature which uses a similar post-structuralist articulation
of the identity category. I am not challenging popular culture
articulations of coming out crip or of crip as a social identity.

This article proceeds in three sections. [The first lays out central
components of disability theory as it reflects social movements around
disability rights and subsequent academic theory based on these
articulations including the materialist 'social model' of disability and
the post-structuralist 'crip theory.' The second section presents the
case against extreme 'social deconstruction' of disability. The final
section presents two empirical examples of how crip theory can obfuscate
disability politics. One is the highly publicized rape case of a man who
was unable to consent legally to sexual contact. The second case,
broadly conceived, contends that disability visibility is central in the
fight for rights concerning access for people with
disabilities.]{.underline} Concluding thoughts ask the reader to
**[consider disability studies which takes the study of politics
seriously.]{.underline}**

Here I make a note on language choice as well as choosing to disclose my
close personal connection to the subject of this article. '[Disability'
is often used in reference to a social category assigned to people who
are viewed as not possessing desirable traits. This 'disablist'
understanding of disability, that it is a social trait that one does not
want to possess, dominates how people think about
disability]{.underline}. Rarely do able-bodied people think of
themselves as only 'temporarily able-bodied,' which we all are (Knight
2014b). [While I often focus on the 'negatives' of being disabled I do
not mean to overshadow the positive, emancipatory politics and embrace
of the disabled identity.]{.underline} I identify as being disabled (I
am legally blind) and not having a strong cross-disability
consciousness. This identity and my participation within and in the
study of the Paralympic movement certainly play a part in my arguments.
Previous work (Deal 2003; Jenks and Jenks 2016) also shows that
[disabled people themselves create hierarchies, and blindness is not
seen as 'desirable' or a condition which is necessarily identifiable as
being particularly disabling]{.underline}. This also influences my
decision to [discuss disability which is 'discernible' rather than
'visible' when the opportunity presents itself.]{.underline} I do not
observe disability like other people do, with their eyes. This
influences how I think and write about disability which is not
discernible to others. I do discuss 'visibility' as a separate concept
in the third section of this article.

#### Progress is possible. Anything else ignores large-scale political change effectuated by radical disability activists.

Crip theory and the obfuscation of disability politics

What are disability politics? How do they relate to my central theses:
**[impairment matters in disability politics and social deconstruction
obfuscates and potentially harms disability politics]{.underline}**?
This section first provides a brief overview of the disability rights
movement and the simultaneous evolution of literature in disability
studies. This is done in order to show how [disability studies
scholarship from the 1980s and 1990s reflects the social movements of
the past and present.]{.underline} The section then moves to McRuer's
book and the intriguing and insightful parallels he draws between the
ways in which disabled and queer (or queer/disabled) bodies have been
created over time. [Based on interpretivist inquiry and recreation of
genealogies of disability, one can learn a great deal about the social
construction of disability and deviancy, as well as practices of control
over those bodies labeled as such.]{.underline}

The disability rights movement in liberal welfare states

[The story of disability politics is often one told about shared
experiences of oppression, marginalization, and a struggle which
cross-cuts impairment groups. **Americans Disabled for Accessible Public
Transit (ADAPT) and other cross-disability organizations like the
American Association of People with Disabilities or the Disability
Rights Education Defense Fund certainly have impacted positive changes
in the broader disability community around questions of accessibility,
accommodation, and anti-discrimination**]{.underline}. Most notably,
members of these groups impacted passage of the Rehabilitation Act of
1973, the ADA of 1990, and the ADA Amendments Act of 2008. Oliver and
Barnes (2012) discuss the rise of a broadly focused, loosely associated
Disabled People's Movement in the 1970s to its height in the 1990s as a
formative era in what can be thought of as the beginning of an era of
'disability politics.' Figure 1 delineates different 'eras' of
understandings and reactions to disability by the state and later by
activists.

Figure 1. Eras of disability from a Global North perspective.

Note: Adopted from Cameron and Valentine (2001).

Historically, disabled people have been objects of pity, shame,
extermination, and reverence (Stiker 1999[). The rise of the modern
nation-state in Europe and North America saw the creation of segregated
spaces for people with any number of impairments -- physical, sensory,
intellectual, developmental, mental health, and so forth.]{.underline}
Often when these individuals did not have families, or their families
could not care for them, they were pushed into institutions to be cared
for by state or church-run institutions (Stiker 1999). [Major shifts
occurred with the rise of the Eugenics movement in the early 1900s,
where states attempted to medicalize impairment and disabled people
became more visible]{.underline} (Siebers 2008; Stiker 1999; Dolmage,
2014). After the Second World War, another shift occurred.
[Rehabilitation became the focus, as disability became less of an
unfortunate malady which affected those who were sick or weak, but a
broader issue where fit, young, men were the ones impaired as a result
of war]{.underline} (Cameron and Valentine 2001). **[Finally, the shift
toward a new era of understanding disability, considered emancipatory by
Disability Studies scholars and activists alike, is termed
'post-medicalization']{.underline}** (Cameron and Valentine 2001;
Neufeldt 2003) This was a time when **[disabled people began to affect
large-scale change in the politics that governed their
bodies]{.underline}**. [Social movements made up of people with
disabilities in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom are
well documented. These movements helped usher in the current wave of
disability politics]{.underline} (Barnartt and Scotch 2001).

The need to define disability has historically been one felt by the
state. Oliver and Barnes (2012, 16) note that the United Kingdom did not
begin to officially use the term 'disabled' to describe some its
citizens until after the Second World War. Throughout much of human
history, disabled people have been treated as objects of pity and
charity, generally pushed to the margins of society (Stiker, 1999). [The
rise of an introduced global capitalist system has since reinforced the
practice of valuing bodies based on how much they can
produce.]{.underline} Thus, bodies rendered sick, ill, or weak have been
considered less meaningful and able to contribute to a productive
society. [Neoliberalism further contributed to the devaluing of the
disabled body, a resurgence of practices from the industrial revolutions
in early industrializing nations like the United States and the United
Kingdom]{.underline} (Hughes, 2012). Neoliberal rationality and
economization of the individual has permeated nearly all facets of human
life, where economic rationality dictates that certain bodies are less
valuable than others (Brown 2015).

**[The late 1960s and early 1970s saw the rise of the independent living
movement in Berkley, California, as disability activists insisted on an
act which protected their civil rights, similar to the social
protections offered under the 1964 Civil Rights Act]{.underline}**
(Barnartt and Scotch 2001). Reactions from members of disabled
communities in the United Kingdom like the Union of the Physically
Impaired Against Segregation (UPIAS) to the forced institutionalization
into group homes of people who used wheelchairs became a focal point for
a new disability politics (Oliver 1986; Oliver and Barnes 2012). **[This
emancipatory politics of disability was an attempt to shift
understandings of disability from a phenomenon residing within the body
of the individual, to one located in the conditions which disable people
in society.]{.underline}** The differentiation between this new
understanding of disability and the government's traditional
understanding of disabled people's issues became a focal point for the
emerging field of disability studies in the 1970s.

The social model of disability

[Widely referenced within disability studies, early articulations of the
social model of disability place emphasis on the notion that disability
itself is not natural, but a social construction based on how impaired
bodies are unable to navigate the world around them]{.underline}
(Oliver, 1983; Wendell 1996). This separation of the bodily impairment
from socially constructed disability is [credited to a political moment
in the 1970s where organizations like the UPIAS opposed their members
being warehoused based on their physical disabilities.]{.underline} This
was a not a new revelation, but **[a major turning point in disability
politics as disabled people worldwide began to oppose the medical model
of disability, which views disability as being some condition of the
individual which must be fixed, eradicated, or lived
with.]{.underline}** Jenks notes:

the medical model emphasizes changing the person to fit the environment,
whereas the social model emphasizes changing the environment to fit the
person ... those fighting for the rights of the disabled argue that
disability is not the main barrier to participation in society for
disabled individuals: society's practices construct the barriers. (2005,
152)

[Disability studies scholars and disability activists point to societal
misconceptions, that have become institutionalized, as being one of the
most important barriers to overcome]{.underline} (Oliver and Barnes
2012; Hughes, 2012; Campbell 2009). Ableism, defined as 'a network of
beliefs, processes and practices that produces a particular kind of self
and body (the corporeal standard) that is projected as perfect,
species-typical and therefore essential and fully human' (Campbell 2009,
4), is pervasive and disability studies literature regularly identifies
and critiques the ways in which it presents itself[. Structures of
ableism work to reinforce, and are reinforced by, the ideal body type
valued by the capitalist state]{.underline}. These neoliberal
materializations of the 'good' corporeal body exist in official
policies, as well as ways of thinking about and knowing what disability
is. [Eugenics, which included the classification as undeserving or of
being less than human because someone was deemed to have 'genetic'
qualities which were undesirable, is a product of, and helped produce,
ableist discourse and thinking.]{.underline} Similar lines can be drawn
for the construct of heteronormativity. McRuer (2006) makes these
connections by way of a Foucauldian, interpretivist perspective on the
disciplining of the body.

#### A social deconstruction of disability fails. It erases difference and forecloses progressive social policy.

Negotiating disability identity: the case against social deconstruction

Law professor Bruce Pardy's (2016) contention that students with
disabilities who are allowed accommodations of extra time by Queen's
University on law school examinations have an unfair advantage caused a
stir. Equating the extra time on an examination to a 'head start' in the
100-m sprint in the Olympics, Pardy (2017) questions the realness of
those students' disabilities. Implicitly, he is arguing that some
impairments are less 'real' than others. Pardy would not, for instance,
suggest that a student who was blind and needed to take examinations
with a school-supplied reader should not be entitled to extra time. So,
what makes a disability real? [Disability politics, as originally
articulated in the 1970s, was based on the premise that disability
itself is a social creation.]{.underline} The issue Pardy is
highlighting here is not about whether a disability is real, but whether
these students have an impairment which is real.

Credited to Mike Oliver (1983) and others, the scholarly work which
produced the social model of disability would be challenged by
sociologists and scholars from other disciplines in the 1990s and those
whose work fits under the umbrella term Critical Disability Studies.
**[Sherry argues that 'Impairments are often surrounded by quite
specific medical and cultural discourses which need to be carefully
analyzed to identify the multiple layers of power in which they are
embedded']{.underline}** (2016, 734--735). The distinction between
impairment, some physical condition of the corporeal self which limits
function, and disability, the inability or difficulty participating in
social, political, and economic life, is thus obfuscated and challenges
the basis for the emancipatory politics of 40 years ago.

[But what is the basis for disability? After all, means testing is still
used in the legal definition of disability in the United
States]{.underline}. The ADA, as amended in 2008, uses the verbiage of
'a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more
major life activities' as the first prong in defining disability. [The
language of impairment is interwoven with the layperson's conception of
disability. The 'medical model of disability,' which the social model
simultaneously opposes and builds off, considers disability as an
individual medical condition.]{.underline} Coinciding with the
professionalization of the medical profession in the early
twentieth-century, western understandings of disability as a condition
of the individual body, impairment served as the basis for labeling
people as disabled. Labeling of a body as impaired meant the individual
was occasionally entitled to social welfare from the state, while
simultaneously acquiring the 'privileges' of their disabled status.
[While the ways in which 'disability' as a concept is socially
constructed, and the labeling of individuals as disabled has often led
to marginalization, interrogation of the social construction of
impairment has created a serious rift in the study of
disability.]{.underline}

An ontology of impairment

[Hughes and Patterson (1997) argue that a phenomenological lens must be
used to deconstruct what has been posited as the form of impairment
which jumps to the forefront of discussion on disability: functional
limitations of the body]{.underline}. As an example, at the individual
level, speech impairments and impediments only present themselves when
one must interact with another individual. The lebenswelt, or
life-world, is embodied (Hughes and Patterson 1997, 604). [Norms of
communication are also, then, embodied. Disabled speech or communication
is something which does not exist independent of social interaction, and
is thus socially constructed]{.underline}. This example challenges the
social model of disability in its postulate that disability can be
separable from impairment because there is not something physically or
observably 'wrong' with an individual who speaks in a way considered
abnormal. This condition is disabling when it presents itself. Speech
impediments as a disability, again, only present themselves in the
context of human social interaction. [What about those impairments that
UPIAS members had where they argued so vociferously for an emancipatory
politics which separated their individual corporealities from the
barriers society constructed around them?]{.underline}

Sherry's (2016) call for not only an examination of the social forces
which produce impairment, but also those which produce diagnoses,
questions the 'realness' of impairment which has been so integral to the
politics of and policies around disability in the latter half of the
twentieth century. The work of Simo Vehmas, a philosopher who is a
self-proclaimed critical realist, has provided a counter to a
deconstructionist trend in much of disability studies scholarship in the
past 20 years. Vehmas has questioned the deconstructionist,
post-structuralist, and interpretivist nature of which much disability
studies scholarship has trended toward[**.** I use the term
'deconstructionist' to differentiate the newer vein of disability
studies scholarship which goes beyond elucidating the social
construction of disability, and labeling it as such, like social model
proponents did. It goes further in deconstructing relations of power and
the construction of terms like access]{.underline} (see Titchkosky
2011), [the creation of ableism]{.underline} (Campbell 2009), [and the
concept of the dis/ability]{.underline} (Goodley, 2014). **[This can be
problematic for the application of these emancipatory statements in
relation to the creation of social policy.]{.underline}**

How can we renegotiate the impairment/disability divide without relying
on materialist distinctions between individual corporealities and the
built environment? **[Or worse, how can we lose progress made by those
who have affected social change by arguing for the social
constructionist view?]{.underline}** Vehmas & Mäkelä (2009) attempt to
theorize impairment using John Searle's work. Distinguishing between
what is epistemologically subjective (this article is an example of
fabulous scholarship submitted to this journal) and epistemically
objective (this is an article submitted to this journal), Vehmas and
Mäkelä reiterate Searle in saying these distinctions are but a matter of
degree. However, the distinction between what is ontologically objective
and ontologically subjective is more germane to this discussion:

In the ontological sense, objective and subjective are predicates of the
entities in the world, types of entities and their mode of existence.
Objective entities exist independently of any perceiver or mental state,
whereas subjective entities are dependent on perceivers and mental
states. So, in the ontological sense, pains are subjective entities
because their existence depends on the subject's experience.

But mountains, for example, are ontologically objective because their
mode of existence is independent of any perceiver: mountains would
remain in the world even if all the humans and other subjects with
senses disappeared from the earth. (Vehmas & Mäkelä, 2009, 46)

They go on to make the distinction between intrinsic and
observer-relational qualities of the realness of things. The example of
a wheelchair is presented by the authors. Wheelchairs as a thing are
epistemically objective, but ontologically subjective, as they are only
'wheelchairs' because of their relational character. So, what does this
have to do with disability and impairment?

Searle distinguishes between two kinds of facts. [Brute facts are
intrinsic. They exist independent of human naming, social construction,
and so forth. They do not require naming for their existence.
Institutional facts are those which must be named.]{.underline} The
'fact' that a couple is married is offered as an example of an
institutional fact (Vehmas & Mäkelä, 2009, 48). The authors use the
example of Down's syndrome to illustrate the ontologically objective, or
brute fact, that someone has an extra chromosome 21. This is not Down's
syndrome in a world of brute facts, but its realness as Down's syndrome
is undoubted. [This brute fact imparts a great deal of meaning on the
life of that person, and the decisions made regarding how they will be
educated or treated socially]{.underline}. The 'brute fact of a body
often determines an individual's institutional life in a way that can be
depicted as brutal' (Vehmas & Mäkelä, 2009, 49). While Vehmas' work has
been criticized for having a 'western-centric gaze' by Soldatic (2013,
753), who focuses on the ways in which disability in the Global South
has been influenced by western concepts, which do not necessarily
reflect disability in non-North states, **[the notion that there is some
kind of ontologically objective impairment challenges current trends in
Critical Disability Studies]{.underline}**. Thus, my comments and this
article should be understood in the context of the United States and not
as an attempt to speak universally to disability politics.

Figure 2 shows where the various models discussed, thus far, fit along a
continuum from a positivist, empiricist approach to an interpretivist,
socially deconstructed approach. This illustration shows how the project
of social deconstruction McRuer engages in is nearly purely
interpretivist and should be recognized as being at an extreme of a
continuum. This purely interpretivist model is favored by 'critical
disability studies' and is focused on elucidating power relationships by
way of socially deconstructing impairment and disability. The focus on
social deconstruction, I argue in the final substantive section of this
article, obfuscates disability politics at best, and at worst harms it.
I will advocate for a return to focusing efforts in disability studies
on educating the public (and public officials) on the utility of the
social construction of disability, as it pertains to issues of
impairment.

Why disability politics needs impairment

[Disabled people, in 2018, both exist and are often in better physical
states relative to a hypothetical universe without medical
intervention]{.underline}. **[They exist in the sense that diseases,
infections, and conditions which would have meant certain death just a
century ago are countered with expert medical care.]{.underline}**
[Backlash toward the medical model of disability was focused on its
efforts to hide disabled people]{.underline}, to warehouse them, strip
them of their rights, and make them less than full citizens because of
their corporeal embodiments. [Practices like these, based on eugenic
principles, still happen]{.underline}. They affect people who are poor,
women, racial and ethnic minorities, queer, indigenous, and members of
other minority groups at horrifyingly disproportionate rates. [People
with disabilities fill our jails and do not receive adequate medical
care.]{.underline} I am not endorsing these practices. **[However, I
want to stress that impairment matters, especially in the context of
disability politics.]{.underline}** In this final substantive section,
**[I raise two recent examples of disability-related action and
activism.]{.underline}** [The first concerns the impacts an extreme
deconstructionist understanding of disability can take in the case of
the scholarly commentary on the Anna Stubblefield rape
tria]{.underline}l. [The debates around this case]{.underline},
especially on a disability studies listserv, **[show the consequences of
an extreme interpretivist understanding of disability and
impairment.]{.underline}** The second is the [recent protests around the
defunding of the Affordable Care Act which depends on visibly impaired
people to frame its political message]{.underline}. I frame this in a
broader history of the visibility of disability in the public sphere,
arguing that **[disability protests and social movements are not
possible without making claims based on impairments.]{.underline}**

Reactions to the Anna Stubblefield case

[Response to the 2015 rape trial of Anna Stubblefield illustrates how
support for a purely social deconstructionist understanding of
disability can raise serious ethical concerns for the lives of people
with disabilities]{.underline}. A well-regarded, white, able-bodied
philosophy professor and advocate for persons with disabilities,
Stubblefield was accused of raping a Black, disabled man, who was also
the brother of one of her former students in a 2015 case. The victim,
John Roe, has multiple disabilities and is unable to speak or use an
assistive device in order to communicate. The defense argued Roe
consented to sex acts with Stubblefield through the use of facilitated
communication. Stubblefield was originally sentenced to 12 years in
prison. This sentence was overturned in 2016 as the judge in the
original case had thrown out expert testimony on whether Roe could have
consented using facilitated communication (Engber 2018).

[Facilitated communication is a controversial practice where people who
are unable to communicate verbally have their hands guided by someone
else in order to type what proponents of the practice say are the words
of the disabled person]{.underline} (Sherry 2016b, 974). Sherry (2016b)
recounts the horrifyingly unapologetic posts on the primary disability
studies listserv in the United States, for the Society for Disability
Studies, where facilitated communication and Stubblefield were defended
unblinkingly. I do not bring this last point up in order to perform any
kind of academic mudslinging. However[, many scholars of disability
suggested the Society for Disability Studies fully support Stubblefield
in this case.]{.underline} The inclusion of this case in this article
was influenced by the unwavering support for someone who has committed
an action which she later admitted was a criminal offense. Stubblefield
has since pleaded guilty, in a retrial of this case, to aggravated
assault in the third degree and was sentenced to four years in prison.
This most likely means she will serve no more jail time (see Engber
2018). While Stubblefield's conviction had been overturned on the
grounds that the judge in the original trial unfairly excluded all
testimony concerned with the validity of facilitated communication, a
much more serious problem exists. It goes beyond the arguments Mintz
(2017) makes in a response in Disability & Society which revolve around
the court not allowing testimony from the victim himself and its
implications for the agency of people with intellectual impairments
collectively. There is no doubt the judge was hasty in their decision to
not allow any evidence of the utility of facilitated communication.
[Expert knowledge often uses terminology which can be extremely
offensive to people with disabilities, especially activists and
scholars. Sherry elaborates:]{.underline}

Disability studies scholars have been on stronger ground when critiquing
the language used in the case. In court documents, John Roe was
described as 'suffering' from cerebral palsy and 'mental retardation,'
with 'the mental capacity of a toddler.' Unfortunately, the language of
the court system is often disablist. Given that the courts need to use
the specific language of the criminal code in their verdicts,
alternative language to the term 'mental retardation' was not possible
in this case, but it would have been possible to use an alternative word
other than 'suffering' to describe the experience of having cerebral
palsy. (Sherry 2016, 978)

As Sherry (2016b) notes, the labeling of disability as 'severe,'
extreme, total, and so forth is highly problematic for disabled people
because experts have done a lot of harm to people with disabilities
historically. Furthermore, in the context of the North American disabled
person's experience, centuries of warehousing, needless experimentation
and torture, and sterilization perpetrated by state officials makes
claims of disability experts questionable in many instances. [Much of
the work critical constructivist disability studies scholarship has done
revolves around breaking down the logic that an individual's capability
for participating in public life is so easily determinable based on
impairment (]{.underline}see Bérubé 2003, 2009). Even the parents of a
disabled person have at times not had the best interests of their child
in mind. Parents do not always protect the rights of their disabled
children, or represent their best interests. For example, the case of
Tracey Latimer, a disabled Canadian girl who was murdered by her father
in the 1990s because he believed it would end her suffering. His
'decision' was found to be popularly supported in a public opinion poll
at the time (Stienstra 2012). In another case, an American court
considered the case of the hysterectomy, hormone therapy, and removal of
breast buds of a small child with developmental disabilities, 'Ashley
X,' in the 1990s in Seattle, Washington. An investigative report
concluded this surgical intervention was in violation of the child's
civil rights and there was no legal right for her parents to have
authorized these procedures (Carlson & Dorfman, 2007). Discussions of
sex and disability that revolve around mental age and ability to consent
are complicated, to say the least. Sherry continues:

Disability studies scholars have convincingly critiqued the notion of
'mental age' and identified its disablist underpinnings (Gill 2015).
These scholars would also undoubtedly be concerned about any conflation
of physical impairment with cognitive capacity. However, to be fair,
there was distinct testimony about communication and cognition during
the trial. John Roe's guardians asserted that he was physically,
intellectually, and legally incapable of consent. (Sherry 2016b, 978;
emphasis added)

**[Sexual assault of people with disabilities is a real, tangible,
political problem.]{.underline}** Like all cases of sexual assault, it
can be assumed that reports of sexual assaults occur at much lower rates
than the assaults themselves (Barger et al. 2009). [Regardless, rates of
sexual assault amongst people, especially women, with intellectual
disabilities are staggeringly high]{.underline} (Sobsey and Doe 1991;
Barger et al. 2009; Davis, 2011). Perpetrators are often relatives or
care workers (Davis, 2011), victims face barriers when reporting crimes
to police (Keilty & Connelly, 2001), and sometimes need to seek help in
being able to articulate their experiences with assault (Hollomotz,
2009). An examination of sexual assault in Taiwan showed reported cases
amongst people with disabilities increasing over time at a rate much
higher than the national average, with cases of intellectual disability
making up more than half of those reported overall (Lin et al., 2009).

[Professional (medical expert/practitioner) literature on the topic of
sexuality and people with intellectual disabilities is often critiqued
for its ableist assumptions concerning the ways in which disabled people
should act.]{.underline} Michael Gill's Already Doing It (2015) tackles
what he calls 'sexual ableism' around subjects who are intellectually
disabled. Major foci include dispelling ableist myths of the asexual
disabled person, documenting the tools of control which have been used
to force birth control and sterilization on people of all ages, and the
'problem-led' approach within a 'service-centric risk-hierarchy' within
which many people with intellectual disabilities interact in the form of
group or community homes (2015, 17--18). Sexual agency is as important
to Gil's story as is the ability for individuals to communicate their
desires to others. Mintz (2017), centering his bodily experiences with
both severe cerebral palsy and sexual assault, advocates for the right
of the victim to be able to communicate, and the normative need for the
justice system in the United States to make this a possibility. As a
response to Sherry (2016b) Mintz cites Nussbaum's (1999) capability
framework's 'freedom of sexual satisfaction and affiliation' as the
reason for stating that justice will not be done until the non-verbal
man at the center of this case is given the opportunity to be heard.
Both Mintz's direct response and Gill's book do not help us navigate the
reality of the situation. The intellectually disabled subjects Gill
studies, and Mintz's own experience as someone with 'severe' cerebral
palsy, have something John Roe lacked according to the court, the
ability to legally consent to sex. I recognize this has serious
implications for the control others have over the agency of a disabled
individual. However, universal application of this work to all disabled
people's experiences is dangerous.

Disability visibility and impairment-based claims for access: not just
identity politics

Just as feminist scholar Cynthia Enloe asks us to think about the
question 'where are the women?,' we must similarly ask 'where are the
disabled people?' De jure examples of 'unsightly beggar ordinances' from
the streets in the early twentieth century hold some answers to where
the disabled are not (Schweik 2009, 9), and de facto exclusion from the
public sphere has existed for centuries. [Discernible impairment makes
people 'unsightly.' While these laws extended to cover many disabled
people, not just the discernibly disabled, social movements over time
have relied on disability visibility to promote social
change.]{.underline}

The PBS film Lives Worth Living (Gilkey and Neudel 2011) captures the
imagery that the disabled people's movement in the United States
capitalized upon to achieve the passage of disability rights
legislation. Claims were not based on a marginalized identity. People
chained themselves to inaccessible buses, held sit-ins at inaccessible
offices established under the 1973 Rehabilitation Act, spent nights in
jail cells that were not equipped for their power chairs, and performed
countless other acts to show lawmakers that social policy needed to
change (Barnartt and Scotch 2001). The image of Jennifer Keelan
struggling to make it to the top steps of the Capitol building in
Washington, DC was captivating. The eight year old who has cerebral
palsy, which affects the functioning of her limbs so that she cannot
walk, moves in a determined manner. She uses every part of her body to
inch upward, including her chin, twisting and flopping and heaving her
small body, with ambulatory off-screen participants providing her sips
of water from a cup. 'I'll take all night if I have to,' she exclaims
(Gilkey and Neudel 2011).

[Historically, some of the most visible disability organizations,
including user-led organizations (like the Autism Self-Advocacy Network)
as opposed to professional-led organizations (like Easter Seals or
Special Olympics), are single-disability or similar-disability
organizations which organize around the shared experience of individuals
who identify as having similar impairments]{.underline}. The National
Federation of the Blind in the United States, for example, does not
advocate for the rights of all disabled people, and neither does the
Canadian National Industries for the Blind in Canada. [Both of these
groups have advocated for provisions solely for the blind in disability
social policy in their respective countries, which oftentimes occurred
many years before inclusion of other groups or still exist as blind-only
policies]{.underline} (Crichton and Jongbloed 1998; Erkulwater 2006).

[While a pan-disability consciousness may exist amongst members, these
organizations function much more like political interest groups which
must fight for their particular members' interests, sometimes in
contradiction to other single-disability organizations.]{.underline}
**[Articulations of crip theory, which presuppose a disabled identity
based on shared feelings of societal oppression, fail to capture this
reality of the landscape of disability interest group politics, which
has existed since the early parts of the twentieth
century]{.underline}** (Nielsen 2012). Watson (2002) notes that having
an impairment becomes part of the everyday experience of the disabled
person. One's notion of their self is not always based on discursive
practice, as Butler (1993) would suggest. **[These kinds of academic
claims of an identity which are not necessarily based on anything other
than discursive practice which set up antagonisms]{.underline}**
(self/other, us/them) **[are often not felt by disabled
people]{.underline}** (Watson 2002; Engel and Munger 2003). In fact,
claiming this identity, even under protection of civil rights law, is
often consciously avoided (Engel and Munger 2003). **[This is how crip
theory bends the empirical reality of the lives of disabled people and
forms it into a neat exploration of the sites of shared
oppression.]{.underline}**

#### Their model over generalizes. Political engagement creates contingent forms of progress based on different embodiment of impairments.

Relations at the University of Delaware \[Andrew. "Crip theory and the

A [study of disability politics that engages with politics]{.underline}?

[A view that acknowledges the material basis of impairments is useful
and, indeed, necessary for individuals with these conditions because
their conditions have a physical grounding that require a physical
response.]{.underline} **[There are cases where people do need the
medical model of impairment; they need facts about the physical
consequences of impairment or any other medical conditions they may have
(though not all impairments are medical conditions in the sense that
they would require medical attention).]{.underline}** In plain English,
[people need tablets, operations, therapies, and other remedies that
should be based on medical facts**. Millions of competing texts,
discourses and representations are not much of a comfort for people who
are in pain**]{.underline}. (Vehmas & Mäkelä, 2009, 53; emphasis added)

The recent [ADAPT protests over attempts to repeal the Affordable Care
Act are not about maintaining disabled identity]{.underline}. **[ADAPT,
a disability rights organization which engages in radical political
action to accomplish its goals, holds annual 'actions' where
demonstrators protest the conditions of disabled people in the United
States, often until members are arrested]{.underline}**. The
organization, with roots in Colorado, was responsible for early
demonstrations against inaccessible public transit and recently made
news headlines after police forcibly removed members from the offices of
US Senators nationwide. Colorado Senator Corey Gardner's office was the
site of one such sit in, where police physically, forcibly removed
people protesting for their medical care (Worthington 2017). [These
messages are not effective simply because police are handcuffing
individuals who are protesting. They are effective because these people
are arrested while using wheelchairs, breathing from ventilators, and
using canes.]{.underline} **[The visibility of impairment in these
situations, where political claims are made because people will die
without the healthcare they currently receive, is central to the
politics of disability.]{.underline}**

In this article I have shown how **[the social deconstructionist nature
of articulations of disability based on crip theory has the potential to
obfuscate disability politics]{.underline}**. [This is not a debate over
semantics, as the lives of people with disabilities are affected by
their impairments]{.underline}. [These impairments and their effects
remain, in many cases, the basis for how law subjugates people with
disabilities and labels them as second-class citizens, allowing for
government and expert control over their bodies.]{.underline} Yet with
both the negative past and current transgressions made upon the lives of
disabled people, there is an important place for impairment. [It allows
people with disabilities to demonstrate to those who are temporarily
able-bodied the ways in which the world must be made more
accessible.]{.underline} **[People need Medicaid to live. That is an
impairment-based claim. Buses need to be accessible, this is an
impairment-based claim.]{.underline}**

**[Disability experience cannot be universalized amongst the general
population, otherwise it becomes trivialized]{.underline}** (McRuer
2006). Similarly, **[the devaluation of impairment has dire consequences
for the political claims of disabled people.]{.underline}** I have
acknowledged my position at the beginning of the article and again want
to touch upon this. Part of why I care about this issue is because
impairment dictates my life. I cannot drive a car. I also cannot serve
in the military. [Part of producing knowledge where the line between
researcher and participant is blurred is that we privilege our own
embodied experiences]{.underline}. I do not make the argument against
extreme social deconstructionist work because it offends or affects me
personally**[. My claims are based on the recognition that the social
model of disability plays an important role in all lives in producing
disability due to discernible corporeal difference]{.underline}**. When
Vehmas and Watson (2014) ask us to consider what is so critical about
critical disability studies**[?, they are expressing genuine concern for
the lack of normativity involved in the social deconstructionist
project]{.underline}**. Whether it revolves around the case of an
intellectually disabled person not consenting to sex, or the need for
disability visibility in framing political demands, disability politics
needs impairment.

Critical disability studies and justice

[The influence of CDS and its challenge to the assumption that
disability is a uniform condition have enabled the emergence of new
ideas on disability]{.underline}. In particular, this has enabled the
development of a theory that can take account of not only impairment
effects but also can include class, ethnicity, sexual orientation or
cultural identities. [It has also argued for the re-emergence of a new
political identity, one where a solidarity that was previously built on
a common single identity is replaced by one that incorporates multiple
voices including representatives from across the range of
constituencies.]{.underline} The politics that it seeks to develop will
be the ending of the single interest group identity of the disability
movement to be replaced by single-issue groups campaigning for different
social issues. **[To paraphrase Lister (1998, 74), if disability and
impairment are simply to be 'deconstructed into a kaleidoscope of
shifting identities' and ableist discourses, there will be no disabled
people left to either fight for the right to be, or to be a
citizen.]{.underline}**

If [**the principles of CDS are evaluated critically in the light of
disadvantage, its analytical and political value becomes questionable**.
Its relativism and its suggestions that impairments are ethically and
politically merely neutral differences are false. Impairments often have
very tangible effects on people's well-being, many of which cannot be
explained away by deconstruction]{.underline} (for example, Shakespeare
2006; Thomas 1999**[). Recognizing impairment effects is necessary in
order to secure proper treatment and social arrangements that enhance
disabled people's well-being and social participation]{.underline}**.
CDS runs the risk of dismissing not only the personal experiences of
living with impairment, but also the significance of the differences
between socially created disadvantages. [These disadvantages that often
result from oppressive social arrangements, are very much real and take
place in different ways for different disadvantaged groups.]{.underline}

[Disabled people typically experience disadvantage in relation to the
market and capitalism, and they have to a large extent been excluded
from employment and from equal social participation, respect and
wealth]{.underline} (Wolff and De-Shalit 2007, 26). On top of these
materialist disadvantages, disabled people are stigmatized as deviant
and undesirable, and also subordinated to various oppressive
hierarchical relations. **[For disabled people to achieve participatory
parity, they require more than recognition; they need material help,
targeted resource enhancement, and personal enhancement]{.underline}**
(Wolff and De-Shalit 2007). [Disability is rooted in the economic
structures of society and demands redistribution of goods and
wealth]{.underline}. In contrast to some other oppressed groups,
**[disabled people require more than the removal of barriers if they are
to achieve social justice.]{.underline}** This extra help might be small
-- for example, allowing a student with dyslexia extra time in an
examination -- through to complex interventions such as facilitated
communication, a job support worker or 24-hour personal assistance.
Whatever the size, it is an extra cost both to employers and to the
state. **[These are real needs and represent real
differences]{.underline}**. [Without an acceptance of these differences
it is hard to see how we could move forward. Whilst these 'real
differences' can be presented as the result of dominant ableist
discourses where disabled people's needs are regarded as extra cost,
this does not solve the problem. **The problems disabled people face
require more than ideological change, and ideological change is of
little use if it does not result in material change.**]{.underline}

[CDS fails to account for the economic basis of disability and offers
only the tools of deconstruction and the abolishment of cultural
hierarchies to eradicate economic injustice.]{.underline} This, as
Fraser (2000) has argued, would be possible in a society where there
were no relatively autonomous markets and the distribution of goods were
regulated through cultural values. In such a society, oppression based
on identity would translate perfectly into economic injustice and
maldistribution. This is far from the current reality where
'[marketization has pervaded all societies to some degree, at least
partially decoupling economic mechanisms of distribution from cultural
patterns of value and prestige']{.underline} (Fraser 2000, 111). Markets
are not controlled by nor are they subsidiary to culture; 'as a result
they generate economic inequalities that are not mere expressions of
identity hierarchies' (Fraser 2000, 111--112). [The disadvantage related
to disability is to a great extent a matter of economic injustice, and
before this injustice can be corrected we have to be able to identify
those individuals and social groups that have been disadvantaged by
social arrangements]{.underline}. Whilst this does create and foster
categories and binaries between groups of people, it also requires some
sort of categories to start with; namely, the various categories of
disadvantage.

**[Both the social and physical mechanisms that produce human diversity
are real, and they produce tangible differences that cannot be
challenged, let alone abolished, merely by pointing out the wanton
nature of difference, and deconstructing the meanings attached to
disability.]{.underline}** [Changing the social conditions that
disadvantage and disable some people demands that the diverse, sometimes
dualistic, reality of social advantage and disadvantage between
different groups of people is recognized]{.underline}. This is exactly
why [group identities based on, for example, impairment, gender, or
sexuality have been invaluable tools in the resistance against
discrimination and oppressio]{.underline}n -- in the fight against
socially produced disadvantage. Confident, **[positive disability
identity has enabled many disabled people to actively challenge the
status quo that disadvantages them and to claim rights and power and
participation in dominant institutions.]{.underline}** Being different
from the so-called normal majority is no longer considered to conflict
with a good life, equality and respect. Quite the opposite, positive
realization of one's difference has been liberating and empowering to
many disabled people (Shakespeare 2006; Morris 1991). [For a radical and
active disability movement to emerge and for disabled people to take
action on their own account, they have to see themselves as an unfairly
marginalized or disadvantaged constituency and a minority
group]{.underline} (Shakespeare and Watson 2001). The category
disabled/non-disabled is a good abstraction that can enable the
development of communities of resistance, and without it is hard to see
how these could develop.

[CDS is premised on the idea that difference acts as a precursor to the
normalizing of behaviour and a requirement to treat people differently
and, importantly, less favourably. **There is, however, no evidence to
suggest that the categories that are applied to disabled people create
an unnecessary divide between disabled and non-disabled
people**]{.underline}. You could equally make the point that wi**[thout
these categories we would not know what it is we have to do, what
actions we have to take or what services we have to put in place to
include disabled people]{.underline}**. Indeed, for many disabled people
the disadvantages they are subjected to arise not as the result of
domination but through neglect and the denial of services and through
society failing to take responsibility for those in need. As Wolff
(2009, 114) points out: ['anti-discrimination policy needs to identify a
group to be protected.']{.underline} In other words, [it is impossible
to fight the oppression of a group of people that does not exist.
**Recognition of impairment is also crucial regarding legislation and
policy that aim to protect disabled people against
discrimination**]{.underline}. [The point of anti-discrimination
legislation is to protect people from discrimination on the basis of
their physical and mental properties, not on their opportunity to
achieve equal participation and respect.]{.underline} Thus, 'the
parallel to race and gender is not disability but impairment' (Wolff
2009, 135).
