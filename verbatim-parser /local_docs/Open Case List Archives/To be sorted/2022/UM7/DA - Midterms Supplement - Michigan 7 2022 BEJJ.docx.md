#### The polls are neck-and-neck -- Democrats are poised to pull ahead now

Kyle **Morris 7/13** \[Morris is a political reporter, 7/13/22, "Shock
Poll: Democrats closing gap with Republicans ahead of midterm
elections,"

A new poll has found that [**Democrats and Republicans are neck and
neck** in the upcoming midterm elections, with Democrats citing gun
violence as their number one concern even as the economy continues to
tumble.]{.underline}

The Siena College Research Institute poll, conducted on behalf of the
New York Times between July 5 and 7 among 849 registered voters, found
[the **race to control Congress is tight, with voters preferring
Democrats** to Republicans by just one percentage point]{.underline},
41%-40%. Nineteen percent of respondents remain undecided.

However, among likely voters, the Times noted that 44% favored
Republicans while 43% expressed support for Democrats in congressional
races.

[While Republicans place significant focus on the economy ahead of the
midterm elections, with 29% labeling it as the \"most important
problem\" facing America today, Democrats who took part in the poll
believe **there are higher priorities**.]{.underline}

[Only 13% of Democrats labeled the economy as the most pressing
crisis]{.underline} in the U.S., compared to the 17% who insisted gun
policies are the most important concern. As for inflation and the cost
of living, 26% of Republicans and 10% of Democrats listed it as the
number one issue.

[The poll also found an overwhelming 77% of those surveyed believe the
nation is headed in the \"wrong direction.\" Among party lines, 89% of
Republicans believe the U.S. is headed in the wrong direction, compared
to 63% of Democrats]{.underline}. Ten percent said they are unsure or do
not have an opinion.

[Of those that took part in the poll, 87% of Republicans stated they are
almost certain or very likely to vote in the November general election,
compared to **90% of Democrats**.]{.underline}

Inflation accelerated more than expected to a new four-decade high in
June as the price of everyday necessities remains painfully high,
exacerbating a financial strain for millions of Americans and worsening
a political crisis for President Biden.

The Labor Department announced Wednesday that the consumer price index,
a broad measure of the price for everyday goods, including gasoline,
groceries and rents, rose 9.1% in June from a year ago --- the highest
inflation recorded in over 40 years. Prices jumped 1.3% in the one-month
period from May. Those figures were both far higher than the 8.8%
headline figure and 1% monthly gain forecast by Refinitiv economists.

#### Trump will cost Republicans the midterms -- his forthcoming presidential run and continuous presence in politics will turn swing states blue

Kelsey **Vlamis 7/24** \[Kelsey is a breaking news reporter for Insider,
7/24/22, "Gov. Larry Hogan said if Trump announces a 2024 run before the
midterms GOP governors worry it will \'cost us seats\',"
<https://www.businessinsider.com/gop-governors-worry-trump-2024-run-cost-them-midterms-hogan-2022-7>\]
//mh

[Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan said he and other Republicans are worried
about how the party\'s **chances in the midterms could be impacted by
former President Donald Trump announcing a 2024 run** before election
day.]{.underline}

\"We had discussions about that at the Republican Governors Association
last week,\" Hogan said during an interview with ABC\'s \"This Week\" on
Sunday.

[\"I think most people are very concerned about **the damage it does to
the party** if he announces now,\" Hogan, who has frequently criticized
Trump, said. \"And it may help in very red states or very red districts.
But in competitive places and purple battlefields, it\'s going to cost
us seats if he were to do that.\"]{.underline}

Trump has not announced whether or not he will run for president in
2024, but [he has **repeatedly teased a run**, telling his supporters
they\'ll be \"very happy\" with his decision.]{.underline} Recent
reports have suggested he could announce as early as September. [But
some in the GOP, including his allies, worry **it could derail the
party\'s midterms messaging,** which has largely consisted of attacks
against President Joe Biden and a focus on high inflation and gas
prices.]{.underline}

Hogan pointed to prior losses for Republicans that occurred under Trump:
\"[Trump already lost us the White House, the Senate, the House, now
**he\'s costing us governor seats and Senate seats**.\"]{.underline}

He also said he was \"50/50\" on whether or not Trump would actually run
again.

\"His ego probably can\'t take another loss. After all, he lost to Joe
Biden, which is hard to do. But he likes to be the center of
attention,\" he said.

Hogan, a GOP governor in a blue state, could not run for reelection this
fall due to term limits in Maryland. The candidate he endorsed, moderate
Republican Kelly Schultz. was defeated in the primary by Trump-endorsed
Dan Cox. Hogan said Sunday he thinks there\'s no chance Cox can win.

#### Dems gaining momentum with women -- they're key

Kaitlin **Lewis**, **7-18**-2022, \"As midterm fears mount, Democrats
seek to rally on women\'s issues to win,\" Newsweek,
[https://www.newsweek.com/midterm-fears-mount-democrats-seek-rally-womens-issues-win-1725717

Hours after the Supreme Court overturned the federal protection for
abortion in June, President Joe Biden addressed the nation with a clear
statement: \"[**[Roe is on the ballot]{.mark}** this
November]{.underline}.\" That message [has been [a focus point for the
Democratic Party]{.mark}]{.underline} heading into midterm elections at
a time when Biden faces historically-low approval ratings, even among
supporters, sinking to 36% in July according to a poll conducted by
CNBC. But in the wake of overturning Roe, the issues of
[[abortion]{.mark} access and women\'s health have been pushed to the
**[top of voters\' issue lists,]{.mark}** [offering
**Dem**]{.mark}**ocrat[s]{.mark} [a ray of hope]{.mark}**]{.underline}
for beating their Republican opponents in key state elections in
November. A poll conducted by the The Associated Press and the NORC
Center for Public Affairs Research at the University of Chicago
(AP-NORC) in the days following the Dobbs vs. Jackson case, in which the
Court ended the federal protection for abortion, found that
**[[22%]{.underline}]{.mark}** of voters [[label abortion]{.mark} or
women\'s rights as [a top-priority issue]{.mark}]{.underline} for this
year\'s election, nearly triple the percentage the same study found in
December 2021. And a report from the Kaiser Family Foundation on June 9,
a few weeks before the decision was handed down, found that 25% of women
voters ages 18 to 49 say they would be motivated this fall to only
support a candidate who wants to protect access to abortion. One expert
told Newsweek there is a simple formula for gender politics in an
election year. \"In general, the strategy for Democrats in a tight year
is: **[[win women by more than you lose men]{.mark} by]{.underline}**,\"
said Celinda Lake, a leading political strategist in the DNC. According
to the Center for American Women and Politics (CAWP),
**[[women]{.underline}]{.mark}** voters have **[[turned out in higher
numbers than men]{.underline}]{.mark}** since the 1980s, including in
midterm elections, and are more likely to vote for Democratic
candidates. In 2020, women outvoted men 68.4% to 65%. But even with an
increased focus on women\'s health, abortion access still falls behind
other voter issues approaching the midterms. A New York Times/Siena
College poll conducted in early July found that abortion and women\'s
rights were listed as the sixth-highest problem facing the country
today, trailing the economy, inflation and gun policies. However, Lake
told Newsweek that women voters could still prove to be valuable for the
DNC, given that **[[inflation]{.underline}]{.mark}** typically impacts
their market baskets differently than men. For example, [women are more
likely to look for support this fall for the rising cost of healthcare,
groceries and education -- [issues]{.mark} on which [voters]{.mark}
typically [trust]{.mark} [Dem]{.mark}ocrat[s]{.mark} [more]{.mark} than
Republicans]{.underline}. \"Men think it\'s a good day when the
government hasn\'t done anything bad to you,\" Lake said. \"Women think
that they and their families might need a safety net program at some
time. Many men think, \'I can handle that on my own; I can take care of
my family.\'\" \"[That\'s the area of tackling inflation [where
Dem]{.mark}ocrat[s have the biggest advantage]{.mark}]{.underline},\"
Lake added.

#### Trump's gains don't apply to the Senate races.

Rodrigo **Dominguez**-Villegas **7-18** Director of Research at UCLA
Latino Policy and Politics Initiative, "Latino voters will play pivotal
role in 2022 U.S. Senate races", UCLA Newsroom,
[https://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/latino-voters-and-2022-midterms
//](https://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/latino-voters-and-2022-midterms%20//)

Republican inroads with Latino voters: A larger trend? The authors'
analysis shows that Democratic candidates for the Senate outperformed
Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden with Latino voters in 2020
in four of the five states analyzed, excluding Texas. Georgia's hotly
contested 2021 Senate runoff elections saw the largest gap, with
Democratic Senate candidates outpacing Biden among Latinos by more than
10 percentage points. The report also shows that in Arizona, Colorado
and New Mexico, between 2% and 3% of Latinos voted for Donald Trump
while voting for the Democratic Senate candidate. Overall,
[**[Trump]{.mark} [improved]{.mark}** his margin with Latino
voters]{.underline} between the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections,
**[[but]{.underline}]{.mark}** the data show **[[no evidence of a
generalized drop in Latino backing for Dem]{.mark}ocratic
candidate[s]{.mark}]{.underline}** in 2020. The authors noted that
**[[Trump's]{.mark} biggest [gains were limited
regionally]{.mark}]{.underline}** to areas of Florida and Texas and
emphasized the current report's findings of **[[strong support among
Latinos for Dem]{.mark}ocratic [Senate
candidates.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Still, Latino swing voters could be a
decisive factor in some close Senate races, they noted, particularly
with the continued rapid growth of the Latino electorate. Between 2016
and 2020, the number of Latino voters who cast ballots increased by
almost 31%, nearly double the nationwide 15.9% growth in ballots cast
between those four years, said Rodrigo Dominguez-Villegas, the
institute's research director and one of the report's authors. "Our
research continues to show the growing power of Latino voters,"
Dominguez-Villegas said. "With a million Latinos coming of voting age
every year, the Latino electorate will play a pivotal role in the 2022
midterms and beyond."

## GOP Good DA

### 1NC -- UQ -- General

#### GOP wins now -- momentum

Blake **Hounshell 7/19** \[Hounshell is the editor of the NYT On
Politics newsletter and a writer for the NYT, 7/19/22, "The Midterm
Races That Give Democrats Nightmares,"
<https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/19/us/politics/secretary-of-state-races-trump.html>\]
//mh

[Professional Democrats have many **fears about the 2022 midterm
elections** that keep them up at night.]{.underline}

Chief among them: losing Congress and handing over investigative powers
and the ability to set the Washington agenda to Kevin McCarthy and Mitch
McConnell. Granting Republicans full control over states where abortion
remains contested. Seeing President Biden turned prematurely into a lame
duck.

[Somewhere near the top of that list is the concern that **voters will
elect Donald Trump's preferred candidates** to the office of secretary
of state, a job that in many states plays a critical role in
safeguarding the right to vote, while also ensuring the smooth operation
and fairness of the electoral system.]{.underline}

To put it plainly, the widespread worry on the left is that [**Trump's
loyalists will guarantee his re-election** in 2024 if they take power in
2022. It's not something either Trump or these candidates labor
especially hard to rebut.]{.underline}

Secretary of state is not a glamorous gig, generally speaking; it's
primarily an administrative job, and tends to attract little attention
from the public and press. That changed significantly in battleground
states after the Trump-fueled election chaos in 2020, and now money and
attention are pouring into secretary of state races --- not least
because the former president has made it his mission to elect Republican
candidates who back his conspiracy theories.

[It's easy to tell what Trump wants: total fealty. It's often far harder
to figure out what voters want.]{.underline}

Enter a new poll of five swing states --- Arizona, Georgia, Michigan,
Minnesota and Nevada --- that was shared with The New York Times in
advance of its publication. The survey, which polled 1,400 people who
are likely to vote in November, was conducted by David Binder Research
on behalf of iVote, a group that backs Democrats in secretary of state
races.

Interpreting the findings, which focus not on candidates but on voters'
views about what they think is important in a secretary of state, is a
tricky business.

[The poll found that 82 percent of likely voters rated "accurately
tabulating votes in elections and certifying results" as an extremely
important responsibility. Additionally, 67 percent said they would be
much more likely to support a candidate "who will prioritize options for
all voters and making sure every vote is counted."]{.underline}

But as is often the case with voters, they are giving us conflicting
signals. Fifty-nine percent said they would be much more likely to
support a candidate "who says the top priority is to ensure fair
elections and make sure that only eligible voters are casting ballots."
That sounds a lot more like what many Republican candidates are saying.

[In one indication of just how much traction Trump's claims still hold
over the G.O.P. base, **72 percent of voters who picked Trump in 2020
said the election had been stolen from him. That's about a third of all
voters**.]{.underline}

Key Themes From the 2022 Midterm Elections So Far

The state of the midterms. We are now over halfway through this year's
midterm primary season, and some key ideas and questions have begun to
emerge from the results. Here's a look at what we've learned so far:

A surprisingly tight race. Despite President Biden's low approval
ratings, Democrats are roughly tied with Republicans among voters ahead
of the midterm elections. According to a New York Times/Siena College
poll, 41 percent of registered voters said they preferred Democrats to
control Congress compared with 40 percent who preferred Republicans.

Trump's waning influence? While former President Donald J. Trump's
endorsements have helped propel some candidates to primary victories,
he's also had notable defeats. The losses have emboldened Mr. Trump's
rivals, who see an opening for a post-Trump candidate in 2024, and a
recent poll found that half of G.O.P. voters are ready to leave Mr.
Trump behind.

Democrats' risky bet. As Democratic leaders warn loudly of right-wing
threats to democracy, their campaign arms have been attempting to
influence Republicans primaries in hopes of elevating far-right
candidates that they believe will be easier to beat in the fall. The
governor's race in Illinois is the most expensive example yet of this
high-risk strategy.

[**Election deniers rise**. Republican voters have nominated several
candidates who have spread falsehoods about the 2020 election and sowed
distrust in American democracy, and who are now vying for offices that
will hold significant sway over the 2024 presidential election.
B]{.underline}ut in places like Colorado, election denialism has its
limits.

### 2NC -- UQ -- Smear Campaign

#### A smear campaign against Democrats guarantees a Republican win 

Jon **Raasch 7/20** \[Raasch is a journalist and producer for Fox News,
7/20/22, "Midterms because of these key issues, GOP Leader McCarthy
says,"
<https://news.yahoo.com/republicans-back-house-midterms-because-153854797.html>\]
//mh

[Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy said **his party will retake the
House** this fall because of their stance on inflation, immigration and
other key issues that he shared exclusively with Fox News
Digital.]{.underline}

[\"The **Democrats have failed** the American public,\"]{.underline}
McCarthy said. \"I think the extremism on the Democratic side has pushed
people away.\"

[Roughly 1.7 million **Americans have changed their party affiliation**
over the past 12 months, and more than one million U.S. voters have
switched their party affiliation to the GOP]{.underline}, according to
an analysis from the Associated Press. Two-thirds of those have gone to
the GOP, while just 630,000 have switched to the Democratic Party,
according to the report.

McCarthy said [voters \"**want to see a party that puts people before
politics**, and that\'s exactly what the Republican Party is
doing.\"]{.underline}

[McCarthy added that the Democrats\' approach to key issues such as
inflation, energy independence, immigration and crime has
failed.]{.underline}

[\"With the highest inflation we\'ve had in more than 40 years ... gas
prices that you have never seen like this before, crime in our streets
and a border that\'s wide open that now has fentanyl to be the number
one killer of Americans between the ages of 18 and 45,\" McCarthy said.
\"If we take the majority, we will make sure we lower the cost of energy
and become energy independent, we secure our streets to be safe and
then, more importantly, we secure our border at the same
time.\"]{.underline}

Highlighting the success of the Republican\'s agenda, McCarthy
referenced Myra Flores, who recently won in a Texas special election in
a historically Democrat-held seat.

\"Congresswoman Myra Flores, who\'s never run for office before, she
proved she could do it based upon securing our border, based upon making
America energy independent, so your gasoline price gets lower, we lower
inflation, parents have a say in their kid\'s education, the streets
become safe again with that type of idea that we can win in a seat like
that, I think we can have a really, really big red wave,\" McCarthy told
Fox News.

### 2NC -- UQ Doesn't Overwhelm

#### The midterms are a wash for Democrats -- Biden's failures guarantee a loss

Charlie **Cook 7/21** \[Cook is an American political analyst who
specializes in election forecasts and political trends, 7/21/22, "What
Could Save Democrats From a Midterm Catastrophe?,"
<https://www.cookpolitical.com/analysis/national/national-politics/what-could-save-democrats-midterm-catastrophe>\]
//mh

At a time when very little if anything is "normal" about American
politics, we have come to expect the unexpected. [While the House looks
very, **very likely to flip into Republican hands** and the Senate more
likely than not]{.underline}, what kind of event might keep at least one
if not both chambers in Democratic control?

[Democrats fervently hope that the reversal of Roe v. Wade, gun
legislation, and the findings of the Jan. 6 committee (or some
combination thereof) might galvanize their voters enough to retain at
least one chamber. But data suggests that **even a combination of all
three is unlikely to be the antidote for their problems.**]{.underline}

[The public is exhibiting an **incredibly high level of pessimism**
about the direction of the country thanks in part to a variety of
economic indicators that are all flashing red. Inflation is running at
its highest rate in more than 40 years]{.underline}, the National
Association of Realtors reported in May that the ability of buyers to
afford a home hit its lowest levels since 2006, and over half of
Americans and a majority of economists are bracing for a recession in
the next year or 18 months.

[With those factors, along with the **inability of President Biden and
congressional Democrats to even remotely deliver on all they promised**,
there is plenty to be pessimistic about for Democrats. Midterm elections
are basically report cards halfway through a president's term, an
opportunity for voters to choose between "stay the course" or "time for
a change."]{.underline} History shows their proclivity is to opt for a
midcourse correction, if not a total reversal of what happened two years
earlier. Setbacks from bad elections have enormous consequences. The
composition of the U.S. Supreme Court is a prime example of that, but
there are other potentially grave consequences---more on that later.

### 2NC -- Latino Voters

#### Republicans winning Latino voters now

//gbs

WASHINGTON (AP) --- Just 46 residents of Starr County, Texas, cast
ballots in the state's Republican primary two years ago. But last week,
nearly 1,100 Republicans voted in the sparsely populated county that
hugs the Mexican border. A similar [**[surge in Republican
turnout]{.mark}** unfolded [across **South Texas**]{.mark}, a longtime
Democratic stronghold dominated by Latino voters.]{.underline} In five
U.S.-Mexico border counties, nearly 30,000 people voted in the GOP
primary, an [[**increase** of more than 25%]{.mark} in participation
**[from 2020]{.mark}**. The Texas primary]{.underline}, which ushered in
the 2022 midterms, is emerging as [an **[urgent warning for
Dem]{.mark}**ocrat**[s]{.mark}** who are clinging to narrow majorities
in Congress. The **[drift of Latino support]{.mark} toward Republicans**
that surfaced while]{.underline} former President Donald [Trump was in
office may prove to be **[a]{.mark} more [enduring political
trend]{.mark}** that could force Democrats to reassess how they win
elections]{.underline}. The reverberations are being felt far beyond
Texas. In **[[South Florida]{.underline}]{.mark}**, where Democrats were
caught off guard by losing two House seats in 2020 that they'd flipped
the previous cycle, some say the party must intensify on-the-ground
operations that were largely suspended during the pandemic. Perhaps more
fundamentally, they say, Democrats must do more to listen to the
priorities of Latino voters and make fewer assumptions about their
support. "It plays to this elitist branding that the Democratic Party is
trying so hard to shake," said Devon Murphy-Anderson, the Florida
Democratic Party's former finance director. "You can't do that when
you're pointing the finger at somebody and saying, 'We know what's best
for you, and it's our candidate.'" Murphy-Anderson, is co-founder of Mi
Vecino, a Florida Democratic advocacy group that plans to spend at least
\$2.3 million in the midterm cycle and register a minimum of 30,000 new
voters in heavily Hispanic areas. Overall, Latinos still support
Democrats by wide margins. [Biden carried them]{.underline} in 2020, 59%
to 38%, [but that was 17 percentage points lower than]{.underline}
Hillary Clinton's [2016]{.underline} margin, according to Pew Research
Center data. Kellyanne Conway, a Trump adviser and his 2016 campaign
manager, said she presented data on GOP inroads with Hispanic voters
during last weekend's Republican National Committee retreat. "The left
just sees them as immigration voters," Conway said of Hispanic voters.
By contrast, she said, Trump has helped Republicans win over Hispanics
on issues including job creation, education and traditional religious
beliefs: "We connected with them intellectually, economically and
spiritually." Abel Prado, executive director of the Democratic advocacy
group Cambio Texas in the Rio Grande Valley, acknowledged that
Republicans have intensified candidate recruitment efforts that may have
contributed to small gains in primary participation. But "when you look
at the raw votes, we're still outvoting them 3-to-1." Prado also said
Republican efforts could backfire, ultimately energizing local
Democrats. "Hopefully the bad headlines do encourage candidates to
invest way more heavily in the Rio Grande Valley," he said. "Republicans
are throwing money at the Valley without any remorse. You don't see the
same thing from Democrats." Mayra Flores, who won the Republican
nomination for an open South Texas congressional seat last week, said
former president Donald [**[Trump]{.mark}** "played a huge role" in
**[energizing Latinos]{.mark}**]{.underline} in part [by labeling
Democrats as socialists]{.underline}. Still, she said the party's gains
aren't dependent on him being on the ballot --- as last week's turnout
shows. She said she personally connected with voters. "They're finally
seeing a Republican that looks like them, that has a similar story to
them and shares their values," Flores, who was born in Mexico and
immigrated to the U.S. at age 6, said of voters in her district, which
includes the border city of Brownsville. "I think that's very
important." Improving Republican primary turnout in GOP primaries could
buck decades of Democratic suggestions that Texas' booming Hispanic
population would eventually flip America's largest Republican state. A
ballooning Hispanic community, after all, helped transform once
GOP-leaning California into the nation's biggest blue state in the
1990s. Flores voted for Barack Obama in 2008, but later became a
Republican, after becoming more politically engaged and deciding that
the party better represented her community's traditional family and
religious values. She later worked as a Hispanic organizer for Trump's
2020 campaign, trying to woo voters who had long voted Democratic more
out of habit than political conviction. "Unfortunately, most of the
people did not know who they were voting for," Flores said of longtime
South Texas Democrats she's now looking to flip in her own race. Flores
said the National Republican Campaign Committee has pledged financial
support despite her being an underdog in the general election.
Democratic U.S. Rep. Vicente Gonzalez switched districts and is now
competing with Flores in November, and got 23,000-plus votes in securing
the Democratic nomination, more than double Flores' total. Texas gained
more residents than any state between 2010 and 2020, with Latinos
driving the growth that swelled its population to 29.1 million. Trump
won 35% of the Hispanic vote nationally in 2020, about the same as he
won in Texas, according to AP VoteCast, a nationwide survey of the
electorate. But VoteCast showed [he made inroads with Latino voters
[in]{.mark}]{.underline} some states, including
**[[Florida]{.underline}]{.mark}** (45%) [and
**[Nevada]{.mark}**]{.underline} (42%). Florida also saw its Hispanic
and overall population boom according to last year's census, and Trump
won the state twice as Republicans ousted Democratic U.S. Reps. Donna
Shalala and Debbie Mucarsel-Powell in Miami in 2020. Juan-Carlos Planas,
an election attorney and former Republican Florida state representative
who is now a Democrat, said there's time before the state's Aug. 23
primary for Democrats to make up ground. "Things could look bad today,
but you never know what will happen next," Planas said. "Do I think
Democrats need to step up in voter registration? Yes, absolutely.
Democrats need to step up their ground game." Florida voters register by
party, unlike open-primary Texas. Last year, registered Florida
Republicans outnumbered Democrats for the first time in modern history,
and the GOP's lead of active registered voters has widened in more
recent months. Trump performed well with **[[Cuban-American
voters]{.underline}]{.mark}** in South Florida and greatly narrowed
Democrats' lead in Miami-Dade County in 2020. Republican Florida Gov.
Ron DeSantis, who is up for reelection this fall and is a potential 2024
presidential candidate, organized roundtables in support of last
summer's anti-governmental protests in communist Cuba. The
**[[Biden]{.underline}]{.mark}** administration has also approached
oil-rich Venezuela and its socialist President Nicolás Maduro after
canceling U.S. oil imports from Russia --- potentially
**[[alienating]{.mark} exiled [Venezuelan-American]{.mark}
voters]{.underline}** in Florida who fled the unrest in that country.
Dan Smith, a University of Florida political scientist who studies
elections, said 2016 voters in heavily Cuban precincts had not heavily
backed Trump, but that changed in 2020. "Certainly
**[[Dem]{.mark}ocrat[s]{.mark} have [lost any advantage they once
had]{.mark}]{.underline}**," Smith said, adding that GOP efforts to
label Democratic candidates as socialist was effective among Cuban and
Venezuelan exiles.

#### Latino voters are crucial for both sides.

[The [**Latino** electorate]{.mark}]{.underline} played a decisive role
in key U.S. Senate races in 2020 and will again be [**[crucial]{.mark}**
in determining outcomes **[in]{.mark}** the **[2022]{.mark}** midterm
elections]{.underline}, according to a report published today by the
UCLA Latino Policy and Politics Institute. The report analyzes the
choices of Latinos in 2020 Senate elections in five states where Latino
voters were pivotal either because of their large numbers or the part
they played in close races: Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, New Mexico and
Texas. And with an eye toward 2022's most contested races, the authors
spotlight the frequency with which Latinos selected one party's
candidate for president and another's for the Senate. In all these
states, the authors found, Latino voters supported Democratic Senate
candidates by wide margins in 2020. In Arizona, Colorado and Georgia,
they voted for Democratic Senate candidates over Republican candidates
by a 3-to-1 margin, and in New Mexico and Texas by a 2-to-1 margin. Yet
despite this overwhelming support for Democratic Senate candidates, a
[[considerable number of Latino voters]{.underline}]{.mark} --- between
2% and 10%, depending on the state --- [[split their
ballots]{.underline}]{.mark} between parties when choosing Senate and
presidential candidates in 2020. These swing voters will likely be [a
