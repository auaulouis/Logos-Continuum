# 1AC - Toxic Techulinity

#### NATO is fundamentally a system built on the protection racket. The concept of aggression vs "rouge" entities such as Russia and China as threats to our security because they have nukes begins this endless development of toxic masculinity that ends up with the destruction of human.

[In the traditional perspective of international relations,]{.underline}
especially the realist one, human behaviour is seen as a reflection of
the state's behaviour. To cope with the anarchic world where competition
is the main characteristic, [the state has to act rationally and
aggressively, and possess great economic and military power in order to
survive.]{.underline} While the realists argue that the state is free
from gender attributes, feminists challenge this idea by arguing if the
state was a human, gender attributes are attached to it. [[In the
realist view of the state's behaviour, the state represents the value of
masculinity]{.mark}.]{.underline} Hobbes's description in Leviathan
emphasises conflict: 'so that in the nature of man, we find three
principal causes of quarrel. First, Competition; Secondly Diffidence;
Thirdly, Glory' (Tuck, 1996 cited in Nabulsi, 1999, p.85). In the
realist view, [the state possesses threats to other state, and [to
overcome the threats, the state should act rationally in taking action
or use aggression if necessary. The state seems to be playing the role
of the man in a patriarchal culture by taking up a position as protector
from foreign dangers]{.mark}. [The state's performance]{.mark} can be [a
reflection of the masculine model]{.mark}]{.underline}. Stiehm (1982
cited in Wadley, 2010, p.51) argues that 'An exposition of the gendered
logic of masculine role of protector in relation to women and children
illuminates the meaning and effective appeal of a security state that
wages war abroad and expects obedience and loyalty at home. [In this
patriarchal logic[, the role of the masculine protector puts those
protected, paradigmatically women and children, in a subordinate
position of dependence and obedience'. Using militarisation as a means
to protect state survival, the state comes up with a rational,
defence-offence strategy, one in which war is a legitimate
instrument]{.mark} of this strategy.]{.underline} Feminists argue that
[[war and militarisation are products of the masculine and, at the same
time, means of masculinizing people]{.mark}.]{.underline} In her book,
J. Ann Tickner (2001, cited in Wadley, 2010, p.44) stated that through
war, "power is valorised and identified with heroic kind of
masculinity". Agressive character attached to men made them more involve
in war, and through their position in politics and military to declare
war (Wilcox, 2010). During wartime, men carry the moral responsibilities
of nationalism and protection of the country, both of which are
portrayals of masculine traits. [[In the name of protection, using
offensive action is often justifiable]{.mark} to be
conducted]{.underline}. During World War I and World War II, states were
reacting to dangers that were often coming from outside sources. Sjoberg
(2006, cited in Wilcox, 2010, p.74) argued that [chivalric masculinity
is not solely about men; the just narrative involves 'good guys' or
'just warriors' who fight against 'bad guys' for just and valorous
reasons]{.underline}. Elshtain (1995, cited in Wilcox, 2010, p.74) added
that in order to produce the chivalric masculinity of the 'just
warriors', a 'beautiful soul' and a malevolent other are needed. During
World War I the British military engaged in offensive strategies and the
cult of offensive to defend civilisation or impose civilising values on
the barbarity of Germany (Wilcox, 2010). [The notion of protection has
become a moral obligation to provide security in domestic environment
and international communities. Globalisation has introduced human
security as a new agenda for international security.]{.underline}
Protecting human rights is a responsibility shared by international
communities. [When states are unable or unwilling to protect their own
citizens, the responsibilities will be shifted to the broader
international community]{.underline}. In September 2005[, all United
Nations member states agreed to accept the concept of 'Responsibility to
Protect'. In some cases the responsibility to protect has triggered new
wars called humanitarian wars. [Feminists view this as an attempt to
expand the scope of masculine protection.]{.mark}]{.underline} Anne
Orford (1999, cited in Wilcox, 2010, p.76) stated that [[the various
humanitarian wars of the 1990s can be read as a narrative in which NATO
and other actors re-invent themselves as masculine, heroic rescuers of
weak and passive victims.]{.mark}]{.underline} After the tragedy of
September 11, 2001, a series of United States invasions in Afghanistan
and Iraq had more of an agenda than simply being a 'War on Terror'.
Invasion also served the image of United States as 'liberator' for the
weak. The mission of 'liberating' Afghan women was used to stoke public
opinions to support the invasion of Afghanistan, and served also to
reduce feminist protest against the war (Wilcox, 2010; Eisenstein, 2002;
Charlesworth and Chinki, 2002). Highlighting the Taliban discrimination
of women in Afghanistan has become the justification of the invasion.
The mission of 'liberating' people also showed up in United States
invasion of Iraq. The story of rescuing a defenceless Iraqi people from
the evil tyranny and oppression of Saddam Hussein underpinned the heroic
quest for protection. Identity, boundaries, ideology, and nationalism
are all reasons for men to go for war. For a long time, serving one's
country was seen as a chivalric way to gain honour. Society has an
important role in shaping what a man should be and must do. By joining
the army and fighting on the battlefield, a man has been understood to
be defending his honour and his home. Wilcox (2010) said that the
[military serves as an important site for the creation and maintenance
of gender identity in society.]{.underline} Military training emphasises
physical exercise to build up strength, offensive and aggressive
techniques, and an ability to cope under stressful conditions on the
battlefield. [During wartime, the state becomes a citizen-warrior that
endorses the value of the warrior's masculinity]{.underline}. Military
[training has the aim to create or build the individual characteristics
of men]{.underline}. And indeed the military is an institution in which
masculine characteristics are the basic requirements, and individuals
who want to enter this institution must adjust to its prerequisites.
Barry Posen (1984, cited in Wilcox, 2010, p.70) described the
attractiveness of offensive doctrines to militaries as resulting from
the military as an organisation driven to increase its own autonomy and
self-image. Similarly, David Englander (1997, cited in Wilcox, 2010,
p.70) argued that the offensive spirit in the British military leading
up to World War I expressed the military's position as the vanguard of a
virile, manly nation. [[Military power has been examined as gender
symbolic to show the manliness of a state or
decision-makers]{.underline}]{.mark}. A military parade, usually
performed during a state's Independence Day, is an opportunity to
exhibit the masculinity of the state. [In wartime the [construction of a
hyper-masculine of state is a necessity to undermine the enemy and
characterise them as effeminate objects]{.mark}.]{.underline} As Cohn,
Hill and Ruddick (2005) wrote, the using of masculine propaganda, such
as 'We had to prove that we are not eunuchs' and 'Made with Viagra', are
frequently used when India exploded five nuclear devices in May 1998.
Maruska (2010) stated that the U.S.--led 'war on terror' after the 9/11
bombing, was a desire to establish a hyper-masculine image of George H.
Bush and the United States.

#### The topic's proposal of cooperation among the NATO allies positions the "great powers" as a genderless-agents, obfuscating the state as a site of gendered performativity creating a situation of masculine powers vs masculine powers while those who don't have a nuclear arsenal are left on the side lines to obey and be the "submissive" citizen to the nuclear overlords. 

**Wadley, 2010.** (Jonathan, PhD in IR from Florida and currently
professor of IR and sexual politics at San Diego. "Gendering the State:
Performativity and Protection in International Security," in *Gender and
International Security* edited by Laura Sjoberg, pp. 40-41 - spp)

[[The analysis presented here challenges the discipline's tendency to
treat states as genderless persons]{.mark} by exploring the role of
gender in the security performances of states. [In doing so, it draws
upon the concept of performativity]{.mark} -- the idea
that]{.underline}, in the words of Judith Butler, "[identity is
performatively constituted by the very 'expression' that are said to be
its results."]{.underline} It argues that [performances within the field
of security,]{.underline} much like performances within the daily lives
of people, [carry no intrinsic meaning, but [must be made sense of
through "a system of symbolic meaning" that cannot be but gendered.
Through such performances]{.mark}, identities become salient, and
[masculine and feminine subjects are created]{.mark}.]{.underline} While
this process is less palpable for states than it is for humans, it is
nonetheless observable in broad patterns. [[States can be observed
reifying themselves through performances of security]{.mark},
particularly through those which [establish]{.mark} them [as]{.mark}
stable and [masculine protectors]{.mark}]{.underline}. Recent work on
the politics of protection, particularly that done by Didier Bigo,
[suggests the constitutive effects that protection has upon both
providers and recipients.]{.underline} It stops short, however, of
recognizing that these effects may be enabled by the gendered meaning
that different forms of protection carry. When such meanings are
considered, it becomes evident that [[by "being" masculine protectors,
states can position themselves favorably in relation to other
international actors and gain legitimacy from their domestic
audiences]{.mark}. This means that states are gendered, and are gendered
in much the same way as people are: through repeated
performances.]{.underline} When state identity is viewed in this light,
the anthropomorphic assumption, as it is commonly used, appears woefully
inadequate. To be clear, it is not being suggested that drawing
parallels between human subjects and state subjects is bad
in-and-of-itself. Indeed, useful parallels can be drawn, despite (or,
perhaps, because of) the notion that "both states and persons are fuzzy
sets." The [trouble lies in assuming that states, or people, are
constituted outside processes of interaction, and that either can be
made sense of without considering the relational identities they take on
through the systems of symbolic meaning through which they operate.
[Anthropomorphic assumptions tend to treat the state as a
genderless]{.mark}, unitary actor -- often, one that is ontologically
primitive to its interactions -- [while neglecting the ways that]{.mark}
[the "actor-ness]{.mark}" and "unity" [of the state are an effect
of]{.mark} iterated, [gendered performances]{.mark}, particularly
[in]{.mark} the realm of [security]{.mark}.]{.underline} By viewing
security performances with an eye toward their constitutive effects, and
[[by moving gender to the center of]{.mark} that [analysis, one gains
not only]{.mark} [a richer understanding of how states reproduce
themselves]{.mark}]{.underline} (i.e. where their person-like
"identities" come from), [[but a clearer picture of the hierarchical
relations that exist]{.mark} among states and between states and
domestic populations.]{.underline} This chapter begins with a
consideration of how the state has been conceived of a person throughout
the discipline, arguing that such practices almost always import an
inadequate understanding of how people are constituted. In both cases,
conceptualizing states and conceptualizing humans -- this is a result,
largely, of substance-oriented, as opposed to process-oriented,
approaches. It argues [that by making processes, rather than substances,
the core of research, scholars will be able to more fully explain how
states reproduce themselves as actors in world politics, how they garner
power for themselves (in relation to other international actors,
particularly states), [and how they gain legitimacy from their
subjects]{.mark}.]{.underline} Following that, the chapter argues that
[[a theory of performativity can fill this need, especially in the realm
of Security Studies]{.mark}.]{.underline} Moreover, [such a theory would
facilitate the study of gender within these processes and shed light on
the incentives states have to behave as masculine actors.]{.underline}
The final section of the chapter offers, tentatively, a way for
empirical research to bear on the theoretical sketches presented here.
It submits that "the rational protector model" may be examined as a type
of dominant masculinity for states, one which allows them to "do"
security ways that cast them as unitary, masculine actors.

#### Gender is the core concept of the protection racket -- the idea of "saving women from men" is the justification of the violence. This is why masculine qualities are to have hypermilitarized compounds that are ready to fight and "save" the feminized subjects. There is no problem, they were the ones who are insecure about other nations and want to perfect them by securing them.

INTERSECTIONALITY AND \"FEMINIZATION AS DEVALORIZATION\" For a variety
of reasons elaborated elsewhere (Peterson, 2005), I find the
theory/practice emerging from feminist and critical race scholarship
particularly fruitful for analyzing intersectionality. On the one hand,
**[[feminisms have]{.mark} transdisciplinary and complex [analytical
resources for investigating and theorizing about identity, difference,
and structural hierarchies]{.mark}.]{.underline}** On the other hand,
**[differences among women have forced feminist]{.underline}**s (too
often reluctantly and always uncomfortably**[) to reflect critically on
the meaning of feminism,]{.underline}** operations of power among women,
the politics of representation, **[and the dangers of
overgeneralizing]{.underline}**. As one consequence, feminist
scholarship has contributed to a richer understanding of analytics and
politics, or theory and practice, as interdependent. **[[Key to this
development is understanding gender as both an empirical and analytical
categor]{.mark}y.]{.underline}** The former refers to the embodied and
ostensibly biological binary of male-female sex difference. Understood
empirically, gender can be deployed as a variable to investigate, for
example, how women and men are differently affected by, and differently
participate in, political and economic practices. This is the more
familiar use of gender in contemporary research, especially in the
social sciences. **[Analytical gender is less familiar; it refers to the
signifying system of masculine-feminine differentiations that
constitutes a governing code]{.underline}**. The claim here is that
**[gender pervades language and culture,]{.underline}** **[systemically
shaping not only who we are but how we think and what we]{.underline}**
**[do]{.underline}**. As historically constituted, **[the [dichotomy of
gender codes masculine qualities as oppositional to and more highly
valued than feminine qualities]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}
Understanding gender analytically then generates a crucial and
transformative feminist insight: **[the ([symbolic, discursive) cultural
privileging of that which is identified with masculinity is key to
naturalizing the (symbolic, discursive, cultural, corporeal, material,
economic) power relations that constitute multiple forms of
subjection]{.mark}.]{.underline}** **[This knowledge allows for more
adequately theorizing, and hence politicizing,
intersectionality]{.underline}**. More specifically**[, feminist
research documents the contingent and historical \"normalization\" of
gender as a systemic code valorizing that which is characterized and
privileged as masculine (reason, agency, control, objectivity, etc.) at
the expense of that which is stigmatized as feminine (emotion,
passivity, uncertainty, subjectivity, etc.).]{.underline}** Two points
are key. First**[, gender is relational, so that privileging who and
what is masculinized is inextricable from devaluing who and what is
feminized. Recognizing the interdependence]{.underline}** of masculinity
and femininity-one \"requires\" the other-provides particular analytical
leverage. It **[[displaces the prevailing tendency to think gender is
primarily about women]{.underline}]{.mark}**, insisting instead that
**[gender necessarily and invariably involves masculinity as much as
femininity]{.underline}**. Similarly, **[[it reminds us that gender is
systemic]{.underline}]{.mark}**, so that **[[manifestations of gender
are less individual \"choices\" than effects of codes, institutionalized
norms, and rules]{.mark}.]{.underline}** second, **[the privileging of
masculinity does not privilege all men or only men]{.underline}**. The
claim is rather that [**[gender]{.underline}**-]{.mark}with its lauded
masculinity and denigrated femininity[-**[pervades language and culture
and]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[[devalorizes all feminized
statuses]{.mark},]{.underline}** including those occupied by
subordinated men. Romanticism notwithstanding, the more an individual or
a social category is feminized, the more likely (not invariably) that
its devaluation is assumed, or presumed to be \"explained.\" In short,
diverse hierarchies are linked and ideologically \"naturalized\" by
feminizing those who are subordinated. I understand this insight as key
to advancing intersectional analysis. The insight involves several
interactive \"moves.\" In one sense, **[casting the subordinated as
feminine devalorizes not only the empirical gender category of women but
also sexually, racially, culturally, and economically marginalized men
(e.g., \"lazy migrants,\" \'primitive natives,\" \"effeminate
gays\")]{.underline}**. Underpinning this claim is the observation that,
**[while structural hierarchies vary by reference to the \"difference\"
emphasized and modalities of power involved, they typically share a
common feature: the denigration of feminized qualities attributed to
those who are subordinated (lacking reason, agency, control,
etc.).]{.underline}** **[Invoking the \"natural\" inferiority of the
feminine plays a powerful]{.underline}**, though not exhaustive, **[role
in legitimating these hierarchies. I]{.underline}**n a second sense, and
understanding gender analytically, **[not only subjects (women and
marginalized men), but also concepts, desires, tastes, styles, \"ways of
knowing,\" cultural expressions (art, music), roles, practices, work,
and nature, etc., can be feminized-with the effect of reducing their
legitimacy, status, and value]{.underline}**. Importantly, **[this
devalorization is simultaneously ideological (discursive, cultural) and
material (structural, economic).]{.underline}** Consider how \"women\'s
work\"-whether done by women or marginalized men-is typically under
paid, or frequently not paid at all; and we hardly notice, in part
because the depreciation of feminized activities is so taken for
granted. **[[This devalorization normalizes-with the effect of
\"legitimating\"-the marginalization, subordination, and exploitation of
feminized practices and persons]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Oppressions
differ, as do attempts to explain and/or justify them. As Wendy Brown
(1997:86-7) states, \"not simply the content but the modalities of power
producing gender, race, or caste are specific to each production,\" even
though \"these powers of subject formation are not separable in the
subject itself.\" Because oppressions take various structural forms,
feminization is not the only \"normalizing\" ideology in operation. I
argue, however, that what distinguishes feminization and renders it so
ideologically powerful is the unique extent to which it invokes a deeply
internalized and naturalized binary-the essentialized concept of sex
difference-which is then \"available\" to naturalize diverse forms of
structural oppression. This warrants clarification. Even as sex and
gender are increasingly ambiguous to some, most people most of the time
take a categorical, essentialized distinction between male and female
completely for granted: as biologically \"given,\" reproductively
necessary, and psycho-socially \"obvious.\" Yet constructionists argue
not only that sex difference itself is produced-through contingent,
historical practices and institutionalizations-but also that sex
difference as an essentialized binary and masculinism as a system of
asymmetrical power are co-constituted. In other words, the deeply
sedimented concept of sex difference and historically institutionalized
practices of gender hierarchy are mutually constituted. As one effect,
the \"naturalness\" of sex difference is generalized to the
\"naturalness\" of masculine (not necessarily male) privilege, so that
both aspects come to be taken-for-granted \"givens\" of social life. The
given cultural code of reason, control, agency, etc., as masculine, and
irrationality, weakness, passivity, etc., as feminine is then
ideologically available for legitimating other forms of domination as
well**[. Common sense becomes a two-pronged justification of hierarchy.
On the one hand, subordinated individuals or groups are devalorized by
feminization; depictions range from lack of capacity and being weak or
irrational, to being offensive or posing a danger. On the other hand,
responding appropriately to such individuals or [groups \"requires\"
masculinized practices; these range from patronizing and protectionist
behaviors to disciplinary measures and violent coercion]{.mark}. In
short, not only are the subordinated devalorized by feminization, but
the qualities they \"lack\" are typically just what the dominating
(masculinized) group has to offer, or is \"compelled\" to practice. This
conveniently justifies both the \"necessity\" of rule and who should
rule. The common sense of privileging the masculine and devaluing the
feminine is culturally and collectively internalized to such an extent
that we are all variously complicit in its reproduction]{.underline}**.
**[And it is also implicitly and explicitly manipulated to reproduce
inequalities as if this were natural and inevitable, thus making
critique and resistance difficult. In short, devalorizing the feminine
produces even as it obscures vast inequalities of power, authority, and
resource distribution. Exposing how this power operates must be one
objective of a critical political agenda]{.underline}**. With these
points in mind, I argue that **[the transformative potential of feminist
critique lies in exposing and subverting all hierarchies that rely on
denigration of \"the feminine\" to normalize and depoliticize
subjection. I am not arguing that gender hierarchy is the \"primary\"
oppression overshadowing race or class or sexuality]{.underline}**. The
point is rather that **[gender hierarchy and its elevation of
\"masculinity\" is a historically contingent structural feature of
social relations, that the subordination of women is not reducible to
other structural oppressions (or vice versa), and that the dichotomy of
gender underpins-as the denigration of the feminine
naturalizes-hierarchies of gender, class, race, sexualities and
geopolitical \"difference.]{.underline}**\" Because forms of subjection
differ structurally, systematic and comparative analyses of RGCS require
attention to \"different histories, different mechanisms and sites of
power, different discursive formations, different regulatory schemes\"
(Brown, 1997:86). In this essay, however, my focus is less on the
production of subjection than exposing the political work that
collective and internalized gender coding does across multiple forms of
subjection. I am not presuming that sexist oppression is the most
salient or powerful hierarchy in any particular context; I am arguing
that investigating feminization as devalorization allows a broader
understanding of how racial, sexual, class, and other oppressions are
naturalized and provides us with greater analytical/political leverage.
While this is only one among a number of critical insights to be
expanded and applied,31 consider it a particularly productive vantage
point, and especially in relation to militarization and
war.INTERSECTIONALITY IN MILITARIZATION AND WARS In a recent volume,
Hunt and Rygiel (2006:3) develop the concept of **[\"([en)gendering\"
war to \"disrupt and make visible the masculinized,militarized,
racialized, sexualized, and classed dynamics through which war
operates.]{.mark}]{.underline}**[\"]{.mark} They argue that official
\"**[war stories\" do political work: they camouflage interests, agendas
and politics that underpin war for the purpose of legitimating and
gaining support for militarization]{.underline}**. **[A crucial aspect
of their effectiveness is the extent to which they depend on gendered
ideologies]{.underline}** **[(masculinization and feminization) that are
naturalized and therefore go \"unnoticed\"]{.underline}** (2006:5).
**[[By going unnoticed ideologies are depoliticized even as the
identities and practices they mobilize profoundly affect
politics]{.mark}.]{.underline}** In the remainder of the paper I use
triad analytics to explore how feminization accomplishes typically
unnoticed political work in war stories. In other words, **[how does the
valorization of masculinized identities, ideologies, and actions operate
in contexts of militarism and war?]{.underline}** T**[he most familiar
theme in war stories involves constructing the \"enemy\" as
\"other\"]{.underline}**: to distinguish \"us\" from \"them,\" render
\"others\" in some sense inferior, and thereby **[justify war\'s
violence against \"them.\" The specifics of othering vary by history and
context]{.underline}**, but invariably involve some form of
objectification so that \"they\" become objects to which norms of
respect and non-violation need not be extended. Historical othering
ranges from early Greeks characterizing Persians as effeminate, to
Christians casting non-believers as immoral, to Europeans depicting
\"natives\" as uncivilized. [**[Thinking through how othering occurs in
nationalist, colonial, and contemporary war stories reveals gendered
identity investments and ideologies in operation]{.underline}**.]{.mark}
**[Critics of European imperialism have produced a wealth of research
documenting the manipulation of ideologies to justify colonial wars and
obscure their racist, economic, and heteronormative
dynamics]{.underline}** (Said, 1979; 1993; Spivak, 1987;Chatterjee,
1989; Stoler, 1991;McClintock, 1995). **[What surface repeatedly are
characterizations of the colonized as feminine: weak, passive,
irrational, disorderly, unpredictable, lacking self-control,
economically and politically incompetent]{.underline}**. **[European
power-wielders]{.underline}** (not only men or all men**[) could then
justify military interventions by casting themselves in favorable
masculinist terms]{.underline}**: **[as uniquely rational, sexually and
morally respectable]{.underline}**, and more advanced economically and
politically. In colonial wars and geopolitical maneuvering,
\"**[civilization\" became a code word for European
superiority]{.underline}**, and **[the identity of \"Europeans\" was
valorized]{.underline}**. Through this lens, **[military interventions
were perhaps a regrettable but nonetheless a necessary component of
\"enlightening\" and \"civilizing\" primitive, unruly (feminized)
\"others]{.underline}**.\" As Eisenstein (2004:75) observes, while they
extolled the virtues of reason as a progressive force, **[Europeans
positioned rationality \"against savagery (natives), emotionality
(women), and sexuality (racialized others]{.underline}**).\" At the same
time-and complicating simplistic models of gender-**[the development of
European nationalisms and normalization of bourgeois respectability
produced an idealized model of femininity, pure, dutiful,
materna]{.underline}**l. **[This superficial valorization of femininity
is contradicted by the practices it invoked]{.underline}**. **[Women
were expected to think and act in feminine ways]{.underline}**, and to
feel good about their feminine identity. But romanticizing the
\"maternal feminine\" did less to empower women than render them
perpetual dependents. **[[Feminine]{.mark} virtue and [morality were
best assured by confining these qualities]{.mark}-and (bourgeois[)
women-]{.mark}to a private sphere of domesticity and [assigning men the
public sphere responsibility of defending and protecting feminized
dependents]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Rather than empowering European
women, **[the idealization of bourgeois (heteronormative) femininity
became a tool for disempowering non-European men]{.underline}**. **[The
patronizing and protectionist logic of bourgeois norms provided imperial
governments a moral, as well as rational, justification for militarized
colonization]{.underline}**. In this war story, the barbarity of
\"other\" men was proven by their (allegedly) oppressive treatment of
women, and this demanded the rescue of victimized females by honorable,
civilized men. In short**[, [the protection of idealized
femininity]{.mark} (]{.underline}**to paraphrase Spivak\'s (1987) apt
analysis) **[justified wars [by white men to \"save\" brown women from

ideological commitments, and militarized practices
interact.]{.underline}** Some argue that George W. **[Bush\'s
\"forceful\" response to the 9/11 bombings involved not only his outrage
and claim to military leadership, but also his desire to establish a
hypermasculine image of himself and the United States]{.underline}**. It
is well-known that **[Bush had personal reasons for enhancing his
militarist (manly) identity]{.underline}**. He had avoided serving in
Vietnam, was invested in the image of being a \"guy\'s guy,\" and
arguably hoped to redeem his father\'s failure to oust Saddam in the
first Gulf War. For many Americans, **[the identity and power of the US
had been feminized by its defeat in Vietnam,]{.underline}** **[made more
humiliating by losing to a people stereotyped as ethnically/racially
inferior]{.underline}**. Feminization anxiety was also fueled by the
increasing visibility of women in politics and the workplace and the
growing strength of LGBT political movements**[. A yearning to
remasculinize the nation]{.underline}** ( Jeffords 1989) **[was already
present and readily tapped by Bush and his advisors as the nation

skeptical, or who actively opposed Bush\'s strategies were rendered

crusading protectionism to justify his warring agenda and disable
feminist critiques]{.underline}**.5 Like earlier imperial powers, as it
embarked on its post-9/11 military actions**[, the US claimed to be
liberating women of Afghanistan and Iraq: rescuing \"other\" women from
the \"barbaric\" conditions of their subjection to the Taliban and
Islamic fundamentalists.]{.underline}** Zine (2007:34) captures
succinctly the political work of this war story: \"the **[archetypal
image of the deprived and debased Muslim woman was resurrected to
perform her duty as a signifier of the abject difference of
Muslims]{.underline}**; the barbarity and anti-modernism of Islam and
its essential repression of women; and most importantly as camouflage
for US military interventions.\" These were not the only \"official\"
stories told to justify the \"war on terror.\" But the **[political
-work that they did was crucial. They constructed an \"enemy\" who was
unpredictable, religiously (irrationally) motivated, indiscriminately
violent, and bent on destroying (Western) civilization]{.underline}**.
**[This foreclosed any \"reasoned\" engagement and legitimated a
strategy of annihilation.]{.underline}** In conjunction with other
factors and forces, these **[stories worked to build a modicum of
\"consent\" and a modest \"coalition of the willing\" that enabled the
US to proceed with its war and claim it was not acting
unilaterally]{.underline}**. These stories rendered critique and
opposition not just suspect but dangerously treasonous and capable of
imperiling the project of saving civilization. **[Through variously
feminizing diverse sets of actors, the Bush administration\'s war
stories undercut dissent and legitimated extremes of surveillance and
containment]{.underline}**, quickly implemented against those the ruling
regime deemed suspect. In short, **[these official war stories worked
powerfully to justify the \"war on terror\" and gain at least the
appearance of consent.]{.underline}** The US government and its
coalition partners invaded Afghanistan and subsequently Iraq.
**[Investments in gendered identities and commitments to masculinist
ideologies mattered for initiating the \"war on terror,\" and they also
matter within processes of militarization]{.underline}**.
**[Militaries]{.underline}**, of course, are **[quintessential sites of
hypermasculinity]{.underline}**. Success in war is presumed to demand a
constellation of qualities long considered the exclusive province of
men: superior physical strength, incomparable male bonding, heroic
risk-taking, extremes of violence, and readiness to sacrifice one\'s
life for the cause. Historically, military service afforded decisive
proof of manhood and constituted a claim to citizenship. The valorized
identities and ideals of military service continue to fuel recruitment
and enlistment activities, with the increasingly crucial addition of
economic incentives. Masculinist qualities remain key to military life
but are complicated in today\'s services by a variety of differences
among men (by ethnicity, race, religion, class, skills) as well as by
the inclusion of women. Within militaries, multiple masculinities and
their emotional investments are differently mobilized in pursuit of
warring objectives.6 More physically powerful and hypermasculine men are
valued but subordinated to orders from above; commanding officers, with
their presumed leadership competence, enjoy higher prestige and less
ambivalent valorization. Increasing reliance on advanced technologies
prompts new masculinities. While desk jobs that distance soldiers from
the battle front were previously feminized, computer specialists and
high-tech operators today are increasingly valorized (Blanchard, 2003).
If we consider the education and training required for these positions,
classed and raced dimensions of masculinities come into view. Indeed,
the techno-war paradigm of the US military presents a new version of
western superiority: high tech sophistication, efficiency, and
\"awesome\" power. Intersectional analysis is particularly complicated
by the increasing numbers of women in military service, who face
conflicting expectations and manipulations of their femininity,
masculinity, and sexuality.7 The effects of women\'s inclusion are
variously interpreted, with no easy conclusions. Some analysts argue
that women\'s presence humanizes and democratizes militaries-perhaps
even rendering them less masculinist. Others are less optimistic. Given
traditional expectations of virile, aggressive hypermasculinity,
militaries are treacherous places for anyone who is feminized. Women
especially-but not exclusively-are at risk. Through a triadic lens,
however much female soldiers struggle to \"prove\" and sustain their
identification as sufficiently masculine, ideologies of male supremacy
and practices of sexual violence undermine their efforts. Lack of
structural equality (and respect) between men and women in everyday
life, enduring stereotypes of female dependence and physical
inferiority, the embodiment of sex difference (menstruation, pregnancy),
and the objectification of women as sexual targets interact to pose
multiple threats to military women.8 These are in addition to the
dangers they face as soldiers in war zones. Whether or not the presence
of women humanizes militaries, **[[the presumed femininity of women
soldiers]{.underline}]{.mark}** (contradicting the masculinism demanded
of them) **[[is variously manipulated in support of military
objectives]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The US-led \"Operation Iraqi
Freedom\" provides stunning examples of how the femininity, masculinity,
and sexuality of female soldiers can be mobilized. The images from these
war stories are familiar, but the gender, racial, and geopolitical
politics underpinning them have largely gone unnoticed in public
discourse. For instance, soon after the invasion of Iraq, the March 2003
capture of US Army Private Jessica Lynch and her subsequent rescue was a
major media event. While initial reports praised her soldiering in the
face of enemy fire, these were quickly overshadowed by feminizing her
plight: a white woman subject to \"rape by Arab men\" had to be
spectacularly rescued. The story worked to reproduce the virtue and
vulnerability of (white) womanhood, the demonization of Iraqi men, and
the heroic efforts of US Special Forces to \"save\" her from presumed
abuse. Equally important, the story also served Bush\'s military agenda
by diverting attention from the increasingly visible Iraqi resistance,
the flaws in US policy and preparedness, and the larger questions these
raised. When accounts of abuse, rape, and torture of prisoners in the
Abu Ghraib prison surfaced in late 2003, European and American audiences
especially were \"shocked\" by the photos that were broadcast worldwide.
There was the shock of viewing graphic abuse and the shame of coalition
(\"civilized\") soldiers as perpetrators. But most disturbing were
photos of American women torturing Arab men. The official war story
blamed \"a few bad apples,\" thus avoiding more critical interrogation
of behaviors cultivated by militarism, valorized masculinism, and
deteriorating security conditions in Iraq. Blaming the few was
apparently persuasive to many in the US, where identification as the
\"good guys\" carries deep emotional investments and encourages
collective amnesia about US racism and military atrocities. The initial
outrage and political furor were quickly eclipsed by the (Western)
media\'s focus not on the implications of torture and the reality of
failing military policies, but on the sensational photos. These were
both an easier story to \"sell\" and could serve multiple purposes.
Several points warrant our notice. Fascination with the photos derived
from many sources and tapped feelings of both repulsion and attraction.
The pictures recalled images of Nazi concentration camps for some, and
white voyeurism at racial lynchings for others. Even as they depicted
abuse, the sexualized poses also eroticized domination. Goldstein (in
Brittain, 2006) observes that viewing a pyramid of exposed buttocks
invited homoerotic arousal, while the presence of a grinning woman
allayed any homosexual anxiety about that arousal. As critiques of US
policies and calls for secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld\'s
resignation intensified, the media focus shifted. At least 1600 photos
were made available for Congressional screening. Presumably there were
more numerous images of men abusing men, yet these were displaced by a
few photos featuring Lynndie England-a (white) woman-sexually
humiliating (brown) men. England quickly became the focal point of
condemnation. Details of England\'s personal life (early divorce,
out-of-wedlock pregnancy, romance with an accused wife-beater)
effectively constructed her as a very \"improper\" woman who appeared to
revel in doing \"improper\" things (Brittain, 2006:88). For critics of
the US, the Abu Ghraib photos, and especially those of England,
confirmed the moral hypocrisy of American righteousness. The US-not
alone but most blatantly-was prosecuting a deadly war in the absence of
(rational?) foresight and planning, and on the basis of \"faulty
intelligence\" that was increasingly exposed as willful
misrepresentations. It was snubbing its nose at (civilized?)
international law and human rights conventions, while claiming moral
superiority and a crusading protectionist commitment to freedom and
democracy. And the arrogance displayed in the photos was demoralizing to
all who identified with the Islamic faith and/or sympathized with
embattled Iraqis. The damage to US credibility and national
interests-including the security of its soldiers and the safety of its
homeland-was inestimable. Some feared, others hoped, that the scandal of
Abu Ghraib would bring down the Bush administration and prompt a
reassessment of the war in Iraq. Instead, Bush staunchly defended
Rumsfeld, the war raged on, and the President was re-elected in
November. Without denying the enormous complexity of how this
transpired, I want to insist that we \"notice\" the media\'s complicity
and what the official war stories obscured. The most telling point is
the timing of these stories and hence their political effects. The shift
to sensationalist Abu Ghraib abuse photos and their feminized depravity
diverted attention from the implications of the US government\'s
expanding detention activities, engaging in torture, and disregarding
international conventions. Pornographic images of a \"bad girl\" did the
political work of side-lining the issue of rights and suppressing debate
about the war\'s objectives and operational practices. A second point is
how the gendered and racialized messages in the images camouflaged
neo-imperialist interests. Casting England as the ultimate \"bad apple\"
positioned her as the problem, rather than the predominately male power
wielders and the policies of the US government. England and a very few
others paid with demotions and prison sentences while Bush and his
regime escaped blame and accountability. Spoiled femininity took the rap
for imperial masculinity. We might also notice how casting England as
the depraved figure of femininity avoided all interrogation of
privileged (white)masculinity and its arguably \"depraved\" history of
violence. The most obvious examples include racial lynchings, torture
and death of detainees, rape as a weapon of war, fire bombings, nuclear
weapons, environmental warfare, use of land mines, and the
indiscriminate maiming and killing of civilians. In addition, the
England story completely diverted attention from the violence cultivated
within militaries by hypermasculinist norms-violence which is practiced
not only against external enemies but against all who are feminized,
including service women themselves. Major media rarely turn their notice
to the repetitive incidents of sexual harassment, rape and other forms
of violence against women (and gays) in US military organizations. These
incidents are now extensively documented, though the accused are rarely
prosecuted and-like detention and torture practices-even more rarely
punished. Finally, and in spite of the incalculable damage done to
individual lives and American reputation by the abuses at Abu Ghraib,
the official war stories focused attention in ways that still managed to
serve an imperialist agenda: \"The images of Arab men being broken,
subdued, shamed, and disciplined by a white woman allow for the
realization of the \'American dream\' of the total demasculinization and
humiliation of Arab men\" (Brittain, 2006:89), assuring the American
public that \"they are still on \'top\' in terms of their ability to
inflict sexual humiliation and violence on the Iraqi enemy\" (Brittain,
2006:91). INTERSECTIONALITIES OF MASCULINISM, MILITARISM, AND
IMPERIALISM I introduced triad analytics as a tool for improving our
analyses of social relations, arguing **[that emotional investments and
cultural productions are inextricable from material
practice]{.underline}**s. I used this framing to explore RGC and S in
contexts of militarism and war, and to demonstrate how feminization
devalorizes. To conclude, I review how gendered identities, ideologies,
and activities are mutually constituted and operate to normalize
domination and violence**[. [No one escapes gender socialization and its
historically sedimented norms of
heterosexism]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} **[We cannot help but be
invested in identities that our culture deems appropriate,
\"necessary,\" and worthy of esteem. While we are not locked into
unchanging or monological scripts, following paths of least resistance
is easier than not conforming-much less actively criticizing \"the way
things are.\"]{.underline}** Because the naturalized \"given\" of binary
sex difference is coded into gender identities and ideologies, it gives
the status quo inordinate power to obstruct critique and
transformation**[. Females are typically cast as, and socialized into,
subjectivities and roles that feature dependence, accommodation, lack of
personal autonomy and power, and \"consent\" to male
domination]{.underline}**. The effects of conformity \"invite\"
ideologies of protection, if not contempt. Women who defy the
stereotypes are deemed suspect, social problems and \"unnatural\"
(African American \"matriarchs,\" \"antifamily\" career women,
\"man-hating\" feminists, \"depraved\" torturers). Males are no less-and
in important respects, more abusively-socialized into subjectivities and
roles that feature aggression, being \"in control\" (emotionally,
physically, politically, economically), and denying anxiety,
ambivalence, and vulnerability. Conforming to gender expectations costs
men-and women and societies-dearly. As \"compensation,\" men are
accorded a sense of entitlement: to autonomy, power, and sexual
access**[. Objectified and subordinate \"others\" may require protection
but are also \"at the disposal\" of their superiors. This is the central
dilemma constituted by gendering: the specific qualities of (weak,
agentless) femininity \"demand\" a corollary exercise of (powerful,
entitled) masculinity]{.underline}** (see Stiehm, 1982; Brown, 1992; and
Young, 2003). Not surprisingly, most men attempt to comply, often at
high personal cost. Because the edifice of masculinity is a mythic
construction, the pressure to \"prove\" one\'s manhood is relentless.
However much individual males struggle to sustain their identification
as sufficiently masculine, it is perpetually subject to challenge.
**[[One can be \"unmanned\" (feminized) by any evidence, or worse yet,
simply the accusation of \"gayness,\" weakness, or lack of control.
Potential failure, and the despised vulnerability it invokes, is ever
present. This is true for all masculinities, no matter race or
class]{.mark}.]{.underline}** This relentless pressure is particularly
acute on the stage of political and military power. **[The [stakes are
high]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[especially in the context of impending
or ongoing war. Leaders and soldiers [respond accordingly-with displays
of hypermasculinism]{.mark}]{.underline}**: President Bush \"must\"
prove himself and US invincibility, civilized nations \"must\" assert
cultural superiority, soldiers \"must\" torture to secure intelligence,
suspect others \"must\" be detained, civilians \"must\" be patriotic,
critics \"must\" be silenced, deeper questions \"must\" be postponed.
Official war stories not only camouflage the agenda of power-wielders
during war; they also obscure the reproduction of hierarchies in
everyday life**[. Their tacit (and sometimes explicit) manipulation of
gender coding does the political work of normalizing]{.underline}**,
hence, **[depoliticizing how gender operates to perpetuate inequalities
and the violence that attends them.]{.underline}** The core dilemma of
gender plays throughout: **[constructing women and feminized others in
ways that demand masculinized identities and action.]{.underline}**
**[This is so taken for granted that alternative-to say nothing of
structurally \"equal\"-arrangements are rendered unthinkable. [In the
\"war on terror,\" gender coding reproduces feminized others who must be
protected, controlled, detained, or eliminated by masculinized agents of
ruling states]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Like advocates of neoliberal
capitalism are forever telling us: \"**[there is no
alternative.]{.underline}**\" **[The systemic effects constitute a
triadic tragedy of global proportions: hypermasculinized identity
investments, arrogant ideological claims, and excessive-arguably
depraved-military practices. Critics of imperialism have exposed how the
idealization of (Western) femininity has been manipulated to justify
western wars to \"save\" \"other\" women.]{.underline}**
**[Understanding feminization as devalorization affords an additional
insight: that marginalized men more generally are subject to this
crusading and protectionist \"logic\"-in colonial wars to \"modernize\"
gender relations, nationalist wars to promote idealized families,
invasions to \"liberate\" oppressed groups, wars on terror to eliminate
the \"irrational religious,\" wars on poverty that demoralize the
(racialized) underclass, and battles against HIV/AIDs that demonize gay
men.]{.underline}** In sum, official war stories not only camouflage
political agendas but also suppress critical thinking about
institutionalized racism, sexism, classism, and homophobia. By obscuring
the reciprocal constitution of valorized masculinity and vilified
femininity these stories avoid critique of gender itself, with the
effect of reproducing multiple forms of subjection and violence. My
\"thinking through\" intersectionality tells a different story. It too
is limited by its perspective, commitments, erasures, and
generalizations. Framed by triad analytics, [**[my story casts emotional
commitments, cultural productions, and material practices as mutually
constitutive]{.underline}**.]{.mark} **[It foregrounds investments in
gendered identities and gender ideologies not to privilege them but to
explore how militarism and war-making depend on them]{.underline}**.
**[[I do not claim that mine is the \"superior\" story though I believe
it is an urgent one.]{.mark}]{.underline}** I do claim that gender
matters, and especially for \"thinking through\" militarism and war.
More pointedly, I am arguing that **[[we can neither adequately analyze
violence, nor effectively advance intersectional analyses, if we ignore
how feminization devalorizes]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

#### Emerging technology is only meant to bolster Hegemony. That increases the likelihood of conflict, and justifies sustained structural violence that outweighs the small risk of great power war. The US and the "enemy" will strut their nuclear arsenal until violence finally occurs and collapses humanity.

Security edited by Sjoberg, p. 90-93 - spp)

Feminist evaluations of power transition hypotheses A feminist analysis
of PTT needs to reformulate the PTT hypotheses. This section applies the
feminist critiques of the mechanism (power), the object (great states),
and the variables (power parity and dissatisfaction) that PTT uses to
explain international conflict to the reformulation of the major PTT
hypotheses. It posits alternative explanations and alternative possible
solutions and futures (Table 5.1). Relative position, state hegemonic
masculinity, and bellicosity: [Power transition theorists found that
\"[occupation of a high position in the international hierarchy is
associated with war involvement]{.mark}, irrespective of other
attributes]{.underline} (ideology, etc.) of the state occupying that
position. \"88 Even if [those states at the top of the international
hierarchy are more likely to be involved in wars]{.underline}, 89
feminists question the assumption that this is because nations with the
capacity to fight wars are necessarily more likely to fight. [Feminist
reformulation]{.underline} (R1) (see Table 5.1) [posits that [the
content and salience of a state\'s hegemonic masculinity will be a
factor in its bellicosity]{.mark}.]{.underline} The feminist argument is
that [the more competitive a state\'s hegemonic masculinity, the more
likely that state is to make war]{.underline}; this risk is compounded
by high salience. [In World War II Germany, a competitive form of
masculinity was very salient.]{.underline} George Mosse\'s study of the
ideal German man90 in the 1930s reveals him as: Tall and muscular, he
has no fat on his body and no hair anywhere but on his head. His broad,
contoured shoulders narrow to a thin waist. He has a fine colorless
chiseled face with a strong prominent square jaw. He is the flawless man
. . . , not only did he embody the older aristocratic vlues of bravery,
courage, and chivarly, but mirroring bourgeois values, he was also
disciplined, orderly, and restrained \... The perfect man, therefore,
was committed to sacrifice and heroism, in other words, soldierly values
that put the nation ahead of the individual.91 This German masculinity
\"increasingly came to be linked to ideas about nationalism.\"92 [This
idea of masculinity became increasingly salient as \"the nationalist
press often portrayed Jewish men as the exact opposite of the manly
ideal in looks and behavior]{.underline} \... jittery, restless, greedy,
selfish, and \... ugly-nearly deformed.\"93 In the 1930s, \"German
fascists \... took the notion of masculinity to its awful, ghastly, and
seemingly logical extreme.\"94 Perhaps this can be contrasted with the
case of a rising China. Kam Louie, a scholar of Chinese masculinities,
explains\' that while "Western stereotypes of the \'real man\' have
described the Occidental male as forming his notion of male-self within
images of toughness, courageousness, and decisiveness, \... in the
Chinese case, the cerebral male model tends to dominate the macho,
brawny male.\"95 The Communist Revolution in China has further
demilitarized Chinese masculinity, since, while \"the core meaning of
wen-wu still revolves around cultural attainment and martial valour \...
\[ideal-types of masculinity have been shaped by\] Communist insistence
that able-bodied citizens work \[which\] \... has generated idealized
images of workers and peasants\" rather than soldiers98 Louie suggests
that the current Chinese hegemonic masculinity is less aggressive and
militaristic, and that it is both more open and less salient now than it
has been previously.99 Given these two examples, the feminist
reformulation (R 1) would expect bellicosity from 1930s Germany rather
than contemporary China. The same empirical evidence that PTT uses could
instead support a feminist argument that Germany\'s level of interest in
aggressive masculinity made Germany a belligerent state, and that a
dissatisfied China would have less interest in war than the 1930s
Germany. A feminist reinterpretation would expect that Germans'
hypercompetitive hegemonic masculinity in the 1930s would motivate
German leaders and citizens to try to subordinate other masculinities,
while the Chinese government, following their more cerebral hegemonic
masculinity, would place less priority on competition with other
states.\\ Hegemony and Peace: [PTT claims that the greater and more
stable the concentration of power, the more peaceful that system will
be. [PIT associates peace with the absence of armed conflict between
great powers]{.mark}.]{.underline} As such[, [the world can still be
\"at peace\" if dozens of civil wars are going on in countries outside
of the class of \"great powers.\"]{.underline} Th]{.mark}e
dominant/challenger dichotomy means that [[PTT]{.mark} [ignores all but
the most powerful states]{.mark}]{.underline}. Instead of limiting the
discourse on security to the concerns of the dominant global power and
the (few or even only one) challenger(s), [feminists pay attention to
the entire global political community. The [PTT]{.mark} understanding of
\"[peace]{.mark}\" [obscures]{.mark} terrible [atrocities]{.mark}
[and]{.mark} [conceals]{.mark} a crucial and [contradictory effect of
the concentration of power]{.mark} in the international
arena]{.underline}. Feminist work has consistently shown that,
[[as]{.mark} [the powerful wield more power]{.mark}, [the weak feel more
pressure.]{.mark} This pressure is [manifested]{.mark} not only
[in]{.mark} the form of [interstate war,]{.mark} but also in [civil war
and structural violence]{.mark}.]{.underline} Feminists\' interrogation
of state centrism suggests that [lack of war between great states does
not automatically create peace within them, and that the marginalized
citizens of great states should be a topic of concern in global
politics]{.underline}. Feminists\' interest in gender subordination
shows that [women\'s security and their lives are constantly at
risk.]{.underline} As such, the feminist reformulation (R2) predicts
that [concentrated power is a net negative, empirically, normatively,
and epistemologically. Empirically, it is likely to increase
international conflicts and internal unrest outside of the center of
power, and to draw attention away from the world\'s worst humanitarian
disasters.]{.underline} As Ann Tickner notes, [[much]{.mark} of the
[violence]{.mark} in the world [is outside of great power
war]{.mark}]{.underline} and, as theorists, \"[we in the west can no
longer afford to privilege a tradition of scholarship that focuses on
the concerns and ambitions of great powers.\" Feminists reject the
dominance of the strong over the weak as a mechanism of control in favor
of empathy and connectedness]{.underline}. Epistemologically, feminists
note different social experience produces different knowledges[. A
theory of international security that excludes most people also leaves
out important knowledge. An empathetic approach might increase the
inclusiveness of knowledge about global politics. These insights mean
that [a feminist perspective would draw attention to the security of the
people on the margins rather than focusing on an improbable conflict
between the US and China]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Feminist
insights suggest it is important to recognize that [in a world where the
US and China compete for dominance, more than four billion other people
neither compete nor dominate]{.underline}. Decisions made by states with
the preponderance of power-over reverberate around the world. If the US
and China decided to fight a nuclear war, their decision would be felt
around the world. Even less severe decisions by powerful states have
wide-ranging impacts on individuals\' lives. For example, the US
government's decision to condition continued military presence in South
Korea on mandatory STD testing in Korean prostitution villages impacted
the social and economic dynamic between Korean prostitutes.
[[Neither]{.mark} the [US]{.mark} [nor China]{.mark} [provides]{.mark}
its poorest citizens [adequate]{.mark} humanitarian [aid]{.mark} to
avoid death from starvation or preventable disease. [Yet]{.mark} the US
and China [are]{.mark} [the two biggest military spenders]{.mark} in the
world]{.underline}. In real terms, [the [most marginalized]{.mark}
citizens of each nation [lose]{.mark} [when]{.mark} [strategic posturing
inspires them to focus on military readiness]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Feminists have documented how [militarization]{.underline} of women\'s
lives [decreases freedoms and changes economic and social]{.underline}
patterns.109 Because of the these threats, [feminists problematize the
assumption that entities called the US and China legitimately merit more
consideration than the most marginal citizens within those states or the
citizens of states that their dominance subordinates.]{.underline}

#### Thus, we advocate for vulnerability. Only a recognition and embodiment of vulnerability can reshape the manner in which we approach IR and foreign policy that does not replicate the hierarchical logic of the protection racket that dooms us to extinction. Vulnerability gives agency to the oppressed bodies -- which allows for the destruction of hierarchal patriotism. 

**Väyrynen, 2019** (Tarja Väyrynen is a professor of Peace and Conflict
Research and a director of Tampere Peace Research Institute (TAPRI). Her
research interests include conflict resolution and peacebuilding,
feminist theory and post-colonial theory. "Mundane peace and the
politics of vulnerability: a nonsolid feminist research agenda,"
*Peacebuilding*, 7:2, 146-159, SPP)

As outlined above, early feminist peace and conflict researchers, such
as Elise Boulding and Sara Ruddick, insisted on the importance of the
relational body when studying peace. I also argued above that local turn
scholarship is limited in its understanding of the everyday and mundane
practices of peace. In my view, b[oth the relational body and mundane
practices require a more nuanced reading of power, governance and the
vulnerabilities that practices of power produce, since the body is
always both 'active and acted upon]{.underline}'.35 In short, practices
of governance that are targeted at the body also produce the body.36 Yet
the fleshy living body also has agency, which makes it an 'engaged
body-subject'.37 In other words, the body is never a passive target of
practices of governance: it also has a capacity to escape these
practices.38 Eighty-year-old Kaisu told her story in a Finnish
documentary film in 2010.39 She was among the Finnish women accused of
having fraternised with German soldiers during the Second World War. She
moved to Germany with the withdrawing German troops and was repatriated
to Finland after the war. The following is my description of Kaisu's
narrative: VIGNETTE 2 Kaisu was among the women whose bodies were
securitised and transferred to the camp immediately on their arrival on
the Finnish soil. She calls it the 'quarantine camp' as if there had
been something contagious in her body that needed purification. Hence
medicalisation also takes hold of her body even in her most intimate
memories. Her young body had been securitised and medicalised as it was
seen to constitute the contagious risk of knowing too much. In the
documentary, her body is stiff, but strong when she sits on the porch of
the barracks, in which she thinks she was incarcerated sixty years ago.
She is smoking a cigarette with a firm hand. Her body and her solemn
voice convey her strength. Kaisu recalls how the Security Police had
suspected her of being a German mole. She is very proud of the fact that
she did not cry during the interrogations: 'In front of Hautojärvi \[the
interrogation officer\] I did not cry'. In the narrative, her resistance
is not just geared towards the interrogation officer, but also towards
the Finnish state, whose security apparatus suspected and humiliated
her. In her upright body, she resists the forces that sought to silence
her.40 [When considering mundane peace, Judith Butler's observation that
one way of [managing populations is to distribute vulnerability among
people unequally]{.mark} is crucial]{.underline}.41
[Biopower]{.underline} -- power that is about managing the births,
deaths, reproduction and illnesses of a population and which is
ultimately utilised by the state ostensibly in the protection of life --
[establishes [a norm]{.mark} that [allows for]{.mark} measurement,
[evaluation and hierarchical ranking]{.mark}. As such, it constitutes a
mechanism of control and distributes vulnerability and invulnerability
among the population]{.underline}.42 In Kaisu's case, her body was
rendered vulnerable -- shaped as that of an outcast -- through the
mechanisms of governance in the post-war Finnish national order. The
vignette demonstrates that [power is multiple and relational, as it
establishes socio-historical relationships that render some bodies more
vulnerable than others. Biopower increases efficiency and capacity at
the level of individual bodies and whole populations, yet it also
distributes vulnerability and invulnerability. This is particularly
acute during times of economic, social and political transformation,
such as peacebuilding and reconstruction, when social relations must be
re-imagined and re-structured.]{.underline} Butler theorises peace and
argues that [peace is a way of indicating one's dependency on others and
being acknowledged. She not only theorises peace as individual
vulnerability but says that it needs to be
institutionalised]{.underline}: [I think that [peace is the active and
difficult resistance to the temptation of war]{.mark}]{.underline}; it
is the prerogative and the obligation of the injured. Peace is something
that has to be vigilantly maintained; i[t is a vigilance, and it
involves temptation, and [it does not mean]{.mark} we as [human
beings]{.mark} [are not aggressive]{.mark}. It does [not mean that we do
not have murderous impulses]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is a mistaken way
of understanding non-violence. . . . [Peace is a certain resistance to
the terrible satisfactions of war. It's a [commitment to living with a
certain kind of vulnerability to others and susceptibility to being
wounded that actually gives our individual lives meaning]{.mark}. . . I
think it needs to be institutionalised. It needs to be part of a
community ethos. I think in fact it needs to be part of an entire
foreign policy]{.underline}.43 For Butler, therefore[, the [recognition
of vulnerability can lead to more adequate, peaceful responses to
different forms of violence and can counter the tendency to react to
violence with more violence]{.mark}]{.underline}.44 Alyson Cole has
noted that Butler's view on vulnerability paves the way to 'nonviolent
interaffectivity'.45 [[Vulnerability]{.underline}]{.mark} does not, in
this view, imply weakness or inferiority; rather, it [[is a human
condition,]{.mark} 'a basic kind of openness to being [affected and
affecting in both positive and negative ways,]{.mark} which can take
diverse forms in different social situations]{.underline} (for example,
bodily, psychological, economic, emotional, and legal vulnerabilities)',
as Erin Gilson summarises Butler's views.46 Understanding oneself as
vulnerable involves an understanding of the self as shaped by its
relationships to others, the world, power and its environs. [This has,
in my view, implications for the everyday, as our [embodiment and
vulnerability are embedded in the everyday]{.mark} -- in its
historicity, forms of power, materiality and concreteness. Vulnerability
is not just a way of referring to the capacity to be wounded, however.
It is also a 'way of indicating one's dependency on another, a set of
institutions, or a circumambient world to be well, to be safe, to be
acknowledged]{.underline}', argues Butler, in the spirit of early
feminist peace and conflict researchers' work.47 While the vulnerable
body is often thought to be private and non-political, when in contact
with other bodies, the politics of vulnerability comes to the fore --
firstly, in the form of the unequal distribution of vulnerabilities, and
secondly, in the form of accountability, recognition and
acknowledgement. In other words, [[the way in which vulnerability is
recognised]{.mark}, accounted for, acknowledged and responded [to is at
the core of the political. 'The political' is]{.mark} hence [an
existential relation that we all live out, on a daily basis, in ways
that create, re-produce, transcend and challenge differences,
hierarchies, discriminations and vulnerabilities]{.mark} between
subjectivities and political positions]{.underline}. Furthermore,
[[vulnerable bodies are agentic,]{.mark} as receptivity, accountability
and vulnerability are actually the presuppositions of agency, not its
opposites]{.underline}.48 In short, vulnerability is enabling for our
being in the world; that is, [[vulnerability is a 'condition of
potential that makes possible other conditions', including
peace]{.underline}]{.mark}. It can be argued that Kaisu's bold
appearance in the documentary film was a political event of claiming
back her silenced body and evoking recognition of the existence of the
bodies of her kind. Her vulnerable body thereby carried an agentic
capacity capable of challenging the existing hierarchies,
discriminations and differences. Although vulnerability can be seen as a
shared human condition, it is lived and experienced in different ways,
as well as distributed unequally, as argued above. [The ways in which we
live and are affected can be understood only in light of the
particularity of embodied, social and mundane experiences. It is in this
way that [feminist and critical theorising of the body, the everyday and
vulnerability open up new pathways to re-theorise peace.]{.mark} Peace
is something that becomes expressed and takes place through acts and
points of everyday contact between variously situated and variously
vulnerable bodies -- namely, in corporeal events where accountability,
response-ability, recognition and acknowledgement emerge]{.underline}.
The pluralistic and critical approaches indicated in my agenda are more
sensitive to the changing patterns and dynamics of peace than many
abstract, ontologically solid or violence-dependent approaches.

#### Our method of embodied politics is what sets the Framework for the topic and the debates that are to be had. WE control the fairness debate and the ground debate -- The World of IR determines if ground is valuable or if it is not; this is why Afghanistan was fought to save the women from the men and costed several thousands of lives.

[[In (neo)liberal political discourses, the ideal subject]{.mark} is an
independent *homo oeconomicus,* that [is, a masculine, disembodied
being, who is self-sufficient and self-caring, while knowingly making
rational, utilitarian, and abstracted ethical choices for the common
good]{.mark}]{.underline} of all. The liberal subject is an invulnerable
individual, or at least well secured against any risks in life. He is
never ill; he does not leak of bodily fluids (because he seems not to
have a body); and he never ages. Or, in case he does age, he does so
actively and "successfully", in ways that his body's care needs would
never gain control of *his* life: the life of a subjective, rational
Self. Feminist social and political theory argues that these conceptions
of political subjectivity are non-realistic: [[Such disembodied subjects
simply do not exist]{.underline}]{.mark} (cf. Bacchi and Beasley 2002;
Beattie and Schick 2013; Cohn 2014; Fineman 2008; Grosz 1994; Hoppania
and Vaittinen 2015; Robinson 1999; 2011; Ruddick 1990; Shildrick 2002;
2012; Tronto 1993; Vaittinen 2015; forthcoming) [[While vulnerable
embodiment is discursively associated merely with women, children, and
the weak, the truth is that as human beings we all *are* bodies, and as
such vulnerable, relational and dependent]{.underline}]{.mark}. As
political subjects we are perhaps meant to "own" our bodies, to be in
control of them and our lives. Yet, the bodies that our subjectivity
inhabits may in fact both pre-exist and outlive the subjective "I". [We
are intercorporeal: conceived, born, raised, and sustained by other
bodies.]{.underline} We live \_and die \_in concrete relations with
others[. Thus, [as opposed to being the self-caring ideal subjects of
(neo)liberal politics, as bodies we are dependent, fleshy, and
irrational. We are vulnerable, sometimes sick and
dis/abled]{.mark}]{.underline}, every day in contact with our own bodily
fluids  \_and frequently also with those of others. We are made of and
sometimes governed by the fluids, bacteria and hormones that move
within, without, and between our bodies (cf. Fishel 2015; Irni 2013;
Preciado 2013). [[Our lives are inherently frail. We start ageing and
decaying the moment we are born]{.mark}.]{.underline} In other words[,
[the fact of embodiment makes the liberal understanding of subjectivity
ultimately an illusion]{.underline}]{.mark}[. Nevertheless, global
politics and its [security policies]{.mark} and practices [continue to
build on the liberal conceptions of life]{.mark}. In other words, the
contemporary security policies and practices tend [to build on an
illusion]{.mark}]{.underline}. In this chapter, I challenge these
illusionary yet prevailing understandings of security through different
accounts of embodied in/security. I begin the chapter with a discussion
of feminist analysis of vulnerability. Here, I rely on accounts that
emerge from the feminist ethics of care tradition (e.g. Robinson 1999;
2011), as well as Carol Cohn's (2014) recent interrogation of
vulnerability in international security discourses. [Feminist
conceptions of [vulnerability and care challenge conventional security
practice]{.mark}s, and reveal them as unrealistic, [by foregrounding the
human beings' existential dependency on each other for
surviva]{.mark}l]{.underline} (e.g. Robinson 2011; Beattie and Schick
2013; Butler 2004). Yet, as I have argued elsewhere (Vaittinen 2015),
they also rarely explicitly engage with the body organism and its
materiality, which need be recognised if embodied in/security is to be
taken seriously. In this chapter, I interrogate the body in more
concrete terms. Here, I first show how embodied realities of human life
have always been central in feminist security studies, albeit usually in
contexts of direct violence and hence in/securities external to the
body. I then introduce the concept of the lowest common denominator of
embodiment, which emphasises the body's need of care from other bodies
and, while defying essentialism, is applicable to all living bodies at
all times (Vaittinen, forthcoming). Unlike in the usual security frames
that begin with direct violence, in this conception, embodied
in/security becomes defined through to the body's most basic needs,
which necessitate care relations with other bodies at times when we are
corporeally incapable of being the liberal individual subjects that we
are meant to be. In the concluding section[, [I juxtapose my conception
of embodied in/security with the]{.mark} conceptions that seem to
predominate [security discourses]{.mark} more generally. I argue
[that]{.mark}, sometimes also in feminist security studies, the
empirical contexts of direct violence, war, and militarism easily
([re)produce perceptions of embodied in/security that begin with the
threats that bodies pose to other bodies. Here, in/secure bodies are
primarily present as subjects and objects of violence, rather than as
caring and in need of care]{.mark}. Consequently, [the threats that the
body, as an organism, poses to itself remain unaddressed.]{.mark} I
argue that ultimately at stake here are two contending gendered
ontologies of human relatedness through which security policies can be
shaped: feminised dependency on other bodies' care against masculine
perceptions of the bodies of others as primarily threatening. Both the
conceptions of embodied in/vulnerability are profoundly relational, yet
the security practices that they (re)produce are fundamentally
different.]{.underline} Existential vulnerability and the ethics of care
[[Feminist literature]{.underline}]{.mark} (e.g. Fineman 2008; Beattie
and Schick 2013) [[has emphasised the necessity to put vulnerability
instead of liberal individualism at the centre of political discourses
and practices]{.mark}, since vulnerability describes the condition of
human life much more realistically than individual, rational autonomy
does. This way of thinking is particularly present in [the feminist
ethics of care tradition,]{.mark} which [provides a powerful alternative
to liberal individualistic thinking about ethics, morality, and
politics]{.mark}. Foregrounding the existential dependency of every
human being on each other's care for survival, feminist accounts [of
care can also forcefully challenge the conventional security thinking,
by presenting the lack of care as a threat to human
security]{.mark}]{.underline} (Robinson 2011). [Feminist ethics of care
argues that practices of care give rise to an alternative moral
thinking, which is capable of realistically accounting for the
situatedness of the moral subject]{.underline} (see, for example, Tronto
1993; Robinson 1999; 2011; Ruddick 1990). Feminist care ethicists show
how moral decisions are never made in a political void or behind a 'veil
of ignorance', as in the Kantian tradition, but in concrete relations
with particular others. Importantly, emphasising practices of care as a
source of moral and political relatedness, [feminist ethics of care
demonstrates how human existential vulnerability - that is, our
dependency on care as well as our capacity to respond caringly - is a
powerful site and source of politics rather than a realm external to
it]{.underline} (Tronto 1993; Robinson 1999; 2011; Vaittinen 2015).

#### **Revisionism, either ontological or epistemological, essential to disrupting toxic masculinity in IR -- vulnerability is a prerequisite to any ethical FIAT in the international arena, we lay the foundation for ethical policy debates.** 

**Youngs 04 (Gillian, Professor of Digital Economy at the University of
Brighton, Feminist International Relations: a contradiction in terms?
Or: why women and gender are essential to understanding the world 'we'
live in\*, International Affairs, 80, pgs 77-80, JKS)**

This discussion will demonstrate, in the ways outlined above, the depth
and range of feminist perspectives on power---a prime concern of
International Relations and indeed of the whole study of politics. It
will illustrate the varied ways in which scholars using these
perspectives study power in relation to gender, a nexus largely
disregarded in mainstream approaches. From feminist positions, [this
lacuna marks out mainstream analyses as trapped in a narrow and
superficial ontological and epistemological framework. [A major part of
the problem is the way in which the mainstream takes the appearance of a
pre- dominantly male-constructed reality as a given, and]{.mark} [thus
as the beginning and end]{.mark} of investigation and
knowledge-building. [**Feminism requires an ontological revisionism: a
recognition that it is necessary to go behind the appearance and examine
how differentiated and gendered power constructs** the **social
relations that form that reality**]{.mark}]{.underline}. ¶ While it may
be empirically accurate to observe that historically and
contemporaneously men have dominated the realms of international
politics and ¶ economics, [feminists argue that a full understanding of
the nature of those realms must include understanding the intricate
patterns of (gendered) inequalities that shape them.]{.underline}
[[Mainstream I]{.mark}nternational [R]{.mark}elations]{.underline}, in
accepting that because these realms appear to be predominantly man-made,
there is no reason to ask how or why that is the case, [[stop short of
taking account of gender.]{.mark} As long as those who adhere to this
position continue to accept the sufficiency of the]{.underline}
appearances and probe no further[, [then the ontological and
epistemological limitations will continue to be reproduced]{.mark}.
¶]{.underline} Early work in feminist International Relations in the
1980s had to address this problem directly by peeling back the
masculinist surface of world politics to reveal its more complex
gendered (and racialized) dynamics. Key scholars such as Cynthia Enloe
focused on core International Relations issues of war, militarism and
security, highlighting the dependence of these concepts on gender
structures---e.g. dominant forms of the masculine (warrior) subject as
protector/conqueror/exploiter of the feminine/feminized
object/other---and thus the fundamental importance of subjecting them to
gender analysis. In a series of works, including the early Bananas,
beaches and bases: making feminist sense of international politics
(1989), Enloe has addressed different aspects of the most overtly
masculine realms of international relations, conflict and defence, to
reveal their deeper gendered realities.3 This body of work has launched
a powerful critique of the taboo that made women and gender most
invisible, in theory and practice, where masculinity had its most
extreme, defining (and violent) expression. Enloe's research has
provided one of the most comprehensive bodies of evidence for the
ontological revisionism required of mainstream International Relations,
especially in relation to its core concerns. ¶ When Enloe claimed that
'gender makes the world go round',4 she was in fact turning the abstract
logic of malestream International Relations inside out. This abstract
logic saw little need to take theoretical and analytical account of
gender as a social force because in practical terms only one gender, the
male, appeared to define International Relations. Ann Tickner has
recently offered the reminder that this situation persists: 'During the
1990s, women were admitted to most combat positions in the U.S.
military, and the U.S. president appointed ¶ the first female secretary
of state, but occupations in foreign and military policy- making in most
states remain overwhelmingly male, and usually elite male.'5 ¶ Nearly a
decade earlier, in her groundbreaking work Gender in International
Relations: feminist perspectives on achieving global security,6 she had
asked the kinds of questions that were foundational to early feminist
International Relations: '[Why is the subject matter of my discipline so
distant from women's lived experiences? Why have women been conspicuous
only by their absence in the worlds of diplomacy and military and
foreign policy-making?]{.underline}' Tickner, like Enloe, has
interrogated core issues in mainstream International Relations, such as
security and peace, providing feminist bases for gendered understanding
of issues that have defined it. Her reflection on what has happened
since Gender in International Relations was published indicates the
prominence of tensions between theory and practice. 'We may have
provided some answers to my questions as to why IR and foreign
policymaking remain male-dominated; but breaking down the unequal gender
hierarchies that perpetuate these androcentric biases remains a
challenge.'7 [¶ The persistence of the overriding maleness of
international relations in practice is part of the reason for the
continued resistance and lack of responsiveness to the analytical
relevance feminist International Relations claims]{.underline}. In other
words, it is to some extent not surprising that feminist International
Relations stands largely outside mainstream International Relations,
because the concerns of the former, [gender and women, continue to
appear to be subsidiary to high politics and diplomacy.]{.underline} One
has only to recall the limited attention to gender and women in the
recent Afghanistan and Iraq crises to illustrate this point.8 So how
have feminists tackled this problem? Necessarily, but problematically,
by calling for a deeper level of ontological revisionism. I say
problematically because, bearing in mind the limited success of the
first kind discussed above, it can be anticipated that this deeper kind
is likely to be even more challeng- ing for those in the mainstream
camp. ¶ [[The second level of ontological revisionism required relates
to critical understanding of why the appearance of international
relations as predominantly a sphere of male influence and action
continues to seem unproblematic from mainstream
perspectives.]{.underline} **[This entails investigating masculinity
itself: the nature of its subject
position]{.underline}**]{.mark}---including [[as reflected in the
collective realm of politics--- and]{.mark}]{.underline} the frameworks
and [[hierarchies that structure its social relations,]{.mark} not only
[in relation to women but also]{.mark} in relation to [men configured as
(feminized) 'others']{.mark}]{.underline} ¶ because of racial, colonial
and other factors, including sexuality. Marysia Zalewski and Jane
Parpart directly captured such an approach as 'the "man" question in
international relations'.9 I would like to suggest that for those
sceptical about feminist International Relations, Zalewski's
introductory chapter, 'From the "woman" question to the "man" question
in International Relations', offers an impressively transparent way in
to its substantive terrain.10 Reflecting critically on the editors'
learning process in preparing the volume and working with its
contributors, both men and women, Zalewski discusses the various
modifications through which the title of the work had moved. These
included at different stages the terms 'women', 'masculinity' and
'feminism', finally ending with 'the "man" question'---signalling once
again, I suggest, tensions between theory and practice, the difficulty
of escaping the concrete dominance of the male subject position in the
realm of international relations. ¶ The project's starting point
revealed a faith in the modernist commitment to the political importance
of bringing women into the position of subjecthood. We implicitly
accepted that women's subjecthood could be exposed and revealed in the
study and practice of international relations, hoping that this would
also reveal the nature of male dominance and power. [Posing the 'man'
question instead reflects our diminishing belief that the exclusion of
women can be remedied by converting them into subjects]{.underline}.11 ¶
**[Adding women appeared to have failed to 'destabilize' the
field;]{.underline}** so perhaps **[critically addressing its prime
subject 'man' head-on could help to do so.]{.underline}** ['[This leads
us to ask questions about the roles of masculinity in the conduct of
international relations and to question the accepted naturalness of the
abundance of men in the theory and practice of international
relations']{.mark}]{.underline} (emphasis added).12 ¶ The deeper level
of **[[ontological revisionism]{.underline}]{.mark}** called for by
feminist Inter- national Relations in this regard is as follows. Not
only does it [**press beyond the appearance of international relations
as a predominantly masculine terrain by including women in its analysis,
it [goes further to question the predominant masculinity itself and the
accepted naturalness of its power and influence in collective]{.mark}**
(most significantly [state) **and individual
forms.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### **The resolution relies on the creation of fake scenarios to try and "strut their stuff" rely on the creation of a crisis which requires a masculine hero to urgently address the impact -- results in the creation of self-fulfilling prophecies that will result in serial policy failure that does more destruction than is helps. Emerging tech relies within the realm of fantasy -- reject it, as it pushes feminist criticism to the periphery** 

**Griffin, 2015**. (Penny, Senior Lecturer in International Relations at
the University of New South Wales, Australia. "crisis, austerity and
gendered governance: a feminist perspective," in *feminist review* 109:
49-72, spp)

While globally it seems that 'we are more or less permanently suspended
in states of crisis' (Otto, 2011: 76), [crucially for feminist analyses,
accounts that abstract moments of crisis as 'exceptional' events
dislocate crisis from the nuanced thinking that would challenge the
extreme measures that distort human rights and welfare]{.underline}
(such as austerity measures and welfare cuts). [[Crises]{.mark} embody
the power to shape our conceptions of world politics but also,
crucially, have the capacity to construct and govern our most intimate
and everyday practices. They [are significant mechanisms of everyday,
contemporary governance because they generate discourses of 'emergency',
'speedy diagnosis' and 'robust response', authorising 'the operation of
a more hegemonic legal order' and reducing]{.mark}]{.underline} (but not
eliminating) '[[the space for political contestation and
critique]{.underline}']{.mark} (ibid.: 80). [An alternative way of
reading 'crisis']{.underline} (and not something governance mechanisms
and actors are likely to countenance) [is]{.underline}, however, [to
concentrate on its fictive content, with 'the crisis' understood as a
fictive imagining of everyday events that serves particular discursive
purposes]{.underline}. Found in media and official portrayals that have
represented the crisis in terms of shock, devastation, anxiety, fear,
anger and shame (see, e.g., Widmaier, 2010), [the neo-liberal governance
of crisis has relied intensively on [the language of trauma to generate
'urgent']{.mark}, wide-ranging but surreptitious social [reforms,
including the rewriting of institutional power arrangements and the
dismantling of]{.mark} protective [welfare systems. The reproduction of
tropes of urgency, immediacy and muscularity]{.mark} (what we might call
neo-liberalism's 'conventional' responses to crisis), mobilised through
metaphors of catastrophe and disaster, [has,]{.mark} in particular,
[allowed for 'a set of otherwise controversial "responses" to receive
widespread legitimation']{.mark}]{.underline} (Brassett and Clarke,
2012: 5). The extent to which financial risk management has been cast
over the course of the twentieth century as 'a domain of technical
expertise', removed from public debate and placed firmly in the hands of
an elite cadre of fiscal 'experts' (De Goede, 2004: 200--207), has
rendered such decisive interventions yet more realisable. Despite
interesting, and critical, engagements with the use of visuality and
metaphor in dominant representations of the crisis, how [the use of
visual and narrative metaphors of enormity, shock and devastation, and
the ensuing repetition of the need for robust, or 'muscular',
interventions, has been gendered]{.underline} has been little discussed.
Key financial publications, including, for example, The Financial Times,
The Economist and Time magazine, have regularly deployed
representational practices that discriminate actively and often between
identifi- able and sexed bodies as symbolic of economic success,
regulation and recovery in the global political economy. [[Men
appear]{.mark}]{.underline} across these publications in power,
[[holding the power, bearing the burden of responsibility for crisis and
resolving crisis, reaffirming the]{.underline}]{.mark} meaning of the
global financial system and its practices as [[symbolic of white,
masculine corporate power]{.underline}]{.mark} (Griffin, 2015). This is
particularly important with regard to feminism's attention to governance
in its everyday forms and practices, since, by immersing the financial
crisis in images of masculinity, popular and policy sources provide a
subtle, but thoroughly gendered, grounding for the ideas, methods and
practices instituted by instruments of governance in response to the
crisis (such as the measures of austerity considered below). The below
analysis thus considers how, [as everyday practices of global
governance, '[crisis management' techniques have reproduced the
dismissal of ill-fitting feminist critique and co-opted more sympathetic
feminist knowledges]{.mark}.]{.underline} This, the paper argues, simply
confirms the longevity of neo-liberal, capitalist, imperatives in the
global political economy, entrenching the power of existing economic
orders and constraining the possibilities, and space, for contestation
and critique based on the masculinised reproduction of financial
privilege. crisis governance discourse (1): the dismissal of feminism
and the social costs of austerity\[:\] One way to read feminism's
position vis-a\`-vis crisis is to note the damaging blow that
contemporary governance reactions to 'crisis' have dealt feminism.
[Crises everywhere 'are a particularly dangerous time for feminism, and
indeed for all progressive ways of thinking]{.underline}' (Otto, 2011:
78). [The '[emergency']{.mark} measures [initiated by the announcement
of 'crisis']{.mark} represent a sh[ift in power away from inclusive law
and policy-making towards so-called 'expertise']{.mark} in '[crisis
management', 'muscular' law-making and the entrenchment of executive
power]{.mark}, all of which effectively [push feminism 'off the
map']{.mark}]{.underline} (ibid.: 76--79). Governments in the developed
and developing world have further entrenched [the reactionary, 'hard'
law politics of crisis management, using the rhetoric of urgency to
adopt far-reaching and increasingly invasive crisis management
measures.]{.underline} Under the guise of 'austerity', the IMF has even
been recalibrated as an institution of worldly fiscal expertise, a
notable departure from the derided figure of cookie-cutter policy-making
it struck in the aftermath of the Asian and Argentinean financial
crises.

#### Vulnerability is not a weakness, a passing indisposition, or something we can arrange to do without, vulnerability is not a choice, vulnerability is the underlying, ever present and abiding undercurrent of our natural state. To run from vulnerability is to run from the essence of our nature, the attempt to be invulnerable is the vain attempt to become something we are not and most especially, to close off our understanding of the grief of others. More seriously, in refusing our vulnerability we refuse the help needed at every turn of our existence and immobilize the essential, tidal and conversational foundations of our identity. [^1] 

**Vulnerability in the status quo is gendered. It is assigned unequally
as a means of establishing power hierarchies. Masculinity is strong,
dominant, and invulnerable, while femininity is weak, subordinate, and
vulnerable. Vulnerability is especially evident as it applies to
security and masculine Nation States attempting to secure feminized
"Others."**

**Vaittinen, 2018** (Tiina, Academy of Finland Postdoctoral Research

chapter published in Carol Gentry, Laura J. Shepherd & Laura Sjoberg
(eds.) Routledge Handbook in Gender and Security, SPP)

For Cohn (2014, 53) "the most important piece of the puzzle" is "the
ways in which [[vulnerability is intensely gendered at the symbolic
level]{.mark}". This is particularly so [in the predominant
international security theory and practice, where human vulnerability is
perceived as a matter of "vulnerable groups" only and thus "displaced
onto a subset of humans"]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Drawing on her
empirical [work at the UN Security Council]{.underline} (SC) as an
observer of discussions on the SC Resolution 1325 on Women Peace and
Security, Cohn demonstrates that [vulnerability is frequently
discussed]{.underline} at the SC, [yet always with a reference to some
Others]{.underline}. In these discussions, [vulnerability is never
attached to those responsible for gendered security practices. The
same]{.underline}, of course, [applies to much of liberal politics
today, where [decision makers and state officials are presumed to be
invulnerable, rational minds]{.mark}. In security
practices]{.underline}, however, [[the implications of such othering are
far-reaching, since they fundamentally shape our gendered understandings
of whose in/security is recognised and
recognisable.]{.mark}]{.underline} First, [[not only is the concept of
'vulnerable groups' deeply gendered in practices of security, but it is
also *heteronormatively* gendered to apply to (cis)women, who are
inherently connected to the infantilised mass of
womenandchildren-and-thedisabledrest]{.mark}.]{.underline} [This shows
in the framework of]{.underline} UNSCR 1325 (Cohn 2014, 61), but also in
the [racialised development agendas]{.underline} in the Global South,
where campaigns to invest in a girl for women's financial empowerment
are promoted as projects of global justice, even if they may in fact
commodify women's (re)productive bodies for the expansion of neoliberal
capitalism (Wilson 2011; Roberts 2015). Such [limited conceptions of
gendered vulnerability]{.underline} also direct [research and activism,
as politically motivated funding instruments often require that
researchers and NGOs focus their activities on 'vulnerable groups' that
are explicitly defined as womenandchildren (and the disabled
rest).]{.underline} Furthermore, [[when vulnerability is allowed for
some but not others, only certain kinds of bodies' vulnerability *makes
sense*.]{.underline}]{.mark} Consequently, [those who *cannot* --
because of their sexed and racialised bodies for instance -- appear as
vulnerable in the predominant security discourses, seem suspicious and
emerge as a threat. [The wrong kind of vulnerable bodies appear as
incomprehensible, and the ethical responsibility to secure needs of
these "other others" becomes blurred and denied]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Ahmed 2010; see also Ahmed 2004). Here, the recent European political
representations of young refugee men make a conspicuous example.
Especially in the social media, but often also in the yellow press, male
refugees are recurrently portrayed as terrorists' and lazy aliens, who
forge asylum claims and come after a better social security instead of
staying in the conflict-zones to defend 'their' womenandchildren at
home. Simultaneously, they are represented as sexual predators and
pathological rapists, and hence a threat to 'our' womenandgirls
(Rettberg and Gajjala 2015). In security politics throughout Europe,
such portrayals have been indirectly and post-factually used as
justifications to curb migration and increase security measures at the
borders and in public spaces -- [which further adds to the embodied
*in*security of those identified as racial Others.]{.underline}

#### USFG action can never solve gendered violence and war \-- NATO will always been framed as the savoir and "righteous defender" of vulnerable feminine bodies in order to justify violence against other countries. In Kosovo, the media did exactly this, they strove to "protect" the "victims" there only so they could remain these feminized, vulnerable, victims that NATO can use to promote their own invulnerability agendas

military and political tool**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Milic 1993; B. Allen
1996; Rejali 1998). Lynda Boose, for instance, argues that the sexual
sadism of Serbian brutality was crucial to this \"orgy of nationalism\"
(2002, 74). Statistics vary widely but conservative estimates of women
raped in Bosnia range from twenty thousand to fifty thousand. (Boose
2002) [U.S. media attention turned to Kosovo/a in the late 1990s as
violence escalated against Albanian Muslim populations. The [moment of
most intense interest in the region came during the NATO bombings when
the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [was directly involved in]{.mark} the
[conflict through]{.mark} its [military presence]{.mark}. NATO
operations never achieved the popular support of the Gulf War, coming as
they did shortly after the impeachment hearings of President
Clinton.]{.underline} Instead, the bomb- ings provoked intense debates
about appropriate methods of humanitarian intervention as well as
exposed the problematic nature of NATO\'s very existence after 1991.
Television, newspapers, and the major newsmagazines all provided
extensive coverage of the war. Even with the pervasiveness of
television, Time, Newsweek, and U.S. News continue to influence a wide
variety of Americans because \"nearly every high school, public and
academic library\" purchases them (Ulrich\'s Periodical Directory 2003).
Major media con- glomerates that own Time (Time-Warner) and Newsweek
(Washington Post, Inc.) - U.S. News is independently published - are
part of the powerful network of American and European news media that
control \"what much of the world reads, watches, and hears in its
foreign news \...\" (Shulman 1994, 108). Crucially, these newsmagazines
frame global economic, political, and social conflicts through racial
and gender categories that in turn justify the U.S. government\'s
encroaching and imperialist notions of globalization. [The first two
weeks of the bombings in April 1999 were a crucial period during which
the news magazines established narrative conventions for reporting the
bombings]{.underline}. [The first week\'s coverage featured lengthy
discussions of U.S. military and political strategies, as well as
articles on Milosevic as the locus of nationalist violence and reports
on ethnic cleansing. Photographs show U.S. military and political
leaders,]{.underline} Milosevic, maps of the region that depict US/NATO
strategies for attack, and some pictures of refugees. Coverage in the
second week focused more exten- [sively on the refugees with numerous
photographs of people walking along roads or railroad tracks and in the
camps, photographs of military and political leaders, as well as more
maps and pictures of U.S. soldiers. Articles continued to focus
primarily on U.S. and NATO policies and military strategies, although
reporters included more discussion of Albanian Kosovars\' experiences of
Serbian brutality.]{.underline} Visual culture scholars are increasingly
exploring the power of the visual to shape and mediate knowledge beyond
simplistic models of propaganda or image manipulation (Liss 1998,
xviii). Frequently reproduced and revered photographs of war, like
Robert Capa\'s \"Death of a Loyalist Soldier\" (1936) or Nick Ut\'s
\"Terror of War\" (the 1973 photograph of a young Vietnamese girl
running naked from a Napalm attack) are not those with the most detail
but those with the greatest symbolic value (Griffin 1999). As Liss
writes[, \"At stake are the ways in which photographs are set in motion,
how they are employed to stand in for wrenching, almost unrepresentable
events]{.underline}\" (1998, xii). This study provides detailed visual
analyses of news photographs in Time, Newsweek, and U.S. News & World
Report to examine which photographs \"stand in\" or represent the
bombing campaign. Because of publishing deadlines, weekly news-
magazines function like a \"news digest\" that recapitulates television
and newspaper reports on events of the previous week, using photographs
as visual \"highlights\" (Griffin and Lee 1995, 814). These visual
highlights are less important as factual reportage than they are for
their symbolic function. I will analyze the similarities in topics of
coverage, narrative strategies, and visual conventions, including some
repetition of specific photographs.7 This article, however, does not
address the interpretive audiences of these news reports, whose
readings, of course, will always be plural.8 All three magazines
**[[promoted a narrative of American rescue of victims in a dangerous
and unstable regio]{.mark}n.]{.underline}**9 An April 12 photograph from
US News, for instance, s[hows a white American soldier in full combat
gear in the extreme foreground. He frames the picture so that the viewer
looks with him into the background at several cars on a desolate road.
The viewer thus \"sees\" what the soldier is there to protect
(presumably these are civilian refugees although the people in the cars
remain unidentified). Above the photograph, the headline \"Can the
Cavalry Ride to the Rescue?\" aligns a racial ideal of hegemonic
masculinity with U.S. military efforts in this visual rescue narrative.
Although the question mark suggest ambiguity in the situation, the
exclusive focus in the article on the relative merits of different
military strategies raises questions about policy rather than social or
ethical concerns. This tag line, moreover, invokes American narratives
of the frontier, referencing the imperialist imaginary of the U.S.
cavalry protecting white settlers from dangerous Indians. Here, the
picture and the tag line connect whiteness and masculinity to the rescue
narrative through a mythic temporality in which social actors enact
historically defined roles (Fabian 1983).]{.underline} The three
newsmagazines reported on U.S. military and political leaders, military
technology and strategies, and the political debates over the utility of
air strikes[.]{.mark} [Other NATO political leaders were rarely dis-
cussed, with only occasional references to the military capabilities of
the allied countries.10 Reporters **paid little attention to the reasons
for the conflict**, except to blame the violence on the nationalist
ambitions of Milosevic, whom one U.S. official referred to as the
\"tinhorn dictator of Serbia\" (Time April 5, 40).]{.underline} Like
discussions of Saddam Hussein during the Gulf War (Shohat 1994), the
U.S. news media focused almost exclusively on the national leader,
[turning this conflict into a personalized fight against the excessive
evils of nationalism]{.underline}. News reports described him as a
dictator, a thug, a communist party hack, and a man of no political
convictions except to stay in power. Feminist scholars have challenged
representations of the Balkan conflicts that focus solely on individual
leaders through documentation of the collective and localized dimensions
of ethnic/political violence. Mertus (1999a) and Boose (2002), for
instance, offer analyses of how the gender and sexual rhetorics of
Serbian national- ism played into and exacerbated local ethnic tensions
and conflicts. **[[Instead of more complex historical analyses, news
narratives typically provide American viewers with an easily identified
enemy, a narrative of us/ them frequently structured on racial
logics.]{.mark}]{.underline}** This news strategy is apparent once again
in George W. Bush\'s \"war on terrorism,\" which initially focused
almost exclusively on Osama bin Laden as the leader of Al Qaeda[. When
the U.S. military failed to capture him, the Bush administration then
turned to Saddam Hussein. Milosevic\'s European and white identities
precluded the racial logic that characterize representations of Osama
bin Laden and Saddam Hussein. Rather, the media demonized the Serbian
leader through references to World War II, associating ethnic cleansing
with the Holocaust and Milosevic with Hitler.11 Drawing these parallels
provides the symbolic connection to a historical genocide that in turn
locates the Serbian leader, and by extension Serbia itself, as outside
of civilized nationhood. Individualizing this violence, furthermore,
dehistori- cizes the complexities of the situation (including European
and U.S. historical involvement in this conflict). As Fabian (1983)
argues, this symbolic association positions the other, in this case
Milosevic, in a past distinct from the temporal space of the viewer. In
the second week, for instance, all three magazines published the same
photograph of a long train filled to overflowing with refugees, many of
whom are hanging out of the windows. Extending across the entire frame
of the composition from the left foreground into the right background,
the train effectively blocks any view of the city behind. This keeps the
gaze in the foreground where hundreds of people stand on the train
platform.]{.underline} Pictures like this one accentuate the cultural
and geographical distance from the United States to Kosovo/a. As other
analysts of American news practices have noted, the media typically
represent distant places, espe- cially outside of the West, as a \"world
of trouble\" where disasters, wars, and the breakdown of the social
order occur (Morley 2000, 183). The train photograph explicitly
historicizes the scene through the visual allusion to the trains used by
the Nazis to bring the Jews to the death camps. Such references (and
there are many in these reports) render the scene familiar, and
presumably sympathetic, to Americans who have at least a popular
understanding of the Holocaust. Written texts further link ethnic
cleansing to a historical narrative of fascism and ethnic hatred through
references to Neville Chamberlain and Czechoslovakia. Using the
historical specter of appeasement as a plea for intervention, reporters
quoted political leaders who spoke of the possibility of violence
spreading to the rest of Europe. Western commentators supportive of the
NATO air strikes often warned of the dangers of appeasement as part of a
larger appeal on behalf of human rights. [The problem, [however, is that
\"this purely humanitarian-ethical legitimization . . . depoliticizes
the military intervention]{.mark}\" (Zizek 2000, 57). I2 Specifically,
the narrative of \"humanitarian\" military intervention depoliticizes
the racial selectivity that determines such intervention. A racialized
narrative is evident in the photographs in which Albanian Muslims look
white, like the presumed reader, if a little backward. Critical
commentators at the time identified NATO\'s racial selectivity in
contrast to the lack of international military campaigns to stop the
genocide in Rwanda, or other sites of ethnic/political conflict such as
Sierra Leone and Palestine (Chomsky 1999; Haynes 1999).]{.underline}
Throughout the 1990s, American news media extensively reported on
genocidal acts of ethnic cleansing and other forms of oppression by
Serbian nationalists against ethnic populations in Bosnia, Kosovo, and
elsewhere in the former Yugoslavia. Beginning in 1998, Serbian and
Yugoslav forces began an increasingly escalated campaign against Alba-
nians in Kosovo. According to some critics, however, mass expulsions and
killings associated with ethnic cleansing did not occur until after the
bombings started on March 24. In the words of NATO Supreme Allied
Commander Wesley Clark, it was \"entirely predictable\" that Serbian
violence would escalate once the bombings started (Chomsky 1999, 37).
Critics have charged that NATO and the United States did not wait to
exhaust diplomatic and economic options, but instead retrospectively
used evidence of ethnic cleansing to justify the bombings (Chomsky 1999;
Haynes 1999). While humanitarian issues were of concern to many, NATO
prestige was also on the line. Since the end of the Cold War, to
reconfigure its legitimacy as an international institution.
Interventions in the Balkans were part of a larger effort by NATO to
extend its reach to a wider geopolitical arena than the original purpose
of the European Alliance. As British Prime Minister Tony Blair of
Britain explained, \"To walk away now would destroy NATO\'s
credibility\" (Chomsky 1999, 40). [**[Arguments about humanitarian
intervention also ignore the substantial material interests at stake for
NATO and the United States]{.underline}**.]{.mark} [These interests
include [investments by arms manufactures and]{.mark} Western
[businesses, oil companies\' efforts to secure pipelines]{.mark} across
the Balkans, and the role of the IMF-World Bank in the region. In the
late 1980s and 1990s, for in- stance, IMF-World Bank policies that
demanded austerity programs to secure debt repayment increased the
economic instabilities of the region. Moreover, as the former Yugoslavia
broke up, recognition or non-recogni- tion of states by Western
countries had a significant and unequal impact on their political
economies. Pressure on the Clinton administration also came from
expatriate groups in the United States as well as businesses advocating
international policies that increased their access to global markets
(Haynes 1999).]{.underline} Penezic argues that Western news depictions
of nationalist conflict in post-communist states reproduce a Cold War
paradigm that blames ethnic violence and the rise of economic disasters
on the former communist regimes and on nationalist overreactions.
\"Whether or not this was true for the Eastern Bloc, Yugoslavia\'s
situation was not quite that simple. The country has been decentered and
federal, with multilingual education, publishing, press, television, and
so forth. While this regulated and strictly controlled ethnic tolerance
might not have been enough to assuage nationalist hungers, reducing the
causes of war to nationalism only is, in my opinion, overly simplistic\"
(Penezic 1995, 63). None of the news coverage of the NATO bombings
discussed the unstable economic and political conditions in the
post-communist period, especially the region\'s relationship to the West
and to global economic forces. Instead, all three magazines displayed a
U.S. -centered analysis that reproduced a familiar narrative of Western
rescue of victims in a dangerously unstable region. As Koshy points out,
the American media \"still remains primarily oriented to a national
context and is thus unable to generate a transnational frame- work of
understanding adequate to the complex problems of globaliza- tion\"
(1999, 20). [[Rescue narratives emphasized the vulnerability of Kosovars
and the humanitarianism of military intervention.]{.mark} Crucially, the
newsmagazines characterized the Balkans as an agricultural area that
still relies on primi- tive farming techniques and a place of historic
ethnic rivalries. Pictures show people fleeing in primitive modes of
transportation, walking in single file on railroad tracks to avoid land
mines or walking in desolate landscapes.]{.underline} In Newsweek, for
instance, an April 12 [photograph shows a man in the foreground pushing
a wheelbarrow in which sits an elderly woman wrapped in a headscarf,
winter coat, and blanket. Behind them another man also pushes an elderly
person in a wheelbarrow and two others walk along the road. This
primitive mode of transportation underscores the refugees\' vulnerable
status while the desolate landscape offers no clues to specific
geographical, temporal, or cultural locations. [Old helpless women,
cared for by men, all of whom appear white,]{.mark} with limited re-
sources (wheelbarrows) [create a sympathetic portrait]{.mark}. It also
[renders men]{.mark} [solely]{.mark} within a [subordinate
masculinity]{.mark} that [depends on the protection of outside
forces]{.mark} while women are visualized as vulnerable and needy
because of their age, race, and gender. The exclusive gaze at peasants
in a pre- modern setting, of course, also erases the range of material
resources and cultural experiences of the Albanian Kosovars.13
Physically locating the conflict in this nightmarish space, pictures
like this one and the one of the train station participate in creating
what Zizek refers to as the \"imagined cartography\" of the Balkans that
depicts this region as a \"terrain of ethnic horrors\" still fighting
centuries-old battles presumably in contrast to the advanced democratic
status of the West]{.underline} (Zizek 2000, 4-5). [While this perhaps
raises the question of what is the West, it also resecures a cultural
map that defines Europe as the countries of Western Europe while the
Balkans remain somewhere on the fringes of civilization]{.underline}.
These images also play into Cold War narratives that visualize socialism
as a failure of modernity. Such narratives deny how transnational
dependencies and determinations shape the region\'s economy. Hyper-
inflation, austerity measures, and other economic constraints since the
collapse of communist regimes in the region have intensified social and
political unrest. Escalating debt increasingly weakened the region\'s
economies, led to worker protests, and fostered the prestige of
nationalist solutions by Milosevic and his supporters (Haynes 1999).
Yet, news media ignored or minimized local, regional, and transnational
factors that have shaped ethnic conflict in the Balkans in favor of
representations of NATO heroics. [The lack of references to Albanian
politics ignores the complicated and hybrid nature of Albanian
identities and political activisms.]{.underline} [Moreover, it promotes
American national interests at the expense of local and regional
factors. The only coverage of Albanian responses to Serbian violence was
reports on the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), a small militant group.
None of the magazines, for instance, discussed the nonviolent agenda of
the Albanian intellectual and political leader Ibrahim
Rugov]{.underline}a (Chomsky 1999; Mertus 1999a, 6). [Photographs
instead featured male soldiers of the KLA in combat uniforms, yet there
are no signs of actual combat.14 Compared with detailed discussions of
American military equipment, strategy, and personnel, reports on the KLA
emphasized the lack of equipment, training, and even incompetence of
these fighters. This **[contrast further eliminates political
alternatives to the spectacle of victim- ization]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Zizek argues [**[that NATO intervened to protect Kosovar victims while
making sure they would remain victims]{.underline}**;]{.mark} [that is,
no international support backed the Albanians to become full political
agents, or to sustain an armed resistance]{.underline}. [He describes
this as the \"paradox of victimization: the Other to be protected is
good in so Jar as it remains a victim\"]{.underline} (2000, 59, 60).
[News coverage of [victims waiting to be rescued erases U.S. and
European nations\' complicity in the economic and political
instabilities in the regio]{.mark}n]{.underline}. [Petras further argues
that innocent victimization also ignores the violence perpetrated by the
KLA. He writes that the \"triumphal returns and euphoric rhetoric of the
NATO leaders covers up the brutal reality of massive ethnic cleansing,
systematic assassinations, pillage and destruc- tion of churches,
houses, farms, and businesses by NATO-backed Alba- nian KLA terrorists
and their paramilitary supporters\" (1999, 13).]{.underline} As
important as it is to publicize the horrors of war and ethnic cleans-
ing, [these photographs elide any representations of the subjectivity
and agency of the Albanians. Cameras do not depict the diversity of
experiences and cultures in Kosovo/a (]{.underline}Mertus 1999a). [No
pictures show people working in an urban setting or creating a makeshift
home or treating the injured.15 Nor do readers encounter photographs of
Albanian doctors, social workers, community leaders, etc. Instead,
photographs depict fearful and/or exhausted refugees]{.underline}.16 In
a half-page picture featured in U.S. News on April 12, for instance, the
photographer used a high angle shot of a group of refugees. The high
angle makes the crowd appear very large as people spread out to the very
edges of the background. In the center foreground, a woman holds out her
hands in a supplicant pose with the , \"[Pleading. A woman from Kosovo
asks Macedonian police officers to let her cross the border. Thousands
waited without food or water.\" As the focal point of the composition,
the female supplicant stands as the representative of the \"waiting\"
group. Women such as the suppli- cant become, in Zizek\'s words, the
\"ideal subject-victim in aid\" (2000, 57- 58) who do not struggle for
their own survival or fight back but remain the feminized object of the
Western gaze. These **[pictures provide the visual alibi for U.S. and
NATO intervention by establishing a national narrative about U.S. power
and political good in contrast to Milosevic and his Serbian
forces]{.mark}**. The racial logic is here reinforced because few signs
recognizable to Western viewers would identify the refugees as Muslim.
Racial and religious differences are elided in this portrayal of
Albanians as allies.]{.underline} [Instead, gender is foregrounded
through prominently featured photographs of mothers with small chil-
dren, namely on two magazine covers and as the opening two-page spread
in all three magazines the second week. Collapsing the body with experi-
ence and identity, photojournalism relies on the bodies of mothers and
babies to function as metonyms for the Kosovo/a crisis.]{.underline}
[**[Recent feminist scholarship on embodiment has explored with great
insight how identity, especially sexual, gender, and racial identities
are produced and repro- duced through visible
bodies]{.underline}**.]{.mark}17 [**[In]{.mark} the [news coverage
of]{.mark} the [NATO bomb- ings,]{.mark} the [visual embodiment of white
motherhood]{.mark}, however[, does not so much produce knowledge or
understanding of trauma as it turns subjects into spectacles of
suffering.]{.mark}** As [metonyms for victimization, photographs of
women and children collapse motherhood with the home]{.mark} (Morley
2000, 65) and in so doing become the [visible symbol of what is being
threatened and what needs to be saved.]{.mark}]{.underline} [For
instance, a tightly framed photograph in U.S. News from April 12 shows a
group of refugees enclosed in an space that appears to be surrounded by
barbed wire (the caption explains that the wire is part of the back of a
truck) (fig. 2). In the center of the composition, a woman throws her
head back in anguish while a child next to her stares soberly at the
camera. This highly emotional expression of innocence and vulnerability
establishes the face of suffering for the viewer]{.underline}. In such
pictures, sub- jectivities are elided as visible bodies rearticulate
racialized gender ideals of domesticity familiar to American audiences
(Williams 1994). Despite late twentieth-century social developments that
include post-communism, globalization, and new technologies, idealized
domesticity continues to {{Fig.2 ommited}} Fig. 2. Photograph by
Santiago Lyon. Courtesy of AP/Wide World Photos. have enormous
ideological resonance (Morley 2000, 56). Since the Cold War period, [the
American media have aligned an ideal of the white middle class family
with national interests and desires (Kozol 1994). These pictures of
refugees from Kosovo/a reveal the powerful place that the racialized
mother-child ideal continues to hold in the U.S. cognitive grid.
Whiteness, furthermore, contains the otherness of Albanian Kosovars who,
like this anguished Albanian mother, lack racial, ethnic or religious
markers of difference. If class, racial, gender, and heteronormative
ideals shape the cultural alignment of family and nation, what happens
when domesticity, that powerful sign of stability and tradition, is
figured as the sign of social disorder or breakdown?]{.underline} [Media
portrayals of the ideal family typically establish boundaries of
identity that exclude all those who do not fit these racial, sexual, and
class categorizations.]{.underline} Morley, however, compellingly argues
that not all representations of domesticity are so intentionally
exclusive. Instead, he writes, \"it is not the presence of otherness per
se which is problematic but only that of undomesticated otherness,\"
pointing out examples of the incorpo- ration of Others, or what he
calls, \"domesticating alterity\" (2000, 223). In other words, [the
logics of racialization are often dependent upon incorpo- rating
otherness within \"the relation of domination\" (Taguieff 2001, 121).
News photographs of Kosovar refugees foreground racialized gender ideals
of domesticity in this moment of profound crisis and social disor- der.
Narratives about conflicts in the Balkans have historically been mapped
onto ethnic rivalries and hostilities that stereotype populations as
violent and backward.]{.underline} During the Cold War, for instance,
the American media typically collapsed ethnicity and communism in
characterizations of Albania as one of the most repressive communist
regimes. In contrast, news coverage of refugees in 1999 turned the
camera\'s gaze to mothers and children to figure Albanians as the
innocent victims of Serbian aggression. Ideals of domesticity that
feature attractive, white looking, mothers elide differences to
establish instead the moral position of the refugees. [The cover
photograph in U.S. News for April 12 exemplifies the process of
domesticating alterity. Above the headline, \"Balkan Hell,\" three
figures in the center of the composition look out at the camera. With a
somber but calm gaze, a young attractive woman holds a small child while
an older son leans against her. Although the caption does not identify
her religious affiliation, the coverage repeatedly characterized the
violence in Kosovo/a as an ethnic conflict between Serbian Christians
and Albanian Muslims. That this woman is not specifically identified as
a Muslim reinforces the process of incorporation within an American
ideal of domesticity. Even **more** than other mother and child images,
this photograph evokes the Western Christian art historical tradition of
the Madonna and child flanked by one or more saints. In the extreme
foreground a woman with her head covered in a white cloth moves toward
the picture plane. Her forward posture suggests movement outside of the
camera\'s frame and into the viewer\'s space. The triangular position of
the main figure group creates a stability that counterbalances the
dynamic movement of this foreground figure. The compositional and
iconographic stability signified by this Madonna and children, as Morley
suggests, domesticates the refugees\' alterity. This process occurs
through foregrounding heteronormativity, albeit normativity at risk.
During the Balkans wars, reporters often told of Serbian detention and
killings of fathers and husbands. To see the family without the male
figure underscores the social crisis and reinforces the call to rescue
the mothers and children. Even as this woman is incorporated within an
American cognitive ideal of domesticity, however, she remains other in
her (unlabeled) ethnicity and in her state of crisis. She is thus both
like and unlike the viewer. Looking at how photographs mobilize domes-
ticity reveals the ways in which narratives of war incorporate alterity
as part of justifications for military intervention.]{.underline} In the
newsmagazines, scenes of destroyed houses, rather than pictures of
military battles, further configure the Albanians visually within the
private sphere. In American hegemonic culture, the private sphere
signifies the privileges of privacy, intimacy, and protection from the
external world. On April 5, both Time and Newsweek featured a photograph
of a Serbian army tank in front of a destroyed house with signs of still
smoldering fires. A Serbian soldier holding a rifle, caught mid-stride
in profile, looks defiantly at the camera. Masculinity and militarism
foreground the threat to private life and to the vulnerable bodies of
the Albanians. The accompa- nying report discusses the invasion of
private homes by paramilitary forces where people were either tortured
or removed from families and then tortured. Domesticity, as the sign of
what is at risk, and hence as the justification for intervention,
locates the Albanians within terms recogniz- able to American audiences.
In [a region such as Kosovo/a, many reasons compel photojournalists to
report on the violence that persists there despite juridical and
humanitar- ian interventions by international agencies like the UN or
military interven- tions like the NATO air strike]{.underline}s. [In
**[domesticating alterity, however, Ameri- can news coverage of
Kosovo/]{.mark}a** relied on conventions of
photojournalism]{.underline}, [in particular the [**figure of vulnerable
white maternity**,]{.mark} to depict the human casualties of violence in
the Balkans. News coverage that represents Albanians only as victims
[ignores their struggles and experiences while promoting narratives of
Western benevolent support for needy and inno- cent
refugees]{.mark}]{.underline}. Representations of crises outside the
United States, as in this case, are typically mediated through the lens
of national concerns, such as security or economic interests. As Koshy
writes, \"On human rights issues, in particular, the statist perspective
obscures and distorts the perception of the problem and the construction
of the solution . . .\" (1999, 21). Thus, what is at stake in media
coverage is the relationship between how social crises are represented
and how they are managed within a transnational context. Given this
critique of photojournalism, how can photographers main- tain the moral
imperative of political visibility? The challenge of reportage in this
case is made particular acute by the problematics of representing
trauma. How can photographers visualize trauma without inevitably
turning people into spectacles? If photographers attempt to avoid the
spectacle of embodied suffering, what happens if we do not have an
embodied victim to pity?

#### Debate has always been constructed though the masculine feminine dichotomy. Feminine debaters are forced to distance themselves from their femininity in order to be taken seriously and be competitive within the activity. However, when they do that too much, they are too bitchy. It is a game that becomes impossible to win. Instead, we need to challenge the dichotomy, allowing feminine debaters to embrace their individual identities.

pressures I felt within the debate community were great]{.underline}.
[At the beginning of my collegiate debate career I was not very focused
on the competitive aspects of debate]{.underline}. My partner and I
would win some debates, but what was most important to me at that time
was socializing with other debaters. [I do not encourage other women in
debate to adopt such an attitude]{.underline}, [but I also do not think
that women who have such an attitude should be stigmatized]{.underline}.
[I found that as one of the few females on the debate circuit I was
accepted socially by almost every other debater I met]{.underline},
[whether they were junior-varsity participants or one of the top
first-rounds]{.underline}. I was able to have fun with these people and
it did not seem to matter that I was often much less successful in
debate than they were. In fact, I think that it was easier for them to
\"hang out\" with me because I was not in direct competition with them.
When I changed partners and became part of a first-round team, things
changed. [I can recall countless occasions when friends of mine
virtually ignored me in discussions about debate rounds or issues and
addressed all of their questions to my male partner. This kind of
behavior marginalized my worth as a debater. It always amazed me that
other debaters (who were my friends) could totally ignore me as a
\"debater\"; I was only truly recognized in a social
context]{.underline}. [I think the social side of debate is
important\--some of my best friends are debaters\--but every debater
should have the opportunity to develop both the social and the
competitive sides of debate]{.underline}.[I do not mean to imply that
women in debate have little hope of becoming true equals to the men of
debate or that they are destined to occupy only a social role and will
forever remain at the peripheries of debate success]{.underline}.

views have started to change. [Women have become successful in these
so-called]{.underline} \"[male areas]{.underline}\" and I think that
debate as well will increasingly come to reflect these changes. [A
[woman can be feminine and still excel at argumentation and logical
reasoning]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [I fundamentally [disagree with
those]{.mark} in the debate community [who]{.mark} would [urge women to
become more ]{.mark}]{.underline}[\"[masculine]{.underline}\" [in order
to achieve a higher level of]{.underline} ]{.mark}[debate
[success]{.mark}. Giving into stereotypes will only serve to perpetuate
such myths. As a debater, I resisted such pressures]{.underline}, [held
on to my femininity]{.underline}, [and still managed to have a
successful debate experience]{.underline}. [I encourage other women in
debate to do the same]{.underline}. [We must fight the pressure and be
true to ourselves; there is no fundamental reason why only \"masculine\"
women can succeed in debate]{.underline}.[As a final note, I think that
it is important for all of us to encourage more women (and minorities as
well]{.underline}) [to participate in collegiate debate]{.underline}. [I
know that many female high school debaters decide against debating in
college because they feel the activity is too hostile to
women]{.underline}. I [think that this is a tragedy and that coaches and
debaters alike should discourage such attitudes. After all, our society
is sexist,]{.underline} [but does that mean women should avoid becoming
active participants and leaders? Of course not]{.underline}. [In the
same way]{.underline}, [women should not shy away from collegiate
debate]{.underline}. I can honestly say that I have acquired many
valuable skills through my involvement in debate. [Giving up is not the
answer]{.underline}. Raising awareness will certainly help, [but I think
the key really lies with the women in debate themselves]{.underline}.
[We must decide to stay involved]{.underline}, [encourage other women we
know to participate, and most importantly, refuse to settle for anything
less than real equality and complete autonomy. LISA DIXKaren
Finley]{.underline}, one of my favorite poets, writes with power and
knowledge of her experiences as a woman. [Her poem entitled \"I Was Not
Expected To Be Talented\" is for me a powerful expression of my feelings
about being a woman in debate.]{.underline} [The poem goes like this
\...Just smile]{.underline}, act pretty, [open the door]{.underline},
[and clean the toilet]{.underline}. You say one day at a time well,
[it\'s a slow death! Remember the homeless]{.underline}, [the
poor]{.underline}, [the suffering]{.underline}. Well, [I\'m suffering
inside!\...You know why I only feel comfortable around the

inebriated]{.underline}, [the helpless and the poor-\'CAUSE THEY LOOK
LIKE WHAT I FEEL INSIDE! They look]{.underline}, they look, they look
like what I feel inside! You see, I WAS NOT EXPECTED TO BE TALENTED. [I
am using this poem to relate to my experiences in debate as a
woman]{.underline}. I feel that it is important for me to be as honest
as I can about my experiences, [yet at the same time to relate a message
that is positive for women who are entering the activity]{.underline}.
[The story I\'m about to tell is a coming to terms about my
\"place\"]{.underline} [in debate as a woman]{.underline}. [I am a
policy debater at the University of Utah]{.underline}. [I did not debate
in high school]{.underline}, although I did do some individual events.
From my experience in high school, I think individual events were sort
of the \"woman\'s place.\" I was not expected to be talented in debate;
however, [I feel that women can be VERY talented if they are just
encouraged to participate]{.underline}. [This is the reason I am writing
this paper]{.underline}. [I believe that by subverting the notion of a
\"woman\'s place\" in debate, and by being able to define our own
\"place]{.underline}\" [as women]{.underline}, [more women will be
encouraged to participate in debate at the high school and collegiate
levels]{.underline}.[The first time I was aware of my]{.underline}
\"[place\" in debate as a woman was at a regular season
tournament]{.underline}. [I was at the awards ceremony listening to the
top twenty speaker awards; not one of them was a woman. Women were
winning awards at the novice and junior levels]{.underline}, [but for
varsity women to win speaker awards was out of the
question]{.underline}. I thought to myself, at least we were winning
some awards, but my coach quickly told me that not very many women ever
win speaker awards past the junior and novice levels. [I guess I am very
reluctant to accept that novice and junior debate is the
only]{.underline} \"place\" [for women]{.underline}. [I am not taking
anything away from novice and junior women debaters]{.underline}; [my
argument is that these women deserve a chance to win on the varsity
level as well]{.underline}. [Another experience that reminded me quickly
where my \"place\" in debate is was in a round at the beginning of last
season]{.underline}. [A male debater put his arm around me during cross
examination and said, \"chill out, babe.\" I quickly thought to myself,
\"I am not your babe,\" but I said nothing and immediately sat
down]{.underline}. I felt very objectified, humiliated, and angry. By
treating me as a sex object, [that male debater quickly put me in
my]{.underline} \"[place.[\"Women in debate have to deal with a double
standard]{.mark}]{.underline}[. **[If we are not feminine enough we are
thought of as \"bitchy,\" yet if we are too feminine, we are not taken
seriously. I urge all women to hold on to both.]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[[We need to construct ourselves outside of the masculine/ feminine
dichotomy-we should be able to have a place in debate because we are
talented]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [At the 1992 National Debate
Tournament]{.underline}, my partner (who is a woman) [and I noticed that
there were only four women teams at the tournament]{.underline} (76
teams total), [and none of the women teams advanced to the double
octafinal round]{.underline}. In fact, [only four women cleared at
all]{.underline}. Not one woman won a speaker award. [I am proud of
those women who were in the out-rounds]{.underline}. [I am also proud of
all the women who are in debate]{.underline}. [It is time for women to
demand a]{.underline} \"[place.\" It is past time for women in debate to
be considered talented]{.underline}. [I feel that if women are
encouraged on the high school level to start and stay with
debate]{.underline}, [we will not be the minority or the
marginalized]{.underline}. [Only then can we truly get past being placed
in a subordinate position; we will be able to define our own
\"place]{.underline}\" [in debate on our own terms]{.underline}.

#### To have a temporary, isolated sense of power over all events and circumstances, is a lovely illusionary privilege and perhaps the prime and most beautifully constructed conceit of being human and especially of being youthfully human, but it is a privilege that must be surrendered with that same youth, with ill health, with accident, with the loss of loved ones who do not share our untouchable powers; powers eventually and most emphatically given up, as we approach our last breath.

#### The assigning of vulnerability disproportionately on feminine subjects creates gendered hierarchies and gendered violence. And, because masculine subjects need to be invulnerable, they respond with violence or potential violence with violence, making war inevitable and unending.

**Peet and Sjoberg, 2020 **(Laura Sjoberg, Professor of Political
Science at U Florida; the Late Jessica Peet taught IR at the University
of Florida and USC. Introduction to *Gender and Civilian Victimization
in War *(Print Book), SPP)

As scholars, the \"lenses\" we use \"foreground some things, and
background others\" in our research (V. Peterson and Runyan 1999). [Our
research questions start with the ideas, concepts, and variables we see
as most important in global politics.]{.underline} For example, the
scholars who have written on intentional civilian victimization have
started with the ideas, concepts, and variables they see as most
important in global politics, including regime type, international law,
strategy, and culture. Like other scholars in IR, feminist work uses
\"lenses\" to foreground variables of particular interest, specifically
sex, gender, and sexuality; gender identity; and gender hierarchy, using
\"gender lenses\" to view global politics (V. Peterson and Runyan 1999:
2). [Looking through gender lenses is a way \"to focus on gender as a
particular kind of power relation, or to trace out the ways in which
gender is central to understanding international
processes\"]{.underline} (Steans 1998: 5). While women\'s oppression is
a primary concern for feminists, \"[the driving force of feminism is its
attention to gender and not simply to women \.... \[T\]he concept,
nature and practice of gender are key\"]{.underline} (Zalewski 1995).
Feminists, then, \"ask what assumptions about gender (and race, class,
nationality, and sexuality) are necessary to make particular statements,
policies, and actions meaningful\" (Wilcox 2009). In our analysis of
civilian victimization, we focus on how [the concept, nature, and
practice of gender influences states\' and other war-fighting parties\'
decisions to target civilians]{.underline} and ask what assumptions
about gender are necessary to make intentional civilian victimization
appealing, despite the non-combatant immunity norm. With this focus, [we
also look at the intersections of gender, race, ethnicity, and
nationalism in constituting both the idea of the civilian and her
vulnerability.]{.underline} In order to fully grasp why those are
important questions, we need to spend a little time understanding what
feminists mean by \'sex\' and by \'gender\' in this context. Many people
see sex as biology - male and fem ale sex organs make people men or
women. 4 In the conventional wisdom, then, gender is directly related
to, and maps onto, sex - men are masculine and women are feminine.
However, feminist scholarship has \"questioned the conventional
assumption that gender differences (and subordination) are rooted in
biological differences between women and men\" (Scott 1987; Sjoberg
2006a: 32). Instead, feminist scholars suggest that the relation between
sex and gender is presumed rather than natural, where masculinity and
femininity are separable from maleness and femaleness. Masculine
characteristics, like strength, protectiveness, rationality,
aggressiveness, presence in public life, domination, and leadership,
then, are perceived as related to maleness, while in reality they are
not reserved for men. Conversely, traits associated with femininity,
like weakness, vulnerability, emotion, passivity, privacy, submission,
and care, are assumed to be the domain of women, while that is not
always or even normally the case. Genderings can be read into and back
onto sex, which is malleable rather than set, and co-constituted with
gender (e.g., Butler 1990, 1993). Applying this understanding, [gender
cannot be operationalized as a \'yes\' or \'no\' (or \'male\' or
\'female\' question]{.underline}), or as a matter of degree. It also
cannot be accounted for by asking questions about \'what women do\'
differently than \'what men do\' in global politics.5 Instead, [it is
more of a constellation of significations, where masculinities and
femininities are mutually constituted (along with race, class,
sexuality, etc.) in specific, hierarchical relation to one another -
where ( often) masculinities are prized and powerful, while femininities
are seen as undesirable and therefore subordinated]{.underline}. In this
context, we can talk not just about men and women and masculinities and
femininities but of masculinism and feminization. [Masculinism is the
prizing of masculinities and the exclusion and/ or devaluing of
femininities in social and/ or political contexts. Masculinism leads to
feminization - the devaluing of femininities by putting down or putting
aside people, groups, or ideas associated with femininities and by
associating devalued or marginalized people, groups, or ideas with
femininities]{.underline} (V. Peterson 2010; see also V. Peterson and
Runyan 2010). 6 V. Spike Peterson describes feminization as
devalorization: [Not only subjects]{.underline} (women and marginalized
men), [but also concepts]{.underline}, desires, tastes, [styles, \"ways
of knowing\" \... can be feminized - with the effect of reducing their
legitimacy, status and value]{.underline}. Importantly, this
devalorization is simultaneously ideological (discursive, cultural) and
material (structural, economic) \.... [This devalorization normalizes -
with the effect of \"legitimating\" - the marginalization,
subordination, and exploitation of feminized practices and persons \...
the \"naturalness\" of sex difference is generalized to the
\"naturalness\" of masculine (not necessarily male) privilege, so that
both aspects come to be taken-for -granted \"givens\" of social
life]{.underline} (V. Peterson 2010). In this vein, [a key tenet of
feminist theorizing about the global political arena is that it is
gender -hierarchical]{.underline} (Sjoberg 2009). Though masculinities
and femininities are detectable across known human history, they are not
static, temporally, geographically, or culturally. Quite the opposite,
the dominant \'masculinity\' or \'femininity\' is different at different
times, and in different places and cultures. While \"the exact content
of genders varies with various and shifting socio-political contexts,
\... gender subordination (defined as the subordination of femininities
to masculinities) remains a constant feature of social and political
life across time and space\" (Sjoberg and Gentry 2007: 9). Feminist
research in IR, then, asks how these complex notions of gender
constitute and influence the realities of everyday life in global
politics . In this book, we are particularly interested in how gender
influences belligerents\' (especially states\') decisions to attack
civilians in war in conjunction with other parts of the \'puzzle\' of
intentional civilian victimization. Thinking about gender and
intentional civilian victimization Revisiting the narratives that began
this introduction, it is possible to see gender influencing intentional
civilian victimization in what happened to Hassan and Benedicte and
their contemporaries. Referencing experiences like Benedicte\'s, Judith
Gardam has explained that rape is never truly aimed at or affecting just
one person (1993: 363). Instead, \"rape functions as a strategy to
deliver a blow against a collective energy by striking at a group of
high symbolic value\" (Pettman 1996: 190). By raping Benedicte,
government forces were attacking non -lvoirians by attacking \"their\"
women, as \"xenophobic speech \[was\] aimed specifically at women from
the \'enemy\' community,\" encouraging rape and sexual violence (Amnesty
International 2007). As a result, sexual violence became \"an
intentional strategy to terrorise, demean, and defeat an entire
population, as well as a way of engendering hate and destruction\"
between the rebels and the government in Cote d\'Ivoire (Amnesty
International 2004). In the 1990s war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, women
suffered the brunt of civilian victimization, as a result both of
apparently gender -neutral tactics and of a systematic campaign of
genocidal rape. Reports of mass rape began appearing in newspaper
headlines in August of 1992 (Hansen 2001: 55). Women were raped, both
individually and as proxy for the nation of Bosnia-Herzegovina also
being \'raped.\' The rape of civilian women was also the rape of
(\'their\') nation, an idea that was reiterated by Bosnian ambassador to
the United Nations addressing the Security Council in 1993:
Excellencies, Bosnia and Herzegovina is being gang-raped \... I do not
lightly apply the analogy of a gang rape to the plight of the Republic
of Bosnia and Herzegovina. As we know, systematic rape has been one of
the weapons of this aggression against the Bosnian women in particular.
(Metrovic 1994: xii) In this statement the rape of Bosnian women is
metaphor for the destruction and \'rape\' of a nation, literally and
figuratively. This sort of \"rape happens, not as a consequence of
thoughtless, provocative, or unfortunate behavior, but as a question of
national warfare\" (Hansen 2001: 59). Lene Hansen explains that, in
Bosnia, \[r \]aping \"the nation\'s women\" is not only an act of
violence against individual women; it also works to install a
disempowered masculinity as constitutive of the identities of the
nation\'s men. The interconnection between individual/ collective and
national/ gendered might also be illustrated by the way that a woman
impregnated by rape can be represented as a passive \"national\"
container of a child imagined to be the future bearer of the rapist\'s
nationality. In this way, an individual rape can be read for its
collective, national significance through the complex sign of the
child\'s imagined future identity as an embodiment of the enemy state.
(Hansen 2001: 60) Women were also targeted for violence that was not
explicitly sexual. Some Serb policy statements emphasized depriving
individual households of nutritional and medical resources necessary for
reproduction as a way to target the opponent ethnicities. Even the
targeting of men had gendered connotations and implications. Planning
for the Srebrenica massacre (where an estimated 8,000 men were killed,
selected as men for victimization), the killing was discussed as a
strategy for reducing the availability of men, who were characterized as
fertilizers and protectors for women. Planners referred to their
strategies as \"cleaning houses\" such that women would pose \"less
resistance to repopulation\" (referring to forced impregnation) without
\'their\' men. 7 Narratives like this could be and have been told of
many wars, genocides, conflicts, and terrorist attacks around the world.
In this book, we present evidence that when belligerents intentionally
victimize civilians, they are actually attacking women because of
women\'s actual and symbolic position in the life, livelihood, and
nationalist narratives of the opponent\'s state and/ or nation. While
most people who read Benedicte and Hasan\'s stories assume that
Benedicte\'s experience was a gendered form of civilian victimization
and Hasan\'s experience was tragic but a case of \'normal\' or
ungendered civilian victimization, we argue that it is not just in
sexual violence against civilians that civilian victimization is
gendered. Instead, when civilians are attacked in war, often
\'civilian\' is in important ways a proxy for women, not as female
bodies but for how they are positioned in and symbolic of nation and
state. Wartime sexual violence is {like other civilian victimization
tactics) a way to get to the \'heart\' of the opponent by destroying
both crucial resources and the very parts of their society which
legitimate the fighting of the war in the first place - pure, innocent
women that good men fight just wars to protect (see, e.g., Elshtain
1987). [Along these lines, we theorize intentional civilian
victimization through gender lenses]{.underline}. Expanding on feminist
work about nationalism and war generally, and the noncombatant immunity
principle specifically, we contend that [the very same logic that makes
belligerents so eager to \'protect\' their innocent women from wars also
encourages them to attack the women who are seen as belonging to their
enemies]{.underline}. In war stories, [just warriors fight the good
fight to protect their innocent women and children from those foreign or
outside men who would attack them]{.underline} (Huston 1983). [Just
warriors, then, legitimate not only wars generally but also their
masculinities specifically by protecting women back home]{.underline}
(Sjoberg 2006b). Attacking the women that motivate the opponent to
fight - the women that symbolize his state and/ or nation and whose
protection legitimates his war - attacks both the will to fight a
particular war and the logic of war-fighting. In these terms, as we will
discuss in more detail in Chapter 3, [intentional civilian victimization
can be seen as a product of the gendered narratives that legitimate and
sustain nationhood and the practices of the making and fighting of
wars.]{.underline} We are, of course, not arguing that women and only
women are killed in the victimization of civilians. Such an argument
would be both inaccurate and oversimplified. We are instead arguing that
\'[civilian victimization\' is, sometimes consciously and sometimes not,
an attack on women, where \'civilian\' is in important ways a proxy for
women. But this proxy is not a simple, one-to-one mapping where
belligerents think \'civilian\' but mean \'women\' (as women), even to
the extent that belligerents are willing to admit attacking civilians.
Rather the proxy is a complex indicator of state/nation, based on actual
and perceived strength. Belligerents attack (women) civilians for
the same reason they claim protection for their own - because
the \'protection racket\' is an underlying justification for states,
governments, and their wars]{.underline} (see, e.g., S. Peterson 1977).
Insomuch as women are indicators, signifiers, and reproducers
of state and nation, belligerents attack women to attack the state and
nation. [We contend that such an explanation, when compared to the
others that have been presented up to this point, provides both greater
theoretical leverage towards understanding the problem of civilian
targeting and greater empirical explanatory power for the particulars
of cases of civilian victimization in war]{.underline}. In the remainder
of this introduction, we outline how this book makes that argument and
presents both quantitative and qualitative empirical
evidence to support it.

**Our method is to embrace vulnerability. Only a recognition and
embodiment of vulnerability can reshape foreign policy in a manner that
does not replicate the hierarchical logic of the protection racket.
Whyte says that "vulnerability is not a choice" and he is right.**

**Väyrynen, 2019** (Tarja Väyrynen is a professor of Peace and Conflict
Research and a director of Tampere Peace Research Institute (TAPRI). Her
research interests include conflict resolution and peacebuilding,
feminist theory and post-colonial theory. "Mundane peace and the
politics of vulnerability: a nonsolid feminist research agenda,"
*Peacebuilding*, 7:2, 146-159, SPP)

As outlined above, early feminist peace and conflict researchers, such
as Elise Boulding and Sara Ruddick, insisted on the importance of the
relational body when studying peace. I also argued above that local turn
scholarship is limited in its understanding of the everyday and mundane
practices of peace. In my view, b[oth the relational body and mundane
practices require a more nuanced reading of power, governance and the
vulnerabilities that practices of power produce, since the body is
always both 'active and acted upon]{.underline}'.35 In short, practices
of governance that are targeted at the body also produce the body.36 Yet
the fleshy living body also has agency, which makes it an 'engaged
body-subject'.37 In other words, the body is never a passive target of
practices of governance: it also has a capacity to escape these
practices.38 Eighty-year-old Kaisu told her story in a Finnish
documentary film in 2010.39 She was among the Finnish women accused of
having fraternised with German soldiers during the Second World War. She
moved to Germany with the withdrawing German troops and was repatriated
to Finland after the war. The following is my description of Kaisu's
narrative: VIGNETTE 2 Kaisu was among the women whose bodies were
securitised and transferred to the camp immediately on their arrival on
the Finnish soil. She calls it the 'quarantine camp' as if there had
been something contagious in her body that needed purification. Hence
medicalisation also takes hold of her body even in her most intimate
memories. Her young body had been securitised and medicalised as it was
seen to constitute the contagious risk of knowing too much. In the
documentary, her body is stiff, but strong when she sits on the porch of
the barracks, in which she thinks she was incarcerated sixty years ago.
She is smoking a cigarette with a firm hand. Her body and her solemn
voice convey her strength. Kaisu recalls how the Security Police had
suspected her of being a German mole. She is very proud of the fact that
she did not cry during the interrogations: 'In front of Hautojärvi \[the
interrogation officer\] I did not cry'. In the narrative, her resistance
is not just geared towards the interrogation officer, but also towards
the Finnish state, whose security apparatus suspected and humiliated
her. In her upright body, she resists the forces that sought to silence
her.40 [When considering mundane peace, Judith Butler's observation that
[one way of managing populations is to distribute vulnerability among
people unequally]{.mark} is crucial]{.underline}.41
[Biopower]{.underline} -- power that is about managing the births,
deaths, reproduction and illnesses of a population and which is
ultimately utilised by the state ostensibly in the protection of life --
[establishes [a norm]{.mark} that [allows for measurement, evaluation
and hierarchical ranking]{.mark}. As such, it constitutes a mechanism of
control [and distributes vulnerability and invulnerability among the
population]{.mark}]{.underline}.42 In Kaisu's case, her body was
rendered vulnerable -- shaped as that of an outcast -- through the
mechanisms of governance in the post-war Finnish national order. The
vignette demonstrates that [power is multiple and relational, as it
establishes socio-historical relationships that render some bodies more
vulnerable than others. Biopower increases efficiency and capacity at
the level of individual bodies and whole populations, yet it also
distributes vulnerability and invulnerability. This is particularly
acute during times of economic, social and political transformation,
such as peacebuilding and reconstruction, when social relations must be
re-imagined and re-structured.]{.underline} Butler theorises peace and
argues that [peace is a way of indicating one's dependency on others and
being acknowledged. She not only theorises peace as individual
vulnerability but says that it needs to be
institutionalised]{.underline}: [I think that [peace is the active and
difficult resistance to the temptation of war]{.mark}]{.underline}; it
is the prerogative and the obligation of the injured. Peace is something
that has to be vigilantly maintained; i[t is a vigilance, and it
involves temptation, and [it does not mean we as human beings are not
aggressive. It does not mean that we do not have murderous
impulses]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is a mistaken way of understanding
non-violence. . . . [Peace is a certain resistance to the terrible
satisfactions of war. [It's a commitment to living with a certain kind
of vulnerability to others and susceptibility to being wounded that
actually gives our individual lives meaning]{.mark}. . . I think it
needs to be institutionalised. It needs to be part of a community ethos.
I think in fact [it needs to be part of an entire foreign
policy]{.mark}]{.underline}.43 For Butler, therefore[, the [recognition
of vulnerability can lead to more adequate, peaceful responses to
different forms of violence and can counter the tendency to react to
violence with more violence]{.mark}]{.underline}.44 Alyson Cole has
noted that Butler's view on vulnerability paves the way to 'nonviolent
interaffectivity'.45 [[Vulnerability]{.underline}]{.mark} does not, in
this view, imply weakness or inferiority; rather, it [[is a human
condition,]{.mark} 'a basic kind of openness to [being affected and
affecting in both positive and negative ways, which can take diverse
forms]{.mark} in different social situations]{.underline} (for example,
bodily, psychological, economic, emotional, and legal vulnerabilities)',
as Erin Gilson summarises Butler's views.46 Understanding oneself as
vulnerable involves an understanding of the self as shaped by its
relationships to others, the world, power and its environs. [This has,
in my view, implications for the everyday, as our [embodiment and
vulnerability are embedded in the everyday]{.mark} -- in its
historicity, forms of power, materiality and concreteness. Vulnerability
is not just a way of referring to the capacity to be wounded, however.
It is also a 'way of indicating one's dependency on another, a set of
institutions, or a circumambient world to be well, to be safe, to be
acknowledged]{.underline}', argues Butler, in the spirit of early
feminist peace and conflict researchers' work.47 While the vulnerable
body is often thought to be private and non-political, when in contact
with other bodies, the politics of vulnerability comes to the fore --
firstly, in the form of the unequal distribution of vulnerabilities, and
secondly, in the form of accountability, recognition and
acknowledgement. In other words, [t[he way in which vulnerability is
recognised, accounted for, acknowledged and responded to is at the core
of the political. 'The political' is hence an existential relation that
we all live out, on a daily basis, in ways that create, re-produce,
transcend and challenge differences, hierarchies, discriminations and
vulnerabilities]{.mark} between subjectivities and political
positions]{.underline}. Furthermore, [[vulnerable bodies are agentic, as
receptivity, accountability and vulnerability are actually the
presuppositions of agency, not its opposites]{.underline}]{.mark}.48 In
short, vulnerability is enabling for our being in the world; that is,
[[vulnerability is a 'condition of potential that makes possible other
conditions', including peace]{.underline}]{.mark}. It can be argued that
Kaisu's bold appearance in the documentary film was a political event of
claiming back her silenced body and evoking recognition of the existence
of the bodies of her kind. Her vulnerable body thereby carried an
agentic capacity capable of challenging the existing hierarchies,
discriminations and differences. Although vulnerability can be seen as a
shared human condition, it is lived and experienced in different ways,
as well as distributed unequally, as argued above. [The ways in which we
live and are affected can be understood only in light of the
particularity of embodied, social and mundane experiences. It is in this
way that [feminist and critical theorising of the body, the everyday and
vulnerability open up new pathways to re-theorise peace.]{.mark} Peace
is something that becomes expressed and takes place through acts and
points of everyday contact between variously situated and variously
vulnerable bodies -- namely, in corporeal events where accountability,
response-ability, recognition and acknowledgement emerge]{.underline}.
The pluralistic and critical approaches indicated in my agenda are more
sensitive to the changing patterns and dynamics of peace than many
abstract, ontologically solid or violence-dependent approaches.

#### The only choice we have as we mature is how we inhabit our vulnerability, how we become larger and more courageous and more compassionate through our intimacy with disappearance, our choice is to inhabit vulnerability as generous citizens of loss, robustly and fully, or conversely, as misers and complainers, reluctant and fearful, always at the gates of existence, but never bravely and completely attempting to enter, never wanting to risk ourselves, never walking fully through the door.

based bourgeois managerial hegemonic masculinities]{.underline}**
(Connell, 2005b, pp. 84, 76-7; Connell, 2005a, p. 263; Connell and Wood,
2005). In this account **[transnational business masculinity is seen to
occupy the position of hegemonic masculinity on a world
scale]{.underline}**---that is to say, a dominant form of masculinity
that embodies, organizes, and legitimates men's domination in the world
gender order as a whole (Connell, 2000, p. 46). This notion of hegemonic
masculinity is, however, understood as embodying more that just a
Gramscian-style mechanism for gaining consent. Rather, the political
legitimating meaning of hegemonic masculinity quickly slides towards its
meaning as the 'dominant' masculinity and how an actual group of men
'embodies' this dominant positioning, including how this group exhibits
particular personality traits. Connell asserts that '**[world politics
is now more and more organized around the needs of transnational
capital', placing 'strategic power in the hands of particular groups of
men---managers and entrepreneurs'---who self-consciously manage their
bodies and emotions as well as money, and are increasingly detached from
older loyalties to nation, business organisation, family and marital
partners]{.underline}** (Connell, 2005a, p. xxiii; Connell and Wood,
2005, p. 359). Drawing upon Connell's work the sociologist **[Joan Acker
endorses this view that hegemonic masculinities are embodied in the
specific characteristics of multinational business-men suggesting that
we think of 'Rupert Murdoch, Phil Knight or Bill Gates'. Adding
'\[t\]his masculinity is supported and reinforced by the ethos of the
free-market, competition and a "win or die" environment. This is the
masculine image of those who organize and lead the drive to global
control and the opening of markets to international
competition']{.underline}** (Acker 2004, p. 29). **[These men
are]{.underline}**, in Connell's account, **[dispositionally highly
atomistic---competitive and largely distanced from social or personal
commitments. They embody a neo-liberal version of an emphasized
traditional masculinity, without any requirement to direct bodily
strength]{.underline}** (Connell, 2005a, pp. xxiii, 255-6; Connell,
2005b, p. 77).

It is my contention **[that Foucault's "post-Marxist" insights about the
intrinsic link between productive practices of power and forms of the
subject must remain central in our critical analyses of the neoliberal
turn. While in many Marxist accounts neoliberalism is understood simply
as an intensification of capitalist exploitation, which is heightening
the fundamental class antagonism between capitalists and laborers, from
a Foucauldian perspective it must be understood as a new configuration
of power relations that produces new forms of the
subject]{.underline}**. We have to recognize the historically specific
ways that the instability and the persistent crises of capitalism have
been negotiated in recent decades through neoliberal forms of
governmentality -- new political technologies of power and social
regulation. **[Many]{.underline}** socialist **[writers]{.underline}**
have **[lamented that the retreat from class analysis in the academy in
the eighties and nineties was one of neoliberalism's most effective
weapons because it prevented class-consciousness from developing as the
appropriate response to the rise of
neoliberalism]{.underline}**.[\[3\]](http://theoryculturesociety.org/johanna-oksala-on-foucault-marx-and-neoliberal-subjects/#_ftn3)
While the spread of neoliberalism is clearly inseparable from the
structural logic of capitalist accumulation**[, to view the subjects it
produces simply as class subjects who lack the appropriate consciousness
of their situation is nevertheless problematic i]{.underline}**n my
view. While it is important to acknowledge that in his lectures on
neoliberalism, The Birth of Biopolitics(2008), Foucault describes
technologies and rationalities rather than their actual empirical
outcomes, **[empirical and experiential evidence gives weight to the
theoretical claim that the neoliberal reorganization of Western
societies has resulted in new forms of the subject -- a new
understanding of ourselves. Social volatility and economic risks have
become increasingly central for profit making and the financialization
of everyday life requires new kinds of subjects and social
networks]{.underline}** (Floyd 2009, 196). **[Neoliberal governmentality
has dramatically extended the reach of the markets and market
rationality]{.underline}** **[and thereby produced the corresponding
subjects who are compelled to behave as market actors]{.underline}** --
consumers, individual investors and entrepreneurs -- **[across several
dimensions of their lives.]{.underline}** As Foucault shows**[,
neoliberal techniques scramble the traditional opposition between
capitalists and workers in the sense that subjects are increasingly
conceived and conceive themselves as entrepreneurs of the self, who
attempt to maximize their "human capital]{.underline}**". Whether we
focus on the reforms of pension plans and healthcare, revisions of
copyright laws or the restructuring of universities, **[we are
increasingly required to view ourselves as market-actors and to behave
accordingly]{.underline}**.[\[4\]](http://theoryculturesociety.org/johanna-oksala-on-foucault-marx-and-neoliberal-subjects/#_ftn4)
**[These new forms of governmentality and social regulation are
misrecognized insofar as they are identified as "merely" cultural or
superstructural]{.underline}**.[\[5\]](http://theoryculturesociety.org/johanna-oksala-on-foucault-marx-and-neoliberal-subjects/#_ftn5)
**[The historically specific practices of power in which we must engage
daily]{.underline}** in order to go about our lives **[are not
just]{.underline}** symbolic, **[cultural]{.underline}** or discursive
practices **[as Foucault's Marxist critics sometimes
claim.]{.underline}** **[They are essentially material, social and
economic practices that are organized through neoliberal rationality and
embedded in law and political institutions, but also in everyday social
relationships.]{.underline}** Hence, **[we are not confronted merely
with ideological fiction that could be dispelled through the development
of appropriate class-consciousness; we are confronted with a new kind of
social reality.]{.underline}** What the Foucauldian analysis of
neoliberalism downplays in my view, however, is the necessary "failures"
of neoliberal governmentality to constitute entrepreneurial subjects --
the neoliberal constitution of "others**[". The obstacles in the way of
developing class consciousness are also "objective" in the second sense
that we are witnessing other, radically new forms of subjectivation that
are brought about by the global, neoliberal turn]{.underline}**: the
**[unemployed]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}** the **[undocumented
subjects]{.underline}**, **[as well as the neocolonial, disposable
subjects of the global South.]{.underline}** It is widely acknowledged
by numerous socialist writers that the composition of the workforce has
dramatically changed in the last decades due to the globalization and
neoliberalization of our economies. The industrial working class has
been shrinking in all Western countries at a rapid rate, and has been
largely replaced by post-industrial, service-sector workers, who are
largely female and in part-time or precarious employment. Instead of
social relations based on relatively stable forms of wage-labor, the
growth of insecurity and negative flexibilization have come to
increasingly characterize all work. Moreover, **[the majority of the
poorest and the most oppressed people in the world today are not
wage-laborers. They are people who have to eke out a precarious
existence in the informal economy because capitalism appears to have no
use for them at all.]{.underline}** In other words, **[the forms of
exploitation have not only assumed radically new forms, but it has
become increasingly unclear what the class relations are and how we are
situated in their intersections. It is imperative to also theorize these
new forms of the subject and the political potential they hold for
radical social transformation. That requires acknowledging the limits of
both Foucault's analysis of neoliberalism, as well as traditional
Marxist class analysis, and moving beyond them.]{.underline}**

**[It is a hallmark of US neoliberal political life that the more people
are rendered vulnerable and dispensable, the more the state of
vulnerability becomes figured as shameful]{.underline}**. As many have
noted (see, for example, [Centeno and Cohen,
2012](http://www.palgrave-journals.com/pcs/journal/v19/n2/full/pcs20145a.html#bib19)),
**[increased income inequality has led the privileged to rationalize
their privilege, which in turn has led to decreasing empathy for the
poor]{.underline}**. [Lamont
(2000)](http://www.palgrave-journals.com/pcs/journal/v19/n2/full/pcs20145a.html#bib51),
who interviewed white and black working-class men in New York in the
90s, found that **[neoliberal economic realities and the decline of
traditional collective sources of solidarity had rendered white
working-class men quite vulnerable]{.underline}**. **[One way they dealt
with their heightened feelings of vulnerability was to draw boundaries
between the deserving and the undeserving poor, the latter of whom they
associated with blackness]{.underline}** (see also [Wacquant,
2001b](http://www.palgrave-journals.com/pcs/journal/v19/n2/full/pcs20145a.html#bib85)).
Indeed, by the 90s in the US, **[the white imaginary offered two
predominant socially reviled subject positions to poor African
Americans]{.underline}**: the omnipotent male criminal, who terrorizes
vulnerable whites with his nefarious entrepreneurial skills, and his
split-off other side, the female welfare dependent, who, since Reagan,
has held all of the country's disavowed need and has been used as a
signifier of the failures of big government. As I shall argue, **[a
typical form of splitting endemic to neoliberal practices and ideologies
pits omnipotent narcissistic versions of autonomy against degraded
narcissistic versions of dependence. This instance of a racist white
imaginary well exemplifies how a radical split between autonomy and
dependence can be projected seamlessly onto a racialized and gendered
divide.]{.underline}**

and other non-psychoanalytic thinkers focus on neoliberal subjective
practices that demand a shift from comfort with dependence to
repudiation of dependence. In a psychoanalytic frame, however, which
recognizes no possibility of overcoming dependence**[, the task is to
comprehend the psychic effects of a cultural lack of attunement to
dependency needs and a cultural encouragement to split off and project
dependency needs and vulnerability]{.underline}**. Such
**[effects]{.underline}**, as we have seen, **[include intense shame
about dependence]{.underline}** (see [Jimenez and Walkerdine,
2012](http://www.palgrave-journals.com/pcs/journal/v19/n2/full/pcs20145a.html#bib43)),
**[omnipotent versions of autonomy, and narcissistic processes that
include oscillations between grandiosity and self-deprecation with
regard to the self, and idealization and devaluation with regard to the
relation with others]{.underline}**. **[These narcissistic states and
oscillations are motored by the fantasies subtending the fetish
structure of a perverse society that disavows a reality marked by gross
failures of accountability and proper caretaking by those in
authority]{.underline}** ([Layton,
2010](http://www.palgrave-journals.com/pcs/journal/v19/n2/full/pcs20145a.html#bib58)).
T**[he fantasies endemic to narcissistic neoliberal subject formation
are produced in part by the radical split between autonomy and
connection described earlier]{.underline}** (and enacted differently by
different groups): in the autonomy fantasy, we imagine ourselves
self-sufficient and omnipotent, needing no one (the entrepreneurial
self**[); in the fantasy marked by neoliberalism's degraded state of
dependency, we fantasize that we will be loved and taken care of without
having to make any effort]{.underline}**. [Chang and Glynos

logics operates in contemporary UK political culture, issuing in

T**[he \"marriage\" of marxism and feminism has been like the marriage
husband and wife depicted in English common law: marxism and feminism
are one, and that one is Marxism.]{.underline}** **[Recent attempts to
integrate marxism and feminism are unsatisfactory to us as feminists
because they subsume the femi­nist struggle into the \"larger\" struggle
against capi­tal.]{.underline}** To continue our simile further, either
we need a healthier marriage or we need a divorce. The inequalities in
this marriage, like most social phenomena, are no accident. **[Many
marxists typical­ly argue that feminism is at best less important than
class conflict and at worst divisive of the working class. This
political stance produces an analysis that absorbs feminism into the
class struggle]{.underline}**. Moreover, **[the analytic power of
marxism with respect to capital has obscured its limitations with
respect to sexism.]{.underline}** We will argue here that while marxist
analysis provides essential insight into the laws of historical
develop­ment, and those of capital in particular, **[the categories of
marxism are sex-blind.]{.underline}** **[Only a specifically feminist
analysis reveals the systemic character of relations between men and
women.]{.underline}** Yet feminist analysis by itself is inadequate
because it has been blind to his­tory and insufficiency materialist.
**[Both Marxist anal­ysis, particularly its historical and materialist
method, and feminist analysis, especially the identification of
patriarchy as a social and historical structure, must be drawn upon if
we are to understand the development of western capitalist societies and
the predicament of women within them]{.underline}**. In this essay we
suggest a new direction for marxist feminist analysis. I MARXISM AND THE
WOMAN QUESTION The woman question has never been the \"femi­nist
question.\" **[The feminist question is directed at the causes of sexual
inequality between women and men, of male dominance over women. Most
marxist analyses of women\'s position take as their question the
relationship of women to the eco­nomic system, rather than that of women
to men, apparently assuming the latter will be explained in their
discussion of the former. Marxist analysis]{.underline}** of the woman
question has taken three main forms. All **[see women\'s oppression .in
our connection]{.underline}** (or lack of it) **[to
production]{.underline}**, **[Defining women as part of the working
class, these analyses consistently subsume women\'s relation to men
under worker\'s relation to capital]{.underline}**. First, early
marxists, including Marx, Engels, Kautsky, and Lenin, saw capitalism
drawing, all women into the wage labor force, and saw this process
destroying the sexual division, of labor. Second, contemporary marxists
have incor­porated, women into an analysis of evervdav life in
capitalism. In this view, all aspects of our lives are seen to reproduce
the capitalist system and we are all workers in the system. And third,,
marxist femi­nists have focused on housework and its relation to capital,
some arguing that housework produces surplus value and that houseworkers
work directly for capitalists. . . . While the approach of the early
marxists ignored housework and stressed women\'s labor force
par­ticipation, the two more recent approaches em­phasize housework to
such an extent they ignore women\'s current role in the labor market.
Never­theless, **[all three attempt to include women in the category
working class and to understand women\'s oppression as another aspect of
class oppression]{.underline}**. **[In doing so all give short shrift to
the object of feminist analysis, the relations between women and
men.]{.underline}** **[While our \"problems\" have been elegantly
analyzed, they have been misunderstood]{.underline}**. The focus of
Marxist analysis has been class relations; the object of marxist
analysis has been understanding the laws of motion of capitalist
society. While we be­lieve marxist methodology can be used to formulate
feminist strategy, these marxist feminist approaches discussed above
clearly do not do so; their marxism clearly dominates their feminism.
Marxism enables us to understand many as­pects of capitalist societies:
the structure of pro­duction, the generation of a particular occupational
structure, and the nature of the dominant ideology. **[Marx\'s theory of
the development of capitalism is a theory of the development of \"empty
places.\"]{.underline}** Marx predicted, for example, the growth of the
proletariat and the demise of the petit bourgeoisie. More pre­cisely and
in more detail, Braverman among others has explained the creation of the
\"places\" clerical worker and service worker in advanced capitalist
societies.2 **[Just as capital creates these places indifferent to the
individuals who fill them, the cat­egories of marxist analysis, class,
reserve army of labor, wage laborer, do not explain why particular
people, fill particular places. They give no clues about why women are
subordinate to men inside and outside the family and why it is not the
other way around.]{.underline}** **[Marxist categories, like capital
itself, are sex-blind. The categories of Marxism cannot tell us who will
fill the empty places. Marxist analysis of the woman question has
suffered from this basic problem.]{.underline}**

#### Perm -- do both -- enables a recognition that what is shared between the story of Middle Eastern conquest and Native displacement is a vulnerability that props up and defends a paternal American savior

**Lubin 2008** (Alex, Professor of American Studies at the University of
New Mexico, "'We Are All Israelies'" in *South Atlantic Quarterly*)

The comparative imaginaries that have linked the U.S. West to the Orient
reemerge in the George W. Bush administration's desire to "smoke" Osama
Bin Laden "out of his cave."25 The invocation of [the Western drama of
settler colonialism has always animated American thinking about and
activity in the Middle East, and Bush is merely tapping into a well of
affective politics that links the United States to the Middle East as
well as provides sup- port for increased surveillance and the suspension
of rights domestically]{.underline}. Yet, in the contemporary era of
neoliberal globalization, the United States' [comparative rendering of
the Middle East through its own settler colonial past has been
multiplied and transformed into a "global war on terror]{.underline}."
That is, [the United States' unparalleled superpower status enables it
to universalize and globalize its comparative politics into a global
"clash of civilizations]{.underline}."26 Comparisons animate the
contemporary conflict against "terrorism" as U.S. war officials battle
daily to shape the story of the Iraq war by comparing the contemporary
battle against "Islamo-fascism" to the antiracist and anti- Fascist
memory of World War II. In 2007, President Bush inadvertently cautioned
legislators to continue absurdly high rates of war funding so as not to
repeat the mistakes of Vietnam, when, according to Bush, the U.S.
superpower was undermined domestically by an emasculated Left unable to
endure the rigors of war. The comparative turn, hinging on the seem- ing
nobility of World War II and the darkness of Vietnam, illustrates an
uneasy empire's attempt to maintain contradictions in the face of messy
facts on the ground. Yet these comparisons are always fraught and invite
unintended readings. [Comparing]{.underline} Israeli and U.S. **[settler
colonialisms seeks to shatter the patina of
exceptionalism]{.underline}**, as well as the "state of exception," to
use Giorgio Agamben's term, that currently justifies the military,
social, and cultural occupation of the West Bank and Gaza. Indeed,
**[staking a claim for similarity---not exactness---allows us to see
particular sites of state and imperial rule not in isolation but as
constitutive of larger global systems and circuits of
power]{.underline}**.27 Although most settler colonies come to an end
through a suc- cessful anticolonial rebellion or through the absorption
of the settler colony into the mother country, the legacy of colonial
rule in places like the U.S. Southwest continues to haunt the
postcolonial society[. Comparing]{.underline} occu- pied Palestine to
the [postcolonial U.S. Southwest reveals each location in a new light:
we are able to recognize colonial rule in]{.underline} [the Middle
East]{.underline} as well [as the colonial present in the U.S.
Southwest]{.underline}.

#### Imperial violence "here" and "there" represent different intensities of the same ideology

**Maira 2008** (Sunaina, Prof. of Asian American Studies at UC Davis,
Belly-Dancing: Arab Face, orientalist..." in *American Studies*)

In contrast to Britain or France, for example, [the United States did
not have a direct colonial relationship with the Middle East but has had
a history of covert interventions and non-territorially based policies
to assert its political, economic, and military interests and hegemony
in the region]{.underline}, especially since World War II.11
Furthermore, the United States has a long history, since its wars in
Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines in 1898, of "imperialism with-
out colonies" or of "informal empire."12 This [neocolonialist model is
rooted in what some call the strategy of "New Empire,]{.underline}"
promulgated by Theodore Roosevelt and other early twentieth century
figures who wanted to expand U.S. economic and military power without
the burden---and stigma---of administering overseas colonies.13 However,
Neil Smith argues that 1898 [was **not a sharp break between "formal"
and "informal" modes of empire, but rather a transition in evolving
forms of U.S. expansionism that continued to use territorialized forms
of domination, globally and also domestically (confining Native
Americans; enslaving African Americans; and importing Asian, Latin
American, and Arab labor**]{.underline}).14 This imperial expansion and
[conquest of new geographic and cultural frontiers was accompanied by
the appropriation and exploration of "other" cultures, which shaped the
crafting of a distinctly "American" national identity. Images of the
"Orient" and processes of cultural appropriation are key to the everyday
cultures of U.S. imperialism and imperial feelings, for they have long
provided Americans with "opportunities for creating selves and settings
of aesthetic appeal and social charisma" and with a "foil for the
'progress' that many Americans so assiduously pursued as their
birthright and destiny]{.underline}."15 [Orientalist images]{.underline}
of Muslim "infidels" and "barbaric" Arabs have histori- cally permeated
U.S. popular culture, [**providing an antithesis for American national
identity and helping to legitimate U.S. imperial expansion and racial**
domination]{.underline}, including its interventions and support for
colonialist projects in the Middle East. American Orientalization of
Muslims and Arabs has a long history that can be traced to the
foundational Holy Land myths of the Christian settlers and the U.S.
Navy's war with the Barbary states (early "terrorists" in the
Mediterranean) in the 1780s.16 During the late nineteenth and early
twentieth centuries, the United States ventured into trade with the
Middle East during what Mark Twain described as the "Gilded Age," and
American missionaries, tourists, and merchants contributed to racist as
well as romanticized notions of the "Orient" that was imagined as
"exotic" as well as "backward."17 These stereotypes crystallized in
archives of American Orientalism that were shaped by historical events,
including U.S. support for the Balfour Declaration of 1917 and the
creation of the state of Israel in the Middle East in 1948, the
overthrow of Mossadegh in Iran and installation of the Shah in 1953, the
attack on Beirut in 1958, the OPEC oil crisis of the 1970s, the American
hostage crisis of 1979, and the two wars on Iraq.18 Strikingly, the
repertoire of American Orientalism has remained relatively stable as
U.S. strategic, economic, and political interests in the Middle East
have drawn it more deeply into the region.

## Academy

### Feminism Specific

#### We can use educational forums and research to solve for structural issues and the issues in the Academy

**Lynch 1999** (Kathleen, University of Dublin, The Economic and Social
Review, Vol. 30, No. 1, January, 1999, pp. 41-69)

[Feminist scholars have been especially effective in challenging the
core epistemological and methodological assumptions of mainstream social
scientific practice]{.underline}. They have challenged patterns of bias
in research design, including the absence of research on questions of
central importance to women; the focus on elitest research topics; the
naive understanding of objectivity; the improper interpretation and
overgeneralisation of findings; and inadequate data dissemination
(Jayaratne and Stewart, 1995, p. 218). [Not only have feminist theorists
been to the fore in the critique of positivism, they have also been
leaders in developing a theory of emancipatory action through education
and research]{.underline} ( Harding, 1987; Humphries and Truman, 1994;
Lather, 1991; Lentin, 1993; Mies, 1984; Smith, 1987; Stanley and Wise,
1983; Weiler, 1988[). They have encouraged]{.underline} women to engage
in [action both in and through education, and through
research]{.underline}; they have also attempted to document the type of
the procedures which must be followed in order to create an emancipatory
research approach. Lather claims that: 52 THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL REVIEW
\... the development of emancipatory social theory requires an empirical
stance which is open-ended, dialogically reciprocal, grounded in respect
for human capacity, and yet profoundly sceptical of appearances and
"common sense". Such an empirical stance is, furthermore, rooted in a
commitment to the long-term, broad-based ideological struggle to
transform structural inequalities (Lather, 1986, p. 269). [The challenge
posed by critical and feminist theories for research in terms of
reflexivity, dialogue and co-operation with marginalised people, are
considerable. An even greater challenge is how to establish
collaborative practices between theorist/researcher and marginalised
peoples which will ensure that the understandings arrived at can work
towards a transformative outcome. To confront the latter challenge is to
confront the forces of interest within the academy itself.]{.underline}

### AT: vagueness bad

#### Their obsession with blueprinted methods and separation of the theoretical from the material crowds out nuance and leaves the judge to default to normative Western modes of adjudicating critical thought -- vote aff to subvert the university's imperative for clarity

**Hoofd 17** \[Ingrid M. Hoofd (2017) "Higher Education and
Technological Acceleration: The Disintegration of University Teaching
and Research" Palgrave Macmillan, New York,
https://doi.org/10.1057/978-1-137-51409-7\]//jz

Several years ago, the media and communications programme in NUS saw the
need for an ethics module, and I was invited to create and teach this
module. That this course became mandatory within this particular
programme is, in light of the connection I outlined in Chap. 1between
communication technologies and academic acceleration, no surprise: the
integration of more and more complex media technology into society
creates a host of new ethical dilemmas, and students, so the argument
goes, should be taught how to manage these dilemmas and technologies in
their 'real' jobs after university. This argument is of course not
unique to this particular university. [The shift from an industrial
social order towards a society marked by new media technologies has
resulted in a proliferation of debates and agendas on the teaching of
moral guidelines in academia and other educational institutions, and in
many ways follows Ortega y Gasset's call to teach the students what they
need to know by way of imparting only that cultural and moral knowledge
that may function as a 'method' or roadmap]{.underline}. At Utrecht
University, for instance, the Media and Culture Department in the
Humanities Faculty at which I currently teach has attempted to heed
students' needs by responding to the advice from an external visiting
committee demanding more transparency in teaching. The Department did so
by implementing the requirement that end goals and methods are made
explicit in module syllabi and student theses, and that courses are to
focus on the transmission of clear skills rather than 'obscure theory.'
But [while such attempts at transparency are seemingly well meant and
generous to the students, they ultimately divorce methods]{.underline}
IDEALISTIC SELF-DELUSIONS AND THE LIMITS OF NOSTALGIA 73and skills [from
their grounding theoretical (and hence always subjective) perspectives,
much like Ortega y Gasset implies that the teaching of mere 'roadmaps'
is an ultimately neutral or positive affair]{.underline}. [Methods, as
its etymology indeed suggests, are convenient roadmaps in Ortega y
Gasset's sense, but are always specifi c to a certain theoretical
tradition and hence can always be questioned for their
limitations.]{.underline} What is more, [the emphasis on methods seems
to arise from a fear of the confusion and partial subjectivity of
student assessment on the basis of the inter-subjective teacher--
student relationship within a certain tradition, and hence appears as an
attempt to stamp out the 'noise' emanating from the Lyotardian 'demise
of great narratives' in the postmodern European context]{.underline}.
[This obsession with methods can therefore be interpreted as akin to the
onslaught of cybernetics and quantifi cation, which seeks to suppress
the complications of thinking as dialectical in the university at large
from the larger speedelitist context which this cybernetic machinery
serves.]{.underline} Staff and student work in turn increasingly
resembles a fi nally immoral---because blind to its reproduction of
inequalities---form of automated production and an ever more hastily
churning out of research and writing. Student theses, for instance,
having to bow to the demands of a standardised assessment form in which
supposedly crucial aspects of the thesis are presented as separate
entities (for instance, [the method employed needs to be rendered
explicit and is assessed separately from the theoretical framework in
the form), leads to narrow 'assembly-line' write-ups that merely seek to
'tick the boxes' without any critical or holistic considerations around
rhetoric and perspective]{.underline}. More disturbingly, [students that
attempt a more daring or original piece of writing for their theses tend
to get penalised when, for instance, not explicitly stating the method
employed, even if management claims that the form is not meant to be
prescriptive]{.underline}. This deplorable practice is therefore
reminiscent of the 'drilling' and disciplining of the student (and the
lecturer or supervisor), as the compulsory transparency of goals and
methods lead to a situation that becomes completely blind and
disrespectful to how the outcome of the pedagogical student--teacher
relationship can and should never be fully known in advance in order to
remain a scene of insightful transformation for the student and teacher
away from the cybernetic compulsion of the neoliberal economy. In other
words, [if the pedagogical scene wishes to be as hospitable and
promissory as possible so that radically new understandings may emerge
(and the student can truly grow), it is imperative that module goals
remain partly oblique and emergent, and that methods]{.underline} 74
I.M. HOOFDare [always also questioned and unpacked for their partial and
subjective (often European and masculine) theoretical underpinnings and
traditions]{.underline}. After all, the term '[theory' is derived from
the Greek θεωρειν or 'being a spectator in a theatre,' and hence always
implies not only a partial or subjective position, but also an element
of contextual inter-subjectivity.]{.underline} The formulation of strict
methods is therefore one particular instance of a problematic
transcendence via an erasure of the non-neutral grounds of theory. The
faculty examination board at Utrecht thus attempts to 'eliminate the
noise' of teacher and student subjectivity and respond to the demands of
the market, while failing to understand that not only such
inter-subjective 'noise' is precisely what makes teaching, learning, and
pedagogical communication possible, but also that the main 'culture' of
the humanities traditionally is one of questioning methods and
critiquing all forms of non-neutral automation in order to invite a
radically different future. [The acceleration of the aporia can
therefore be keenly felt around these pedagogical demands from the
management (and beyond) as well as in my supervision and teaching at
Utrecht University; an increasingly unsure student body demand being
taught ever clearer 'methods' and 'skills,' while at the same time, some
of these students get ever more self-doubting and even display a
recalcitrance with the university as such, being unsure how to properly
understand their own fears and doubts as a logical product of the
aporetic demands the university and the lecturer makes on
them]{.underline}. What is more, the rendering transparent of methods
and goals while eliding the controversies underlying them has in many
cases the paradoxical outcome of making the students understand less, as
they, for instance, logically cannot comprehend why all the great texts
of the humanities tend not to have an explicit methods section, while
they have to focus so much on methods in their theses. Eventually
therefore, this attempt at complete transparency does the students and
the staff a disservice, even if it seems to dutifully cater to their
needs and uses. Interestingly also, [while the harking back to the
teaching of theoretical traditions in media studies may seem an antidote
to the obsession with clear methods and roadmaps, the acceleration of
the aporia emerges even stronger in such well-meant attempts to rethink
the pedagogical scene as one of Bildung via theoretical---yet eventually
also largely white and masculine---culture]{.underline}. In order to
counter the obsession with methods and end goals, several of my
colleagues and I at Utrecht University set up a task force for
rethinking student assessment and pedagogical goals. Our line of
reasoning largely is that a more appropriate and generous teaching and
IDEALISTIC SELF-DELUSIONS AND THE LIMITS OF NOSTALGIA 75assessment
should instead focus on the teaching of the main grounds, theories, and
traditions in the humanities at large, so that an ethic of critique and
questioning can once more be foregrounded in the media and culture
curriculum, as it was in the past. While this at least [allows the
students to address methods and texts in a critical fashion, the
question of course remains whether such a revision---while certainly
remaining more hospitable to subjective student and staff otherness than
the blind quest for objective module transparency and methodological
automation---not also remains wedded to a nostalgic and ultimately
problematic Enlightenment agenda. Such a nostalgia for the grounds of
(critical) theory hence also appears as a complicit product of the
acceleration of higher education, insofar it also performs the
Janus-faced logic of academic optimism in light of larger social
desperation.]{.underline} What is more, [the art of
critique]{.underline} (which comes from the Greek κρινειν or 'to
separate') also [requires that aspects are split out or distinguished
from one another---left from right, East from West, and neo-liberal from
liberal---whereas such divisions are nonetheless intimately entangled
with and constitutive of one another, so that technological conditions
that collapse the semiotic and functionalist spheres, the simulated
playing out of such illusory differences lead to their accelerated
reproduction]{.underline}. The problem is thus one of conceiving a truly
radical form of questioning or critique by looking closer at the
'theatrical' aspect of θεωρειν, while admitting that such a questioning
itself performs such theatricality just as much. It is for this reason
that, for instance, Gary Genosko addresses the problem of radical theory
in Baudrillard's work as similar to the problem of how to conceive of
'political theatre' in "The Drama of Theory," about which more in Chap.
5 . So in short[, I suggest that the debates and agendas that see the
solution in a rigorous implementation of moral or methodological
roadmaps almost always concern the issue of how to teach a form of refl
ection fi t to deal with the moral confusion and supposed 'loss of
values and direction']{.underline} (in line with Ortega y Gasset's
lament of fragmentation) due to the arrival of the information age; any
illusion of grounding university teaching in some superior European
cultural and theoretical tradition runs the risk of closing off
alterity, so that it must also question its own grounds. This
also becomes clear in the ethics course I had to set up for the
communications programme in Singapore, to which I will now turn.

### affect inevitable/necessary/RC

#### Neoliberalism is an affective event -- in order to challenge it, our resistance must be affective too

**Zembylas 19** \[Michalinos Zembylas (2019): The affective dimension of
everyday resistance: implications for critical pedagogy in engaging with
neoliberalism's educational impact, Critical Studies in Education, DOI:

[Resistance is a central concept of the social sciences -- a concept
that has been widely used in feminist, cultural, poststructural,
postcolonial and critical theories]{.underline} (Johansson & Vinthagen,
2016). Despite its extensive use, however, there is considerable
disagreement and ambiguity as to what exactly it denotes (Hollander &
Einwohner, 2004, p. 549). In their frequently cited review of the origin
and status of the concept in the social sciences, Hollander and
Einwohner point out that resistance has been used in diverse, imprecise
and contradictory ways. One can make a similar argument about critical
pedagogy, namely, that [the use of the concept of resistance in this
field has also been diverse and contradictory]{.underline}, depending on
the theoretical framework within which resistance has been framed (e.g.
see Kirylo, 2013). It is safe to argue, then, that [there is no unified
way of defining resistance in critical pedagogy besides a general
understanding of this concept as individual or collective acts of
opposition, yet what constitutes opposition is not always
clear]{.underline}. While debates in the social sciences over the
meaning and implications of the concept of resistance have proliferated
in recent years, one aspect that has not been adequately explored is the
notion of affect (Hynes, 2013). As Hynes has pointed out, CONTACT

trading as Taylor & Francis Group since Hollander and Einwohner
published their review in 2004 [there have been significant shifts in
social theory, and most notably affect theory, that call for a
reconceptualization of what counts as resistance. 'Affect' can generally
be understood as relational and embodied intensities that circulate as
'forces of encounter'; in this sense, affect encompasses and exceeds
more individualized conceptions of emotion (Seigworth & Gregg, 2010).
What has conventionally been termed 'resistance', then, may be
reconceptualized in terms of a flux of affects that produces political
effects which challenge understandings of power or control]{.underline}
(Deleuze & Guattari, 1987). Hence, [recognizing the affective dimension
of resistance complements earlier understandings of power and resistance
on the basis of a simplistic opposition of human agency and social
structure.]{.underline} As Alldred and Fox (2017) suggest: '[power and
resistance are differing aspects of the affective flux between relations
in particular assemblages; all events are consequently sites in which
both "power" and "resistance" may be discerned']{.underline} (p. 1170).
In other words, it is suggested that [there is need to pay attention to
resistance as an affective event, rather than merely as an individual or
collective acts of opposition. In particular, resistance against
neoliberal reforms in education]{.underline} -- e.g. high stakes
testing, accountability, standards, and audit regimes (Giroux, 2008;
McLaren & Farahmandpur, 2005; Taubman, 2009) -- [involves significant
affective repercussions for teachers and students]{.underline}
(Zembylas, 2018b; Bialostok & Aronson, 2016; Hanley, 2015; Moffatt et
al., 2018). [While there are many definitions of neoliberalism,
generally it denotes emphases on productivity, economic liberalization
policies, and the significance of the individual]{.underline} (see
Springer, Birch, & MacLeavy, 2016). [Neoliberalism itself, then, is an
affective event, as collective affects emerging from neoliberal policies
and practices (e.g. fear, anxiety, anger) are inextricable aspects of
the sites, networks and flows of neoliberalism in societies]{.underline}
(Anderson, 2014, 2016). Scholars of critical pedagogy have analyzed the
pedagogies of the neoliberal project, whose aim is to produce apolitical
consumers and future citizens (Odysseos & Pal, 2018), yet the affective
dimension of resistance against neoliberalism's educational impact has
not been adequately theorized. The main objective of this article, then,
is to discuss the affective dimension of resistance in critical pedagogy
in a way that would recognize neoliberalism's affective repercussions.
[The point is not merely to show that affect is involved in the
emergence of resistance in critical pedagogy, but rather to expand the
articulation of resistance in neoliberal education through the lens of
affect theory]{.underline}. Specifically, I am interested in theorizing
[how critical pedagogy can cultivate 'everyday' or 'invisible' acts of
resistance]{.underline} (Scott, 1985, 1989, 1990) [that constitute forms
of 'counter-conduct']{.underline} (Foucault, 2009) in ways that
acknowledge, engage with, and further enhance teachers' and students'
critical engagement with the affective aspects of resistance and
neoliberalism.1 In other words, I theoretically bring together critical
pedagogy, affect, everyday resistance, and counter-conduct to examine
the following questions: [How might we understand resistance in critical
pedagogy as a form of affective work? What are the pedagogical
implications of recognizing the affective dimension of resistance,
particularly in relation to cultivating counter-conductive practices
towards neoliberalism?]{.underline}

#### Their understanding of resistance refuses an analysis through affect theory -- this dooms their movement to failure as they fall victim to the psychic impacts of neoliberal violence

In this section, I briefly illustrate how [resistance is an affective
movement of becoming, rather than an individual act, with consequences
for students' and educators' bodies, theory, research and practice in
education]{.underline}. [While others have acknowledged the role of
emotions and affect in making sense of how neoliberal changes in
education are experienced by students and educators]{.underline} (e.g.
see Bialostok & Aronson, 2016; Hanley, 2015; Moffatt et al., 2018), [my
illustrations]{.underline} -- which come from my own research over the
years (e.g. Zembylas, 2010, 2015, 2018b, 2018c; Bozalek & Zembylas,
2018) -- [intend to demonstrate not only how neoliberal policies in
education use affects (e.g. fear, anxiety) to produce certain
subjectivities]{.underline} (e.g. see Finn, 2016; McKenzie, 2017;
Sellar, 2015; Staunæs, 2011), [but also how educators and students
engage in micro-political movements of affective
resistance.]{.underline} To do so, [I am using the idea of policy
prolepsis introduced by Webb and Gulson (2012) as a methodological tool
to identify the particular ways neoliberal policies in education induce
and prompt particular behaviors and desires in educators and
students.]{.underline}2 Policy prolepses, according to Webb and Gulson,
are a category of becoming-policy that shape policy interpretations and
practices within the spaces of desired, yet incomplete, policy
initiatives and interpretations. '[Policy prolepses operate through
affective tones' (ibid., p. 91) and 'are coded affectively' (ibid., p.
92), positioning policy interpretations as well as subjects
themselves]{.underline}. What follows, then, are two brief illustrations
of policy prolepsis that show the complexities of affective resistance
produced in neoliberal education and its implications. [The first
example is concerned with how the becoming-policy of standardized
professional standards in schools operates affectively in paradoxical
and unexpected ways; the second example is concerned with identifying
the ambivalent affective assemblages of educators' and students'
resistance against neoliberal policies at the university level. In the
first example, it is shown how the politics of standardized professional
standards in schools instill fear, anxiety, stress and anger in
teachers, who generate]{.underline} 8 M. ZEMBYLAS [micro-political ways
of resisting the affective atmospheres invoking normalization of
teachers' pedagogies]{.underline} (see Zembylas, 2010, 2018b). For
example, **[teachers engage in false compliance, agreeing at a
rhetorical level with some aspects of professional standards, while
resisting them in practice or denouncing standards in small circles of
trusted colleagues]{.underline}**. Importantly, [teachers acknowledge
the emotional ambivalence of engaging in false compliance: the
assemblages of fear and anxiety on the one hand, and the affective
atmospheres of solidarity with colleagues, on the other.]{.underline}
Clearly, [resistance is not always progressive or emancipatory, as
teachers themselves often recognize that their subjectivities are caught
up in the affective conditions created by such policy interventions,
producing tensions, paradoxes and ambivalences in their lives. One may,
in fact, explore the numerous (anticipated and unanticipated)
micro-political ways of resistance by teachers that might change the
rhythms of schooling, producing alternative affective spaces that
sometimes enable new embodied encounters and relations]{.underline}
(e.g. between teachers and students or between teachers and their
colleagues), [while other times simply reinforce the negative atmosphere
of fear or anger. Illuminating the counter-conductive elements of
teachers' resistances can reveal more specifically how counter-conduct
is always prone to the entanglement of governing and surveillance
practices]{.underline} (Odysseos & Pal, 2018). Hence, teachers'
affective resistance towards standardizing processes in schools finds
itself caught between a negative affective atmosphere (e.g. fear or
anger) that could be reproduced and, at the same time, the production of
new and unexpected ways of resistance against the material and affective
forces that impinge on teachers' bodies. In all of these different
possibilities, [an analysis of the affective dimension of resistance
requires that we focus upon the micro-politics of the (intended and
unintended) affective assemblages in which teachers are a part of. My
second example pertains to university students' protests in 2015 and
2016 against neoliberal and colonial education policies in South Africa,
calling for decolonizing higher education and greater access to
education, which has resulted in disruptions of examinations and
academic program]{.underline}s (Zembylas, 2018c; Luescher & Klemenčič,
2016; Nyamnjoh, 2016; Pillay, 2016).3 [I want to draw attention to
students' collective affects (e.g. anger) which circulated through
affective economies that operated across universities in the Western
Cape]{.underline} (Bozalek & Zembylas, 2018). [Collective affects were
invigorated by a growing protest against neoliberal and colonial
policies in higher education. The anger instilled in students by such
policies was transmitted onto local university communities by
circulating images of protests through the media]{.underline}. In
particular, protests have become a prominent feature of public and
university life in South Africa. [The process of students' occupation of
university premises, in some cases, and the visibility it gave,
especially through violence and the damages caused to university
property, made it a transfiguring moment in the lives of the
participants and the local community]{.underline}. Hence, there were
voices who acknowledged their concomitant responsibility as a result of
performing damage to public property that cost considerable amounts of
money at a time of scarcity of resources. In our research, for example,
[there were students and educators who noted how, and in which ways,
their subjectivities were produced within assemblages that included
ambivalent affective economies -- on the one hand, an assemblage of
anger against neoliberal policies; on the other hand]{.underline},
CRITICAL STUDIES IN EDUCATION 9 [an assemblage of disappointment and
skepticism for the use of violence as a form of protest, thus
questioning the moral legitimacy of (violent) resistance.]{.underline}
Counter-conduct offers a compelling concept to understand the form of
students' protests as refusals of subjectivities and as acts of
disobedience against being conducted as 'consumer-students' (Odysseos &
Pal, 2018). However, [the framework of counter-conduct, also allows us
to grasp counter-conducts as affective mechanisms that may either forge
new ways of resisting neoliberal policies or could become co-opted by
the politics of violence]{.underline}. [Through this tension, it is
shown that there are ambivalent affective atmospheres circulating in
counter-conductive practices of students and educators that could
neither be 'simply oppositional nor always fully articulated as part of
a clear and long-term strategy of resistance]{.underline}' (Odysseos &
Pal, 2018, p. 17). [These observations illuminate the affective
ambivalence and paradoxicality of resistance against neoliberal
policies; in other words, there are limitations in resistance efforts
that signal clearly that such attempts may end in failure, possibly
reproducing the risks that neoliberalism preys upon. This brief
illustration also shows that any such analysis needs to remain attuned
to exploring neoliberal policies in education as complex affective sites
of producing and contesting subjectivities of students and educators --
sites that are open to evading, resisting and redirecting neoliberal and
colonial imperatives]{.underline} (Odysseos & Pal, 2018).

My analysis has shown that [whatever form neoliberalism is taken to be
in schools and universities, the neoliberal present has important
affective implications.]{.underline} [The affective economies of
neoliberalism that are produced in schools and universities create
particular 'capacities to affect and be affected' for teachers and
students alike. It is thus extremely important to develop methodological
and theoretical tools that critically trace the capacities of teachers
and students for affecting and being affected in their engagements and
negotiations with neoliberal education, and specifically how these
capacities are normalized, embodied or enable alternative
counter-practices]{.underline} (Zembylas, 2018b). Hence, what is
required is a continued critical engagement with neoliberalism's
educational impact in ways that take into consideration the affective
potentialities of resistance. Considering the affective potentialities
of resistance in critical pedagogy can be the starting point for
alternatives visions of educational policies and practices that
challenge forms of neoliberal education. I would argue, then, that [what
is needed in the study of resistance in critical pedagogy is what
Thrift]{.underline} (2008) [calls a micro-biopolitical
approach]{.underline} (Thrift, 2008) which [understands the complexities
and ambivalences of neoliberal affects and norms that operate at the
mundane, ordinary, and everyday level in schools and universities and
the consequences that are produced]{.underline} (Zembylas, 2018b). This
micro-biopolitical approach on conceptualizing resistance in critical
pedagogy is valuable not only because [it pays attention to the
affective consequences of mechanisms and techniques of neoliberal
education in schools and universities, but also because it invokes
what]{.underline} Braidotti (2013) terms '[affirmative
critique']{.underline} (see also Staunæs, 2016). An affirmative critique
in critical pedagogy, for example, is [the sort of critical engagement
with ideas]{.underline} 10 M. ZEMBYLAS and things [that creates
affective spaces for alternative counter-conduct practices against
neoliberal education]{.underline}. In other words, [recognizing the
affective dimension of resistance in critical pedagogy creates openings
for an affirmative critique that has the potential to transform
teachers' and students' capacities to affect and be
affected]{.underline}. In considering the approach I am suggesting here
to affect and resistance in critical pedagogy, one can indeed raise
several questions and concerns such as: [How may critical pedagogy
itself function as an 'apparatus of power']{.underline} (Anderson, 2014)
[which uses affect to mobilize resistance towards certain ideologies or
structures such as neoliberalism? How are these mobilizations of
resistance connected to broader collective conditions and processes of
resisting certain ideologies or structures at the macro-political level?
How do teachers' and students' practices and bodily capacities reproduce
or enrich certain mobilizations of resistance through their encounters?
How can those practices and bodily capacities be reproductive, adaptive
or resistant, whether intentionally or not]{.underline}? (e.g. see
McKenzie, 2017). There are no definitive answers to these questions, but
they must be posed to show the complexities and ambivalences emerging
from attempts to link affect and resistance in critical pedagogy. Hence,
I would argue that [any viable theorization of resistance in critical
pedagogy must not be limited to 'conventional' understandings of
resistance but must emphasize how affects condition the ways
neoliberalism emerges, circulate and are transformed by forms of
resistance waged by teachers and students.]{.underline} Greater
acknowledgment of the ways in which schools and universities play a
fundamental role in the affective conduct of individuals, encouraging
and directing the self-perceptions, economic behavior and
socio-political actions of students, citizens, and workers (Odysseos &
Pal, 2018) will renew theorization of resistance in critical pedagogy in
two ways. First, [by gesturing toward the particular ways in which
affects come to have force and socio-political significance, critical
pedagogy disconnects resistance from a psychologized perspective or a
perspective that defines resistance in dualistic terms as a matter of
either human agency or social structure]{.underline}. This would mean,
for instance, **[recognizing that resistance is not a set of
individualized actions but rather it is very much embedded in the
affective infrastructures of neoliberal education]{.underline}**. To
create renewed affective relations and assemblages as counter-conduct in
schools and universities, then, would essentially mean to [invent new
affective practices that instigate empowerment and resistance against
the various manifestations of neoliberal education]{.underline}. As
Alldred and Fox (2017) conclude: [It is therefore more accurate to see
power and resistance as dual fluxes that permeate all assemblages, a
shifting balance that is never finally settled. Defining a certain
affect as an assertion of power or an effort at resistance is less
important than assessing the capacities that these affects
produce]{.underline}. (p. 1171) For example, it is argued that
'[affective solidarity' is necessary for a sustainable politics of
transformation]{.underline} (Hemmings, 2012). Hemmings proposes an
approach that moves away from rooting transformation in politics of
identity and towards [modes of engagement that start from the affective
dissonance experience can produce.]{.underline} Although affective
dissonance with the experience of neoliberalism's educational impact,
for instance, cannot guarantee a resistant mode, 'that sense of
dissonance might become a sense of injustice and then a desire to
rectify that' (Hemmings, 2012, CRITICAL STUDIES IN EDUCATION 11 p. 157).
The [recognition of affective dissonance as the point of departure for a
possible affective solidarity among teachers and student highlights that
**affective dissonance with neoliberalism's educational impact may be a
productive basis from which to seek solidarity with others -- not based
on a shared identity or ideology, but on feeling the desire for
transforming the injustices inflicted by neoliberal policies and
practices**]{.underline}. Second, the recognition of the affective
dimension of resistance in critical pedagogy helps us understand the
affective present in and beyond schools and universities as a series of
processes and practices in 'the everyday' in which the focus is on the
actions that are mobilized to produce something rather than on their
representations or what they supposedly mean. By examining the
consequences of affects at the micropolitical level, resistance can be
understood in terms of the ways actions produce capacities to affect and
be affected, that is, 'in terms of the forces circulating in assemblage
and the consequent capacities that are produced in assembled relations,
including human bodies and subjectivities' (Alldred & Fox, 2017, p.
1171). Calling upon [theoretical insights in critical pedagogy that
recognize and examine the affective dimension of everyday resistance is
likely to challenge the 'invisible' infrastructures of neoliberal
education in schools and universities.]{.underline} All in all, the call
for a critical pedagogy to acknowledge the affective dimension of
resistance marks an important and necessary moment that allows critical
pedagogy to be further enriched in attempts to address the challenges
faced by teachers and students in neoliberal education. Schools and
universities are at a critical juncture whether and how they will be
able to develop pedagogies and ideas that neither return to an
idealized, pre-neoliberal past, nor expect a sudden revolution but
instead resist against the self-formations involved by neoliberalism
(Odysseos & Pal, 2018). What I have offered here is an attempt to
illuminate the affective dimension of resistance and its implications
for critical pedagogy through theoretical insights that enhance
individual and collective capacity for counter-conduct in neoliberal
contexts. [Being attentive to the complexities and potential
ambivalences in teachers' and students' forms of resistance enhances our
analysis of how critical pedagogy more broadly, and schools and
universities more specifically, are themselves implicated in
transformations of neoliberal education]{.underline} (Odysseos & Pal,
2018).

## AT: Anti-Blackness

#### Systems of power are interlocking and forcing competition links to white masculine rationality

**Collins, 1990**[.]{.underline} (Patricia Hill Collins, Associate
Professor of African American Studies, University of Cincinnati, Black
Feminist Thought: Knowledge, consciousness, and the politics of
empowerment, 1990, p. 225)

[Additive models of oppression are firmly rooted in the either/or
dichotomous thinking of Eurocentric, masculinist thought.]{.underline}
One must be either Black or white in such thought systems -- persons of
ambiguous racial and ethnic identity constantly battle with questions
such as "what are you, anyway?" [This emphasis on quantification and
categorization occurs in conjunction with the belief that either/or
categories must be ranked. The search for certainty of this sort
requires that one side of a dichotomy be privileged while its other is
denigrated. Privilege becomes defined in relation to its
other.]{.underline} [Replacing additive models of oppression with
interlocking ones creates possibilities for new paradigms. The
significance of seeing race, class, and gender as interlocking systems
of oppression is that such an approach fosters a paradigmatic shift of
thinking inclusively about other oppressions, such as age, sexual
orientation, religion, and ethnicity. Race, class and gender represent
the three systems of oppression that most heavily affect
African-American women. But these systems and the economic, political,
and ideological conditions that support them may not be the most
fundamental oppressions, and they certainly affect many more groups than
Black women. Other people of color, Jews, the poor, white women, and
gays and lesbians have all had similar ideological justifications
offered for their subordination. All categories of humans labeled Others
have been equated to one another, to animals, and to nature]{.underline}
(Halpin 1989). [Placing African-American women and other excluded groups
in the center of analysis opens up possibilities for a both/and
conceptual stance, one in which all groups possess varying amounts of
penalty and privilege in one historically created system.]{.underline}
In this system, for example, white women are penalized by their gender
but privileged by their race. Depending upon the context, an individual
may be an oppressor, a member of an oppressed group, or simultaneously
oppressor and oppressed.

#### Violence against the black body occurs through a process of [socialization]{.underline} that [goes beyond race]{.underline} -- must examine the role gender plays 

**Martinot 7** (Steve, Adjunct Instructor at San Francisco State
University,He has been a human rights, union, and community activist for
most of his life.\" Motherhood and the Invention of Race,\" Hypatia
22.2, 79-97, Project Muse))

An article in The Nation from December 3, 2003, entitled
\"[Criminalizing Motherhood]{.underline},\" tells an old story. It is
the story of a prosecution, now considered by the state as a precedent;
yet it [reveals a social logic that has long inhabited U.S.
jurisprudence and which the state continues to rehearse and
perform]{.underline}. [In the cold clang of its historically practiced
procedure, that logic is at once recalled and forgotten as a principle
governing the United States since its inception.]{.underline} Regina
McKnight is doing twelve years in prison for a stillbirth, carving out a
dangerous intersection between the drug war and the anti-choice
movement. In the eyes of the South Carolina Attorney General\'s office,
McKnight committed murder. Her crime? Giving birth to a five-pound,
stillborn baby. As McKnight grieved and held her third daughter
Mercedes\' lifeless body, she could never have imagined that she was
about to become the first woman in America convicted of murder by using
cocaine while pregnant. \[End Page 79\] The absence of any scientific
research linking cocaine use to stillbirth didn\'t matter. Nor did it
matter that the state couldn\'t conclusively prove that McKnight\'s
cocaine use actually caused Mercedes\' stillbirth. What mattered was
that South Carolina prosecutors were hell-bent on using McKnight as an
example. Thanks largely to the efforts of the former Republican Attorney
General, Charlie Condon, now running for U.S. Senate, South Carolina is
the only state in the nation with a child-abuse law that can be applied
to \"viable fetuses.\" . . . McKnight, now 26, was the first to be
imprisoned on a murder conviction under the \"viable fetuses\" law. In
October McKnight lost her best shot at release when the Supreme Court
decided not to review the case, allowing the conviction to stand by
default. (Talvi 2003, 4) The article only allusively suggests that
McKnight is black, but it does mention that she is a seasonal tobacco
worker, homeless, and at the time of her pregnancy, grieving the death
of her own mother, who was run over by a truck. [For white
jurisprudence, it is neither her homeless exposure to the elements, nor
the malnutrition attendant upon underpaid agricultural labor, nor the
exhaustion of long work hours, that took her baby\'s life, but a toke in
an unguarded moment]{.underline}. It is not the health of the mother
that the state is concerned with; the provision of better labor
protections and conditions would have directly enhanced the baby\'s
biological well being. And neither is it McKnight\'s misery, since that
is precisely what the state uses against her by prosecuting her for drug
use rather than providing her with prenatal medical care. Whatever
defense she might have wished to offer concerning her homelessness, her
bereavement, or the duress of her daily toil, were discounted in
advance. McKnight\'s health is an extraneous concern and her humanity
irrelevant. Yet insofar as the state has shown no interest in the health
or viability of either mother or child, its juridical concept of
\'viable fetus\' becomes simply a rhetorical device to deliver women
into the thrall of its control, to render them functions of the state.
In prosecuting McKnight, the state\'s agenda is to use motherhood to
control women and to mark the difference of race. [The state\'s control
of women\'s]{.underline} pregnant [bodies has a strong racial
component---black women\'s bodies are, and have always been, used in the
United States as a **mechanism to reconstitute the state as
white**.]{.underline} In Killing the Black Body, [Dorothy Roberts offers
a meticulous history of the control of black childbearing imposed by
various forms of white power throughout the history of the United
States]{.underline} (**[slavery, Jim Crow, sterilization campaigns, the
war on drugs, and so on).]{.underline}** Roberts lists a number of cases
where the state\'s discovery of a pregnant black woman\'s drug use
becomes an excuse to demand abortion by threatening \[End Page 80\] the
mother with a jail sentence.1 She argues that, with a few exceptions,
black pregnant women were drug tested and reported to the district
attorney by hospitals, while white pregnant women were not (1997, 158).
And these cases serve as a precedent for all women: what the state does
to black women it can do to all women. For Roberts, reproductive rights
are a question of social justice, not simply of individual rights (1997,
6). Reproductive rights are double edged: people have the right to bear
children as equally as they have the right not to. Social justice
locates these rights in a woman\'s relation to herself: in her body and
her social and economic well being. Where and when the law seeks to
control motherhood, it doubly derogates those rights. In McKnight\'s
case, social justice is withheld twice, in the state\'s abrogation of
responsibility for her health as a person and a pregnant woman, and in
her prosecution as a black woman with a lost pregnancy in the face of
the state\'s failure to protect her. [At the end of the
trial]{.underline}, [a black woman sits in prison, a white prosecutor
self-righteously proclaims an important precedent to have been set, and
a committee in New York loses an attempt to rectify this miscarriage of
justice]{.underline}. [Yet for the state to consider McKnight\'s
prosecution as a precedent]{.underline}, **[it has to commit an act of
historical amnesia]{.underline}**. Far from a precedent, it [reenacts a
scene that for three hundred years has seen the sacrifice of thousands
of men and women who remain unnamed, the \"**strange fruit\" of a
\"manifest destiny**,\" to that same state sanctity]{.underline}.
McKnight\'s conviction is [entirely in keeping with the legacy of the
history of black agricultural labor]{.underline}---from plantation bond
labor to the debt servitude enforced by Jim Crow chain gangs to a
contemporary migratory labor force facing a highly racialized prison
industry. [An entire history of segregation and wanton racialized
violence is retold in this small legal act. Black people are
criminalized through their blackness for the purposes of decriminalizing
and valorizing not only the state\'s abrogation of responsibility to
them as citizens but also its imposition of dehumanizing conditions upon
them.]{.underline} In McKnight\'s case, the statements of a white state
embodied in the prosecution\'s arguments are given value and
intelligibility by that same history and the history of black
agricultural labor. What I refer to as historical amnesia does not erase
the history it forgets; it transforms that history into a cultural
logic, a means of valorizing its actions and truth claims as natural. As
amnesia, it disguises its historical antecedents in order to obviate
recognition of former injustices, such as social structures called
slavery or segregation, in order to open space to set legal precedents.
Thus, it [reduces history to a background template by which to establish
a sense of familiarity for its injustices, to make them appear
acceptable]{.underline}. But at the same time, it reveals the historical
sources of its own structure of thought, its sense of the permissible,
and the internal cultural logic of the white mind that understands these
injustices \[End Page 81\] as acceptable. In discounting McKnight\'s
arguments, her condition, her very being beyond the scope of argument,
data, or morality, the state renders her an instrument for itself. The
cultural logic of its operations takes on a proprietary value. No amount
of data or argumentation for the rights of black mothers and other women
of color will challenge this structure or prevent its reenactment.
Indeed, [it is only by erasing or dismissing data that might challenge
the state\'s claims that the state bestows validity on its indictment,
and its unobstructed call to an unspoken historical logic]{.underline}.
Here, I want to investigate the nature and meaning of the structures
that make the injustices against McKnight both recognizable and
permissible to the white state. [McKnight must be criminalized in order
to decriminalize the state\'s maintenance of brutal labor
conditions]{.underline}. [What I wish to investigate is the relation of
the hegemonic white male mind to history, in order to reveal what lies
behind its self-valorization, its ability to dispense with argument, and
to reside in the emptiest of statements while discounting]{.underline}
(through criminalization) any defense against itself. [**The state is
not white by fiat**; it is white as a cultural condition given by events
that reconstitute its history in the present]{.underline}. [To fully
understand the structure of the relation between the state\'s actions
and the devaluation and criminalization of black bodies, we must revisit
not only the historical legacy these contemporary actions repeat but
also the cultural logic that historical legacy created and
maintained.]{.underline} We are not speaking of the historical
repetition of racism here, but of something more profound. [The fact
that the state picks out black people to victimize is a pragmatic use of
racism]{.underline}. However, [for the state to decriminalize itself
through the criminalization of its victims becomes a question of social
identity]{.underline}, [and of a certain social sanctity acquired
through that identity]{.underline}. [It is the construction of **a
sanctity for whiteness**]{.underline}, [and for white racialized
consciousness that **goes beyond racism**, and empowers it]{.underline}.
In the eyes of that consciousness, a sense of justice or humanity toward
McKnight as a black woman would be an unrecognizable act. [What gives
the state\'s injustice familiarity is a structure of racialization,
whereby the state renders itself white by its acts against]{.underline}
black people, in general, and **[black women, in
particular]{.underline}**. [This structure of racialization threads its
way through U.S. history against people of color as a **cultural
norm**]{.underline}. [The modes of impunity and the form of
criminalization of the victims may change, but the underlying structure
remains the same. To grasp the inner construction of this specific
structure of racialization,]{.underline} we must return to the
seventeenth-century English colony in Virginia, [to the]{.underline}
evolution of the slave system, and, as I will argue, to the [invention
of race, whiteness, and white supremacy]{.underline}. Of particular
import will be a law passed in 1662 establishing matrilineal servitude
status. In a strange reversal of English law, where the status of the
children followed the status of the father, this new law declared that
the children\'s social status followed the servitude status of the \[End
Page 82\] mother. [This law constituted an important step in the
evolution of a structure of racialization in the colony, as it groped
its way toward a system of slavery and an identification with
whiteness]{.underline}. The victimization of McKnight reveals the
re-racializing project of the state; but to see this, **[we must
understand the history that first discloses the raw evolution of
racialization.]{.underline}**

#### The neg defines oppression through the binary of whiteness in opposition to blackness -- this essentialized view of oppression leads to the prioritization of race over all other forms of oppression and perpetuates gendered violence

**DWP 13** (Dearest White People, internet blog cultural poltics, \"The
Black Mythical Norm: Intersectionality and the Nationalist Construction
of "Blackness",\" April 16,
dearestwhitepeople.wordpress.com/2012/04/16/black-mythical-norm/)

In "Age, Race, Class, and Sex: Women Redefining Difference," Audre Lorde
defines what she calls a "mythical norm" in the United States, which is
usually "white, thin, male, young, heterosexual... and financially
secure" (Lorde, 2009, p. 517). [With regards to this default American,
Black Nationalism strives to build racial solidarity around the black
community's common deviation from the norm]{.underline}: **[Black people
are not white]{.underline}**. However, [**this essentialized view of
black people often leads to prioritization of race over all other
"deviations**" by those black individuals whose identities are most
closely aligned with the norm]{.underline}. In this nationalist
construction of blackness, the black, thin, male, young, heterosexual,
financially secure person becomes the "default" black person. According
to Mark Anthony Neal, [this nationalist construction of "blackness" led
to the creation of the "Strong Black Man" figure, which Neal posits "can
be faulted for championing a stunted, conservative, one dimensional, and
stridently heterosexual vision of black masculinity]{.underline}" (Neal,
2005, p. 24), [often to the detriment of those persons within the black
community whose experiences with racial oppression intersect with other
oppressive forces based on gender, sexuality, class, age, or any other
deviation from the nationalist-constructed notion of
"blackness."]{.underline} This paper will explore the ways in which the
nationalist-propagated image of the "Strong Black Man" interfaces with
intersectionality of racial, gender, and sexual oppression, and attempt
to grapple with the question: "who is Black enough?"¶ The notion of not
being "black enough" reverberates throughout black feminist and
masculinist writings. In "Where We Live," Essex Helphill states, "I'm as
black as anyone, but not by the criteria the nationalists construct"
(Belton, 1995, p. 214). In the same piece, in reference to the Million
Man March, Isaac Julian laments, "It's about another spectacle of
middle-class black straight men claiming ownership of blackness"
(Belton, 1995, p. 214). Audre Lorde echoes this sentiment, proclaiming,
"Black women who once insisted that lesbianism was a white woman's
problem now insist that black lesbians are a threat to black nationhood,
are consorting with the enemy, are basically unblack" (Lorde, 2009, p.
521). In "Having Their Say," Rudolph Byrd speaks to the connections
between the oppression of women and homosexuals in the black community,
stating, "I decided not to waste any more time with those folks because
I understood that I could never be Black enough for them... And so it
was my experience with homophobia and the rejection of my blackness that
caused me to empathize with women" (Cole & Guy-Sheftall, 2003, p. 51).
[Alongside attacks on queer individuals for not living up to nationalist
constructions of "blackness" come accusations of betrayal and treachery
toward black feminists and womanists who dare speak out against black
male sexism]{.underline}. As Lorde asserts, "[Black women's literature
is full of the pain of frequent assault, not only by a racist
patriarchy, but also by black men]{.underline}. Yet the necessity for
and history of shared battle have made us, black women, particularly
vulnerable to the false accusation that anti-sexist is anti-black"
(Lorde, 2009, p. 520).¶ [Despite feeling marginalized from within their
own black communities, women and men who don't fit into essentialized
notions of "blackness" often don't wish to separate themselves from
those]{.underline} black males [who propagate]{.underline} sexist,
heterosexist, and [misogynistic attitudes.]{.underline} Unlike
self-identified white marginalized individuals who advocate
fractionalization from their white heterosexual male oppressors, black
people faced with intersecting systems of oppression are still able to
feel united with black nationalists in their struggle against racial
oppression. This may be because the white "community" in the United
States is no community at all, but rather merely a built-in privilege
that has been so long characterized as "default" that it allows white
women, lesbians, gay men, and transgendered individuals to define their
identities in terms of their own experience, without ever needing to
contemplate race. [In contrast to this, women, lesbians, gay men, and
transgendered individuals in the black community must view their
condition through the lens of their experiences with multiple layers of
oppression, which means that a separationist attitude within their
racial category is not so simple]{.underline}. As stated by the Combahee
River Collective, "Our situation as black people necessitates that we
have solidarity around the fact of race... We struggle together with
black men against racism, while we also struggle with black men about
sexism" (The Combahee River Collective, 2009, p. 504). The collective
struggle against racism, although ripe with complexity, is not one that
many Black people seek to abandon, regardless of potentially harmful
nationalist sentiments.¶ [Because the intersectionality of oppressions
facing black people who deviate from the essentialized, or default,
image of "blackness" occur simultaneously, it is often difficult for
individuals who must cope with many intersecting systems of oppression
to separate their basis of oppression into categories and prioritize
them in the same way that a black heterosexual male may be able
to.]{.underline} [The ability and willingness to prioritize identities
has much to do with power relationships both among black people and
relative to white people. As black nationalists rally together to combat
forces of racism, they often strategically seek to do so in ways that
run parallel to the white patriarchal power structure]{.underline}. As
Isaac Julien argues, "It's a question of power. Black men have been
rendered powerless by the dominant society, and it's that drive to have
power at any cost, no matter what is silenced or dismissed" (Belton,
1995, p. 213). Upon deeper analysis of this quote, it becomes apparent
that although much of the black community has been "rendered powerless,"
the heterosexual black man in particular has been marginalized by the
white supremacy system alone[. Because the system of patriarchy allows
heterosexual black men to focus on only one of their identities as the
object of oppression, these individuals are elevated to a place of power
within the black community where they are able to feel anger toward
those black people whom they see as raising "other" identity issues that
complicate what Angela Davis aptly called "narrow
nationalism"]{.underline} (Davis, 1992, p. 320). According to Audre
Lourde, "[Within black communities, where racism is a living reality,
differences among us often seem dangerous and suspect]{.underline}. [The
need for unity is often misnamed as a need for homogeneity, and a black
feminist vision mistaken for betrayal of our common interests as
people]{.underline}" (Lorde, 2009, p. 519).¶ [One of the greatest
pitfalls of Black Nationalism and essentialism is that as a strategy for
white acceptance and assimilation into white American culture it is
premised on the black community's acceptance of other power constructs
such as patriarchy and heteronormativity]{.underline}. Norm R. Allen,
Jr. calls this strategy "Reactionary Black Nationalism." Allen, Jr.
posits, ["'On the one hand, Reactionary Black Nationalists advocate
self-love, self-respect, self-acceptance, self-help, pride
unity']{.underline}---all valuable and needed attributes for members of
black communities and institutions---[but also promote 'bigotry,
intolerance, hatred, sexism \[and\] homophobia' among other
things]{.underline}" (Neal, 2005, p. 23). This hypothesis is furthered
by evidence of acceptance in the nationalist community of what Louis
Farrakhan called "defects of character." [Just as Farrakhan was forgiven
for his self-described "heart... dark with hat]{.underline}red"
(Farrakhan, 1996, p. 11), as [apparently shown in his blatant sexism and
heterosexism]{.underline}, and Eldridge Cleave[r is still held in high
regard despite his misogyny and homophobia, Reactionary Black
Nationalists' chauvinist sentiments are "largely ignored or seen as
excusable in a world where 'race' often trumps 'gender' and 'sexuality'
as meaningful issues]{.underline} within the black community" (Neal,
2005, pp. 23-24**[). By prioritizing race in the context of
oppression]{.underline}**, [black heterosexual males silence voices
within the black community that they see as obstacles to their strategy
of gaining acceptance and power for "black people" as defined by their
own construct]{.underline}.

#### Their desire for [purity]{.underline} and [authenticity]{.underline} limits the possibility for the creation of complex communication communities that limits the [praxis for engagement]{.underline} and normalizes dehumanization of victims of heterosexism

**Hoagland 7** (Sarah, Professor of Philosphy and Women Studies at
Northeastern Illinois University in Chicago, Collective Member of the
Institute of LEsbian Studies and of the Escuela Popular Norteña,
\"Heterosexualism and White Supremacy,\" Hypatia 22.1, 166-185, Muse)

We Are Everywhere . . . Or Not at All [Communities, of course, can
become oppressive in critical ways, particularly when their
practitioners think of them as institutions rather than
contexts]{.underline} (looser and more ambiguous), for example, [when
those assuming \"leadership\" act in terms of **purity and
authenticity** (]{.underline}note Lugones 2003, chap. 7). What brings
lesbians together in community? [Not fear, which is the current basis of
U.S. solidarity, nor is it common oppression.]{.underline} To begin
with, there is our desire. [Desire and creativity are a central part of
our possibilities]{.underline}, ingenious lesbian creativity, making so
much---bookstores, coffee houses, poetry, publishing houses, music,
bars, sports teams, record companies, theory, music festivals, jewelry,
methods of healing. And what are possibilities of lesbian communities?
In addition to loving women, [because we are everywhere, there is
enacting a praxis of engaging through difference rather than
similarity]{.underline}, at first brought as a structural challenge by
Audre Lorde. And that, it seems to me, [grounds our possibilities, our
work---not working for state-constructed \"rights\" but developing
complex communication]{.underline} (Lugones 2006[). I despair at the
multilevels of heterosexualism and white supremacy by which our actions
and imaginations are framed]{.underline}. [It undermines possibilities
of lesbian community and all the work in community building we have to
do.]{.underline} In taking up el pasar discontinuo de la
cachapera/tortillera del barrio a la barra al moviemiento (the
discontinuous passing of the cachapera/tortillera from the barrio to the
bar to the movement),9 María Lugones notes \"la tortillera exists en la
comunidad only as a pervert. Perversion constitutes her and marks her as
outside of countenanced relationality. . . . En la comunidad, under the
reigns of nationalism, la cachapera is silent, her meaning is made by
others\" (Lugones 2003, 174). Within African-American communities, out
lesbians can be seen not as black, but as a white perversion (Carruthers
1979). \[End Page 180\] [Yet \"instead of cultivating her company toward
impure shatterings of colonized communion]{.underline}s, la cachapera
becomes the Latina/Lesbian,\" moving into the territoriality of the
Lesbian Movement---white locales, movement that does not move into
Latino communities. So \"Latina/Lesbian is an oxymoron, an absence of
relation. Latina/Lesbian lacks a hyphen\" and so hybridization. \"The
movement of the tortillera into the Lesbian Movement is a fantastic
flight because she comes out to a forced speaking in a bifid tongue;
because the eyes that see her coming out, remake her in their own
imagination\" (Lugones 2003, 174--76). And so the Latina/Lesbian who was
working to make a place for herself in the campus Feminist Majority, not
to mention the campus GLBTA, finds herself alone once again. At the
\"Heterosexism and Empire\" workshop, one Vietnamese lesbian questioned,
given the history of gendering in her country, what it would mean for
her to talk about being masculine or feminine. A Korean transperson
talked about the effects of Christian missionaries in her immigrant
community. And a Palestinian woman noted there was an assumption that if
people are queer, they are not going to be Muslim. **[Communities are
the places of our possibilities]{.underline}**, [the places from which
we grow]{.underline}. Moreover, my capacity to be a lesbian [involves a
relationality proscribed by dominant fragmentation, by
heterosexualism]{.underline}. **[It animates through praxis of
engagement]{.underline}**.[10 If tortilleras, bulldaggers, marimachas,
swing girls, desi dykes, among many others, can only act out in lesbian
community and are forced into the closet among family and local
community; if la tortillera is cut off from a critical community, from a
central source that nourishes her, if she can only be lesbian outside a
critical place of her possibilities, and once outside only as someone
acting out]{.underline}, **[if her possibilities]{.underline}** of
utcatha are **[negated]{.underline}**, then as María Lugones suggests,
**[she is a phantasm.]{.underline}** And if she is a phantasm, then so
am I. What, finally, concerns me is community, lesbian communities.
**[That\'s what heterosexualism and white supremacy
destroy]{.underline}**. Lesbian [activism has shifted from community
building where we developed resources and came together to create, to
make something happen, shifted from coming together in collective work
to develop communities that undermine oppression, shifted from all that
to asking and depending on the state to frame what is significant in our
lives]{.underline}. I don\'t doubt the sincerity of those who are
fighting hard for rights; I despair the appropriation of lesbian
imagination, the loss of Sinister Wisdom. \[End Page 181\]

**[Caribbean overflows with hyperfeeling female
sexuality.]{.underline}** **[Recentering the resistantly nonphallic
Peoples of the Sea]{.underline}**, Benítez-Rojo
**[foreground]{.underline}**s **[a vaginalized Caribbean as he
proclaims: The Atlantic is today the Atlantic (]{.underline}**the navel
of capitalism**[) because Europe,]{.underline}** in its mercantilist
laboratory**[, conceived of the project of inseminating the Caribbean
womb with the blood of Africa; the Atlantic]{.underline}** is today the
Atlantic . . . because it **[is the painfully delivered child of the
Caribbean, whose vagina was stretched between continental
clamps]{.underline}**. . . . After the blood and salt water spurts,
quickly sew up torn flesh and apply the antiseptic tinctures, the gauze
and surgical plaster; then the febrile wait through the forming of a
scar: suppurating, always suppurating.13 **[Here sexual violence and
painful reproduction are simultaneously abstracted and reinscribed in
regional imaginations; projected onto the water]{.underline}** by which
Caribbean women arrived in the archipelago, **[they conceive a
disturbing image that spreads women's metaphoric legs in unsettling
ways. Yet the suppurating wound can heal, almost magically. A few pages
later, the vaginal sea opens into a metaphor for liberatory pleasure and
pleasurable liberation]{.underline}** as Benítez-Rojo imagines the
region's femininity **[as "its flux, its diffuse sensuality, its
generative force, its capacity to nourish and conserve]{.underline}**
(juices, spring, pollen, rain, seed, shoot, ritual sacrifice)."14
**[Bleeding, orgasming, or both]{.underline}**, Benítez-Rojo's cunnic
Caribbean overexposes the¶ sexualized bodies that Gilroy denies. **[Like
the sea, the space between women's legs is at once insistently present
and insistently ethereal; like the sea, the space between women's legs
becomes a metaphor to mine. These tropes of the black Atlantic, of
Peoples of the Sea, do call to me as powerful enunciations of
crosscurrents of African diaspora identity, and I evoke them in respect
and solidarity]{.underline}**. And yet as Gilroy, Benítez-Rojo, Edouard
Glissant,¶ and **[others call on maritime metaphors without maritime
histories and evoke]{.underline}**¶ **[sexualized bodies as figures
rather than experiences, their writing out of
materiality]{.underline}**¶ **[stops short of the most radical potential
of such oceanic imaginations]{.underline}**.15 There¶ are other Atlantic
and Caribbean histories that these scholars could have evoked¶ to make
sense of the present, other material details of maritime crossings they¶
could have drawn on to make their metaphors richer conceptual tools**[.
As Africans]{.underline}**¶ **[became diasporic, Atlantic]{.underline}**
and Caribbean**[, sex and sexuality did not only impact]{.underline}**¶
**[imaginations; they impacted bodies. Not at all an opening to infinite
possibilities,]{.underline}**¶ **[the sea was initially a site of
painful fluidities for many Africans]{.underline}**. The first sight¶ of
the ocean was often a vision of fear, as Equiano remembers when slave
traders¶ marched him to the coast:¶ I was beyond measure astonished at
this, as I had never before seen any¶ water larger than a pond or a
rivulet, and my surprise was mingled with no¶ small fear. . . . The
first object which saluted my eyes when I arrived on the¶ coast was the
sea, and a slave ship, which was then riding at anchor, and¶ waiting for
its cargo. These filled me with astonishment, which was soon¶ converted
to terror.16¶ **[Once loaded onto the slave ships, Africans became fluid
bodies under the force]{.underline}**¶ **[of brutality.]{.underline}**
Tightly or loosely packed in sex-segregated holds --- men chained¶
together at the ankles while women were sometimes left unchained ---
surrounded¶ by churning, unseen waters, these brutalized bodies
themselves became liquid,¶ oozing. Ship's surgeon Alexander Falconbridge
records days when "wet and blowing weather having occasioned the
portholes to be shut and the grating to be covered,¶ fluxes and fevers
among the negroes ensued. . . . The deck was so covered¶ with the blood
and mucus which had proceeded from them in consequence of¶ the flux,
that it resembled a slaughterhouse."17 Lara adds to this imagination in¶
a character's vision of a slave ship: "Women's menstrual blood stained
the floor¶ around her, pus crusting at the edges of the chattel wounds.
. . . She could feel¶ her body rise in a wave of urine and blood, the
stench so wretched as to make her¶ choke on her own breath."18 **[On
this Atlantic, then, black body waters, corporeal]{.underline}**¶
**[effluvia, and the stains of gendered and reproductive bodies were
among the first]{.underline}**¶ **[sites of
colonization.]{.underline}**¶ But this bloody Atlantic was also the site
of collaboration and resistance.¶ In the early eighteenth century, ship
captains like John Newton and James Barbot¶ repeatedly record with
horror how despite such conditions slaves conspired to¶ rebel against
captors. At the same time, unnamed rebellions took place not in¶ violent
but in erotic resistance, in interpersonal relationships enslaved
Africans¶ formed with those imprisoned and oozing beside them.

#### The structure of racial politics is inherently unstable and contradictory especially at key historical moments like the War on Terror---the aff's targeting of specific leverage points in the political imaginary is the best strategy for overcoming the sedimentation anti-blackness

**[Structural racism -- an odious stinkpile of shit left over from the
past and still being augmented in the present -- has been accumulated by
'slavery unwilling to die]{.underline}**',4 by empire, and indeed by the
entire racialized modern world system**[. The immense
waste]{.underline}** (Feagin et al., 2001, drawing on Bataille) **[of
human life and labor by these historically entrenched social structures
and practices still confronts us toda]{.underline}**y, in the aftermath
of the post-Second World War racial 'break'. **[Our antiracist
accomplishments have reduced the size of the pile; we have lessened the
stink]{.underline}**. **[But a massive amount of waste still
remains]{.underline}**. So much racial waste is left over from the
practice of racial domination in the early days of empire and conquest,
to the present combination of police state and liberalism! Indeed **[it
often seems that this enormous and odious waste pinions the social
system under an immovable burden. How often have despair and
hopelessness overcome those who bore this sorrow? How often have slave
and native]{.underline}**, peon and maquiladora, servant and
ghetto-dweller, **[felt just plain 'sick and tired']{.underline}**
(Nappy Roots, 2003), encumbered by this deadening inertia composed of a
racial injustice that could seemingly never be budged? How often, too,
have whites felt weighed down by the waste, the guilt and
self-destruction built into racism and the 'psychological wage'? Yet
**[racial politics is always unstable and contradictory. Racial
despotism can never be fully stabilized or consolidated.]{.underline}**
**[Thus at key historical moments, perhaps rare but also inevitable, the
sheer weight of racial oppression]{.underline}** -- qua social structure
-- **[becomes insupportable.]{.underline}** **[The built-up rage and
inequity]{.underline}**, the irrationality and inutility, **[and the
explosive force of dreams denied, are mobilized politically in ways that
would have seemed almost unimaginable earlier. Racism remains
formidable, entrenched as a structuring feature of both US and global
society and politics]{.underline}**. **[Indeed it often seems impossible
to overcome.We are so used to losing! We can't see that the racial
system is in crisis both in the US and globally. Large-scale demographic
and political shifts have overtaken the modern world (racial) system,
undermining and rearticulating it.]{.underline}** During **[and after
the Second World War a tremendous racial 'break' occurred, a seismic
shift that swept much of the world]{.underline}** (Winant, 2001). **[The
US was but one]{.underline}** national '**[case' of this
rupture]{.underline}**, which was experienced very profoundly: **[racial
transformations occurred that were unparalleled since at least the
changes brought about by the US Civil War.]{.underline}** Omi and I
(1994) -- and many, many others -- have proposed that **[the terrain of
racial politics was tremendously broadened and deepened after the
War]{.underline}**. The increased importance of race in larger political
life not only grounded the modern civil rights movement but shaped a
whole range of 'new social movements' that we take for granted today as
central axes of political conflict. In earlier stages of US history it
had not been so evident that 'the personal is political' -- at least not
since the end of Reconstruction. From the explicit racial despotism of
the Jim Crow era to the 'racial democracy' (of course still very partial
and truncated) of the present period ... : that is a big leap, people.
In the modern world there were always black movements, always movements
for racial justice and racial freedom**[. The experience of injustice,
concrete grievances, lived oppression, and resistance, both large and
small, always exists.]{.underline}** It can be articulated or not,
politicized or not**[. These movements, these demands, were largely
excluded from mainstream politics before the rise of the civil rights
movement after the War]{.underline}**. Indeed, after the Second World
War, in a huge 'break' that was racially framed in crucial ways, **[this
'politicization of the social' swept over the world. It ignited (or
reignited) major democratic upsurges]{.underline}**. This included the
explicitly anti-racist movements: the modern civil rights movement, the
anti-apartheid movement, and the anti-colonial movement (India, Algeria,
Vietnam, etc.). It also included parallel, and more-or-less allied,
movements like 'secondwave' feminism, LGBTQ (née gay liberation)
movements, and others. In short, the world-historical upheaval of the
Second World War and its aftermath were racial upheavals in significant
ways: the periphery against the center, the colored 'others' against
'The Lords of Human Kind' (Kiernan, 1995). These movements produced: ••
Demographic, economic, political, and cultural shifts across the planet
•• The destruction of the old European empires •• The coming and going
of the Cold War •• The rise of the 'new social movements', led by the
black movement in the US And this is only the start of what could be a
much bigger list. A Crisis of Race and Racism? '\[C\]risis', Gramsci
famously wrote, 'consists precisely in the fact that the old is dying
and the new cannot be born: in this interregnum, morbid phenomena of the
most varied kind come to pass' (Gramsci, 1971: 276). Using the Gramscian
formula, I suggest that there is such a crisis of race and racism. On
the one hand, the old verities of established racism and white supremacy
have been officially discredited, not only in the US but fairly
comprehensively around the world. On the other hand, racially-informed
action and social organization, racial identity and race consciousness,
continue unchecked in nearly every aspect of social life! On the one
hand, the state (many states around the world) now claims to be
colorblind, non-racialist, racially democratic; while on the other hand,
in almost every case, those same states need race to rule. **[Consider
in the US alone: race and electoral politics, race and social control,
race and legal order ... Why don't our heads explode under the pressures
of such cognitive dissonance? Why doesn't manifest racial contradiction
provoke as much uncertainty and confusion in public life and political
activity as it does in everyday experience?]{.underline}** Are we just
supposed to pretend that none of this is happening? Can anyone really
sustain the view that they are operating in a nonracial, 'colorblind'
society? The 'colorblind' claim is that one should not 'notice' race.
For if one 'sees' race, one wouldn't be 'blind' to it, after all.5 But
what happens to race-consciousness under the pressure (now rather
intense in the US, anyway) to be 'colorblind'? Quite clearly, **[racial
awareness does not dry up like a raisin in the sun]{.underline}**.

#### . we must affirm the plurality of different anti-colonial epistemic frameworks in tandem to break the supposed universalism of imperial thinking 

**Stamenkovic 13** (Marko, PhD Student at Universityof Ghent and member

Similarly, **[what Mbembe proposes is to work out our own ways towards
another vision of the world, perceived from another viewpoint. Such a
vision is]{.underline}** but **[a significant example of today's
counter-hegemonic theoretical strategies]{.underline}**, **[produced
locally]{.underline}** yet **[with the]{.underline}** causality and
**[implications of global necrocolonial politics in mind]{.underline}**.
However, **[this vision is not conceived and shall not be accepted as
another particular local knowledge, constructed in defense of a yet
another pseudo-universal form of thinking that aspires to become the new
epistemic sovereignty.]{.underline}** **[We have to understand it as an
alternative to the existent pseudo-universalism of imperial thinking
and]{.underline}**, by doing so, **[to work towards establishing a
possible counter-hegemonic theoretical coexistence among various
knowledge-worlds in their plurality]{.underline}**. Mbembe's own
arguments have inscribed his theory of necropolitics into contemporary
philosophy as one possible and legitimate variant of global knowledges.
That is the main reason why to understand necropolitics means to
approach it as the other of biopolitics: not as its clone but as its
inevitable half in the 'Siamese twin' situation. In this regard**[, I
treat the theory of necropolitics as an intentionally pseudo-universal
option characterized by the strategic propensity to claim its own
'universality' on behalf of the global anti-imperialist
South]{.underline}**, and justly so: because **[its pseudo-universalism
is aware of universalist mythology and its counter-effects: an obscurity
imposed by the regime of singular universe of knowledge in the
modern/colonial/capitalist/racial world-system]{.underline}**
(Grosfoguel and Cervantes-Rodríguez, 2002). **[Necropolitical theory
thus appears as a disguised decolonial option behind which the South
enters into a profound dialogue with the obdurate Northern epistemic
mytheme.]{.underline}** Positioned side by side**[, they must keep this
dialogue open.]{.underline}** **[If the biopolitical armature (the
dominant structure of knowledge-communication]{.underline}**) **[is
gradually dismantled through such a dialogue, this will allow for a
truly emancipatory potential of theoretical propositions]{.underline}**,
earlier dismissed**[, to be exposed again]{.underline}** (or, in many
cases, for the first time ever). In that sense, Mbembe's 'return of
death' to philosophy is part of the global and unavoidable process that
is not only characterized by one single anti-imperial paradigm
('necropolitical', for that matter) but rather by numerous possible
paradigms unrelated to necropolitics itself. Within such complexity,
**[a single imperial epistemology is an insufficient option to cope with
the numerous modalities of knowledge, or the pluriverse of local
knowledge(s)]{.underline}**. Hence**[, to have the epistemological
pluralism legitimized -- and to have such legitimacy recognized and
globally accepted side by side with the imperialist epistemology -- is
not only a worthwhile but an urgent task. It is so for the global
anti-imperialist South as much as for the rest of the
world.]{.underline}**

## AT: Baudrillard

#### There is no all-encompassing system of value that makes everything people do the capitalisms---your impact claims are overdetermined and vague---the affirmative's creation of new codes is an effective form of politics.

**MacCannell and MacCannell 1993** (Dean and Juliet, Sociology and
English professors respectively at UC-Irvine, *Forget Baudrillard?* p.
141-143)

We are suggesting that **[Baudrillard took his analysis of the simula-
crum up to the site of the new forms of capitalist
exploitation]{.underline}** that have introjected class structure into
postmodernity. **[But he did not name the new sites of exploitation or
initiate critical examination of them. His failure in this regard places
his work at great risk]{.underline}**. Historically it may contribute as
much to the new forms of exploita- tion and their cover-up as to their
exposure and eventual overthrow. He cannot \'read\' or \'see\' Mickey
Mouse because Mickey stands in precisely the same relation to code
creation as Baudrillard\'s theory taken in its entirety. Ultimately,
both **[Baudrillard]{.underline}** and Mickey Mouse **[insist on a
generalized sense of the possible existence not of codes, which would be
subversive, but of The Code, a single frame- work, already in existence,
for everything]{.underline}**. The Code, and correla- tively the
pretence of the absence of need for any new code, **[is the only field
for the putative free play of simulacra, or the appearance of a
figure]{.underline}** of lack **[which can be universally
worshipped]{.underline}**. **[If there were a code, it truly would
accommodate human life to the impos- sible, to death, to ultimate
pleasure, to the real. I f there were a code it would be equally and
freely available to all human beings]{.underline}**. Group, class,
status, category, would disappear or be rendered insignificant**[. No
wonder it is fervently desired by the prematurely utopian adherents of
every political position]{.underline}**. It would be stable and open to
all for all time until the radical end of time that is supposed to be
the Last Judgement.¶ Postmodernity affirms the possibility of The Code
in the form of¶ pure repetition, the simulacrum, and the \'random
cannibalization of styles of the past\', as Jameson put it. But
postmodern capitalism is also committed to apparent diversity of
consumer goods within the framework of a single Code, a commitment that
produces a certain tension if not a contradiction and dialectic.
Apparent diversity is achieved by the marketing of diverse codes the
source and origin of which are officially unrecognized and repressed.¶
We suggest that what is being exploited by postmodern capital- ism are
the codes of those in the starkest of human situations, who have
confronted \'the worst\' most radically in their \'lifestyles\' (=codes)
or modes of relating to death and fulfilment. **[What is most
successfully \'marketed\' today are simulacra of whole ways of existing,
adaptations of \'gang youth\', punks, \'primitive\' Brazilian
Indians]{.underline}** (At Play in the Fields of the Lord), homeless
people, bag ladies, hookers, war victims, AIDS sufferers (the list is
extended daily), their codes, the means they have worked out for dealing
with the worst. We further suggest that Lacan was correct in his
assertion that the \'panic\' of the drive has displaced the Symbolic of¶
desire for the contemporary or postmodern subject. There is no more
\'needs fulfilment\' in postmodernity. Capitalism, driven beyond its
capacity to provide, has seen to that. **[All that it can promise us now
is an endless series of futile attempts to accommo- date that which
carmot be accommodated: the satisfied need, ultimate jouissance,
death]{.underline}**. Its radical failure of symbolization leaves its
believers \'eyeball to eyeball\' with The Real. Postmodern capitalism is
the realm of \'enjoyment\', where the human subject is commanded \'to
enjoy\' but carmot, where pleasure that cannot be experienced spills
over into The Thing, where our \'things\' obscenely and menacingly enjoy
themselves at our expense.¶ But there are those among us who deal
directly with the absolute- ness of loss, those who know there is no
substitutability, no itera- bility, no supplement. They have carved out
an existence on the empty gound between the possibility of the
symbolization of desire and the dream of a single Symbolic-Paternal
Order. They are the only possible source of a critical viewpoint on
postmodern capital- ism and of the creative energy needed to move it.
**[We are disappointed with Baudrillard for not having found the site of
post- modern exploitation, for giving us instead nostalgia for the
medieval Church in the form of the now commonplace postmodern assertion
of its absence]{.underline}**. But if **[Baudrillard]{.underline}**
spends all his time with¶ commodities-as-simulacra, with God as
simulacrum, with things that can have no relation to need, there must be
a reason for it. He **[is avoiding the ground that has been departed by
the cause of desire, the ground where new codes are created as a matter
of necessity]{.underline}**. This is the reason he did not find Mickey
Mouse. Mickey is there on the ground of departed desire as a defender of
its borders, to block those who have not entered and to cover up the
creative adaptations of those who have. Mickey permits us to imagine
that there is a universal code of which he is the emanation and
emissary, while his owners, if not his animators, know there are as many
codes - ripe for the plucking - as there are human groupings. What
Mickey does not permit us to imagine is his code: that his head, with
the two ears that never change their location or position, that his head
is not only the maternal breast and the castrated balls, but a motion
picture projector. What this Mickey- projector reproduces is not a
universal code for iteration as has been claimed. It is rather a
faithful reproduction of the absolute loss human life is based upon; of
the theft of its creativity, its reduction, and abject resignation in
the face of The Real.

and other non-psychoanalytic thinkers focus on neoliberal subjective
practices that demand a shift from comfort with dependence to
repudiation of dependence. In a psychoanalytic frame, however, which
recognizes no possibility of overcoming dependence**[, the task is to
comprehend the psychic effects of a cultural lack of attunement to
dependency needs and a cultural encouragement to split off and project
dependency needs and vulnerability]{.underline}**. Such
**[effects]{.underline}**, as we have seen, **[include intense shame
about dependence]{.underline}** (see [Jimenez and Walkerdine,
2012](http://www.palgrave-journals.com/pcs/journal/v19/n2/full/pcs20145a.html#bib43)),
**[omnipotent versions of autonomy, and narcissistic processes that
include oscillations between grandiosity and self-deprecation with
regard to the self, and idealization and devaluation with regard to the
relation with others]{.underline}**. **[These narcissistic states and
oscillations are motored by the fantasies subtending the fetish
structure of a perverse society that disavows a reality marked by gross
failures of accountability and proper caretaking by those in
authority]{.underline}** ([Layton,
2010](http://www.palgrave-journals.com/pcs/journal/v19/n2/full/pcs20145a.html#bib58)).
T**[he fantasies endemic to narcissistic neoliberal subject formation
are produced in part by the radical split between autonomy and
connection described earlier]{.underline}** (and enacted differently by
different groups): in the autonomy fantasy, we imagine ourselves
self-sufficient and omnipotent, needing no one (the entrepreneurial
self**[); in the fantasy marked by neoliberalism's degraded state of
dependency, we fantasize that we will be loved and taken care of without
having to make any effort]{.underline}**. [Chang and Glynos

have well elaborated the ways that **[overinvestment in these fantasy
logics operates in contemporary UK political culture, issuing in
oscillations between policies that reproduce dependency and policies
that punish dependency.]{.underline}**

#### Baudrillard's theory cannot distinguish between the productive politics of the aff and the mass snooze of commodification---the affirmative disproves the simulation thesis by producing content that ruptures and interrupts the droning message of the war on terror.

**Rojek 1993** (Chris, Senior Editor in Sociology at Routledge *Forget
Baudrillard?* P. 120

Yet **[to imply that poetry excludes politics is surely
eccentric]{.underline}** **[Observing and communicating cannot be
satisfactorily understood as unchanging constants. There is an
historical dimension to them]{.underline}**, as unchanging constants.
There is an historical dimension to them. **[Baudrillard's sociology is
fatally immune to this because it is bluntly ahistorical. So it ignores
how observing and communicating have changed and minimizes the
stratified difference sbetween communicators and observers. Baudrillard
correctly stresses that the distraction factories of the gflobal
communications industry confuyse our sense of change and our awareness
of difference. But the minimalist picture of humans as 'monitroing
screens' or 'terminals in mass communication networks' which his
sociloygy supplies is an unsuitable answer to this confusion. It does
not even take seriously the circulation processes which his work
identifies. For circulation involves not only repetition but also
reaction]{.underline}**. Benjamin's sociology allows for reaction. His
discussion of mass reproduction and the global circulation of images,
bodies and commodities **[does not negate a political response; on the
contrary it demands one. The decline of aura, the homogenization of
culture and the manipulation of the masses are all things which Benjamin
opposes. There may be a note of melancholy in his assessment of the
prospects for successfully opposing these historical tendencies but he
does not waver in his commitment to struggle and resistance. In
contrast, Bduarillard discusses mass reproduction , homogenization, and
manipulation as immoveable facts of life. One relates ot them through
irony, play, seduyction and movement. Commitment in Baudrillard's
aleatory, reversible universe is always a sign of stuborrness. It closes
down one's range of response to the isness of
hyperreality]{.underline}**.

#### **Revealing counter-hegemonic knowledge for a ballot participates in ongoing displays of academic masculine posturing for who can deconstruct the most**

**Haraway 88** (Donna, "Situated Knowledges: The Science Question in
Feminism and the Privilege of Partial Perspective," *Feminist Studies*

The only people who end up actually believing and, goddess forbid,
acting on the ideological doctrines of disembodied scientific
objectivity-enshrined in elementary textbooks and technoscience Booster
literature- are nonscientists, including a few very trusting
philosophers. Of course, my designation of this last group is probably
just a reflection of a residual disciplinary chauvinism acquired from
identifying with historians of science and from spending too much time
with a microscope in early adulthood in a kind of disciplinary
preoedipal and modernist poetic moment when cells seemed to be cells and
organisms, organisms. Pace,Gertrude Stein. [But then came the law of the
father and its resolution of the problem of objectivity, a problem
solved by always already absent referents, deferred signifieds, split
subjects, and the endless play of signifiers.]{.underline} Who wouldn\'t
grow up warped? Gender, race, the world itself-all seem the effects of
warp speeds in the play of signifiers in a cosmic force field. In any
case, [social constructionists might maintain that the ideological
doctrine of scientific method and all the philosophical verbiage about
epistemology were cooked up]{.underline} to distract our attention from
getting to know the world effectively by practicing the sciences. [From
this point of view, science-the real game in town- is rhetoric, a series
of efforts to persuade relevant social actors that one\'s manufactured
knowledge is a route to a desired form of very objective
power]{.underline}. Such persuasions must take account of the structure
of facts and artifacts, as well as of language-mediated actors in the
knowledge game. Here, artifacts and facts are parts of the powerful art
of rhetoric. Practice is persuasion, and the focus is very much on
practice. All knowledge is a condensed node in an agonistic power field.
The strong program in the sociology of knowledge joins with the lovely
and nasty tools of semiology and deconstruction to insist on the
rhetorical nature of truth, including scientific truth. [History is a
story Western culture buffs tell each other; science is a contestable
text and a power field; the content is the form]{.underline}. Period. So
much for those of us who would still like to talk about reality with
more confidence than we allow to the Christian Right when they discuss
the Second Coming and their being raptured out of the final destruction
of the world. We would like to think our appeals to real worlds are more
than a desperate lurch away from cynicism and an act of faith like any
other cult\'s, no matter how much space we generously give to all the
rich and always historically specific mediations through which we and
everybody else must know the world. [But the further I get in describing
the radical social constructionist program and a particular version of
postmodernism]{.underline}, coupled with the acid tools of critical
discourse in the human sciences, [the more nervous I get. The imagery of
force fields, of moves in a fully textualized and coded world, which is
the working metaphor in many arguments about socially negotiated reality
for the postmodern subject, is, just for starters, an imagery of
high-tech military fields, of automated academic battle-fields, where
blips of light called players disintegrate]{.underline} (what a
metaphor!) [each other in order to stay in the knowledge and power game.
Technoscience and science fiction collapse into the sun of the irradiant
(ir)reality-war]{.underline}. It shouldn\'t take decades of feminist
theory to sense the enemy here. Nancy Hartsock got all this crystal
clear in her concept of abstract masculinity. [I, and others, started
out wanting a strong tool for deconstructing the truth claims of hostile
science by showing the radical historical specificity, and so
contestability of every layer of the onion of scientific and
technological constructions, and we end up with a kind of
epistemological electroshock therapy, which far from ushering us into
the high stakes tables of the game of contesting public truths, lays us
out on the table with self-induced multiple personality
disorder.]{.underline} We wanted a way to go beyond showing bias in
science (that proved too easy any how) and beyond separating the good
scientific sheep from the bad goats of bias and misuse. It seemed
promising to do this by the strongest possible constructionist argument
that left no cracks for reducing the issues to bias versus objectivity,
use versus misuse, science versus pseudo- science. [We unmasked the
doctrines of objectivity because they threatened our budding sense of
collective historical subjectivity and agency and our \"embodied\"
accounts of the truth, and we ended up with]{.underline} one more excuse
for not learning any post-Newtonian physics and [one more reason to
drop]{.underline} the old [feminist self-help practices]{.underline} of
repairing our own cars. They\'re just texts anyway, so let the boys have
them back.

## AT: Framework 

#### The counter-interp is to center feminist action research in debate- FAR 

Reid 04, (Colleen Reid, Simon Fraser University, "Advancing Women's
Social Justice Agendas: A Feminist Action Research Framework", published
in IIQM) GP

Participatory research and contemporary feminism share a number of major
underlying features centering on the analysis of political economy and
praxis (Maguire, 1993[). The notion of praxis challenges the
theory-practice relationship and raises problems associated with
value-free science]{.underline}. The term "praxis" originates from the
Greek word prasso meaning "doing" and "acting," in contrast with the
theoretical designs of epistemology; theoria 3 (Audi, 1995). Lal (1996)
refers to pedagogical praxis the erasing of the boundaries between
theory, methodology, and practice, and between field and home (Lal,
1996). Other researchers define praxis as a dialectical process of
collective reflection and action (Israel et al., 1994; Kirby & McKenna,
1989), the joining of theory and action so that each is informed by and
changes through its relation with the other (Ristock & Pennell, 1996),
and the integration of knowing and doing (Kirby & McKenna, 1989). For
praxis to be possible, theory must not only illuminate the lived
experience of social groups, it must also be illuminated by their
struggles (Lather, 1991). [Theory is thought of as experience-based
(Park, 2001), and reflection itself is embedded in praxis, not separate
from it]{.underline}. Action upon reality and analyses of that learning
may change awareness of the nature of problems and the sources of
oppression (Gaventa & Cornwall, 2001). [The processes of uncovering
marginalized knowledges, giving priority to these knowledges, and
enabling the collaborative development of action strategies are
simultaneously theoretical and methodological. Woven within and between
each of the following characteristics of a FAR framework is the notion
of praxis theory]{.underline}, methods, and practice in dynamic
interplay. A Feminist Action Research framework FAR guidingPrinciples
[Through integrating participatory research with feminist theory and
research, the following guiding principles for FAR emerged: inclusion,
participation, action, social change, and researcher
reflexivity]{.underline}. Inclusion The first principle of feminist
action research is inclusion. To include is to cause to be a part of
something, to consider with, or to put into a group (Morris, 1982).
Feminist action researchers contend that no social practices or
activities should be excluded as improper subjects for public
discussion, expression, or collective choice; no one should be forced
into privacy (Young, 1990). [Gender and women‟s daily experiences are
central in the construction of theoretical frameworks]{.underline} and
feminist action research methods. [Women‟s experiences are central in
several ways in understanding patriarchy as a system of domination and
oppression]{.underline}, in identifying key issues and questions in all
phases of the research process including action and evaluation, and in
giving explicit attention to how women and men as groups benefit from
the project.4 [Feminist action researchers expose the inadequacy of
androcentric research and its partial, inaccurate, and incomplete
representation of human experience when women are muted]{.underline}
(Maguire, 2001). By beginning with the experiences and research needs of
women who have traditionally been silenced, the process of knowledge
production is transformed and the ideological power base is challenged
(Kirby & McKenna, 1989). Feminist action researchers seek to connect the
articulated, contextualized personal with the often hidden or invisible
structural and social institutions that define and shape our lives.
Feminist action researchers attempt to make possible the development of
strategies and programs based on real life experience rather than
theories or assumptions, providing an analysis of issues based on a
description of how women actually experience those issues (Barnsley &
Ellis, 1992). Participation Inclusion is a precursor to the second
principle of feminist action research participation[. To participate is
"to take part, join, or share with others"]{.underline} (Morris, 1982).
Feminist action researchers are committed to making women‟s voices more
audible and facilitating women‟s empowerment through "ordinary talk"
(Maguire, 2001).

#### Prefer the C/I-Debates about operational aspects of military policy [trade off with]{.underline} analyses of cultural constructs that justify the use of force- FAR allows us to still approach emerging technology but through a constructive frame 

**Levy 15** Levy, Yagil. Prof. Yagil Levy. Department of Sociology,
Political Science and Communication at Open University of Israel \"What
is Controlled by Civilian Control of the Military? Control of the
Military vs. Control of Militarization.\" Armed Forces & Society (2015):

Along these lines, Feaver and Gelpi showed that militarily inexperienced
leaders in the United States, more than militarily experienced ones,
extended the use of force to deal with interstate conflicts that did not
present a substantial threat to national security. 21 Desch acknowledged
that, ''the most prevalent civil-military relations problem of the
post-Vietnam era has not been keeping the dogs of war on the leash, but
rather getting them off of it''.22 In other words, civilians may be more
warprone than the military.23 It follows that [civilian control may even
promote the use of force when war-prone civilians successfully mobilize
the society for war and even push the reluctant military to
battle]{.underline}.24 Therefore, **[effective civilian control can rein
in the military but not the use of force]{.underline}**. Here,
therefore, is the gap in the literature. Students of militarism do not
link the propensity to use force to the broader issue of what type of
civilian control may restrain the use of force, aside from the cultural
process of demilitarization. Furthermore, students of militarism have
not extended the theme of civilian control from controlling the military
to controlling the civilian institutions that legitimize the use of
force. Similarly, even students of civilian control who acknowledge that
civilian control and military restraint do not necessarily go hand in
hand have not questioned the extent to which we should decouple the two
different processes as different modes of control rather than different
effects of control. In other words, they have not scrutinized the
mechanisms legitimizing the use of force decoupled from the mechanisms
monitoring the armed forces. Given this gap in the literature, in the
following section I present a revised conceptualization of civilian
control by introducing the distinction between control of the military
and control of militarization. Two Modes of Control Control of the
Military A distinction should be made between control of the military
and control of militarization. **[Control of the military refers to the
extent to which the citizenry, through civilian state institutions, sets
limits on the freedom of action of the military in the areas of activity
that have political implications, such as military doctrine and
policies, operational plans, weapons systems, organization, recruitment,
and promotion of officers. Such limits correspond with political
objectives and the resources required to attain those goals that
civilians (in a democracy, popularly elected civilians) shape
autonomously. These goals are regarded as expressing the will of society
as a whole. The military, in turn, abides by these civilian
directives]{.underline}**.25 To a large extent, relations of exchange
are formed, in which the military subordinates itself to civilian rulers
in exchange for the resources (material and symbolic) that the state
possesses and provides to the military.26 It follows that control of the
military should be broadly conceptualized and should not be limited to
the relations between elected civilians and generals. Viewed in this
vein, although authoritarian regimes effectively control their
militaries (Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy are good examples), control
of the military is deficient without the engagement of the citizenry.
**[Control over the military operates mainly through institutional
mechanisms that have an effect on the manner in which policy makers
activate the military]{.underline}**. In addition to the monitoring of
the military by elected civilians, collective actors working outside the
formal institutions, mainly social movements and interest groups, often
affect institutional policy making through lobbying, protests, court
appeals, and the media. Ultimately, [what is important is not whether
the troops are deployed to fight or remain in their barracks but the
political process that leads to the decision about the deployment,
pertaining to the broader political implication of military activity as
presented earlier]{.underline}. As a highly developed theme, control of
the military is not the focus of this article but control of
militarization and its relationship with the control of the military is.
Control of Militarization While the control of the military is aimed at
controlling the organization and its supervisors, **[the control of
militarization is concerned with controlling the mechanisms for
legitimizing the use of force.]{.underline}** Drawing on Burk's ''way of
war,''27 Johnston's ''strategic culture,''28 Mann's ''militarism,''29
and Beetham's ''political legitimacy,''30 **[the legitimacy to use force
relates to the extent to which the state's legal mode of using armed
force against an external adversary is socially accepted as a normal,
pervasive, and enduring strategic preference. Such legitimacy
encompasses social beliefs about the role of war in human affairs, the
nature of the adversary and the threat it poses, and the efficacy of the
use of force]{.underline}**. Legitimacy can be evaluated along a
spectrum whose most extreme pole at one end is pacifism. Pacifism
opposes the use of force to resolve international disputes. In the
middle of the spectrum, the use of force is legitimized when it is
instrumental in defending what is perceived as the nation's security.
The other extreme pole is militarism, meaning that the legitimacy for
using force is unquestionable or barely questionable. Militarism ranges
from regarding the use of force and the preparation for war as a normal
and desirable social activity,31 an approach that typifies many
industrialized democracies (and therefore is the definition used in this
article), to an irrational value system that espouses war as a goal in
itself.32 The degree of this legitimacy can be determined by monitoring
public opinion and political debates. However[, **public and elite
opinion and rhetoric can be more deeply analyzed as a multilayered
structure, which reflects deeper cultural constructs that are less
easily detectable. Focusing on the level of legitimacy for using force
moves beyond the narrow focus on the military's institutions, influence,
and resources, and the attitude toward the use of force to address
militarized political cultures that are often generated outside of the
military. Assuming that militarism is a socially and politically driven
phenomenon, the military is not necessarily the most salient part of the
political culture nurturing militarism**.]{.underline} When it is more
restrained than warmongering politicians, the influence of the military
does not result in militarization. Hence, **[an exclusive focus on the
military may be misleading]{.underline}**. The control of militarization
involves the political discourse in which the citizenry plays an active
and autonomous role. [This discourse aimed at subjecting the elected
civilians' use of force to a deliberative process that takes place
within the public and political arenas and addresses the legitimacy to
use force. Several conditions promote this deliberative
process]{.underline}: 1. Relative slowness in decision making to
guarantee that decisions are made through argumentation in which
everyone's opinion is in principle equally valuable and equally
fallible. As Huysmans held, such deliberation takes time and can always
be questioned again. Thus, speedy decision making in response to a
perceived threat thwarts this principle, strengthens the executive
branch of government, and suppresses dissent.33 2**[. Debates should not
be confined to the operational aspects of military policies but should
extend to the broader logic behind and rightness of such policies. In
other words, the debates should focus on the very legitimacy for using
force and its utility in promoting the public good]{.underline}**.34
Thus, **[the focus is on affecting the political cultures legitimizing
the use of force, rather than taking this legitimacy for
granted]{.underline}**. Therefore, during the debates there should be a
thorough consideration of nonlethal or less belligerent policy
alternatives. 3. **[Access to information is not obstructed by
manipulation, such as threat inflation]{.underline}**.35 4. Relatedly,
[debates should be conducted through an open discourse in which the
dominant discourse does not hinder the political opposition from
challenging decision makers]{.underline}.36 Such a dominant discourse
often takes the form of asserting the need for unity in times of crisis,
thereby muting dissenting voices.37 By extension, **[challenging the
decision makers should also challenge the power relations in society
that affect the legitimacy of using force and may create barriers to
deliberation.]{.underline}** In general, deliberation alone does not
necessarily ensure a more democratic outcome unless actors have other
power resources as well, such as the ability to mobilize to overcome
entrenched interests.38 This is why free and fair elections, along with
constitutional mechanisms such as checks on the power of each branch of
government, equality under the law and impartial courts, are
preconditions for the deliberative process.39

### FIAT K

#### Interpreting FIAT as simulation of USFG action destroys our agency in relating to the resolution -- turns deliberation and advocacy and reifies hegemonic ideologies- FAR forces debaters into engaging in praxis and method planning 

**Antonio 95** (Robert, July 1995, "Nietzsche's antisociology:
Subjectified Culture and the End of History", American Journal of
Sociology, Volume 101, No. 1)

[[Treating words as mirrors of reality]{.underline} [provides a
comforting illusion of]{.underline} \"[certainty]{.underline}]{.mark}.\"
[This]{.underline} [tendency obscures the social bases of language,
reifies social conventions, and weakens capacities to imagine and create
alternative conditions]{.underline}. Linguistic \"abbreviations\" cement
obligatory social ties where \"mutual agreement\" about \"feelings\" is
absent and the tendency to \"let go\" must be stemmed. Nietzsche held
that language serves [social selection of the herd, keeping experiences,
desires, impulses, and actions of weak persons within boundaries,
inscribing strong individuals as collective enemies]{.underline}, and
redirecting ressentiment into regimentation. Accordingly, [cultural
rationalization makes this process of liquidating particularity more
effective and universal]{.underline} (Nietzsche 1966, pp. 100---102,
216---17; 19686, pp. 357-58, 380). Since Nietzsche was himself a master
writer, his polemics about words per se are hyperbolic.11 The real
target is Socratic culture\'s exceptionally abstract languages, rampant
conceptual reifications, and impoverished aesthetic sensibilities.
Nietzsche believed [that [the obsession with rational representation
makes the body an inert target of disciplinary
control]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Adoration of concepts, theory,
and reason makes the abstract signifier the ultimate object of
knowledge[. [Purely formal concepts are treated as]{.underline}]{.mark}
[the \"highest,\" \"real,\" and \"[true]{.mark}\" things, [while sense
experience is relegated to the degraded status of
\"appearance.\"]{.mark}]{.underline} Platonic ideas, Chris- tian soul,
Kantian things-in-themselves, and Newtonian atoms and time are all
foundational reifications that \"dehistoricize\" the corporeal world and
erect illusions of firm \"grounds\" for those who cannot face life
without God and tradition or bear the weight of its connective choices
and its \"great dice game\" (Nietzsche 1974, pp. 287-90; 19686, p. 549;
19686, pp. 35-37). [Destroying Socratic culture\'s \"objective\"
foundations]{.underline} (i.e., God and Truth), the latest phase of
cultural rationalization greatly amplifies feel- ings of uncertainty.
[The consequent desperate searching and clinging produces frenetic
reification; fanatical new prejudices, religions, and politics appear
alongside the most sterile intellectual formalisms]{.underline}. Mass
culture\'s hastily formulated languages [blur all difference and
ambiguity]{.underline} (e.g., parties \"transform their principles into
great at fresco stupidities\"). The proliferation of abstract
signifiers, arising from diverse locations and detached from any sense
of stable referents, contribute to increasingly mechanical, diffuse, and
mindless regimentation. In this fashion, [Nietzsche severed the links
that modern theorists saw between rationalization and enhanced
communication, social integration, and legitimate authority]{.underline}
(Nietzsche 1983, p. 215; 1986, pp. 161-62; 1966, pp. 216-17; 19686, pp.
357-58, 380-81). [According to Nietzsche, the \"subject\" is Socratic
culture\'s most central, durable foundation. This prototypic expression
of ressentiment, master reification, and ultimate justification for
slave morality and mass discipline]{.underline} \"separates strength
from expressions of strength, as if there were a neutral substratum . .
. free to express strength or not to do so. [But there is no such
substratum; there is no \'being\' behind the doing, effecting, becoming;
\'the doer\' is merely a fiction added to the
deed]{.underline}\" (Nietzsche 1969b, pp. 45-46). [Leveling of Socratic
culture\'s \"objective\" foundations makes its \"subjective\" features
all the more important. For example, the subject is a central focus of
the new human sciences]{.underline}, appearing prominently [in its
emphases on neutral standpoints, motives as causes, and selves as
entities, objects of inquiry, problems, and targets of care]{.underline}
(Nietzsche 1966, pp. 19-21; 1968a, pp. 47-54). [Arguing that
subjectified culture weakens the personality]{.underline}, [Nietzsche
spoke of a \"remarkable antithesis between an interior which fails to
correspond to any exterior and an exterior which fails to correspond to
any interior]{.underline}\" (Nietzsche 1983, pp. 78-79, 83). The
\"problem of the actor,\" Nietzsche said, \"troubled me for the longest
time.\"\'12 He [considered \"roles\" as \"external,\" \"surface,\" or
\"foreground\" phenomena and viewed close personal identification with
them as symptomatic of estrangement]{.underline}. While modern theorists
saw differentiated roles and professions as a matrix of autonomy and
reflexivity, Nietzsche held that [persons]{.underline} (especially male
professionals) [in specialized occupations over identify with their
positions and engage in gross fabrications to obtain
advancement]{.underline}. [They look hesitantly to the opinion of
others]{.underline}, [asking themselves, \"How ought I feel about
this?\" They are so thoroughly absorbed in simulating effective role
players that they have trouble being anything but
actors]{.underline}-\"The role has actually become the
character.\" [This highly subjectified social self or simulator suffers
devastating inauthenticity. The powerful authority given the social
greatly amplifies Socratic culture\'s already
self-indulgent]{.underline} \"[inwardness]{.underline}.\" Integrity,
decisiveness, spontaneity, and [pleasure are undone by]{.underline}
paralyzing over [concern about possible causes, meanings, and
consequences of acts and unending internal dialogue about what others
might think, expect, say, or do]{.underline} (Nietzsche 1983, pp. 83-86;
1986, pp. 39-40; 1974, pp. 302-4, 316-17). [Nervous rotation of socially
appropriate \"masks\" reduces persons to hypostatized]{.underline}
\"[shadows]{.underline},\" \"abstracts,\" [or
simulacra]{.underline}. One adopts \"many roles,\" playing them \"badly
and superficially\" in the fashion of a stiff \"puppet play.\" Nietzsche
asked, \"[Are you genuine? Or only an actor?  A representative or that
which is represented?]{.underline} . . . \[Or\] no more than an
imitation of an actor?\" [Simulation is so pervasive that it is hard to
tell the copy from the genuine article; social selves]{.underline}
\"[prefer the copies to the originals]{.underline}\" (Nietzsche 1983,
pp. 84-86; 1986, p. 136; 1974, pp. 232- 33, 259; 1969b, pp. 268, 300,
302; 1968a, pp. 26-27). [Their inwardness and aleatory scripts foreclose
genuine attachment to others]{.underline}. [This type of actor cannot
plan for the long term or participate in enduring networks of
interdependence; such a person is neither willing nor able to be a
\"stone\" in the societal \"edifice\"]{.underline} (Nietzsche 1974, pp.
302-4; 1986a, pp. 93-94). Superficiality rules in the arid subjectivized
landscape. Nietzsche (1974, p. 259) stated, \"[One thinks with a watch
in one\'s hand, even as one eats one\'s midday meal while reading the
latest news of the stock market; one lives as if one always \'might miss
out on something. \'\'Rather do anything than nothing\': this principle,
too, is merely a string to throttle all culture]{.underline}. . . .
[Living in a constant chase after gain compels people to expend their
spirit to the point of exhaustion in continual pretense and overreaching
and anticipating others]{.underline}.\" Pervasive leveling, improvising,
and faking [foster an inflated sense of ability and an oblivious
attitude about the fortuitous circumstances that contribute to role
attainment]{.underline} (e.g., class or ethnicity). [The most mediocre
people believe they can fill any position, even cultural
leadership]{.underline}. Nietzsche respected the self-mastery of genuine
ascetic priests, like Socrates, and praised their ability to redirect
ressentiment creatively and to render the \"sick\" harmless. But he
deeply feared the new simulated versions. Lacking the \"born
physician\'s\" capacities, [these impostors amplify the worst
inclinations of the herd]{.underline}; [they are \"violent, envious,
exploitative, scheming, fawning, cringing, arrogant, all according to
circumstances]{.underline}. \" Social selves are [fodder for the \"great
man of the masses.\"]{.underline} Nietzsche held that \"[the less one
knows how to command, the more urgently one covets someone who commands,
who commands severely- a god, prince, class, physician, father
confessor, dogma, or party conscience.]{.underline} [The deadly
combination of desperate conforming and overreaching and untrammeled
ressentiment paves the way for a new type of tyrant.]{.underline}

### Hegemon DA

#### The reading of framework is a patriarchal move that attempts to push "unproductive" knowledge to the private or domestic sphere -- reject the neg the damage has already been done

**Tomlinson, 10**  (Barbara, "Feminism and Affect at the scene of
argument", Ch 1 -- transforming the terms of reading)

[Contemporary U.S. political and academic discourse abounds with a
recurring set of formulaic claims that feminist scholars]{.underline}
(and feminists in general) [are angry, unreasoning, shrill, humorless,
ugly, man- hating, perverse, and peculiar. This "trope of the angry
feminist" is designed to delegitimize feminist argument even before the
argument begins**, to undermine feminist politics**]{.underline} by
making its costs personal, and to foreclose feminist futures by making
feminism seem repulsive to young women. [The trope]{.underline} is a
convention, a plot trick, a setup, a narrative structure, a character
type. 2 Its incessant repetition [constitutes part of a cultural
training program that makes antifeminism and misogyny a routine element
in]{.underline} everyday [speech and]{.underline} written
[argument.]{.underline} Instigated by expressly po liti calopposition to
feminism, deploying affectively charged strategies that float free of
evidence, clichés like the angry feminist put animosity--- not
argument--- at the center of politi cal discussions, interpellating
readers as always already antifeminist. [The repetition and circulation
of such tropes produces a cumulative overdetermined quality that makes
them seem already true before the moment of argument. One never
encounters the feminist's argument for the first time because it comes
already discredited]{.underline}. Because the trope of the angry
feminist encourages unacknowledged ways of interpreting feminist affect,
its inveterate irruption is consequential in journalism, entertainment,
po liti cal, and quasi- intellectual arenas, as I describe in this
introductory chapter. It is perhaps even more consequential in its
influence on academic discourses, the subject of the remainder of the
book: **[affect in academic discourses on social justice is often
policed through "ideologies of style" that purport to be neutral but
operate to entrench current conditions of power.]{.underline}** In this
book I argue that **[we have failed to theorize adequately the role of
such pervasive affective and ideologically encapsulated arguments in
academic and political discourses]{.underline}**. In consequence, we do
not recognize that [our conventional reading practices mislead us about
ways to comprehend and counter them.]{.underline} I argue that
[transforming the terms of reading can reframe the problem, and propose
for that purpose a critical toolkit]{.underline} that I call "feminist
socioforensic discursive analysis." My argument here constitutes a
provocation to transform the terms of reading, to reframe interpretation
of affect in both feminist and antifeminist writing. Th e [trope of the
angry feminist is a familiar conceit,]{.underline} like many similar
phrases **[deployed to delegitimize social criticism]{.underline}**, one
that draws on a deep well of related clichés, affective rhetorical
strategies, and familiar tropes. Th ese discursive moves circulate as
instantiations of power. Th e trope of the angry feminist presents
itself as fresh each time it is uttered, its repetitious banality framed
as mere reflection of the repetitious banality of the feminist's
argument. Th is leads to the absurd but po liti cally effi cacious
situation where readers are weary of arguments they have never heard.
These argumentative tactics often succeed in part because our normal
reading and writing practices lead us to object or counterargue in ways
that fail to come to grips with the specific nature of the rhetorical
situation that the tropes instantiate. **[Our conventional reading
practices reinscribe ways of thinking that seem "logical" or "fair"
because they are so familiar]{.underline}**; **[they lead us to treat
the tropes as surface features of discourse that serve to "skew" debate
from its direct and proper form. These conventional practices, permeated
by unacknowledged power relations, encourage us to respond to the tropes
"normatively," with reproaches about textual etiquette, textual
responsibility, or textual appropriateness, to complain about inadequate
evidence, to provide counterexamples, or to condemn the person
proffering the trope, as though its use violates an agreement about the
proper nature of civic discussion,]{.underline}** and as if there is a
mechanism of accountability. None of this is the case. Responses that
might chastise, correct, or even complain about the trope of the angry
feminist are inadequate in part because they rest, ultimately, on an
imaginary ideal: a discursive arena regulated by impartial principles in
which utterances are adjudicated by unbiased observers. [Framing
political and]{.underline} even [academic discussion in this commonsense
way treats rhetoric as a neutral technology to be deployed or evaluated
in isolation from its conditions of production, the situations of
speakers, or the general societal power relations that give utterances
friendly to prevailing power relations an overdetermined
"reasonableness" while **rendering most oppositional arguments
automatically suspect**. Our]{.underline} reading [practices already
rest on uninterrogated and deeply gendered and racialized models

#### Their conception of switch side normalizes opposition as a narrative of completeness that shuts out feminist considerations of IR

[Sjoberg and Chessman 2012]{.underline} (Laura Sjoberg, PhD in IR from
USC and Professor at UF, and Christian Chessman, JD UC Berk, \"The
Biopower of Occupation: Insights for 'Knowledge Exchange'in (Gender and)
IR," November 17, 2012

(rishi)).

The second contribution we argue that "Occupy" as method could make to
feminist research is in understanding research more generally as being
stable in its liminality rather than anchored by a static certainty
about ontology, epistemology, method, or field politics. One way to
think about this might be thinking about IR as art, as Christine
Sylvester suggests: It takes an eye for sex and gender to see the art of
it all. Even then it is difficult. [Surrounded by enchanted positivism,
which promises progress in knowledge -- yes, this is the way! -- only a
long learning curve has brought us to the point of X-raying and
carbon-dating the facts presented as timeless tendencies, as 'objective'
I]{.underline}R. If we do not journey along the learning curve**[, we
end up trying to draw without looking, observing, and reckoning with
life.]{.underline}** (Sylvester 2002, 273) Sylvester is arguing that
**[seeing the world in a way that is linear, rational, and exclusively
scientific neglects a number of concerns which are normatively important
to feminisms, which find their substance in the political, the personal,
and the critical]{.underline}**. At the [same time, anchoring research
in liminality contradicts the discipline's anchoring in a positivist
social science based on approximating certainty.]{.underline} As
researchers, [liminality-as-research-goal is another uninhabitable space
in IR -- one which might be physically inhabited as an embodied
disruption of positivist social science -- one which might be a space of
otherness and a space of protest all at once -- both providing new
intellectual turf for IR and disrupting its
operationaliity.]{.underline} 29 Occupying Research to Occupy (Feminist)
IR We are interested in a number of ways that both [research practice
and the political landscape of the field might change as a result of the
introduction of the methodological principles for performing research
and navigating the field that we glean from the ideas and practices of
the 'Occupy' movement.]{.underline} In our view, [one of the most useful
questions such an interpretation can ask is how the space of the need to
'do/think things differently' becomes/became less
inhabitable/uninhabitable space in the discipline of IR/the practice of
governance, and how to inhabit that uninhabitable space,
methodologically for IR theory and practically for the world of
governance?]{.underline} In the paper (ready for posting soon), **[we
think of it in terms of the "perfect operationality" (in Baudrillard's
terms) of a simulacrum of 'what IR is' (or, in your terms 'how to
govern') where the system and its normalized 'opposition' form a tight
narrative of completeness that makes 'otherness' to it impossible. That
narrative completeness relies on bodies being where they are 'supposed'
to be (in Foucauldian terms about biopower being an enforcer of
sovereignty), and re-placement of bodies (occupation) interrupts the
narrative completeness of the imperium by demonstrating the
inhabitability of uninhabitable space.]{.underline}**

### Deliberation

**Their model of deliberation relies on a hegemonically masculine model

knowledge to the private or domestic sphere --**

[Tomlinson, 10]{.underline} (Barbara, "Feminism and Affect at the scene
of argument", Ch 1 -- transforming the terms of reading)

[Contemporary U.S. political and academic discourse abounds with a
recurring set of formulaic claims that feminist scholars]{.underline}
(and feminists in general) [are angry, unreasoning, shrill, humorless,
ugly, man- hating, perverse, and peculiar. This "trope of the angry
feminist" is designed to delegitimize feminist argument even before the
argument begins**, to undermine feminist politics**]{.underline} by
making its costs personal, and to foreclose feminist futures by making
feminism seem repulsive to young women. [The trope]{.underline} is a
convention, a plot trick, a setup, a narrative structure, a character
type. 2 Its incessant repetition [constitutes part of a cultural
training program that makes antifeminism and misogyny a routine element
in]{.underline} everyday [speech and]{.underline} written
[argument.]{.underline} Instigated by expressly po liti calopposition to
feminism, deploying affectively charged strategies that float free of
evidence, clichés like the angry feminist put animosity--- not
argument--- at the center of politi cal discussions, interpellating
readers as always already antifeminist. [The repetition and circulation
of such tropes produces a cumulative overdetermined quality that makes
them seem already true before the moment of argument. One never
encounters the feminist's argument for the first time because it comes
already discredited]{.underline}. Because the trope of the angry
feminist encourages unacknowledged ways of interpreting feminist affect,
its inveterate irruption is consequential in journalism, entertainment,
po liti cal, and quasi- intellectual arenas, as I describe in this
introductory chapter. It is perhaps even more consequential in its
influence on academic discourses, the subject of the remainder of the
book: **[affect in academic discourses on social justice is often
policed through "ideologies of style" that purport to be neutral but
operate to entrench current conditions of power.]{.underline}** In this
book I argue that **[we have failed to theorize adequately the role of
such pervasive affective and ideologically encapsulated arguments in
academic and political discourses]{.underline}**. In consequence, we do
not recognize that [our conventional reading practices mislead us about
ways to comprehend and counter them.]{.underline} I argue that
[transforming the terms of reading can reframe the problem, and propose
for that purpose a critical toolkit]{.underline} that I call "feminist
socioforensic discursive analysis." My argument here constitutes a
provocation to transform the terms of reading, to reframe interpretation
of affect in both feminist and antifeminist writing. Th e [trope of the
angry feminist is a familiar conceit,]{.underline} like many similar
phrases **[deployed to delegitimize social criticism]{.underline}**, one
that draws on a deep well of related clichés, affective rhetorical
strategies, and familiar tropes. Th ese discursive moves circulate as
instantiations of power. Th e trope of the angry feminist presents
itself as fresh each time it is uttered, its repetitious banality framed
as mere reflection of the repetitious banality of the feminist's
argument. Th is leads to the absurd but po liti cally effi cacious
situation where readers are weary of arguments they have never heard.
These argumentative tactics often succeed in part because our normal
reading and writing practices lead us to object or counterargue in ways
that fail to come to grips with the specific nature of the rhetorical
situation that the tropes instantiate. **[Our conventional reading
practices reinscribe ways of thinking that seem "logical" or "fair"
because they are so familiar]{.underline}**; **[they lead us to treat
the tropes as surface features of discourse that serve to "skew" debate
from its direct and proper form. These conventional practices, permeated
by unacknowledged power relations, encourage us to respond to the tropes
"normatively," with reproaches about textual etiquette, textual
responsibility, or textual appropriateness, to complain about inadequate
evidence, to provide counterexamples, or to condemn the person
proffering the trope, as though its use violates an agreement about the
proper nature of civic discussion,]{.underline}** and as if there is a
mechanism of accountability. None of this is the case. Responses that
might chastise, correct, or even complain about the trope of the angry
feminist are inadequate in part because they rest, ultimately, on an
imaginary ideal: a discursive arena regulated by impartial principles in
which utterances are adjudicated by unbiased observers. [Framing
political and]{.underline} even [academic discussion in this commonsense
way treats rhetoric as a neutral technology to be deployed or evaluated
in isolation from its conditions of production, the situations of
speakers, or the general societal power relations that give utterances
friendly to prevailing power relations an overdetermined
"reasonableness" while **rendering most oppositional arguments
automatically suspect**. Our]{.underline} reading [practices already
rest on uninterrogated and deeply gendered and racialized models
of]{.underline} textuality, [argument]{.underline}, authorship,
politeness, [and emotion]{.underline}. [Under such conditions, affect is
a potent tool of dominance,]{.underline} infusing the reading situation

### AT: K = Essentialism

#### No link and turn -- we don't assume men are inherently more aggressive than women -- the military creates this essentialism to serve its interests. We critique discourses that sustain notions of masculinity intrinsically tied to violence 

**Wilcox, 2010** (Lauren Wilcox, Lecturer in Gender Studies and the
Deputy Director of the Centre for Gender Studies at the University of
Cambridge, whose work is located at the intersections of international
relations, political theory, and feminist theory in investigating the
consequences of thinking about bodies and embodiment in the study of
international practices of violence and security. "Gendering the Cult of
the Offensive," in Gender and International Security edited by Laura
Sjoberg, p. 69 (SPP).

[[Some scholars have argued that men are more likely to make war than
women, because men are naturally aggressive]{.underline}.]{.mark} Wars
break out because men are in positions of political and military power.
Francis Fukuyama\'s 1998 Foreign Affairs article is an example of this
type of reasoning. If this logic were true, it could be argued that men
are likely to misinterpret the actual offense-defense balance because
their aggressive tendencies inspire them to seek out conflict. [[The
relationship between gender and aggression, however, is more
complicated]{.underline}]{.mark}. Claims of \"natural\" aggression in
men are politically suspect because they imply it is impossible for men
to be otherwise, and therefore ignore the many men who do not behave
aggressively. Joshua Goldstein finds little evidence that increased
levels of testosterone in men fuel wars, or that biological factors
explain the near-monopoly men have had on war-fighting throughout
history[. [Instead of blaming men\'s biological composition for state
aggressiveness, feminists in IR have identified military training and
the installment of martial values]{.mark} in men [as a source of
aggressive policies]{.mark}]{.underline}. Cynthia [[Enloe draws
attention to the myriad strategies associating nationalism and
masculinity that military recruiters have used around the world and
through time to encourage men to enlist, from promises of a fast-track
to \"first-class citizenship\" for racial minorities, to presumptions of
cultural superiority for groups already privileged]{.mark}. In the case
of World War I, a \"crisis of masculinity\" in Britain was incited by
the physical ineligibility of much of the working classes for military
service, resulting in widespread government intervention to produce a
nation of men more suited for the rigors of war deemed necessary to
maintain Britain\'s colonial empire and place in the world. Anxieties
over the ability of men to defend the nation prompted attempts to
reshape gender relations throughout society to encourage the
reinvigoration of traditional gender roles. [This evidence indicates
that rather than being inherently masculine, the military serves as an
important site for the creation and maintenance of gender identities in
society]{.mark}]{.underline}. As Enloe points out, \"If maleness,
masculinity, and militarism were inevitably bound together, militaries
would always have all the soldiers they believed they required.\"42
Viewing gender as an identity, as \"a socially imposed and internalized
lens through which individuals perceive and respond to the world,\"43
does a better job at explaining the underestimation of the costs of war
than theories of men\'s innate aggression.

### AT: K = Gender Binaries

#### Our theory of hegemonic masculinity does not rely on binaries but recognizes that a constructed conception of masculinity is privileged over other masculinities and femininities

**Wadley, 2010.** (Jonathan, PhD in IR from Florida and currently
professor of IR and sexual politics at San Diego. "Gendering the State:
Performativity and Protection in International Security," in *Gender and
International Security* edited by Laura Sjoberg, pp. 49-50, SPP)

Often, [[the qualities of gender norms are structured as dichotomous
pairs]{.underline}]{.mark}. As signifiers of identity, they establish
hierarchy among the actors upon which they are \"written.\" They
include, among other things: rationality/irrationality,
civilized/barbaric, autonomous/dependent, active/passive, and
powerful/weak-all of which map onto the dominant signifier pair of
masculine/feminine[. [The examination of gender dichotomies such as
these has been helpful in accounting for how unequal, relational
identities have been maintained and how they have privileged some actors
and marginalized other]{.mark}s]{.underline}. However, there are limits
to this kind of analysis[. By viewing relational gender identities in
dichotomous terms, one risks neglecting the variation that exists within
those categories]{.underline}. Simply put, there are different and
unequal types of masculinity and femininity. Within the range of
masculinities, there are dominant and subordinate types. [[A hegemonic
masculinity is an idealized, relational, and historical model of
masculinity-one to which other forms of masculinity are
subordinate.]{.underline}]{.mark} Although the qualities associated with
it characterize a small percentage of masculine actors, [[its
idealization and cultural pervasiveness require other actors to position
themselves in relation to it]{.underline}]{.mark}. And while it is
continually evolving, incorporating other forms of masculinity even as
it subordinates them, it remains identifiable. [[By performing in
accordance with a dominant model of masculinity, states can
constitute]{.underline}]{.mark} (and thus, position) [[themselves
relationally as powerful subjects]{.underline}]{.mark}. For Connell,
[this kind of positioning is at the heart of the concept of
[masculinity,]{.mark} to such a degree that the term \"[represents not a
certain type of man but, rather, a way that men position themselves
through discursive practices]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}\" Cynthia
Enloe argues similarly that patriarchy is perpetuated by "men who are
recognized and claim a certain form of masculinity, for the sake of
being more valued, more \'serious,\' and \'the protectors of/and
controllers of those people who are less masculine." A comparable
process occurs among states[. [As with men, the more that states are
able to constitute themselves in alliance with the norms of the
hegemonic masculinity the more they will improve their position and
boost their credibility. Thus, states have constant incentives to
perform in ways that not only are masculine but that constitute them as
a certain form of]{.mark} masculine [actor]{.mark}, one [who embodies
the elements of the hegemonic masculinity]{.mark}. Performances that
masculinize states by positioning them closer to the ideal of the
hegemonic masculinity are likely to be most effective in the realm of
security. This is because security performances are central to the
production of the state as a unitary subject and because, so often,
security performances are rendered intelligible by highly pronounced
ideas about masculinity and femininity. War, in particular, demonstrates
this claim]{.underline}. Long ago, Kenneth Waltz observed that in times
of war the state is united (and, therefore, a single entity) to a
greater degree than at any other time. Tickner makes a similar
observation but concludes that gender plays a big role in producing
state unity: [the state becomes a citizen-warrior in times of
war.]{.underline} Jean Bethke Elshtain and Susan Jeffords go one step
further, arguing that [collective identities are constructed through the
types of men and women that war creates or brings out.]{.underline} But
absent war, security performances are still crucial for state production
and reproduction. By taking dangers, threats, and other signs of
insecurity to be there objects, [security performances reproduce the
boundaries between a secure self and a dangerous other. Boundary
reproduction is central to processes of statecraft, and security
performances occur where the integrity of the state\'s boundaries are
discursively challenged]{.underline}, often in an explicit manner.
Whether such threats are internal or external, the effect is the same.
Indeed, the distinction often collapses. One effect of successful
security performances, then, is the appearance of the state as a
unitary, continuous actor, and one who can claim legitimacy over those
\"internal\" to it. An additional effect of successful security
performances is the constitution of the state as an actor who is
hierarchically dominant to certain other international actors,
frequently states. Both of these can be accomplished by performing
security in accord with the norms of the hegemonic masculinity. [The
relational quality of gender ensures that any performances that gave the
state the appearance of personhood will necessarily position its
personhood in relation to other states. [Any gendered construction of
the state, even if it does not live up to masculine ideals, will be
\"socially defined contradistinction from some
model]{.mark}]{.underline} (whether real or imaginary) [[of femininity;
thus, the gender norms that make a state intelligible as a subject also
situate it relationally to other actors.]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### Masculinity and femininity are culturally constructed -- masculine doesn't inherently dominate the feminine

**Workman 96** (Thom, Poli Sci @ U of New Brunswick, YCISS Paper no. 31,
p. 5, January 1996,
http://www.yorku.ca/yciss/publications/OP31-Workman.pdf)

[The gender critique of war]{.underline} provides a generalized account
of wars and the way they are fought. The gender critique tells us why we
have wars at all. While it is suggestive with respect to the frequency,
character, and scope of war, it does not try to account for the timing
and location of specific wars[. It tells us why war is viewed widely as
an acceptable practice or way to resolve human differences]{.underline}
(although this acceptance invariably is accompanied with obligatory
protestations of reluctance). The gender critique of war, for example,
cannot account for the timing and location of the 1991 Gulf War,
although it can provide an explanation of the warring proclivities of
modern Western states, especially the inconsistency between the peaceful
rhetoric of the US and its incessant warring practices. It can account
for the spectre of war in the aftermath of Vietnam, with the end of the
Cold War, and with the election of George Bush. It is less able to
account for the appearance of war in the Middle East in January of 1991.
The opening intellectual orientation of the gender critique of war rests
upon a constructivist view of human understanding and practice, that is,
a view that anchors practices, including war, within humankind\'s
self-made historico-cultural matrix. This view is contrasted starkly
with those that ground human practices psychologically or biologically
or genetically. [[War is not]{.underline}]{.mark} viewed as [[a natural
practice as if delivered by the Gods; it arises out of human-created
understandings and ways-of- living]{.underline}]{.mark} that have
evolved over the millennia. More specifically, the assumption that men
(the nearly exclusive makers and doers of war) are biologically
hard-wired for aggression and violence is resisted, as is the related
notion that women are naturally passive and non-violent. [[The
explanation for war will not be found in testosterone levels. It is not
the essential or bio-social male that makes war. War is the product of
the gendered understandings of life---understandings of the celebrated
masculine and the subordinated feminine---that have been fashioned over
vast tracts of cultural time]{.mark}.]{.underline} And [[since war
arises from human-created understandings and practices it can be removed
when these understandings change]{.underline}]{.mark}. [War is not
insuperable]{.underline}. Indeed, the rooting of war in human created
phenomena is recognized as a response to the political incapacitation
associated with biologically determinist arguments: \"Attempts of
genetic determinists to show a biological basis for individual
aggression and to link this to social aggression, are not only
unscientific, but they support the idea that wars of conquest between
nations are inevitable.\"8

## AT: UNIQUENESS PRESSES

### AT: Women are in politics

#### Their women in politics example doesn't disprove our argument that dominant politics operates via displays of hegemonic masculinity

[Maruska, 2010]{.underline}. (Jennifer Heeg, PhD in IR from Georgetown,
Lecturer in Political Science and Texas A&M in Qatar, "When are states
hypermasculine?" In Gender and International Security edited by Laura
Sjoberg, p. 248-251, SPP)

Conclusion: hypermasculine politics: [State behavior]{.underline} (by
foreign policy elites and within popular culture) [reflects hegemonic
masculinity, which is just one type of masculinity that occurs at the
top of a hierarchy of power relations]{.underline}. As previously
discussed, various forms of masculinities manifest on the international
stage, including hegemonic masculinity (of Western elites) and other,
subordinated masculinities (such as gay men, men of color; and
non-Western men), as well as many forms of subordinate femininity.
[Hegemonic femininity is perfectly sound as a theoretical concept, but
it is present only when \"feminine\" values dominate the social
structure under analysis. But insofar as states are \"manly,\" the field
of international politics is dominated by states with differing
hegemonic masculinities.]{.underline} American hegemonic masculinity\'s
most recent turn towards hypermasculinity is in stark contrast to
Germany\'s focus on economic primacy. But it does not matter whether
Gerhard Schroeder or Angela Merkel is at the helm: like all other
states, Germany must behave in a manly way in order to compete against
other manly states-and to survive in a feminine anarchy.67 [The point is
well theorized by now that \"when women enter politics, particularly in
areas of foreign policy, they enter an already constructed masculine
world where role expectations are defined in terms of adherence to
preferred masculine attributes such as rationality, autonomy, and
power]{.underline}. \"68 This is adherence to a generalized description
of hegemonic masculinity. What I propose as hypermasculinity goes
further than this, and refers to aggressive and bellicose behavior[. It
is possible that female heads-of-state may be more likely to adhere to a
hypermasculine hegemonic masculinity, in order to minimize their
anatomical female-ness]{.underline}. Television pundits make this point:
[Andrew Sullivan refers to Queens Elizabeth and Victoria, Margaret
Thatcher, and now Hillary Clinton as \"Warrior Queens.]{.underline} \"69
The concepts of hegemonic masculinity, and subordinate masculinities and
femininities, give this punditry (based on intuition and a specific
reading of history) real theoretical heft. [The field of international
politics in the US is dominated almost completely by straight white
men-or women who \"act like men\"]{.underline} (as is frequently said
about Hillary Clinton)\--[or by non-white men and women who conform (by
choice or necessity) to the culture of Washington]{.underline}. Even the
2008 election of President Barack Obama, unprecedented as it was, does
not fundamentally alter this reality. [After all, current First Lady
Michelle Obama\'s senior thesis at Princeton reflected on her
experiences as a Black American at an Ivy League university, stating
that \"the path I have chosen to follow by attending Princeton will
likely lead to my further]{.underline} integration and/or [assimilation
into a White cultural and social structure that will only allow me to
remain on the periphery of society; never becoming a full
participant.\"]{.underline} Furthermore, she continues in the next
paragraph, \"as I enter my final year at Princeton, I find myself
striving for many of the same goals as my White classmates.\" It remains
to be seen, but while some may hope that the Obama administration ushers
in an era where the particular strand of hegemonic masculinity is less
hypermasculine than it was immediately following 9/11, international
politics remains as imbued with hegemonic masculinity as ever.
Acceptable behavior in international politics transcends the
individual's race or gender; to get to a position of power[, all
participants]{.underline} (gay, straight, male, female, light or
dark-skinned[) must conform to the \"cult of \[hegemonic\]
masculinity.\"]{.underline} As Carol Cohn has showed us in the field of
nuclear strategy, \"learning the language is a transformative, not an
additive, process[.\" Heads of state must be perceived as strong on
national security; national security relies on war or the threat of
war.]{.underline} This is hegemonic masculinity in the extreme.
[Hegemonic masculinity is international politics, and international
politics is hegemonic masculinity]{.underline}. In the words of two
feminist theorists \"international politics is a process which is always
already gendered and which is maintained as gender-neutral only in
reducing gender to \'women\' and their particular concerns.\"73 [If
gender is not widely considered to be useful as a line of inquiry into
politics, it is only because politics are dominated so completely by the
mindset of hegemonic masculinity]{.underline}. As R. W. Connell wrote:

### AT: Women's Participation Increasing = Progress

#### **Increasing representation of women defers structural change and abets the system** 

**Griffin, 2015**. (Penny, Senior Lecturer in International Relations at
the University of New South Wales, Australia. "crisis, austerity and
gendered governance: a feminist perspective," in *feminist review* 109:
49-72, spp)

Essentialism has been no obstacle to the rapid uptake of the 'rise of
gender harmony' in governance discourse on finance. Frequently described
and represented as more responsible, nurturing, financially cautious and
intrinsically less corrupt (see, for instance, Stern, 2001; World Bank,
2001), [women have found themselves positioned]{.underline} in recent
discussions of financial crisis [as a solution to the excesses of
male-dominated finance, in a show of essentialism that governance
feminism has run with in its agenda for getting more women in
boardrooms]{.underline} and on trading floors. Economic observers have
frequently attributed the seeds of the global financial crisis 'to a
combination of reckless risk-taking and outright corruption' and, just
as 'risk-taking has been laid at the door of masculinity, so too has
corruption' (Fogg, 2013). Accordingly, women 'are simply more honest',
more trustworthy and public-spirited and less corrupt than men (ibid.).
They are also 'naturally' more prone to long-term thinking or empathic
and prosocial behaviour than men (ibid.). Policy-oriented studies have
emerged to demonstrate 'that including women is good for business' and
evidence has been marshalled to show that firms that promote women into
management are more profitable, better organised, accountable, motivated
and innovative (Prügl, 2012: 29). Making 'women's difference productive
for the solution of the crisis', such accounts have centralised women's
supposed patience, their consistence and their attention to detail
(ibid.: 30). Importantly, however (and in case men begin to feel
threatened by all this attention on women's gifts), these accounts have
redeemed men in finance by extolling women's contributions to profit in
conjunction with men's tendency towards extremes, painting women as
'competent associate\[s\] in a common endeavor' (ibid.: 31). Iceland's
efforts to 'signal a new culture within the banking system' (Wall Street
Journal, 2008), appointing female chief executives to the newly
nationalised Icelandic banks, serves as a good example of the extent to
which essentialist, and behavioural, explanations have monopolised
contemporary accounts of financial crisis. According to Salam, the
'macho men of the heavily male-dominated global finance sector' created
the conditions for global economic collapse', assisted by 'their mostly
male counterparts in government' (Salam, 2009: 68). Women, on the other
hand, are less inclined to 'risky' behaviour on financial markets
(except when menstruating; see Lite, 2008). As Elias (2013: 161) notes,
women's perceived carefulness as consumers (according to Global Gender
Gap reporting) also makes them better placed as managers of household
finances. According to the WEF, they are 'driving the
post-financial-crisis-economic-recovery' not only though their 'retail
power' but by 'engaging in acts of consumption that enable them to break
with traditional gender stereotypes in favor of an empowered gender
identity as consumer' (ibid.: 161--162). [Governance feminism's embrace
of the neo-liberal market guarantees that it firmly avoids questions
that might challenge the shape of the economic system that has led to
crisis. Governance feminism, and governance feminism's response to
financial crisis, has been extensively silent on the gendered
underpinnings of global governance, and global finance in particular,
focusing instead on a particular]{.underline} (and perhaps unsurprising)
[support for institutional measures to enhance women's
participation.]{.underline} The increasing prevalence of descriptions of
gender that directly correlate low gender gaps with high economic
competitiveness is, as Elias (2013: 159) notes, a powerful instrument of
governance, feeding into states' obsessions with their national economic
competitiveness and 'thus legitimating neoliberal competitiveness
enhancing policy agendas'. While it may be, then, 'no bad thing that an
organisation such as the WEF has placed gender prominently on its issue
agenda', since this can legitimate 'a focus on gender issues within
state and nonstate arenas and within international organisations', the
'inevitability about [the way in which gender issues are
instrumentalised in order to link women's empowerment and gender
equality straightforwardly to economic growth and competitiveness'
is,]{.underline} Elias notes, [troubling. 'By disappearing feminism in
favour of technical measurement and celebrity humanitarianism',
governance feminism simply reiterates problematic visions of gender
'whereby gender equality and women's empowerment' can be understood only
in relation to their 'ability to serve the market economy']{.underline}
(ibid.: 166--167).

his books that the "long peace" since World War II was not the result of
nuclear weapons, and argues that nukes are essentially "useless in
winning wars and in keeping the peace" since no country would dare to
use them: "Incinerating massive numbers of noncombatants would shred the
principles of distinction and proportionality that govern the conduct of
war and would constitute the worst war crimes in history. That can make
even politicians squeamish, so a taboo grew up around the use of nuclear
weapons, effectively turning them into bluffs." Of course, this means
the United States itself has committed the "worst war crimes in history"
since it intentionally dropped nuclear weapons on two civilian
populations. And [while there is certainly a "taboo" on such
behavior---Hiroshima horrified much of the world, though Americans tend
to think it was fine---U.S. commanders contemplated using nuclear
weapons in Vietnam, too]{.underline}. (Good thing Lyndon Johnson got a
bit "squeamish," although not so squeamish as to stop a war that killed
two million Vietnamese people.) [Realizing that the presence of
thousands of weapons that can vaporize cities, and the giant U.S. war
machine constantly researching terrifying swarms of autonomous flying
death robots, **rather undercuts the whole Most Peaceful Era Ever
theory,**]{.underline} [Pinker]{.underline} points to the fact that "the
United States has reduced its inventory by 85 percent from its 1976
peak." He concedes, however, that "[Cynics might be unimpressed by a
form of progress that still leaves the world with 10,200 atomic
warheads]{.underline}." Indeed, cynics might! The big problem with
[Pinker's violence thesis]{.underline} has always been that it
**[declares victory prematurely]{.underline}**. He is quite clear in
saying he doesn't think peace is necessarily here to stay, or that
progress can't unravel, and thinks this should silence critics who think
he is overly optimistic. But the truth is that **[we're just not far
enough past the end of World War II to begin to comment on a general
trend]{.underline}**. The two global bloodbaths occurred within the
lifetimes of people who are still alive. Over the course of human
history, this is a nanosecond. [It's not a "long peace," but a very
short one]{.underline}. One should probably not be drawing any
conclusions about what kind of era this is until we've seen a bit more
of it, otherwise [you might end up like the people who said World War
One had been the war to "end all wars]{.underline}." Others have pointed
out that [Pinker's worldview requires him to minimize]{.underline} some
pretty heinous **[violence, especially that perpetrated by the United
States]{.underline}**. (A good overview of this is found in the
International Socialist Review.) He trumpets Democratic Peace Theory
without much attention to the way the "democratic" U.S. has squelched
popular uprisings abroad that threaten its interests. He even goes so
far as to say: "Among respectable countries... conquest is no longer a
thinkable option. A politician in a democracy today who suggested
conquering another country would be met not with counterarguments but
with puzzlement, embarrassment, or laughter." Probably true, if they
said "conquering." If they said "liberating" or "spreading democracy
to," on the other hand, they'd be met with quite a different reaction!
[To avoid acknowledging U.S. aggression, he has to downplay the
hideousness of the Vietnam War, and mostly blames
"communists]{.underline}" for it, saying that "the three deadliest
postwar conflicts were fueled by Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese
communist regimes that had a fanatical dedication to outlasting their
opponents" and "the American democracy was willing to sacrifice a tiny
fraction of the lives that the North Vietnamese dictator was willing to
forfeit." [This exoneration of the U.S. for the Vietnamese deaths is
downright despicable, and Pinker needs to get himself much better
acquainted with the reality of what we did.]{.underline} Naturally,
Pinker is more critical of anti-nuclear activists than of the military
industrial complex. "Stop telling everyone they're doomed," he warns.
"The message that many antinuclear activists want to convey is 'any day
now we will all die horribly unless the world immediately takes steps
which it has absolutely no chance of taking." And after all, "the world
has survived half-mad despots with nuclear weapons before, namely Stalin
and Mao, who were deterred from using them, or, more likely, never felt
the need." Very reassuring. (He also points out that "war is illegal.")
Illustration by Mike Freiheit What's maddening about
[Pinker's]{.underline} body of recent [work]{.underline} is that it
[attacks the very people who are doing the most to address the problems
he says he cares about.]{.underline} **[Progress is made by
progressives]{.underline}**, as Jeremy Lent pointed out, and it's
yesterday's "social justice warriors" that are responsible for the
declines in racist language and corporal punishment that Pinker shows
off as accomplishments of Our Great Liberal Democratic Capitalist Order.
[The Pinkers of times past were the one Martin Luther King was
addressing in Letter From Birmingham Jail, who placed trust in the
"benevolent forces of modernity" to make things better rather than
actually taking part in a social movement]{.underline}. As my friend Sam
Miller McDonald put it, "most of those good things that Steven Pinker
likes to brag about came about because of the hard work and sacrifice of
the kind of people Steven [Pinker]{.underline} likes to complain about."
Indeed, Pinker is quite open that he doesn't believe in "struggle." He
views political problems as "mistakes," errors to be corrected through
the application of rationality, rather than "conflicts" between values
and interests. He wants to "depoliticize issues as much as possible" and
"treat politics as science, engineering, or medicine." This is why he
[refuses to see that certain kinds of power are zero-sum, that the
interests of the boss does not coincide with the interests of the
worker]{.underline}. That would mean that advancing the interests of the
worker required a political fight, rather than simply the application of
technology. This is the Obama worldview, and [the Obama presidency
proved why it doesn't work]{.underline}. [It turns out that interests do
conflict, and that if you try to take actions that enrich working people
and threaten corporate power, the people whose power is threatened will
do **everything they possibly can to destroy you**]{.underline}. Steven
[Pinker's works]{.underline} are worth examining for a few reason. For
one thing, they sh**[ow how deeply conservative a "liberal" worldview
can be]{.underline}**. Pinker is all for Equal Rights, Democracy,
Sensible Regulation, Secularism, and the other great Liberal values. And
yet [like many liberals, he seems to detest the left more than the hard
right]{.underline}. ([He infamously praised the "highly literate, highly
intelligent" alt-right.]{.underline} Then when he was criticized, he
said: "A lot of people who are ignorant of the alt-right equate them
with the skinheads and the Nazis carrying the tiki torches, I was
referring to the alt-right strictly from its origins in internet
discussion groups." So, not Richard Spencer, but... Richard Spencer?)
[He]{.underline} simply [accepts the right-wing narrative of various
events]{.underline}. This often shows up in small framing comments.
Bernhard Goetz was "a mild-mannered engineer" who "became a folk hero
for shooting four young muggers," not a vigilante who attacked four
Black men after one of them asked him for money. (I've never looked up
what Pinker thinks of James Damore, but I'm sure he thinks he was an
intelligent young man fired for reporting the uncontroversial results of
scientific studies.\*) [He partly defends the Tuskegee syphilis
study]{.underline}, calling it a "one-time failure to prevent harm to a
few dozen people," that "may even have been defensible by the standards
of the day" (It was actually 400 people that the United States
government allowed to believe they were being treated for syphilis when
they weren't, and it lasted 40 years.)

## AT Poetry Bad

#### Poetry is important to form a politics of engagement where we can challenges the contemporary issues of our world

Joan **Retellack** and Juliana **Spahr 06** ("Introduction: Why Teach
Contemporary Poetries?" *Poetry and Pedagogy: The Challenge of the
Contemporary*)

Educational institutions like to think they know where they are going
and that\'s why the word pedagogy has an almost irretrievably pejorative
cast. The old-fashioned specter of pedagogy as a kind of psychological
and moral teleology marching toward ideals of compliant good citizenship
had hardly been outmoded before its anti-authoritarian replacement began
to look suspiciously benighted and equally manipulative. The student who
must question all authority must become the ultimate skeptic and
therefore, paradoxically, cannot assume a critical stance toward the
pedagogy of self.expression s/he is offered as an instrument of freedom.
In the maw of this dichotomy between power as knowledge and
student-centered learning, the very things that matter-\~-the informed
imagination, the passionate intellect-\_can be swallowed whole. We are
not attempting with this book to invent a new pedagogy, but to suggest
that [education must be in touch with the historical-contemporary
intersection that forms the world in which we live.]{.underline} This
can happen in many ways. [What poetry has to offer is a compound
experience in which the dynamic engagement of self and otherness, of
formal discipline and experiment, is played out through the
foregrounding of language.]{.underline} [Every word, every combination
of words, strikes us like a chord on multiple levels of intellect and
emotion. Language is the site of cognitive modeling and intuitively
nuanced play. The conceptual framework of this book draws
on]{.underline} Wittgenstein\'s sense of [language as a form of life,
language games as the repertory of our human action\--a repertory that
profits from continual reinvention, and becomes stalled in thoughtless
habitual usage.]{.underline} It also benefits from John Dewey\'s idea of
art as experience and D. W. Winnicott\'s crucial distinction between the
active imagination at play and the passive retreat into fantasy.
Winnicott, like Dewey, believes that imaginative engagements with our
world are responsible for not only our sense of reality but our zest for
life. Winnicott argues that our most important life-affirming active
principle is our capacity for that high-stakes engagement with the
concrete materials of existence that we call play.\* Whether in
literature or the sciences, it is the playful mind that experiments and
discovers. Gertrude Stein\'s (playful) argument that in our arts we are
literally composing the time in which we live brings into focus the
poetical urgency of what we value most in our uses of language. Our
contemporary experience is both alarmingly and exhilaratingly
complex\--chaotic, excessive, messy. It demands an intricately informed
agency, new ways to perceive and invent patterns, the ability to make
mean-ing in motion. It is polylingual and perverse, full of delightful
and nefarious artifice. As editors of this volume, we believe that [the
contemporary poetries of which the many authors represented here write
can enliven our capaci-ties to make sense of where we are, where we want
to go in medias rest of the world as we find it.]{.underline} If
poetries that are truly in touch with their times are the pleine air
laboratories of the language, what are the pedagogical implications? The
essays in Poetry and Pedagogy assume that [the functional mandate of the
humanist classroom is to bring students into engagement with that part
of their world negotiated through texts.]{.underline} Few would deny
that the [contem-porary has been the chronic blind spot in all but
scientific and fine arts cur-ricula]{.underline}. Think how many
\"twentieth century lit.\'survey courses still can\'t fit much in after
the mid 1950s. In fact, the greatest challenge facing the Liberal Arts
has always been the contemporary. (Stein liked to say that the official
\"we\" is always about forty years behind what is actually going on in
the arts.) The question therefore is how to invent a living poetry
class-room, one that invites students to experience and make meaning of
the forms of their era. This at the very least requires cognizance of
the plurality of poetries har come out of our blatantly \"multi\"
world-multicultural, ethnic, racial, religious, linguistic. The essays
collected here address the productive possibilities, pleasures, and
risks of teaching intercultural poetries of the sort that have
proliferated since the 1960s. [Avant-gardes (i.e., innovative
contemporary arts of all sorts) have tended to be not only pedagogical
in their implications, but also international in their interests. An
immediately obvious pedagogical impli-cation has to do with ways in
which these poetries demand an active making of meaning on the part of
the reader\--a performative dimension that enacts a significant
linguistic agency.]{.underline} In today\'s world [that agency must be
broadly informed and multifaceted]{.underline}. Having gone from the
perhaps overly opti-mistic concept of the global village to increasing
concerns about the politics of globalization, a contemporary poetics
cannot be limited to the narrowly expressive 1-poem, nor the conceptual
formalist poem, nor to fragmented language and syntax or paratactic
riffs, nor to single rhythm, loudly declaimed spoken poetry. Any \"I\"
from whom one has something to learn must be in conversation with an
unsettling mélange of \"others.\" The conversational intimacy of the
internet, along with its nonmaterial location in cyberspace, has brought
on a particular strain of the Brechtian formula for art that acti-vates
agency: empathy and estrangement. These can also be viewed as qualities
of the reflexive hybridization that has become a distinguishing mark of
our times. However one construes all this, the fact is, from the early
1990s on, national and international conversations have flourished among
any of the poets represented in this book. The geometries of their
attention radiate in many directions.
