# Aff -- OCOs 3 -- BFHR

### notes

Thanks a ton to Sam Gordon and Paul Wallace for their work this wave!
Please email <khirn10@gmail.com> with any comments or concerns.

Many cyber affs\-\--including OCOs and space\-\--clearly have
interactions with the 'Article 5' debate. I figured that 1acs should
have the option of explicitly designing their plan to include an attempt
at pressuring NATO to agree on appropriate Article 5 thresholds for what
constitutes an armed attack with regards to cybersecurity. The aff/neg
file is thus designed as a supplement, with defensible and distinct
impact mods both for and against changing the threshold.

The DAs in this file are essentially deterrence and assurance, the links
assuming the aff attempts to establish some cyberattacks as falling
short of meeting the threshold of 'armed attack'. The "Lower A5
Threshold" DA is meant for a hypothetical aff that **lowered** the
Article 5 threshold, functionally saying "all cyberattacks are armed
attacks and we will respond accordingly." The aff material in "OCOs 3"
doesn't support this angle, but I could envision somewhat putting it
together.

4\. INTERNATIONAL LAW AND NATO CYBER DEFENCE POLICY

What role has international law played in the evolution of NATO's cyber
defence policy? And what influence might NATO's cyber policy decisions
have on the international law applicable to cyberspace?

\(a\) Applicability of International Law to Cyberspace

Perhaps [the most straightforward way in which]{.underline}
[international law has played a role in]{.underline} [NATO's cyber
policy evolution]{.underline} [has been in the Alliance's]{.underline}
**[constant affirmations]{.underline}** [of the applicability
of]{.underline} **[international law in cyberspace]{.underline}**. As
explained above, at the NATO Summit in Wales [in 2014]{.underline},
[Allies recognised that international law]{.underline}, including
international humanitarian law and the UN Charter, [applies in
cyberspace]{.underline}. More recently, at the Brussels Summit in July
2018, allies re-affirmed their commitment to act in accordance with
international law, including the UN Charter, international humanitarian
law, and human rights law, as applicable.

[These statements were part of a broader movement of]{.underline}
**[cyber diplomacy]{.underline}** conducted by States, international
organisations, and non-governmental organisations. [That effort had some
notable successes]{.underline} at the international level, including the
2013 and 2015 reports of the UN Group of Governmental Experts.56
[However]{.underline}, [this consensus proved to be
**tenuous**]{.underline}. Currently [some States]{.underline}, among
them China and Russia, [are pushing back on the]{.underline} [very
notion of the]{.underline} **[applicability of international law
principles]{.underline}**, including the applicability of international
humanitarian law, **[in cyberspace]{.underline}**.57 [Many NATO Allies
are attempting to counter these attempts to dismantle]{.underline}
previous [consensus]{.underline}. [Their techniques include detailed
legal statements]{.underline} of a series [of how international law
applies in cyberspace]{.underline}.58 [However]{.underline}, [while the
number of]{.underline} States making such [statements is slowly
growing]{.underline}, [it]{.underline} [still remains]{.underline} a
[small]{.underline} number that of course does not include all NATO
allies. In this context, **[language]{.underline}** like that **[adopted
at NATO]{.underline}** [can be useful as evidence of where **all NATO
allie**]{.underline}s and likeminded States currently
**[stand]{.underline}**.59 [These]{.underline} and similar
[statements]{.underline} in other international organizations [may help
with]{.underline} **[ongoing cyber diplomacy]{.underline}**.

\(b\) Article 5 and Armed Attack

[International law considerations have also factored into]{.underline}
[NATO's cyber policy in relation to]{.underline} **[Article
5]{.underline}** of the North Atlantic Treaty. As mentioned above, the
2014 Wales Summit contained the basic policy decision regarding the
interplay between cyber attacks and the international law concept of
armed attack: 'We affirm therefore that cyber defence is part of NATO's
core task of collective defence. [A decision as to when a cyber attack
would lead to the invocation of Article 5]{.underline} [would be
taken]{.underline} by the North Atlantic Council [on a case-by-case
basis]{.underline}'. Article 5 is the self-defence provision at the core
of the North Atlantic Treaty.60 It refers back to Article 51 of the UN
Charter, which itself reflects the 'inherent' right of self-defence
under customary international law. In NATO's practice to date, Article 5
has been treated as coterminous with the customary right reflected in
Article 51.61 All of these formulations revolve around the notion of
armed attack.

From an international law perspective, [NATO's policy illustrates at a
minimum that a cyber attack could constitute an armed
attack]{.underline} giving rise to the right of individual or collective
self-defence under international law. [It]{.underline} clearly [does not
say that all]{.underline} [cyber attacks would rise to this
level]{.underline}. [Nor does it provide any]{.underline} [further
guidance on]{.underline} [important international law
questions]{.underline}, [such as the]{.underline} **[threshold for an
armed attack]{.underline}**. For example, [the policy does not refer to
the]{.underline} well-known [analysis that an armed attack must attain
a]{.underline} **[certain level of scale and effect]{.underline}**. That
analysis features prominently in a range of judicial decisions62 and in
scholarly commentary.63 [Nor does it seek to address]{.underline} some
of the **[debated questions]{.underline}**. [These include whether an
attack]{.underline} '[having severe albeit]{.underline} [neither
injurious nor physically destructive effects]{.underline}
[could]{.underline} [ever constitute an armed attack]{.underline}
[and]{.underline}, if so, [under what circumstances']{.underline}.64

From a policy perspective, the primary reason for this lack of detail
about what would constitute an armed attack is straightforward. It is
seen as strengthening the deterrence value of NATO's posture. The NATO
Secretary General has said: 'I am often asked, "under what circumstances
would NATO trigger Article 5 in the case of a cyber-attack?" My answer
is: we will see. The level of cyber-attack that would provoke a response
must remain purposefully vague'.65 In any event, as the policy makes
clear, the decision to invoke Article 5 would be taken on a case-by-case
basis. This decision would be taken by the North Atlantic Council on the
basis of consensus of all Allies. Whether or not an armed attack has
occurred is a question of fact and law. NATO does not prejudge the
threshold for an Article 5 decision. This would be a political decision
in which a wide range of factors, including but not limited to legal
advice, would be considered by the North Atlantic Council."

If Article 5 were invoked in response to a cyber attack, the Alliance's
collective response would also be decided on a case-by-case basis by the
North Atlantic Council. The legal obligation on Allies under Article 5
is set forth in the North Atlantic Treaty:

> each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective
> self-defence recognised by Article 51 of the Charter of the United
> Nations, will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking
> forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such
> action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to
> restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area.66

This is an obligation of assistance to the State or States that are the
victim of the armed attack. [The Treaty does not specify what
actions]{.underline} th[e attacked State's Allies are under an
obligation to take.]{.underline} Rather, [it requires each Ally to
take]{.underline} '[such action as it deems necessary]{.underline},
[including]{.underline} the use of **[armed force]{.underline}**, to
restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area'. The text
specifies that this is actions for all each ally to take both on its own
and together with ('in concert with') other Allies.

[It is]{.underline} **[impossible to predict what might
happen]{.underline}** [if NATO]{.underline} Allies [were to decide that
a future cyber attack crosses the]{.underline} armed attack
[threshold]{.underline} in Article 5. The exact collective response
would be decided on a case-by-case basis by the North Atlantic Council.
This could include the use of force in exercise of the right of
individual or collective self-defence. Such a use of force would not
necessarily be limited to the cyber domain and could include action in
other domains. As Secretary General Stoltenberg put it, NATO's response
under Article 5 'could include diplomatic and economic sanctions,
cyber-responses, or even conventional forces, depending on the nature
and consequences of the attack'.67 Finally, given the text of Article 5,
it is possible that in addition to the collective response agreed by
consensus, individual States would take action that they deem
appropriate.

\(c\) '[Below the Threshold' Incidents]{.underline}

[Since the vast majority of cyber incidents occurs]{.underline} [below
the]{.underline} armed attack [threshold]{.underline}, [international
lawyers have had to think about the]{.underline} **[peacetime legal
framework]{.underline}** [for responses]{.underline} [to such malicious
cyber activity]{.underline}. [NATO's recent work has
included]{.underline} '[a NATO guide that sets]{.underline} out a number
of [tools to further strengthen NATO's ability to respond to
significant]{.underline} malicious cyber [activities']{.underline}.68
[However]{.underline}, [this is]{.underline} document is [not publicly
available]{.underline}, so it is difficult to assess what its contents
may indicate on some of the key questions that arise in responding to
internationally wrongful acts against the Alliance or individual Allies.

In response to future incidents, [Allies may wish to use NATO as a forum
to]{.underline} **[coordinate multilateral responses]{.underline}** to
such responses, [or as a means of **requesting assistance**]{.underline}
with their own responses. In the case of a serious incident, [one option
would be to request consultations under]{.underline} **[Article
4]{.underline}** of the North Atlantic Treaty. Article 4 provides that
'\[t\]he Parties will consult together whenever, in the opinion of any
of them, the territorial integrity, political independence or security
of any of the Parties is threatened'. [Article 4 has only been
explicitly been called upon in a handful of situations during NATO's
history]{.underline}, [none of which]{.underline} has been [focused on
cyber]{.underline}.69 It is certainly possible that future malicious
cyber activity could constitute the kind of threat to territorial
integrity, political independence or security envisioned by Article 4.
However, it is not necessary to use Article 4 in order for NATO to take
action to deal with any given incident.

[Close attention to NATO's future responses to]{.underline} '[below the
threshold' cyber incidents]{.underline} [may **yield**]{.underline} some
**[insight on a range of international law questions]{.underline}**. For
example, [given NATO's collective defence mandate]{.underline}, [one
question is whether States will be willing to consider NATO]{.underline}
[as a means to conduct]{.underline} collective
**[countermeasures]{.underline}**. At the time of writing, [some Allies
appear to have]{.underline} **[different views]{.underline}** [on
whether collective countermeasures are a **legally available
option**]{.underline} under international law.70

Finally, some NATO allies have developed a practice of using public
identification of the perpetrators of malicious cyber activity as a
means of countering that activity. This practice is referred to as
attribution. As the Brussels Summit declaration put it in 2018,
'\[i\]ndividual Allies may consider, when appropriate, attributing
malicious cyber activity and responding in a coordinated manner,
recognising attribution is a sovereign national prerogative'.71 There is
an increased trend of States making attributions, either unilaterally or
in concert with others.72

\(d\) Providing a Forum for Expressing Legal Views

As an international organisation, [NATO does not create international
law or other norms]{.underline} that regulate State behaviour. [While
NATO's cyber practice to date may help shed light on some questions of
international law]{.underline} (or at least help stimulate thinking on
these questions), [there would be little appetite]{.underline} among
Allies and in the broader international community [for NATO to take a
lead role in driving]{.underline} such [debates]{.underline} forward.73
Put another way, NATO does not see itself as a norm-creating
institution. At the same time, [as a well-established multinational
intergovernmental organisation with a considerable amount of practical
experience on cyber defence issues]{.underline}, [NATO can often provide
a]{.underline} **[good vantage point]{.underline}** [not just for
emerging State practice]{.underline}, [but for]{.underline}
**[encouraging it to be expressed]{.underline}**.

[More and more States have been]{.underline} making public [statements
of their views of how international law applies in cyber
space]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} process [should be
encouraged]{.underline}. [One of the advantages of NATO]{.underline} [is
that it provides a forum for]{.underline} daily **[multilateral
discussions]{.underline}** and exchanges of views [on]{.underline}
**[cyber defence]{.underline}**. NATO is also a way for Allies that have
not yet taken a view on a subject can express support or alignment with
positions of other Allies. Regular meetings at the ministerial and even
Head of State and Government level provide an opportunity for Allies to
make clear public statements. In addition, [NATO has the convening power
to host regular]{.underline} high-level [interaction between government
cyber policy experts]{.underline}, [lawyers]{.underline}, [academics and
industry representatives]{.underline}. Sometimes sponsored and led by
individual Allies, these are initiatives that can take a holistic
approach by bridging the legal, political, and military domains.
Finally, [NATO also conducts regular multilateral cyber
exercises]{.underline}, [often with a legal component or designed so as
to raise legal questions]{.underline}. [Properly designed]{.underline},
[multilateral cyber defence exercises]{.underline} [that engage the
highest level of]{.underline} government [decision makers could help
clarify State practice]{.underline}. [Leveraging all of these advantages
may help generate]{.underline} more **[clarity on the international
legal framework]{.underline}**.

5\. CONCLUSION: FUTURE CHALLENGES FOR NATO CYBER DEFENCE POLICY

NATO's cyber policy evolution over more than two decades has been a
prime example of how the Alliance has adapted to new threats. What
challenges can NATO expect in future cyber policy? And how can NATO's
traditional approach to legal issues pertaining to cyberspace help the
alliance address these challenges? In the future, the trajectory for
NATO's cyber defence policy work will continue to be shaped by the
threat environment as it evolves and will likely follow the direction
indicated by existing work as the alliance seeks to further strengthen
the cyber defences of the alliance itself and those of individual
allies, deter cyber activities directed against NATO and its allies, and
respond to future incidents.

[The future cyber threat]{.underline} environment [will be equally if
not more intense than NATO sees today]{.underline}. For example, cyber
defence will need to become increasingly powered by artificial
intelligence in order to respond to AI-powered attacks.74 Especially as
technology evolves, the cyber domain of operations will become more
central to -- and more integrated with -- other domains. For example, in
December 2019, NATO Heads of State and Government declared outer space
as NATO's newest domain of operations.75 There is a strong link between
outer space and cyber.76 If the intensity of attacks and their potential
impact on all domains continues to increase, one future outcome would be
for Allies to be interested in stronger responses to them. Whether
Allies prefer to do this individually or on a bilateral or 'small group'
basis, or whether they will seek out stronger collective tools for the
alliance is an open question.

[Given Allies' commitment to the rule of law]{.underline}, [compliance
with international law will]{.underline} continue to [be a]{.underline}
**[cornerstone of NATO's cyber policies]{.underline}** in the future.
[The challenge will be how to **ensure that other actors**]{.underline}
in the international system, both State and non-State, **[comply as
well]{.underline}** [and whether the broad cooperation]{.underline}
among like-minded States [that has been developing]{.underline} in
numerous venues **[can be sustained]{.underline}** in the long term.77
[Pressure for more]{.underline} **[collective action]{.underline}**
against cyber attacks and malicious cyber activities [may well raise the
stakes on some]{.underline} of the open [legal questions]{.underline}
that have been on NATO's agenda. [One recommendation would be for allies
to continue their ongoing legal dialogue]{.underline} [on questions such
as]{.underline} [the]{.underline} armed attack **[threshold for Article
5]{.underline}**, [the types of response measures available]{.underline}
for malicious cyber activity **[below the armed attack
threshold]{.underline}**, [whether]{.underline} [techniques like
countermeasures are available]{.underline} [not just for use by an
individual victim]{.underline} State [but also for collective
use]{.underline}, and others. Technological developments may also lead
to more calls for legal dialogue. For example, [since applications of
artificial intelligence and machine learning for]{.underline} use in
[cyber defence have already made their way onto NATO's
agenda]{.underline}, [there will]{.underline} likely [be demand
for]{.underline} **[multilateral ways of responding to
them]{.underline}**. Another recommendation would be for more dialogue
on the legal framework for the use of such technologies.78 Legal
dialogue on these forward-looking issues might help bring allies closer
together, not only in the legal area but in broader cyber policy terms.

Second, the distinction between an IAC and a NIAC in a hybrid warfare
setting will depend on evidence of state attribution, which will be a
difficult and highly political issue. State denial policy and covert
operations by provocateurs, Private Military Contractors
(**[[PMC]{.underline}]{.mark}**) or Private Military Security
Contractors (PMSC) like the Wagner Group, mercenaries in terms of
non-state conventional forces and state special forces (SOF) provoking
the uprising of the civilian population [[is a **central part
of**]{.mark} **the [hybrid war]{.mark}fare**.]{.underline} If one adds
to this evidential legal uncertainty, the ICJ and ICTY dispute about
whether one should apply a high degree of \"effective control\" or a
lesser degree of \"overall control,\" the legal picture of a possible
perfect hybrid scenario becomes visible. The strict
[[ICJ]{.underline}]{.mark} requirement of \"effective control\" in the
Nicaragua case seems less convincing as it legally [[allows states to
use non-state actors in the gray zone]{.underline}]{.mark} where these
strict conditions and proof thereof cannot be met. The arguments
presented by the ICTY in the Tadi? Appeal case against the view of the
ICJ seem persuasive, if alleged \"lawful\" interventions by third states
and hybrid campaigns through private non-state actors should be reduced
and prevented:

A first ground on which the Nicaragua test as such may be held to be
unconvincing is based on the very logic of the entire system of
international law on State responsibility.

The principles of international law concerning the attribution to States
of acts performed by private individuals are not based on rigid and
uniform criteria \... The rationale behind this rule is to prevent
States from escaping international responsibility by having private
individuals carry out tasks that may not or should not be performed by
State officials, or by claiming that individuals actually participating
in governmental authority are not classified as State organs under
national legislation and therefore do not engage State responsibility.
In other words, States are not allowed on the one hand to act de facto
through individuals and on the other to disassociate themselves from
such conduct when these individuals breach international law. The
requirement of international law for the attribution to States of acts
performed by private individuals is that the State exercises control
over the individuals. The degree of control may, however, vary according
to the factual circumstances of each case. The Appeals Chamber fails to
see why in each and every circumstance international law should require
a high threshold for the test of control. Rather, various situations may
be distinguished. 114

The disagreement between the ICJ and ICTY on the attribution of acts by
non-state actors to a state was reinforced by the subsequent ICJ
judgement in Genocide case 2007, where for the purpose of deciding state
responsibility, the ICJ confirmed the Nicaragua \"effective control\"
test and, moreover, expressis verbis, rejected the ICTY jurisprudence.
115With the ICJ jurisprudence, the attribution test for the purpose of
conflict classification may well be the ICTY \"overall control\" test,
which according to the ICJ could be applicable and suitable. However,
this test does not persuade for the purpose of state responsibility.
This introduces two different quality tests, which adds another legal
layer of complexity: a state can instigate an IAC by having \"overall
control\" of acts of non-state actors, but simultaneously avoid state
responsibility for the acts of those non-state actors as the \"effective
control\" test is not met. The ICJ logic of the possible application of
difference attribution tests for conflict classification and state
responsibility seems questionable and critical, at least from a hybrid
warfare perspective. Moreover, from a general perspective, it seems
unconvincing and, thus, questionable that the \"overall control\" test
is unsuitable and in the view of the ICJ stretches too far, almost to a
breaking point, the connection which must exist between the conduct of a
State\'s organs and its international responsibility. The restrictive
[perception of the ICJ on state responsibility seems [out of tune
with]{.mark} the factual [needs]{.mark} and]{.underline} the
\"[requirements]{.underline} of international life\" [[to]{.mark} be
able to legally [counter]{.mark}]{.underline} strategically willful and
unlawful [[hybrid threats]{.underline}]{.mark} and warfare.

The experience in East Ukraine speaks for itself. The threshold
(\'trigger\') for an international, armed conflict (IAC) involving more
than one state, and the threshold for state responsibility are not only
difficult to demonstrate with reliable evidence, but also covered with
legal uncertainty. In addition, there may exist a lack of appetite to
declare an IAC at the strategic political level and thereby risk an
escalation and a possible ad hoc activation of collective self-defense.

C. Specific Legal Challenges or \"Gaps\" in jus ante bellum by Hybrid
Threats and Warfare

A hybrid threat or warfare kept under the threshold of an \"armed
attack\" and below the intensity or organizational requirement for an
internal \"armed conflict\" (NIAC) will pose critical challenges to a
peacetime law enforcement regime, as it will be conducted by inter alia
indirectly employed non-state actors and covert state agents, by
provoked opposition from own and foreign citizens, by cyber-attacks, and
by the use of information campaigns utilizing fabricated or switched
fake news.

Such a hybrid threat or warfare is often coupled with a firm denial
policy of any immutability and attribution of such activities to a state
initiating and de facto controlling the hybrid campaign. The integrated
hybrid information campaign merely portrays a public picture of civilian
movements consisting of \"normal\" people being dissatisfied with the
current political regime in power and the society conditions in general.
With the legal requirement of attribution in the sense of the
\"effective control\" test or the relaxed \"overall control\" test being
disputed, and clear evidence thereof likely either ignored without legal
effect or covered by hybrid information campaign, a continued hybrid
threat and warfare with both kinetic and non-kinetic means is possible
without high, or much, political or legal risks. 116

The emerging problems with the principle of distinction just add to
this. Military clothing has become popular and trendy among civilians,
as paramilitary uniforms are seen more often in the streets. Regular
armies have been seen to disrespect traditional uniform codes and permit
self-equipment of soldiers in combat zones, missions or on exercises.
Moreover, uniforms, accessories and insignia of different states are
becoming more similar and hard to distinguish, even at a close distance.
117 The possible and recommendable remedy is, on the one hand, that
military forces consider distinction by choice of design and uniforms
and, on the other hand, that military discipline of wearing those
regular uniforms when on duty is re-enforced.

If all these circumstances come together in a law enforcement scenario
in peacetime or crisis, there will be several legal constraints and
[[restraints in]{.mark} the [jus ante bellum]{.mark}]{.underline}, which
[will [**create legal vulnerabilities** for both]{.mark} the
[victim]{.mark} state[s]{.mark}]{.underline} (host nations) [[and states
sending]{.mark} armed forces for [assistance]{.mark}, deterrence
purpose, and countermeasures.]{.underline} Some of these will be
addressed below.

a\. Limits set by the national domestic law enforcement regime and HRL

1\. Respect of Receiving State (Host Nation) Law and Political System

The deployment and presence of foreign military forces are conditioned
on the consent by the host nation as the territorial law of the host
nation decides whether foreign military units may enter the state
territory ( jus ad praesentiam) and on what conditions ( jus in
praesentia). This consent can be given ad hoc prior to each individual
deployment, or in general, as part of a defense agreement and standard
status of force agreements. The NATO SOFA applies to the \"force\" and
\"civilian component\" accompanying a force in the territory of another
NATO alliance state, whether stationed or in transit. 118 Under the NATO
SOFA and usually under any other standard or ad hoc agreed SOFA, the
foreign forces and civilian component thereof have an obligation under
treaty law \"to respect the law of the receiving state and to abstain
from any activity inconsistent with the spirit of\" the standard or ad
hoc agreed SOFA. 119 Moreover, the forces of the sending state (also
termed \"Troop-Contributing Nation,\" TCN) shall not interfere with the
internal political affairs of the receiving state and, in particular,
take necessary measures to avoid \"any political activity.\" 120 As will
be discussed subsequently, the latter will be of relevance by measures
to counter informational hybrid activities as any such activity by
foreign forces to promote a certain political view and NATO policy may
be held to constitute \"political activity,\" infra V.A(d).

Hence, the host nation\'s political governance and law enforcement
remain intact. Foreign forces are stationed in the country only for the
purpose of military exercises, planning, and deterrence measures with,
as a starting point, little or no legal competence to conduct counter
hybrid operations in peace time and crisis.

2\. Possession and carrying of arms by foreign forces and contractors

For any conduct of military exercises, deterrence measures, hybrid
counter operations, clarity on the laws and directives for the handling
of weapons and ammunition is vital. In this regard, military forces are
well-educated and trained to be particularly careful and observant.

According to the NATO SOFA, members of a \"force may possess and carry
arms\" if so authorized by orders whereby \"sympathetic consideration to
request\" from the host nation shall be made. 121Arguably, although the
wording for the NATO SOFA only mentions \"arms\" and, hence, strictly
speaking \"weapons,\" an interpretation in accordance with the context
and object and purpose of the provision would include both weapons and
ammunition. 122The possession and carrying of weapons/ammunition will be
governed by the sending states\' (TCN\'s) law, military regulations on
weapons and ammunition, and the specific directives and orders given to
their forces, but still, due regard shall be had to the host nation
regulations as well. 123

By multi-national forces stationed in a host nation, different military
regulations regarding weapons and ammunition may apply. Moreover, the
national requests may differ in the various host nations concerned, such
as in the Baltic states, Poland, Germany and Denmark. For a
multi-national Headquarters, such as the MNDN, with a distributed
\"Headquarters East\" in Denmark and a \"Headquarters West\" in Latvia
and ongoing duty travel between the two permanent locations, the host
nation\'s legal framework would differ and change constantly. The
varying regulations on weapons and ammunition will create legal
complexity and administrative obstacles and, thus, may hamper timely and
effective reactions to a hybrid campaign. There are good legal and
operational reasons to conclude separate multi-national SOFAs on the
question of arms and ammunition in peacetime and crisis and align the
legal framework of both sending and receiving nations. 124 The \"gap\"
in the NATO SOFA regarding specific directives for handling arms and
ammunition would thereby be closed.

Under Article II of the NATO SOFA, there are two important limitations
on the right which state that members of a \"force may possess and carry
arms\" if so authorized by orders.

Firstly, the granted right under the NATO SOFA that a \"force may
possess and carry arms\" is thus exempted from the host nation\'s public
law regulations on weapons and ammunition as it only applies to the
forces in their performance of military duties in accordance with the
authorization by orders, 125where the sending states (TCNs), in
principle, maintain primary jurisdiction under the NATO SOFA. 126 When
not acting on duty, restrictive public rules on weapons and ammunition
in the host nation may apply, such as the Danish prohibition to import,
produce, collect, purchase, possess, carry and use any kinds of weapons,
including specific knives, without authorization. 127 More flexible and
relaxed weapon regulation for possessing and carrying arms off duty are
usually enforced in other NATO alliance countries, inter alia, the
Baltic states and in particular in the U.S. This is a practical and
legal concern in the jus ante bellum that military personnel in
peacetime and crisis will be temporarily off duty, or on leave, and in
that timespan be subject to perhaps unknown, strict weapons regulation
in the host nation, and in principle punishable for any violation
thereof under the receiving state\'s (host nation) law and jurisdiction.
For foreign troops present in other NATO states, the determination of
when a person is \"on duty\" or \"off duty\" may not always be easy. In
any case, members of foreign forces will have to be educated and trained
in legal compliance with the host nation\'s law and regulations. 128 In
a hybrid campaign, foreign troops are a more vulnerable target for
provocation, threats, attacks, and media exposure while \"off duty,\"
and acts in violation of the host nation\'s law may be exploited by a
hybrid propaganda campaign.

Secondly, [the right under the [NATO SOFA]{.mark} to \"possess and carry
arms\" [only applies to members of a force]{.mark} and **[not]{.mark} to
[civilian]{.mark} component[s]{.mark}**,]{.underline} family members or
sending state contractors, **[[including
PM]{.mark}S[Cs]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Again, host nation law applies,
and the host nation maintains primary or exclusive jurisdiction[. If

3\. Use of force and self-defense by foreign forces

AA) THE SOFA \"GAP\" ON THE USE OF FORCE

Neither the NATO SOFA nor the UN Model SOFA address the question of the
source, scope and application of the use of force in self-defense by
foreign forces present on foreign territory. This is a significant
\"gap\" in the standard SOFA regulation.

Rarely do specific bilateral SOFAs deal with this vital question. The
detailed US/Poland SOFA 2009 and the SOFAs between the U.S. and the
Baltic states concluded in 2017, do not address this issue.
Additionally, separate multi-lateral or bilateral SOFAs for major
exercises are normally silent on the issue of use of force and
definition of self-defense. 132 An exception to this silent feature of
SOFA regulations is found in the NATO/German SOFA 1954 concluded after
the end of the occupation regime following the Second World War, where
the permanent stationing of troops in the former West Germany was
regulated. The NATO/German SOFA 1954 (now Revised Supplementary
NATO/German SOFA 1993) requires that the sending state may authorize
\"civilian component and other persons employed in the service of the
force\" to possess and carry arms. However, regarding the use of arms it
must \"issue regulations, which shall conform to the German law on
self-defense ( Notwehr) on the use of arms.\" 133

BB) THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN PERSONAL AND STATE (UNIT) SELF-DEFENSE

The most restricted legal basis for the use of force is self-defense,
which constitutes a generally recognized inherent right of all persons
and, in addition, of all states, their organs and armed forces pursuant
to Article 51 of the UN Charter and customary international law. However
alike, the two forms of self-defense must be strictly distinguished.

The right to personal self-defense derives from the national law
applicable and HRL. It is codified in most national laws and constitutes
a necessary corollary to the right to life under HRL. However, regarding
the source, scope and application the right differs decisively under
various national laws.

The right to state individual or collective self-defense derives from
public international law and is, pending differences in interpretation,
in principle uniform. It is a right vested in a state, its organs and
armed forces, and, thus, includes self-defense of the state armed force
(force self-defense), the so-called \"unit self-defense\" or the defense
of a single soldier in service and performing military duties. 134The
exercise of force, unit or soldier self-defense will follow military
orders and directives, including ROE, where a unit and soldiers can be
ordered not to open fire, cease-fire or withdraw even if the conditions
for state (unit) self-defense under international law are fulfilled.
Moreover, force self-defense is usually a standing order in terms of an
obligation (military duty) and not just an \"inherent\" right. On the
contrary, the right to personal self-defense is generally seen as an
inherent right of a person, which cannot be limited by military orders
or directives. 135

Hence, in any discussion of \"self-defense,\" this divide between
personal self-defense under national law and HRL, and force (unit)
self-defense as part of the right to state self-defense under
international law must be kept in mind.

Regarding the use of force and self-defense by foreign forces, the
inherent right to personal self-defense is, on the one hand, assumed to
be governed by territorial law of the receiving state (host nation)
albeit special agreements between the states concerned. As part of the
right of state self-defense, the right of force/unit self-defense is
governed by international law. The exercise of it depends on how de
facto this is implemented in the law and policy of the sending state and
its military orders and directives. In principle, it does not make any
difference whether this right is exercised on foreign territory.
136Illustrative in this regard is the Danish Royal Standing Order 1952
(still in force) to all Danish armed forces and personnel that in case
of an armed attack on the territory of Denmark or on Danish military
units, including Danish forces present outside Danish territory, Danish
forces must engage in combat without delay and without awaiting or
requesting an order, even when there is no knowledge of a declaration or
state of war. 137It is expressly stated that false orders and
information not to mobilize, resist and interrupt fighting are expected,
and as such may not be followed before there is necessary proof of these
being issued by competent authorities. 138

CC\) RIGHT TO POLICE AND TO ENSURE ORDER AND SECURITY

In the limited regulation on the use of force in the NATO SOFA, \"the
right to police\" and to \"take appropriate measures to ensure the
maintenance of order and security on such premises\" is accorded to
foreign military units and formations inside camps, establishments or
other premises occupied by foreign forces. 139It is not defined what
exactly is covered by a right to police and to maintain order and
security and what kind of use of force is permitted to that end. The
SOFAs between the U.S. and the Baltic states further extend the right
and authority of the U.S. as a sending state and authorize the U.S. on
host nation territory to exercise all necessary rights and authorities
for the use, operation, defense, or control of premises, including
taking appropriate measures to maintain or restore order. Hence, by
these SOFAs, the U.S. is entitled to exercise all rights and authorities
necessary in defense of premises and take appropriate measures to
protect U.S. forces, U.S. contractors, and dependents. 140However, it is
not addressed whether the use of force in exercising all rights in
defense and taking appropriate measures to protect U.S. forces, U.S.
contractors, and dependents are governed by host nation law or U.S. law,
including a presumably more extensive right to personal self-defense
under U.S. law.

Outside such premises, according to the NATO SOFA, any employment of
foreign military police or force is subject to arrangements with the
receiving state (host nation) and only in so far as such employment \"is
necessary to maintain discipline and order among the members of the
force.\" 141For other purposes, the maintenance of internal law and
order is entirely the host nation\'s competence and task. Nevertheless,
the receiving state has the obligation to seek such legislation as it is
deemed necessary to ensure the adequate security and protection of the
foreign forces. 142

DD) THE DILEMMA OF PERSONAL AND STATE SELF-DEFENSE IN MULTINATIONAL
OPERATIONS

When the use of force is not regulated in the NATO SOFA or a separate
supplementary SOFA, the territorial host nation law will apply and
determine the extent to which personal self-defense may be used by
members of foreign military forces, civilian components, dependents, and
contractors. The inherent right to personal self-defense is universally
recognized, but the threshold for an attack or imminent threat of attack
to life or causing of serious personal injury varies, just as the
possibility to use force in self-defense of others and for the
protection of property differs, and the proportionality and necessity
requirement can be very strict or to a wide degree relaxed. 143

If based on an agreement the law of the sending states applies, the
multi-national forces and Headquarters will face a multiplicity of
personal self-defense concepts, and the host nation may have to accept
the use of force in self-defense on its territory beyond what its own
national law permits. Conversely, if the law of the receiving states
(host nation states) applies, there will also be more concepts by
cross-border operations and distributed Headquarters and, rather
critical, some sending states such as the U.S. will see their national
definition of personal self-defense narrowed down \-- perhaps to an
unacceptable degree.

This constitutes the dilemma of personal self-defense in multi-national
operations, which, in principle, is unsolvable. There is no expectation
that a law harmonizing the personal right to self-defense will see the
daylight in a near or foreseeable future at a global or even regional
level. One will have to choose between one of the two options of
applying either the law of the sending states (TCNs) or the law of the
receiving states (host nations). In NATO, the first path of referring to
the sending nation law regarding personal self-defense has been chosen.
Here, the ROE do not limit the inherent right to self-defense under
national law by forces under NATO command and control of foreign
territory. 144This approach may be adopted at a national level in the
ROE issued for peacetime and crisis by a host nation or agreed upon by
separate SOFAs, which then allows foreign forces to use force in
accordance with their own national concept of personal self-defense. 145

Until unity of allied command is established by a Transfer of Authority
(TOA) from each nation to a common military command such as NATO, the
national formations and units will operate under national command and
directives regarding the use of force. This means that various national
ROEs and policies of state (force/unit) self-defense will apply in a low
threshold hybrid warfare theater. The example of the NATO enhanced
Forward Presence (eFP) in the Baltic states and Poland is illustrative;
as of October 2019, the four multinational battalions consist of
rotating troops and staff members from twenty-one countries and four
host nations with consequently multiple policies and interpretations of
force/unit (state) self-defense being applied. 146

This constitutes the dilemma of state (force/unit) self-defense in
multi-national operations and will be the status of the jus ante bellum
and jus in bello until there is a TOA to NATO by all nations involved.
When the allied headquarters is in command, it can and likely will
authorize and issue common ROE, which depending on the situation can
have a defensive or (perhaps dormant) offensive character. 147 By such
ROE, the differences in the national concepts of personal and force
(unit) self-defense can be leveled out by, inter alia, the use of ROE
requiring hostile act and hostile intent for the use of minimum but up
to lethal force. The use of force against persons, units or groups
showing hostile act and hostile intent (perhaps including \"hot
pursuit\') will be in line with the concept of personal and force (unit)
state self-defense of some states and clearly excessive when compared to
national law and directives of others.

The TOA decision is a critical national political matter and the TOA
over national armed forces may come under conditions and, thus, include
reservations and caveats. It is only likely to be granted by states just
prior to or immediately after activation of individual and collective
state self-defense. In a national crisis and in cases of small-scale
armed hostilities with non-state actors and armed groups in parts of the
territory of an alliance state only, the territorial states concerned
may wish to retain command and control of national armed forces and,
thus, for the time being refuse TOA. This disregarding whether the armed
hostilities fall below or exceed the threshold for a NIAC, where in the
latter NIAC scenario, according to the prevailing and convincing view,
the LOAC applicable for a NIAC extends to the entire territory of the
states concerned.

Another and recommendable option \-- even though presumably politically
difficult \-- would be for all states concerned, to agree on common ROE
applicable in peacetime and crisis when taking part in NATO reassurance
measures, either by ad hoc agreements or a supplementary SOFA, and
thereby filling the decisive \"gap\" in the NATO SOFA in the time prior
to TOA to NATO command.

4\. Military Assistance and Support to Law Enforcement and Crisis
Control

The receiving state (host nation) has the sole responsibility and
competence regarding internal security and law enforcement. However, the
host nation can permit, and upon consent receive support from law
enforcement in peacetime and crisis from the military forces and
civilian component of another state present on its territory. The
military forces of the sending states have limited authority, which is
confined to maintaining law and discipline in designated military
facilities, areas, and among members of their forces. Further authority
is not granted under the NATO SOFA and only exceptionally given in
separate bilateral SOFAs. In Article 29(2), the US/Poland SOFA 2009
authorizes exclusively U.S. operations outside such designated areas for
the purpose of protecting U.S. forces and dependents:

Upon request of either Party and with the consent of the appropriate
authorities of the Republic of Poland, United States military
authorities may operate outside of the agreed facilities and areas in
order to ensure security of United States forces and dependents. During
such operations, United States military authorities shall use clear
identification of their special status, and they shall immediately
contact the appropriate authorities of the Republic of Poland and shall
act consistent with their instructions. 148

The legal framework in the host nation, including the applicable HRL
constraints and restraints, and the limits for military support to civil
law enforcement must be clarified. In addition, the sending states\'
(TCN\'s) possible reservations and caveats regarding supporting
operations must be adhered to as well. In any event, such foreign
military support requires, not only specific military and police
training, including legal training, but in particular mutual trust
regarding the performance of law enforcement (police) tasks. The host
nation and TCNs\' caveats may concern the possible military support in
the first place and, if allowed, the specific conditions regarding,
inter alia, police command and control, detention, and use of force in
personal or unit self-defense, in defense of others (civilians),
military equipment, and facilities. Each nation will presumably have
adopted its own legal regime for the military support to police and law
enforcement in peacetime and crisis, which will be designed and shaped
by the national tradition and culture and, thus, constitute a sui
generis regime for each nation. Consequently, an intensive legal
training of incoming foreign forces regarding the host nation\'s
peacetime or emergency law, including the impact of TCN\'s reservations
and caveats, should be made. With the constant routine of in- and
outgoing foreign multi-national forces every third to sixth month in the
territories of the NATO states, placed geographically at the hybrid
threat or warfare frontline, this will be a demanding, time-consuming
and complex task.

In summary, while the NATO SOFA permits alliance state forces to be
present and carry arms on the territory of the receiving host nation,
any assistance and support to a host nation\'s law enforcement by other
states military forces, including the use of force, must be in
accordance with the host nation\'s peacetime and human rights law. While
in times of unrest and crisis, national military force may be empowered
to perform law enforcement tasks under police and/or military command,
foreign forces must be especially authorized by both the sending nation
and the host nation to do so.

A practicable solution \-- but also a rather radical and politically
sensitive one \-- would be to accord to foreign NATO forces the same
authorization to use force in support of police law enforcement as given
to national forces at any point in time. This is the stage of Latvian
law and, thus, the host nation policy at the East Headquarters of MNDN.
As a general statement, the Latvian national rules on the use of force,
including rules on escalation of the use of force, apply to foreign NATO
forces present in Latvia. 149Thus, Latvian law permits foreign NATO
forces to wear uniforms, carry and use weapons in the same way as
Latvian National Armed Forces, and accord them with the relevant rights
of the Latvian National Armed Forces. This includes the right to
individual self-defense under Latvian law, defense of other persons and
to avert an attempt to violently obtain a service firearm. When foreign
forces take part in military guard duties or perform other official
tasks such as support to the police law enforcement in times of
emergency or crisis, they will be authorized to use force in the same
manner as Latvian armed forces. If the sending states approve such a
support by their armed forces, there will be alignment in the peacetime
and crisis Standing Rules for the Use of Force (SRUF). 150Compared with
the law of other states, the use of force permitted by the armed forces
according to Latvian law could be viewed as excessive in peacetime.
However, it signals a necessity to employ military force against certain
hostile and armed activities on the frontline of hybrid threats and
warfare already in peacetime and crisis. The same result in terms of
alignment of the ROE is reached under Lithuanian law by the application
of the peacetime Lithuanian Force Protection ROE 2017 by virtue of
separately agreed MOUs with the sending states of eFP forces, however,
with respect of the application of the personal self-defense according
to national law of the foreign armed forces. 151

Turning from the East Headquarters of MNDN in Riga, Latvia, to the MNDN
West Headquarters in Denmark, the use of force in peacetime and crisis
is entirely a national police task with a possible exclusive supporting
role by Danish armed forces. The possibility for the police to request
military support from Danish armed forces (but not foreign armed forces)
was extended in 2018, but it is still quite limited. It can be provided
regarding a wide range of specific tasks only under the strict
conditions that the resources and capabilities of the police are
insufficient, that supporting operations are under police command and
control, and that the rules governing the competence and the use of
minimum force by the police are followed. 152With the amendment of the
Police Act in 2018, it was made possible to designate specific military
areas for, inter alia, NATO re-enforcement forces, the outer security of
which are secured and guarded by Danish military forces only, and not by
foreign forces. 153

In case of an escalation of a crisis in terms of increasing unrest,
riots and armed hostilities below or even above the \"armed conflict\"
threshold for a NIAC, deviation from the normal peacetime law
enforcement regime may follow a step-by-step or at once enacted national
emergency (martial) law and/or escalation steps taken collectively by
the defense alliance concerned.

b\. Different National Emergency (Martial) Law Regime and Possible
Derogation from HRL

The Baltic states and Poland have been on the frontline of the Russian
hybrid threat and warfare for years and have adapted their national
legislation and planning on emergency, mobilization, re-organization of
governance, civilian support, preparedness and resistance to meet the
hybrid challenges. 154In addition, Poland and the three Baltic states
have entered into bilateral SOFAs with the U.S. in 2009 and 2017, which
supplements the NATO SOFA, and facilitates the presence of U.S. forces.
155Other NATO or PfP states without specific bilateral SOFAs or MOUs are
left with the standard NATO SOFA and its \"gaps\".

Some of the most important issues to be dealt with in the various
national emergency (martial) laws or ad hoc emergency regulations
regarding national and foreign forces are the following: First, the
conditions for possession and carrying of weapons and ammunition. When
on duty, temporally on leave or \"off duty\', military personnel may
need to possess and carry weapons and ammunition as the security
situation may require military personnel and civilian components to be
able to defend themselves at all times. Second, the use of force beyond
mere personal self-defense or unit self-defense when encountering
hostile hybrid activities until TOA and common NATO ROE will apply.
Here, the Latvian regulation aligning the use of force by national and
foreign forces seems to represent a model to follow. 156 Third, the
conditions for own national, bilateral or NATO military support to law
enforcement (the assist/support role). Fourth, the need for legal
education and training of all personnel on exercise in peacetime and
crisis scenarios. This should be prioritized as military forces will
have to operate under a certain national law enforcement regime and
apply the peace time and emergency law of the respective host nations.

The national regulatory approach to a state of emergency or a state of
exception vary from state to state. Here again, a comparison with the
legal state of affairs in Denmark and the Baltic states show a striking
difference, although the countries apply the concept of total state
defense.

Under Danish law, the maintenance of law and order, including law
enforcement, in peacetime and crisis is exclusively the competence of
the civil police with possible support by the Danish armed forces. This
is where civilian and military efforts will be coordinated by local
authorities and the National Operative Staff (\' Den Nationale Operative
Stab\', the so-called NOST) on an ad hoc basis. 157The entire joint
operation will be conducted under the police law enforcement regime and
the use of force applicable in this context. 158There is no national
regulation or law on emergency (martial law) which governs and regulates
the emergency and crisis situations as such. For an international
military staff and its legal advisors in Headquarters such as the MNDN
in Denmark/Latvia, this creates legal challenges as the exact content of
the a d hoc legal regulations and directives in emergency situations to
some extent is uncertain.

Under Latvian law, as well as under Lithuanian and Estonian law, the
state of emergency and state of exception is expressly regulated in a
specific emergency or martial law, which provides clarity and allows for
prior planning accordingly. 159The \"State of Exception\" in Latvia as a
special legal regime can be declared if: 1) the State is endangered by
an external enemy; 2) internal disturbances which endanger the
democratic structure of the State have arisen or are in danger of
arising in the State or any part thereof.\' 160The latter situation
includes civilian unrest, riots and internal conflicts even though this
may fall below the threshold of an internal \"armed conflict\" (NIAC).
161Upon a declaration of a \"State of Exception\', the reasons, time,
territory, set of measures, restrictions and additional duties of
civilians, the tasks of state and local authorities and information to
and recommendations for actions of inhabitants must be stated. 162

As HRL still plays an important role in case of national emergency and
crisis, the possible derogations of applicable human rights law regimes
in times of national emergency and war is a viable and necessary option
for states, in order to ensure compliance with constitutional rights and
HRL treaty law. 163However, this may result in different national
derogations and, thus, an even wider discrepancy of the content of the
host nation\'s emergency (martial) laws and more legal complexity.
164Hence, member States of defense alliances such as NATO should seek to
align their possible derogation from the HRL regime applicable, in
particular regarding those states which are bound to the same regional
HRL treaties. According to the \"derogation clause\" contained in HRL
treaties, a derogation from most provisions is possible:

In time of war or other public emergency threatening the life of the
nation \... may take measures derogating from its obligations under the
Convention to the extent strictly required by the exigencies of the
situation, provided that such measures are not inconsistent with its
other obligations under international law. 165

Not permissive under any circumstances is a derogation from the
provision concerning the right to life (Article 2 of the ECHR), except
in respect of deaths resulting from lawful acts of war, the prohibition
of torture and other forms of ill-treatment (Article 3 of the ECHR), the
prohibition of slavery or servitude (Article 4(1) of the ECHR) and no
punishment without law (Article 7 of the ECHR). 166When the threshold of
an \"armed conflict\" has been exceeded and the LOAC applies, the
special LOAC regime will determine whether lethal use of force is
lawful. 167

This is not the place for a detailed analysis of the conditions and
validity of possible derogations from, inter alia, the ECHR in time of
\"war and other public emergency\'. Nevertheless, from the military
legal advisor\'s point of view, both the de facto declared and possible
future derogations, their content and validity should, if possible, be
considered in planning and executing military operations in a hybrid
crisis and potential armed conflict. Here, it suffices to allude to some
of the legal \"gray zones\" by the interpretation of the HRL
\"derogation clauses.\"

First, the term \"war\" in Article 15(1) of the ECHR has not been
subject to interpretation by the European Court of Human Rights, but
should be held to equal the definition of an \"armed conflict\" in the
meaning of the LOAC, whether a NIAC or an IAC. For the purpose of a HRL
derogation, a \"conflict\" below the threshold of an \"armed conflict\"
will mostly constitute a situation of \"other public emergency
threatening the life of the nation,\" where the European Court of Human
Rights has deferred to the national authorities\' prima facie assessment
as to whether such an exceptional situation exists with subsequent
judicial appreciation. 168 Second, a HRL derogation can be made for a
part of the state, where the \"armed conflict\" or an actual or imminent
crisis in terms of \"other public emergency threatening the life of the
nation\" exists. 169 Third, and most importantly, it is up to each
individual Contracting State, responsible for the life of its nation, to
determine whether the life of the nation is threatened by a \"public
emergency.\" Thus, it is presumably the individual, receiving state
(host nation) which for its territory or a part thereof will have to
declare a HRL derogation. 170

c\. The Dilemma Regarding Use of Private Contractors and Civilian
Resistance

[The use of]{.underline} state contractors ([[PMC]{.underline}]{.mark}
or PMSC) and the use of civilians for the support of military operations
is a delicate legal matter for various reasons.

The employment of state contractors [raises the issues of [lack]{.mark}
of **[c]{.mark}**ommand a**[n]{.mark}**d **[c]{.mark}**ontrol, lack of
disciplinary competence, insurance of [compliance with]{.mark} national
peacetime laws and]{.underline}, when applicable, the
**[[LOAC]{.underline}]{.mark}**, operational security and [jurisdiction
issues]{.underline}. Some states are reluctant regarding the use of
PMSC, others require compliance with specific vetting procedures, and
others may have a general state policy of not using private companies
for any military and security tasks in peacetime and crisis, 171and
involving direct participation in hostilities in case of an armed
conflict. 172Hence, there may be requirements from sending states (TCNs)
for the use of their own PMCs or PMSCs such as U.S. contractors as well
as host nation caveats in this regard. [An important \"gap\" in the NATO
SOFA is present regarding this issue. It may be dealt with differently
in various]{.underline} specific [bilateral SOFAs. When an opponent [in
a hybrid info]{.mark}rmation [campaign]{.mark} is systematically
exploiting mistakes, the possible [misconduct]{.mark} and illegal acts
[of PMC]{.mark}]{.underline} and PMSC employed to be a sending state and
positioned out of reach of the military chain of command **[[poses an
even larger risk]{.underline}]{.mark}** and a legal challenge of
ensuring law compliance in host allied nations.

The voluntary use of civilians to support an armed defense of a state or
the spontaneous appearance and/or encouragement of civilian resistance
(a sort of modern levée en masse) likewise raises legal issues. The
civilian support can constitute acts harmful to the adversary and, thus,
constitute taking direct part in hostilities that lead to loss of
civilian protection. If this is not the case, civilians supporting armed
forces may [risk being part of lawful collateral damage.]{.underline}
Overall, the [[civilian population]{.underline}]{.mark} as such [may be
[endangered]{.mark}]{.underline} as the vital distinction between
civilians and armed resistance (NIAC) or civilians and combatants (IAC)
will be blurred. Moreover, the population in Estonia and Lithuania may
refer to their constitutional duty and right to defend their state
independence and country against armed attack and invasion, as either a
last resort (\"\[i\]f no other means are available\") 173or an
unconditioned duty and right. 174

This \"duty\" and/or \"right\" to conduct civilian resistance depends on
the means available such as weapons (also improvised), ammunition,
cyber/media capabilities among the civilian population, and the
lawfulness of such acts by \" levée en masse\" movements under the LOAC,
which will not be further analyzed here.

d\. Specific Legal Challenges by countering Informational Campaign and
Psychological Operations

A hybrid information campaign, psychological operation, or any other
hostile informational activity regarding fake news will not reach the
threshold of an armed conflict in the sense of an armed attack or
equivalent acts of aggression, but may still constitute an unlawful
threat of attack or other unlawful acts under international law such as
interfering in the internal affairs of other states. If the hybrid
information campaign includes encouragements of the commission of acts
contrary to general principles of humanitarian law and illegal advice in
a distributed manual on psychological operations this would constitute a
violation of LOAC, including the Common Article 3 of the GCs in a NIAC.
175In addition, national law usually limits, prohibits or even
criminalizes certain forms of propaganda for unrest, riots, terror or
other acts of hostilities and war. 176

The means and methods to counter hybrid information campaigns and
psychological operations in peacetime and crisis are limited firstly by
SOFA restrictions such as the general prohibition under the NATO SOFA to
engage in any \"political activity\" in the receiving state, secondly by
HRL restraints, and most importantly, thirdly by the limited extent of
suitable and capable law enforcement measures applicable in peacetime
and crisis. For the most part, counter information measures will have to
be strictly based on facts and truth and will, thus, come too late to
prevent the effect of the hybrid campaign - the countermeasures will
only mitigate the damages. The effective measure against a hybrid
information campaign is a rule of law-based counter and preemptive
information about an existing hybrid threat and warfare, knowledge of
which can build civilian, political and legal resilience.

VI\. CONCLUSION AND THE WAY FORWARD: BUILDING LEGAL RESILIENCE IN JUS
ANTE BELLUM

A defense alliance can undertake various tasks, and the core tasks for
NATO are three: cooperative security, crisis management under Article
3-4 of the NATO treaty, and collective defense under Article 5 of the
NATO treaty. The raison d\'être of NATO is maintaining member state\'s
commitment and support, where legal legitimacy, adherence to legal
values, and member states \"rule of law\" policies are essential parts.

The legal interoperability and legal resilience are, however, decisively
challenged by a hybrid threat and warfare mostly conducted just below,
or in the \"gray-zone\" of the threshold for armed conflict and, thus,
apparently in a peacetime or crisis legal setting. Here, the framework
for a response by individual states and NATO, as such, is to some degree
uncertain, different from nation to nation and imposing legal
constraints, making it difficult and complex to respond effectively.
These legal challenges and \"gaps\" within the jus ante bellum and
additional gray-zones in the jus ad bellum and jus in bello - some of
which are analyzed above - will have to be considered more thoroughly by
defense alliances, such as NATO, and its member states with the purpose
of building and increasing legal resilience. 177

On the one hand, the legal framework of the jus in bello applicable in
case of an armed conflict and the activation of individual and
collective self-defense according to Article 5 of the NATO Treaty is
well-codified at the international level and/or supplemented by
customary international law, although a number of key issues remain
unregulated and/or disputed. The critical issue is not the content of
the law governing the conduct of hostilities but rather the conditions
for the applicability of the jus in bello. This grayzone area of the
threshold for a NIAC (organization, intensity and territorial control)
and an IAC (attribution of hostile activities to states in terms of
\"effective control\" or \"overall control\") gives ample options for
the conduct of hybrid campaigns.

On the other hand, the jus ad bellum is covered by several gray zones
and uncertainties, which in a hybrid threat and warfare setting create
significant legal \"gaps\" to be exploited by, in particular,
non-law-abiding states and non-state actors. The unclear and disputed
\"gravity\" requirement and the unsettled issue of a possible use of
force under the disguise of a \"humanitarian intervention\" are symbolic
in this regard.

Apparently, the case law of the ICJ is based on a ratio of restricting
the right to use force (the jus ad bellum regime) by setting a gravity
requirement for the jus ad bellum, a formalistic approach to (collective
self-defense) and a highly effective control test for state attribution,
which all seem out of tune with the realities of hybrid threats and
warfare. Such a restrictive and formalistic view of international law
may turn out to achieve the exact opposite; it opens several windows of
opportunity for an asymmetric hybrid warfare below the critical
threshold for the right to war ( jus ad bellum) and narrows down the
possibility to create effective deterrence policies and apply effective
countermeasures.

Most importantly, the legal regime applicable before a situation of
state self-defense and an armed conflict is, to a large extent, national
and not international and uniform. Thus, the content of jus ante bellum
applicable in each state differs significantly and is only in some
areas, such as HRL, aligned. The supporting treaty framework for NATO
operations mainly focuses on whether and on what conditions foreign
forces, Headquarters, and NATO as an organization, national
representatives to NATO and international staff to NATO can be present
in alliance or partner states (questions of entry, status and
jurisdiction). However, these agreements and [**[bilateral SOFAs do not
address how]{.mark} and to what extent [foreign forces can]{.mark} act,
[use force, support security]{.mark}** and crisis management under
Articles 3-4 of the NATO treaty and be used in supporting law
enforcement in a state of emergency or martial law. This is a decisive
regulative and an alignment \"gap\" in the existing the SOFA
regime.]{.underline} The national emergency (martial) law and the
applicable HRL with possible national derogations in times of crisis
provoked by a hybrid warfare differ decisively, which reduces the
important legal resilience in [jus ante bellum.]{.underline}

[The possible way forward is to build more legal resilience in the jus
ante bellum and align the current views and interpretations of
international law]{.underline}, including the jus ad bellum, jus in
bello and jus post bellum in order to meet the legal challenges of
hybrid threats and warfare. [[If]{.underline}]{.mark} a defense
alliance, such as [[NATO, wants to effectively counter]{.mark} the
ongoing and future [hybrid]{.mark} threats and [war]{.mark}fare, the
aspects of [legal resilience]{.mark} and robustness [must be]{.mark} an
[integrated]{.mark} part.]{.underline} Therefore, it is recommended that
a NATO Center of Excellence on Legal Resilience (Legal Resilience CoE)
is set up with this main task. Research should inter alia be conducted
on: (i) the various gray zones and \"gaps\" in international law, the
LOAC and HRL; (ii) the different national peacetime and emergency
regulations and how these could be improved, aligned and model laws
drafted; and (iii) a possible reform of existing SOFAs by drafting new
model SOFAs, which address the significant \"gaps\" in the current SOFA
regulation.

#### US leadership over PMC regulation encourages international follow-on

Michael **Scheimer 9**, 2009, "Separating Private Military Companies
From Illegal Mercenaries in International Law: Proposing an
International Convention for Legitimate Military and Security Support
the Reflects Customary International Law", American University
International Law Review, Article 6, Vol. 24, Issue 3,

2\. The Convention Should Specifically Require PMCs to Adhere to the
Laws of War The convention should explicitly require PMCs to adhere to
the rules of the laws of war, humanitarian law, and international
criminal law.151 Furthermore, the convention should require that PMCs
only work for recognized governments or internationally accepted
movements for self determination.152 Only association with a state or
emerging state through contract marks a PMC as a legitimate actor.153 A
PMC that fails to obey the provisions of the convention should lose its
approved PMC operator license. 3. **[The PMC Convention Should [Require
Registration and Licensing for PMCs to Establish
Legitimacy]{.mark}]{.underline}** The licensing process should clearly
distinguish the legitimate PMC from the lone mercenary in the eyes of
the international community, by vetting the backgrounds of the PMC's
employees.154 The international community should shun any PMC that does
not go through the licensing process,155 [although some
[countries]{.mark} may chose to ignore]{.underline} the
[requirements]{.underline} of international registration and hire non-
accredited PMCs at their peril.156 But those [states [run the risk of
becoming tainted by the **actions of PMCs**]{.mark} on their behalf
[that]{.mark} may **[reflect poorly on the state]{.mark}.**157 It is
also in a PMC's interest to become internationally licensed so the PMC
may present the license as a clear, international approval of the
PMC]{.underline}, distinguishing it from the illegal operator.158
Furthermore, if PMCs choose not to seek a license, the stigma of
[[being]{.mark} an [unaccredited]{.mark} PMC [could have an impact on
their global business]{.mark}]{.underline}.159 [[It is also in the
interest of the PMCs]{.mark} themselves [to have a uniform,
international standard rather than risk]{.mark} the [uneven application
of laws to]{.mark} their [employees in different
countries]{.mark}.]{.underline}160 4. The U.S. Must Champion the
Initiative to Draft a PMC Convention The absence of U.S. support for the
1977 and 1989 definitions of mercenaries has only weakened the impact of
the resulting international conventions.161 Since the flood of private
military firms is a result of the build up of Cold War forces, and the
consequent draw down of military forces during the 1990s, it is vital
that the United States, its allies, and the former Soviet Bloc states
take the forefront of revising international law.162 The [[U.S. failure
to **implement a strict domestic licensing and oversight**]{.mark}
regime regulating the PMCs accompanying military forces [weakens the
effect of]{.mark} any [U.S. law.]{.mark}]{.underline}163 In particular,
[[the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [should take the
lead]{.mark} in an international solution [because of the]{.mark} highly
visible [problems in Iraq with private military firms]{.mark} that are
[working for U.S. government agencies]{.mark}.]{.underline}164
Furthermore, **[the [support of major state powers like the]{.mark}
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates and its allies [will ensure the new
convention is speedily implemented]{.mark},]{.underline}** and does not
sit idle for decades like the U.N. Convention.165

#### Russian PMC's cause World War Three

Steve **Bird 19** - Senior Reporter at TELEGRAPH MEDIA GROUP. ("Rash
Russia could start world war, says defence chief," the Sunday Telegraph,
09/10/2019, accessed thru Lexis ) PJW

[[RUSSIA\'S]{.mark} imprudent behaviour and [lack of respect for
**i**]{.mark}]{.underline}nternational [[**law** risk]{.mark} an
\"**inadvertent [miscalc]{.mark}ulation**\" that [could **escalate into
world war**]{.mark}]{.underline}, the Chief of Defence Staff warns
today.

Drawing comparisons with the series of catastrophic events in 1914 that
triggered the First World War, General Sir Nick Carter writes in an
article for The Sunday Telegraph that [peace is under threat from
\"new]{.underline} types\" of \"alternative [weapons\" that no longer
need to \"go bang\" to destabilise international security.]{.underline}

In a Remembrance Sunday message, he highlights how [a \"[grey
zone]{.mark}\" has [emerged where]{.mark}]{.underline} new techniques,
including cyber attacks, assassination, fake news, corrupt business
practices [and the use of **[private security companies, are creating a
world \"less stable than]{.mark} at [any time since World War
Two]{.mark}\".**]{.underline}

After outlining how Russia has been accused of testing \"disinformation
tactics\" through Facebook, Sir Nick writes: \"I am not suggesting that
our opponents want to go to war in the traditional definition of the
term, but [**[reckless behaviour]{.mark}** and the lack of respect for
i]{.underline}nternational [law]{.underline} relating to these new types
of \'weapons\', [**[risks escalation]{.mark}** that could easily lead to
inadvertent miscalculation.]{.underline}

\"The July crisis of [1914]{.underline} instigated by the assassination
of Archduke Ferdinand [escalated into war as a result of]{.underline} a
complex web of alliances and a series of [miscalculations by European
leaders.\"]{.underline}

Sir Nick, 60, also [calls for a \"[global response to modernise and
protect]{.mark}\" the multilateral [alliances]{.mark} that have [secured
stability]{.mark} since 1945.]{.underline}

He explains how \"[ambitious\" foreign powers, including Russia, China
and Iran, are trying to assert themselves both regionally and
globally.]{.underline}

Meanwhile, terrorist organisations such as Isil are determined to
undermine Western democracies, a threat \"complicated by mass migration
and compounded by populism\", he claims.

Companies: 'Chinese Muscle' And Reasons For US Engagement -- Analysis,"
Eurasia Review, 07/07/2020,

) PJW

On 7 February 2019, General Thomas Waldhauser, then-Commander of United
States Africa Command, stated the following during a hearing of the U.S.
Senate Armed Services Committee: \"The Chinese bring the money and the
Russians bring the muscle.\"1 \"Chinese money\" is evident in the fact
that since 2009, China has been Africa\'s largest trading partner.
Building upon this robust relationship, President Xi Jinping announced
in September 2018, that USD 60 billion in assistance, loans, and
investments would be forthcoming to African recipients.2 \"Russian
muscle\" in Africa is increasingly evident through Moscow\'s reliance
upon private military and security companies (PMSCs)---such as the
Wagner Group--- to do its bidding in countries like Libya, Sudan, and
Central African Republic.

This article does not dispute the Commander\'s wide-ranging assertions
about the United States\' two appointed great power rivals, but it does
contend that [U.S. policymakers should]{.underline} also [consider
Chinese PMSCs, the \"Chinese muscle\"]{.underline} often [found
alongside \"Chinese money.\"]{.underline} Moreover, one should
contemplate the Chinese PMSC presence beyond Africa. [As China develops
a global footprint]{.underline}, for example through geoeconomic and
geostrategic efforts such as the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), [its
dependence upon PMSCs too will expand.]{.underline}

To make its case, this article has two parts. First, it presents the
rationale for why **[[China is]{.mark} increasingly [relying]{.mark}
up[on PM]{.mark}S[Cs]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The article identifies the
growing vulnerabilities that have accompanied China\'s advancing global
presence and the merits of a Chinese PMSC solution. Second, [the article
suggests the need for U.S. engagement vis-à-vis the Chinese PMSC
issue]{.underline} despite its potential implications for China\'s
expansionism. Indeed, the [BRI, Chinese interactions with Africa, and
Beijing\'s endeavors elsewhere will continue, thus maintaining its
reliance on PMSCs.]{.underline} Additionally, the [Chinese PMSC
industry]{.underline} is in the midst of flux. Its eventual [orientation
is a matter of concern given that the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [has been the **global champion of a defensively
oriented and transparent PMSC industry**. The U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates assuredly [wishes to dissuade China from following
the assertive, offensive, and deniable route taken by Russia and its
reliance upon firms.]{.underline} As such, the article contends that
[[U.S]{.mark}. policymakers [should]{.mark} strive]{.underline}, with
some sensitivity, [to **[bring China]{.mark} and its
[PM]{.mark}S[Cs]{.mark} more [into the regulatory
fold]{.mark}**]{.underline} developed over the past 20 years.

Chinese Global Expansion and Security Privatization

While China has engaged in development assistance, resource extraction
activities, and infrastructure projects with African partners since the
1990s, the BRI is of a newer vintage and on a transcontinental scale.
Announced by President Xi in 2013, China is working in more than 80
countries in Central, South, and Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and
the Horn of Africa to construct energy, land and maritime
transportation, and communications networks with and through them,
ending at the European Union. At its planned fruition, the BRI will
connect 70 percent of the earth\'s population and be linked to countries
generating 55 percent of the world\'s gross domestic product, and
locales of 75 percent of global energy reserves.3 With the level of
investment reaching perhaps as high as USD 4 trillion, the BRI is
nothing less than \"a Marshall Plan with Chinese characteristics.\"4

Taking the mature China-Africa relationship and the upstart BRI
together, Chinese interests are now considerably exposed to security
upheaval well beyond China\'s borders. Wang Duanyong and Zhao Pei
categorize these overseas challenges as \"extraneous risks\" and
\"endogenous risks.\"5 Extraneous risks are those that Chinese actors
confront in the often weak state, conflicted environments in which they
invest, extract, and work. [Criminality, **extremism,
[terrorism]{.mark}**, ethnic strife, and separatism]{.underline}
frequently [blight the countries in which China pursues its
interests.]{.underline} Moreover, [non-state actors may [target]{.mark}
the [Chinese presence because of]{.mark} its [perceived assistance to
host government]{.mark} authorities.]{.underline} For example, in recent
years, [Chinese interests have been so targeted in South Sudan and
Pakistan.]{.underline}

In contrast, endogenous risks are those of Chinese origin. [Anti-Chinese
sentiment may arise due to poor working conditions, the upset caused to
the local economic status quo, a disregard for environmental
degradations, a failure to engage fulsomely with local populations, and
cultural insensitivity.]{.underline}6 In some instances, resentment can
surface because the hiring of locals is in fact limited given a Chinese
penchant for \"whole chain industry export.\"7 Extraneous and endogenous
[[risks can combine when]{.mark} the [Chinese]{.mark} presence [becomes
embroiled in a host country\'s politic]{.mark}al dynamic[s]{.mark}. In
Kenya, Zambia, South Sudan, the Maldives, Malaysia, and
elsewhere,]{.underline} governing and opposition
[politicians]{.underline} in the midst of their politicking have
[decried the Chinese presence and]{.underline} the
[corruption]{.underline} that has allegedly occurred, [[leading to
increased]{.mark} antipathy and heightened
[tensions]{.mark}.]{.underline}8

[[Though Beijing would like to rely]{.mark} up[on local forces to
provide security, host government]{.mark} authoritie[s may be unable or
unwilling]{.mark} to provide Chinese workers and businesses with
adequate protection.]{.underline} The very [weakness of many states in
which China invests means that military and police bodies are often
underpaid, [overstretched, poorly trained]{.mark}, and riven by the same
tensions affecting the state writ large.]{.underline} For instance,
Chinese personnel working in the Democratic Republic of Congo report of
routinely being subject to \"legitimate harm\" at the hands of soldiers
and police officers.9 In Iraq, [one Chinese business called upon the
local police in response to looting only to see the responding officers
join in the fray.]{.underline}10

[Private security contractor DeWei Group has more than 8,000 employees
operating in 37 countries.]{.underline} (Handout)

The dangers Chinese citizens and operations confront overseas and the
varying responses of local forces have caught the attention of Chinese
officialdom. In 2012, thePeople\'s Daily, the official newspaper of the
Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, printed the
following: \"China should deeply study the diplomatic protection
issue... China should also discuss how China strengthens its diplomatic
influence... so that China can safeguard its national interests and
protect its citizens to the maximum extent.\"11In terms of hard
measures, note now the training offered by Chinese peacekeepers and
other military personnel. Consider also that China is presently the
second largest arms exporter to Africa. In terms of soft measures, the
Chinese leadership hopes that economic improvements catalyzed by Chinese
engagement will improve security outcomes overall. In 2014, President Xi
promoted sustainable development as the way forward for security: \"We
need to focus on development, actively improve people\'s lives and
narrow down the wealth gap so as to cement the foundation of
security.\"12Nevertheless, only certain weapons are appropriate for
protecting Chinese workers and worksites, embedding the lessons from
training takes time, and reforming political, economic, and cultural
issues takes even longer.

[Yet [reliance]{.mark}]{.underline} instead [up[on]{.mark}
the]{.underline} People\'s Liberation Army ([**[PLA]{.mark}**) in a
consistent and substantial way **[is also
problematic]{.mark}**.]{.underline} As the RAND Corporation\'s Timothy
Heath identifies, [the overseas protection of China\'s rights and
interests is not]{.underline} fundamentally [conceived as a military
problem.]{.underline} True, Heath does recognize a [Chinese [capability
to transport]{.mark} and operate military [forces abroad]{.mark}, but
this [is]{.mark} a]{.underline} nascent and [[limited]{.mark}
capability.]{.underline}13 Moreover, [other obstacles confronting
greater PLA engagement include]{.underline} the following: complications
concerning [China\'s official non-interference policy; the symbolism of
a PLA presence on land; potential concerns of escalation and a related
tentativeness due to a lack of combat experience]{.underline}; the
financial implications of funding such operations; [and concerns that a
robust [PLA presence]{.mark} could unduly [confound]{.mark} Beijing\'s
regional [diplomatic relations]{.mark}hips]{.underline}.14 [One former
PLA officer captures the limitations thus:]{.underline} \"The need for
security protection overseas is quite significant and [the army
is]{.underline} clearly [not suitable for this job due to the potential
problems it might cause for foreign relations.\"]{.underline}15

[With the security demand not readily satisfied, the regulatory and
political milieus have become increasingly supportive of a Chinese PMSC
presence overseas.]{.underline} On 28 September 2009, the Executive
Meeting of the State Council adopted the \"Regulation on the
Administration of Security and Guarding Services\" which came into force
1 January 2010. This regulation provides some guidance on the
requirements for registration and operations domestically and abroad.
Lest there be concerns that Chinese PMSCs might work against the state,
Article 78 of China\'s 2015 National Security Law draws all non-state
actors to the cause of China\'s national security: \"State organs, mass
organizations, enterprises, public institutions, and other social
organizations shall cooperate with relevant departments in employing
relevant security measures as required by national security efforts.\"16
Finally, top level sanction came in the wake of attacks against the
Chinese presence in South Sudan in 2016. President [[Xi
embraced]{.underline}]{.mark} the sorts of activities performed by
[[PM]{.mark}S[Cs]{.mark} by identifying a requirement for \"improved
safety risk evaluation, monitoring and pre-warning, and the handling of
emergencies.\"]{.underline}17

[The result has been a burgeoning private security
industry.]{.underline} Domestically, 2017 statistics reveal an industry
5,800 firms strong that employs approximately five million personnel.18
China\'s domestic private security industry is now one of the largest in
the world with a growth rate of approximately 20 percent annually.19

Internationally, [the Chinese PMSC footprint]{.underline}, while smaller
than some others, [is growing in size]{.underline} and importance.
Consider these examples. Dewei Security Group Limited protects both the
China Road and Bridge Corporation\'s efforts to construct the
Nairobi-Mombasa railway and the China National Petroleum Corporation\'s
work in Sudan and South Sudan. It also provides security services to
Chinese Poly-GCL Petroleum Group Holdings\' Liquefied Natural Gas
undertakings in Ethiopia. Huaxin China Security performs counter-piracy
work on Chinese flagged ships operating off the Horn of Africa and in
Southeast Asian waters. Guanan Security & Technology guards ZhenHua
Oil\'s activities in Iraq. Other firms are active in Afghanistan,
Cambodia, Iraq, Libya, Malaysia, Mongolia, Mozambique, Pakistan,
Thailand, Turkey, and elsewhere working mostly for state-owned
enterprises (SOEs). In total, approximately 30 Chinese firms offer their
services overseas.20

Several factors capture the appeal of utilizing Chinese PMSCs
specifically. Given the largely Chinese clientele, Chinese PMSCs can
offer a common working language and respect cultural affinities.21 As
one Dewei official put it, \"For Chinese firms, especially with security
work, they... want to speak with another Chinese person. We can also one
hundred percent reflect their thinking when we work.\"22 Another factor
is cost. [Whereas foreign PMSCs often have more experience, it comes at
a cost Chinese clients are unwilling to bear.]{.underline} Some
calculations suggest that 12 Chinese guards equate to the cost of one
U.S. or British guard.23 Lastly, and related to this, Chinese personnel
are preferred over foreigners given sensitivity to protecting the
confidential information of SOEs. Chinese PMSC personnel with former
military, police, or government experience seemingly pass an implicit
higher loyalty test.24 Therefore, it is not surprising that many Chinese
PMSCs working abroad have their Beijing offices near SOE headquarters
and the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs.25

Looking to the future, opportunities seemingly abound for Chinese PMSCs.
A managing director of the Chinese Overseas Security Group assessed in
2017 that \"In eight years\' time, we want to run a business that can
cover 50--60 countries, which fits with the One Belt One Road
coverage.\"26 Given that 2016 assessments found that [Chinese PMSC
personnel working abroad outnumbered PLA personnel on
U]{.underline}nited [N]{.underline}ations [duty]{.underline}---3,200 to
2,600---**[Chinese [PM]{.mark}S[Cs are an important element of China\'s
international posture]{.mark}.]{.underline}**27 In fact, for one
industry watcher, [China\'s swelling global presence and the
quantitative expansion of Chinese PMSCs operating internationally taken
together mean that the role Chinese firms play in \"the security arena
is going to [affect]{.mark} not only the security actors but also [the
security stage as a whole]{.mark}.\"]{.underline}28

U.S. Engagement: Reasons and Response

On the one hand, the [Chinese presence in Africa and a successful
implementation of the [BRI inherently challenge U.S.
interests]{.mark}]{.underline} and standing in many parts of the world.
Though the [[U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates
has implemented [[countering initiatives]{.mark} such as the Build
Act]{.underline}, they [[do not match the scale]{.mark} of Chinese
financing and infrastructure efforts.]{.underline}29 [These activities
will]{.underline} likely [open up new markets that will help China and
others to wean themselves from their reliance on the U.S. market and the
U.S. dollar.]{.underline}30 Coupled with its material gains, [[China\'s
endeavors will]{.mark} ideationally **[advance authoritarian]{.mark}
capital[ism]{.mark}**, rather than free market capitalism]{.underline}
championed by the United States, [as a way of doing business
globally.]{.underline} Absolutely and relatively to the United States,
[China will garner more sway abroad]{.underline} either [through
its]{.underline} welcomed [largesse or through foreign governments now
being economically indebted to Beijing.]{.underline}31In short, these
developments easily fall into the 2017 National Security Strategy\'s
worries that [China wants \"[to **shape a world antithetical to
U.S**]{.mark}**. values and [interests]{.mark}**.\"]{.underline}32

On the other hand, U.S. policymakers might also benefit from a degree of
perspective---the BRI\'s fulsome success is no sure thing and Beijing
has already encountered challenges in Africa. True, speaking about the
BRI specifically in May 2017, President Xi asserted that the initiative
\"should focus on the fundamental issue of development, release the
growth potential of various countries and achieve economic integration
and interconnected development and deliver benefits to all.\"33The
Chinese narrative for the BRI and elsewhere is that China works to
develop \"win-win\" relationships. Nevertheless, according to one China
observer, \"win-win cooperation is perceived as
[[\'China]{.underline}]{.mark} is going to win twice.\'\"34As indicated
earlier, such a dynamic [[increases]{.mark} political [tensions]{.mark}
among the governments, political parties, and populations of target
countries.]{.underline}

[Regarding China\'s]{.underline} specific [reliance upon
PMSCs]{.underline} in this milieu, this author\'s contention is that
[the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [should not look
away.]{.underline} This is counterintuitive because, at first glance,
[the above might suggest that the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [should not concern itself.]{.underline} From one
angle, China\'s usage of PMSCs may help to make secure various Chinese
economic and political initiatives that will negatively affect the
United States in a zero-sum fashion. Why should the United States help
this relationship to flourish? From another angle, [China faces
considerable problems abroad and Beijing\'s usage of PMSCs
speaks]{.underline}, in part, [to this generated
resistance.]{.underline} Why should U.S. policymakers expend limited
diplomatic resources to ameliorate China\'s sometimes fraught
relationships?

To contextualize the reasons for a U.S. response, one should recognize
that **[[the U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [**[is the global champion of]{.mark}
a [defensive]{.mark}ly oriented [and transparent PM]{.mark}S[C]{.mark}
industry**.]{.underline} This was made plain during the military
[activities in Afghanistan, Iraq, and elsewhere]{.underline} in this
century that [set the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [as the
world\'s largest consumer of PMSC services.]{.underline} Certainly, U.S.
officials have not denied their reliance upon PMSCs. If anything,
government officials promote contractors writ large as part of the
\"Total Force Concept.\" [As a regulator it is important to note the
U.S. **[D]{.mark}**]{.underline}epartment **[[o]{.underline}]{.mark}**f
**[[D]{.underline}]{.mark}**efense[\'s 2012 decision to]{.underline}
contract ASIS International and the American National Standards
Institute to [create the PSC.1 [Standard]{.mark}. This standard
buttresses the industry\'s defensive credentials that U.S. hiring
decisions in turn reinforce.]{.underline} Moreover, [**[other states now
use]{.mark} the standard** in their PMSC procurement
efforts.]{.underline}35

[One can also applaud the [U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [as a **[set]{.mark}ter of [international
norms]{.mark}** for a variety of actors. The U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [is an initial signatory to the 2008 Montreux
Document on PMSCs.]{.underline}36In the Document, \"Military and
security services include, in particular,armed guarding and protection
of persons and objects, such as convoys, buildings and other places;
maintenance and operation of weapons systems; prisoner detention; and
advice to or training of local forces and security personnel\" (italics
added).37The document also recommends various procedures that publicly
set relationships between states and firms. This document has 56 state
signatories as of June 2019.

[Building on this, the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, along
with only six other countries, [is a member of the International Code of
Conduct Association (ICoCA). This association concerns]{.underline}, in
many ways, [Montreux Document-related matters. This is through its
advancement of the 2010 International Code of Conduct for Private
Security Service Providers (ICoC]{.underline}), the industry\'s response
to the Montreux Document. Like the Montreux Document, [the ICoC has a
defensive focus: firms are not to \"use firearms against persons except
in self-defence or defence of others against the imminent threat of
death or serious injury, or to prevent the perpetration of a
particularly serious crime involving grave threat to
life]{.underline}.\"38

In addition, predating the Montreux Document, [the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [has been attentive to PMSC usage by non-state
actors such as resource extraction companies.]{.underline} For instance,
[the 2000 Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights is a
multi-stakeholder initiative involving states and non-governmental
organizations, oil, gas, and mining companies that espouses a defensive
focus:]{.underline} \"Consistent with their function, private security
should provide only preventative and defensive services and should not
engage in activities exclusively the responsibility of state military or
law enforcement authorities.\"39In short, [PMSCs are not to use
offensive violence on behalf of their commercial clients.]{.underline}

It follows that there are three reasons why the United States should
engage on the Chinese PMSC issue. First, Chinese economic and political
dynamics that are not going to disappear drive China\'s reliance on
PMSCs. Chinese economic growth, a key element for domestic calm, has
slowed, catalyzing Beijing to look to Africa and Asia particularly in
order to export its excess capacity and to find new markets for consumer
goods.40 The fact that President Xi, unburdened by term limits since
2018, has linked himself closely to the BRI further extends the horizon.
Indeed, Beijing has invested so much in the [BRI]{.underline} that, for
one Chinese analyst, it [is \"the essence of the realisation of the
Chinese dream]{.underline} and the rejuvenation of our nation... [It is
the framework for foreign policy in the decades to
come]{.underline}.\"41Overall, China\'s international outreach towards
multiple continents, and the associated PMSC usage, will continue.

The second reason for U.S. engagement is that [in the midst of China\'s
continued reliance, **[there is]{.mark} great [potential for change in
the orientation of Chinese PM]{.mark}S[Cs]{.mark}.**]{.underline} To
explain, [most Chinese PMSCs presently lack substantial capabilities to
inflict lethal violence. Though the aforementioned 2010 regulation
loosened restrictions on China\'s private security industry, rules
remain in place regarding firearm possession.]{.underline} With the
exception of firms conducting counter-piracy work at sea, the government
does not permit Chinese PMSCs to use firearms abroad. Instead, Chinese
PMSCs have focused on security within compounds and have generally
relied upon non-lethal weaponry, martial arts, negotiation skills, local
intelligence collection, and crisis management and evacuation
procedures. In challenging environments, Chinese PMSCs are to rely
either upon locally contracted security firms who can carry arms or upon
Chinese embassy and consular officials for assistance.

[This approach has its limits and there is evidence of some
workarounds]{.underline} given the dangers involved. [Non-lethal
measures may not provide the necessary deterrence. Local private
security may not have the requisite capabilities, skillsets, or
professionalism. Chinese government officials are often at great
distance from the threatened worksite]{.underline} or living quarters
[and they have to count on their relationships with a]{.underline}
sometimes [shaky host security sector]{.underline} described above. As
such, media [reports indicate a persistent dilemma that confronts PMSCs:
stay unarmed or delve into the local black market for
weaponry.]{.underline}42 [Others indicate that firms have borrowed
firearms from the local security firms.]{.underline}43 Underscoring the
need to arm their personnel, some firms have made arrangements abroad
for firearms training.44

Additional [change]{.underline}, going [beyond a]{.underline} more
robust [defensive posture through firearms usage, might
arrive]{.underline} through Chinese concepts and an experiential record
concerning non-state actors that could frame an offensive use of PMSCs.
Conceptually, since 2003, [the Communist Party and China\'s Central
Military Commission]{.underline} have [embraced the so-called \"Three
Warfares\" concept.]{.underline} While one can find an in-depth
consideration of this approach elsewhere, it is important to stress for
this article that it [places less emphasis on violence delivered by
state armed forces]{.underline}.45 [Instead, \"Three Warfares\" pays
greater attention to]{.underline} a wider variety of tools, including
state and [non-state actors, which are neither as costly nor imbued with
the same degree of symbolism.]{.underline} As Laura Jackson suggests,
this stance is \"a significant shift away from current understandings of
war as defined primarily by the kinetic and tangible, and towards one
focused more on thought processes, mental impressions, and the will to
act.\"46 Yet [the concept\'s tools can be coercive]{.underline} in their
own way [and are the means to achieve strategic objectives.]{.underline}
To explain further, [these tools]{.underline}, used alone or in
combination, [are not as likely to spark a]{.underline} considerable
[response from adversaries]{.underline} prohibiting China\'s task
achievement. In fact, [their [**usage may be ambiguous**,
thus]{.mark}]{.underline} further [[hindering]{.mark} the
[reactions]{.mark} of others.]{.underline} Moreover, [utilization of the
\"Three Warfares\" is constant, thus **[blurring the boundaries between
war and peace]{.mark}.**]{.underline} As asserted by Elsa Kania: \"the
application of the three warfares is intended to control the prevailing
discourse and influence perceptions in a way that advances China\'s
interests, while compromising the capability of opponents to
respond.\"47

The realization of this concept is evident through Chinese practices at
the country\'s peripheries. As Lora Saalman contends, China relies upon
\"\'little green men\' (nomads and paramilitaries at land borders) and
\'little blue men\' (fishermen and coastguard vessels at maritime
borders)\" to expand its influence.48 [Reliance on these actors keeps
the Chinese military in the background while the status quo is
nevertheless upended in China\'s favor]{.underline} by means of
incremental moves, coercion, and ambiguity. James Kraska asserts that
[such an approach]{.underline} augments \"operational, legal and
political challenges for any opponent \... \[it\] [complicates the
battlespace, [degrades]{.mark} any [opponent]{.mark}\'s
[decision-making]{.mark} process and exposes adversaries [to]{.mark}
political dilemmas that will [make them more cautious]{.mark} to act
against China.]{.underline}\"49

Though China uses [this approach]{.underline} in areas of proximity to
the mainland, one can argue that it [might be employed further
away]{.underline}. Indeed, [China\'s approach towards the
S]{.underline}outh [C]{.underline}hina [S]{.underline}ea
[is]{.underline} arguably [a testing ground for future
activism.]{.underline}50In this vein, [the successful spread of the
[BRI]{.mark} might [recast what is deemed as China\'s
periphery,]{.mark}]{.underline} at least in a strategic sense.

In sum, one should not shy away from considering the future trajectory
of [Chinese PMSCs]{.underline} given these ideas and evolving practices.
Without a doubt, they would [stand contrary to]{.underline} the U.S.
experience and [how the U.S. approach has framed the defensive and
predictable character of the international PMSC industry.]{.underline}

The third reason for [U.S. engagement]{.underline} is to [dissuade China
from mimicking the route taken by Russia in its usage of
PMSCs.]{.underline} Not only has Russia relied upon companies in a
generally offensive manner, as a non-signatory to the Voluntary
Principles on Security and Human Rights, it has advocated a particularly
aggressive posture vis-à-vis resource producing areas. For instance, a
Syrian-Russian agreement permits Russian extractive companies to accrue
25 percent of the proceeds produced from regions external to Damascus\'
control. To capture these regions, PMSC reliance is required. On the one
hand, Moscow has put this development in the context of countering
international terrorism. President Putin commented that \"members of
these firms are risking their lives in the fight against terrorism by
retaking oil wells and infrastructure that had been controlled by the
Islamic State.\"51On the other hand, one should recall the February 2018
clash in Syria between U.S. forces and the Russian firm Wagner. This is
because near the battle site was the Coneco oil processing facility
under non-ISIS and non-regime control.52 [Due to the aggressive bent
of]{.underline} some [Chinese non-state actors, the resource-centric
elements of China\'s relationship with Africa and the BRI, and the fact
that China]{.underline} also [is not a signatory to the Voluntary
Principles on Security and Human Rights, one could envision a more
provocative and assertive China following a similar path.]{.underline}

Furthermore, there are potential similarities between Russia and China
regarding transparency. For Russia, a non-signatory to the Montreux
Document, despite high-level recognition that firms like Wagner are
working abroad, Moscow denies official control and responsibility.
Again, to quote President Putin, companies \"are indeed present there
\[Syria\]... However, they are related to neither the Russian
government, nor the Armed Forces; therefore, we have no
comment.\"53Nevertheless, according to analyst Mark Galeotti,
connections with the state are plain: firms are \"\'hybrid businesses,\'
technically private, but essentially acting as the arms of the Russian
state.\"54 [For China, PMSC usage is a]{.underline} prospective [tool to
avoid negative outcomes that might be associated with a PLA mission
abroad and an official disruption of the aforementioned non-interference
policy. Because former members of China\'s state security sector
populate firms, they are]{.underline} possibly \"[a parallel security
strategy\" upon which the Chinese state can rely.]{.underline}55 Also,
similar to Russian firms being both celebrated and denied, analysts from
Merics and the International Institute for Strategic Studies contend
that [firms permit China \"plausible deniability in worst-case scenarios
whilst reaping the PR benefits of successful missions in the best-case
scenarios.\"]{.underline}56 For the United States then, Russian
[[deniability vis-à-vis PM]{.mark}S[Cs]{.mark} has already [proven
problematic in]{.mark} the context of **[gray zone
conflict]{.mark}**.]{.underline}57 [Diverting China from considering a
similar path would]{.underline} no doubt [be optimal from the U.S.
perspective.]{.underline}

#### China-led global order causes nuclear war 

**Hass 17**, senior fellow and the Michael H. Armacost Chair in the
Foreign Policy program at Brookings, where he holds a joint appointment
to the John L. Thornton China Center and the Center for East Asia Policy
Studies. (Ryan, 12-29-2017, \"The case for continued American leadership
in Asia\", *Brookings*,
https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/the-case-for-continued-american-leadership-in-asia/)

While I support focusing on getting our house in order at home, I fear
that [it would be **dangerously shortsighted**]{.underline} [for the
U.S. to retreat from]{.underline} its 70-plus-year status as the leading
power and agenda-setter in [the Asia-Pacific]{.underline} region.

We have to be able to walk and chew gum at the same time. Here's why:

First, [the Asia-Pacific region is **rapidly** becoming the **most
important area in the world**]{.underline} for the U.S. [It accounts for
nearly **60 percent** of **global economic growth**]{.underline}, [and
U.S. exports]{.underline} to the region [create more jobs]{.underline}
(3.4 million) [than **any other part** of the world]{.underline}. It is
home to five U.S. treaty allies, many of the world's most capable
militaries and the most proximate threat to America's national security:
North Korea's nuclear and missile programs.

[When [America]{.mark} has been **active in the region**]{.underline},
[it has [**spurred** Asian countries to]{.mark}]{.underline} share the
burden in [[respond]{.underline}]{.mark}ing [[to]{.underline}]{.mark}
humanitarian **[[disasters]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [deal]{.underline}ing
[with **[climate change]{.mark}**]{.underline},
**[increas]{.underline}**ing **[pressure]{.underline}** [on]{.underline}
**[[No]{.underline}]{.mark}**rth **[[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}**rea
[[and]{.mark} [agree]{.mark}]{.underline}ing [[on]{.mark}
**[trade]{.mark} rules** for nearly **40 percent** of the global
economy]{.underline}. At the same time, [the U.S. has **led efforts** to
push China to emerge as a **constructive**]{.underline} --- [and not a
**coercive**]{.underline} --- **[actor]{.underline}**. If the U.S.
withdraws from these roles, [there is **no other country** capable of
**pulling the region together**]{.underline} in common purpose [to
address **shared challenges**]{.underline}.

Second, [[America's]{.mark} **long** and **steady [presence]{.mark}** in
the region has helped **[deter aggression]{.mark}**]{.underline},
**[[cool]{.mark} historical [rivalries]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [[and
support]{.mark} the spread of]{.underline} market-based
**[[democracies]{.underline}]{.mark}**. While the people of the region
deserve credit, [the **U.S.-provided security umbrella**]{.underline}
also [enabled progress]{.underline}.

Up to now, [the U.S. has served as a **buffer** in regional
disputes]{.underline}, [and a **check against China** or others seeking
to use their military to **move borders** or **seize
resources**]{.underline}. [[If **confidence in U.S.
resolve**]{.underline}]{.mark} to protect the peace
**[[recedes]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [the risk of **interstate
[conflict]{.mark}** [will **rise**]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[Countries
will]{.underline}]{.mark} confront a choice between becoming more
deferential to Beijing's interests in exchange for hoped-for security
and economic benefits, or [[develop]{.underline}]{.mark}ing military
capabilities --- including **[[nuc]{.mark}lear
weapon[s]{.mark}]{.underline}** [--- to **guard against coercion** by
China or No]{.underline}rth [Ko]{.underline}rea. [If **[Japan]{.mark}**
goes nuclear, for example, **[So]{.mark}uth [Ko]{.mark}rea** [and
**Taiwan**]{.mark} could **follow**]{.underline}. [A pattern of
[**nuclear dominoes** would]{.mark} [**elevate** risk of]{.mark} a
**catastrophic [conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline} that could crater the
global economy and create unimaginable destruction.

Third, **[sustained U.S. support]{.underline}** [for **rule of law** and
**human rights** has helped generate a more **just** and **predictable
environment**]{.underline} for American businesses and travelers. For
decades, the U.S. has promoted freedoms of speech, worship and peaceful
assembly; the ability to choose leaders democratically; and the right to
due process and equal administration of justice. These efforts have
garnered goodwill for the U.S. by aligning U.S. power with aspirations
of ordinary people.

[[If the U.S. **pulls back**]{.underline}]{.mark} from promoting human
rights, [[China will]{.mark} **step up its efforts** to
**[influence]{.mark}**]{.underline} domestic
**[[politics]{.underline}]{.mark}** [throughout the region]{.underline}
--- **[pressuring politicians]{.underline}**,
**[entrapping]{.underline}** [special interests, and
**filtering**]{.underline} what **[information]{.underline}** reaches
the public. [Beijing would]{.underline} like to
**[normalize]{.underline}** [its model of privileging]{.underline}
internal [security over individual]{.underline}
**[liberties]{.underline}**. [[There]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[could
be **heightened risk** of]{.mark} **democratic
[backsliding]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [as leaders feel **less inhibited**
from resorting to **strongman governance**]{.underline}.

Fourth, [[a **diminished U.S. role** would **embolden
China**]{.underline}]{.mark} to seek to hasten the return of a
Sino-centric regional order. Broadly speaking, [Beijing would like to
**maximize its influence** and **minimize Washington's** throughout the
region]{.underline}. In instances where interests clash, such as over
trade and maritime disputes and America's alliance relationships,
Beijing would like regional governments to side with it.
[Beijing]{.underline} also [would like to **lock in trade agreements**
and **investment patterns** that place China at the **center** and the
U.S. on the **outside**]{.underline}. [This would put U.S. firms at a
**disadvantage**]{.underline}. Beijing does not seek to conquer new
territories, but rather hopes to gain regional acceptance of the notion
that China sits atop a hierarchical regional structure. Beijing views
such a distribution of power as a restoration of a natural order.

So, why does it matter if the U.S. remains the agenda-setter in the
Asia-Pacific? Because **[American leadership]{.underline}** still [holds
the **most promise of protecting the peace**]{.underline},
**[preserving]{.underline}** respect for [**rule of law** and **human
rights**]{.underline}, unlocking opportunities for American businesses,
[and increasing burden-sharing for]{.underline} dealing with
**[transnational challenges.]{.underline}** And [[if the U.S.
**withdraws**, Beijing will]{.mark} **seek to [fill the
vacuum]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[That]{.underline}]{.mark} outcome
[[would]{.mark} raise the [risk]{.mark} of **democratic
[backsliding]{.mark}**]{.underline}, **[nuclear
[prolif]{.mark}]{.underline}**eration, **[disadvantaging]{.underline}**
[U.S. companies [and]{.mark} **intensifying [great power
competition]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Given the growing importance of Asia
to America's national security and economic well-being, [this is an
outcome the U.S. can **ill-afford**]{.underline}.

Second, the distinction between an IAC and a NIAC in a hybrid warfare
setting will depend on evidence of state attribution, which will be a
difficult and highly political issue. State denial policy and covert
operations by provocateurs, Private Military Contractors
(**[[PMC]{.underline}]{.mark}**) or Private Military Security
Contractors (PMSC) like the Wagner Group, mercenaries in terms of
non-state conventional forces and state special forces (SOF) provoking
the uprising of the civilian population [[is a **central part
of**]{.mark} **the [hybrid war]{.mark}fare**.]{.underline} If one adds
to this evidential legal uncertainty, the ICJ and ICTY dispute about
whether one should apply a high degree of \"effective control\" or a
lesser degree of \"overall control,\" the legal picture of a possible
perfect hybrid scenario becomes visible. The strict
[[ICJ]{.underline}]{.mark} requirement of \"effective control\" in the
Nicaragua case seems less convincing as it legally [[allows states to
use non-state actors in the gray zone]{.underline}]{.mark} where these
strict conditions and proof thereof cannot be met. The arguments
presented by the ICTY in the Tadi? Appeal case against the view of the
ICJ seem persuasive, if alleged \"lawful\" interventions by third states
and hybrid campaigns through private non-state actors should be reduced
and prevented:

A first ground on which the Nicaragua test as such may be held to be
unconvincing is based on the very logic of the entire system of
international law on State responsibility.

The principles of international law concerning the attribution to States
of acts performed by private individuals are not based on rigid and
uniform criteria \... The rationale behind this rule is to prevent
States from escaping international responsibility by having private
individuals carry out tasks that may not or should not be performed by
State officials, or by claiming that individuals actually participating
in governmental authority are not classified as State organs under
national legislation and therefore do not engage State responsibility.
In other words, States are not allowed on the one hand to act de facto
through individuals and on the other to disassociate themselves from
such conduct when these individuals breach international law. The
requirement of international law for the attribution to States of acts
performed by private individuals is that the State exercises control
over the individuals. The degree of control may, however, vary according
to the factual circumstances of each case. The Appeals Chamber fails to
see why in each and every circumstance international law should require
a high threshold for the test of control. Rather, various situations may
be distinguished. 114

The disagreement between the ICJ and ICTY on the attribution of acts by
non-state actors to a state was reinforced by the subsequent ICJ
judgement in Genocide case 2007, where for the purpose of deciding state
responsibility, the ICJ confirmed the Nicaragua \"effective control\"
test and, moreover, expressis verbis, rejected the ICTY jurisprudence.
115With the ICJ jurisprudence, the attribution test for the purpose of
conflict classification may well be the ICTY \"overall control\" test,
which according to the ICJ could be applicable and suitable. However,
this test does not persuade for the purpose of state responsibility.
This introduces two different quality tests, which adds another legal
layer of complexity: a state can instigate an IAC by having \"overall
control\" of acts of non-state actors, but simultaneously avoid state
responsibility for the acts of those non-state actors as the \"effective
control\" test is not met. The ICJ logic of the possible application of
difference attribution tests for conflict classification and state
responsibility seems questionable and critical, at least from a hybrid
warfare perspective. Moreover, from a general perspective, it seems
unconvincing and, thus, questionable that the \"overall control\" test
is unsuitable and in the view of the ICJ stretches too far, almost to a
breaking point, the connection which must exist between the conduct of a
State\'s organs and its international responsibility. The restrictive
[perception of the ICJ on state responsibility seems [out of tune
with]{.mark} the factual [needs]{.mark} and]{.underline} the
\"[requirements]{.underline} of international life\" [[to]{.mark} be
able to legally [counter]{.mark}]{.underline} strategically willful and
unlawful [[hybrid threats]{.underline}]{.mark} and warfare.

The experience in East Ukraine speaks for itself. The threshold
(\'trigger\') for an international, armed conflict (IAC) involving more
than one state, and the threshold for state responsibility are not only
difficult to demonstrate with reliable evidence, but also covered with
legal uncertainty. In addition, there may exist a lack of appetite to
declare an IAC at the strategic political level and thereby risk an
escalation and a possible ad hoc activation of collective self-defense.

C. Specific Legal Challenges or \"Gaps\" in jus ante bellum by Hybrid
Threats and Warfare

A hybrid threat or warfare kept under the threshold of an \"armed
attack\" and below the intensity or organizational requirement for an
internal \"armed conflict\" (NIAC) will pose critical challenges to a
peacetime law enforcement regime, as it will be conducted by inter alia
indirectly employed non-state actors and covert state agents, by
provoked opposition from own and foreign citizens, by cyber-attacks, and
by the use of information campaigns utilizing fabricated or switched
fake news.

Such a hybrid threat or warfare is often coupled with a firm denial
policy of any immutability and attribution of such activities to a state
initiating and de facto controlling the hybrid campaign. The integrated
hybrid information campaign merely portrays a public picture of civilian
movements consisting of \"normal\" people being dissatisfied with the
current political regime in power and the society conditions in general.
With the legal requirement of attribution in the sense of the
\"effective control\" test or the relaxed \"overall control\" test being
disputed, and clear evidence thereof likely either ignored without legal
effect or covered by hybrid information campaign, a continued hybrid
threat and warfare with both kinetic and non-kinetic means is possible
without high, or much, political or legal risks. 116

The emerging problems with the principle of distinction just add to
this. Military clothing has become popular and trendy among civilians,
as paramilitary uniforms are seen more often in the streets. Regular
armies have been seen to disrespect traditional uniform codes and permit
self-equipment of soldiers in combat zones, missions or on exercises.
Moreover, uniforms, accessories and insignia of different states are
becoming more similar and hard to distinguish, even at a close distance.
117 The possible and recommendable remedy is, on the one hand, that
military forces consider distinction by choice of design and uniforms
and, on the other hand, that military discipline of wearing those
regular uniforms when on duty is re-enforced.

If all these circumstances come together in a law enforcement scenario
in peacetime or crisis, there will be several legal constraints and
[[restraints in]{.mark} the [jus ante bellum]{.mark}]{.underline}, which
[will [**create legal vulnerabilities** for both]{.mark} the
[victim]{.mark} state[s]{.mark}]{.underline} (host nations) [[and states
sending]{.mark} armed forces for [assistance]{.mark}, deterrence
purpose, and countermeasures.]{.underline} Some of these will be
addressed below.

a\. Limits set by the national domestic law enforcement regime and HRL

1\. Respect of Receiving State (Host Nation) Law and Political System

The deployment and presence of foreign military forces are conditioned
on the consent by the host nation as the territorial law of the host
nation decides whether foreign military units may enter the state
territory ( jus ad praesentiam) and on what conditions ( jus in
praesentia). This consent can be given ad hoc prior to each individual
deployment, or in general, as part of a defense agreement and standard
status of force agreements. The NATO SOFA applies to the \"force\" and
\"civilian component\" accompanying a force in the territory of another
NATO alliance state, whether stationed or in transit. 118 Under the NATO
SOFA and usually under any other standard or ad hoc agreed SOFA, the
foreign forces and civilian component thereof have an obligation under
treaty law \"to respect the law of the receiving state and to abstain
from any activity inconsistent with the spirit of\" the standard or ad
hoc agreed SOFA. 119 Moreover, the forces of the sending state (also
termed \"Troop-Contributing Nation,\" TCN) shall not interfere with the
internal political affairs of the receiving state and, in particular,
take necessary measures to avoid \"any political activity.\" 120 As will
be discussed subsequently, the latter will be of relevance by measures
to counter informational hybrid activities as any such activity by
foreign forces to promote a certain political view and NATO policy may
be held to constitute \"political activity,\" infra V.A(d).

Hence, the host nation\'s political governance and law enforcement
remain intact. Foreign forces are stationed in the country only for the
purpose of military exercises, planning, and deterrence measures with,
as a starting point, little or no legal competence to conduct counter
hybrid operations in peace time and crisis.

2\. Possession and carrying of arms by foreign forces and contractors

For any conduct of military exercises, deterrence measures, hybrid
counter operations, clarity on the laws and directives for the handling
of weapons and ammunition is vital. In this regard, military forces are
well-educated and trained to be particularly careful and observant.

According to the NATO SOFA, members of a \"force may possess and carry
arms\" if so authorized by orders whereby \"sympathetic consideration to
request\" from the host nation shall be made. 121Arguably, although the
wording for the NATO SOFA only mentions \"arms\" and, hence, strictly
speaking \"weapons,\" an interpretation in accordance with the context
and object and purpose of the provision would include both weapons and
ammunition. 122The possession and carrying of weapons/ammunition will be
governed by the sending states\' (TCN\'s) law, military regulations on
weapons and ammunition, and the specific directives and orders given to
their forces, but still, due regard shall be had to the host nation
regulations as well. 123

By multi-national forces stationed in a host nation, different military
regulations regarding weapons and ammunition may apply. Moreover, the
national requests may differ in the various host nations concerned, such
as in the Baltic states, Poland, Germany and Denmark. For a
multi-national Headquarters, such as the MNDN, with a distributed
\"Headquarters East\" in Denmark and a \"Headquarters West\" in Latvia
and ongoing duty travel between the two permanent locations, the host
nation\'s legal framework would differ and change constantly. The
varying regulations on weapons and ammunition will create legal
complexity and administrative obstacles and, thus, may hamper timely and
effective reactions to a hybrid campaign. There are good legal and
operational reasons to conclude separate multi-national SOFAs on the
question of arms and ammunition in peacetime and crisis and align the
legal framework of both sending and receiving nations. 124 The \"gap\"
in the NATO SOFA regarding specific directives for handling arms and
ammunition would thereby be closed.

Under Article II of the NATO SOFA, there are two important limitations
on the right which state that members of a \"force may possess and carry
arms\" if so authorized by orders.

Firstly, the granted right under the NATO SOFA that a \"force may
possess and carry arms\" is thus exempted from the host nation\'s public
law regulations on weapons and ammunition as it only applies to the
forces in their performance of military duties in accordance with the
authorization by orders, 125where the sending states (TCNs), in
principle, maintain primary jurisdiction under the NATO SOFA. 126 When
not acting on duty, restrictive public rules on weapons and ammunition
in the host nation may apply, such as the Danish prohibition to import,
produce, collect, purchase, possess, carry and use any kinds of weapons,
including specific knives, without authorization. 127 More flexible and
relaxed weapon regulation for possessing and carrying arms off duty are
usually enforced in other NATO alliance countries, inter alia, the
Baltic states and in particular in the U.S. This is a practical and
legal concern in the jus ante bellum that military personnel in
peacetime and crisis will be temporarily off duty, or on leave, and in
that timespan be subject to perhaps unknown, strict weapons regulation
in the host nation, and in principle punishable for any violation
thereof under the receiving state\'s (host nation) law and jurisdiction.
For foreign troops present in other NATO states, the determination of
when a person is \"on duty\" or \"off duty\" may not always be easy. In
any case, members of foreign forces will have to be educated and trained
in legal compliance with the host nation\'s law and regulations. 128 In
a hybrid campaign, foreign troops are a more vulnerable target for
provocation, threats, attacks, and media exposure while \"off duty,\"
and acts in violation of the host nation\'s law may be exploited by a
hybrid propaganda campaign.

Secondly, [the right under the [NATO SOFA]{.mark} to \"possess and carry
arms\" [only applies to members of a force]{.mark} and **[not]{.mark} to
[civilian]{.mark} component[s]{.mark}**,]{.underline} family members or
sending state contractors, **[[including
PM]{.mark}S[Cs]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Again, host nation law applies,
and the host nation maintains primary or exclusive jurisdiction[. If
[sending states employ civilian]{.mark} component[s]{.mark} and
contractors to perform security and other military tasks requiring them
to carry weapons and potential use of force, this should be regulated
in]{.underline} a bilateral or multi-lateral [SOFA]{.underline}, 129or
in the host nation\'s applicable law. 130 Moreover, [the status of state
contractors is **[not governed by]{.mark} the [NATO
SOFA]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and a specific permission for entry and
stay must be granted. In this connection, [the jurisdiction issue
regarding state contractors should be considered.]{.underline} 131

3\. Use of force and self-defense by foreign forces

AA) THE SOFA \"GAP\" ON THE USE OF FORCE

Neither the NATO SOFA nor the UN Model SOFA address the question of the
source, scope and application of the use of force in self-defense by
foreign forces present on foreign territory. This is a significant
\"gap\" in the standard SOFA regulation.

Rarely do specific bilateral SOFAs deal with this vital question. The
detailed US/Poland SOFA 2009 and the SOFAs between the U.S. and the
Baltic states concluded in 2017, do not address this issue.
Additionally, separate multi-lateral or bilateral SOFAs for major
exercises are normally silent on the issue of use of force and
definition of self-defense. 132 An exception to this silent feature of
SOFA regulations is found in the NATO/German SOFA 1954 concluded after
the end of the occupation regime following the Second World War, where
the permanent stationing of troops in the former West Germany was
regulated. The NATO/German SOFA 1954 (now Revised Supplementary
NATO/German SOFA 1993) requires that the sending state may authorize
\"civilian component and other persons employed in the service of the
force\" to possess and carry arms. However, regarding the use of arms it
must \"issue regulations, which shall conform to the German law on
self-defense ( Notwehr) on the use of arms.\" 133

BB) THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN PERSONAL AND STATE (UNIT) SELF-DEFENSE

The most restricted legal basis for the use of force is self-defense,
which constitutes a generally recognized inherent right of all persons
and, in addition, of all states, their organs and armed forces pursuant
to Article 51 of the UN Charter and customary international law. However
alike, the two forms of self-defense must be strictly distinguished.

The right to personal self-defense derives from the national law
applicable and HRL. It is codified in most national laws and constitutes
a necessary corollary to the right to life under HRL. However, regarding
the source, scope and application the right differs decisively under
various national laws.

The right to state individual or collective self-defense derives from
public international law and is, pending differences in interpretation,
in principle uniform. It is a right vested in a state, its organs and
armed forces, and, thus, includes self-defense of the state armed force
(force self-defense), the so-called \"unit self-defense\" or the defense
of a single soldier in service and performing military duties. 134The
exercise of force, unit or soldier self-defense will follow military
orders and directives, including ROE, where a unit and soldiers can be
ordered not to open fire, cease-fire or withdraw even if the conditions
for state (unit) self-defense under international law are fulfilled.
Moreover, force self-defense is usually a standing order in terms of an
obligation (military duty) and not just an \"inherent\" right. On the
contrary, the right to personal self-defense is generally seen as an
inherent right of a person, which cannot be limited by military orders
or directives. 135

Hence, in any discussion of \"self-defense,\" this divide between
personal self-defense under national law and HRL, and force (unit)
self-defense as part of the right to state self-defense under
international law must be kept in mind.

Regarding the use of force and self-defense by foreign forces, the
inherent right to personal self-defense is, on the one hand, assumed to
be governed by territorial law of the receiving state (host nation)
albeit special agreements between the states concerned. As part of the
right of state self-defense, the right of force/unit self-defense is
governed by international law. The exercise of it depends on how de
facto this is implemented in the law and policy of the sending state and
its military orders and directives. In principle, it does not make any
difference whether this right is exercised on foreign territory.
136Illustrative in this regard is the Danish Royal Standing Order 1952
(still in force) to all Danish armed forces and personnel that in case
of an armed attack on the territory of Denmark or on Danish military
units, including Danish forces present outside Danish territory, Danish
forces must engage in combat without delay and without awaiting or
requesting an order, even when there is no knowledge of a declaration or
state of war. 137It is expressly stated that false orders and
information not to mobilize, resist and interrupt fighting are expected,
and as such may not be followed before there is necessary proof of these
being issued by competent authorities. 138

CC\) RIGHT TO POLICE AND TO ENSURE ORDER AND SECURITY

In the limited regulation on the use of force in the NATO SOFA, \"the
right to police\" and to \"take appropriate measures to ensure the
maintenance of order and security on such premises\" is accorded to
foreign military units and formations inside camps, establishments or
other premises occupied by foreign forces. 139It is not defined what
exactly is covered by a right to police and to maintain order and
security and what kind of use of force is permitted to that end. The
SOFAs between the U.S. and the Baltic states further extend the right
and authority of the U.S. as a sending state and authorize the U.S. on
host nation territory to exercise all necessary rights and authorities
for the use, operation, defense, or control of premises, including
taking appropriate measures to maintain or restore order. Hence, by
these SOFAs, the U.S. is entitled to exercise all rights and authorities
necessary in defense of premises and take appropriate measures to
protect U.S. forces, U.S. contractors, and dependents. 140However, it is
not addressed whether the use of force in exercising all rights in
defense and taking appropriate measures to protect U.S. forces, U.S.
contractors, and dependents are governed by host nation law or U.S. law,
including a presumably more extensive right to personal self-defense
under U.S. law.

Outside such premises, according to the NATO SOFA, any employment of
foreign military police or force is subject to arrangements with the
receiving state (host nation) and only in so far as such employment \"is
necessary to maintain discipline and order among the members of the
force.\" 141For other purposes, the maintenance of internal law and
order is entirely the host nation\'s competence and task. Nevertheless,
the receiving state has the obligation to seek such legislation as it is
deemed necessary to ensure the adequate security and protection of the
foreign forces. 142

DD) THE DILEMMA OF PERSONAL AND STATE SELF-DEFENSE IN MULTINATIONAL
OPERATIONS

When the use of force is not regulated in the NATO SOFA or a separate
supplementary SOFA, the territorial host nation law will apply and
determine the extent to which personal self-defense may be used by
members of foreign military forces, civilian components, dependents, and
contractors. The inherent right to personal self-defense is universally
recognized, but the threshold for an attack or imminent threat of attack
to life or causing of serious personal injury varies, just as the
possibility to use force in self-defense of others and for the
protection of property differs, and the proportionality and necessity
requirement can be very strict or to a wide degree relaxed. 143

If based on an agreement the law of the sending states applies, the
multi-national forces and Headquarters will face a multiplicity of
personal self-defense concepts, and the host nation may have to accept
the use of force in self-defense on its territory beyond what its own
national law permits. Conversely, if the law of the receiving states
(host nation states) applies, there will also be more concepts by
cross-border operations and distributed Headquarters and, rather
critical, some sending states such as the U.S. will see their national
definition of personal self-defense narrowed down \-- perhaps to an
unacceptable degree.

This constitutes the dilemma of personal self-defense in multi-national
operations, which, in principle, is unsolvable. There is no expectation
that a law harmonizing the personal right to self-defense will see the
daylight in a near or foreseeable future at a global or even regional
level. One will have to choose between one of the two options of
applying either the law of the sending states (TCNs) or the law of the
receiving states (host nations). In NATO, the first path of referring to
the sending nation law regarding personal self-defense has been chosen.
Here, the ROE do not limit the inherent right to self-defense under
national law by forces under NATO command and control of foreign
territory. 144This approach may be adopted at a national level in the
ROE issued for peacetime and crisis by a host nation or agreed upon by
separate SOFAs, which then allows foreign forces to use force in
accordance with their own national concept of personal self-defense. 145

Until unity of allied command is established by a Transfer of Authority
(TOA) from each nation to a common military command such as NATO, the
national formations and units will operate under national command and
directives regarding the use of force. This means that various national
ROEs and policies of state (force/unit) self-defense will apply in a low
threshold hybrid warfare theater. The example of the NATO enhanced
Forward Presence (eFP) in the Baltic states and Poland is illustrative;
as of October 2019, the four multinational battalions consist of
rotating troops and staff members from twenty-one countries and four
host nations with consequently multiple policies and interpretations of
force/unit (state) self-defense being applied. 146

This constitutes the dilemma of state (force/unit) self-defense in
multi-national operations and will be the status of the jus ante bellum
and jus in bello until there is a TOA to NATO by all nations involved.
When the allied headquarters is in command, it can and likely will
authorize and issue common ROE, which depending on the situation can
have a defensive or (perhaps dormant) offensive character. 147 By such
ROE, the differences in the national concepts of personal and force
(unit) self-defense can be leveled out by, inter alia, the use of ROE
requiring hostile act and hostile intent for the use of minimum but up
to lethal force. The use of force against persons, units or groups
showing hostile act and hostile intent (perhaps including \"hot
pursuit\') will be in line with the concept of personal and force (unit)
state self-defense of some states and clearly excessive when compared to
national law and directives of others.

The TOA decision is a critical national political matter and the TOA
over national armed forces may come under conditions and, thus, include
reservations and caveats. It is only likely to be granted by states just
prior to or immediately after activation of individual and collective
state self-defense. In a national crisis and in cases of small-scale
armed hostilities with non-state actors and armed groups in parts of the
territory of an alliance state only, the territorial states concerned
may wish to retain command and control of national armed forces and,
thus, for the time being refuse TOA. This disregarding whether the armed
hostilities fall below or exceed the threshold for a NIAC, where in the
latter NIAC scenario, according to the prevailing and convincing view,
the LOAC applicable for a NIAC extends to the entire territory of the
states concerned.

Another and recommendable option \-- even though presumably politically
difficult \-- would be for all states concerned, to agree on common ROE
applicable in peacetime and crisis when taking part in NATO reassurance
measures, either by ad hoc agreements or a supplementary SOFA, and
thereby filling the decisive \"gap\" in the NATO SOFA in the time prior
to TOA to NATO command.

4\. Military Assistance and Support to Law Enforcement and Crisis
Control

The receiving state (host nation) has the sole responsibility and
competence regarding internal security and law enforcement. However, the
host nation can permit, and upon consent receive support from law
enforcement in peacetime and crisis from the military forces and
civilian component of another state present on its territory. The
military forces of the sending states have limited authority, which is
confined to maintaining law and discipline in designated military
facilities, areas, and among members of their forces. Further authority
is not granted under the NATO SOFA and only exceptionally given in
separate bilateral SOFAs. In Article 29(2), the US/Poland SOFA 2009
authorizes exclusively U.S. operations outside such designated areas for
the purpose of protecting U.S. forces and dependents:

Upon request of either Party and with the consent of the appropriate
authorities of the Republic of Poland, United States military
authorities may operate outside of the agreed facilities and areas in
order to ensure security of United States forces and dependents. During
such operations, United States military authorities shall use clear
identification of their special status, and they shall immediately
contact the appropriate authorities of the Republic of Poland and shall
act consistent with their instructions. 148

The legal framework in the host nation, including the applicable HRL
constraints and restraints, and the limits for military support to civil
law enforcement must be clarified. In addition, the sending states\'
(TCN\'s) possible reservations and caveats regarding supporting
operations must be adhered to as well. In any event, such foreign
military support requires, not only specific military and police
training, including legal training, but in particular mutual trust
regarding the performance of law enforcement (police) tasks. The host
nation and TCNs\' caveats may concern the possible military support in
the first place and, if allowed, the specific conditions regarding,
inter alia, police command and control, detention, and use of force in
personal or unit self-defense, in defense of others (civilians),
military equipment, and facilities. Each nation will presumably have
adopted its own legal regime for the military support to police and law
enforcement in peacetime and crisis, which will be designed and shaped
by the national tradition and culture and, thus, constitute a sui
generis regime for each nation. Consequently, an intensive legal
training of incoming foreign forces regarding the host nation\'s
peacetime or emergency law, including the impact of TCN\'s reservations
and caveats, should be made. With the constant routine of in- and
outgoing foreign multi-national forces every third to sixth month in the
territories of the NATO states, placed geographically at the hybrid
threat or warfare frontline, this will be a demanding, time-consuming
and complex task.

In summary, while the NATO SOFA permits alliance state forces to be
present and carry arms on the territory of the receiving host nation,
any assistance and support to a host nation\'s law enforcement by other
states military forces, including the use of force, must be in
accordance with the host nation\'s peacetime and human rights law. While
in times of unrest and crisis, national military force may be empowered
to perform law enforcement tasks under police and/or military command,
foreign forces must be especially authorized by both the sending nation
and the host nation to do so.

A practicable solution \-- but also a rather radical and politically
sensitive one \-- would be to accord to foreign NATO forces the same
authorization to use force in support of police law enforcement as given
to national forces at any point in time. This is the stage of Latvian
law and, thus, the host nation policy at the East Headquarters of MNDN.
As a general statement, the Latvian national rules on the use of force,
including rules on escalation of the use of force, apply to foreign NATO
forces present in Latvia. 149Thus, Latvian law permits foreign NATO
forces to wear uniforms, carry and use weapons in the same way as
Latvian National Armed Forces, and accord them with the relevant rights
of the Latvian National Armed Forces. This includes the right to
individual self-defense under Latvian law, defense of other persons and
to avert an attempt to violently obtain a service firearm. When foreign
forces take part in military guard duties or perform other official
tasks such as support to the police law enforcement in times of
emergency or crisis, they will be authorized to use force in the same
manner as Latvian armed forces. If the sending states approve such a
support by their armed forces, there will be alignment in the peacetime
and crisis Standing Rules for the Use of Force (SRUF). 150Compared with
the law of other states, the use of force permitted by the armed forces
according to Latvian law could be viewed as excessive in peacetime.
However, it signals a necessity to employ military force against certain
hostile and armed activities on the frontline of hybrid threats and
warfare already in peacetime and crisis. The same result in terms of
alignment of the ROE is reached under Lithuanian law by the application
of the peacetime Lithuanian Force Protection ROE 2017 by virtue of
separately agreed MOUs with the sending states of eFP forces, however,
with respect of the application of the personal self-defense according
to national law of the foreign armed forces. 151

Turning from the East Headquarters of MNDN in Riga, Latvia, to the MNDN
West Headquarters in Denmark, the use of force in peacetime and crisis
is entirely a national police task with a possible exclusive supporting
role by Danish armed forces. The possibility for the police to request
military support from Danish armed forces (but not foreign armed forces)
was extended in 2018, but it is still quite limited. It can be provided
regarding a wide range of specific tasks only under the strict
conditions that the resources and capabilities of the police are
insufficient, that supporting operations are under police command and
control, and that the rules governing the competence and the use of
minimum force by the police are followed. 152With the amendment of the
Police Act in 2018, it was made possible to designate specific military
areas for, inter alia, NATO re-enforcement forces, the outer security of
which are secured and guarded by Danish military forces only, and not by
foreign forces. 153

In case of an escalation of a crisis in terms of increasing unrest,
riots and armed hostilities below or even above the \"armed conflict\"
threshold for a NIAC, deviation from the normal peacetime law
enforcement regime may follow a step-by-step or at once enacted national
emergency (martial) law and/or escalation steps taken collectively by
the defense alliance concerned.

b\. Different National Emergency (Martial) Law Regime and Possible
Derogation from HRL

The Baltic states and Poland have been on the frontline of the Russian
hybrid threat and warfare for years and have adapted their national
legislation and planning on emergency, mobilization, re-organization of
governance, civilian support, preparedness and resistance to meet the
hybrid challenges. 154In addition, Poland and the three Baltic states
have entered into bilateral SOFAs with the U.S. in 2009 and 2017, which
supplements the NATO SOFA, and facilitates the presence of U.S. forces.
155Other NATO or PfP states without specific bilateral SOFAs or MOUs are
left with the standard NATO SOFA and its \"gaps\".

Some of the most important issues to be dealt with in the various
national emergency (martial) laws or ad hoc emergency regulations
regarding national and foreign forces are the following: First, the
conditions for possession and carrying of weapons and ammunition. When
on duty, temporally on leave or \"off duty\', military personnel may
need to possess and carry weapons and ammunition as the security
situation may require military personnel and civilian components to be
able to defend themselves at all times. Second, the use of force beyond
mere personal self-defense or unit self-defense when encountering
hostile hybrid activities until TOA and common NATO ROE will apply.
Here, the Latvian regulation aligning the use of force by national and
foreign forces seems to represent a model to follow. 156 Third, the
conditions for own national, bilateral or NATO military support to law
enforcement (the assist/support role). Fourth, the need for legal
education and training of all personnel on exercise in peacetime and
crisis scenarios. This should be prioritized as military forces will
have to operate under a certain national law enforcement regime and
apply the peace time and emergency law of the respective host nations.

The national regulatory approach to a state of emergency or a state of
exception vary from state to state. Here again, a comparison with the
legal state of affairs in Denmark and the Baltic states show a striking
difference, although the countries apply the concept of total state
defense.

Under Danish law, the maintenance of law and order, including law
enforcement, in peacetime and crisis is exclusively the competence of
the civil police with possible support by the Danish armed forces. This
is where civilian and military efforts will be coordinated by local
authorities and the National Operative Staff (\' Den Nationale Operative
Stab\', the so-called NOST) on an ad hoc basis. 157The entire joint
operation will be conducted under the police law enforcement regime and
the use of force applicable in this context. 158There is no national
regulation or law on emergency (martial law) which governs and regulates
the emergency and crisis situations as such. For an international
military staff and its legal advisors in Headquarters such as the MNDN
in Denmark/Latvia, this creates legal challenges as the exact content of
the a d hoc legal regulations and directives in emergency situations to
some extent is uncertain.

Under Latvian law, as well as under Lithuanian and Estonian law, the
state of emergency and state of exception is expressly regulated in a
specific emergency or martial law, which provides clarity and allows for
prior planning accordingly. 159The \"State of Exception\" in Latvia as a
special legal regime can be declared if: 1) the State is endangered by
an external enemy; 2) internal disturbances which endanger the
democratic structure of the State have arisen or are in danger of
arising in the State or any part thereof.\' 160The latter situation
includes civilian unrest, riots and internal conflicts even though this
may fall below the threshold of an internal \"armed conflict\" (NIAC).
161Upon a declaration of a \"State of Exception\', the reasons, time,
territory, set of measures, restrictions and additional duties of
civilians, the tasks of state and local authorities and information to
and recommendations for actions of inhabitants must be stated. 162

As HRL still plays an important role in case of national emergency and
crisis, the possible derogations of applicable human rights law regimes
in times of national emergency and war is a viable and necessary option
for states, in order to ensure compliance with constitutional rights and
HRL treaty law. 163However, this may result in different national
derogations and, thus, an even wider discrepancy of the content of the
host nation\'s emergency (martial) laws and more legal complexity.
164Hence, member States of defense alliances such as NATO should seek to
align their possible derogation from the HRL regime applicable, in
particular regarding those states which are bound to the same regional
HRL treaties. According to the \"derogation clause\" contained in HRL
treaties, a derogation from most provisions is possible:

In time of war or other public emergency threatening the life of the
nation \... may take measures derogating from its obligations under the
Convention to the extent strictly required by the exigencies of the
situation, provided that such measures are not inconsistent with its
other obligations under international law. 165

Not permissive under any circumstances is a derogation from the
provision concerning the right to life (Article 2 of the ECHR), except
in respect of deaths resulting from lawful acts of war, the prohibition
of torture and other forms of ill-treatment (Article 3 of the ECHR), the
prohibition of slavery or servitude (Article 4(1) of the ECHR) and no
punishment without law (Article 7 of the ECHR). 166When the threshold of
an \"armed conflict\" has been exceeded and the LOAC applies, the
special LOAC regime will determine whether lethal use of force is
lawful. 167

This is not the place for a detailed analysis of the conditions and
validity of possible derogations from, inter alia, the ECHR in time of
\"war and other public emergency\'. Nevertheless, from the military
legal advisor\'s point of view, both the de facto declared and possible
future derogations, their content and validity should, if possible, be
considered in planning and executing military operations in a hybrid
crisis and potential armed conflict. Here, it suffices to allude to some
of the legal \"gray zones\" by the interpretation of the HRL
\"derogation clauses.\"

First, the term \"war\" in Article 15(1) of the ECHR has not been
subject to interpretation by the European Court of Human Rights, but
should be held to equal the definition of an \"armed conflict\" in the
meaning of the LOAC, whether a NIAC or an IAC. For the purpose of a HRL
derogation, a \"conflict\" below the threshold of an \"armed conflict\"
will mostly constitute a situation of \"other public emergency
threatening the life of the nation,\" where the European Court of Human
Rights has deferred to the national authorities\' prima facie assessment
as to whether such an exceptional situation exists with subsequent
judicial appreciation. 168 Second, a HRL derogation can be made for a
part of the state, where the \"armed conflict\" or an actual or imminent
crisis in terms of \"other public emergency threatening the life of the
nation\" exists. 169 Third, and most importantly, it is up to each
individual Contracting State, responsible for the life of its nation, to
determine whether the life of the nation is threatened by a \"public
emergency.\" Thus, it is presumably the individual, receiving state
(host nation) which for its territory or a part thereof will have to
declare a HRL derogation. 170

c\. The Dilemma Regarding Use of Private Contractors and Civilian
Resistance

[The use of]{.underline} state contractors ([[PMC]{.underline}]{.mark}
or PMSC) and the use of civilians for the support of military operations
is a delicate legal matter for various reasons.

The employment of state contractors [raises the issues of [lack]{.mark}
of **[c]{.mark}**ommand a**[n]{.mark}**d **[c]{.mark}**ontrol, lack of
disciplinary competence, insurance of [compliance with]{.mark} national
peacetime laws and]{.underline}, when applicable, the
**[[LOAC]{.underline}]{.mark}**, operational security and [jurisdiction
issues]{.underline}. Some states are reluctant regarding the use of
PMSC, others require compliance with specific vetting procedures, and
others may have a general state policy of not using private companies
for any military and security tasks in peacetime and crisis, 171and
involving direct participation in hostilities in case of an armed
conflict. 172Hence, there may be requirements from sending states (TCNs)
for the use of their own PMCs or PMSCs such as U.S. contractors as well
as host nation caveats in this regard. [An important \"gap\" in the NATO
SOFA is present regarding this issue. It may be dealt with differently
in various]{.underline} specific [bilateral SOFAs. When an opponent [in
a hybrid info]{.mark}rmation [campaign]{.mark} is systematically
exploiting mistakes, the possible [misconduct]{.mark} and illegal acts
[of PMC]{.mark}]{.underline} and PMSC employed to be a sending state and
positioned out of reach of the military chain of command **[[poses an
even larger risk]{.underline}]{.mark}** and a legal challenge of
ensuring law compliance in host allied nations.

The voluntary use of civilians to support an armed defense of a state or
the spontaneous appearance and/or encouragement of civilian resistance
(a sort of modern levée en masse) likewise raises legal issues. The
civilian support can constitute acts harmful to the adversary and, thus,
constitute taking direct part in hostilities that lead to loss of
civilian protection. If this is not the case, civilians supporting armed
forces may [risk being part of lawful collateral damage.]{.underline}
Overall, the [[civilian population]{.underline}]{.mark} as such [may be
[endangered]{.mark}]{.underline} as the vital distinction between
civilians and armed resistance (NIAC) or civilians and combatants (IAC)
will be blurred. Moreover, the population in Estonia and Lithuania may
refer to their constitutional duty and right to defend their state
independence and country against armed attack and invasion, as either a
last resort (\"\[i\]f no other means are available\") 173or an
unconditioned duty and right. 174

This \"duty\" and/or \"right\" to conduct civilian resistance depends on
the means available such as weapons (also improvised), ammunition,
cyber/media capabilities among the civilian population, and the
lawfulness of such acts by \" levée en masse\" movements under the LOAC,
which will not be further analyzed here.

d\. Specific Legal Challenges by countering Informational Campaign and
Psychological Operations

A hybrid information campaign, psychological operation, or any other
hostile informational activity regarding fake news will not reach the
threshold of an armed conflict in the sense of an armed attack or
equivalent acts of aggression, but may still constitute an unlawful
threat of attack or other unlawful acts under international law such as
interfering in the internal affairs of other states. If the hybrid
information campaign includes encouragements of the commission of acts
contrary to general principles of humanitarian law and illegal advice in
a distributed manual on psychological operations this would constitute a
violation of LOAC, including the Common Article 3 of the GCs in a NIAC.
175In addition, national law usually limits, prohibits or even
criminalizes certain forms of propaganda for unrest, riots, terror or
other acts of hostilities and war. 176

The means and methods to counter hybrid information campaigns and
psychological operations in peacetime and crisis are limited firstly by
SOFA restrictions such as the general prohibition under the NATO SOFA to
engage in any \"political activity\" in the receiving state, secondly by
HRL restraints, and most importantly, thirdly by the limited extent of
suitable and capable law enforcement measures applicable in peacetime
and crisis. For the most part, counter information measures will have to
be strictly based on facts and truth and will, thus, come too late to
prevent the effect of the hybrid campaign - the countermeasures will
only mitigate the damages. The effective measure against a hybrid
information campaign is a rule of law-based counter and preemptive
information about an existing hybrid threat and warfare, knowledge of
which can build civilian, political and legal resilience.

VI\. CONCLUSION AND THE WAY FORWARD: BUILDING LEGAL RESILIENCE IN JUS
ANTE BELLUM

A defense alliance can undertake various tasks, and the core tasks for
NATO are three: cooperative security, crisis management under Article
3-4 of the NATO treaty, and collective defense under Article 5 of the
NATO treaty. The raison d\'être of NATO is maintaining member state\'s
commitment and support, where legal legitimacy, adherence to legal
values, and member states \"rule of law\" policies are essential parts.

The legal interoperability and legal resilience are, however, decisively
challenged by a hybrid threat and warfare mostly conducted just below,
or in the \"gray-zone\" of the threshold for armed conflict and, thus,
apparently in a peacetime or crisis legal setting. Here, the framework
for a response by individual states and NATO, as such, is to some degree
uncertain, different from nation to nation and imposing legal
constraints, making it difficult and complex to respond effectively.
These legal challenges and \"gaps\" within the jus ante bellum and
additional gray-zones in the jus ad bellum and jus in bello - some of
which are analyzed above - will have to be considered more thoroughly by
defense alliances, such as NATO, and its member states with the purpose
of building and increasing legal resilience. 177

On the one hand, the legal framework of the jus in bello applicable in
case of an armed conflict and the activation of individual and
collective self-defense according to Article 5 of the NATO Treaty is
well-codified at the international level and/or supplemented by
customary international law, although a number of key issues remain
unregulated and/or disputed. The critical issue is not the content of
the law governing the conduct of hostilities but rather the conditions
for the applicability of the jus in bello. This grayzone area of the
threshold for a NIAC (organization, intensity and territorial control)
and an IAC (attribution of hostile activities to states in terms of
\"effective control\" or \"overall control\") gives ample options for
the conduct of hybrid campaigns.

On the other hand, the jus ad bellum is covered by several gray zones
and uncertainties, which in a hybrid threat and warfare setting create
significant legal \"gaps\" to be exploited by, in particular,
non-law-abiding states and non-state actors. The unclear and disputed
\"gravity\" requirement and the unsettled issue of a possible use of
force under the disguise of a \"humanitarian intervention\" are symbolic
in this regard.

Apparently, the case law of the ICJ is based on a ratio of restricting
the right to use force (the jus ad bellum regime) by setting a gravity
requirement for the jus ad bellum, a formalistic approach to (collective
self-defense) and a highly effective control test for state attribution,
which all seem out of tune with the realities of hybrid threats and
warfare. Such a restrictive and formalistic view of international law
may turn out to achieve the exact opposite; it opens several windows of
opportunity for an asymmetric hybrid warfare below the critical
threshold for the right to war ( jus ad bellum) and narrows down the
possibility to create effective deterrence policies and apply effective
countermeasures.

Most importantly, the legal regime applicable before a situation of
state self-defense and an armed conflict is, to a large extent, national
and not international and uniform. Thus, the content of jus ante bellum
applicable in each state differs significantly and is only in some
areas, such as HRL, aligned. The supporting treaty framework for NATO
operations mainly focuses on whether and on what conditions foreign
forces, Headquarters, and NATO as an organization, national
representatives to NATO and international staff to NATO can be present
in alliance or partner states (questions of entry, status and
jurisdiction). However, these agreements and [**[bilateral SOFAs do not
address how]{.mark} and to what extent [foreign forces can]{.mark} act,
[use force, support security]{.mark}** and crisis management under
Articles 3-4 of the NATO treaty and be used in supporting law
enforcement in a state of emergency or martial law. This is a decisive
regulative and an alignment \"gap\" in the existing the SOFA
regime.]{.underline} The national emergency (martial) law and the
applicable HRL with possible national derogations in times of crisis
provoked by a hybrid warfare differ decisively, which reduces the
important legal resilience in [jus ante bellum.]{.underline}

[The possible way forward is to build more legal resilience in the jus
ante bellum and align the current views and interpretations of
international law]{.underline}, including the jus ad bellum, jus in
bello and jus post bellum in order to meet the legal challenges of
hybrid threats and warfare. [[If]{.underline}]{.mark} a defense
alliance, such as [[NATO, wants to effectively counter]{.mark} the
ongoing and future [hybrid]{.mark} threats and [war]{.mark}fare, the
aspects of [legal resilience]{.mark} and robustness [must be]{.mark} an
[integrated]{.mark} part.]{.underline} Therefore, it is recommended that
a NATO Center of Excellence on Legal Resilience (Legal Resilience CoE)
is set up with this main task. Research should inter alia be conducted
on: (i) the various gray zones and \"gaps\" in international law, the
LOAC and HRL; (ii) the different national peacetime and emergency
regulations and how these could be improved, aligned and model laws
drafted; and (iii) a possible reform of existing SOFAs by drafting new
model SOFAs, which address the significant \"gaps\" in the current SOFA
regulation.

Registration and Licensing for PMCs to Establish
Legitimacy]{.mark}]{.underline}** The licensing process should clearly
distinguish the legitimate PMC from the lone mercenary in the eyes of
the international community, by vetting the backgrounds of the PMC's
employees.154 The international community should shun any PMC that does
not go through the licensing process,155 [although some
[countries]{.mark} may chose to ignore]{.underline} the
[requirements]{.underline} of international registration and hire non-
accredited PMCs at their peril.156 But those [states [run the risk of
becoming tainted by the **actions of PMCs**]{.mark} on their behalf
[that]{.mark} may **[reflect poorly on the state]{.mark}.**157 It is
also in a PMC's interest to become internationally licensed so the PMC
may present the license as a clear, international approval of the
PMC]{.underline}, distinguishing it from the illegal operator.158
Furthermore, if PMCs choose not to seek a license, the stigma of
[[being]{.mark} an [unaccredited]{.mark} PMC [could have an impact on
their global business]{.mark}]{.underline}.159 [[It is also in the
interest of the PMCs]{.mark} themselves [to have a uniform,
international standard rather than risk]{.mark} the [uneven application
of laws to]{.mark} their [employees in different
countries]{.mark}.]{.underline}160 4. The U.S. Must Champion the
Initiative to Draft a PMC Convention The absence of U.S. support for the
1977 and 1989 definitions of mercenaries has only weakened the impact of
the resulting international conventions.161 Since the flood of private
military firms is a result of the build up of Cold War forces, and the
consequent draw down of military forces during the 1990s, it is vital
that the United States, its allies, and the former Soviet Bloc states
take the forefront of revising international law.162 The [[U.S. failure
to **implement a strict domestic licensing and oversight**]{.mark}
regime regulating the PMCs accompanying military forces [weakens the
effect of]{.mark} any [U.S. law.]{.mark}]{.underline}163 In particular,
[[the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [should take the
lead]{.mark} in an international solution [because of the]{.mark} highly
visible [problems in Iraq with private military firms]{.mark} that are
[working for U.S. government agencies]{.mark}.]{.underline}164
Furthermore, **[the [support of major state powers like the]{.mark}
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates and its allies [will ensure the new
convention is speedily implemented]{.mark},]{.underline}** and does not
sit idle for decades like the U.N. Convention.165

### Gunboat Diplomacy\-\--1AC

#### NATO will overapply article V to [any]{.underline} hybrid threat which [unravels]{.underline} the international legal order and expands use of force justifications

Volume 10,

[The **legal challenges**]{.underline} [that hybrid threats present for
collective security guarantees have been recognized]{.underline} at the
highest political level. [At their Warsaw summit held in July 2016,
NATO's member states confirmed]{.underline} their [readiness to assist
each other at any stage of a hybrid campaign and to counter hybrid
warfare]{.underline} as part of collective defense.294
[They]{.underline} also [underscored]{.underline} that the [North
Atlantic Council "could decide to **invoke Article 5**]{.underline} of
the Washington Treaty."295 They repeated these points at their Brussels
summit in July 2018.296 [By drawing an **express link** between **hybrid
warfare** and]{.underline} **[collective defense]{.underline}**, [NATO
leaders **signaled their resolve** not to allow Article 5 to be
**hollowed out**]{.underline}.297 [Still]{.underline}, [their
declarations of **intent** strike a rather]{.underline} **[conservative
note.]{.underline}** Whilst they accept that NATO may assist an Ally at
any stage of a "hybrid campaign," it is only in cases of "hybrid
warfare" that they foresee a potential role for Article 5. This is not
an unreasonable position to take. As we saw earlier, [recourse to the
[use of force to counter]{.mark} [hybrid threats falling
**below**]{.mark} **the threshold of [an armed
attack]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[is neither
**permissible**]{.underline}]{.mark} [n[or]{.mark}]{.underline}
necessarily **[[appropriate]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [A [pledge to
invoke]{.mark} the mutual defense [commitment in response to
**every**]{.mark} **type of [hybrid threat]{.mark}** [would]{.mark} be a
promise to **[use the]{.mark} proverbial [sledgehammer to crack a
nut]{.mark}.** It [would be **unrealistic** and]{.mark} therefore
[**lack credibility**]{.mark} in the eyes of hybrid
**adversaries**]{.underline}.298 [By accepting that the role of Article
5 is **confined** to situations of hybrid warfare, the]{.underline}
[Warsaw and Brussels Summit Declarations]{.underline}
[avoid]{.underline} such **[empty gestures]{.underline}**.
[However]{.underline}, in the same breath [they also concede that the
application of Article 5 is contingent on]{.underline} [the legal
threshold between warfare and peace, and thus **vulnerable to
subversion**]{.underline} along the lines discussed in the preceding
sections.

[It may be tempting to deal with the problem of legal thresholds by
**attempting to escape them**]{.underline} [altogether]{.underline},
[but **this is not a feasible strategy**]{.underline}. [Even if the
contracting parties were to **revise Article 5** NAT]{.underline} and
Article 42(7) TEU [to avoid references to "armed attack" and "armed
aggression,"]{.underline}299 [they would remain bound by the rules
governing the use of force under the UN Charter and customary
international law]{.underline}. Although the member states of NATO and
the EU make up an influential part of the international community, it is
not within their ability to adjust these general rules of international
law unilaterally. In any event, [**[lowering the threshold for]{.mark}
the [use of force]{.mark}** in order [to **facilitate**]{.mark} **the
[application of Article 5]{.mark}**]{.underline} and Article 42(7)
[[would]{.mark} **come with significant costs**]{.underline}, [since it
would **[loosen]{.mark} the [legal restrictions for all
states,]{.mark}**]{.underline} **[[including hostile
powers]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [The applicable thresholds therefore
**cannot be unilaterally modified at will**]{.underline} and [without
the [risk]{.mark} [of **unraveling**]{.mark} **key elements of [the
international legal order]{.mark}**]{.underline} as it currently stands.

[[A more **promising approach** is to **strengthen legal
interoperability**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[among
NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} and EU [nations]{.underline}. [One line of
effort is to **[reduce legal gray zones]{.mark}**]{.underline},300 for
example [[by **narrowing disagreements**]{.mark} over the gap that lies
between the definition of force and armed attack]{.underline}. [This
could prepare the ground for [develop]{.mark}ing [a]{.mark} **[shared
understanding]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[of **what**]{.mark} **kind of
[hybrid threats]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[may trigger]{.mark} the
applicability of [Article 5]{.mark} NAT]{.underline} and Article 42(7)
TEU. Given that the assessment of any security threat depends heavily on
its context, it may prove somewhat sterile to build such a consensus in
the abstract. Drawing on war-gaming and exercises may offer a more
fruitful way forward. Bearing in mind how attractive the use of proxies
is to a hybrid state adversary,301 developing a common approach to
attribute their activities to the sponsoring state also merits
attention. Although many aspects of the rules governing the attribution
of wrongful acts are settled, certain questions could benefit from a
joint posture.302 NATO and EU nations should also strengthen their
collective mechanisms for unmasking attempts at plausible deniability in
order to deny its use as a hybrid instrument,303 as illustrated by their
united response to the Skripal incident and to Russian cyber
operations.304

#### Otherwise, the status quo legal precedent will be [exploited by adversaries]{.underline} to make war [more likely]{.underline} in [every theater]{.underline} and signals a return to [gunboat diplomacy]{.underline} -- great power war

**Terry '19** \[Patrick; Feb; dean of the faculty of law at the
University of Public Administration in Kehl, Germany; "The Return of
Gunboat Diplomacy: How the West has Undermined the Ban on the Use of
Force," Harvard National Security Journal Volume 10,
https://harvardnsj.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2019/02/Return-of-Gunboat-Diplomacy.pdf\]

This article explores how [the "West,"]{.underline} [the main creator of
modern international law]{.underline} after WWII, [is]{.underline} now,
nevertheless, **[steadily undermining it.]{.underline}** [While
purporting to be reemphasizing each state's right to defend itself and
elevating]{.underline} the protection of [human rights, [the West
is]{.mark},]{.underline} in truth, [[rendering]{.mark} the]{.underline}
far-reaching [[ban on]{.mark} the [use of force]{.mark} envisaged in the
U.N. Charter **[ineffective]{.mark}**]{.underline}, thereby [paving the
ground for a return to]{.underline} [19th century]{.underline}
**[gunboat diplomacy]{.underline}**.1 [This]{.underline} [new age of
international law is marked by the use of force [no longer]{.mark} being
[governed by]{.mark} the **[rule of law]{.mark}**,]{.underline} [but
rather almost exclusively by the raw power of states]{.underline}---a
fact western politicians attempt to conceal by issuing dubious, often
hypocritical, but wellsounding statements. These states have abandoned
the---perhaps utopian---goal of realizing the principle of sovereign
equality and are increasingly replacing it with an aggressively
hierarchical order of states reminiscent of the colonial era of the 19th
century.

Seemingly [disparate western forces are **eroding the ban on the use of
force**]{.underline}: [right-wing
interventionists]{.underline}---predominantly, but not exclusively---to
be found in the United States, [and]{.underline} [so-called
liberals]{.underline} spread across the West. [Common to both approaches
is the argument that international law is steadily and necessarily
**evolving to adapt to developments in the modern world**.]{.underline}

There are supposedly stark differences between right wing and liberal
approaches to international law. Right-wing interventionists tend to be
quite open about their disdain for international law, sometimes even
claiming that law does not and/or has never governed international
relations and that outcomes are ultimately the result of the involved
states' relative power.2 Others, such as Michael Glennon, do accept that
international law has a role to play in foreign affairs, but argue that
its rules should flexibly adjust to the major powers' relative
strength.3 Furthermore, right-wing interventionists tend to focus their
arguments on the rules governing the use of force while the liberals'
reforming zeal is generally broader.

The [liberal approach tends to emphasize its strict adherence to the
rule of law in international affairs. Liberals, however, often argue
that international law, especially customary international law, is
**evolving**]{.underline} under the influence of international human
rights law. It is no longer the state, but the individual human being
that is becoming and should become the focus of international law.4 This
has allegedly led to the emergence of a right to intervene abroad on
humanitarian grounds. More extreme advocates of the liberal strand of
thought have even justified interventions in order to install/reinstate
a "democratic" government. At this point, some liberal and right-wing
scholars have in fact found limited common ground, as this argument can
readily serve to justify the right-wing interventionists' general
"regime change" agenda in "rogue states."

This article will show both strands of thought to be similarly harmful
to the international rule of law. Both necessarily require the
acceptance of a hierarchy of states, based on their relative power, and
both rely on the United States' alleged exceptionalism as leader of the
Free World and the West's unparalleled strength following the Eastern
Bloc's collapse in the early 1990s. Since then, the widespread
assumption has been that only the United States and its close allies
could retain the capabilities to rely on more generous rules permitting
the use of force.

As we near the end of the second decade of the 21st century, this
**[[blasé attitude]{.underline}]{.mark}** towards the rest of the world
[has [turned]{.mark} [out]{.mark} to be [misplaced]{.mark}. Rather,
[countries]{.mark}]{.underline} as diverse as [**[Russia]{.underline}**,
**[Saudi Arabia]{.underline}**]{.mark},
**[[Colombia]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and
**[[Turkey]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[have]{.underline}]{.mark}
[increasingly [come to rely on]{.mark} **ever-[expanding exceptions to
the ban on the use of force]{.mark}**]{.underline} [first advocated by
the West]{.underline}. [Consequently, we are [witnessing]{.mark} a
**[return to gunboat diplomacy]{.mark}**]{.underline}: [[states that
feel powerful]{.mark} enough [to intervene]{.mark}]{.underline}
forcefully [[in another state's]{.mark} internal [affairs will]{.mark}
do so and **[claim justification]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[based
on]{.mark} the often **[ill-defined]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} **[ill-advised [rules]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[that]{.underline} right-wing interventionists and [liberals have tried
to impose]{.underline}. [The rule of law is thus again
being]{.underline} **[replaced]{.underline}** [by the Darwinian
principle of the "survival of the fittest]{.underline}." Meanwhile, [we
are steadily approaching the point]{.underline} Glennon claims we have
already passed,5 [whereby]{.underline} the [[jus ad
bellum]{.underline}]{.mark} [has [become]{.mark}
**[indeterminate]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [meaning]{.underline} that
**[[few]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[if any]{.underline}**, [[constraining
rules]{.mark} on the use of force [remain]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Recent developments illustrate this: the United States did not even
bother to put forward a serious legal argument to justify its attacks on
Syrian forces]{.underline} in 2017 and 2018 in retaliation for their
alleged use of chemical weapons. The [frequent [recourse to]{.mark}
[force **irrespective of i**]{.mark}**nternational
[law]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [as practiced by western and]{.underline},
[increasingly, other states has [led to]{.mark} a widespread **[increase
in spending on]{.mark} defensive and [offensive
capabilities]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [States wish to protect both their
sovereignty and standing in the new hierarchy of states,]{.underline}
and many of them have presumably come to the same conclusion as India
already had in 2003, following the United States' and the U.K.'s
unlawful attack on Iraq: disagreement with the United States requires
the possession of nuclear weapons.6

The article will focus on the two areas of the law on the use of force
where the effect of western thought has contributed to the serious
weakening of legal structures. First, I will examine the erosion of the
law on self-defense in some detail, before subsequently turning to the
attempts to justify the use of force in other cases, notably during
humanitarian crises. I will first outline the arguments in support of an
expansive view of the right to resort to force before assessing them
according to the U.N. Charter, the jurisprudence of the International
Court of Justice (hereinafter ICJ) and traditional customary
international law. This will be followed by an exposé of state practice
and opinio juris. Finally, a brief conclusion will summarize the current
state of affairs.

This analysis will demonstrate that [successive attempts at
"modernizing" international law are in danger of]{.underline}
[**dismantling the safeguards against war** and of recreating a world in
which a few privileged states can attempt to impose]{.underline} [their
will on the rest.]{.underline} The logic of an ever-expanding concept of
justified military action selfevidently reveals a hierarchal view of the
international community: only the wealthy and privileged western states
and their close allies should benefit from such generous rules. [It [was
never in the West's interest that]{.mark} other states, such as [Russia,
China]{.mark}, or India [should invoke an **expansive view**]{.mark} [of
the right to use force]{.mark}. **[However]{.mark}**, as recent
developments illustrate, [the West]{.mark} has
**[miscalculated]{.mark}**; its power is no longer sufficient to stop
other states from **exploiting its dubious precedents.**]{.underline}

[[The U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates and Europe [cannot be
**complacent**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[about]{.mark} the **[risk]{.mark}
of conflict** [in the **East**]{.mark}**ern
[Med]{.mark}iterranean.**]{.underline} Alongside the dangerous situation
in the South China Sea, [[the]{.mark} deepening [confrontation]{.mark}
in the Aegean and in the waters off Cyprus, Crete, and Libya [is]{.mark}
arguably [the **most serious and immediate security
flashpoint**]{.mark}]{.underline} facing transatlantic partners
[today]{.underline}. [The [crisis poses **key tests** for
**NATO**]{.mark}]{.underline} and the European Union. On the face of it,
the crisis has been driven by maritime demarcation disputes affecting
offshore energy exploration and transport. These [differences are
**longstanding**]{.underline} [and could be **amenable**]{.underline}
[to **legal** and **diplomatic** solutions. **However**]{.underline},
**[current brinkmanship]{.underline}** is not really about energy per
se, and it [is being shaped by wider strategic
developments]{.underline}.

**[Greek-Turkish relations]{.underline}** [are at the
**core**]{.underline}. [The **[détente]{.mark}** that has prevailed
between Athens and Ankara since the late 1990s [is on the **verge of
collapse**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[This would]{.underline}]{.mark}
[have]{.underline} **[profound [implicat]{.mark}ions]{.underline}** [for
[**regional stability** and **NATO's ability to function**]{.mark} in
the face of **pressing security demand** emanating from the Levant,
North Africa, and around the Mediterranean]{.underline}. [**[Even if the
immediate threat]{.mark} of conflict [can be contained,]{.mark} the**
alliance could be faced with a **return** to the **[tense
conditions]{.mark}**]{.underline} [that prevailed for decades and
**[impede]{.mark}d [NATO solidarity and
operations]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

[There have been profound changes on both sides. [Turkey]{.mark} has
**[lost its inhibitions]{.mark}** regarding power projection. It has
[become a more **independent**]{.mark} a]{.underline}nd
[**[assertive]{.underline}** [actor,]{.underline}]{.mark} [encouraged by
**operational successes**]{.underline} [in Syria and Libya.]{.underline}
The country has also rediscovered its maritime interests and strategy.
And at a time of over-heated nationalism, Cyprus and sovereignty
concerns in the Aegean and beyond are nationalist issues par excellence
across the political spectrum. [Ankara has **few
supporters**]{.underline} [for its **assertive posture**]{.underline} in
Europe or [among **NATO allies**]{.underline}, [who are **already deeply
troubled**]{.underline} [by]{.underline} President [Erdogan's rhetoric
and authoritarianism]{.underline}, the S-400 deal with Russia, and
Ankara's policy in Syria and Libya.

Greece, for its part, has never been closer to its transatlantic
partners. Differences over finances aside, Athens is now fully in the
European mainstream on key policy questions. Greek-American security
cooperation has expanded significantly over the last decade, spanning
changes of administration in Athens and Washington. Support from
transatlantic allies and regional actors such Egypt and the UAE has
encouraged a tougher stance in Athens where maritime sovereignty issues
are central to the national narrative.

Both Greece and Turkey would have much to lose from an actual
conflict---a reality acknowledged by all sides. It is enough to note
that the tourist economy dwarfs the energy stakes on both sides of the
Aegean. The coronavirus pandemic and the economic crisis affecting both
countries underscore this reality. A Greek-Turkish clash would impose
tremendous costs and would likely result in Turkey's open-ended
estrangement from Western partners. It would pose huge challenges for
NATO cohesion and operations. Moscow might be the only beneficiary.

[Greece and Turkey are at the center of this maelstrom. But **[unlike
past periods]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[of **regional
brinkmanship**]{.underline},]{.mark} [many [**more actors** are
**engaged** **politically**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[and]{.underline}
**[militarily]{.underline}**]{.mark} [this time. [The
**U**]{.mark}**nited [S]{.mark}tates**, **[Russia]{.mark}**,
[**France**, **Egypt**, **Israel**]{.mark}, [**Cyprus**, **Italy**, and
the **UAE**]{.mark} [are]{.mark} among the countries [conducting
**naval**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[and]{.underline} **[air]{.underline}**
[operations]{.underline}]{.mark} [in the Eastern
Mediterranean.]{.underline} [The [potential for
**accidents**]{.mark}]{.underline}, **[misjudgment]{.underline}**,
[[and]{.underline} **[escalation]{.underline}** [has **increased
substantially**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Recent incidents between French
and Turkish ships and a glancing collision between Greek and Turkish
frigates in mid-August illustrate the risk. [Things can and do go
wrong---**and can easily get out of control**.]{.underline}

### Cohesion Adv\-\--1AC

#### Russian cyberattacks are [inevitable]{.underline} - tying cyber-attacks to Article V prevents [meaningful]{.underline} cyber defense

**Blessing 22** - Jeane Kirkpatrick Visiting Research Fellow at the
American Enterprise Institute, where he focuses on cybersecurity,
military cyber forces, military technological transformation and force
structure, US cyber defense policy including civilian-military dynamics
in cyberspace, and cyber defense agreements (Jason, "The Russian Cyber
Threat Is Here to Stay and NATO Needs to Understand It," AEI, 4-25-2022,
<https://www.aei.org/op-eds/the-russian-cyber-threat-is-here-to-stay-and-nato-needs-to-understand-it/>)
//nt-sg

[Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Biden administration has
escalated warnings about likely Russian cyber-attacks on American
infrastructure and business.]{.underline} More worrying still, cyber
alarmists like Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Mark Warner,
D-Va., have suggested that cyber-attacks from the Kremlin could be acts
of war that trigger NATO's collective defense.

[This sky-is-falling **delusion**]{.underline}, particularly from
leaders with access to classified intelligence, [is at best
**counterproductive** and at worst **dangerous**.]{.underline}

[Cyber-attacks are **rarely** acts of war, and treating them as if they
are **undermines** NATO's ability to deal with real threats short of
cyber war.]{.underline}

NATO has only invoked Article 5 -- which triggers a collective response
-- once and that was after the 9/11 attacks.

[Cyber-attacks are unlikely to destroy buildings and kill thousands in
an instant]{.underline}. While collective defense extends to cyberspace,
[few operations could **realistically** be a cause for war.]{.underline}

[This would include cyber-attacks resulting in death or damage like
traditional military operations or coordinated assaults that take the
power grid or entire economic sectors offline. These scenarios are
unlikely though: such attacks **require far too much time, funding,
manpower, and control**. Instead, most attacks temporarily overwhelm
servers with traffic, deny network access, hold computers hostage, and
steal or delete data.]{.underline}

[Even if allies wanted to trigger Article 5 over cyber operations,
**disagreements** about the definitions of threats, origins of attacks,
and pain thresholds in cyberspace can **derail the
process**.]{.underline}

[Collective retaliation requires a unanimous vote across NATO; building
unity across these points is **nearly impossible** for most cyber
activity. Unlike missile attacks or tanks in the streets, few "red
lines" exist to distinguish cybercrime, cyber espionage, and cyber
disruption from digital acts of war.]{.underline}

Beyond the bureaucratic and logistical limitations of elevating cyber to
a casus belli, [focusing on cyber-attacks as acts of war **distracts**
from the more likely Russian digital assaults below the level of armed
conflict. These include ransomware attacks and supply chain
infiltrations that look like criminal activity or
espionage.]{.underline}

[The Kremlin is particularly adept at the latter]{.underline}. In the
SolarWinds compromise, Russia hacked one company's software product to
access networks of Fortune 500 companies and U.S. government agencies.

[Spillover from operations in Ukraine poses an **additional risk.** The
Russians have already deployed several digital tools to destroy computer
data, resulting in corrupted computers for Ukrainian companies with
government support roles. The same malicious software has also affected
several Latvian and Lithuanian businesses.]{.underline}

The danger is another situation like NotPetya in 2017, where malware
self-replicated, spread past Ukrainian targets to cripple networks in
over 150 countries, and created \$10 billion in damages.

[Each of these scenarios are **much more likely** than a "cyber
doomsday" that would justify an Article 5 response]{.underline} from
NATO members.

To be fair, policymakers' fears of cyber war have led to some positive
developments for the alliance. For instance, over the last several
years, NATO has developed its own framework for combining cyber and
conventional military capabilities in warfighting. But [allies **remain
unprepared** to deal with "death by 1000 cuts" in
cyberspace.]{.underline}

[Concentrating only on acts of war **comes at the expense** of
addressing the cumulative costs of low-level cyber threats over time. It
leads to an **overreliance** on cyber deterrence or defensive
whack-a-mole strategies, **neither of which are
sustainable**.]{.underline}

[Threats of retaliation **simply don't deter** most cyber-attacks, and
it is unrealistic for defensive measures to stop every
hacker.]{.underline}

[Policymakers across NATO must acknowledge]{.underline} that security
failures are the norm in cyberspace, and [that the compounding costs of
failure over time are **every bit as dangerous** as the threat of cyber
war.]{.underline}

[Building cyber resilience is an important step forward]{.underline}. It
acknowledges that, in many cases, the Russians will get the best of us
in cyberspace. The focus is on controlling failures to limit damage and
quickly get networks back online.

Moving from buzzword to actual strategy requires addressing several
questions. Which digital assets are most significant? Where is the
alliance most exposed to Russian cyber-attacks? Where should NATO reduce
operating risks, and in what areas can it assume more? How can allies
track long-term trends and adapt to new technologies?

[The Russian cyber threat is here to stay]{.underline}. Collective
defense is -- and should remain -- the cornerstone of NATO. But [**time
is running out** for the alliance to protect itself from scenarios that
aren't all-out cyber war.]{.underline}

[The GAO examined cybersecurity assessment reports]{.underline} from
certain programs tested between 2012 and 2017, [and found that programs
across every service regularly identified "**mission-critical cyber
vulnerabilities**."]{.underline} For legitimate national security
concerns, the GAO report does not specify the programs under review, but
it does say [auditors investigated a variety of weapons]{.underline},
including ships and aircraft, as well as communications systems. ["Using
relatively **simple tools and techniques**, testers were able to take
control of systems and largely operate undetected, due in part to
**basic issues**]{.underline} such as poor password management and
unencrypted communications." [This echoes a warning from former Pentagon
testing director Dr. J. Michael Gilmore]{.underline}, who wrote in 2014
that "the cyber threat has become as real a threat to U.S. military
forces as the missile, artillery, aviation, and electronic warfare
threats."

[In spite of the danger posed by hackers, the services have **not always
been diligent** in ensuring the security of their
systems]{.underline}---like in 2015, when the F-35 Joint Program Office
canceled a cyber test, citing concerns that the test could damage the
troubled fighter jet's computer system, and in so doing actually
confirmed the need for such a test in the first place. Attitudes like
this appear to be part of the new normal: [the evaluators for this
report found "program officials GAO met with **believed their systems
were secure** and discounted some test results as
unrealistic]{.underline}."

[Cyberspace is often used to **gain advantage** over
enemies]{.underline}, whether it is through cyber espionage campaigns,
coordinated cyber-attacks on private industries, or major attacks on
critical infrastructure[. A weaker state launching a cyber-attack
against a stronger state, such as the United States, is certainly within
the realm of possibility. If a weaker state were able to deny access to,
or take control of, a stronger state's NC3 systems through a coordinated
cyber-]{.underline}attack, there could be devastating results, the worst
being **[all out nuclear war]{.underline}**. Currently,
[two]{.underline} weaker [states that present this concern to the United
States are **Iran and North Korea**.]{.underline}

Within the past decade, [the Iranian cyber program has undergone
significant improvement. They have been accused of multiple different
cyber-attacks against the United States]{.underline}, as well as actors
within their own region. These attacks showcased Iran's cyber
capabilities and underscored that [Iran is **not afraid** to launch
major cyber-attacks against the United States and other powerful
entities. Iran recently entered into a **cyber agreement with Russia**,
which includes a new emphasis on training and cooperation between these
two countries. This agreement,]{.underline} coupled with Iran's
continuous development of its own cyber capabilities, [makes Iran a
**critical cyber threat** to the United States;]{.underline} this threat
is [exacerbated by the high tensions between our two
states.]{.underline}

There have also been multiple reports stating that [North Korean hackers
present a **more tangible threat than their nuclear
missiles**.]{.underline} The premise is that [their hackers are at work
**every** **day** infiltrating and stealing information]{.underline}
from various systems. [North Korean hackers and cyber organizations have
been tied to multiple attacks]{.underline} within this past decade.
[These attacks have demonstrated the expertise of their organizations
and a **willingness to attack high-profile targets**]{.underline} such
as Sony, Microsoft, and other major establishments. [North Korean
hackers]{.underline} have been [recognized as **some of the best in the
world** at finding and exploiting vulnerabilities within a
system.]{.underline} The assertions regarding North Korea, in addition
to their immense history of cyber-attacks, make North Korea a constant
threat in cyberspace. [Tensions between our two countries amplifies this
threat.]{.underline}

Unfortunately, [the cyber threat presented by Iran and North Korea has
become **more realistic and tangible** over the past decade. Their
capabilities are becoming increasingly complex, and they are emboldened
to attack high-profile targets to showcase their abilities. These two
countries]{.underline}, although historically considered weak in
comparison to the United States[, present a **major concern** to
U.S.]{.underline} systems, including U.S. [NC3 systems]{.underline},
because of their advanced cyber capabilities and their ability to gain
major advantages through a coordinated cyber operation against these
systems.

#### NoKo escalation likely\-\--they're exploiting global attention on Ukraine to ramp up nuclear provocations 

**Terry '22** \[Sue Mi; March 24; Director of the Wilson Center's
Hyundai Motor-Korea Foundation Center for Korean History and Public
Policy, former CIA analyst, served on the National Intelligence Council
in 2009--10 and the National Security Council in 2008--9; Foreign
Affairs, "North Korea's Nuclear Opportunism,"

[[With the]{.underline}]{.mark} entire [[world focused on
Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}, **[[No]{.underline}]{.mark}**rth
**[[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}**rea [[launched its
first]{.underline}]{.mark} intercontinental ballistic missile
([[ICBM]{.underline}]{.mark}) [[since 2017]{.underline}]{.mark} on
Thursday. The long-range missile, which is designed to carry nuclear
weapons, should be seen as **[[a major escalation]{.underline}]{.mark}**
by North Korea.

U.S. and South Korean officials had warned that such a long-range
missile test was coming and the war in Ukraine presented the perfect
opportunity for North Korea to make trouble, knowing that the United
States and other powers would be distracted. Now that North Korea has
resumed its ICBM testing, the Biden administration must be ready for a
flare-up on the Korean Peninsula even as Russian President Vladimir
Putin causes bloodshed and threatens nuclear war in Ukraine. [[This
could be the sleeper crisis of 2022.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The Russian invasion of [[Ukraine will only
redouble]{.underline}]{.mark} North Korean leader
[[Kim]{.underline}]{.mark} Jong Un[['s]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[determination to expand his nuclear arsenal]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
[Kim knows that under the 1994 Budapest Memorandum]{.underline}, Ukraine
gave up the nuclear weapons it inherited from the Soviet Union, and he
no doubt figures that if Ukraine were still a nuclear power, Russia
would not have dared to attack. For Kim, Ukraine's experience only
reinforces the lessons that his fellow dictators in Iraq and Libya
learned the hard way: countries that give up their nuclear weapons
programs become vulnerable, and their leaders face serious risks of
being overthrown and killed.

There are multiple reasons to be concerned that North Korea will
continue to carry out missile tests, a nuclear test, or other
provocations in the coming year. First, the regime in Pyongyang has a
history of greeting incoming South Korean presidents with threats. Yoon
Suk-yeol, the conservative candidate who won the South Korean
presidential election earlier this month, has already signaled that he
will pursue a tougher policy toward North Korea. The last time a
conservative president was elected in South Korea---Park Geun-hye---Kim
conducted North Korea's third nuclear test just weeks before her
inauguration in February 2013. Progressive presidents have hardly gotten
a pass: in 2017, during the first four months of Moon Jae-in's
presidency, North Korea conducted its sixth nuclear weapons test (of a
hydrogen bomb) and two intercontinental ballistic missile tests. (A
third ICBM, capable of reaching targets in the entire United States,
followed later in the year.)

This year also has symbolic resonance in North Korea: it marks Kim's
first decade in power, the 80th anniversary of the birth of his father,
Kim Jong Il, and the 110th anniversary of the birth of his grandfather,
Kim Il Sung. The latter anniversary, on April 15, could prompt a major
weapons test in North Korea. It is highly plausible, even probable, that
North Korea is gearing up to test an ICBM or to launch a military
satellite utilizing the same missile technology, which is banned by UN
Security Council resolutions.

Even before the latest crisis, [[No]{.underline}]{.mark}rth
[[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}rea[['s]{.mark} [nuclear program was already in
overdrive.]{.mark}]{.underline} Since coming to power, [Kim has
conducted four nuclear tests and more than 130 missile tests. Pyongyang
is estimated to have up to 60 nuclear warheads and is producing enough
fissile material to make half a dozen new bombs annually. Kim is now
moving to place multiple warheads on a single ICBM. This]{.underline}
capability, [using]{.underline} what is known as [a multiple independent
reentry vehicle, would likely stymie limited U.S. missile
defenses]{.underline} [and enhance North Korea's ability to strike the
U.S. mainland with nuclear missiles]{.underline}---making North Korea
one of just three countries in the world able to do so, along with China
and Russia.

#### Invoking Article V for a cyber-attack [ensures]{.underline} NATO [vulnerabilities]{.underline} that Russia will [exploit]{.underline}

//nt-sg

This equivocation is not surprising, for several reasons. [The nature of
cyberspace]{.underline} often [**confounds** unequivocal deterrence
declarations. States]{.underline} tend to [operate in cyberspace with
**plausible deniability**]{.underline}, [which can make it difficult to
rapidly ascertain responsibility for cyber incidents]{.underline}. Also,
it can be [challenging to understand the **intent** behind observed
cyber behavior, and there is often a **substantial time lag** between
when an initial penetration of a network occurs and when the target even
realizes the breach. And the vast majority of cyber operations cause
**virtual, not physical, damage**, complicating efforts to assess and
evaluate the implications of the costs inflicted.]{.underline}
Moreover[, it can take time to develop and identify a way to infiltrate
a network as well as the computer code that takes advantage of a
vulnerability for malicious ends. This means states may **lack a
palatable cyber response** option for retaliatory purposes at the
desired time.]{.underline}

[This creates a **slew of**]{.underline} practical [**problems** if
Article 5 were to be invoked for a cyberattack]{.underline}. From an
implementation perspective, [it would trigger deliberations within the
North Atlantic Council]{.underline}, NATO's primary decision-making
body. [Decisions made within the NAC require **unanimity**, which can be
difficult to achieve for many issues but is especially **burdensome**
for cyber ones, given all of the ambiguities]{.underline} outlined
above[. The most likely outcome of this process would be a]{.underline}
long, drawn-out deliberation resulting in a [**divided alliance** unable
to agree on how or whether to respond]{.underline}. Quite simply, [some
allies are unlikely to want to risk World War III for a cyberattack that
disrupts the financial infrastructure, for instance, of another country
but doesn't lead to loss of life or sustained damage.]{.underline}

[These challenges have major **strategic implications** for
NATO.]{.underline} After years of publicly and repeatedly [linking
Article 5 to cyberspace]{.underline} and reinforcing that policy in
response to the Ukraine conflict, [a failure to achieve consensus and
respond to a Russian cyberattack against a NATO member could **imperil
Article 5** in other areas.]{.underline} [The disunity that is likely to
be revealed during NAC deliberations would then undermine the broader
political cohesion]{.underline} that has, for the most part, been
remarkably strong throughout the war in Ukraine. [This would make it
more **difficult for the alliance to respond** to other forms of Russian
behavior.]{.underline} As Biden emphasized at a press conference last
month, ["the single-most important thing is for us to stay unified ...
We have to stay fully, totally, thoroughly unified]{.underline}."

#### Russia will gradually push red-lines -- that goes nuclear

**Kulesa '18** \[Lukasz; February 2018; Research Director at the
European Leadership Network; European Leadership Network, "Envisioning a
Russia-NATO Conflict: Implications for Deterrence Stability,"
<http://www.jstor.com/stable/resrep17437>\]

Escalation: Can a NATO - Russia conflict be managed?

[[Once]{.mark} a [conflict was **under way**, the "**fog of war**"
and]{.mark} **rising [unpredictability]{.mark}** [would **inevitably**
set]{.mark} in, **complicating** the implementation of any]{.underline}
predetermined theories of escalation, deescalation and inter-[conflict
management. The **actual** dynamics of]{.underline} a
[conflict]{.underline} and the perceptions of the stakes involved [are
**extremely difficult** to predict. Simulations]{.underline} and
table-top exercises can [give]{.underline} only [limited
insights]{.underline} into the actual decision-making processes and
interactions.

Still, [[Russian]{.mark} military [theorists]{.mark}]{.underline} and
practitioners seem to **[[assume]{.underline}]{.mark}** that [a
[conflict]{.mark} with NATO [can be]{.mark} **managed** and
**[controlled]{.mark}** in a way that would bring it to a **swift end**
consistent with Russian aims. The [Russian **theory**]{.mark} **of
victory**]{.underline} would [seek to [**exploit weak points**
in]{.mark} an [Alliance]{.mark} war effort. Based on the **conviction**
that democracies are weak and]{.underline} their leaders and populations
are [risk-averse, [Russia]{.mark} may **[assume]{.mark}**
that]{.underline} its [[threats of]{.mark} **horizontal** or **vertical
[escalation]{.mark}** [could be]{.mark}]{.underline} particularly
[[effective. It would]{.underline}]{.mark} also [try to bring home the
notion]{.underline} that [it has **much higher stakes** in the
conflict]{.underline} (regime survival) [than]{.underline} a majority of
the [NATO members]{.underline} involved, [and]{.underline} thus [will be
ready to **[push]{.mark} the [boundaries]{.mark}** of]{.underline} the
[conflict further. It would]{.underline} most likely [[try to]{.mark}
**test** and **[exploit]{.mark}** potential **[divisions]{.mark}**
within the Alliance, combining **selective diplomacy** and
**activation** of its intelligence assets in]{.underline} some [NATO
states]{.underline} with a degree of selectivity in terms of targets of
particular attacks.

[**[Any]{.mark}** NATO-Russia [conflict would]{.mark} **inevitably**
[have a **nuc**]{.mark}**lear [dimension]{.mark}**. The role of
**nuclear weapons** as a tool [for **escalation control**]{.mark} for
Russia has been]{.underline} thoroughly [debated by experts, but
when]{.underline} and how [Russia might use]{.underline} (and not merely
showcase or activate) [nuclear weapons in a conflict remains an **open
question**. Beyond]{.underline} catch phrases such as ["**escalate to
de-escalate**"]{.underline} or "escalate to win" [[there are a]{.mark}
**wider [range]{.mark}** [of options for Russian]{.mark} **nuclear
weapon [use]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For example, [[a single
**nuclear**]{.mark} **warning [shot]{.mark}** [could be lethal]{.mark}
or non-lethal. It could be directed against a]{.underline} purely
[military target or a]{.underline} military-[civilian one. [Detonation
could be]{.mark} configured for an [**EMP effect**. A "**false
flag**"]{.mark} attack is]{.underline} also [conceivable. These
options]{.underline} might be used to [**signal escalation** and could
**significantly [complicate]{.mark}** NATO's
[responses]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Neither NATO nor its member states have developed a similar theory of
victory. Public NATO documents stipulate the general goals for the
Alliance: defend against any armed attack and, as needed, restore the
full sovereignty and territorial integrity of member states. [It is less
clear how far the Alliance would be **willing to escalate** the
conflict]{.underline} to achieve these goals, [and what
mechanisms]{.underline} and means [it would use while trying to
maintain]{.underline} some degree of [control]{.underline} over the
conflict.

[The goals]{.underline} and methods [of waging a [conflict]{.mark} with
Russia [would]{.mark}]{.underline} probably [[have to be limited]{.mark}
in order [to avoid]{.mark} a **massive [nuclear exchang]{.mark}e**. Such
limitations]{.underline} would also involve restrictions on striking
back against targets on Russian territory. But too narrow an approach
[could put **too much restraint** on NATO's operations: the Russian
**regime's stability** may]{.underline} ultimately [need to be
threatened]{.underline} in order [to **force the leadership** into
**terminating** the conflict]{.underline}. NATO would thus need to
establish what a proportional self-defence response to Russian actions
would involve, and to what extent cyber operations or attacks against
military targets in quite different parts of Russia would be useful as
tools of escalation to signal NATO's resolve. Moreover, individual NATO
Allies, especially those directly affected by Russia's actions, might
pursue their individual strategies of escalation.

With regards to the nuclear dimension in NATO escalation plans, given
the stakes involved, this element would most likely be handled by the
three nuclear-weapon members of the Alliance, with the US taking the
lead. The existence of three independent centres of nuclear
decision-making could be exploited to complicate Russian planning and
introduce uncertainty into the Russian strategic calculus, but some
degree of "P3" dialogue and coordination would be beneficial. This
coordination would not necessarily focus on nuclear targeting, but
rather on designing coordinated operations to demonstrate resolve in
order to keep the conflict below the nuclear threshold, or bring it back
under the threshold after first use.

[[Relying on]{.mark} concepts of **[escalation
control]{.mark}**]{.underline} and on lessons [from the Cold
War]{.underline} confrontation [[might be **misleading**]{.mark}. The
circumstances in which a [**Russia-NATO conflict** would]{.mark} play
out would [be]{.mark} **radically different** from the 20th
century]{.underline} screenplay. Moreover, [instead of
**gradual**]{.underline} (linear) [escalation or **salami tactics**
escalation, it is possible to imagine]{.underline} surprizing [["**leap
frog**" escalation]{.underline}]{.mark}, possibly
[connected]{.underline} with actions [in **different
domains**]{.underline} (e.g. a cyberattack against critical
infrastructure). Flexibility, good intelligence and inventiveness in
responding to such developments would be crucial.

Conflict termination

[Russian and NATO assumptions regarding conflict termination
would]{.underline} most likely [**not survive** the **first hours**
of]{.underline} an [actual conflict. [Both sides]{.mark} are capable of
**[underestimat]{.mark}ing** the **[resolve]{.mark}** of the other side
to prevail]{.underline} in a conflict [and the other side's
**willingness** to]{.underline} commit the necessary resources and
[endure the costs, especially once both]{.underline} sides [start
committing]{.underline} their [political capital]{.underline} and
resources and the casualties accumulate.

#### If Article V was invoked - the US would have [no choice]{.underline} but to retaliate with OCOs

**Healey 22** -- Senior Research Scholar at Columbia University\'s
School for International and Public Affairs specializing in cyber
conflict (Jason, "Preventing Cyber Escalation in Ukraine and After," War
on the Rocks, 3-9-22,
<https://warontherocks.com/2022/03/preventing-cyber-escalation-in-ukraine-and-after/>)
//nt-sg

First, [Russian offensive cyber operations might **spark a wider
war**]{.underline}. President Vladimir Putin has declared sanctions "are
akin to a declaration of war" and may see aggressive cyber attacks as
the perfect response, particularly since they are reversible and
non-lethal. Russia has been entangled with Western economies for
decades, especially in the realms of energy and finance. But now, as
ties are being severed quickly and viciously, Russia no longer has to
fear the backlash if its cyber forces were to disrupt Western banks or
liquified natural gas terminals. If you are dealt out of the game, why
not just flip the table?

Russia's cyber generals may be just as enthusiastic as their Army
counterparts. They may assure Putin their forces are ready for battle
and can quickly and bloodlessly get the West to back down. Putin could
be convinced disruptive attacks against the West are no big deal, a
low-cost signal that the West should de-escalate or just the next
natural move in a non-escalatory intelligence contest. After all, U.S.
research found that in response to cyber attacks, "Americans are less
likely to support retaliation with force" compared to a more traditional
strike.

This can lead to escalation in two ways. [The United States --- along
with countries like the United Kingdom, France, and the Netherlands ---
might well decide to **defend forward against such attacks**. Gen. Paul
Nakasone, the commander of U.S. Cyber Command, has **insisted** his
forces "must take this fight to the enemy, just as we do in other
aspects of conflict." His then-deputy has also argued that the United
States **"cannot cede any territory"** to adversaries as the "Russians
will keep pushing until we push back on them."]{.underline}

Worse, [Dmitri Alperovitch recently warned that if Russia launches cyber
attacks after "\[h\]aving already **exhausted the power of economic
sanctions**, America and its European allies would have **few choices**
other than to respond to these attacks with offensive cyber-strikes of
their own." Such dynamics can feed a **spiraling escalation in
cyberspace** that might take on a life outside of the control of
policymakers]{.underline}.

#### Retal [triggers]{.underline} tit-for-tat cyber escalation -- nuclear war

**Klare '19** \[Michael; November 19; Professor Emeritus of Peace and
World Security Studies at Hampshire College, Senior Visiting Fellow at
the Arms Control Association; Arms Control Today, "Cyber Battles,
Nuclear Outcomes? Dangerous New Pathways to Escalation"
<https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2019-11/features/cyber-battles-nuclear-outcomes-dangerous-new-pathways-escalation>\]

Yet [another pathway to **[escalation]{.mark}** could [arise
from]{.mark} a **[cascading]{.mark} series** of
**[cyberstrikes]{.mark}**]{.underline} and counterstrikes
[[against]{.mark} vital **national
[infrastructure]{.mark}**]{.underline} rather than on military targets.
[[All]{.mark} **major [powers]{.mark}**[, along with **Iran**
and]{.mark} **North [Korea]{.mark}**]{.underline}, have developed and
[[deployed]{.mark} cyber[weapons]{.mark}]{.underline} designed
[to]{.underline} disrupt and [destroy]{.underline} major elements of [an
adversary's]{.underline} key economic systems, such as [power
grids]{.underline}, financial systems, and transportation networks. As
noted, Russia has infiltrated the U.S. electrical grid, and it is widely
believed that the United States has done the same in
Russia.[12](https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2019-11/features/cyber-battles-nuclear-outcomes-dangerous-new-pathways-escalation#endnote12) The
Pentagon has also devised a plan known as "Nitro Zeus," intended to
immobilize the entire Iranian economy and so force it to capitulate to
U.S. demands or, if that approach failed, to pave the way for a
crippling air and missile
attack.[13](https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2019-11/features/cyber-battles-nuclear-outcomes-dangerous-new-pathways-escalation#endnote12)

[The danger]{.underline} here [is that **economic
[attacks]{.mark}**]{.underline} of this sort, [if]{.underline}
undertaken [during a period of tension]{.underline} and crisis, [could
[lead to]{.mark} an **[escalating]{.mark}** series of
**[tit-for-tat]{.mark} attacks** [against]{.mark}]{.underline} ever
[more [vital]{.mark} elements of an adversary's **critical
[infrastructure]{.mark}**, producing widespread chaos]{.underline} and
harm [and]{.underline} eventually [[leading]{.mark} one side [to]{.mark}
initiate **[kinetic attacks]{.mark}** on critical military targets,
[risking]{.mark} the **slippery slope** to **[nuc]{.mark}lear
[conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For example, [a **[Russian]{.mark}**
cyber[attack]{.mark} on the]{.underline} U.S. [power grid could trigger
**U.S. attacks** on Russian **energy**]{.underline} and financial
systems, causing widespread disorder in both countries and generating an
impulse for even more devastating attacks. At some point, such
[attacks]{.underline} "could [[lead to]{.mark} major conflict
and]{.underline} possibly [**[nuc]{.mark}lear
[war]{.mark}**[."]{.mark}]{.underline}[14](https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2019-11/features/cyber-battles-nuclear-outcomes-dangerous-new-pathways-escalation#endnote14)

These are by no means the only pathways to escalation resulting from the
offensive use of cyberweapons. [Others include]{.underline} efforts by
[third parties, such as **[proxy]{.mark} states** [or
**terrorist**]{.mark} organization**[s]{.mark}**, to [provoke a
**global**]{.mark} **nuclear [crisis]{.mark}** [by causing]{.mark}
**early-warning** systems to generate **[false
readings]{.mark}**]{.underline} ("spoofing") [[of missile]{.mark}
launche[s]{.mark}]{.underline}. Yet, they do provide a clear indication
of the severity of the threat. [As states' reliance on **cyberspace**
grows]{.underline} and cyberweapons become more powerful, [the [dangers
of]{.mark}]{.underline} unintended or **[[accident]{.mark}al
escalation]{.underline}** can only [[grow]{.underline}]{.mark} more
[severe]{.underline}.

### Solvency\-\--1AC

#### [Internal clarification]{.underline} of Article 5 commitments is key\-\--closes gaps between [expectations]{.underline} and [capabilities]{.underline} and gives member states a [collective framework]{.underline} for [understanding]{.underline} and [countering]{.underline} threats via [coalitions of the willing]{.underline}

**Ucko '10** \[David; October 26; Professor and Director of the
Combating Terrorism Fellowship Program in the College of International
Security Affairs at the National Defense University; World Politics
Review, "Resetting Article 5: Toward a New Understanding of NATO\'s
Security Guarantees,"
<https://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/6838/resetting-article-5-toward-a-new-understanding-of-natos-security-guarantees>\]

For all this, [the [alliance]{.mark} badly [needs]{.mark} a
[**clarification** of]{.mark} its [collective security
mech]{.mark}anism, for, though its current **[ambiguity may fool]{.mark}
prospective [adversaries, it]{.mark} really [should not fool NATO
itself]{.mark}.** There is a need]{.underline}, in other words, [to
chart a **middle path** between traditionalists and revolutionaries,
whereby NATO **maintains a solidarity** clause but comes to a new,
**narrower** and shared understanding of its meaning and implications.
The point would be to [downgrade]{.mark} the [expectations]{.mark} that
come with NATO membership [by **talking more honestly**]{.mark},
**[within NATO]{.mark}**, [about what the alliance is]{.mark}
[**likely** and **able** to commit to.]{.mark}]{.underline}

First, [it would be necessary to convey, **in private**, to members that
**an Article 5 response** is not automatic, but is rather the product of
intensely **political processes** within each NATO state, and that even
if a response is forthcoming, there is no way of guaranteeing that it
will be timely or particularly effective. The language of an
**unflinching**, **immediate**, collective and effective response may be
appropriate for **audiences outside of NATO**, but not for **internal
discussion.** Within the alliance, **[less grandstanding]{.mark}
rhetoric** [and **greater transparency** would]{.mark} [reduce]{.mark}
the scope for [**obfuscation**. The **language of collective security**
would **remain**]{.mark} \-- for symbolic reasons, **[for the deterrent
role]{.mark}** that Article 5 still plays and for the foundation it
provides for retaliatory action. But the point would be to
**re-emphasize** within the alliance the oft-forgotten provision of
Article 5 whereby each member takes only **\"such action as it deems
necessary\"** when fulfilling its security obligations.]{.underline}

Second, [[NATO would]{.mark} need to **[delineate]{.mark}** much more
clearly [**what types of threats** it is capable of countering]{.mark}.
No doubt [a **nontraditional attack** can be]{.mark} as
[devastating]{.mark} as a military strike, but it does not follow that
NATO is equally prepared to handle both. The decision regarding NATO\'s
role in any incident must be based not only on the severity of a
potential attack, but also on **NATO\'s ability** to mount an effective
response.]{.underline} Whereas the language of solidarity following the
Sept. 11 attacks was certainly appropriate, a case can be made that NATO
ultimately overextended itself in invoking Article 5. The invocation
established a dangerous precedent for the kinds of threats that the
article might cover, many of which NATO lacks the expertise to deter, to
forestall or to counter. [[Talking loudly]{.mark} about collective
defense against non-traditional attacks **[without]{.mark} a concomitant
[ability to deliver]{.mark}** when they occur [is likely to provoke a
**crisis of credibility**]{.mark} for the alliance.]{.underline}

[Similar [**gaps between expectations and capabilities**
surround]{.mark} the issue of **[cybersecurity]{.mark}**]{.underline},
which Secretary-General Rasmussen recently suggested should be covered
by Article 5, as well as [**energy-security threats** and **economic
warfare**: NATO undoubtedly has a role to play in protecting its members
from these potentially very harmful forms of attack, yet until the
capability is created, it may want to **interpret** its **security
guarantees** more **narrowly**. This also raises the question of [how
serious an attack in a **nontraditional domain**]{.mark} [would need to
be to **trigger Article 5**]{.mark} considerations. Some informal
[**criteria** would]{.mark} need to [be agreed upon]{.mark} to inform
expectation, yet clearly this is also something that would need to be
settled [**behind closed doors**,]{.mark} so as not to invite attack and
provocation **under the established threshold** or precisely where
NATO\'s guarantees are the weakest.]{.underline}

Naturally, the prospect of agreeing within NATO to a more honest but
weaker Article 5 regime will elicit much support among those who rely
most on NATO\'s security guarantees. Nonetheless, [**greater
[transparency is preferable to false hope]{.mark}**. A hardnosed
**stocktaking** of what NATO can and cannot do would also provide for a
more promising foundation on which progress could be made: a **common
appraisal** of problems faced and a **framework for finding limited
solutions**, where possible. This would also [allow]{.mark} those
[nations that feel]{.mark} most [vulnerable to **make their own security
arrangements**]{.mark}, even if that means seeking relationships outside
the alliance structure]{.underline}. In the event that such arrangements
are inimical to NATO\'s interests, the onus would then be on the
alliance itself to provide a preferable alternative. In that sense,
[**greater transparency** would make the self-interest of individual
members the foundation of NATO\'s collective defense mechanism, rather
than the need to ensure the alliance\'s solidarity or prove its
relevance, the reasons most often used to justify Article 5 security
guarantees today but whose rhetorical appeal rarely translates into
action.]{.underline}

### Solvency\-\--Imminence\-\--1AC

#### Limiting Article 5 to be bound by imminence creates a threshold that is non-escalatory

Defensive to Offensive" Posted on January 12, 2018 by Elizabeth Dominic.

To keep pace with the rapidly developing landscape of military
technologies, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is
reportedly changing its approach to cyber warfare. NATO, a primarily
defensive alliance so far, is considering the adoption of offensive
cyber warfare strategies to confront hacking attacks from its opponents.
Member states including United States, Germany, Spain, Britain,
Netherlands, and Norway are already actively developing offensive cyber
warfare strategies and are hoping to solidify their agreement by 2019.
The agreement would enable the alliance to combat cyber attacks that
undermine governments and steal their intelligence information and
military technologies.\[1\] This post will briefly examine the prospect
of NATO adopting the proposed offensive cyber warfare strategy within
the current framework of international law.

NATO's Current Cyber Strategy

At present, NATO has a strong cyber defense policy in place. It aims to
protect its own networks, and provides assistance to its members to
develop their own cyber defense capabilities.\[2\] Following the denial
of service (DoS) attacks against Estonia, NATO adopted a new cyber
defense policy at the 2008 Bucharest Summit, which then led to the
establishment of the Cyber Defense Management Authority. It was
subsequently replaced with Cyber Defence Management Board, which is the
nodal agency responsible for "technical, political, and information
sharing between allies" and for directing and coordinating between
existing cyber defence entities.\[3\]

In the following years, NATO made substantive progress towards
integrating cyber defense into its exercises. [[At]{.underline}]{.mark}
the [[**2014 Wales summit**, cyber]{.underline}]{.mark} defense [[was
established as]{.mark} an integral component of NATO's core mission of
collective defense, **[triggering]{.mark}** the application of
collective defense under [Article 5]{.mark} of the NATO Treaty. [Under
Article 5, **all** member states **are required**]{.mark} to come
together [to aid a]{.mark} member [state]{.mark} if it is [subjected
to]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}an [[armed attack]{.underline}]{.mark}.
With the adoption of the cyber defence policy, [an armed attack was
defined to]{.underline} also [include a cyber attack]{.underline}.
However [the [**threshold**]{.mark} that is [to be
satisfied]{.mark}]{.underline} by the cyber attack to trigger collective
defense **[[was not disclosed]{.underline}]{.mark}** so that it would
remain as a deterrent for potential attackers.\[4\] This was followed by
an official recognition of cyber [as a domain of warfare in
2016.]{.underline}

Should NATO Adopt An Offensive Cyber Warfare Strategy?

The cyber threat landscape is rapidly undergoing dramatic changes; it is
becoming increasingly sophisticated and diverse. A war in cyber space is
not a distant possibility. In response to these current developments, it
might be appropriate for NATO to adopt a more proactive approach to
counter the threats posed by the proliferation of cyber weapons by its
adversaries and to ensure global security. An offensive cyber warfare
strategy, as considered by NATO could be a solution. Embedding offensive
cyber operations into NATO's military operations may serve as a
deterrent for potential attackers.\[5\]

However the use of [[offensive cyber]{.underline}]{.mark} strategies
[[should be governed by]{.underline}]{.mark} the principles of
[[i]{.underline}]{.mark}nternational [[law]{.underline}]{.mark}. Even
though the UN Charter prohibits the use of force, Article 51 of the
Charter recognizes the inherent right of states to act in self-defence.
Therefore an offensive cyber strategy should be employed only if it
amounts to an act of self-defence. In the cyber context, as per the
unanimous opinion of the Group of Experts that prepared the Tallinn
Manual, only cyber attacks with kinetic consequences are tantamount to
an armed attack, legitimizing the use of force in self-defence. There
are limited circumstances in which an act of offensive warfare can be
considered an act of self-defence, which is legitimate in international
law.

International Law and Offence as Defence

Currently, [there are two possible types of self-defence-
**anticipatory** and **pre-emptive**]{.underline}- that could be claimed
by a state if it exercises use of force against another prior to getting
attacked. However there is an ongoing debate on their legitimacy under
international law. Over the course of time, anticipatory self-defence
has gained international consensus with the support of significant state
practice\[6\] and is considered legitimate if an imminent threat of
attack clearly exists and the response is proportional to the
threat.\[7\] However [[pre-emptive self-defence involves]{.mark}
preventive [action]{.mark} by a state [against a **non-imminent
threat**]{.mark}, and is more controversial]{.underline}.

Even though the ICJ has in the past ruled a claim of
[[pre-emptive]{.mark} self-defence]{.underline} invalid in Democratic
Republic of the Congo v. Uganda stating that it is not in consonance
with the language of the UN Charter, the claim [[is]{.mark} being
**increasingly [reaffirmed]{.mark}** [by]{.mark} many countries
including]{.underline} Australia, UK, China and [[the
US]{.underline}]{.mark}.\[8\] But **[[if imminence is not a
pre-requisite, where do we draw the line]{.underline}]{.mark}** between
legitimate and illegitimate pre-emptive self-defence attacks? [The
[international community is **yet to establish**]{.mark} **a
[criteria]{.mark}** []{.mark}for determination]{.underline} of the same.

In light of the profound political consequences attached to an offensive
attack, [[**it is ideal for NATO to resort to offensive strategies only
if**]{.mark} either [**a member**]{.mark} state **[is subjected to cyber
attack]{.mark}** or **if there is an imminent threat**. [It
is]{.mark}]{.underline} also [[imperative]{.underline}]{.mark} that [the
[**response remains proportional**.]{.mark}]{.underline} However in case
of cyber attacks, [key [questions remain in relation to]{.mark} the
determination of]{.underline} [[**proportionality** and
**imminence**.]{.mark} This [confusion is exacerbated by the **uncertain
nature of law**]{.mark}]{.underline} in this field, with a lack of
consensus on even basic questions such as what amounts to a cyber
attack.

### Hybrid Threats Key\-\--1AC/2AC

#### Hybrid threats are the [only]{.underline} challenge Russia will pose to NATO\-\--threats to invoke article V [are not deterring]{.underline}

[Despite]{.underline} the [necessity of exercises like Defender
2020]{.underline}, new purchases of advanced military equipment and the
**[expansion]{.underline}** [of **military manpower** (]{.underline}all
underway since 2014), these steps together [constitute a **growing
paradox**]{.underline} [that the Alliance has been **slow to
recognise**]{.underline} and respond to. That is, [just as the Alliance
is becoming more **focused on** and]{.underline} more **[capable
of]{.underline}** **[responding]{.underline}** [to an **Article 5
threshold-crossing event**]{.underline}, [the **probability** of a
**conventional**]{.underline} [manoeuvre]{.underline} [warfare scenario
is **decreasing**]{.underline}. Put another way, [major improvements in
the Alliance's ability to defend the territory of its member states are
necessary, but it is becoming]{.underline} ever more [obvious that these
steps will **not be sufficient**]{.underline} [for **collective
defence** in NATO's next decade.]{.underline}

Many European security analysts believe [an **[Article 5
threshold-crossing event]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[is]{.underline}
**[unlikely]{.underline}**]{.mark} [in the coming years]{.underline}.
[[Russia is]{.mark} a **[declining]{.mark} state**]{.underline}
[along]{.underline} [**several measures,** especially in economic terms,
and over time the **acute threat**]{.underline} [that it represents
today should **diminish**]{.underline}. Certainly, it has made advances
recently in limited military capability areas, such as indirect fires
and precision munitions. Yet, the Russian playbook evidently continues
to **[eschew]{.underline}** **[frontal attacks]{.underline}** [on states
that are members of a military alliance, at least in the air, sea, land
and space domains.]{.underline}

[A frontal attack]{.underline} in one of these domains or some other
egregious assault [compelling NATO to invoke Article 5 **[would not play
to Russia's strengths]{.mark}**]{.underline} -- [instead, it
[would]{.mark} actually **expose** its many **weaknesses**]{.underline},
[ultimately [resulti]{.mark}ng [in **certain defeat**]{.mark}.
[Moscow's]{.mark} military and governing **[elites know
this]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [For this reason, the [Kremlin has]{.mark}
consistently [chosen to **emphasise**]{.mark} and]{.underline}
**[leverage]{.underline}** [[its **comparative
advantages**]{.underline}]{.mark} [to make effective use of its
clearly]{.underline} **[limited resources]{.underline}**. The [military
policy]{.underline} tools that facilitate this do not resemble armoured
columns crossing national frontiers. Rather, they
[[include]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[fomenting civil
unrest]{.underline}]{.mark}** with the goal of creating a justification
for Russian military or paramilitary action in unaligned, neighbouring
or near-neighbouring states, [as seen in Moldova (1992), Georgia (2008)
and Ukraine (2014).]{.underline} They [also include **[cyber
attacks]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [such as]{.underline} that unleashed on
[Estonia]{.underline} in 2007. They [include]{.underline} **[[influence
peddling]{.underline}]{.mark}** [and the cultivation of **[patronage
networks]{.mark}**. [And]{.mark}]{.underline} they include
[semi-deniable **[election interference]{.mark}**]{.underline}, as
occurred in the US in 2016 and 2018 and in Europe in recent years as
well. [All of these policy tools represent **asymmetric
responses**]{.underline} [to US and Western power]{.underline},
especially military capacity and capabilities. [They [enable Moscow to
**cost-effectively**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[pursue]{.mark} the
**[disintegration of]{.mark} Western power**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} [[the Western alliance]{.underline},]{.mark} as a way
of achieving Russia's strategic and material ends. Given the current
state of the Russian economy and the rather grim outlook for the years
to come, [Moscow is very likely to **continue pursuing** these sorts of
policies in the coming]{.underline} [decade, because it **[lacks other
options]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

[[The **fundamental challenge**]{.underline} [facing
NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} between now and the Alliance's 80th
anniversary [[is]{.mark} figuring out **how**]{.underline},
**[where]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[when]{.underline}** [it
will counter and compete iteratively with [Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}
-- but also China [-- [in the **grey zone**]{.mark}**,**]{.underline}
the space between war and peace, or between offense and defence.
[Because grey-zone challenges do not **neatly correspond** to classical
notions of those which fall in the military's domain and those which do
not, they are **particularly vexing**]{.underline}. This is why
adversaries such as Russia and China employ grey-zone tactics and
operations -- they allow Moscow and Beijing to confront the West on more
favourable terrain.

The good news is that [NATO's leaders appear to understand the character
of the competition]{.underline}, and have taken several steps to address
the challenge. The Alliance has reportedly developed a strategy
outlining NATO's role in responding to grey-zone or hybrid threats. In
some cases, grey-zone scenarios are finding their way into NATO and
member states' exercises. And critical infrastructure protection, energy
security and societal resilience have become important topics of
discussion at Alliance-sponsored events and seminars, and among
Alliance-affiliated entities such as centres of excellence.

[However, in several important aspects, the Alliance response
remains]{.underline} ~~handicapped~~ \[**[weak]{.underline}**\].
[Although [NATO declared]{.mark} in 2016 and again in 2018 that [it
could consider a **hybrid attack** as **grounds to invoke Article
5,**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[the bar seems]{.mark}
**[high]{.mark}**]{.underline} -- [perhaps]{.underline} **[impossibly
so.]{.underline}** [[Achieving **consensus**]{.underline}]{.mark} --
[and **[quickly]{.mark}** --]{.underline} **[[in the face of an]{.mark}
ambiguous [attack]{.mark}]{.underline}** [or in response to ostensibly
unrelated low-level provocations **[will not be]{.mark} an [easy]{.mark}
task**]{.underline}. Perhaps more importantly, [NATO remains in a
**defensive crouch** when it comes to grey-zone challenges]{.underline}
-- Alliance rhetoric, exercises and actions emphasise response and
reaction. [It is precisely for this reason that grey-zone challenges
against NATO are likely to be]{.underline} **[effective]{.underline}**
-- actors such as [[Russia]{.underline} [and China]{.underline} [are
**evidently** **undeterred**]{.underline}]{.mark} [by the
Alliance's]{.underline} defensive [posture]{.underline}, and attacks on
Western institutions continue to this day. To be clear, defence is
important, but in the current international security environment,
offense and the competitive actions in between the two are equally
important.

[Given the]{.underline} arguably **[inadequate]{.underline}** [Alliance
response to date]{.underline}, [some **guideposts**]{.underline} [may be
helpful to **illuminate the path ahead** as NATO attempts to ensure
collective defence remains robust into its eighth decade]{.underline}.
First, [**[Article 5]{.underline}** [is]{.underline}]{.mark} [an
**[imperfect]{.mark} tool**]{.underline} for determining when and where
the West must spend blood and treasure in defence of its interests and
way of life. [[Despite]{.mark} [Alliance **rhetoric**]{.mark} regarding
hybrid warfare as a potential Article 5 trigger, [the threshold]{.mark}
for]{.underline} [Alliance-wide [action is **too
high**]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [and]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[adversaries]{.mark} like Russia]{.underline} and China [**[know
it]{.underline}** -- [this is **why** they pursue]{.underline}
**[grey-zone tactics]{.underline}**]{.mark} [in the first
place]{.underline}. [To facilitate the **speedy response**]{.underline}
[that will be **necessary**]{.underline} [to meet the needs of Allied
defence against grey-zone challenges]{.underline},
[greater]{.underline}, routine [use can be made of **Article 4** and
Alliancewide **consultations**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[coordination]{.underline}** [on issues]{.underline} and topics [that
go **beyond** conventional military operations that are NATO's bread and
butte]{.underline}r. For instance, the Alliance can and should conduct
more vigorous, regular consultations and intensified coordination on
topics such as keeping Chinese investment out of sensitive
information-technology and logistics sectors, limiting and rolling back
Russian broadcast and print media penetration of Western markets,
undermining the Kremlin's and Putin's trustworthiness within Russia, and
exposing Russian and Chinese official corruption at home and abroad, all
as mechanisms to compete and thereby strengthen collective defence.

#### Unchecked Russian probes cause global war and instability

The Dynamics of Change

The West sees in Russia a heuristic image of itself, when in fact
[Russia has broken out of the traditional hermeneutics of European
international relations.]{.underline} The starkest manifestation of this
is the intensification of the continuing "pivot to the East", and in
particular the close alignment with China accompanied by the
[strengthening]{.underline} of [a "post-Western" world order
encompassing such bodies as the SCO and BRICS, the heart of]{.underline}
what is emerging as [an anti-hegemonic alignment. Even Europe is shaken
by the new dynamic of change, undermining the stasis in its
affairs]{.underline}. The Atlantic enlargement strategy did not
represent the resolution of the European security dilemma but the
intensification of that problem. Relations between Russia and Europe,
and with the West more generally, entered a deep impasse. The resolution
of the problem it appeared could not be found from within the
hermeneutics of the system itself, in which the liberal international
order is faced by a number of rising powers loosely aligned in an
anti-hegemonic bloc. [There is a clash of orders]{.underline}, but at
the same time [some profound changes are taking place in international
relations]{.underline}. In the framework of my two-level model of the
international system, there are [changes in the vertical
axis]{.underline}--- relations between states and orders and [the
institutions of global governance]{.underline}, above all the UN; [and
at the horizontal level, where [the]{.mark} universalistic [ambitions of
the l]{.mark}iberal [i]{.mark}nternational [o]{.mark}rder [are
challenged by]{.mark} the emergence of [the anti-hegemonic
alignment]{.mark}]{.underline} as well as by non-systemic forces that
seek to destroy the entirety of the international system to create, in
particular, a new militant form of the Islamic ummah.

[The clash between [Russia]{.mark} and the West [is]{.mark}]{.underline}
only [an early version]{.underline}, and ultimately perhaps not the most
significant, [of the challenges now [challenging the long-term stasis in
international affairs]{.mark}. International relations are now being
reshaped]{.underline}, above all by the putative defection of the US
from the core of the liberal international order that it has so
assiduously developed over the last 70 years. Many of the themes sounded
by Trump were advanced in one form or another by American leaders before
him, but none with such intensity or generated by ideas that are so
fundamentally at odds with the multilateral normative Atlanticism that
took shape after 1945. Trump is the consummate national realist, having
little respect for international institutions or multilateral processes.
By contrast, Russia's continuing commitment to international society as
expressed in the UN and other "secondary institutions" means that Putin
is a "conservative institutionalist", defending international law and
the traditional rules of global governance (the intervention in Ukraine
in 2014 was a revisionist act, but not part of a revisionist strategy).
By contrast, after 1989 "democratic institutionalists" sought to use
international society to "remedy drawbacks of traditional international
law and develop new institutions by using the rule of the majority in
roughly the same way it works in domestic politics" (Sokov 2018). There
has long been a national realist strain in US foreign policy, and it was
this tendency which defeated Woodrow Wilson's attempts to create a
multilateral world order in the wake of the First World War, and which
kept the US out of the League of Nations. Although Putin's policy is
pragmatic and broadly realist, it is not realist in the strict
definition of the term because of its willingness to share sovereignty
with international institutions (notably the UN, Council of Europe and
World Trade Organization), irrespective of its chequered relations with
these bodies.

At the same time, Russia challenges the attempt by democracy promotion
activists and others to extend the scope of global governance bodies to
disrupt the balance between sharing and maintaining sovereignty. The
Responsibility to Protect (R2P) mechanism adopted in 2005 alarmed Russia
and other states who considered it as an unwonted increase in the power
of an international community dominated by the hegemonic powers,
although in practice Russia engaged with R2P, despite the conservatism
of its institutionalism (Averre and Davies 2015). In the inter--Cold War
years, the main tension between Russia and the US was between the two
forms of institutionalism, although both camps evolved under different
leaders. Even though Putin pursued a "new realist" policy, this
represented an attempt to find some mode of integration and
reconciliation with the democratic institutionalist agenda, but in the
end this was doomed to fail. Nevertheless, even as neo-revisionism came
to predominate in Russian foreign policy, this did not make Putin a
realist of the old school. It is for this reason "any cooperation
between them \[Putin and Trump\] can only be temporary and tactical".
For Trump power is the key asset, deployed as finite asset, in a context
where the balance of power is perceived to be moving away from the US
(Sokov 2018). Hence Trump insists that allies contribute more to their
own defence, a long-term stance of US leaders but now couched in terms
of a transactional relationship rather than the traditional common
commitment to multilateral institutions. It is in this light that Trump
while campaigning in 2016 argued that NATO was "obsolete", and in power
he made little effort to hide his distaste for the EU. He appeared to
make NATO's Article 5 security guarantee dependent on whether a state
met the 2 per cent defence spending target set in Wales in September
2014. This represents a shift from collective to transactional defence,
where security guarantees apply only if the appropriate contribution has
been made.

Trump's approach to Russia is in line with his national realist view of
international relations. He consistently stressed the importance of good
relations with Russia (provoking the fears of the defenders of the
traditional order in Washington), and pushed for the Helsinki summit
with Putin in July 2018. However, this did not prevent him from taking
numerous measures against Russia, including the sale of lethal arms to
Ukraine, ramping up funding for the European Reassurance Initiative and
reinforcing the US troop presence in Europe, condemning the building of
Nord Stream 2 as making Germany subservient to Russia, imposing harsh
sanctions, expelling Russian diplomats and closing down Russian
diplomatic facilities in the US. His overall strategy was in the Henry
Kissinger mode (and he appears to have been advised by Kissinger),
namely to try to recruit Russia to align with the US against what was
perceived as the greatest long-term threat, China. In practice, the sum
of US actions only reinforced the Russo-Chinese alignment, and there was
zero chance of Russia defecting. At the best of times, the two countries
saw the US as an unreliable protagonist, and although there are plenty
of voices in Moscow warning of the dangers of a too-close embrace with
China, their alignment is far more than one built on the truly
extraordinary relationship between Putin and Xi Jinping. The two share
not only a strong personal relationship but also the conservative
institutionalist position. Thus Russia condemned Trump's withdrawal from
the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA, Iran nuclear deal) in May
2018 while emphasizing the crucial role of the UN, while China emerged
as the great defender of open markets and global economic governance.

The struggle for recognition as an equal in the management of
international affairs is now a more credible proposition, as evidenced
in Russia's remarkably effective intervention in Syria from September
2015 (even though the end game of the Syrian civil war may entail
intensified great power conflict). At the tenth BRICS summit, held in
South Africa in July 2018, Putin noted that the group had developed into
"a full-scale organization with new spheres of activity and broader
common interests". The main topics discussed were "resistance to
unilateral approaches in global affairs, the protection of
multilateralism", and the condemnation of economic sanctions and the use
of force in violation of the UN Charter (Kremlin.ru 2018). BRICS
established its New Development Bank in July 2014, based in Shanghai but
with plans to open regional branches in all the BRICS members. At that
time the BRICS accounted for 26.5 per cent of the world's land area,
42.6 per cent of world population, and according to the IMF in 2015
generated almost a quarter of the world's GDP and contributed more than
half of global economic growth in the previous decade (RT 2018). George
Toloraya (2018), executive director of the Russian National Committee on
BRICS research, argued that "BRICS is about world order", creating its
own structure of global governance "to create a world order that will be
more just and balanced than what we see now".

[Russia and China are not the harbingers of a new nationalism but of a
new internationalism.]{.underline} Both insist on the equal status of
all countries under international law. Under the flag of this principle,
[they contested the slide towards democratic majoritarian rule in
international politics]{.underline}, and thus opposed humanitarian
intervention unless sanctioned by the UN Security Council. They [opposed
attempts by the West to impose rules through majority
decisions]{.underline} or the use of multilateral institutions for
political purposes. This was the case when in July 2018 the majority of
members of the Organization for the Prevention of Chemical Weapons
(OPCW) voted on the right to draw on outside expertise to assign
responsibility for the use of chemical weapons, which Russia argued gave
it a political role that it feared could be used by the West to pursue
broader unrelated political objectives. Moscow's concern at the
perceived politicization of the organization opened up the possibility
that Russia could even leave the Chemical Weapons Convention.

Overall, [if the twentieth century was the century of ideology, then the
twenty-first in its Trumpian version is beginning to look rather more
like the nineteenth, that is, nationalistic and
mercantilist]{.underline}. For the commentators who in 2014 condemned
Russia's actions in Ukraine as a throwback to the nineteenth century,
this would confirm a natural convergence between Putinite Russia and
Trumpian America. However, this would be wrong for the reasons outlined
earlier. Paradoxically, [it is now Russia and China that are defending
multilateralism and the governance institutions of international
society. Both defend the traditional view of state sovereignty, but as
noted this does not represent a simple reversion to Westphalian
internationalism. Their conservative institutionalism is ranged as much
against the Trumpian sovereignty discourse as it is against the
expansive interventionism of the democratic
institutionalists.]{.underline}

One of the more striking manifestations of the shift from stasis to
change is that [the very concept of "the West" is being
challenged]{.underline}. It is not that Russia is looking to the East to
build alliances with other illiberal states, the way that recent
developments are categorized by defenders of the old liberal hegemony,
but [an expression of the changing realities of global politics. The
West is no longer the centre of the world in economic and even normative
terms]{.underline}. Values of good governance, defensible property
rights, rule of law, free and fair elections remain embedded as the core
values of international society, although tempered by developmental and
security considerations in countries like Russia and China. In fact, if
decoupled from the Western power system and its inexorably hegemonic
demands, there is a greater chance for them to be achieved. NATO
enlargement effectively militarized the democracy promotion efforts of
the West, while unmediated EU enlargement and power projection into the
contested "common neighbourhood" reinforced the view of critics in
Moscow that "democratic institutionalism" represented a fundamental
threat to Russia's security and national interests (Hahn 2018).

Not surprisingly, [some Russian analysts take great glee in describing
the travails of the disintegrating West]{.underline}. In their view,
Trump's policy called into question the common interests and common
values of some of the fundamental institutions of the old order. The G7
summit in Taormina, Italy, in May 2017 was considered a failure, while
the one in La Malbaie, Canada, in June 2018 proved a veritable disaster.
[[Trump's]{.mark} application of [the transactional]{.mark} business
[model to his]{.mark} [allies]{.mark} [raised the question of whether
the West would survive]{.mark} in its traditional form at all. This
would [provide an opportunity for the anti-hegemonic alignment to assume
a greater share of the burden of global leadership]{.mark}, but only if
the end of stasis in international affairs was accompanied by the
positive transcendence of immobilism.]{.underline} However, [just as
after the end of the First Cold War, [a negative transcendence is
possible,]{.mark} [intensifying]{.mark} the [conflicts]{.mark} and
[deepening the Second Cold War.]{.mark}]{.underline} The inertia
associated with the post-war stasis has deep roots, but its unravelling
can have both positive and negative outcomes.

Conclusion

Is an alternative possible? Some years ago Andrew Hurrell (2006, 1)
noted that the four BRIC countries had a certain "capacity to contribute
to the production of international order, regionally or globally". At
that time Russia was considered the outlier, since "the reality of the
past two decades here has been one of decline and the dissolution of
power" (Hurrell 2006, 2; MacFarlane 2006). Hurrell (2006, 2) noted that
while a central theme of the twentieth century was the struggle of
revisionist states to achieve equal rights, "the recognition of regional
spheres of influence, and the drive for equality of status within formal
and informal international institutions", and although in the recent
period "the currency of power" may have changed, the issue of
recognition "has been sharpened by the growth of the idea that
international society should aim to promote shared values and purposes
rather than simply underpin coexistence and help to keep conflict to a
minimum". [In the second decade of the twenty-first century, Russia
re-emerged as an active player in international affairs]{.underline},
and although still only barely in the top dozen countries economically,
[its impressive military reform and re-equipment since the 2008
Russo-Georgian war allowed it to "punch above its weight".]{.underline}
Stasis and change now balance each other, and [although the post-First
Cold War order is unravelling, this has given rise to both a Second Cold
War and the emergence of an antihegemonic alignment. The question today
is whether the latter can help transcend the former.]{.underline}

[Although the sinews of a post-Western world are emerging, notably in
the form of SCO and BRICS, it remains to be seen whether these bodies

#### Eliminating unsustainable and unenforceable alliance commitments doesn't signal unreliability

Brad L. **LeVeck and** Neil **Narang 16**, associate professor of
political science at the University of California Merced, associate

Security Hub at the University of California Santa Barbara 2016, How
International Reputation Matters: Revisiting Alliance Violations in
Context,
https://faculty.ucmerced.edu/bleveck/assets/pdfs/how_international_reputation_matters.pdf

In this context, a particularly good indicator of future alliance
behavior may be past behavior. If a state violated its agreements in the
past, it seems intuitive that it may be more likely to do so in the
future. [However]{.underline}, Spence (1973) famously showed that [[past
behavior is not always]{.mark} equally [informative]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} that whether [past behavior]{.underline}
distinguishes one type from another **[[depends]{.underline}]{.mark}**
crucially [**[on the behavior's cost]{.underline}**.
**[If]{.underline}**]{.mark}, for instance, **[[honoring an alliance
becomes]{.mark} so [difficult]{.mark}]{.underline}** [that]{.underline}
all **[states are forced to violate their commitments]{.underline}**
together, **[[then a violation conveys little information about how
reliable one state is]{.underline}]{.mark}** relative to another. Beyond
this extreme example, [the general insight is that [alliance
violations]{.mark}]{.underline} do more to [[signal that a state
is]{.underline}]{.mark} relatively [[unreliable
when]{.underline}]{.mark} many **[other [states appear to
be]{.mark}]{.underline}** willing and **[[able to honor the same
agreement]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Of course, whether other states would
honor a particular agreement under similar conditions is often difficult
to observe (Narang 2014; Narang and Mehta 2015), as each alliance has
elements that are somewhat unique. However, there may be times and
regions where system-level shocks cause a large number of countries to
simultaneously violate alliance commitments together. This may provide
relatively clear evidence to a potential partner that the costs of
honoring a previous alliance were so great that even reliable states
that would normally honor their commitment were unable to do so.
[This]{.underline} discussion [has important implications
for]{.underline} empirically [studying how violating an alliance affects
a state's reputation]{.underline}. It is likely that the cost of
maintaining an alliance varies significantly by region and time and that
one can identify shocks across these dimensions. Figure 1, which plots
the percentage of states violating their bilateral security alliance in
each region and year based on Leeds et al. (2009), supports this
supposition.

#### Hybrid threats are the most pressing issue to allies\-\--clarifying Article 5 alleviates abandonment fears

[**[Hybrid threats]{.mark}** and warfare represent one of **[the most
pressing]{.mark} security [issues]{.mark}**]{.underline} in contemporary
world politics. Seldom noticed and appreciated, [the
**[unravelling]{.mark} of [the international order]{.mark}**
[may]{.mark} slowly [come]{.mark} about [through]{.mark} repeated
[**hybrid blows** to **US**]{.mark} military **[cred]{.mark}**ibility
a[nd its **alliance system**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In fact, [the
unconventional nature of coercion, and the **[confusion]{.mark}** and
ambiguity central to hybrid warfare have [kindled **fears of
abandonment**]{.mark} by security partners. Because such operations fall
short of a direct and conventional "armed attack" by one state against
another, the stipulated condition for self-defence and retaliation,
**[allies]{.mark}** may **[fear]{.mark}** that in such circumstances
security **[commitments will not be upheld.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

Japan, for instance, was uncomfortable with the Obama administration's
weak-kneed response to China's steady encroachment in the South and East
China Seas, which began with China's seizure of the Scarborough Shoal in
2012. In 2015, Abe eventually secured a redefinition of the guidelines
governing the US-Japan security alliance to deter China in so-called
"grey zone" scenarios also through intelligence sharing, deeper
coordination and bilateral planning.\[7\] Somewhat [similar dynamics and
reassurances have been at play among NATO partners following Russia's
encroachment in Ukraine, but fears of abandonment persist.]{.underline}

[[Concerns of]{.mark} potential [entrapments]{.mark}, or slippery slopes
towards a full-blown military entanglement due to US security
commitments, combined with the very nature of hybrid/grey-zone
scenarios, is likely to **[cloud US decision-making]{.mark}** in such
instances. This will potentially **[slow retaliatory measures]{.mark}**
and circumstantial political factors will have more weight than ever on
such decisions. For these reasons, [Russian]{.mark}]{.underline} and
Chinese [[activities are]{.mark} currently [at the **centre of NATO
summits**]{.mark}]{.underline} and security consultations between Japan
and the United States.

#### Russian hybrid tactics threatens the unity and credibility of the alliance

Ivana **Stradner and** Max **Frost 2o**, Jeane Kirkpatrick fellow at the
American Enterprise Institute, senior research associate at the American
Enterprise Institute, NATO Has a New Weak Link for Russia to Exploit,
https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/04/22/north-macedonia-nato-russia/

In 1938, British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain made it possible for
Adolf Hitler to march into Czechoslovakia despite the overwhelming
military superiority of Prague's Western allies because Chamberlain had
decided the issue was "a quarrel in a faraway country, between people of
whom we know nothing." Today, **[[it is]{.mark}]{.underline}** similarly
[[**difficult to believe that NATO would go to war** over]{.mark} its
far-flung commitments in [Eastern Europe]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[Nevertheless]{.underline}, on March 27, [[the]{.underline}]{.mark}
Western [[alliance]{.underline}]{.mark} [admitted North Macedonia as
its]{.underline} newest---and
[weakest]{.underline}---[member]{.underline}. In so doing, [it [has
given]{.mark}]{.underline} Russian President Vladimir [[Putin a]{.mark}
terrific [opportunity to]{.mark} expand his influence]{.underline},
further [**[erode NATO's unity]{.underline}**, **[and test the bloc's
commitment]{.underline}**]{.mark} [to defend a member of the
alliance.]{.underline}

[[North Macedonia]{.mark} is the definition of a weak link and easy
pickings]{.underline} for an adversary. A landlocked country of 2
million inhabitants, it has weak political institutions and only a short
history of independence. As of 2018, it spent only 1 percent of its
GDP on defense---short of the 2 percent NATO guideline---and had
just 8,000 active-duty soldiers. [There is simmering communal tension
between a Slavic Orthodox majority and a sizable ethnic
Albanian]{.underline}, [mainly]{.underline} [Muslim]{.underline}
[minority]{.underline}, **[making it vulnerable to
interference]{.underline}**. Within NATO, [only]{.underline} neighboring
[Albania has a]{.underline} lower per capita GDP and a [higher level
of corruption]{.underline}. The Economist Intelligence Unit's Democracy
Index ranks North Macedonia as having Europe's least developed political
culture.Russia has held massive war games that were only thinly
disguised simulations of attacks on NATO members such as Poland and the
Baltic States.

Moscow has viewed NATO's expansion in Eastern Europe with suspicion
since the 1990s. Yet it wasn't until the 2000s, after Russia's military
and economy rebounded from the chaos of the post-Soviet era, that Putin
declared NATO's eastward expansion a "direct threat" and openly
confronted the alliance. [Russia's invasion of
[Georgia]{.mark}]{.underline} in 2008---not coincidentally, the year
that NATO declared an interest in Georgia's eventual accession to the
alliance---[stopped the bloc's expansion]{.underline} into former
Soviet-controlled areas in its tracks. [Putin's]{.underline} 2014
invasion of Ukraine and subsequent [annexation of
[Crimea]{.mark}]{.underline}, while not a direct assault on a NATO
member, further **[[demonstrated Western
impotence]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the face of Russian aggression.
Further north, Russia has held massive war games that military experts
say were thinly disguised simulations of attacks on NATO members such as
Poland and the Baltic States.

Now that North Macedonia has joined NATO, [[Putin appears to]{.mark} be
relishing his]{.underline} first [chance to [prove that **the alliance
is** ]{.mark}**little more than [a paper tiger]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
In 2018, Russia's ambassador to North Macedonia declared the country a
"legitimate target" if tensions between NATO and Russia were to
increase. But there was no "if" about it: Even before North Macedonia
became a member, [Russia had]{.underline} already [been working
assiduously to ratchet up tensions in the region]{.underline}. [Moscow
has]{.underline} shipped S-400 anti-aircraft missiles to neighboring
Serbia for joint Russian-Serbian military drills[, facilitated an
attempted coup]{.underline} in Montenegro, and tried to destabilize
Bosnia and Herzegovina by [stoking sectarian tensions]{.underline}. And
in North Macedonia itself, [Russia has funded **troll
factories**]{.underline} [that]{.underline}, among other things, [were
used to]{.underline} target the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign with
**[disinformation]{.underline}**. Moscow also tried to influence North
Macedonia's September 2018 referendum on NATO membership, is using its
embassy and consulates there as bases
for [intelligence-gathering ope]{.underline}rations, [and has spread
propaganda]{.underline} detailing alleged Western plots to break up the
country.

That Russia would threaten NATO's members in Eastern Europe is nothing
new, of course. Russia has long attempted to undermine the Baltic
countries---Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia---which joined NATO and the
European Union after gaining their independence from the Soviet Union.
But today, the Baltic States are well integrated into alliance
structures and the European economy and are home to thousands of NATO
troops. Whereas the Baltics have become part of NATO's well-armored
front, the Balkans are its soft underbelly.

Whereas the Baltics have become part of NATO's well-armored front, the
Balkans are its soft underbelly.

 [NATO's posture]{.underline} in North Macedonia and its neighborhood
[is very limited.]{.underline} The Balkan countries are also poorer,
more ethnically divided, and less economically integrated with Europe.
[Their potential instability]{.underline} and the much lower likelihood
of a robust response by the West [make]{.underline} North Macedonia and
its neighbors ripe and **[easy targets for Russian
meddling.]{.underline}**

Taking a page from history's playbook, Putin rightly assumes that most
decision-makers in NATO capitals would consider North Macedonia a
"faraway country" of "people of whom we know nothing." U.S. President
Donald Trump, whose relationship with Putin continues to attract
attention, confirmed a similar suspicion with regard to neighboring
Montenegro when he appeared to question NATO's commitment to defend the
Balkan nation during an interview aired on Fox News. And while some may
have taken offense at Trump's statement, the truth is he speaks for
many.

According to a February poll by the Pew Research Center, [less than
half]{.underline} the populations of [France, Spain, Turkey, and Greece
hold a favorable view of NATO.]{.underline} Pandering to the alliance's
critics, French President Emmanuel [Macron]{.underline} last
year [declared that NATO had "brain death."]{.underline} The citizens of
[only three European countries]{.underline}---Britain, the Netherlands,
and Lithuania---[say their country should respond with military force if
Russia were to attack a NATO member in Eastern Europe.]{.underline}

No surprise then that **[[NATO's posture]{.underline}]{.mark}** toward
its newest member **[[remains unclear]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Though
[NATO broadened]{.mark}]{.underline} the definition of its joint defense
commitment---**[[Article 5]{.mark}]{.underline}** of the alliance's
charter---**[[to include cyberattacks]{.mark}]{.underline}** in 2014,
**[[it has failed to clarify]{.mark} just [what that
means]{.mark}.]{.underline}** When asked what level of cyberattack on
one of its members would trigger a response, NATO Secretary-General Jens
[Stoltenberg said]{.underline} only, "[We will see]{.underline}."
[The]{.underline} 2018 [[Brussels]{.mark} Declaration reaffirmed NATO's
intent]{.underline} to defend member states from nonconventional
attacks---**[but only [meekly asserted]{.mark} that in "cases of hybrid
warfare]{.underline}**, [[the]{.mark} Council [could decide to invoke
Article 5.]{.mark}]{.underline}[" **[These Western weasel
words]{.underline}**]{.mark} will [**[have been duly noted in the
Kremlin]{.underline}**.]{.mark}

These Western weasel words will have been duly noted in the Kremlin.

[The type of meddling Russia]{.underline} has specialized in
[includes]{.underline} **[[election interference]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
[**[inflaming ethnic tensions]{.underline}**,
**[and]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[provoking violent
[conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [These]{.underline} three [real
possibilities [could trigger a NATO response]{.mark} under Article
5.]{.underline} [The most pressing issue is]{.underline} securing [North
Macedonia's upcoming elections]{.underline}, now postponed until further
notice due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Polls last showed VMRO-DPMNE,
a pro-Russian nationalist party, in a dead heat with
the pro-Western Social Democrats. Russian interference in the election
process or outcome not only threatens Macedonian sovereignty but, if
successful, could result in a government that tilts North Macedonia
toward Moscow.

[Russia may also seek to pressure and destabilize]{.underline} North
Macedonia in other ways, including through Moscow's regional client,
Serbia. [Russian propaganda]{.underline} aimed at North Macedonia
[includes conspiracy theories about the]{.underline} country's sizable
Albanian [minority supposedly colluding with NATO]{.underline} and
Albania to fold North Macedonia into a "greater Albania" amid great
bloodshed. As any student of Balkan history knows, [such rhetoric has
led to ethnic violence in the region before]{.underline}. Alternatively,
[Russia may stoke simmering conflicts]{.underline} in Serbia, whose
unstable Presevo region directly borders North Macedonia, or the
unresolved Kosovo dispute. Either conflict could easily spill into North
Macedonia.

NATO's next steps to secure its new member could include adapting the
successful tactics used when Montenegro joined the alliance in 2017. A
NATO-sponsored cyberteam provided the Montenegrin government with
technical support to learn to identify and counter hybrid warfare. NATO
raised awareness of the benefits of NATO membership by working with
officials, civil society, local governments, and media organizations. It
also worked to improve governance in Montenegro's defense sector.
Similarly, the European Union, which has just opened accession talks
with North Macedonia, could move quickly to signal to the world that the
Balkan nations are an integral part of Europe.

More broadly, however, NATO needs a mechanism to respond to Russian
aggression in the event that the alliance's members can't unanimously
agree to do so. **[[Article 5 requires unanimity]{.underline}]{.mark}**
before invoking collective defense, **[[but NATO's members
differ]{.underline}]{.mark}** [in their attitudes to
Russia.]{.underline}

Article 5 requires unanimity before invoking collective defense, but
NATO's members differ in their attitudes to Russia.

 One solution would be to form, as a backstop in case it is needed, a
coalition of the willing comprising NATO members with credible defense
capabilities that are willing to confront Russia and prepare a
collective response to any attack.

Despite NATO's overall military superiority, it has a weak hand in the
Balkans, and Russia continues to outmaneuver it there. NATO must quickly
signal that it remains steadfast and, having decided to admit it, that
North Macedonia is an integral member of the alliance. **[[If NATO fails
in its support of new members]{.underline}]{.mark}** like North
Macedonia, [[the chances have]{.mark} just [risen that it will be met
with Russian]{.mark}
[aggression]{.mark}]{.underline}---[hybrid]{.underline} or
conventional---**[[that may]{.mark} just mean the [end]{.mark} of
[NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[as a **credible
alliance**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[Some]{.underline}]{.mark} would [[argue]{.underline}]{.mark}, however,
[[that]{.underline}]{.mark} although Article V does not legally obligate
the United States to deploy military forces in defense of its NATO
allies, such a response would be essential to preserve American
credibility. In other words, [[if the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[failed to defend]{.underline}]{.mark}
its [[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} allies against Russian aggression,
[[all]{.mark} of the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tate[s' [other
allies]{.mark}]{.underline} around the globe
[[would]{.underline}]{.mark} begin to **[[doubt whether they
could]{.underline}]{.mark}** really **[[depend upon the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates.
[[Yet]{.mark} U.S. **[credibility would only suffer if Washington were
to maintain an expectation of]{.mark}**]{.underline} U.S.
[[**intervention** and]{.mark} **subsequently [failed to fulfill
that]{.mark} expectation**]{.underline}.

[If the]{.underline} incoming [[Trump]{.mark} administration is serious
about **reducing its commitment to NATO**, its first priority
[should]{.mark}]{.underline} therefore [[be to **eliminate** the
**expectation** that the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[would **automatically intervene**
]{.mark}**militarily** [in defense of]{.mark}]{.underline} its
[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} allies. For **[that expectation is the root
of the inequitable distribution of the defense burden]{.underline}**
within NATO. [Why should]{.underline} the [Europe]{.underline}an allies
[invest significantly]{.underline} in defense [if they can count on the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates to guarantee their security?
[Rather than maintaining an **implicit commitment** to spearhead any
defense of NATO]{.underline} territory (particularly in Eastern Europe),
the [Trump]{.underline} administration [could make it clear]{.underline}
to the allies [that the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [will
serve as a **balancer of last resort**]{.underline} in Europe. In other
words, the [Europe]{.underline}an allies [will bear primary
responsibility for]{.underline} the [defense]{.underline} of Europe;
[the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [will only intervene in
**dire circumstances** if they are **unable to defend
themselves**]{.underline} (much like during the two world wars).

#### Credibility theory is context specific\-\--allies care about how we treat countries similar to them, not everyone

Studies Centre at the Australian National University, "What Allies Want:
Reconsidering Loyalty, Reliability, and Alliance Interdependence," April

[[Leaders believe]{.mark} that **[if their state abandons one]{.mark}
ally** during a crisis, then their state\'s [other allies will **expect
similar**]{.mark} disloyalty in the future]{.underline}. Thus, a single
instance of disloyalty can damage, or even destroy, alliances with other
states. Because of this belief in interdependence---that developments in
one alliance will also affect other alliances---the desire to
demonstrate loyalty has exercised a tremendous influence on U.S. policy.
But is indiscriminate loyalty what allies want? [The First
[Taiwan]{.mark} Strait Crisis (1954--55) case study [suggests]{.mark}
that **[allies do not desire]{.mark}** U.S. **[loyalty]{.mark} in all
situations**.]{.underline} Instead, they want the \[US\] United States
to be a reliable ally, posing no risk of abandonment or entrapment. [In
the First Taiwan Strait Crisis, several [allies worried]{.mark} that
U.S. [loyalty]{.mark} to the Republic of China **[increased the risk
of]{.mark}** unwanted **[conflict]{.mark}**, and as the crisis
persisted, these allies sought to restrain the United States and thus
reduce the likelihood of war. Although U.S. leaders were reluctant to
coerce the Republic of China into backing down during this territorial
dispute with the People\'s Republic of China, other U.S. [allies]{.mark}
actively **[encouraged]{.mark}** such [disloyalty]{.mark}]{.underline}.
These findings have significance for theories of alliance politics and
international reputation, as well as contemporary alliance management.
Introduction Do states judge their ally\'s behavior toward its other
allies? If yes, how? Historically, decisionmakers have instinctively
adopted deterrence theory\'s logic that a state\'s character is judged
through displays of innate loyalty: if a state is disloyal to one ally,
then this will create a reputation for disloyalty, which will cause
other allies to doubt the state\'s reliability. Thus, disloyalty can
have calamitous consequences: the aggrieved ally will punish the
betrayal; other allies will suffer crises of faith; and adversaries will
conclude that the state\'s alliances are cheap talk. The logic is that
discrete alliance commitments are interdependent---that what happens in
one alliance affects the expectations of other allies---and that this
interdependence is underpinned by demonstrations of loyalty. President
Lyndon Johnson said that if the United States were "driven from the
field in Viet-nam, then no nation can ever again have the same
confidence in American promise or in American protection."1 These
convictions regularly animate contemporary debates: Nancy Bernkopf
Tucker and Bonnie Glaser argue that if the United States were to abandon
Taiwan in a conflict with China, this could deal "a fatal blow to the
U.S.-Japan alliance" and might lead to South Korea "renouncing its
security alliance with Washington and aligning with Beijing."2 Aaron
Friedberg writes that expecting a U.S. "back down ... \[and\] a Chinese
victory over Taiwan ... to leave America\'s Asian alliances unscathed,
is to indulge in wishful thinking of the most dangerous kind."3 Others
suggest cross-regional effects, claiming that by "retreating from the
Middle East and abandoning Ukraine to Russian aggression," President
Barack Obama left "America\'s Asian allies ... bewildered and
alienated."4 If alliance interdependence exists, and is governed by
innate loyalty, then fighting for reputation is crucial, because any
single alliance rift could quickly tear asunder other alliance
relationships. [Some scholars, described as "reputation skeptics,"
dispute this common wisdom. Skeptics argue that because "**[reputation
is in the eye of the beholder]{.mark}**," the United States should never
regard demonstrating loyalty as sufficient grounds for military action.5
Jonathan Mercer argues that [when allies observe]{.mark} the United
States demonstrating [loyalty]{.mark}, [they]{.mark} will [attribute
this]{.mark} desired behavior [**to situational causes**]{.mark} and
thus **will not** conclude that it will be loyal in future crises. In
contrast, he concludes that when the United States is disloyal, this
undesired behavior will be attributed to national character, but will
[not]{.mark} always **[cause allies to expect similar behavior]{.mark}**
in the future.6 Reputation skeptics believe that "leaders are tragically
**mistaken** when they commit to the **use of force** in the expectation
of long-term benefits beyond any gains in the immediate
dispute]{.underline}."7

[an]{.underline} **[unbalanced]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[volatile]{.underline}** [Middle East]{.underline} (Waltz, 2012).
Closer to the mainstream of Western strategic discourse, various experts
have argued that [[despite]{.mark} the **[risks]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[of proliferation, nuclear weapons, and the **[deterrent]{.mark}** they
provide]{.underline} should get (more) credit for
**[[contribut]{.underline}]{.mark}**ing, in combination with other
factors, [[to]{.mark} what has been labelled 'the]{.underline} **[[Long
Peace']{.underline}]{.mark}** [among the great powers since
1945]{.underline} (Gaddis, 1999, p. 268--271; Gavin, 2012a, p. 164;
Acton 2010, pp. 16--17). Still others have contended that [because
nuclear **[prolif]{.mark}**eration [is]{.mark} such a **[rare]{.mark}**
phenomenon, [and]{.mark} since **[robust]{.mark}
nonprolif**]{.underline}eration [[measures]{.mark} **tend** to

[and, therefore,]{.underline} **[manageable]{.underline}** (Mueller
2010, pp. 95--99; Hymans 2013, pp. 293--296).

The question of whether nuclear proliferation has stabilising or
destabilising effects is not just fascinating for scholars of the
nuclear age, but also highly consequential for practical policy issues.
For in order to debate the merits of particular policy choices -- such
as preventive military strikes against nuclear facilities, grand
bargains with potential proliferators or complete nuclear disarmament --
we need to understand first how the spread of nuclear weapons impacts
regional and global security.

The chapter proceeds in three steps. The first section provides the
foundation for the other parts by summarising what we know about
empirical patterns of proliferation and the utility of nuclear weapons
for statecraft. The second section then engages the literature on the
consequences of proliferation, focusing in particular on how
proliferation has influenced international stability. The final section
explores whether some states have been more affected than others, and
what measures these states have taken to prevent proliferation, or at
least mitigate its negative consequences.

Patterns of nuclear proliferation and the utility of nuclear weapons

Nuclear proliferation is commonly defined as the spread of nuclear
weapons to states that did not previously have them. Within a broader
conceptual framework that is rarely used by scholars, yet popular in the
arms control community, this diffusion of nuclear weapons to additional
states is labelled horizontal proliferation. It is conceptually
accompanied by the notion of vertical proliferation, which refers to
qualitative improvements and increases in the number of nuclear weapons
in the stockpiles of existing nuclear weapon states. In accordance with
the typical usage of the term in the scholarly debate, this chapter
focuses only on how the horizontal proliferation of nuclear weapons
affects international stability.

One important empirical pattern that has shaped how nuclear
proliferation is understood concerns the way in which nuclear weapons
have spread. [The word]{.underline} **[['spread']{.underline}]{.mark}**
[appears to suggest that the **established**]{.underline} nuclear
[powers have]{.underline} [**provide**d]{.underline} [other interested
nations with (at least a few) operational nuclear warheads.]{.underline}
**[Yet such transfers have [never]{.mark} been
[undertaken]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [Certainly, states that sought
nuclear weapons have often received]{.underline} significant
**[assistance]{.underline}** from other nations (Schofield, 2014;
Fuhrmann, 2012), [sometimes in the form of]{.underline} highly sensitive
**[tech]{.underline}**nologies (Kroenig, 2010).
[Nonetheless,]{.underline} since **[all]{.underline}** these transfers
[[remained]{.underline}]{.mark} **[well [below]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[the]{.underline} **[[weapons]{.mark} threshold]{.underline}**, nations
seeking nuclear weapons always had to build them indigenously. Hence,
[in reality, the spread of nuclear weapons has meant that merely the
**ambition**]{.underline} [to possess a nuclear arsenal has
spread]{.underline} to additional states, each of which then had to
pursue that goal primarily through indigenous efforts.

[Importantly, since a state's national [efforts]{.mark} to turn
its]{.underline} **[desire]{.underline}** for nuclear weapons
[into]{.underline} **[reality]{.underline}** [naturally
[span]{.mark}]{.underline} several (and sometimes **[many)
[years]{.mark}]{.underline}**, nuclear **[prolif]{.underline}**eration
[must be conceived of as a]{.underline} **[process]{.underline}**, as
opposed to just a single step (Meyer, 1986). This point is reinforced by
the fact that **[[29]{.underline}]{.mark}** out **[[of
39]{.underline}]{.mark}** states [[that]{.mark} have]{.underline}
**[[embarked]{.underline}]{.mark}** [upon that path]{.underline} (Müller
and Schmidt, 2010, p. 157; Mikoyan, 2012; Santoro, 2017)
[have]{.underline} **[[not acquired]{.mark} a]{.underline}** nuclear
**[arsenal]{.underline}**. Hence, a lot of nuclear proliferation
activity has been undertaken by nations that did not ultimately become
nuclear weapon states. Three patterns explain this situation.

First, [[owing]{.underline}]{.mark} not just [[to]{.mark}
the]{.underline} **[[tech]{.mark}nological]{.underline}**, but also the
[**[institutional]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[managerial

[[nations]{.mark} simply **[failed]{.mark} in their
efforts**]{.underline} to build the bomb (Hymans, 2012;
Braut-Hegghammer, 2016). Second, a few countries have chosen a nuclear
'hedging' strategy, intentionally confining their efforts to developing
the technological capability to build an arsenal quickly while
refraining from exercising that option (Narang, 2016--17, p. 134).
Third, [[several]{.mark} states have **[undertake]{.mark}**n a '[nuclear
**reversal'**, **abandoning**]{.mark}]{.underline} [their]{.underline}
nuclear [weapons [activities]{.mark}]{.underline} before developing
nuclear explosive devices (Müller and Schmidt, 2010).

That [logic]{.underline} might seem plausible at first, but it [**breaks
down** on close examination. Not only has the [world]{.mark} **already
[survived]{.mark}** the [acquisition]{.mark} of nuclear weapons
[by]{.mark} some of the **craziest [mass murderers]{.mark}** in history
(**Stalin** and **Mao**), but [**prolif**eration]{.mark} has
**[slowed]{.mark} down** [rather than **sped up**]{.mark} over time.
**Dozens** of technologically sophisticated countries have
**considered** obtaining nuclear arsenals, but **very [few]{.mark} have
[do]{.mark}ne [so]{.mark}**. This is because **[nuc]{.mark}**lear
weapon[**s** turn out]{.mark} to be **[difficult]{.mark}** and
**[expensive]{.mark}** to acquire [and]{.mark} **strategically
[provocative]{.mark}** [to possess]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

[They have not even proved to enhance status much, as many expected they
would. Pakistan and Russia may garner more attention today than they
would without nukes, but would Japan\'s prestige be increased if it
became nuclear? Did China\'s status improve when it went nuclear --- or
when its economy grew? And would anybody really care (or even notice) if
the current British or French nuclear arsenal was doubled or
halved?]{.underline}

[[Alarmists]{.underline}]{.mark} have [[**misjudged** not only]{.mark}
the **[pace]{.mark}** of proliferation [but]{.mark} also its
**[effects]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Proliferation is incredibly dangerous
and necessary to prevent, we are told, because going nuclear would
supposedly empower rogue states and lead them to dominate their region.
The details of how this domination would happen are rarely discussed,
but the general idea seems to be that once a country has nuclear
weapons, it can use them to threaten others and get its way, with
nonnuclear countries deferring or paying ransom to the local bully out
of fear.

Except, of course, that in three-quarters of a century, the United
States has never been able to get anything close to that obedience from
anybody, even when it had a nuclear monopoly. So why should it be true
for, say, Iran or North Korea? It is far more likely that [[a]{.mark}
nuclear [rogue\'s threats]{.mark}]{.underline} would [cause]{.underline}
its [[rivals to **join together**]{.mark} **against** the provocateur
--- [just as]{.mark} countries around [the]{.mark} Persian [Gulf
responded to **Saddam**]{.mark}\'s invasion of Kuwait [by **closing
ranks**]{.mark} **to oppose**, [rather than
**acquiescing**]{.mark}]{.underline} in, his effort at domination.

THIRTY-ONE countries, from Brazil to Sweden, have flirted with nuclear

RUSSIAN GRAY ZONE CONFLICT\", https://calhoun.nps.edu/handle/10945/64844

2\. Applying Deterrence in the Context of Russian Behavior

This section builds on the previous assessments and [explores the
application of deterrence theory at the **sub-conventional
level**]{.underline} [in the]{.underline} specific [context of
Russia]{.underline} as a state actor [and its]{.underline} use of a
[gray zone strategy]{.underline}. It considers the [value of
**tailoring** a deterrent strategy against Russian gray zone conflict by
**supplementing** conventional deterrence with]{.underline}
"**[cumulative deterrence]{.underline}**." Recall that any deterrence
strategy relies on sufficient capabilities, solid resolve, and strong
communication of a threat, which in turn create credibility.225
[Cumulative deterrence]{.underline}, elaborated in the following
paragraphs, [introduces the idea that **credibility** can
be]{.underline} **[sustained]{.underline}** [across **multiple
encounters** even if deterrence fails in **certain
instances**]{.underline}, [vis-à-vis **classic**
**zero-tolerance**]{.underline} [nuclear deterrence]{.underline}.

Regarding tailoring deterrence, Bunn writes, "If deterrence is about
influencing the perceptions---and ultimately, the decisions and
actions---of another party, it is logical that the [requirements for
deterrence will differ with each]{.underline} party that we might try to
deter and may well differ in each [circumstance or
scenario]{.underline}."226 [**Adapting deterrence** to the
**subconventional level**]{.underline} [requires an understanding of the
unique relationship between the states to identify the relative
stability and instability that can inform deterrence
strategy.]{.underline}

The [stability--instability paradox applies to the **nuclear** and
**conventional**]{.underline} [level]{.underline}, [and]{.underline}
indeed, [Russia's effort to]{.underline} **[avoid]{.underline}**
[conventional-level warfare with the United States **strengthens
stability** between the states at the]{.underline} **[conventional
level]{.underline}** similar to the strategic nuclear level. While
U.S.--Russian nuclear stability is based on parity, conventional
stability in this relationship is more complex. As shown in Chapter II,
Russia has a strong aversion to conflict with the United States and NATO
at the conventional level. Russia would be outmatched in military
superiority after two to three weeks of conflict and beyond its near
abroad and, thus, prefers to operate at the sub-conventional level below
the threshold of armed conflict.227 In effect, [Russia's strategy of
**avoiding** any actions that might trigger **conventional
conflict**]{.underline} [aims to bolster a sort of "**firewall**"
between]{.underline} [conventional warfare and gray zone
conflict]{.underline}. [NATO, up to now, has **effectively obliged**
this Russian strategy by **not brandishing threats of conventional
escalation**]{.underline} [in response to Russian gray zone aggression,
**let alone undertaking conventional responses.** As much as
[Russia]{.mark} seeks **to avoid escalation** to conventional warfare it
could not win, it [is]{.mark} also [learning]{.mark} [**how averse NATO
is** to **threaten**]{.mark} **such [escalation]{.mark}**. This aversion
is **ironic**]{.underline} insofar as Cold War--era extended deterrence
relied on NATO's threat of escalatory nuclear responses to conventional
attacks.

[These respective]{.underline} [Russian and [NATO posture]{.mark}s
**enhance conventional stability**]{.underline}, [but at the **cost** of
**[fuel]{.mark}ing [instability]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[at the **gray
zone**]{.mark} **level**]{.underline}, [reflecting a form of the
stability-- instability paradox familiar in nuclear
strategies]{.underline}. This tailored application of the stability--
instability paradox to the specific Russian context yields a tiered
relationship of stability between the United States and Russia at each
level of warfare, as depicted in Figure 1, and helps explain why the
United States and Russia are the most unstable at the subconventional
level, on which this research focuses.

**[Cumulative deterrence]{.underline}** [may be an option to **address
the issues** created when adapting conventional deterrence to the
sub-conventional level]{.underline} including the credibility and
communication of the threat. Cumulative deterrence has not been a
standard element of U.S. deterrence strategy in the past, and there is
limited academic literature and strategic thought about its use in areas
outside of cyber and terrorism. However, this [new security environment
characterized by great power competition at levels **below open
conflict**]{.underline} [requires a **new way**]{.underline} [of looking
at the deterrence landscape at the]{.underline} **[sub-conventional
level]{.underline}**. [Subject matter experts for this research
confirm]{.underline} that [[a **zero-tolerance**]{.mark}
[deterrence]{.mark} mindset **[will not work]{.mark}** at the
sub-conventional level and that [the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [might [have to **choose**]{.mark} **[what
portions of]{.mark} the [gray zone it wants to deter]{.mark} because it
may be [difficult to deter everything]{.mark}.**]{.underline}229

There is a precedent for applying a cumulative model and mindset of
deterrence to limit and shape the sub-conventional level of conflict,
and this suggests it may also be applied to the current U.S. need to
deter Russia's gray zone conflict. According to Thomas Rid, [[cumulative
deterrence]{.mark} "consists of a series of acts of force to
create]{.underline}---[and [maintain]{.mark}]{.underline}--- [general
**[norms of behavior]{.mark}**]{.underline} [for many political actors
[over]{.mark} an **[extended period.]{.mark}**]{.underline} [Using
force,]{.underline} consequently, [does **not** represent a principal
**failure of deterrence**]{.underline} [but its **maintenance** through
**swift**]{.underline}, **[certain]{.underline}**, [but]{.underline}
**[measured]{.underline}** [responses]{.underline}."230 Cumulative
deterrence has been a key part of Israel's strategy for decades and was
developed in the conventional and subconventional level focusing on
limiting and shaping ongoing conflicts against both state and non-state
actors at the conventional and sub-conventional level.231 In addition,
cumulative deterrence has recently been considered for use in deterring
terrorism and cyberattacks, as it is designed for long-term sustained
conflict, such as competition in the gray zone.232

Doron Almong describes cumulative deterrence as functioning on two
levels: the macro, which creates an image of overwhelming military
superiority, and the micro, which relies on responses to adversarial
actions.233 Almong also explains that cumulative deterrence has three
key features.

First, its [effectiveness is measured in terms of the number of
victories **accumulated** over the **duration** of the
conflict,]{.underline} which might be envisioned as "assets in a victory
bank." Second, [over time, these victories produce]{.underline}
**[increasingly moderate behavior]{.underline}** [on the part of the
adversary and a shift in its **strategic**]{.underline},
**[operational]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} **[tactical
goals]{.underline}** [until there is a **near-absence** of **direct
conflict.**]{.underline} Third, [this moderation may **eventually**
result in **political negotiations** and perhaps even a **peace
agreement**.]{.underline}234 Almong is describing cumulative deterrence
as applied to the conventional level of warfare; however, in the context
of Russia, the construct can be transposed to the subconventional level.
[At the sub-conventional level, [U.S. responses over time]{.mark} to
Russian gray zone aggression [could **moderate Russian
behavior**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [causing a **shift** in Russia's
**decision calculus** and **strategic goals,** thereby
**[diminishing]{.mark} the [conflict]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

The advantage of layering a strong conventional deterrence strategy with
cumulative deterrence is that it allows the restoration of deterrence
over time if conventional threats fail to deter at the sub-conventional
level. **[Over time]{.underline}**, [cumulative deterrence responses to
gray zone actions **[bolster]{.mark} the
[cred]{.mark}ibility**]{.underline} [[of the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates and **alter Russia's decision calculus**]{.underline}
[at the sub-conventional level, therefore **[strengthening]{.mark}
[deterrence overall]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[**Successful deterrence**
at the **sub-conventional level** requires]{.mark} a
**[reorientation]{.mark}**]{.underline} [in how the U.S. **views
deterrence**]{.underline}, [moving [from a **zero-tolerance
strategy**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[to]{.mark} the [**long-term**
attrition]{.mark} of gray zone conflict]{.underline}. [This renewed
mindset allows for **tailored** punitive]{.underline} [strategies that
**over time** **limit the bounds**]{.underline} [of the gray zone
through the **reiteration** of **unacceptable behavior**]{.underline}
through punishment. Regardless of the level at which a state wishes to
conduct warfare, all deterrence strategies rely on three aspects that
must work in concert: sufficient capabilities, solid credibility, and
strong communication of a threat.235 As Rid explains,
[[confrontations]{.mark} should be "seen as necessary evils that should
be kept on **as low a level as possible**, **but that [could not be
pushed]{.mark} down [to zero]{.mark}**]{.underline}."236 This argument
assumes escalation control, which is to say that the United States can
control escalation at the sub-conventional level on its own terms.

Many authors challenge the notion of escalation control, claiming that
it is risky and nearly impossible. Scholars claim that avoiding
escalation requires deterring the action and that a policy to deter one
action could in fact risk escalation to another. Additionally, scholars
claim, "Escalation control or management is an inherently imperfect
business. It can be done well or poorly, but it is extremely rare for
any set of policies to eliminate the risk of significant escalation
altogether."237 These same scholars agree that the risk of inadvertent
escalation can be reduced, but they are concerned that policy makers are
incorrectly assuming it can be eliminated altogether.238 The concerns
over escalation control are valid; however, it is possible to control
escalation and use the threat of escalation to bolster deterrence.
Mazarr explains that the gray zone puts the defender in the position to
escalate, which is part of the challenge of deterrence.239 Both
escalation control and deterrence fundamentally rely on communication
and a thorough understanding of the adversary. Proper communication of
the capability and the resolve to use the capability to deny or punish
an action are just as crucial to escalation control as they are to
deterrence. The same scholars who express concerns over escalation
control also admit there is a way to control the risk: "Escalation
depends heavily on an astute understanding of how the adversary will
perceive and interpret events that have not yet occurred---not only in a
general sense, but also under the specific and often
difficult-to-predict conditions that will shape the opponent's
perceptions and responses when a particular event occurs."240 The United
States can both mitigate escalation and contribute to deterrence by
adding an element of ambiguity to its deterrence threats that leave
something to chance but also allow a response that limits or controls
the escalatory response of the adversary.

When the United States responds with an instrument of state power in any
DIME category, such as the expulsion of 60 Russian diplomats in response
to the Russian nerve agent attack on a British citizen in 2018, it can
strengthen cumulative deterrence credibility. Some of the literature on
cumulative deterrence suggests that deterrence works by banking "wins"
by responding to events with military power. However, when adapted to
the gray zone, it seems critical that all elements of state power must
be utilized, not just the military[. The military is
**sometimes**]{.underline}---**[not always]{.underline}**---[an
appropriate response to an action in the gray zone]{.underline}, [so
[threatening military retaliation for]{.mark}]{.underline} [[**every
tactic** in the gray zone is **not credible**]{.underline}]{.mark};
however, a state must still have the ability to impose costs on an
adversary for an action to make cumulative deterrence successful.

#### Strategic ambiguity [spurs escalation]{.underline} in [cyberspace specifically]{.underline} because it's an [offense-dominant]{.underline} domain\-\--[norms]{.underline} solve

**[Escalation]{.underline}** **[follows]{.underline}** [from the
**nature of cyber attacks**]{.underline} [and the **dynamics of
cyberspace**]{.underline} (Floridi and Taddeo 2014a, b; Taddeo 2014a,
2016, 2017). Non[-kinetic [cyber
attacks]{.mark}]{.underline}---[aggressive uses of information and
communications]{.underline} [technologies that do not cause destruction
or casualties]{.underline}, e.g. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)
attacks---**[[cost little]{.underline}]{.mark}** [in terms of
**resources**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[risks]{.underline}** [to
the attackers, [while having **high**]{.mark} **chances**]{.underline}
[to be **[success]{.mark}ful**]{.underline}, e.g. impairing the services
of targeted server or website. At the same time, cyber defence is porous
by its own nature (Morgan 2012): every system has bugs in the program
(vulnerabilities), identifying and exploiting them is just a matter of
time, means, and determination. This makes even the most sophisticated
cyber defence mechanisms ephemeral and, thus, limits their potential to
deter new attacks.

[Even when successful, cyber defence does not lead to **strategic
advantages**]{.underline}, [insofar as **dismounting a cyber
attack**]{.underline}, [may bring **tactical success**]{.underline},
[but very rarely leads to the ultimate]{.underline} **[defeating of an
adversary]{.underline}** (Taddeo 2017). [This [creates an environment of
**persistent offence**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Harknett and Goldman 2016),
[[where attacking is **tactically**]{.underline}]{.mark}
[and]{.underline} **[strategically]{.underline}** [[more
advantageous]{.underline} [than]{.underline}
**[defending]{.underline}**]{.mark}.

As Haknett and Goldman argue, [in an offence-persistent]{.underline}
[environment, [defence can achieve]{.mark} tactical and operational
[success]{.mark} in the short term if it can adjust constantly to the
means of attack, [but]{.mark} it **[cannot win]{.mark}
strategically**]{.underline}. **[Offence will persist]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} [the **interactions** with the enemy]{.underline}
[will remain **constant**]{.underline}. This is why inter-state cyber
defence have shifted from reactive (defending) towards an active
(countering) defence strategies.

[In this scenario, state actors make policy decisions to protect their
abilities to launch cyber attacks.]{.underline} **[Strategic
ambiguity]{.underline}** [is one of these decisions]{.underline}.
[According to this policy, states decide neither to **define**
nor]{.underline} [to]{.underline} **[inform]{.underline}**
[the]{.underline} [international community about **their red
lines**]{.underline}---thresholds that once crossed would trigger state
response--- [for non-kinetic cyber attacks]{.underline} (Mariarosaria
Taddeo 2011). [This approach leaves]{.underline} **[de facto
unregulated]{.underline}** [cyber attacks]{.underline} [that
remain]{.underline} **[below the threshold]{.underline}** [of an armed
attack]{.underline}. [[Strategic ambiguity]{.mark} has]{.underline}
often [been presented as a way to **confuse the opponents**]{.underline}
[about the consequences of their cyber attacks]{.underline}. As the US
National Intelligence Officer for Cyber Issues officer put it:

Currently most countries, including ours, don't want to be incredibly
specific about the red lines for two reasons: [You don't want to invite
people to do anything they want **below that red line** thinking they'll
be able to do it **with impunity**]{.underline}, [and]{.underline}
secondly, [you don't want to back yourself into a **strategic
corner**]{.underline} [where you have to respond if they do something
above that red line or else lose credibility]{.underline} in a
geopolitical sense.6

[By fostering ambiguity, state actor]{.underline}s also [leave open for
themselves a **wider room** for **manoeuvring**]{.underline}. [Strategic
ambiguity allows state actors to **deploy cyber attacks** for military,
espionage, sabotage, and surveillance purposes]{.underline} **[without
being constrained]{.underline}** [by their own policies or international
red lines. This makes ambiguity]{.underline} a **[dangerous
choice]{.underline}**, [one that is **strategically risky**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} **[politically misleading.]{.underline}**

[The [risks]{.mark} [come with]{.mark} the [**cascade effect**
following]{.mark} the [**absence** of **clear
thresholds**]{.mark}]{.underline} [for cyber attacks]{.underline}. [The
lack of thresholds **[facilitates]{.mark} a [prolif]{.mark}eration [of
offensive strategies]{.mark}.**]{.underline} [[This]{.mark}, in turn,
[favours a]{.mark}n **international [cyber arms
race]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and]{.mark} the **[weaponization]{.mark}
of cyberspace,**]{.underline} [[which]{.mark} ultimately [spurs]{.mark}
the **[escalation]{.mark} of cyber attacks.** This is why strategic
ambiguity is a **policy hazard** that]{.underline}
**[fuels]{.underline}**, [rather than **arrests**]{.underline},
**[escalation]{.underline}** [of **interstate cyber
attacks**]{.underline}. [[Cyber attacks would be **deterred more
effectively**]{.underline} [by a **regime of international
norms**]{.underline} (]{.mark}defining proportionality criteria for
responses, setting red lines, and procedure for accountability, and for
capability building) [[that make]{.mark}s **[attacks politically
costly]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[to the point of being
**disadvantageous**]{.underline}]{.mark} [for the state actors who
launch them]{.underline}.

As I mention in Sect. 3.1, stability of cyberspace hinges on both
regulations and strategies. Having considered the limits of the existing
approaches to the regulation of state behaviour in cyberspace, I shall
now focus on existing view for the designing deterrence strategies for
cyber attacks.

#### Strategic ambiguity fails -- triggers fights that [slow responses]{.underline}, [crack cohesion]{.underline}, and undermines Article 5 writ large

**Lonergan and Moller 22** - Erica D. Lonergan is an assistant professor
in the Army Cyber Institute and a research scholar at the Saltzman
Institute of War and Peace Studies at Columbia University. Sara B.
Moller is a former Eisenhower Fellow at the NATO Defense College and
will be joining the Center for Security Studies at Georgetown University

//nt-sg

But despite this rhetoric, [exactly how and when [Article 5]{.mark}
applies to [cyber]{.mark}space remains unclear. This [ambiguity is a
problem]{.mark} --- with potentially **disastrous consequences**.
[Staking]{.mark} the [cred]{.mark}ibility of Article 5
[to]{.mark}]{.underline} what are often [[murky activities in cyberspace
threatens to **undermine**]{.mark} the broader principle of
[**collective defense.** We can't risk fracturing the]{.mark}
transatlantic [alliance]{.mark} at a critical juncture in its history
over a debate on what constitutes a major or minor
cyberattack.]{.underline} For that reason, [[NATO
should]{.mark}]{.underline} move quickly to clarify its policy on
cyberattacks and [[**explicitly state** the threshold]{.mark} for what
would trigger an Article 5 response.]{.underline} Furthermore, NATO
members should commit to treating cyberattacks that do not rise to the
level of a major attack as a national matter --- not one for the
alliance.

Such a shift might face some initial resistance, particularly in light
of the Kremlin's history of malicious cyber activities. One of the first
state-initiated cyberattacks was perpetrated by Russia against Estonia,
a NATO member, in 2007. In the intervening years, Moscow has increased
its malicious cyber activities, such as the SolarWinds breach uncovered
in December 2020 in which Russia gained access to a treasure trove of
U.S. data. Russian President Vladimir Putin's maneuvers against NATO
members, along with the annexation of Crimea in 2014, spurred the
alliance to adopt a Cyber Defense Pledge in 2016 that recognized
cyberspace as a military domain. Two years later, NATO created a
Cyberspace Operations Center in Mons, Belgium to improve situational
awareness and coordinate cyber operations. Since then, the alliance has
consistently reaffirmed the application of Article 5 to cyberspace. At
the 2021 summit in Brussels, NATO committed to a new Comprehensive Cyber
Defense Policy, with allies agreeing to employ the "full range of
capabilities" at all times to "deter, defend against, and counter the
full spectrum of cyber threats."

Notably, NATO refined its language with last summer's summit communique
to account for the fact that some cyber incidents may not be
individually decisive, but nevertheless significant when viewed in the
aggregate. Specifically, the allies recognized "the impact of
significant malicious cumulative cyber activities might, in certain
circumstances, be considered as amounting to an armed attack." In
practice, however, [NATO leaders have **avoided clarifying** the
conditions under which a cyberattack would trigger Article 5 and how
NATO would respond.]{.underline} When pressed about Russian cyberattacks
in the Ukraine context, Stoltenberg cautioned that, ["we have never gone
into the position where we give a potential adversary the privilege of
defining exactly when we trigger Article 5."]{.underline}

This equivocation is not surprising, for several reasons. [The [nature
of cyberspace]{.mark}]{.underline} often [[**confounds**
unequivocal]{.mark} deterrence [declarations]{.mark}.
States]{.underline} tend to [operate in cyberspace with **plausible
deniability**]{.underline}, [which can make it difficult to rapidly
ascertain responsibility for cyber incidents]{.underline}. Also, it can
be [challenging to understand the **intent** behind observed cyber
behavior, and there is often a **substantial time lag** between when an
initial penetration of a network occurs and when the target even
realizes the breach. And the vast majority of cyber operations cause
**virtual, not physical, damage**, complicating efforts to assess and
evaluate the implications of the costs inflicted.]{.underline}
Moreover[, it can take time to develop and identify a way to infiltrate
a network as well as the computer code that takes advantage of a
vulnerability for malicious ends. This means [states]{.mark} may [**lack
a palatable cyber response** option]{.mark} for retaliatory purposes at
the desired time.]{.underline}

[[This creates]{.mark} a **slew of**]{.underline} practical
[[**problems**]{.mark} if Article 5 were to be invoked for a
cyberattack]{.underline}. From an implementation perspective, [it would
trigger deliberations within the North Atlantic Council]{.underline},
NATO's primary decision-making body. [Decisions made within the NAC
require **unanimity**, which can be difficult to achieve for many issues
but is especially **burdensome** for cyber ones, given all of the
ambiguities]{.underline} outlined above[. The most likely outcome of
this process would be a]{.underline} long, drawn-out deliberation
resulting in a [**divided alliance** unable to agree on how or whether
to respond]{.underline}. Quite simply, [some allies are unlikely to want
to risk World War III for a cyberattack that disrupts the financial
infrastructure, for instance, of another country but doesn't lead to
loss of life or sustained damage.]{.underline}

[These challenges have major **strategic implications** for NATO. After
years of publicly and repeatedly linking Article 5 to cyberspace and
reinforcing that policy in response to the Ukraine conflict, a [failure
to achieve consensus and respond]{.mark} to a Russian cyberattack
against a NATO member [could **imperil Article 5** in other
areas]{.mark}.]{.underline} [The [disunity]{.mark} that is likely to be
[revealed]{.mark} during NAC deliberations [would]{.mark} then
[undermine]{.mark} the [broader]{.mark} political
[cohesion]{.mark}]{.underline} that has, for the most part, been
remarkably strong throughout the war in Ukraine. [[This would make
it]{.mark} more [**difficult for the alliance to respond** to
other]{.mark} forms of [Russian behavior]{.mark}.]{.underline} As Biden
emphasized at a press conference last month, ["the single-most important
thing is for us to stay unified ... We have to stay fully, totally,
thoroughly unified."]{.underline}

### A5 Key\-\--2AC

#### Need to determine [thresholds]{.underline} for 'armed attack'\-\--the CP results in [both]{.underline} [over-escalation]{.underline} AND [incoherent response]{.underline}

Attack" in light of Collective Self-Defence against Cyber Attacks:

[While it is exciting that]{.underline}, according to the Wales Summit
Declaration, [NATO's Enhanced Cyber Defence Policy]{.underline} for the
first time [explicitly mentions that Article 5 **can be invoked** in
case of cyber attacks, it is **unfortunate**]{.underline} [that [there
is]{.mark}]{.underline} [[no]{.underline}]{.mark} more
**[guidance]{.underline}** [on **[criteria]{.mark}** [for]{.mark} [cyber
attacks to **reach**]{.mark} the]{.underline} **[required
[threshold]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Indeed, [there is no]{.underline}
definite **[procedure]{.underline}** [available with regard to **Article
5.**]{.underline} [The decision [to **invoke**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[Article]{.mark} [5]{.mark} is a **political decision**]{.underline} as
it is taken by the member countries through the NAC, NATO's principal
political decisionmaking body.38 [A general challenge for the NAC is to
take decisions by **consensus**]{.underline} [as views will
**differ**]{.underline} [among 28 sovereign States]{.underline}.
Similarly, [[States have different views]{.mark} [on]{.mark} the
**threshold of "[armed attack]{.mark}**" in the context of cyber
attacks.]{.underline}

[The threshold of "armed attack" is **generally understood** to entail
**physical damage**, **destruction**]{.underline},
**[injury]{.underline}** [or]{.underline} **[death]{.underline}**.
**[However]{.underline}**, [[some States]{.mark} already]{.underline},
[or **[will]{.mark}**]{.underline}[, [support a **lower
threshold**]{.underline}]{.mark} [to include highly disruptive cyber
attacks without physical consequences]{.underline}.39 [It may require a
**long debate** to reach **agreement**]{.underline} [on whether such
cyber attacks]{.underline} **[constitute]{.underline}** [an "**armed
attack**]{.underline}" [and]{.underline} **[trigger]{.underline}** the
application of **[Article 5.]{.underline}** The controversy surrounding
the threshold is also demonstrated by the fact that the International
Group of Experts, consisting of legal practitioners, academics, and
technical experts, could not agree on whether cyber attacks without
physical consequences qualify as armed attacks.40 Likewise, [it [will be
a]{.mark} **significant [challenge]{.mark}** [for the **NAC** to **reach
agreement**]{.mark} on whether the threshold has been
reached.]{.underline}

NATO not only faces general challenges as described above in the case of
cyber attacks, but cyber attacks also pose a particular challenge to
NATO. **[National policies]{.underline}** [on cyber defence will differ
even more due to **rapid technological developments**]{.underline} and
growing technological capabilities. States are having a hard time
keeping up with all the developments. [Some States have more progressive
cyber defence policies, whereas other States opt for a conservative
policy]{.underline}. Additionally, no cyber attack has thus far been
publicly declared as an "armed attack" by a State.41 A particular issue
of the disruptive cyber attacks is that their effects are so remote from
the effects of traditional attacks that reach the threshold of "armed
attack." Cyber attacks are capable of doing so much more without
actually causing physical damage, destruction, injury or death. The
effects of disruptive cyber attacks do not correspond with the described
effects and examples given by the ICJ. Consequently, States could be or
are more reluctant to recognise certain disruptive cyber attacks without
physical consequences as "armed attacks."

By invoking Article 5 in response to the terrorist attacks of 9/11, NATO
member countries demonstrated that they could quickly reach an agreement
and take a step forward.42 Nevertheless, taking a step forward with
regard to the threshold of "armed attack" may encounter more resistance
from individual member countries. [It could be]{.underline}
"**[dangerous]{.underline}**" [to set a precedent with regard to the
**criteria**]{.underline} [for highly disruptive cyber attacks to
constitute an]{.underline} "[armed attack]{.underline}." Both
[thresholds]{.underline} [of]{.underline} "the use of force" and
"**[armed attack]{.underline}**" [must be **preserved**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} the latter [must remain **high**]{.underline}er. [[If
the threshold is **lowered too much**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [more cyber
attacks would reach the threshold and [it would]{.mark} [be]{.mark}come
**[easier]{.mark}** [for States to **use force**]{.mark} in
self-defence]{.underline}.43 [The standard must remain **sufficiently
high** to ensure that [only the **gravest** forms]{.mark} of cyber
attacks [can **trigger**]{.mark} **the application** of [Article
5.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[A]{.underline} **[long debate]{.underline}** [will be
required]{.underline}]{.mark} [to determine whether Article 5 can be
invoked in the case of a highly disruptive cyber attack]{.underline}
without effects equivalent to traditional armed attacks. [The envisaged
**[disagreement]{.mark}** [on]{.mark} the threshold of "[armed
attack"]{.mark} in cases of cyber attacks [could]{.mark}
have]{.underline} [an]{.underline} **[adverse
[effect]{.mark}]{.underline}** [on [NATO's]{.mark} [ability to **swiftly
respond**]{.mark}]{.underline} [to a cyber attack. [There is]{.mark} a
**significant [risk]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[in **waiting**]{.mark}
[until]{.mark} such [a]{.mark} cyber [attack occurs to decide
**whether**]{.mark}]{.underline} [the [criteria are **met**]{.mark} [to
**trigger**]{.mark} **the application of [Article
5]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [NATO's ability to swiftly respond will not
only be severely hampered, but it [may]{.mark} also **entirely
[prevent]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[NATO to **respond**]{.mark}
**collectively with force**]{.underline}. [When the NAC is **unable to
reach consensus**, the NATO ally that is the object of a serious cyber
attack]{.underline} without physical consequences[, is left
**without**]{.underline} [one of the **crucial benefits** of **being a
member**]{.underline} [of [NATO]{.mark}. The member country [would be
**unable to rely on c**]{.mark}**ollective
[s]{.mark}elf-[d]{.mark}efence** under Article 5.]{.underline}

[[Given the]{.mark} existing capability]{.underline}, [**[policy and

**[absence of criteria]{.mark}** [what constitutes **an armed
attack**]{.mark}, [deliberations]{.mark} would be
**[thorny.]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[NATO's decision-making
process]{.underline}]{.mark} might be [**[delayed]{.mark}**]{.underline}
also [by the [scarce understanding of]{.mark} operational and technical
aspects of **[cyber defence]{.mark}**]{.underline}, as well as the
[**[lack of]{.mark}** general [**consensus** on key cyber]{.mark}

the decision-making process and craft effective responses, the

attack]{.mark} as an armed attack, [if and when]{.mark} pre-emptive
cyber strike or kinetic [response would be allowed]{.mark}]{.underline}
(the response might be limited to entirely non-kinetic measures) 54,
[which kind of response would be proportional]{.underline}, etc.55 It
has been suggested to institute a high level advisory body, a Senior
Cyber Committee (similar to a NATO's nuclear planning group) consisting
of technical experts, policy personnel, and military representatives to
discuss regularly cyber security in the Allied context. 56 This would
help to reduce the lack of understanding between technical and strategic
levels, keep senior decisionmakers attention on cyber security and
facilitate timely decision maki

#### NATO discussion [on Article 5 key]{.underline}

Jarno **Limnéll 16**, Professor of Cybersecurity, Aalto University,
Finland, Charly Salonius-Pasternak, Senior Research Fellow, The Finnish
Institute of International Affairs, Challenge for NATO -- Cyber Article
5, Briefing Paper, Published by the Center for Asymmetric Threat
Studies, June 2016, Swedish Defence University,
https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1119569/FULLTEXT01.pdf

Another solution that might be less effective than the development of a
new international regime is to [continue the work that has already
started within NATO related to finding solutions for cyber defense that
are **binding for NATO member**]{.underline} [and partner
states]{.underline}. In this regard, [[**political consensus** has to be
achieved]{.underline}]{.mark} between 28 member states, [especially
considering those situations when cyber threats have given reason
[for]{.mark} the **[activation]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[of]{.underline}]{.mark} Article 4 or **[[Article
5]{.underline}]{.mark}** [of]{.underline} [the]{.underline} [**N**orth
**A**tlantic **T**reaty]{.underline}. This task is because here [allies
must agree upon **kinetic actions**]{.underline} [that might be taken
against state and non-state actors out of NATO if necessary **[in
specific situation]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[This [**consensus process** would]{.mark}]{.underline} also [[be
a]{.mark} significant [**step forward** in **finding solutions**
for]{.mark} **countering [hybrid threats]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[considering the strong **connection between hybrid and cyber
threats**]{.underline}. A positive aspect is that after the 2007
cyber-attacks against Estonia the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Centre
of Excellence was created and one of its tasks is to analyze and seek
legal solutions related to NATO cyber defense.235 [The [products]{.mark}
made by NATO of course [will]{.mark} [be]{.mark}]{.underline} [[subject
to **criticism**]{.underline}]{.mark} [and]{.underline}
**[interpretation]{.underline}** or the open ignorance [[of non-NATO
countries]{.underline}]{.mark}, especially those that consider the
Alliance as threat to their security. [**[Yet]{.underline}**
[participation in **norm creation**]{.underline}]{.mark} [that might be
binding for the entire]{.underline} [international society [will give
NATO]{.mark} **[significant political credit]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[when dealing with the cyber threat issue on a strategic level both
**[internally]{.mark}**]{.underline} [within the Alliance [and
**externally** with other]{.mark} international
[actors]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

Finally, there is a solution based on the worst-case scenario or casus
that is the creation of a normative regime as an outcome of a real life
situation, usually of catastrophic consequences. Despite the fact that
terrorism as a mode of irregular warfare has existed for long time, the
attacks on United States' soil on 11 September 2001 created a new and
much more effective international legal regime in dealing with the fight
against terrorist organizations in spheres that included the control of
money laundering and other financial activities aimed to support
terrorism, arms smuggling and illegal routes of arms export, the
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and finally, the
cooperation to trace and put on trial separate individuals and terrorist
organizations.236 Although effective in creating new norms that are
helping the international society in fighting against terrorism, [it
would]{.underline} still [be the **worst solution** for NATO
to]{.underline} [**evolve** a form of a legitimate regime against cyber
threats based on the]{.underline} **[catastrophic
consequences]{.underline}** [and sufferings of allied members'
populations and the destruction of critical infrastructure objects under
cyber-attacks.]{.underline}

C. CONCLUSIONS

[The North Atlantic Treaty is a universal legal document that may serve
as an appropriate instrument in the case that NATO faces an **imminent
cyber threat**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[subsequent
cyber-attack]{.underline}** [that may cause a **catastrophic** chain of
reactions in combination with other types of threats]{.underline},
[united in a **hybrid threat constellation**]{.underline} or separately
used to decapitate technologies or influence information space. [For
this reason, however, the Alliance must show itself as a **robust
organization**]{.underline} [that is able to provide **political
consensus**]{.underline} [when cyber threats are projected]{.underline}
against one or more NATO members. [One does not need to doubt the
outcomes when cyber threats emerge again with similar situations when
compared to **Estonia** in 2007 or in NATO's partner state **Georgia**
in 2008.]{.underline}

Nevertheless, [the Alliance would feel much more comfortable if cyber
threats are **regulated** under a **collective security
shield**]{.underline} and an established international regime that is
founded upon the basis of a treaty ratified by the majority. The
[**current international norms** that regulate questions about
**collective security**]{.underline}, rights for
**[self-defense]{.underline}**, **[jus ad bellum]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[jus in bello]{.underline}** [are]{.underline}
**[obsolete]{.underline}** [because they have been created]{.underline}
in order [to regulate **kinetic conflicts**]{.underline} [not **cyber
space**]{.underline}, [which was just **science fiction**]{.underline}
[at the time when documents such as the Geneva Conventions or the UN
Charter were created]{.underline}. [Therefore[, there is **space to
maneuver** for]{.mark}]{.underline} [those state and non-state
[actors]{.mark} that are [developing]{.mark} [cyber]{.mark} warfare
[capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}[---]{.mark}[not only for defense
purpose but also [for **offensive objectives**]{.mark}]{.underline}---
[[because]{.mark} [existing]{.mark} international [law
allows]{.mark}]{.underline} [[a **wide
interpretation**]{.underline}]{.mark} [regarding what might be
considered a **cyber-attack**]{.underline} [and what kind of defense
states]{.underline} [are authorized to realize]{.underline}. [This
leaves **NATO**,]{.underline} [as an organization created **on the basis
of international law**]{.underline}, [with]{.underline} **[challenging
conditions]{.underline}** [in which it has to **seek its own
solutions**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[legitimation]{.underline}** [for taking a **justified
response**]{.underline} [against]{.underline} those that project [cyber
threats]{.underline} against the Alliance.

[In this regard, NATO is **forced**]{.underline} [to take action and
create a **cyber-defense doctrine**]{.underline} [that includes all
possible kinds of responses]{.underline}. The New Strategic Concept gave
political authorization for allied cooperation, strategic commands
together with member nations are institutions that provide control and
resources, and the center of excellence is a think tank that is seeking
applicable solutions for both the Alliance's needs and those of NATO's
partners. This combination [[makes NATO a crucial
actor]{.underline},]{.mark} [not only at national and regional levels
but also [at an **international level**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}[when dealing with the cyber threats issue]{.underline}.
[[NATO]{.mark}'s interest in [finding **solutions**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[for]{.mark} **cooperative [cyber defense]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[gives]{.underline} [**added value** to]{.underline}
[the]{.underline}]{.mark} **[whole [international
system]{.mark}]{.underline}** and does not exclude the possibility that
[[NATO will be the **founding organization**]{.underline} [to create
**new norms**]{.underline} **[acceptable to
everyone]{.underline}**.]{.mark}

[It is still [**hard to predict** **exactly** what]{.mark} kind of cyber
[threats might be considered]{.mark} as [NATO's **jus ad
bellum**]{.mark} [because **each case is unique**]{.mark} and scenarios
in which cyber threats might emerge are **complicated**, not only from a
**legal aspect** but also from **political**, **diplomatic**, and
**technological** aspects]{.underline} as well.
[**[Nevertheless]{.underline}**, [NATO must]{.underline}]{.mark}
[continue its work in [seek]{.mark}ing the **[best
methods]{.mark}**]{.underline} to defend against cyber threats.
[Otherwise the Alliance might experience a repetition of a **cyber
9/11**]{.underline} and subsequent improvements in cyber threats at all
levels, [which will undermine the **spirit** and]{.underline}
**[letter]{.underline}** [of the North Atlantic Treaty as well as
**question the legitimacy of the Alliance itself.**]{.underline}

[The **legal challenges**]{.underline} [that hybrid threats present for
collective security guarantees have been recognized]{.underline} at the
highest political level. [At their Warsaw summit held in July 2016,
[NATO]{.mark}'s member states [confirmed]{.mark}]{.underline} their
[readiness to assist each other at any stage of a hybrid campaign and to
counter hybrid warfare]{.underline} as part of collective defense.294
[They]{.underline} also [underscored]{.underline} that the
[[N]{.mark}orth [A]{.mark}tlantic [C]{.mark}ouncil "[could]{.mark}
decide to **[invoke Article 5]{.mark}**]{.underline} of the Washington
Treaty."295 They repeated these points at their Brussels summit in July
2018.296 [[By]{.mark} [drawing a]{.mark}n **express [link]{.mark}**
[between **hybrid war**]{.mark}**fare** [and]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[collective defense]{.underline}**]{.mark}, [[NATO]{.mark} leaders
**[signaled]{.mark} their [resolve]{.mark}** []{.mark}not to allow
Article 5 to be **hollowed out**]{.underline}.297 [Still]{.underline},
[their declarations of **intent** strike a rather]{.underline}
**[conservative note.]{.underline}** Whilst they accept that NATO may
assist an Ally at any stage of a "hybrid campaign," it is only in cases
of "hybrid warfare" that they foresee a potential role for Article 5.
This is not an unreasonable position to take. As we saw earlier,
[recourse to the [use of force to counter]{.mark} [hybrid threats
falling **below**]{.mark} **the threshold of [an armed
attack]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[is neither
**permissible**]{.underline}]{.mark} [n[or]{.mark}]{.underline}
necessarily **[[appropriate]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [A [pledge to
invoke]{.mark} the mutual defense [commitment in response to
**every**]{.mark} **type of [hybrid threat]{.mark}** [would]{.mark} be a
promise to **[use the]{.mark} proverbial [sledgehammer to crack a
nut]{.mark}.** It would be **unrealistic** and therefore **lack
credibility** in the eyes of hybrid **adversaries**]{.underline}.298 [By
accepting that the role of Article 5 is **confined** to situations of
hybrid warfare, the]{.underline} [Warsaw and Brussels Summit
Declarations]{.underline} [avoid]{.underline} such **[empty
gestures]{.underline}**. [However]{.underline}, in the same breath [they
also concede that the application of Article 5 is contingent
on]{.underline} [the legal threshold between warfare and peace, and thus
**vulnerable to subversion**]{.underline} along the lines discussed in
the preceding sections.

[It may be tempting to deal with the problem of legal thresholds by
**attempting to escape them**]{.underline} [altogether]{.underline},
[but **this is not a feasible strategy**]{.underline}. [Even if the
contracting parties were to **revise Article 5** NAT]{.underline} and
Article 42(7) TEU [to avoid references to "armed attack" and "armed
aggression,"]{.underline}299 [they would remain bound by the rules
governing the use of force under the UN Charter and customary
international law]{.underline}. Although the member states of NATO and
the EU make up an influential part of the international community, it is
not within their ability to adjust these general rules of international
law unilaterally. In any event, [**[lowering]{.mark} the [threshold
for]{.mark} the use of [force]{.mark}** in order [to
**facilitate**]{.mark} **the [application of Article
5]{.mark}**]{.underline} and Article 42(7) [[would]{.mark} **come with
significant costs**]{.underline}, [since it would **[loosen]{.mark} the
[legal restrictions for all states,]{.mark}**]{.underline} **[including
hostile powers]{.underline}**. [The applicable thresholds therefore
**cannot be unilaterally modified at will**]{.underline} and [without
the [risk]{.mark} [of **unraveling**]{.mark} **key elements of [the
international legal order]{.mark}**]{.underline} as it currently stands.

[A [more **promising approach** is to **strengthen legal
interoperability**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[among
NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} and EU [nations]{.underline}. [One line of
effort is to **[reduce legal gray zones]{.mark}**]{.underline},300 for
example [[by **narrowing disagreements**]{.mark} over the gap that lies
between the definition of force and armed attack]{.underline}. [This
could prepare the ground for [develop]{.mark}ing [a]{.mark} **[shared
understanding]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[of **what**]{.mark} **kind of
[hybrid threats]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[may trigger]{.mark} the
applicability of [Article 5]{.mark} NAT]{.underline} and Article 42(7)
TEU. Given that the assessment of any security threat depends heavily on
its context, it may prove somewhat sterile to build such a consensus in
the abstract. Drawing on war-gaming and exercises may offer a more
fruitful way forward. Bearing in mind how attractive the use of proxies
is to a hybrid state adversary,301 developing a common approach to
attribute their activities to the sponsoring state also merits
attention. Although many aspects of the rules governing the attribution
of wrongful acts are settled, certain questions could benefit from a
joint posture.302 NATO and EU nations should also strengthen their
collective mechanisms for unmasking attempts at plausible deniability in
order to deny its use as a hybrid instrument,303 as illustrated by their
united response to the Skripal incident and to Russian cyber
operations.304

Additionally, [a [unified offensive cyber]{.mark}]{.underline} C2
[[structure would]{.mark} aid scenario planning and [speed up
decision-making]{.mark}.]{.underline} This is important, because [[NATO
needs to streamline its]{.mark} current [decision-making]{.mark} process
[in]{.mark} the [cyber]{.mark} domain.]{.underline}115 [A single command
would help members agree on appropriate forms of retaliation in
cyberspace in different scenarios, bolstering the credibility of
deterrence]{.underline}-bypunishment even further. [Without a clear
command structure, it is very difficult for]{.underline} the 30 [NATO
allies -- who have different threat perceptions and suffer from a lack
of cohesion -- to agree on effective response scenarios in contingency
planning.]{.underline}116 As a case in point, [Estonia is willing to
strike back when attacked online]{.underline}, given its memory of the
2007 attack and its proximity to Russia.117 [However, Estonian officials
do not know whether other allies will support them,
validating]{.underline} some scholars' [arguments that NATO needs to
find common ground in cyber contingency planning.]{.underline}118 The
secrecy that shrouds allies' capabilities and the uncertainty
surrounding cyber scenario planning might explain why offensive cyber
effects do not feature in NATO's mission planning process.119 [**[This
is not to say]{.mark} that [NATO needs to publicly agree on a 'red
line']{.mark} in cyberspace [that could trigger]{.mark} an [Article
5]{.mark} response.** If anything, NATO's current **strategic ambiguity
is key for deterring attacks that fall just below a defined
threshold**.]{.underline}120 [However, [unifying cyber]{.mark} C2 [would
help]{.mark} them carry out scenario [planning **behind closed
doors**]{.mark}, improving the Alliance's readiness. [Speeding up the
decision-making process is crucial given how long it can take to]{.mark}
attribute and then [launch a retaliatory attack]{.mark}.]{.underline}121
Overall, [streamlined scenario planning and decisionmaking, augmented by
[improved coordination]{.mark} of cyberattacks, [would
**strengthen**]{.mark} **the credibility of
[deterrence]{.mark}**]{.underline}-by-punishment. [Al[though
aggressors]{.mark}]{.underline} like Fancy Bear [[would not know when
a]{.mark} certain [threshold has been crossed, it would tilt]{.mark}
[their]{.mark} risk-benefit [calculus knowing an attack could trigger a
faster]{.mark}, well-coordinated [retal]{.mark}iatory
attack.]{.underline}
