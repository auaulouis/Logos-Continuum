space in order to hedge its bets, as Rees and Hawking both rightly
advise, a gamma-ray burst in our galactic vicinity would still wipe us
all out. Such an event is thousands of times rarer than an asteroid
collision, but when it does finally happen **[we shall have no

The Ukraine war has resurrected the utterly chilling prospect [of
potential nuclear war]{.underline}---and with it the [end]{.underline}
of [humanity]{.underline}. Scorched flesh, vaporised bodies, and
exploding lungs would be the immediate results. The long-term ones would
be even more catastrophic. Yet most commentators and politicians calmly
discuss this as just the geopolitics of escalation rather than a threat
that should lead to revolt to stop it. [[Nuc]{.mark}lear
[war]{.mark}]{.underline} between the United States and Russia or
between the United States and China, [would mean death for hundreds of
millions immediately. But then it [would mean]{.mark} a climate disaster
known as **[nuclear winter]{.mark}.** As smoke from the blasted cities
rises into the atmosphere, [the **entire planet**]{.mark} **will soon be
[choked]{.mark}** [under]{.mark} dense clouds of [soot]{.mark}. This

that would [make **ag**]{.mark}**riculture [impossible]{.mark}** [and
**wipe out**]{.mark} **[the entire human race]{.mark}.**]{.underline}
Alan Robock, a climate researcher at Rutgers university, has been
studying nuclear weapons for 30 years. His team modelled a scenario of
"limited" war where two sides launched 100 bombs each. "There would be
between 16 and 37 million tons of carbon," Robock says. It would mean 50
to 125 million people dead in the first week. [[A reduction of]{.mark}
as much as **[35 ­percent]{.mark} in [sunlight]{.mark} reaching Earth's
surface.** That [means **worldwide famine for a decade**]{.mark}. The
road to nuclear war is prepared by the idea of "battlefield" nuclear
weapons and thermobaric ones]{.underline}. In 2017 the US military used
the biggest bomb since the nuclear destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki
at the end of the Second World War. The US unleashed the 22,000-pound
Massive Ordnance Air Blast Bomb in Afghanistan. It didn't lead to
worldwide condemnation. The world is awash with nuclear weapons. All
figures for nuclear weapons are estimates but, according to the
Federation of American Scientists, Russia has 5,977 nuclear
warheads---the devices that trigger a nuclear explosion. But this
includes about 1,500 that are so out of date they are set to be
dismantled. That leaves 4,500 or so. In ­contrast, the US has 5,428,
France 290 and Britain 225---with more to come. This gives a Nato total
of 5,943. Just because all sides of this conflict have nuclear weapons
doesn't mean they would shy away from using them. This line of thinking
is dangerous. Mutually assured destruction isn't off the cards, it's the
kind of barbarism that capitalism allows. At points the great powers
enter talks and negotiations which may seem to steer away from nuclear
war. But behind this face lies the brute possibility of actually using
their arsenals. [The Ukraine war reminds us that [this is one]{.mark} of
the [methods of **extinction**---together with recurring pandemics and

threatens.

Hopefully indeed. Research shows that [[even]{.mark} a **relatively
[small]{.mark}** [nuclear war]{.mark}]{.underline} involving 50 nuclear
weapons [[would toss]{.mark} **[11 billions]{.mark}
[lbs]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[of]{.mark} [soot]{.mark} into the

[would [cause]{.mark} **widespread crop failure** and attendant
**[famine]{.mark} for years**]{.underline} before the soot finally falls
out.

Up the number of nuclear weapons to around 100 Hiroshima-sized bombs,
and **[[society]{.mark} would [cease to exist]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
The [[survivors]{.mark} of such a catastrophic event would [face]{.mark}
a **[horrific]{.mark}**]{.underline}-[**[sounding]{.mark}** **[nuclear
famine]{.mark}**]{.underline}. That's according to a 2013 report, which
states that "the [primary mechanisms for **human fatalities** would
likely]{.underline} not [be]{.underline} from blast effects, not from
thermal radiation burns, and not from ionizing radiation, but, rather,
[from **mass starvation**]{.underline}."

The report shows that 2.3 billion people would face starvation, and
[**[ecosystems]{.mark}** around the world [would]{.mark} **wither** and
**[die]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In other words, **[that'd be
it]{.underline}**. ***No more dick jokes***. No more worrying about
climate change. **[No more nothing]{.underline}**.

That's why what journalist Jonathan Schell wrote about nuclear holocaust
in The New Yorker in 1982 still rings as true today as ever:

"To employ a mathematical analogy, we can say that although the risk of
extinction may be fractional, [the **[stake is]{.mark}**]{.underline},
humanly speaking, **[[infinite]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and a
[**fraction** of infinity is **still infinity**]{.underline}. In other
words, once we learn that a holocaust might lead to extinction [[we

[developed]{.mark} as a way [to improve]{.mark} the
[survivability]{.mark}]{.underline} of shallow bunkers since shallow
bunkers are cheaper to build than deeper ones. To attain greater
survivability, an outer bunker is made in the form of a sphere. This
sphere is placed inside a shallow circular shaft. Shock absorbers are
placed around the sphere connecting into an internal bunker. Those
absorbers cushion the occupants from the shock waves of a nuclear
explosion. [Other bunkers that use similar technology]{.underline} in

AI has been the subject of countless popular TV shows and movies over
the years-just not in a relatively positive way. [In]{.underline} these
[shows, it always seems like artificial intelligence will decide to
completely wipe out humanity]{.underline} and civilization from
existence. It\'s a bleak \"prediction,\" but does it actually have any
basis in reality?

According to several scientists, **[the feared [dangers of AI
aren\'t]{.mark} much of [an existential threat]{.mark} to humanity as a
whole]{.underline}**. [And [that depends on]{.mark} one thing: [whether
it is even possible]{.mark} for us [to create a]{.mark}rtificial
[i]{.mark}ntelligence way [smarter than we are]{.mark}]{.underline},
writes ScienceAlert.

[Current-Gen AI Is]{.underline} Still [Pretty \'Weak\']{.underline}

[The AI that exists]{.underline} right now [is pretty
powerful]{.underline} in its own right. It is what\'s being used for
things like self-driving cars, facial recognition software, and even
Google recommendations. [But]{.underline} the thing with [[current-gen
AI]{.mark} is that it\'s considered \"narrow\" or \"weak.\"]{.underline}

While this kind of artificial intelligence is already quite good,
**[they\'re often [only capable of doing one thing]{.mark}
exceptionally]{.underline}**, according to LabRoots. [[If you try to
make them do something else]{.underline}]{.mark} while doing something
they\'re good at, [these AIs will fail because **[they lack the]{.mark}
necessary [data to perform it]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

[Current-generation artificial intelligence still falls short of tasks
that will always require abilities that only humans
possess]{.underline}, writes Forbes. For instance, experienced surgeons
are still the best choice for performing surgeries, with their fine
motor skills and skill at perceiving individual situations.

You also can\'t use an AI to replace HR professionals, because the job
will require a deep, intrinsic understanding of human reactions that a
machine just doesn\'t have, no matter how \"advanced\" it might be. It
is these kinds of situations where combining machine and human
intelligence still reigns supreme. The human element provides the
machine with the necessary context, while the latter is put to work
crunching numbers and giving recommendations.

Machines Are Just Called \'Intelligent\' For Their Ability To Learn

In an article by The Conversation, they put this specific argument
forward. [[A machine can always \"learn\" if it is fed data]{.mark}
about the task it\'s meant to achieve]{.underline}. Sure, it can process
information much faster than a human can (and perhaps even come up with
solutions no person can ever think of), [[but it doesn\'t make the
machine smart]{.mark}er than a human at all.]{.underline}

Here\'s one situation where machine learning is still way behind human
learning. Take [a toddler]{.underline}, for instance. That child [can
learn how to do a specific task within seconds just by watching somebody
do it. [A machine can only learn something if it is fed an **extremely
massive amount of data**]{.mark}, which it uses when performing
trial-and-error]{.underline} according to Synthesys.

To get a more accurate assessment of the opinion of leading researchers
in the field, I turned to the [Fellows of the American Association for
Artificial Intelligence]{.underline}, a group of researchers who are
recognized as having made significant, sustained contributions to the
field.

In early March 2016, AAAI [sent out an anonymous survey]{.underline} on
my behalf, posing the following question to 193 fellows:

"In his book, Nick Bostrom has defined Superintelligence as 'an
intellect that is much smarter than the best human brains in practically
every field, including scientific creativity, general wisdom and social
skills.' [When do you think we will achieve
Superintelligence?"]{.underline}

Over the next week or so, [[80 fellows]{.mark} responded]{.underline} (a
41 percent response rate), and their responses are summarized below:

In essence, [[according to 92]{.mark}.5 [percent]{.mark}]{.underline} of
the respondents, [[superintelligence is]{.underline} **[beyond the
foreseeable horizon]{.underline}**]{.mark}. [[This
interp]{.mark}retation [is]{.mark}]{.underline} also
**[[supported]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[by]{.mark} written comments
shared by [the fellows]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Even though the survey was anonymous, 44 fellows chose to identify
themselves, including Geoff Hinton (deep-learning luminary), Ed
Feigenbaum (Stanford, Turing Award winner), Rodney Brooks (leading
roboticist), and Peter Norvig (Google).

The respondents also shared several comments, including the following:

"[Way, way, way more than 25 years]{.underline}. **[[Centuries most
likely]{.underline}]{.mark}**. But not never."

"[We're [competing with]{.mark} **[millions of years' evolution of the
human brain]{.mark}**]{.underline}. We can write single-purpose programs
that can compete with humans, and sometimes excel, but the world is not
neatly compartmentalized into single-problem questions."

"Nick **[Bostrom is]{.underline}** a professional scare monger. His
Institute's role is to find existential threats to humanity. He sees
them everywhere. I am tempted to refer to him as **[the]{.underline}**
'**[Donald Trump']{.underline}** **[of AI.]{.underline}**"

[Surveys]{.underline} do, of course, have limited scientific value. They
are notoriously sensitive to question phrasing, selection of
respondents, etc. However, [it is the one source of data that Bostrom
himself turned to]{.underline}.

Another methodology would be to extrapolate from the current state of AI
to the future. However, this is difficult because we do not have a
quantitative measurement of the current state of human-level
intelligence. We have achieved superintelligence in board games like
chess and Go (see "Google's AI Masters Go a Decade Earlier than
Expected"), and yet our programs failed to score above 60 percent on
eighth grade science tests, as the Allen Institute's research has shown
(see "The Best AI Program Still Flunks an Eighth Grade Science Test"),
or above 48 percent in disambiguating simple sentences (see "Tougher
Turing Test Exposes Chatbots' Stupidity").

[There are many valid concerns about AI]{.underline}, from its impact on
jobs to its uses in autonomous weapons systems and even to the potential
risk of superintelligence. However, [[predictions]{.mark} that
[superintelligence is on the]{.mark} foreseeable [horizon **are not
supported**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[by]{.mark} the available
[data]{.mark}]{.underline}. Moreover, [[doom-and-gloom
predictions]{.mark} often **[fail to consider]{.mark} the potential
[benefits]{.mark}** of AI in]{.underline} [preventing medical errors,
reducing car accidents, and more]{.underline}.

Finally, [[it's possible]{.mark} that [AI]{.mark} systems [could]{.mark}
collaborate with people to [create a **symbiotic
superintelligence**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [That would be very different
from the pernicious and autonomous kind envisioned by]{.underline}
Professor [Bostrom]{.underline}.

Emerging technologies as an Earth system

The first question to ask about emerging technologies is deceptively
simple: Is today really that different? Is there something about today's
emerging technologies---which for purposes of this analysis include
nanotechnology, biotechnology, information and communication technology
(ICT), robotics, applied cognitive science, humtech (design and
engineering of the human as a foundational emerging technology), and
their various combinations and permutations---that is qualitatively
different from those that characterized other eras of technological
change? If there isn't, much of today's dramatic language can be
understood as simply a reflection of the emphasis that all humans give
to the particular era and landscape and culture within which they exist.
[[Each generation]{.underline}]{.mark} tends to [**overemphasize**
the]{.underline} degree of [change]{.underline} that [it
experiences]{.underline}, partly [because of]{.underline} the
**[immediacy]{.underline}** of the stresses to which it is exposed, and
partly because it is easy to underestimate how difficult and
unpredictable life was in the past, since when one looks back at history
it seems to flow logically and necessarily. Indeed, [**apocalyptic
[fears]{.mark}** have been **[common]{.mark}**]{.underline} when many
major technology systems first emerged [[because of]{.underline}]{.mark}
this [**[immediacy]{.mark}**, even as subsequent
[generations]{.mark}]{.underline} grew to [[view]{.mark} the
[tech]{.mark}nology [as **banal**]{.mark}**, even boring**. [In]{.mark}
the]{.underline} early days of [[railroads]{.underline}]{.mark}, for
example, [[there was]{.mark} a widespread [belief]{.mark}]{.underline}
that [traveling at the]{.underline} heretofore [**unimaginable speed of
[25 m]{.mark}iles [p]{.mark}er [h]{.mark}our** [would **kill**]{.mark}
the [passengers]{.mark}]{.underline}, in part [because such]{.underline}
technology [was against **the obvious will of God**]{.underline}. As an
Ohio school board put it,

If God had designed that His intelligent creatures should travel at the
frightful speed of [15 miles an hour]{.underline} by steam, He would
have foretold it through His holy prophets. It [is **[a device of
Satan]{.mark}**]{.underline} to lead immortal souls down to Hell. (Nye,
1994: 57)3

In this case, however, a strong argument can be made that emerging
technologies today are different not just in degree, but in kind, from
those of the past. To begin with, the scope, scale, and speed of
technological change are unprecedented. Where previous waves of
technological change have involved a few core technologies, such as
railroads or electrification, today technological evolution is occurring
across the entire technological frontier. Partially as a result of such
technologies rippling across a population of seven billion people, we
now live on a terraformed planet, the first world we know of anywhere
that has been shaped by the deliberate activities of a single species.
That is not a discontinuous process, but it is qualitatively new.

Moreover, as the discussion of the engineered warrior of 2050 suggests,
the human itself has become a design space. [It is]{.underline}
certainly true that people have always changed themselves in many ways,
from consuming intoxicants of all kinds, to medicine, to education, but
there is little question that the direct interventions that are now
possible, combined with accelerating advances in fields such as
neuroscience, genetics and molecular biology, and prosthetics, make
virtually all aspects of the human, including cognitive and
psychological domains, potentially subject to design. That the designer
is not just engineering external systems, but him- or herself, adds a
degree of reflexivity, nonlinearity, and complexity that makes simple
predictions about particular technologies tangential and irrelevant at
best.

It is worth emphasizing in passing that [the [argument]{.mark} that
humans are at risk from emerging technologies [is]{.mark}]{.underline}
in an important sense **[[circular]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Humans are
increasingly both designer and designed; they are, in other words,
increasingly an emerging technology in their own right. People are many
things, but they are now, and certainly will be in the future, a design
project. Thus, in a meaningful way the argument that people are at risk
from emerging technologies becomes the argument that emerging
technologies are at risk from emerging technologies, which makes little
sense, and isn't very helpful analytically, or in guiding policy or
practice.

24.3 Arguments against the Simulation Hypothesis

The principal arguments against a simulation hypothesis are moral and
ethical. [[If we were capable of running a simulation]{.mark}
with]{.underline} **[fully sentient beings]{.underline}**
[contained]{.underline} **[within]{.underline}**, then [the]{.underline}
**[[termination]{.underline}]{.mark}** [of such a simulation, resulting
in]{.underline} **[death]{.underline}** of the contained sapients,
[[must be considered]{.mark} as an act of]{.underline} **[mass murder or
[genocide]{.mark}]{.underline}**. One could imagine a proscription
against running sufficiently advanced simulations for this very reason.
Creating an advanced simulation is perhaps the very definition of
playing God. and creators have a moral duty to their creation. Even if
their creation never produces sentience, we understand as humans that
animal cruelty is also morally wrong.

In other words, [as soon as an advanced simulation is instantiated, it
should never be ceased, and provisions must be made for this simulation
to be **run indefinitely**. [Future civilisations **with this
tenet**]{.mark} in their moral code [**must therefore**
be]{.mark}]{.underline} [[willing to expend]{.mark} an effectively
**[infinite]{.mark}** amount of **[resources]{.mark}**, which
is]{.underline} **[[clearly unfavourable]{.underline}]{.mark}** from a
thermodynamic standpoint. It could **[[therefore]{.underline}]{.mark}**
be argued that [**[ancestor-simulations will never be run]{.mark}**,
invoking this mix of economic and moral objections as
cause]{.underline}.

2.3. A global catastrophe in the simulation

[[A simulation]{.mark} which is **[modeling a]{.mark} global
[catastrophe]{.mark}**]{.underline} is not the same that a terminating
simulation from formal point of view, but doesn't have much difference
for the simulation inhabitants. [There are]{.underline} **[several
overlapping reasons]{.underline}** [why [we]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[[could be located in such]{.mark} type of simulation:]{.underline}**

[**[1)]{.underline}** [Fermi simulations]{.underline}]{.mark} [created
by alien AIs to solve the Fermi paradox are designed in the way that
they]{.underline} **[[should model the world in the vicinity
of]{.underline}]{.mark}** a **[global
[catastrophe]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

[**[2)]{.underline}** **[Singularity
simulations]{.underline}**]{.mark}[, or models of the first AI
appearing, [are modeling]{.mark} the **period of history**]{.underline}
[[when]{.underline}]{.mark} different [**global [risks peak]{.mark}**.
The period before creating]{.underline} of [AGI is also a period of
quick development of]{.underline} **[other]{.underline}** potentially
**[dangerous tech]{.underline}**nologies, [[like]{.underline}]{.mark}
synthetic biology (Millett & Snyder-Beattie, 2017; Turchin, Green, &
Denkenberger, 2017), colliders (Kent, 2004), [**advance
[nuc]{.mark}**lear weapon**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline} etc. [The events
before singularity could **quickly accelerate**, driven by]{.underline}
**[arms races]{.underline}** and different instabilities. Singularity
simulations may also end up with unstable or evil AI which will cause an
observable catastrophe, like a paperclipper.

**[[3)]{.underline}]{.mark}** [Simulations as **[computer
games]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[**center**]{.mark}ed around
**[attempt]{.mark}**s [to **save the world**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

4\) Second leg of the Bostrom's argument: if we are not in the
simulation, it is best explained by the fact that there is some
universal reason for the civilizations' extinction.

Obviously, alien AGI will be also interested in outcomes of the attempts
of AGI creation of different planets, so there is no practical
difference between Fermi simulations by alien AGI and ancestral
Singularity simulations by our own superintelligent AI.

2.4. Doomsday Argument for simulations predicts termination soon

The DA and SA do not cancel each other, as was assumed by Aranyosi
(Aranyosi, 2004), but are actually supporting. Combined, they claim: "A
conscious observer is most likely in a simulation, and it will probably
end soon". The reason for this is that the DA logic should be applied
only to the duration of the simulation, but not to the number of
observers in all real and simulated worlds, as observer birth rank is
known and ordered only inside any given simulation. While the birth
order in the simulation could be faked by creators, it make the DA
inside the simulation even stronger: if the simulation was created --
with all false memories -- just yesterday, it will most likely will end
tomorrow.

Thus, Doomsday argument for simulations runs as following: using the
Copernican mediocrity principle (Gott, 1999), an observer can suggest
that the observer is located somewhere in the middle of the duration of
his-her simulation, as his-her moment now is randomly chosen from the
whole duration of the simulation. This means that if the median total
duration of the simulation duration is T, when it will likely end in T/2
from now.

Perhaps one's simulation was created just yesterday with all his-her
memories? It means even shorter duration of the simulation thus making
DA in simulation even stronger. But to have all the memories in order,
these memories should be simulated for some period of time, so the idea
of the simulation with false memories appears to be self-defeating as it
assumes the existence of another simulation which prepared these false
memories. However, these false memories could be prepared once for many
short runs, the same way as false memories were prepared for characters
of the TV-series Westworld, where each short run of a character was only
one day, after which she was reloaded with the same old memories.

Anyway, T cannot be very short, or much more complex structure of the
nested simulation is needed to describe appearance of the false
memories. For Fermi simulations, it is probably reasonable to simulate
human history between the beginning of the 20th century and the
Singularity, which is approximately 150 years, as during this period
most critical choices were made.

Moreover, simulation argument itself predicts shorter simulations. As we
discuss above, simpler simulations should numerically dominate. This
also means that shorter duration of internal time simulations also
should numerically dominate: that is, the simulations which simulate
only one human's life are more numerous than simulations which simulate
whole the

human history for 5000 years, and billion years old simulations are
extremely rare.

Lewis also compared SA and DA (Lewis, 2013), and finds that SA works,
but DA doesn't. However, he did not analyze the simple Gott's DA, and
instead used the Sleeping Beauty model for his analysis, and did not
apply the DA to an observer inside the simulation.

2.5. Immortality in simulations

Existence of an extremely large number of simulations created by many
different civilizations in a potentially infinite universe implies that
there are other copies of each person in different simulations. There is
a very large but finite number of possible people, limited by different
combinations of atoms, and if the number of the simulations is larger
than the number of possible people, people will repeat in the
simulations.

Moreover, if humanity is located in an ancestral simulation, it will
likely be run many times with small variations (according to the
assumptions of SA), and thus many of its elements will be repeated
exactly or with small variations, including human beings.

Thus, if one's simulation were turned off, other simulations with other
copies would continue to exist and this could be a form of immortality.
For example, if there are 10 exact copies of oneself in different
simulations, and 9 of the simulations are terminated, one copy will
survive, which may or may not be interpreted as some form of immortality
depending on how one treats personal identity and measure, see (Turchin,
2018a).

If one were an avatar of some gamer, the end of the simulation would
look like the awakening for that avatar in the body of gamer, and
merging of memories of the gamer and the avatar's experiences in the
simulation. This is analogous to the way that one's memories about a
dream merge with real life after awakening.

Conclusion

[Humanity's [location at the]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[beginning of the
21st century]{.underline}** [could be]{.underline} **[best
explained]{.underline}** [by]{.underline}]{.mark} [the fact that this
period is **in [a scientific Fermi simulation]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[by an]{.underline} **[alien civilization or future humanity-based
AGI]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[simulating variants of its own
origin]{.underline}**, which could be called a "singularity simulation".
[This means that humanity could be]{.underline} **[tested]{.underline}**
[for]{.underline} **[different]{.underline}** scenarios of **[global
catastrophic risks]{.underline}**, and no matter what the result of the
test is, the simulation of us would be turned off relatively soon, in
tens to hundreds of years from now.

5\) [**[Simulation awareness]{.mark}**. The beings
**inside**]{.underline} the simulation [start to]{.underline}
**[realize]{.underline}** that [they are in a simulation, so it
is]{.underline} **[not a simulation anymore]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[cannot be used as such]{.underline}**. Pure
philosophizing about being in a simulation would likely not be enough to
cause termination, as such theorizing it is likely inevitable. However,
observing some undeniable glitches [[would]{.underline} **[destroy the
purpose]{.underline}**]{.mark} [of the simulation as an]{.underline}
**[illusion of reality]{.underline}**, unless the simulation is rewound
and corrected.

6\) Game over. The simulation finally solves the unknown-to-humanity
task, and [there is]{.underline} **[no need]{.underline}**
[to]{.underline} **[run the simulation any more]{.underline}**. Most
tasks do not require a simulation to run until the heat death of the
universe, so simulations would typically have shorter duration than real
life. Even movies, games and dreams typically have short duration
compared with the duration of human life. However, some simulations may
run very long in internal life, like the Civilization game.

7\) Accidental termination. Some events in the "real world" terminate
the simulation. A person could wake from a dream if her alarm rings. A
computer could experience a power outage.

8\) Termination accumulation the nested simulation. Higher-level
simulation (closer to the actual reality) in nested simulations turns
off. Interestingly, nested simulations are not dominant in our world
currently, i.e., one is not often dreaming about seeing a movie in which
one is writing a book about a computer gamer. Most human-created
simulations are one level, and it is exactly what one should expect from
the idea of domination of computationally inexpensive simulations.
Multilevel simulation is inherently complex. It means that the possible
simulation of humanity would be likely terminated before it would be
capable of generating many multilevel simulations, that is shortly after
the appearance of superintelligent AI, as was mentioned by Bostrom and
Greene (Bostrom, 2003; Greene, 2018).

9\) Natural end. A simulation will probably be terminated after all
beings in it have died or all natural processes have stopped.

10\) Unknown threshold. The simulation of humanity could pass an unknown
threshold after which it must be terminated. As humanity is now alive
such threshold, if it exists, is ahead of us. The threshold could not
only be AGI creation, but some moral threshold, such as a large
population, intense suffering, or sentient computers. Alternatively, the
threshold could be technological, such as self-replicating
nanotechnology or genetically engineered babies or philosophical, like
the capability of thinking about being in a simulation clearly. Given
the accelerated rate of progress, such thresholds will probably happen
almost simultaneously in historical time, probably somewhere in the 21st
century. Other thresholds could be more remote, like star-travel or
destroying life on Mars (as it could be taken as an evidence of our
hostile nature) or colonizing the galaxy.

Robin Hanson recommended acting in a way that will make one's simulation
more interesting to the possible hosts thus lowering chances of the
simulation termination: "If you might be living in a simulation then all
else equal you should care less about others, live more for today, make
your world look more likely to become rich, expect to and try more to
participate in pivotal events, be more entertaining and praiseworthy,
and keep the famous people around you happier and more interested in
you" (Hanson, 2001).

On the other hand, [[even]{.underline} **[discussing
simulations]{.underline}** [maybe an]{.underline} **[informational
hazard]{.underline}** [as it]{.underline}]{.mark} [could]{.underline}
**[[increase chances]{.mark} that [the simulation will be
terminated]{.mark}]{.underline}**. However, as [the topic]{.underline}
**[has been discussed]{.underline}** for \~20 years without the
simulation's termination, this is evidence for the host's tolerance to
the simulation awareness. [This evidence maybe]{.underline} **[rather
weak]{.underline}** [given]{.underline} [**observational selection
effects**: even if most self-aware simulations were terminated, we could
find ourselves only **where the termination threshold is higher than
zero-tolerance**]{.underline}. However, it may not be possible to
simulate the 21st century without simulating some scientists who think
that they may be in a simulation. Hanson wrote that "simulations\...
tend to be ended when enough people in them become confident enough that
they live in a simulation" (Hanson, 2001). It appears that Bostrom did
not worry about his SA possibly causing simulation shutdown, and thus
being the ultimate hazardous information, though he wrote a lot about
information hazards in other domains (Bostrom, 2011).

That's the situation that Hawking is describing, and even though [the
[probability]{.mark} of that occurring [is **very, very
small**]{.mark}]{.underline}, it is possible, and --- if this is, in
fact, how our Universe looks --- it could literally happen at any given
time.

But is this the situation that does, in fact, describe our Universe?
[What would happen to our Universe if this tunneling to a lower-energy
state happened? Would it]{.underline}, in fact, [be destroyed? Or would
the changes that occur leave the Universe intact, if only a little
different than before?]{.underline}

[First off, [it's]{.mark} a **[very contentious]{.mark}** claim [to
say]{.mark} that the Higgs [field]{.mark} has [settled into]{.mark} a
[metastable]{.mark} state. While our best calculations say that the
Higgs may become unstable at energies in excess of 10\^11
GeV]{.underline} (where a GeV is the amount of energy required to
accelerate an electron from rest to a potential of one billion Volts),
[those are based on mass [measurements]{.mark} of bosons such as the
Higgs, W-boson as well as the top quark, that still [have **significant
uncertainties**]{.mark} on them. [Within]{.mark} the measurement
[uncertainty]{.mark}, the [Higgs **may**]{.mark} **yet turn out to
[be]{.mark} truly [stable]{.mark}**, meaning that we **already** may be
in the lowest part of the valley. In addition, [there are **strong
reasons** to believe]{.mark} that the [theory]{.mark} of asymptotic
safety [describes **gravity**, and]{.mark} therefore [predicts a
value]{.mark} for the Higgs mass that's **[perfectly
stable]{.mark}**,]{.underline} and consistent with what we observe.
[[If]{.mark} this is [the case]{.mark}, then the Higgs **isn't
metastable**, and [the]{.mark} whole [issue is
**moot**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Second off, what would happen [if]{.mark} this scenario were
[true]{.mark}, and some place in the Universe made the transition to a
more stable state? [It would]{.mark} be most likely to [happen
not]{.mark} here [on Earth]{.mark}, **nor even in our high-energy
particle colliders**, [but near a **supernova**]{.mark}, **hypernova**,
**active galactic nucleus** [or]{.mark} supermassive **[black
hole]{.mark}**. It's the highest energy [locations]{.mark} in the
Universe that are [**far more likely** to undergo]{.mark} this quantum
[transition, where energies]{.mark} of approximately 10\^10 GeV and
above [are **routine**]{.mark}ly achieved]{.underline}. For comparison,
[the highest energies achieved at the LHC are only around 10\^4 GeV,
which means the [odds of]{.mark} the [transition]{.mark} happening [by
us are **far lower**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[If the transition happened, the laws of [physics would]{.mark}
instantly [change]{.mark}]{.underline}, with properties like the masses
of particles, the strength of interactions and the sizes of atoms
changing instantaneously where the Higgs field achieved this lower
value. In addition, the lower value of the Higgs field would begin to
take over the Universe, with the transition propagating outward at the
speed of light. This is both good and bad for us. It's bad because we'd
never be able to see it coming; all the observable signals of the
Universe propagate no faster than the speed of light in vacuum, and so
if the transition is propagating at that speed, we'd have no signal of
it before it was on top of us. But it's also good, [[because the
Universe is accelerating]{.mark} in its expansion]{.underline}, meaning
that --- [[for 97%]{.mark} of the observable Universe --- [a
signal]{.mark} propagating [at the speed of light will **never reach**
us]{.mark}. So **[even if]{.mark} the [transition happens]{.mark}**
somewhere in our Universe, [it's **unlikely to affect
us**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

**The vacuum is [fully stable]{.underline}**

\--high energy events like cosmic ray collisions and the big bang should
create energies high enough to cause a transition, but haven't

\--it's more likely that we don't fully understand the vacuum than it's
metastable

\--there are clear gaps in human knowledge like quantum gravity and dark
matter that will change our understanding of physics

\--even if they're right, no collapse for billions of years

the Universe", Popular Mechanics, 9-10,
https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a11217/what-stephen-hawking-really-said-about-destroying-the-universe-17192502/

In July 2012, when scientists at CERN\'s Large Hadron Collider
culminated decades of work with their discovery of the Higgs boson, most
physicists celebrated. Stephen Hawking did not. The famed theorist
expressed his disappointment that nothing more unusual was found,
calling the discovery \"a pity in a way.\" But [did he]{.underline} ever
[say the Higgs could destroy the universe?]{.underline}

That\'s what many reports in the media said earlier this week, quoting a
preface Hawking wrote to a book called Starmus. According to The
Australian, the preface reads in part: \"The Higgs potential has the
worrisome feature that it might become metastable at energies above 100
\[billion\] gigaelectronvolts (GeV). This could mean that [the [universe
could undergo]{.mark} catastrophic [vacuum decay]{.mark}, with a
bubble]{.underline} of the true vacuum [expanding at the speed of
light]{.underline}. This could happen at any time and we wouldn\'t see
it coming.\"

What Hawking is talking about here is not the Higgs boson but what\'s
called the Higgs potential, which are \"totally different concepts,\"
says Katie Mack, a theoretical astrophysicist at Melbourne University.
The Higgs field permeates the entire universe, and the Higgs boson is an
excitation of that field, just like an electron is an excitation of an
electric field. In this analogy, the Higgs potential is like the
voltage, determining the value of the field.

Once [physicists]{.underline} began to close in on the mass of the Higgs
boson, they [were able to work out the Higgs potential.
That]{.underline} value [seemed to reveal that the universe exists
in]{.underline} what\'s known as [a meta-stable vacuum state, or false
vacuum]{.underline}, a state that\'s stable for now but could slip into
the \"true\" vacuum at any time. This is the catastrophic vacuum decay
in Hawking\'s warning, though he is not the first to posit the idea.

Is he right?

\"[There are]{.underline} a couple of really [good reasons to think
**[that\'s not the end of the story]{.mark}**]{.underline},\" Mack says.
[[There are two ways]{.mark} for a meta-stable state to fall off into
the true vacuum---one classical way, and one quantum way. The
[first]{.mark} would occur via [a huge energy boost]{.mark}, the 100
billion GeVs Hawking mentions. [But]{.mark}]{.underline}, Mack says,
[[the universe **already** experienced]{.mark} such [high energies
during]{.mark} the period of inflation just after [the big bang]{.mark}.
Particles in [cosmic rays]{.mark} from space also [**regularly**
collide]{.mark} with these kinds of high energies, and **[yet the vacuum
hasn\'t collapsed]{.mark}** (otherwise, we wouldn\'t be
here).]{.underline}

[\"Imagine that somebody hands you a piece of paper and says, \'This
piece of paper has the potential to spontaneously combust,\' and so you
might be worried,\"]{.underline} Mack says. [\"But then they tell you 20
years ago it was in a furnace.\" If it didn\'t combust in the furnace,
it\'s not likely to combust sitting in your hand.]{.underline}

Of course, there\'s always the quantum world to consider, and that\'s
where things always get weirder. In the quantum world, where the
smallest of particles interact, it\'s possible for a particle on one
side of a barrier to suddenly appear on the other side of the barrier
without actually going through it, a phenomenon known as quantum
tunneling. If our universe was in fact in a meta-stable state, it could
quantum tunnel through the barrier to the vacuum on the other side with
no warning, destroying everything in an instant. And [while that is
theoretically possible, predictions show that if it were to happen,
**[it\'s not likely for billions]{.mark} of billions [of
years]{.mark}**]{.underline}. By then, the sun and Earth and you and I
and Stephen Hawking will be a distant memory, so it\'s probably not
worth losing sleep over it.

[What\'s [more likely]{.mark}]{.underline}, Mack says, [is that there
[is]{.mark} some **[new physics]{.mark}** not yet understood that
**[makes our vacuum stable]{.mark}**. Physicists know there are parts of
the model missing; [mysteries]{.mark} like quantum gravity and dark
matter that [still defy explanation]{.mark}. When]{.underline} two
[[physicists]{.mark} published a paper documenting the
Higgs]{.underline} potential [conundrum]{.underline} in March, [their
[conclusion was]{.mark} that an [explanation lies beyond the Standard
Model, **not that the universe may collapse**]{.mark} **at any
time**]{.underline}.

<http://scottlocklin.wordpress.com/2010/08/24/nano-nonsense-25-years-of-charlatanry/>

I used to work next to the center for nanotechnology. [The first
indication I had that there was something wrong with the discipline of
"nanotechnology" is I noticed that the people who worked there were the
same people who used to do chemistry and material science]{.underline}.
It appeared to be a more fashionable label for these subjects. [Really
"material science" was a sort of fancy label for the chemistry of things
we use to build other things.]{.underline} OK, new name for "chemist."
Hopefully it ups the funding. Good for you guys.¶ La[ter on, I actually
read Drexler's Ph.D. thesis which invented the subject. I can sum it up
thusly:¶ Behold, the Schroedinger equation! ¶ With this mighty equation
we may go forth and invent an entirely new form of chemistry, with which
we may create new and superior forms of life which are mechanical in
their form, rather than squishy inefficient biological looking things.
We shall use the mighty powers of the computer to do these things! It
shall bring forth many great marvels!¶ That's it. That's what the whole
book is.]{.underline} Oh yes, there are a few collections of
intimidating tables and graphs purporting to indicate that such a thing
might be possible, and Drexler does sketch out some impressive looking
mechanical designs of what he supposes a nanobot might look like, but,
without more than a passing justification. [He seems to lack the
imagination, and of course, the **physics** to figure out what a real
nanosized doodad might look like. Much of his thesis seems to be hand
wavey arguments that his "looking rather a lot like a meter scale
object" designs would work on a nano or small microscale. I know for a
fact that they will not. You can wave your hands around all you want;
when you stick an atomic force microscope down on nanosized thingees,
you know what forces they produce. They don't act like macro-objects, at
all. Drexler would also occasionally notice that his perfect little
[robots would]{.mark} probably, you know, [**oxidize**, like most
reactive things]{.mark} do, and consign them to Ultra High Vacuum
chambers in a fit of embarrassment. Then sometimes he would forget about
the chemical properties of oxygen, and enthusiastically stick them
everywhere. **None** of the chemistry you'd need to figure out to **even
begin** to do this was done in his book. [**Little**]{.mark} real
[**thought** was given to thermodynamics or **where the energy was

from the Schroedinger equation) [[is]{.mark} basically
**[useless]{.mark}**. [Experimental results were **rarely**
mentioned]{.mark}, or explained away with the glorious equation of
Schroedinger, with which, all things seemed possible. [Self assembly was
deemed routine, **despite** the fact]{.mark} that [nobody knows how to
engineer such thing using macroscopic objects]{.mark}]{.underline}.¶
[There is modern and even ancient nano sized tech; lithographic
electronic chip features are down to this size now, and of course,
materials like asbestos were always nano sized. As far as [nano objects
for manipulating things on nanoscales;]{.mark} such things [**don't
exist**.]{.mark} Imagining [self replicating nanobots]{.mark} or nano
machines [is **ridiculous**]{.mark}. We don't even have micromachines.
[Mechanical objects on microscales **do not

seen is lithographically etched, or made on a watchmakers lathe. [Is it
cool? Yep]{.underline}; it's kind of cool. I have already worked for a
"millitech" company which was going to use tiny accelerometers to do
sensing stuff in your cell phone. [Will it change the universe? Nope.
Millitech miniaturization has been available for probably **300 years
now**]{.underline} (assuming the Greeks didn't have it); [lithography
just allows us to mass produce such things out of different
materials.]{.underline}¶ [This is an honest summary of Drexler's Ph.D.
thesis/book, and with that, a modest act of imagination, accompanied by
a tremendous act of chutzpah, and a considerable talent for self
promotion, he created what must be the most successful example of
"vaporware" of the late 20th and early 21st century]{.underline}. The
"molecular foundry" or "center for nanotechnology" or whatever nonsense
name they're calling the new chemistry building at LBL is but the tip of
the iceberg. [There are government organizations designed to keep up
America's leadership in this imaginary field. There are zillionaire
worryworts who are afraid this mighty product of Drexler's imagination
will some day turn us all into grey goo. There are news aggregators for
this nonexistent technology. There are even charlatans with foundations
promoting, get this, "responsible nanotech." All this, for a technology
which can't even remotely be thought of as existing in even
pre-pre-prototype form.]{.underline} It is as if someone read Isaac
Asimov's books on Robots of the future (written in the 1950s) and
thought to found government labs and foundations and centers to
responsibly deal with the implications of artificial intelligence from
"positronic brains." ¶ You'd think such an endeavor would have gone on
for, I don't know, a few years, before everyone realized Drexler was a
science fiction author who doesn't do plot or characterization. Nope;
[this insanity has gone on for 25 years now. Generations of academics
have spent their entire careers on this subject, yet not a **single
goal** or fundamental technology which would make this fantasy a
**remote** possibility has yet been developed. Must we work on it for
another 25 years before we realize that we can't even do the "take the
Schroedinger equation, figure out how simple molecules stick together"
prerequisites which are a fundamental requirement for so called
molecular engineering? How many more decades or centuries of research
before we can even create a macroscopic object which is capable of the
feat of "self replication," let alone a self replicator which works at
length scales which we have only a rudimentary understanding
of]{.underline}? How many more cases of nincompoops selling "nanotech
sunscreen" or "nanotech water filters" using the "nanotechnology" of
activated carbon; must I endure? How many more CIA reports on the
dangers of immanent [**[nanoterror]{.mark}**ism]{.underline} must my tax
dollar pay for, when such [[technologies are, **at best**, **centuries**
away]{.underline}]{.mark}? How many more vast coffers of government
largesse shall we shower on these clowns before we realize they're
selling snake oil?¶ [Drexler's answer to all this is, since nobody can
disprove the necessary things to develop nanotech, they will be
developed. Well, that depends what you mean by the words "can" and
"disprove." It also depends on what your time scale is. I'm willing to
bet, at some nebulous point in the future, long after Drexler and I are
dead, someone may eventually develop a technology sort of vaguely like
what he imagines. At least the parts that don't totally violate the laws
of thermodynamics and materials physics]{.underline} (probably, most of
the details do). As an argument, "[you can't disprove my crazy idea"
doesn't hold much water]{.underline} with me. [Doubtless there are many
denizens of the booby hatch who claim to be Jesus, and I can't really
disprove any of them, but I don't really see why I should be required
to. ¶ I have nothing against there being a few people who want to
achieve some of the scientific milestones needed to accomplish
"nanotech." I have a great deal against charlatans who claim that we
should actually invest significant resources into this crazy idea. If
you're an investor, and somebody's prospectus talks about "nano"
anything, assuming they're not selling you a semiconductor fab, you can
bet that they are selling you snake oil. **There is no nanotech**. Stop
talking about it. Start laughing at it. As Nobel prize winning chemist
Richard Smalley put it to Drexler: "No, you don't get it. **You are
still in a pretend world** where atoms go where you want because your
computer program directs them to go there."]{.underline}

[There\'s [this preprint]{.mark}]{.underline} by Krauss and Dent
[getting a lot of discussion that [suggests]{.mark}]{.underline}, in a
remark at the very end that was of course destined to get a writeup in
New Scientist, [that our astronomical [measurements of dark
energy]{.mark} may [destroy the universe]{.mark} for arcane quantum
reasons. I think **[it\'s totally wrong]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

The paper starts with an oddity that I learned about back in college,
that a system that decays exponentially will (if left completely
undisturbed) eventually pass to a realm in which it decays more slowly,
via power law. This is generally practically unobservable, but they
suggest it may have cosmological relevance if we live in an unstable
false vacuum: it interacts in an interesting way with the cosmic
inflation induced by dark energy, and this effect could be the only
thing keeping us around. But watch out: [[since observing]{.mark} the
system [\"resets the clock\" (the]{.mark}]{.underline} famous [quantum
[Zeno effect), we may]{.mark} have]{.underline} just [returned to the
exponential realm and thus [seal]{.mark}ed [our doom]{.mark} by
measuring the dark energy through supernova observations!]{.underline}
Eat of the fruit of the tree of knowledge and you shall die.

Max Tegmark points out the obvious objection, that [**this isn\'t really
magic**\--you don\'t really need a conscious observer with a telescope
to cause something like the quantum Zeno effect; all you need is some
coupling of other parts of the environment to the relevant operator.
**[Natural processes would have done this]{.mark} for us [long
ago]{.mark}**[,]{.mark} if it were so important]{.underline}.

Tegmark is absolutely right, but he doesn\'t go far enough. [Decay of
the false vacuum in such a scenario would]{.underline}, as Krauss
states, [destroy everything in the universe. It therefore follows that
there\'s a great big coupling here\--**continued survival of anything**
at all **constitutes a null-result \"measurement\"** that the dark
energy in our vicinity hasn\'t decayed yet]{.underline}. It seems to me
that [**[this invalidates the]{.mark} paper\'s [whole
argument]{.mark}**; the [undisturbed]{.mark} state [evolution]{.mark}
that leads to the power-law realm **[can\'t happen]{.mark}** in a

something really fundamental.

6\. Voracious black holes! A supermassive black hole roughly the weight
of 3 million suns almost certainly occupies the center of the Milky Way.
And smaller (actually, lighter) ones are probably wandering around in
space.

If such a rogue black hole happened to find its way into the solar
system, its gravitational influence would disrupt the orbits of all the
planets and their moons. Earth might slingshot out of the temperate
range it now occupies and into frigid reaches more familiar to Mars, or
it might be pushed closer to the sun to be singed, charred, or
vaporized. Worse, if a sufficiently large black hole were to pass
through the globe, it might be lights-out in more ways than one. The
planet would be sucked into a vortex of such intense gravity that
nothing would escape. The atoms that once made up Earth would be crushed
out of existence as it\'s currently understood. [[An encounter between
Earth and a black hole is **astronomically**]{.underline}]{.mark}, as it
were, **[[improbable]{.underline}]{.mark}**. However, collisions with
supermassive objects of any kind would not be survivable.

**No black holes** \-- The black holes would disappear instantly, or we
should be dead by now.

According to general relativity, [a black hole should form whenever some
mass is squeezed into a very small region of space.]{.underline} The
precise meaning of [\"very small\" is defined by a length scale called
the Schwarzschild radius]{.underline}. [This radius depends on the
mass]{.underline}, but also on the properties of whatever hidden extra
dimensions there might be. For certain kinds of extra dimensions, the
Schwarzschild radius of a given mass will be significantly larger than
otherwise. Consequently, in order to form a black hole, you wouldn\'t
need to compress matter nearly as much as in a space without extra
dimensions. Under those favourable conditions, collisions of protons
with other protons at the LHC should result in the formation of
miniature black holes.

More concretely: Protons consist of subcomponents called quarks. When
two quarks in collision do not just fly past each other, but collide
nearly head-on, then, at the energies achievable with the LHC, a
sufficiently high concentration of mass would result, and a mini-black
hole would form. In the following animation, the relevant portion of our
three-dimensional world is represented by a plane, embedded in a
higher-dimensional (in the image: three-dimensional) space. Ordinary
elementary particles are confined to the world-plane - they cannot ever
move out into the extra dimensions. When the two particles moving in
that plane have almost reached each other, a black hole forms, its
horizon represented by the black sphere:

**[[Black holes with a mass that is]{.mark} extremely [small are]{.mark}
extremely [unstable]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [The intensity of Hawking
radiation]{.underline}, a hypothetical quantum process by which black
holes emit elementary particles, [depends on the black hole\'s mass -
[the smaller the mass]{.mark} of a black hole, [the greater the]{.mark}
amount of [energy]{.mark} emitted in this way.]{.underline} By this
process, the **[mini[-black holes]{.mark} formed in particle
accelerators [would evaporate]{.mark} nearly [as soon as they are
created]{.mark}]{.underline}** - [typically, [such black holes]{.mark}
would only [exist for a]{.mark} few [tenth of a trillionth of a
trillionth]{.mark} (10-25, in exponential notation)
[second]{.mark}s]{.underline}. [Their decay would result in a sudden
blast of a few energetic particles]{.underline}. Possibly, some exotic
remnant object might survive as well (however, what such an object could
be, and whether or not there really are exotic remnants, is not at all
clear to present physics):

With respect to the numbers, types and energies of the resulting
particles a decaying black hole would look different from other particle
collisions. Some of its characteristics are directly related to the
existence of the extra dimensions: For instance, in the animation above,
you can see that some energy associated with gravity (shown as brown,
wiggly arrows) is carried off into the extra dimensions - from the point
of view of a physicist in our three-dimensional universe, this energy
would simply vanish!

When physicists study collisions in particle accelerators, they use
sensitive detectors to keep track of the different types of resulting
particles and their energies, which enables painstaking reconstructions
of each collision. The following image, based on a simulation, shows
what physicists might see in their detector when a mini-black hole
decays:

The image shows a sideways cut-away view of the particle detector CMS
currently under construction at the LHC accelerator. The colliding
particles move at right angles to the image, either directly towards the
observer or directly away. The lines represent traces of particles
produced by the black hole decay. The green line is the trace of an
electron, while the red lines are traces of particles called muons,
which are similar to electrons but more massive. The blue and cyan lines
denote particles consisting of quarks, and are thus distant kin to
protons and neutrons - so-called Kaons in blue, pions in cyan.

The detector contains a powerful magnet which produces a strong magnetic
field. This field deflects all moving particles which carry electric
charge - in the illustration, their traces are curved. The degree of
curvature, combined with other data, is used to infer each particle\'s
momentum and mass.

By studying collision products, physicists at LHC would be able to
identify and study the decay of mini-black holes. In this way, they
might be able to prove the existence of extra dimensions, and even gain
some insight into their properties.

[How often would black holes be produced? The answer depends on what
model of the extra dimensions one uses for the calculation. According to
some models, black holes should be produced at the LHC at a rate of one
per second!]{.underline}

[If particle collisions at high-energy may indeed create black holes, we
should also expect creation of other gravitational objects which are
predicted by string theory, such as higher-dimensional spatially
extended solutions of the gravitational equations called branes -
cousins of the three-dimensional extended subdomain that is our
world]{.underline}.

Artificial mini-black holes - should we worry?

Do [we need to worry? Might these mini black holes start growing and,
eventually, devour the whole earth? **We should not worry about
this**]{.underline}. [Even if you do not trust the calculations
predicting a quick demise for such minuscule black holes, there is solid
data to go by.]{.underline}

[If black holes really form in high-energy particle collisions, they are
**also continuously created in the earth\'s atmosphere** by the
collision of Ultra High-Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECRs)]{.underline} with
nuclei of oxygen, carbon, nitrogen and other elements present in the
atmosphere.

[UHECRs are particles of unknown origin and identity]{.underline}
(protons? light atomic nuclei?) [reaching the earth from outer space. In
such collisions with atmospheric nuclei, a shower of new particles is
produced]{.underline} (consisting mostly of electrons, their slightly
more massive cousins called muons, and photons). These particles can be
detected by specialized observatories on earth or in space, as sketched
in the following illustration:

[[The collision energies]{.mark} for UHECRs can be
enormous]{.underline} - some observations show energies of [hundreds of
TeV]{.underline} (hundreds of trillions of electron volts), **[which [is
much larger than]{.mark} the collision energies in particle collider
[experiments]{.mark}]{.underline}**. And while the events with very high
energy are exceedingly rare, [[this]{.mark} type of collision [has been
going on for literally billions of years]{.mark}, so an inordinate
number of mini black holes would have formed]{.underline}. [Since the
earth has not (yet!) disappeared into one of these black holes, the much
less massive man-made mini black holes should be quite
safe.]{.underline}

[The rarity of ultra-high energy collisions is also one of the reasons
that physicists have not been able to confirm or disprove the formation
of mini-black holes in this way]{.underline}. Still, this could change
over the next few years, as the Pierre Auger Cosmic Ray Observatory in
Argentina, which has just started taking data, becomes fully
operational.

So will we actually find these tiny black holes? Hard to tell - at the
moment, [we have no direct evidence that the models predicting the
existence of extra dimensions are on the right track]{.underline}, and
if they are, that [among all the many possible shapes and sizes for the
extra dimensions, those realized in our universe allow the production of
miniature black holes at a detectable rate]{.underline}. Our search is
akin to playing the lottery - we will need to get very, very lucky to
find what we seek, but [if we did, the payoff would be enormous: We
would have the first direct evidence that space has extra
dimensions!]{.underline}

True, there is some variation in future-anticipating behavior among
individual humans. [[A **small percentage**]{.mark} of the population

The [sixth and ninth of August 2015 mark the [seventieth anniversaries
of]{.mark} the nuclear bombings of the Japanese cities of [Hiroshima and
Nagasaki]{.mark}]{.underline}. The total death toll exacted by these
first ever, and as yet only, use of nuclear weapons may never really be
known. Estimates range from 70,000 to double that number depending on
the counting criteria used. [Nuclear weapons surely deserve the
descriptor "weapons of mass destruction,"]{.underline} but it is also
true that the incendiary bombs dropped on Tokyo during two days in March
1945, generating one of the greatest fire storms the world has ever
seen, had a kill rate similar to that of the atomic bombs. In our times,
a dirty bomb might have as horrifying an effect as a tactical nuclear
weapon. The [nuclear [bombs]{.mark} were [dropped]{.mark} over three
[generations ago but]{.mark} their **[significance continues]{.mark} to
resonate in Japan and around the world.**]{.underline} Washington used
its nuclear power against Japan to save the American lives that would
have had to be sacrificed in an effort to pacify a Japan that in early
August 1945 still did not consider itself defeated, and whose military
tradition was continuing to push its men in uniform to fight to the
death. [Within a week of the nuclear bombing of Nagasaki, the Japanese
Emperor announced that his country was ready to sue for
peace.]{.underline} Washington's resort to the nuclear option has been a
catalyst for the anti-Americanism that has been a constant feature of
the post-war period. The underlying story has been that the American
lives saved were worth more that the Japanese ones destroyed. An
understandable judgment, this fails to take in to account just how many
Japanese lives were spared when Tokyo elected to capitulate almost
immediately after the second attack and how many more Japanese would
have been killed if their country's soldiers had continued to fight to
the death in an effort to repel an Allied invasion. It is worth noting
that on the day before the nuclear attack on Nagasaki, the Soviet Union
declared war on Japan. This action suggested that the pattern of
communist expansionism that had been put in evidence on the western
front as Hitler's armies collapsed and Stalin's advanced stood to be
repeated in Asia. Against this background, Washington's decision to go
nuclear was also likely designed to fire a warning shot across Moscow's
bow. With that as background, [[let's look at how the world has
evolved]{.mark} on the nuclear front [since]{.mark} 1945]{.underline}.
Here, several elements stand out. Crucially, **[[a non-proliferation
regime]{.mark} has been in place since 1970 that has discouraged states
from going the nuclear route]{.underline}**. This has been undergirded
by a commitment by the five nuclear powers that sponsored the accord to
work for a steady decrease in their nuclear arsenals. Thus, the number
of nuclear warheads has decreased from a high of roughly 68,000 in 1985
to some 4,000 now, with an additional 6,000 or so having been
decommissioned but not destroyed. **[[At the same time, there has been
a]{.mark} modest but still [disconcerting increase in the number of
nuclear weapon states]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In addition to the first
generation nuclear powers -- the US, the USSR, the PRC, the UK and
France -- [[India]{.mark} and [Pakistan]{.mark} are nuclear empowered as
are [Israel]{.mark} and [North Korea]{.mark}. All four powers are
outside the non-proliferation regime]{.underline}. Israel does not admit
to its nuclear status; North Korea wears it as a badge. Just how many
nuclear weapons the second-tier nuclear states have is unclear, but
their nuclear arsenals are probably sufficient to blow up a large part
of the world. Nonetheless, the **[nukes have remained holstered since
those fateful days in August seventy years ago. Why?]{.underline}** One
reason is that [the [military advantages of using nuclear weapons have
been **outweighed by the significant political costs associated with
their deployment**]{.mark}]{.underline}, as the US case has
demonstrated.

CATASTROPHE AND THE END OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS

In the year 2025, the world very nearly came to an end. Smarting after
several years of economic downturn and angry at American efforts to
encircle it with NATO bases, Russia responded to a \"plea\" for help
from co-ethnics in the Baltic states. Thousands of Russian troops,
disguised as contract \"volunteers\" dashed across international borders
allegedly to protect Russian speakers from governmental assaults. The
Baltic countries invoked Article 5 of the NATO Treaty while American
forces, deployed there precisely to deter this kind of aggression,
clashed with Russian troops. Hundreds of Americans were killed.
Washington warned Moscow to halt its invasion to no avail. The United
States then prepared for a major airlift of its forces to the
beleaguered countries, with Moscow threatening America with
\"unrestrained force\" if it followed through. Washington ignored the
threat and Moscow, seeking to \"de-escalate by escalating,\" destroyed
the American base of Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean with a
nuclear-armed cruise missile. The United States responded with limited
nuclear strikes against Russian bases in Siberia. Thus far, the
collateral damage had been kept to a minimum, but this bit of
encouragement did not last. Fearing a massive American pre-emptive
strike aimed at disarming its nuclear arsenal, Russia struck first
against the range of US nuclear forces both in the United States and at
sea. America responded with its surviving weapons, destroying much (but
not all) of the remaining Russian nuclear arms. And then, both sides
took a breather, but it was too late. Although cities had been largely
spared, millions had died on each side. Making matters worse,
predictions of nuclear winter came to pass - producing massive changes
in the weather and killing millions more, especially in developing
states.

The world finally had enough. A dawning realization emerged that

leaders of countries simply could not be trusted with weapons that could
destroy humankind.3 Protests swept the globe calling for total
disarmament. Mass demonstrations engulfed the United States and Russia
demanding the replacement of their existing governments with ones
committed to ending nuclear weapons. Voices calling for more moderate
disarmament that would preserve a modest nuclear deterrent were angrily
(and sometimes violently) quashed. The possession of nuclear weapons
became morally repugnant and unacceptable. No longer were the
intricacies of nuclear doctrine or force levels subject to debate. The
only question remaining was how one could get rid of these loathsome
weapons as quickly as possible.

Under the auspices of the United Nations, a joint committee composed of
the Security Council members, other countries known to possess nuclear
arms, and several non-nuclear powers was established. Drawing on the
structure and precedent of the Chemical Weapons Convention, this UN body
drew up the Treaty that called for the complete disarmament of nuclear
arms by 2030. The development, possession, and use of nuclear weapons
was prohibited.

An airtight inspection regime, enhancing the procedures already in
existence through the Non-Proliferation Treaty, was established to first
account for all nuclear arms and fissile material and then monitor the
destruction of the nuclear weaponry. All countries were subject to the
Treaty, whether they maintained nuclear facilities or not. Violations
would produce a range of punishment from global economic sanctions to
massive conventional attack.\' 6

By 2030, all the nations of the world had agreed to the Treaty. No
violations occurred. Armed conflicts persisted, but they proved to be of
modest scale, erupting only within countries but not between them.
Insofar as the fear of nuclear weapons helped keep the peace during the
Cold War and post-Cold War eras, the horror of nuclear use now made war
all but unthinkable. A feeling of relief swept the globe as the specter
of nuclear holocaust vanished, tempered only by the painful regret that
it took the death of millions to realize a goal that for so many had
been self-evident since 1945.

**\-\--THEIR EVIDENCE ENDS\-\--**

CONCLUSION

The nuclear world of 2030 might look a lot like the nuclear world of
2018 where deterrence reigns supreme; or it might be a world of warring
states where the use of nuclear weapons becomes frighteningly
commonplace; or it might be a traumatized world that has rid itself of
nuclear weapons. Or it might be none of these. [Choosing

many would select a world where nuclear war becomes normalized, but the
increasing development of low-yield, highly accurate weapons along with
doctrines guiding their use in limited conflicts suggests that we need
to prepare for just this eventuality arising. Maybe the best we can hope
for is the world we are most familiar with; a world where nuclear
weapons help to keep the peace as they have done for the past seventy
years. It is not a terrible outcome if deterrence can indeed be
maintained. If not, [the nuclear worlds of 2030 will look much more like
the other two possibilities, or perhaps, if worst comes to worst, **no
world at all**]{.underline}.

It has often been observed that the two most important questions of the
nuclear era are both essentially unanswerable: how likely is deterrence
failure (or nuclear use)?  And what happens after nuclear weapons are
used?  My view on the current situation is that the nuclear problem is
growing, taking dangerous new forms, and that there is a growing
likelihood that nuclear weapons use will occur.  [[In the]{.underline}
**[past]{.underline}**]{.mark} [[I was optimistic]{.mark} [that]{.mark}
[nuclear use]{.mark} [would]{.mark} [be a]{.mark} catalytic event for a
substantial **[world order reform]{.mark}**, or even revolution, a
view]{.underline} [**widely held by many**[.  But I am now less
confident]{.mark} that 'the deluge will lead to the covenant.'  Rather,
[nuclear use]{.mark} now [might trigger]{.mark} an extended period
of]{.underline} [**further arms racing and [further nuclear]{.mark}
[use]{.mark}**.  This is, of course, a]{.underline} [**double tragedy in
the making**. With all the pressing problems the world faces, most
notably climate change, it is **simply obscene that we are sliding in
the wrong direction on the nuclear question.**]{.underline}

The discussion in this section so far assumes that [the third use of
nuclear weapons]{.underline} would negatively affect the
nonproliferation regime. It is also possible, and somewhat paradoxical,
that nuclear use [would result in a]{.underline} **[stronger
regime]{.underline}**. The international community often reacts to
disasters by instituting sweeping reforms. Most of the major
improvements to the nonproliferation regime since 1970 resulted from
crises of confidence in existing measures. India's nuclear test in 1974
led to the creation of the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), a cartel
designed to regulate trade in nuclear technology and materials. Iraq's
violations of the NPT prior to the 1991 Persian Gulf War caused the
international community to give the International Atomic Energy Agency
(IAEA), the main enforcer of the NPT, more teeth through the 1997
Additional Protocol. In addition, the international community sought to
strengthen global export controls by passing United Nations Security
Council Resolution 1540 after the public exposure of the A. Q. Khan
network, 199 a Pakistani-based operation that supplied nuclear
weapon-related technology to Iran, Libya, and North Korea. As these
examples illustrate, sweeping reforms are sometimes possible in a time
of crisis. [The third use of nuclear weapons would no doubt be horrific.
It might]{.underline}, therefore, [create a]{.underline} [**broad
international consensus** to]{.underline} **[strengthen nonproliferation
norms]{.underline}** [in an attempt to **lower the odds**]{.underline}
[that the bomb would be used a fourth time. This **does not imply that
the third use of nuclear weapons would be**]{.underline} a
**[good]{.underline}** thing. [The]{.underline} **[negative
consequences]{.underline}** [would]{.underline} **[outweigh any marginal
improvement in the nonproliferation regime resulting from nuclear
use.]{.underline}**
