### 1NC UQ\-\--GOP Win

#### Most polls are wrong, GOP win is possible

**Gingrich 7-21** (Newt Gingrich, Former Speaker of the U.S. House of
Representatives. Ph.D in European History @ Tulane University. "Former

[There is [consensus that]{.mark} U.S. House [Republicans]{.mark} [will
win a majority]{.mark} this fall, and that Kevin McCarthy will be the
next speaker of the House.]{.underline} There is a lot more confusion
about the U.S. Senate races. [[Republicans are handwringing]{.mark},
[and Democrats are hopeful]{.mark} as they think through the
state-by-state races for U.S. Senate.]{.underline} But [[there\'s a
flaw]{.mark} [in]{.mark} the popular Senate [race analysis.]{.mark}
[Most people]{.mark} are [thinking]{.mark} about Senate [races as small,
individual contests]{.mark}]{.underline}. When you think of each race as
small and individual, there is hope the Democrats could keep the current
50-50 split---or lose only a few seats. [This kind of small race
[analysis emphasizes candidate quality,]{.mark} money raised, and
current polling (which is inconclusive, at best)[.]{.mark} [But]{.mark}
if the 2022 Senate [elections are analyzed and run as a big,]{.mark}
[nationalized races]{.mark}, [the Democrats will likely lose the Senate
by a wide margin.]{.mark}]{.underline} When you have [[9.1%
inflation]{.mark} (compared to 1.4% inflation when Donald Trump left
office), Democratic candidates at any level should feel like they are in
trouble.]{.underline} The highest price of gasoline in history---more
than double the price just two years ago---does not help them. And those
aren\'t the only problems Americans are seeing and feeling every day.
Add skyrocketing murder, rape, and robbery rates; millions of people
entering the country illegally receiving taxpayer-funded benefits, and
continuing labor and supply chain disruptions caused by destructive
government programs. [Further, consider the unpopular cultural policies
being implemented by federal bureaucrats with aggressive agendas. Given
all these big problems, [it is difficult to see how we can expect small
race outcomes]{.mark} in U.S. Senate races---[unless Republicans are
extraordinarily committed to self-destructive behavior]{.mark} and
out-of-touch Washington-focused consultants.]{.underline} In Georgia,
for example, Herschel Walker may have a hard time winning a small race
campaign against an extraordinarily well-funded incumbent and
professional preacher, such as Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-GA[). These were
not simply Republican or conservative tsunamis; they were American
tsunamis. The American people were tired of policies that don\'t work
being forced upon them by bureaucrats and politicians who don\'t live in
the real world.]{.underline} We are now on the edge of another American
tsunami. As I wrote in my new book, Defeating Big Government Socialism:
Saving America\'s Future, there is an emerging tidal wave of Democrats,
Republicans, and independents who want us to come together and solve
problems with common sense rather than Washington sense. They are
totally sick of Washington sense. [Some [87% of Americans want to
restore]{.mark} the [America]{.mark} that works. By a 91% to 6% margin,
the American people agree with Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. that the
content of our character matters far more than the color of our skin.
[This American tsunami]{.mark} [is going to defeat an amazing number of
sitting Democratic sena]{.mark}tors, as well as hopeful Democratic
candidates.]{.underline}

#### GOP will most likely win Congress

**Schoen 7-24** (Douglas E. Schoen is a political consultant who served
as an adviser to former President Clinton and to the 2020 presidential
campaign of Michael Bloomberg. He is the author of "The End of
Democracy? Russia and China on the Rise and America in Retreat."

agenda",
https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/3571562-republicans-missing-2022-ingredient-a-positive-and-constructive-agenda/)LR

**[[Republicans]{.mark} [have every reason to be optimistic]{.mark} that
[their party will win]{.mark} control of the House --- and likely [the
Senate]{.mark} --- [in]{.mark} the November [midterm
elections]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [The [Democratic Party is defending
razor-thin majorities]{.mark} in Congress at a time when
[Americans]{.mark} [broadly disapprove]{.mark} [of]{.mark} President
[Biden]{.mark} and are [deeply pessimistic about the way things are
going]{.mark} in the country, especially with the economy.]{.underline}
Indeed, nearly three-quarters of Americans (72 percent) say that the
country is on the wrong track, and a majority (51 percent) describe the
economy as being in "poor shape." There is also a widespread belief that
inflation is a very serious problem (64 percent) and that Biden bears at
least some responsibility for it (73 percent). Given how unfavorable the
current national political environment is for Democrats --- [on top of
the fact that [the president's party almost always loses House seats in
midterm elections]{.mark} --- criticizing the Biden administration for
[inflation]{.mark} and the [rising cost of living]{.mark} could very
well be a sufficient strategy for the G.O.P. to win control of Congress
this year.]{.underline} That being said, in order for a true red-wave
election to take place in 2022 --- and to sustain itself through 2024
--- Republicans need to do more at the national, state and local levels
than just attack Democrats and oppose their agenda. [Rather, the GOP
must develop a positive and constructive agenda that offers centrist
solutions to the key issues facing the country in order to show the
American people that the party's priorities are in line with their
own.]{.underline} It is also critical that the new Republican agenda is
forward-looking, and not focused on relitigating Donald Trump's past
grievances about the 2020 election. Continuing to dwell on the 2020
election is counterproductive to the G.O.P.'s short- and long-term
political goals, as it alienates swing voters and Independents --- who
largely accept Joe Biden's victory as legitimate, believe Jan. 6 was an
attempted insurrection and are concerned about addressing the challenges
of today, not fighting about alleged voter fraud in the last election.
In order to reach these voters in the middle, [Republicans should
promote an economic plan that provides tax incentives for job creation,
prioritizes deficit reduction, eases inflation and limits government
spending to fiscally prudent programs that have broad public support,
such as Medicare and Medicaid. Loosening overly burdensome regulations
on America's energy sector would also be immensely beneficial in terms
of helping the U.S. achieve energy independence]{.underline} --- which
the public increasingly recognizes as an important goal, given the
current crisis with gas prices. Furthermore, instead of criticizing
Democrats for surging crime and the migrant crisis at the Southern
border, Republicans should propose actual solutions such as increasing
funding to bolster and better train law enforcement officers --- both
police officers in localities, and patrol agents at the southern border.
[To that end, the GOP can lead the way by proposing a long-overdue
immigration compromise that strengthens our physical border security and
also provides a pathway to citizenship for the millions of undocumented
immigrants brought here illegally as children.]{.underline} National
Republicans should also take a page from Virginia Governor Glenn
Youngkin's 2021 playbook by promoting individual liberties generally,
and specifically empowering parents through enhanced school choice
opportunities and promoting greater parental involvement in curricula.
This strategy helped Youngkin connect with moderate suburban voters,
which is the precise coalition that the G.O.P. should be targeting in
2022. Perhaps most importantly, on hot-button social issues --- namely,
abortion and guns --- the G.O.P. needs to establish a more moderate
party line in order to distance itself from the party's extreme fringes.
Put another way, the Republican Party's positions on these issues must
reflect the reality that Americans broadly support abortion as a legal
right with limitations, and widely favor common-sense restrictions on
gun ownership that still allow law-abiding citizens to own guns. Towing
the centrist line on abortion and guns can be enormously beneficial to
the Republican Party. By assuming a more open stance on abortion
legality, Republicans can better sell their party as one that protects
individual liberties; similarly, by moving to the middle on guns, the
GOP can position and promote themselves as the law and order party.
Ultimately, Republicans merely opposing Democrats at every turn is not
enough to produce a red-wave election in 2022 and will certainly not be
enough to carry a pro-Republican trend through to 2024. In order for the
G.O.P. to secure a red wave in 2022 and improve their chances of
retaking the White House in 2024, the party needs to coalesce around a
moderate agenda that offers real solutions, avoids relitigating past
grievances, and rejects the party's extreme fringes.

ANALYSIS --- If you are from [New York, Nebraska, Oregon, Vermont or
Mississippi]{.underline}, you have the same right to vote that everyone
else in the country does. But that doesn't mean that you will have the
same political clout. In fact, you [are likely to be irrelevant in this
fall's elections. The midterm dynamic tends to be far stronger in the
House than in Senate contests, where individual candidates matter more.
So, the focus for 2022 is very much still on the midterm Senate races.
Voters in seven states will decide who controls the U.S. Senate in
2023-24: **[Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina,
Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.]{.mark}** [If Republicans]{.mark} [net even
one]{.mark} seat in the fall midterms, [they]{.mark} [can block]{.mark}
President Joe [Biden]{.mark}'s judicial, diplomatic and executive branch
[appointees for the rest of his term.]{.mark}]{.underline} While some of
those seven states have large populations --- Pennsylvania is the fifth
most populous, Georgia the eighth, North Carolina the ninth, Arizona the
14th, Wisconsin the 20th, Nevada the 32nd and New Hampshire the 41st,
according to the 2020 census [--- only a handful of voters in each state
will decide who wins their 2022 Senate races.]{.underline} That is
because most voters are reliably Republican or reliably Democratic. They
may well tell you that they are independents who cast their votes
depending on their evaluation of the candidates, but that is usually
poppycock. Most are closet partisans who vote consistently for one party
or the other but like the idea of being "independent." Since each of the
seven states is almost evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans,
those partisans generally don't decide who wins. It is true swing voters
--- "soft" Democrats, and "soft" Republicans in those states who have
the power to pick winners in any statewide contest. Traditionally,
turnout in midterm elections is significantly below that in presidential
years, so part of the parties' electoral calculations includes their
ability to turn out out voters who otherwise would not show up at the
polls in a typical midterm. In most of these states, the handful of
crucial voters come from one of two demographic categories. Either they
are minority voters who don't always turn out --- such as in
Philadelphia, DeKalb County (Atlanta) or Nevada, for example --- or they
are suburban white swing voters, who are fiscally conservative but
culturally progressive and live and work in places like the Philadelphia
suburbs, the Atlanta suburbs, and Maricopa County (Phoenix). [Candidates
matter in the handful of competitive House races in 2022, but they will
matter much more in the fight for the Senate. Senate campaigns spend
dramatically more money and get far more media attention than do House
contests, and voters get to know Senate hopefuls better than they do
House candidates. Moreover, few House districts are competitive. Swing
voters and base turnout will be crucial in a state like
Georgia]{.underline}, where Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden
and Senate hopeful Raphael Warnock squeezed out narrow victories in
2020. Warnock beat appointed Sen. Kelly Loeffler 51 percent to 49
percent, a margin of about 95,000 votes out of 4.5 million cast.
[[Warnock is likely to win or lose narrowly]{.mark} in November,
depending on whether minority voters turn out and whether suburban women
are more upset about inflation or the Republican Party's continued veer
to the right]{.underline} --- as well as the Supreme Court's decisions.
[The s[ame is true in Pennsylvania,]{.mark} where blue-collar Democrat
John Fetterman and TV celebrity and Trump-backed Republican Mehmet Oz
are expected to be locked in a close contest.]{.underline} Can Fetterman
turn out minority voters and people in the Philadelphia suburbs the way
Biden did (carrying the state by 80,000 votes in 2020), or will
Fetterman underperform among those groups in November the way Hillary
Clinton did (losing the state by 45,000 voters in the 2016 presidential
race), increasing the likelihood of an Oz victory? A relative handful of
voters will decide[. [In Arizona]{.underline}]{.mark}[, Democrat Mark
Kelly defeated appointed GOP Sen. Martha McSally 51.2 percent to 48.8
percent --- a margin of about 80,000 votes out of 3.3 million votes cast
for the two nominees. [Can Kelly hold the suburbs]{.mark} in 2022
[without Trump on the ballo]{.mark}t [and with inflation]{.mark} among
voters' top concern?]{.underline} The one thing that is almost
inevitable is that the winners will claim a mandate and act as if they
won decisively. In fact, it is likely that relatively small percentages
of swing voters --- as well as turnout rates --- will separate the
winners from the losers.

Minutes into her pitch at the Cochise County Republican headquarters in
the suburbs of southern Arizona, [Ms. [Lake]{.mark} [zeroed in]{.mark}
on the [presidential election]{.mark} 18 months ago, [calling it
"crooked" and "corrupt."]{.mark} She claimed nearly a dozen times in a
single hour that the 2020 election was stolen from Donald J. Trump, a
falsehood that [the audience]{.mark}]{.underline} --- some of whom wore
red hats reading "Trump Won" --- [[was eager to hear]{.mark}. Ms. Lake,
a former local Fox anchor who won Mr. Trump's endorsement as she
campaigns to become Arizona's next governor, calls the 2020 election a
key motivation in her decision to enter the race.]{.underline} "We need
some people with a backbone to stand up for this country --- we had our
election stolen," Ms. Lake said in an interview after the Cochise County
event in March, adding, "I don't know if it's a winning issue, but it's
a winning issue when it comes to saving this country." Republicans in
many states have grown increasingly tired of the Stop the Steal movement
and the push by Mr. Trump to reward election deniers and punish those
who accept President Biden's victory[. At a time when Mr. Biden's
approval ratings are sinking, leaders in the party are urging candidates
to focus instead on the economy, inflation and other kitchen-table
issues. But 12 weeks before its Republican primary in August, **[Arizona
shows]{.mark}** just **[how firm of a grasp]{.mark}** Mr. Trump and his
**[election conspiracy theories still have at every level of the
party]{.mark}, [from]{.mark} local [activists]{.mark} [to]{.mark} top
statewide [candidates]{.mark}.**]{.underline} And this week's victory
for J.D. Vance, the "Hillbilly Elegy" author who received the former
president's endorsement in the Republican primary for an Ohio Senate
seat, shows that loyalty to Trumpism goes a long way in battleground
states. Two forces have helped ensure election denialism remains a core
issue in Arizona: the Republican-sponsored and widely derided review of
the presidential vote in the state's largest county, and Mr. Trump's
continued attacks on the Republican governor, Doug Ducey, for rebuffing
his efforts to block election certification. More than three dozen
Republicans running for office in Arizona --- including six candidates
for statewide posts --- have made denying the 2020 results a centerpiece
of their campaigns, according to two groups tracking candidates, States
United Action and Pro-Democracy Republicans[. States United Action is
nonpartisan; Maricopa County's top elections official, a Republican,
began Pro-Democracy Republicans last year. "There's [nothing but
elitists in charge]{.mark}," said Suzanne Jenkins, a 75-year-old
[retiree]{.mark} who described herself as a Tea Party Republican and who
[drove about an hour]{.mark} to Sierra Vista [to hear Ms. Lake
speak]{.mark}.]{.underline} But winning the crowded Republican primary
is far from certain. Ms. Lake faces especially fierce opposition from
Karrin Taylor Robson, a Phoenix-based business owner who has contributed
millions to her own campaign. [Already, the race to replace Mr. Ducey,
who cannot run again because of term limits, has become among the most
expensive governor's races in state history, with \$13.6 million in
spending so far.]{.underline}

[LAS VEGAS, July 20 (Reuters) - Susie [Lee]{.mark}, one of the U.S.
[Congress\'s most endangered]{.mark} [Democrat]{.mark}s, has spent this
year fighting [a tough re-election campaign]{.mark} in the face of
soaring inflation and weighed down by President Joe Biden\'s dismal
approval numbers.]{.underline} Then on June 24, the U.S. Supreme Court
threw a potential lifeline to the Nevada congresswoman as she seeks a
third term in this November\'s midterm elections: the justices ended
federal abortion rights by overturning the landmark 1973 Roe-v-Wade
decision. [Within 24 hours, armed with an issue she hopes will galvanize
voters and reverse a disastrous-looking election year for Democrats, Lee
launched the first ad of her campaign - a \$500,000 TV and digital
attack on her pro-life Republican opponent on the issue of abortion
rights.]{.underline} \"We have a stark choice in the race for
Congress,\" the ad declares. Lee, like dozens of fellow endangered
Democratic incumbents across the United States, is refocusing much of
her campaign on abortion rights, hoping the Supreme Court\'s decision
can help win back suburban voters who have soured on her party because
of high food and gas prices and an unpopular president. Frustrated with
what they see as weak messaging by national party leaders on Biden\'s
policy achievements, [some Democratic foot soldiers say the overturning
of Roe-v-Wade has thrown them a political lifeline, a]{.underline} foot
in the door of voters otherwise disinclined to listen to them because of
high inflation. [Party [strategists]{.mark} [and analysts warn]{.mark},
however, that the **issue of [abortion]{.mark} [rights will]{.mark}**
likely [**not be enough to save Democrats from losing control**
of]{.mark} the U.S. House of Representatives, and possibly **[the Senate
too]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Brian Stryker, a Democratic pollster, said
that while there has been a shift of about three percentage points in
national opinion surveys toward Democrats since the court\'s ruling,
\"[[inflation is]{.mark} still far and away [voters\' top
concern]{.mark}.\" Some of the eight on-the-ground Democrat workers and
abortion activists who talked to Reuters conceded that surging inflation
is still a big problem for Democrats, and that the abortion issue may
not be enough keep Congress in Democrats\' hands. \"[Everyone]{.mark}

[In the Deluxe version of our midterm election forecast,
[Republicans]{.mark} [have]{.mark} a 85 percent chance to win the House

unchanged from when we launched the model three weeks ago.]{.underline}
Meanwhile, in the Classic version of the model, which sticks to purely
quantitative factors and leaves out the expert race ratings published by
the Cook Political Report and other such groups, [[Republicans]{.mark}
[are actually underdogs]{.mark} to win control of the Senate, with a 39
percent chance.]{.underline} [[Part of the reason]{.mark}
[Republicans]{.mark} [are not]{.mark} better [positioned in]{.mark} the
Senate is they [don't have a lot of easy pick-up opportunities]{.mark},
[but]{.mark} **one race where [Republicans could gain traction]{.mark}
is [the New Hampshire Senate]{.mark} [race]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
Democratic incumbent Sen. Maggie Hassan has led in all but one poll this
year against a series of potential Republican opponents, but the GOP
shouldn't write the race off[. **[Hassan's lead is small]{.mark}** in
most of these polls, [and **it's still early**]{.mark}, with the primary
not scheduled until Sept. 13]{.underline}.1 New Hampshire is also an
unusual state in that it has some factors that should make it relatively
fertile ground to defeat an incumbent, and others that should make it a
challenging one. So let's take a look under the hood. [The factor that
could help Republicans most is that [New Hampshire]{.mark} ---
**[famous]{.mark} [for]{.mark} polling [leads]{.mark} [that]{.mark} seem
to [evaporate overnight]{.mark}**]{.underline}**,** like Barack Obama's
against Hillary Clinton's in the Democratic primary there in 2008 ---

it's a swing state, although it frequently is in general elections. I
also mean that it has a lot of swing voters: moderate**, [[independent
voters who split their tickets]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Consider that, in
2020, Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen won reelection there by 16
percentage points, while Republican Gov. Chris Sununu was reelected by
32 points on the same ballot.2

the]{.underline} Russian [invasion of Ukraine]{.underline} again
[[faced]{.mark} a [vote]{.mark} in the House]{.underline}, the
[[support]{.mark} was **far [more polarized]{.mark}**]{.underline}, with
63 Republicans --- [**[30 percent]{.mark}** of the party]{.underline}'s
conference --- [[voting]{.mark} [against]{.mark} it]{.underline}. The
[vote [underscores]{.mark} the [Republican Party's]{.mark} **remarkable
[drift away]{.mark}** [from NATO]{.mark}]{.underline} in recent years,
as positions once considered part of a libertarian fringe have become
doctrine for a growing portion of the party. The [isolationist posture
of]{.underline} some [Republicans]{.underline} is [[in line]{.mark}
[with]{.mark}]{.underline} the "**[[America
First]{.underline}]{.mark}**" [[ethos]{.mark} of Trump]{.underline}, the
GOP's de facto leader, [who has **long railed against
NATO**]{.underline}. Last week, speaking at a Heritage Foundation event
in Florida, Trump implied that as president he had threatened not to
defend NATO allies from Russian attacks as a negotiating tactic to
pressure them to contribute more money toward the organization's shared
defense. The [vote]{.underline} also [comes against]{.underline} the
[backdrop of Russia's invasion]{.underline} of Ukraine, which has
catapulted NATO to its most prominent role in decades. And it comes as
some hawkish [[Republicans]{.mark} [seek to]{.mark} cast [themselves
as]{.mark} **[stronger opponents]{.mark}** of **Russia** than
Democrats]{.underline}. Metin Hakverdi, a German lawmaker who chairs the
North America working group within the ruling Social Democratic Party,
said the question that preoccupies him is, "Was Donald Trump the
exception, or will Joe Biden be the exception?" Some two dozen House GOP
lawmakers who voted for the 2019 NATO Support Act voted against the
similar resolution this month, which reaffirmed support for the alliance
and its principles. But in interviews, several of those House
Republicans said they still support the organization and simply objected
to what they viewed as problematic provisions that Democrats had added
to the bill for perceived political purposes. Several who switched their
votes since 2019 objected to measures they said did not specifically
address strengthening NATO to help Ukraine. Rep. Barry Loudermilk
(R-Ga.) found it particularly problematic that the resolution instructed
NATO to be involved when a country has "internal threats from proponents
on illiberalism," which he says could be interpreted as conservatism. "I
am a huge supporter of NATO --- I served in the Air Force during the
Cold War, worked with NATO during that time period," he said. "These
issues should be left to those individual nations." Loudermilk argued
that Democrats had inserted "poison pills" into the symbolic resolution,
which could be used against Republicans in the 2022 midterms. "It was
the Democrats trying to politicize something and add things in there
that we have no business working on," he said, explaining his vote
against the bill. Similarly, from Rep. Robert B. Aderholt (R-Ala.): "I
am wholeheartedly, unequivocally, without reservation, supportive on
NATO." But Aderholt said he worried that the resolution "had some
language in that I thought went on the political side. And I don't want
to see NATO go political. I want to see NATO stand up for, you know,
what's going on in Ukraine --- stand up for Ukraine against Russia." The
two bills are not exactly the same. The legislation in 2019 reaffirmed
that federal money should not be used to remove the United States from
NATO --- which Trump was threatening at the time --- while the bill from
this month called on the government to "uphold the founding democratic
principles of NATO," as well for NATO "to continue to provide unwavering
support to the people of Ukraine as they fight for their sovereignty,
territorial integrity, and a democratic future." Another sign of the
party's isolationist wing emerged Thursday, as the House passed an
update to a World War II-era military bill creating a lend-lease program
intended to make it easier for the United States to supply Ukraine with
military aid. Only 10 lawmakers --- all Republicans --- voted against
the measure. In an exchange earlier in the week between Secretary of
State Antony Blinken, who was testifying before Congress, and Sen. Rand
Paul (R-Ky.), Paul pushed back on Blinken's assertion that over the
years Russia has shown a willingness to attack countries like Georgia
that are not part of NATO, while giving wider berth to countries that
are members of the alliance. "You could also argue the countries they've
attacked were part of Russia, or were part of the Soviet Union," said
Paul, who was one of just two senators who voted against a 2018 bill
reaffirming support for a NATO, in what was at the time a pointed rebuke
of Trump. "Yes, and I firmly disagree with that proposition," Blinken
responded. For some foreign policy experts and international allies,
[the mere fact that]{.underline} nearly [one-third of the
[Republican]{.mark} conference voted against a bill that]{.underline}
fundamentally [seeks to support]{.underline} both [NATO]{.underline} and
Ukraine [highlights a marked **foreign policy evolution** in the
Republican Party]{.underline}. "We now are really seeing the true impact
of deep, deep political polarization, where it is better to harm the
other side than do what's right for the country," said Heather Conley,
president of the German Marshall Fund. "This deep domestic polarization
has now crept into foreign and security policy. There has always been
strong bipartisan support for NATO, but everything now has become
polarized and can be weaponized against the other side, even if it
supports U.S. national security interests." Many European diplomats
breathed a sigh of relief when President Biden, a staunch Atlanticist,
denied Trump another term in 2020. Now, 16 months later, Biden's role in
marshaling Western allies behind Ukraine --- and his recent vow to
protect "every inch of NATO territory" --- has alleviated doubt in
Europe about U.S. commitments, at least in the short term. But Europeans
who were heartened by the outcome of the last American election are
beginning to eye upcoming contests, including this year's midterms and
the 2024 presidential race. Their apprehension about a Republican
takeover of Congress, which could revive Trump's brand of foreign
policy, is offset by hope that Russia's invasion of Ukraine will
strengthen the Republican Party's internationalist wing and compel the
party to lock arms with Europe. "I'm very concerned about the situation
in America --- the split of the society, the concentration on domestic
issues, the underestimation of the importance of America's international
role," said Thomas de Maizière, a former center-right lawmaker and
high-ranking government minister in Germany who co-chaired a NATO
working group convened in 2020. "But there are Republicans we work
excellently with, and I would expect them to take on a larger role if
their party takes power." Whether that assessment reflects an accurate
reading of Republican politics is an open question. The answer, however,
is existential in Europe, where the fallout from the war in Ukraine has
showcased the importance of the United States and the limits of
aspirations for European autonomy on matters of technology and defense,
according to lawmakers and diplomats. Flash points are already coming
into view. In 2020, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg started a
working group aimed at strengthening NATO. The group's final product,
"NATO 2030: United for a New Era," included proposals, such as the
creation of a Center for Democratic Resilience, that have been scorned
by pro-Trump Republicans, including many of the 63 Republicans who
recently voted against the House resolution affirming support for NATO.
The outcome of that vote surprised even Trump's former ambassador to
NATO, Kay Bailey Hutchison, who argued that the U.S. commitment to the
alliance has remained ironclad across administrations, despite bellicose
rhetoric. "I was nonplussed by that vote," she said in an interview. A
diplomat from a Baltic state, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to
avoid alienating U.S. partners, called the vote a "Trump effect." "But
how many voted for it?" the diplomat added. "The mainstream is clearly
in favor of NATO and strengthening NATO." Similarly, Sen. Thom Tillis
(R-N.C.), the co-chair of the Senate NATO Observer Group, who just
returned from a trip to the alliance's headquarters in Brussels, said
the recent Republican votes against NATO were "poorly timed," but he
dismissed the 63 House Republicans as an "inconsequential" number. Amid
the war in Ukraine, Tillis said, "this is a time where the alliance has
really proven its mettle." Another European diplomat said the war in
Ukraine has caused European nations to address some of the complaints
leveled by Trump, including insufficient spending on defense and
reliance on Russian oil and gas. Those were the two issues raised by the
former president when he criticized Stoltenberg at an alliance summit in
2018. "It should no longer be a big issue for his supporters," the
diplomat said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to be candid on a
sensitive issue. But for some, the changes are not enough. Rep. Warren
Davidson (R-Ohio), who voted against the recent resolution, said he
[[objected]{.mark} not to NATO but [to]{.mark} its **[future
direction]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[which]{.underline}]{.mark} in his
view [[places **too**]{.mark} **[large a]{.mark} [burden]{.mark}**
[on]{.mark} [the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates and involves too much promotion of
specific values. The resolution's affirmation of "unequivocal support"
risks being mistaken for unconditional support, Davidson said. When
asked whether he could envision the United States exiting the alliance
--- as Trump considered with former advisers --- Davidson said the real
issue is rather whether other member nations who are not spending
sufficiently on defense should leave the club. "Is there a point where
America would consider pulling out? It's something we should discuss,"
said Davidson, an Army veteran who was stationed in Germany when the
Berlin Wall fell in 1989. "The better question is whether there's a
point where we would say to other member countries, 'This might not be
your place --- you're disinvited.'" Davidson said he objected in
particular to the resolution's endorsement of the Center for Democratic
Resilience, which he called an "entity designed to meddle in other
countries' domestic politics." Disagreements have broken out among
member nations over the erosion of democracy within the alliance, with
criticism directed in particular at Turkey, Hungary and Poland. A
Central European diplomat said objections to the democracy center
reflect admiration for the likes of Hungary's Viktor Orban in other
Western nations. De Maizière echoed that view, saying his primary
[concern about upcoming]{.underline} U.S. [elections was
that]{.underline} "right-wing [Republicans are **drifting away**
from]{.underline} this [**common path** of **Western
values**]{.underline}."

The midterm dynamic tends to be far stronger in the House than in Senate
contests, where individual candidates matter more. So, [the **focus**
for 2022 is **very much still** on the midterm]{.underline} Senate
[races]{.underline}.

[[Voters]{.mark} [in]{.mark} [seven states]{.mark}]{.underline} will
[[decide]{.mark} who controls the U.S. [Senate]{.mark}]{.underline} in
2023-24: Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina,
Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. If Republicans net even one seat in the fall
midterms, they can block President Joe Biden's judicial, diplomatic and
executive branch appointees for the rest of his term.

While some of those seven states have large populations --- Pennsylvania
is the fifth most populous, Georgia the eighth, North Carolina the
ninth, Arizona the 14th, Wisconsin the 20th, Nevada the 32nd and New
Hampshire the 41st, according to the 2020 census --- [[only]{.mark} a
**[handful]{.mark}** of voters in each state]{.underline} will
[**[decide]{.mark}** [who wins]{.mark} their]{.underline} 2022 [Senate
races]{.underline}.

That is because [**[most voters]{.mark}** are **[reliably]{.mark}
[Republican]{.mark}** [or]{.mark} **reliably
[Dem]{.mark}ocratic**]{.underline}. They may well tell you that they are
independents who cast their votes depending on their evaluation of the
candidates, but that is usually poppycock. [Most are closet partisans
who vote consistently for one party]{.underline} or the other but like
the idea of being "independent."

Since [[each]{.mark} of the seven [state]{.mark}s is]{.underline} almost
[**[evenly divided]{.mark}** between Democrats and
Republicans]{.underline}, those [partisans generally **don't decide**
**who wins**]{.underline}. [It is true **[swing
voters]{.mark}**]{.underline} --- "soft" Democrats, and "soft"
Republicans in those states who [**[have]{.mark} the [power]{.mark}**
[to **pick winners**]{.mark} in any statewide contest]{.underline}.

Traditionally, turnout in midterm elections is significantly below that
in presidential years, so part of the [[parties']{.mark} electoral
[calculations]{.mark} [includes]{.mark}]{.underline} their [[ability to
**turn out**]{.underline}]{.mark} out [**[voters]{.mark}** who otherwise
would **not show up** at the polls]{.underline} in a typical midterm.

So it's fair to ask: [How helpful is analysis]{.underline} [a year away
from]{.underline} the **[midterms]{.underline}**? As it turns out,
[quite a bit]{.underline}.

A look back at [[**political** **analysis** over]{.underline}]{.mark}
the [[last couple]{.mark} of **[decades]{.mark}**]{.underline} [shows
that]{.underline}, [even a year out]{.underline} from the election,
i[t's [possible to]{.mark} accurately [identify]{.mark} the [direction
of]{.mark} an [election]{.mark} cycle]{.underline}, [[even
if]{.mark}]{.underline} the magnitude or
**[[specifics]{.underline}]{.mark}** [are [unclear]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[That's]{.underline} [[great]{.mark} [news for

[midterm]{.underline} [elections]{.underline} [for]{.underline} the
[party out of]{.underline} the [White House and]{.underline} the
[current]{.underline} **[political environment]{.underline}**. And it's
bad news for Democrats hoping for a dramatic rebound next year.

2020 Elections

In November 2019, I laid out four potential scenarios for 2020, in order
of likelihood. A year out from the elections, the most likely outcome
was Democrats winning the White House, Republicans holding the Senate
and Democrats maintaining control of the House. That came within one
Senate seat of being the case.

[While the second most]{.underline} [likely scenario]{.underline} (a
Democratic sweep) [ended up being the]{.underline} final
[result]{.underline}, [it was]{.underline} in [the same]{.underline}
general [direction]{.underline} [of the **first one**]{.underline}. It
wasn't as if, a year out from the election, Republicans were riding high
and then things shifted. [The elections maintained]{.underline} their
[trajectory]{.underline} [for **12 months**]{.underline}, [even through
a **pandemic**]{.underline}.

That [2019 analysis]{.underline} of a Democratic sweep also included an
[ominous warning]{.underline} for Democrats three years before the
midterms: "Such a [sweep]{.underline} would [have]{.underline}
[Democrats riding high]{.underline} [and]{.underline} the [media
pronouncing]{.underline} the [end]{.underline} [of]{.underline} the
[Republican Party]{.underline}. While the election would be more of a
repudiation of Trump, Democrats could declare a legislative mandate for
their most polarizing policies. ... That would set up a potential
backlash election in 2022 allowing the GOP to bounce back."

And [that's where we sit today]{.underline}. [Republicans]{.underline}
[are]{.underline} well-[positioned]{.underline} [to win back
the]{.underline} [House]{.underline} [and]{.underline} the
[Senate]{.underline}, although the latter is more difficult.

2018 Elections

"Democrats haven't struggled to recruit candidates, but this week's
results in Virginia should encourage any wavering House challengers to
get off the sidelines," Inside Elections wrote in November 2017. "Even
so, it remains unclear whether Tuesday's sweeping victories portend a
national electoral wave next year. Democrats are poised to gain seats,
but the most likely outcome ranges from a modest gain in the teens to a
more dramatic political wave."

Indeed, it was the wave that developed as Democrats saw a net gain of 41
seats a year later and regained the House majority. Once again, even
though the magnitude of the cycle wasn't identified a year out, the
conditions for a wave were apparent.

The Senate picture was always a bit murkier considering the GOP lean of
the battleground states. "The Senate is still less likely to flip
control than the House, but Democrats have an easier path after
Alabama," Inside Elections said in January 2018. This was the right
sentiment considering Republicans gained two seats and held their
majority.

2016 elections

"A year out from the 2016 elections, control of the Senate is up for
grabs," Inside Elections wrote in November 2015. "Based on the blue and
purple tinge of the states up this cycle, and presidential election
turnout drawing out more Democratic friendly voters, Democrats are
likely to pick up seats. But there is a broad range of outcomes from
minimal net change to significant Democratic gains." A year later,
Democrats gained two Senate seats.

"Democrats are likely to pick up \[House\] seats but gains depend on
presidential nominees," read an analysis in early January 2016, still 10
months from the elections. I looked at that January because we haven't
always written projections exactly one year out. "At this stage, the
potential House outcomes range from Democratic gains of a couple of
seats to a couple dozen or more seats, based in part on the volatility
at the top of the ticket," according to Inside Elections. In the end,
Democrats gained six House seats.

Once again, there was more than an inkling about what would happen
nearly three years out from the next midterm elections. "The margin
after the 2016 elections is also important because 2018 will likely be a
challenging election for the party in control of the White House. ...
\[If\] the GOP wins the White House, 2018 could be a difficult year for
the party." And that's what happened.

2014 elections

"A 'typical' midterm currently seems to be shaping up for next year,"
Stuart Rothenberg wrote in CQ Roll Call in early December 2013. "That
means that the president will be a drag on his party's nominees in
competitive contests and Democrats will spend much of their time on the
defensive, trying to convince voters that they should not base their
votes on their dissatisfaction with \[Barack\] Obama's performance."

"The current trajectory of the midterms now strongly favors the GOP,"
Rothenberg added. A year out from the midterm elections, Republicans
were projected to gain three to six Senate seats, and "a small net House
gain" was materializing. In the end, the GOP gained a whopping nine
Senate seats and 13 House seats. Once again, the very early projections
were off in the magnitude, not the direction.

2012 elections

This cycle had a more pronounced difference between the year-out
analysis and the final results, although it was in a cycle with minimal
changes overall.

In November 2011, the most likely outcome was a GOP gain of two to four
Senate seats, according to what was then the Rothenberg Political
Report. Democrats ended up gaining two Senate seats, coupled with
Obama's reelection.

The early House outlook was more muddled because it was a redistricting
cycle. Sound familiar? Close to half of the districts hadn't been
redrawn and finalized in November 2011. A year later, Democrats gained
eight House seats, recapturing a few of the 63 they lost in 2010.

2010 elections

A year after Obama's historic election in 2008, it was becoming clear
Democrats were going to have problems in his first midterm.

"Substantial Republican gains now look almost inevitable, with net
Democratic losses likely to exceed a dozen," read the Rothenberg
Political Report in mid-December 2009. "While Democratic control of the
House is not yet at risk, losses of 15-20 seats are likely, and that
target range could well grow with additional Democratic retirements and
voter anger."

GOP prospects kept ticking upward over the next year to a final,
pre-election projection of a 55- to 65-seat gain for the party.
Republicans ended up with a net pickup of 63 seats and recaptured the
House majority they had lost four years earlier.

It was a similar story on the Senate side, but on a smaller scale. The
tide had started to shift in favor of the GOP. "With the landscape
changing noticeably over the summer, Democrats can no longer assume that
they will have a net gain of seats in next year's midterm elections,"
the Rothenberg Report stated in October 2009. A year before the
midterms, the most likely outcome ranged from a GOP gain of two seats to
a Democratic gain of two seats. Republicans ended up with a net gain of
six Senate seats in what was as close to a textbook wave election as it
gets.

2008 elections

After getting swamped in the 2006 elections, Republicans were hoping to
bounce back and turn the page from unpopular, outgoing President George
W. Bush. But by November 2007, it was pretty clear that wasn't going to
happen.

"At this point, a net Democratic gain looks extremely likely. But for
Congress-watchers, it makes a huge difference if Democrats gain a seat
or two --- or six or seven," read the Rothenberg Report's analysis of
the Senate landscape. "Right now, 3-5 seems like the most likely guess,
with Virginia, New Hampshire, Colorado and Louisiana currently the most
likely seats to turn." A year later, all but Louisiana from that group
flipped, and Democrats gained eight seats overall.

"Democrats continue to have several advantages in the fight for the
House: retirements/open seats, money and the broad national
environment," according to the January 2008 report. "Growing concerns
about the economy could also drag down the President's (and his party's)
numbers further, giving Democratic candidates another powerful message."
We hadn't published a likely range for the House yet, but Democrats
ended up gaining 21 seats overall.

2006 elections

"National atmospherics strongly favor Democrats. President Bush's
ratings are down and a majority of Americans believe things in the
country are 'off on the wrong track,'" the Rothenberg Report wrote in
late October 2005. "The GOP's danger next year is that, because of the
national environment, Democrats win most or all of the close races. That
often happens (as it did in 1980, 1986 and 1994), and if it does in
2006, Democrats could add as many as five or even six senators."

And that's what happened. Even though Bush won reelection in 2004, the
tide completely turned against him shortly thereafter. (His response to
Hurricane Katrina in August 2005 might have been the final straw.)
Democrats ended up gaining the six Senate seats and the majority.

On the House side, the wave was still developing. "Democrats don't have
as many top tier candidates as they need to make major gains. That means
that their ability to pick up the 15 seats that they need for a majority
depends on the size of the midterm wave," the report stated. "Democrats
still have the potential for major gains (even taking the House), but
their current prospects are somewhat lower."

In January 2006, the Rothenberg team projected a Democrat gain of five
to eight seats with a bias toward even greater Democratic gains. Along
that trajectory, Democrats gained 31 House seats (and the majority) 11
months later.

2004 elections

"Barring events that change the dynamics next year, President Bush will
begin as a favorite for re-election even with the country's
polarization. Over on Capitol Hill, Democrats remain long-shots in their
efforts to retake the US House and the US Senate," read the Rothenberg
Political Report in December 2003.

"Unless there are more GOP retirements or a national Democratic surge,
it is still very difficult to see the Republicans losing the House next
year," the report said in November 2003. "Fewer than three dozen races
appear very interesting, and the sheer lack of competitive districts
almost guarantees Republican control of the House after the 2004
elections." A year later, Republicans gained a modest three seats and
expanded their majority slightly.

It was a somewhat similar story on the Senate side. "The numbers don't
look great for the Democrats these days," the Rothenberg Report noted at
the beginning of January 2004. "We still believe the Republicans should
make Senate gains, most likely in the range of one to three seats." Ten
months later, Republicans expanded their majority by four seats.

2002 elections

"National events --- from the terrorist attacks of September 11 and the
war on terrorism to the economy --- are likely to play an important role
in next year\'s elections, but it is far too early to know exactly how
they will impact each race," read the Rothenberg Report's November 2001
Senate overview. "Given candidate recruiting and initial vulnerability
assessments, we could see either party making a small gain." A year
later, Republicans saw a net gain of two Senate seats.

"Bush's popularity, the economy, the war on terrorism and other factors
will determine whether the Republicans can avoid the midterm losses that
normally find the president's party," according to a January 2002
analysis. "At this point, the most likely outcome seems to be a small
Democratic gain that would leave the Republicans in tenuous control of
the House."

That's close to what happened. With help from a continued post-9/11
environment and redistricting, Bush's GOP gained eight House seats,
bucking the typical historical trend for the president's party in a
midterm.

your thoughts. how do you explain this discrepancy? \>\> [Jonathan, over
the last couple of cycles, we have learned nothing other than that
conventional wisdom is not what it used to be. And as you said, from the
break, that **[you would expect republicans]{.mark} to [have]{.mark} a
significant [advantage]{.mark}** **[given]{.mark}** President Biden's
[**approval ratings**, rate of inflation and gas prices and
etcetera.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[That is not
happening]{.mark}.]{.underline} As you mention, the generic ballot has
one or two points. it is basically frozen there over the course of the
last few months, inflation numbers have ticked up. and not in a positive
direction, for the current administration. But we are seeing, I think,
is a combination of January six and supreme court really beginning to
focus the mind of key constituencies in this electorate. We have seen
them evolving their views in the last several weeks. [We have seen an
**[11-point shift]{.mark} in the** cnn **polling** that was released a
few weeks ago among independents.]{.underline} We\'ve seen an 11-point
shift among women. When we have seen a significant shift lot of meng 11
points among folks 65 years and older. In addition to that, as you know
we have been measuring the enthusiasm of young people for 20 years now.
We are seeing numbers that look like 2018, if not exceeding that. That
was a high-water mark, 15 years of participation. All of, that again,
you can\'t \-- you have to put work, it but I think the environment is
far different than you would expect a traditional cycle. Let\'s talk
more about this environment, history shows that in recent memory, only
one time has the president's party not lost seats in the midterm
election of the first term. That was in 2002, that was President George
W. Bush. the headwinds democrats are facing, at least inside inflation
and everything, they were already strong, you have inflation. [When I'm
wondering, Rachel, is the overturning of roe the threat from Justice
Thomas to contraception, and marriage equality, on top of a whole bunch
of other things, is that enough to blunt the impact of peoples fear of
inflation in terms of helping democrats of the ballot box in
November?]{.underline} \>\> John, you know the reporting that I've done
on this has really focused on, [okay there is this midterm
fundamentalism, we know they\'re gonna be against the left, we know that
this time democracy, the **[survival of democracy]{.mark}
[depends]{.mark} [on]{.mark} their [electoral
survival]{.mark}.**]{.underline} so, you know, we think about these
fundamentals that drive the midterm effect, it\'s a preference for
change, it\'s a bias against the status quo, it\'s a lack of enthusiasm
to the party in power. we talked a little bit how we\'re seeing those
things reset. what you need to do is set in 2002, the exception that you
cite, the exception occurred because the national narrative was
destructed from domestic inviting in normal politics to national crisis.
[So, democrats really want to make sure that they are hammering the
abnormality of the moment, the last thing they want to do is \-- a long
lines of inflation and normal politics, they have to **make it very
clear to the American electorate that [we\'re facing an]{.mark}**
**[existential crisis]{.mark}.**]{.underline} here\'s the nice thing,
I'll tell you, it\'s not usually, there\'s some component of this media,
it\'s a joke that the out party will put up, or they\'re ex-president
missed media. no one misses trump. no one. there is no missed media
effect. I think as long as we remind the electorate white Shane means,
it.

#### Dems set to win Senate, but it's still a toss-up

**Silver 6-30** (Nate Silver is the founder and editor in chief of
FiveThirtyEight and the author of "The Signal and the Noise: Why So Many
Predictions Fail --- But Some Don't." "Why Republicans Are Favored To
Win The House, But Not The Senate",
https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-republicans-are-favored-to-win-the-house-but-not-the-senate/)LR

[[Republicans are]{.mark} substantial [favorites]{.mark} to take over
the U.S. House of Representatives following this November's midterm
elections, [but]{.mark} **[the U.S. Senate is much more
competitive]{.mark}**]{.underline}, according to FiveThirtyEight's 2022
midterm election forecast, which launched today. [Democrats are also
favored to hang on to the governorships in a trio of swing states in the
Rust Belt --- Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan --- although they are
significant underdogs to win high-profile gubernatorial races in Georgia
and Texas against Republican incumbents.]{.underline} The split
diagnosis reflects the difference between macro- and micro-level
conditions. The national environment is quite poor for Democrats. Of
course, this is typical for the president's party, which has lost seats
in the House in all but two of the past 21 midterm elections. But
Democrats are also saddled with an unpopular President Biden and a
series of challenges for the country, including inflation levels that
haven't been seen in decades, the lingering effects of the still-ongoing
COVID-19 pandemic and fraying trust in civic institutions --- caused, in
part, by Republican efforts to overturn the results of the 2020
election. [[Democrats,]{.mark} as a predominantly urban party, also
[face a longstanding problem]{.mark} in the Senate, where every state
has equal representation regardless of its population, resulting in a
substantial built-in bias toward white, rural states.]{.underline} And
[[although Democrats are very slightly better off]{.mark} following the
redistricting process in the House than they were under the 2020 maps,
t[here are still more Republican-leaning seats than Democratic-leaning
ones]{.mark}]{.underline}. True, [the political environment is
dynamic]{.underline}. The Supreme Court's decision last week to overturn
Roe v. Wade is too recent to be fully reflected in polls, but there are
reasons to think it will help Democrats. Roe, which granted the
constitutional right to abortion, was a popular precedent, and
Democratic voters are more likely than Republican ones to say the
decision will encourage them to vote at the midterms.
[[Moreover]{.mark}, in striking down [Roe]{.mark} [and other]{.mark}
popular [laws]{.mark} like restrictions against the concealed carry of
firearms, [the Supreme Court has in some ways undermined]{.mark} [one of
the]{.mark} traditional [reasons]{.mark} that the [president's party
tends to lose seats at the midterms]{.mark}.]{.underline} Typically,
voters like some degree of balance: They do not want one party to have
unfettered control of all levers of government. But [the Supreme Court,
with its [6-3]{.mark} conservative [majority]{.mark}, is a remin[der of
how much power Republicans have even if they don't control the White
House]{.mark}]{.underline}. The insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan.
6 can also serve as a reminder to voters about what might happen if the
Electoral College certification process takes place in 2024 amid
Republican control of both chambers of Congress.1 Democrats have had
trouble getting the public to treat threats to democracy as a high
priority, but polls do show that the public is sympathetic to the
Democrats' case, especially after the recent congressional hearings on
the events of Jan. 6. So, this is not a typical, low-stakes midterm
election. On the contrary, there are strong forces tugging at each side
of the rope, some of which are potentially of existential importance.
But Democrats' majorities in both chambers of Congress are narrow, the
historical precedent toward the president's party losing seats is
strong, and polls so far --- such as the generic congressional ballot,
which asks voters which party they would support in an election ---
suggest that voters slightly prefer Republican control of Congress. In
the Senate and gubernatorial races, by contrast, individual factors can
matter more. And the GOP has nominated --- or is poised to nominate ---
candidates who might significantly underperform a "generic" Republican
based on some combination of inexperience, personal scandals or having
articulated unpopular conservative positions. This is not a new problem
for Republicans: underqualified or fringy candidates have cost them
seats in the Senate in other recent cycles[. So let's briefly run
through the model's forecast for House, Senate and gubernatorial races.
Then I'll describe some changes to the model since 2020]{.underline} ---
which are modest this year but reflect how congressional races are
changing in an increasingly polarized political environment. Democratic
hopes of keeping the Senate are much more viable, however. Part of this,
as I mentioned, is because they appear to have stronger candidates in a
handful of key races. Pennsylvania, for instance --- which is an open
seat after the retirement of Republican Sen. Pat Toomey --- is
ordinarily the sort of seat that you'd expect Republicans to win since
Pennsylvania is a purple state in a Republican year. However, the
Democratic candidate, Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, is ahead of Republican
Mehmet Oz, the doctor and TV personality, in every poll conducted so
far. The model, though, is trained to be a bit skeptical given the
fundamentals of the race, so it hedges against those polls and, at this
point, has determined that Pennsylvania is best thought of as a toss-up.
Still, that means Democrats have roughly a 50-50 chance of gaining a
GOP-held Senate seat, offsetting potential losses elsewhere. Indeed, our
forecast sees the overall Senate landscape to be about as competitive as
it gets. The Deluxe forecast literally has Senate control as a 50-50
tossup. [T[h]{.mark}e Classic and Lite forecasts show Democrats as very
slight favorites to keep the Senate, meanwhile, with a 59 and a 62
percent chance, respectively]{.underline}. ![Ball-swarm (or bee-swarm)

outcomes from our Deluxe model's 40,000 simulations, where Democrats

53 percent chance.](media/image2.png){width="6.0in"
height="3.577777777777778in"} **[[It's a toss-up for the
Senate]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [Part of this is because Senate terms
last for six years, and so [most of these seats]{.mark} were last
[contested]{.mark} in 2016]{.underline},3 a mediocre year for Democrats
in which they lost the popular vote for the House and also lost Senate
races in swing states such as Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Arizona. Of
the 35 Senate seats up for grabs in November, 21 are currently held by
Republicans. True, most of these are not competitive, but in addition to
their chances to gain a GOP-held seat in Pennsylvania, Democrats also
have credible chances in Wisconsin and North Carolina (and outside
chances in Ohio and Florida, although those are a stretch given how
GOP-leaning both states have become). Republicans don't have any
surefire pickups, meanwhile. Our model regards their best chances as
being in Georgia, but that race is rated as a toss-up. [And the races in
Arizona and New Hampshire merely lean toward the Democratic incumbent,
meaning they are still highly plausible GOP pickup opportunities. Still,
[the picture isn't as bad]{.mark} as you might expect for
Democrats.]{.underline} If the political environment really deteriorates
for them, they'll be in trouble, lose most of the competitive races and
even blue states like Colorado could come into play. [[But if things are
merely pretty bad for Democrats instead of catastrophic,]{.mark} the
[outcome]{.mark} of the Senate [will remain uncertain]{.mark} enough
that stronger candidates could make the difference for
them.]{.underline}

**Smith 7-22** (Allan Smith is a political reporter for NBC News. B.S in

<https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/arizonas-gop-governor-primary-brawl-tries-define-real-republican-rcna38825)LR>

QUEEN CREEK, Ariz. --- [The closing days of Arizona's close, contentious
GOP primary for governor have turned into an all-out slugfest over which
candidate is the most authentically Republican. Kari Lake, a former
newscaster backed by former President Donald Trump, says opponent Karrin
Taylor Robson's unwillingness to fully embrace Trump's stolen election
lie makes her the RINO, or "Republican in name only."]{.underline}
[Taylor Robson, a real estate developer who worked in former President
Ronald Reagan's White House, says it's Lake who's the fake, given her
more recent turn to hard-line Trumpism.]{.underline} While it's hardly
new for a GOP primary to feature allegations of being a "RINO," or for
candidates to litigate issues of political authenticity, [[the contest
provides]{.mark} one of the [purest tests]{.mark} yet of how highly
Republican voters prize fealty to Trump and allegiance to his claims of
a stolen election. More broadly, the contest will reveal who can
credibly lay claim to the mantle of "Republican" in a party where Trump
is still the most dominant and influential figure.]{.underline} It's a
debate playing out not just in Arizona, but nationwide and tested in
primaries spanning from state Senate contests to congressional races.
Here in the Grand Canyon State, one that has reliably elected
Republicans to statewide office for decades but in which Democrats have
recently turned their fortunes around, how the conservative mantle is
defined could go a long way in determining which party controls the
governor's mansion in what is now a critical presidential swing state.
Former Rep. Matt Salmon, an Arizona Republican who ran for governor but
dropped out and endorsed Taylor Robson last month, said after a recent
Taylor Robson campaign event here that Lake and Taylor Robson are both
talking about similar issues like undocumented immigration, inflation
and supporting law enforcement on the stump, but Lake is building her
case for being a true Republican solely off of her stance on 2020,
hoping voters ignore other contradictions from her past. "[But what
[people are looking for]{.mark} is, 'OK, [who's]{.mark} [the real
deal]{.mark}?'" Salmon, a co-founder of the House Freedom Caucus, said.
"And you got one candidate that says that they had a born-again
experience, a come-to-Jesus moment, and now is the most conservative
thing since sliced bread.]{.underline} The problem is, you can't find
one conservative thing that candidate ever did before she announced her
governorship." [[Whether]{.mark} [Lake or Taylor]{.mark} Robson [is
successful]{.mark} in convincing more voters that they are the true
Republican will have major implications for both Trump's standing in the
party and his continued efforts to overhaul how elections are conducted
in one of the most pivotal presidential swing states.]{.underline} The
Arizona primary is the latest in a series of high-stakes gubernatorial
contests taking place in states he needs to win in 2024 and where he has
sought to make 2020 the defining issue of the campaign. So far he's had
mixed results. [But her [standing]{.mark} as a conservative [has been
increasingly called into question]{.mark} as years-old social media
clips and photos that contradict positions she now takes have surfaced.
[Taylor Robson calls her a "fake"]{.mark} and an "actress." Taylor
[Robson]{.mark}, who polling suggests is within striking distance, is
winning over more traditional Republicans in the state and has the
backing of Republican Gov. Doug Ducey and former Vice President Mike
Pence. (]{.underline}Pence and Trump are holding dueling Arizona rallies
for their preferred candidates Friday.) [Her path to [victory is
twofold]{.mark}]{.underline}: convincing enough voters who worry Lake
won't govern as she promises to come join her side while maintaining a
more moderate base that is worried Lake will. [[But in recent
weeks]{.mark}, Taylor [Robson]{.mark} and other conservatives [have
highlighted]{.mark} a number of [past positions]{.mark} and
[statements]{.mark} [that don't line up]{.mark} with how Lake is
campaigning now.]{.underline} A donor to former President Barack Obama's
first presidential campaign, Lake, who has repeatedly cast doubt on the
legitimacy of her state's elections, expressed support for voting by
cell phone in 2016. Now attacking "the transgender movement" and "woke
gender activists," Lake previously offered sympathetic views of gender
transition as a reporter, calling one story "inspiring." And though she
has blasted drag performers as dangerous for kids, a local drag queen
said Lake allowed her daughter to attend a drag show. (Lake's campaign
said the drag queen was performing as an impersonator rather than in
drag.)

President Donald Trump, won the GOP primary on Tuesday with well over 50
percent of the vote. Meanwhile, Cortez Masto handily beat her Democratic
opponents with about 90 percent support. Recent polls suggest the
incumbent has an edge in the race, but Nevada has been leaning toward
the GOP, giving Republicans hope of winning the seat in November\'s
midterm race. [[Polling]{.mark} [and news analysis]{.mark} site
[FiveThirtyEight\'s]{.mark} average of recent polls for the Nevada

Meanwhile, FiveThirtyEight also assesses that Nevada has a 2.5-point
lean in favor of Republicans, compared with the rest of the country.
However, the most recent poll carried out in Nevada shows Cortez Masto
with a wide double-digit lead over her Trump-backed challenger. [The
