### France Says No

#### France is against "humiliating Russia", they'll hesitate on anything too harsh

John **Haltiwanger**, 7-18-20**22**, \"Former NATO chief rips into
Macron for his \'disastrous\' suggestion Putin shouldn\'t be humiliated
in Ukraine,\" Business Insider,
https://www.businessinsider.com/former-nato-chief-rips-into-macron-over-approach-to-ukraine-putin-2022-7,
accessed 7-20-2022//cpd

Anders Fogh Rasmussen, who was [secretary-general of NATO]{.underline}
from 2009 to 2014, did not pull any punches in his [assessment of French
President Emmanuel Macron\'s approach to the Ukraine war and Russian
President Vladimir Putin.]{.underline}

In a new interview with the Atlantic, Rasmussen was especially critical
[of **Macron\'s \"disastrous\" suggestion that the West should avoid
humiliating Putin in Ukraine** to keep the door open for a diplomatic
resolution to the conflict, while excoriating France in terms of the
military aid its provided to Kyiv in comparison to other Western
powers.]{.underline} He also **[took aim at Macron\'s \"unsuccessful\"
efforts at \"telephone diplomacy with Putin.\"]{.underline}**

Rasmussen, who is also a former prime minister of Denmark, said, \"[The
UK]{.underline} has been an outstanding partner for Ukraine. Next to the
US, the UK has been a driving force in helping Ukraine. This [should be
seen as a contrast to the efforts of another big European country,
namely France]{.underline} --- partly because of [President Emmanuel
Macron making those very strange statements about a need to avoid
humiliating Putin and because of his telephone diplomacy with Putin:
unsuccessful, I would say.\"]{.underline}

\"If you assess the weapons deliveries from different countries to
Ukraine, **[France has delivered almost nothing]{.underline}**. The
scale of French deliveries is equivalent to what Denmark has
offered---valued at \$160 million, according to the Kiel Institute for
the World Economy,\" Rasmussen added. \"In comparison, Britain has been
outstanding.\"

[**Speaking on his opposition to giving Putin what Macron described as
an \"exit ramp**,\" the former NATO chief said that the West \"reacted
too mildly and we sent the wrong message]{.underline}\" to the Russian
leader following Russia\'s invasions of Georgia in 2008 and Ukraine in
2014.

\"He calculated that [he could, almost without any cost, grab land from
his neighbors]{.underline},\" Rasmussen said of Putin, adding, \"**[That
is why Macron\'s statement is so disastrous.]{.underline}** [It suggests
that we are approaching a new world order where it\'s not the rule of
law that matters but the rule of the strongest.]{.underline} If Putin
can get away with taking land from Ukraine, that\'s horrendous---because
what next?\"

Rasmussen warned that i**[f Putin is able to get what he wants in
Ukraine then it would send a \"very bad signal\" to China regarding
Taiwan.]{.underline}**

\"The Chinese are following the developments in Ukraine very closely
because [if Putin can get away with taking Crimea, and maybe the Donbas,
and that is settled in a peace deal, then China might interpret that as
an invitation to take Taiwan by force,\"]{.underline} he said.

**[This is why Putin shouldn\'t be offered an exit ramp in the
war,]{.underline}** Rasmussen said, and should instead be told that if
he wants \"to get out of this mess, get out of Ukraine.\"

During an interview with French media in June, **[Macron said, \"We must
not humiliate Russia so that the day when the fighting stops we can
build an exit ramp through diplomatic means.\"]{.underline}**

### Germany Says No

#### Russian deterrence fails- Germany's tendency to appease Russia wrecks NATO consensus or stalls negotiations

Peter **Rough**, 6-16-20**22**, \"Germany's New Resolve on Russia Is
Already Flagging,\" Foreign Policy,
https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/06/16/germany-scholz-zeitenwende-russia-ukraine-war-defense-security-bundeswehr-nato-military/,
accessed 7-20-2022//cpd

[When German Chancellor Olaf Scholz stood before his country's
parliament in the first days after the Russian invasion of
Ukraine]{.underline} and announced a Zeitenwende---or turn of an
era---in German foreign policy, his country was agog. So were Germany
watchers around the world. The country, Scholz announced, would
immediately start rebuilding its military, supplying Ukraine with
weapons, and eliminating its energy dependence on Russia. In one speech,
he overturned not only decades of Russia policy but also German
restraint and pacifism in security and defense. Scholz had taken the
initiative without consulting anyone other than his finance minister,
flooring even senior members of his own Social Democratic Party, which
has a long record advocating for appeasing Russia. [For a brief moment,
a dramatic shift seemed in the offing.]{.underline}

**[Alas, the shift has not come to pass.]{.underline}** In Berlin last
week, German officials and observers described the speech to me as a
moment in time rather than a shift in course. In a way, this is
unsurprising. A former mayor of Hamburg, Scholz led his party to victory
in last year's election by leaning into the Hanseatic reputation for
quiet competence, prudence, and composure. In other words, he sold
himself as another version of his predecessor, Angela Merkel, who was
known for her understated style and technocratic mastery[. Lacking
experience in geopolitics, Scholz promised little new in foreign
policy.]{.underline}

[His skills served Scholz well in the campaign, but they have proved a
liability during a major European war.]{.underline} As a former finance
minister, Scholz's initial reflex after learning of the Russian invasion
was to flood the zone with money, including a 100 billion euro (\$108
billion) fund to bolster Germany's armed forces. As a Social Democrat,
his inclination since his uncharacteristically bold speech has been to
try to manage, rather than confront, Russia. In effect, [Scholz has
attempted to substitute spending for leadership.]{.underline} [**The
implications for Ukraine are dire**: Russian President Vladimir Putin
may not have won the war, but he may yet win the
peace]{.underline}---[especially if Scholz teams up with French
President Emmanuel Macron, who has been pushing for an end to the war at
terms favorable enough to Putin that he is spared any
"humiliation."]{.underline} To that end, Scholz and Macron will travel
to Kyiv this week with Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi and Romanian
President Klaus Iohannis.

**[Putin has long viewed Germany as ripe for
exploitation.]{.underline}** For far too long, [the German political
class prided itself for its supposedly patient, even-keeled approach
toward Moscow]{.underline} that rose above what it saw as the unrefined
fears and passions of its Eastern European allies. Over the years,
[Berlin forged a number of agreements, formulas, and formats it believed
would appease and satiate Putin.]{.underline} Unable to imagine a
full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, **[Germany either opposed
deterrence as a hurdle for dialogue or ignored the balance of power
altogether.]{.underline}**

**[This posture]{.underline}**---[lukewarm support for Ukraine,
eagerness to strike a deal with Putin]{.underline}, the hope to get back
to business as usual---**[will set Europe back by years.]{.underline}**

To be sure, Russia's invasion has rattled German society. The German
press has described it as a "9/11 moment," with polls suggesting a
significant shift in public attitudes. For example, 52 percent of
Germans now support the continued basing of U.S. nuclear weapons in
Germany, up from only 14 percent last year.

When key voices such as German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, a
member of the Greens, and the parliamentarian Norbert Röttgen of the
opposition Christian Democrats offer robust defenses of Ukraine, they
are channeling a significant cross-section of society[. Many Germans do
not believe that a sustainable peace in Europe is possible without a
serious setback for Russia and its imperialist aims.]{.underline}

Yet [little of this finds expression in German policy]{.underline}, as
set by Scholz. To be sure, he has not gone as far as
[Macron]{.underline}, who [has suggested Ukraine surrender territory and
warned the West against "humiliating" Putin.]{.underline} But **[the
German reflex to answer Putin's escalation by building diplomatic
offramps is already reasserting itself]{.underline}**. Scholz has
initiated several calls with Putin, most recently a joint call with
Macron that lasted 80 minutes and prioritized a cease-fire and solving
the global commodity crisis. [He is also reportedly reversing an earlier
promise to station extra troops in Lithuania as part of NATO deterrence
of any Russian attack on the Baltic states]{.underline}. Putin almost
certainly interprets such moves as expressions of flagging Western
resolve. In the days after the Scholz-Macron call, for example, he
doubled down on attacking Ukrainian grain facilities.

At the same time, [German military assistance to Ukraine remains
paltry.]{.underline} [Berlin reportedly failed to meaningfully supply
Ukraine with any weapons]{.underline} in April and May and has yet to
deliver a single heavy weapon since the start of the war. Although a few
major systems are expected to reach Ukraine later this summer, the real
prize---an advanced anti-aircraft system---won't deploy until this fall,
at which point German intelligence assesses Russia may have already
completed its conquest of the Donbas. The scuttlebutt in Berlin is that
this is intentional: [Scholz does not want footage of German equipment
engaging Russian forces to be published]{.underline}. (That Russian
weapons manufactured with German machine tools and software are killing
Ukrainians doesn't seem to be of much concern in Berlin.)

[**The push for diplomacy and neglect of hard power are endemic to
German foreign policy**, but in the case of Ukraine, there is an
additional complication in play.]{.underline} Since the end of the Cold
War, **[Berlin has treated Ukraine as a mere plank of its Russia
policy]{.underline}**. When former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev,
now deputy chairman of Russia's Security Council, said in the days
before the war that the West would stand down because it believes
["Russia is more important than Ukraine," he could easily have been
describing Germany.]{.underline} It has become sport among the Berlin
media to press Scholz and his defense minister, Christine Lambrecht, on
their support for a Ukrainian victory, a goal that both refuse to
endorse.

[The fact that **Berlin is awash in rumors of secret negotiations with
Russia** suggests Germany would prefer to disappoint Ukraine than
humiliate Russia]{.underline}---whatever that may mean. For example, if
Putin offers to lift the blockade of Odesa in return for sanctions
relief or pause hostilities in recognition of a new line of contact,
voices for accommodation will only grow.

**[The accommodationists are emboldened by an unlikely ally: the United
States.]{.underline}** Just like Scholz and Lambrecht[, U.S. officials
have lately shied away from endorsing a Ukrainian victory.]{.underline}
In private with their German counterparts, senior Biden administration
officials have gone a step further, stating explicitly that [Washington
is not aiming for victory, either]{.underline}. When the Biden
administration embraces Germany, it is less a tactic to flatter Berlin
into taking a stronger line and more a reflection of general agreement
between the two governments.

This posture---lukewarm support for Ukraine, eagerness to strike a deal
with Putin, the hope to get back to business as usual---will set Europe
back by years, perhaps even decades. [The initial goodwill bought by
Germany for suspending the Nord Stream 2 pipeline from Russia is
fleeting,]{.underline} especially if any deal over Ukraine includes
sanctions relief and the return to full oil and gas deliveries. **[Any
such deal is sure to kill any remaining solidarity and
trust]{.underline}** underpinning the European Union. Even if they are
not outright destabilized by the war, Eastern European states such as
Poland and the Baltics will, in the future, see an EU led by France and
Germany less as a community of values and more as an economic
arrangement held together by euros and cents. The war in Ukraine may
have badly mauled the Russian military, but if Putin appears confident,
it is because **[Scholz---along with Macron---may yet help him snatch
victory from the jaws of defeat.]{.underline}** If so, it will be even
clearer that the Zeitenwende was no such thing.

#### Germany's reluctance to punish Russia will stall any cooperation with NATO

Judy **Dempsey**, 1-24-20**22**, \"Why Germany Is Undermining NATO Unity
on Russia,\" Carnegie Europe,
https://carnegieeurope.eu/2022/01/26/why-germany-is-undermining-nato-unity-on-russia-pub-86279,
accessed 7-20-2022//cpd

As Russia continues its military buildup along Ukraine's borders,
[NATO]{.underline} and the EU are [trying to project a strong, united
front on these extraordinary and dangerous developments.]{.underline}
But **[Germany is undermining that unity,]{.underline}** [leaving the
West weaker and more divided]{.underline}. Below, Strategic Europe
editor-in-chief Judy Dempsey digs into what's driving Germany's actions
on this latest crisis.

WHY IS [GERMANY RELUCTANT TO FOLLOW NATO ALLIES]{.underline} ON UKRAINE?

Publicly, [Berlin toes the NATO line on sending troops]{.underline} and
equipment to the Baltic states and Romania in order to boost the
alliance's eastern flank. In practice, [it does not want to send any
defensive weapons to Ukraine.]{.underline} It blocked Estonia from
sending such equipment, which had been made in Germany, and a UK
aircraft carrying military equipment to Ukraine detoured around German
airspace. **[The German political establishment believes such moves will
destabilize Europe and make it more difficult to have a dialogue with
Russia.]{.underline}**

BUT ISN'T RUSSIA TRYING TO DESTABILIZE UKRAINE?

[Germany doesn't see it that way. There is a part of **the German
establishment that sees Ukraine through the prism of
Russia**.]{.underline} For historical reasons, this group views Ukraine,
Belarus, and Georgia as a cordon sanitaire between Europe and Russia.
[There's a legacy of]{.underline} both centuries-old rivalry and
**[cooperation between Russia and Germany.]{.underline}** And there's
the immense historical guilt of Germany's role in World War II. Ukraine
and Belarus suffered horribly under Adolf Hitler's occupation, but
somehow, these facts don't enter into the public discourse. [The
historical guilt is centered on Russia, and **German politicians often
refer to this legacy.**]{.underline}

DON'T BELARUS, GEORGIA, AND UKRAINE ONE DAY WANT TO JOIN BOTH NATO AND
THE EU?

Yes. Joining the EU is a long way off, but that is their goal. That is
what drives the reformers when it comes to strengthening democracy, the
rule of law, and an independent judiciary. That's what scares Russia:
truly independent, democratic countries on its border. And NATO is its
red line. Putin does not want any Eastern European countries joining
this Western security alliance. If they did, the United States would,
from the security and military points of view, dominate not only Western
Europe but also Eastern Europe. Russia would lose any leverage to
influence events among its immediate western neighbors. NATO would
defend these countries if they were threatened or attacked.

That is why Putin is threatening Ukraine and demanding a water-tight
commitment from NATO that Ukraine will not join. He does not want
Ukraine integrated into the Euro-Atlantic structures of NATO or the EU,
nor does he want a secure and democratic Ukraine on his doorstep. The
fear of contagion would be too big.

HOW ARE [NATO ALLIES REACTING TO GERMANY'S RELUCTANCE]{.underline}?

[With anger]{.underline}. [The Baltic states]{.underline} and Central
European [countries believe Germany doesn't understand their security
concerns or Russia's intentions.]{.underline} They believe **[the German
political and business establishments are so close to Russia that they
don't want to upset those decades-long ties.]{.underline}**

DOES [GERMANY'S STANCE HAVE]{.underline} ANY [SUPPORT]{.underline}?

Yes, [from France]{.underline}, but for different reasons. President
Emmanuel [Macron wants a European, not a U.S-led, response to this
crisis.]{.underline} **[He wants Europe to have its own security and
defense policy that would create a kind of "strategic
autonomy."]{.underline}** In Macron's view, [the global geostrategic
context has changed so much that Europe has to develop its own
instruments to defend itself and shape policy.]{.underline} But
**[Germany has no strategic compass]{.underline}**. Because of World War
II, it is locked into a pacifist way of thinking. This explains why it
is uncomfortable with Macron's idea, as are the Baltic states, Poland,
and other Central European countries.

WHY IS THAT?

[The Ukraine crisis has made Central Europe even more pro-NATO and
pro-American because of **Germany's closeness to Russia** and Macron's
ambitions to have a militarily and strategically capable
Europe.]{.underline} These countries will likely put a brake on any
future EU integration, especially when it comes to security, defense,
and foreign policy, where consensus would give way to simple majority
voting under proposed reforms. They don't trust France's intentions,
which they see as weakening Europe's relationship with NATO. **[They
don't trust Berlin because it is seen as too pro-Russia.]{.underline}**
This is bad news for the EU.

### Turkey Says No

#### Turkey uses NATO negotiations as leverage- Finland and Sweden proves he will use the aff as a tradeoff for political gains and stall negotiations- IF they say yes.

Jonathan **Lemire**, 6-28-20**22**, \"There's a strongman holding NATO
hostage. And it's not Putin.,\" POLITICO,
https://www.politico.com/news/2022/06/28/nato-kremlin-turkey-00042756,
accessed 7-20-2022//cpd

[Erdogan has often been the problem child within the
alliance.]{.underline}

Despite objections from Washington, E[rdogan has purchased S-400 air
systems from Russia, helped Iran evade some sanctions and is accused of
letting Hamas and ISIS fighters safely transverse his nation's
territory.]{.underline} **[He stands for reelection next
summer]{.underline}** after two decades in power, [during which he has
strengthened his rule]{.underline} through constitutional changes,
imprisoning many of his alleged critics and cracking down on the media.
**[Some analysts believe he decided that strong-arming NATO would make
for good domestic politics.]{.underline}**

**["Erdogan is NATO's weakest link,"]{.underline}** said Jonathan
Schanzer, senior vice president at the Foundation for Defense of
Democracies. "But Biden has quite a lot on his plate. Too much, in fact.
[Whatever Erdogan thinks he's going to get, he may find that he will
need to get in line. He might gain a concession, but at what
cost?]{.underline} **[Turkey is the reason that several NATO states have
explored an ejection mechanism, which NATO currently
lacks.]{.underline}**"

Erdogan had cozied up with Biden's predecessor, Donald Trump, who
declared in 2019 that he was a "big fan" of Turkey's strongman leader
even though Ankara had just purchased weapons systems from Russia over
the howls of a bipartisan group of lawmakers. Many in Washington
condemned Trump's decision to withdraw U.S. forces from Syria, which led
to a Turkish onslaught of the Kurds, who fought alongside Americans
against Islamic State fighters --- but whom Erdogan has deemed
"terrorists."

Erdogan and Biden met along the sidelines of the G-20 summit last fall
in Rome but did not cross paths at the extraordinary NATO summit in
Brussels this spring, soon after Russia's invasion. [Erdogan has raised
concerns about Swedish support for Kurdish militias and appears intent
on creating a precedent to prevent any NATO ally from backing the
group.]{.underline}

"\[**[Erdogan\] is very good in converting what is good for Turkey into
what is good for Erdogan]{.underline}**," said Soner Cagaptay, a Turkey
expert with the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. "I believe
that [Erdogan is going to use this to boost his popularity before
elections in Turkey]{.underline}."

[Many officials believe that Erdogan's concern about the Kurdish
militants is also a convenient fig leaf to disguise his real hopes ---
to get the Americans to approve a sale of F-16 fighter jets to
Ankara.]{.underline}

"The argument is the 'tell' that the Turks are actually negotiating with
Biden," said Steven Cook of the Council on Foreign Relations.
"[President Erdogan calculates that NATO expansion is more important to
Biden than congressional concerns about sending F-16s to
Turkey]{.underline}."

If Erdogan signs off on any deal, the agreement would, in many ways,
underscore just how badly Putin's invasion has backfired.

Among the Russian leader's justifications for crossing into Ukraine was
to prevent it, or any other Eastern European nation, from joining NATO,
which was formed in the aftermath of World War II as a bulwark to
aggression from the then-Soviet Union. The organization's founding
principle is known as Article Five: that if any one member is attacked,
the rest of the alliance is obligated to come to its defense.

[Putin wagered that]{.underline}, when faced with bonafide Russian
violence and economic hardships stemming from the war, [NATO would
splinter and resist rushing to the aid of a non-member.]{.underline} But
instead, the alliance has rallied together, with many of its members
sending weapons and money to Kyiv's defense.

Biden says NATO is focused on all directions and domains

And while Ukraine itself has wavered on the idea of joining NATO,
Putin's invasion has pushed other European nations, including Finland
and Sweden, to do so.

"[Putin has been counting on, from the beginning, that somehow NATO
would]{.underline} --- and the G-7 would [splinter]{.underline}," Biden
said at the week's first summit, the G-7, in Germany. "But we haven't,
and we're not going to."

#### Turkey is the weak link in NATO, but NATO's consensus structure makes it just as important as the US

Michael **Rubin** 7-7-20**22,** "Russia Aims To Paralyze NATO Without A
Single Shot",
https://www.19fortyfive.com/2022/07/russia-aims-to-paralyze-nato-without-a-single-shot///cpd

[Erdogan may be a cynic and Turkey may no longer be deserving of NATO
membership, but there is little NATO can do]{.underline} for two
reasons: First, there is no mechanism within NATO to expel a wayward
member, and, second, **[the organization governs itself by
consensus]{.underline}**. [There is no difference between the vote of
the United States]{.underline}, [with]{.underline} 330 million people,
[Turkey]{.underline} with 85 million, and North Macedonia with 1.8
million.

[If Erdogan sympathizes more with Russia than the United
States]{.underline}, and all evidence suggests he does, [then he and
Russian President Vladimir Putin gain more power having Turkey as part
of NATO than separate from it because **they can use Turkey's membership
to paralyze the alliance from within.**]{.underline}

**[Putin]{.underline}**, however, **[understands just how mercurial and
egotistical Erdogan is.]{.underline}** [When Erdogan looks in the
mirror, he sees Putin's equal, but when Putin looks at Erdoǧan, he sees
a Chihuahua]{.underline}. Simply put, Putin will never place Russia's
broader security aims in the power of a man he sees as little more than
a yapping dog.

So what is Putin's Plan B for NATO?

It is already unfolding in the Balkans. The Foundation for Defense of
Democracies' Ivana Strander has carefully and repeatedly chronicled the
Kremlin's attempts to interfere domestically in various Balkan
countries, including NATO members such as Montenegro, North Macedonia,
and Croatia. The White House and State Department might compartmentalize
their diplomacy, but Putin is taking a more holistic approach. Simply
put, his strategy appears to shut down NATO action by the veto of its
small members who his forces infiltrate long before it becomes necessary
to confront the defense alliance on the battlefield.

The question for Washington and Brussels, then, is what is the American
and European response? The tendency in both capitals to sigh with relief
when a crisis passes serves NATO poorly when what really transpired with
Turkey was a dry run to destroy NATO from within.

#### Turkey says no, they won't risk their friendship with Russia OR they'll demand something too risky in return

Simon A. **Waldman**, 6-30-20**22**, \"Two-faced Turkey demands a
terrible price for NATO expansion,\" Haaretz,

Ankara figures that the Turkish she-wolf has no chance against the
Russian bear in a head-to-head wrestling match. Instead, [Ankara seeks
both active engagement with Moscow on a bilateral level, but
belligerency through proxies in their overlapping near
abroad.]{.underline}

[This is how that delicate]{.underline}, if not fragile, [balancing act
works.]{.underline} [Turkey buys Russian S400 surface-to-air missiles
and sends ministers to Moscow for strategic discussions, **while seeking
to advance trade relations.**]{.underline} In 2019, before the COVID
crisis hit, the volume of that trade stood at \$23 billion and the two
sides reiterated their goal of making this number reach \$100 billion.
[Energy cooperation is strong]{.underline} with Gazprom having just
signed a [four-year gas deal with Turkey's state energy
company]{.underline} Botas in January this year, the latest advancement
of the Turkstream project, **[the Russia to Turkey natural gas
pipeline]{.underline}**. [Turkey is predicted to receive 1.5 million
Russian tourists this year,]{.underline} [including Putin's
oligarchs]{.underline} who can enjoy Turkey's luxurious resorts without
fear of sanction.

However, Turkey supported the Government of National Accord during the
Second Libyan Civil war, despite Moscow having thrown its lot with its
sworn enemy, General Haftar. Just before the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh
conflict, Turkey armed Azerbaijan to the teeth while Russia backed
Armenia. [In Syria, Russia continues to back the country's president
Bashar Assad while Turkey supports an umbrella collective of opposition
groups.]{.underline}

[Ankara's]{.underline} jaundiced [policy towards Russia continues during
the Ukraine crisis]{.underline}. Turkey supplies the famed Bayraktar
drones to Ukraine and limited Russia's military use of the Bosphorus
straits which connect the Black Sea with the Sea of Marmara and then
onto the Mediterranean, in accordance with the 1936 Montreux Convention.
However, **[Turkey also placates Moscow by refusing to close its
airspace to Russia (]{.underline}**unless flights are headed to Syria[)
or to impose sanctions,]{.underline} [and]{.underline} instead [has
sought]{.underline} (with little success) **[to facilitate talks between
the two sides.]{.underline}**

So, [now that Turkey has opened the path for NATO's Nordic
expansion,]{.underline} **[expect Ankara to make some sort of
conciliatory gesture to Moscow in return]{.underline}**. That is, unless
the West performs a complete U-turn in its relations with Turkey -- or,
rather, a complete appeasement.

[In getting Turkey to agree to drop its opposition to Sweden and Finland
joining NATO, the three countries signed a trilateral
memorandum]{.underline}, whereby Stockholm and Oslo pledged to drop arms
embargoes on Turkey, curtails the activities of the PKK in their soil,
examine Turkish extradition requests against suspected members of the
PKK and the Gulen movement, and promise not to provide support to
YPG/PYD in Syria.

In agreeing to these terms, it was not Turkey which made a U-turn but
rather Sweden and Finland. This new trilateral memorandum is uncannily
similar to the conditions Ankara set out for NATO expansion back in May.
No wonder the slavish Turkish press has hailed this week's deal as a
sweeping victory.

Mr Erdogan will now expect Sweden and Finland to adhere to the spirit,
and not just the (notably vague) letter, of the agreement. [This means
he will demand they back a future Turkish operation in Syria to combat
the YPG, who happen to be the West's main allies against Islamic State,
support Ankara's plans to expel and forcibly resettle over one million
Syrian refugees in northern Syria, take concrete steps to extradite
alleged members of the PKK and Gulen movement to face trial, unlikely to
be fair, in Turkey, and keep schtum about Turkey's poor human rights
records and abuses of fundamental democratic freedoms.]{.underline}

### Squo Solves -- Generic 

#### Status Quo solves emerging tech- funding, DIANA, and strategic concept

John **Harper** 6-30-20**22**"New \$1B NATO innovation will fund back
wide range of emerging Tech", FedScoop,
https://www.fedscoop.com/new-1-billion-nato-innovation-fund-will-back-wide-range-of-emerging-technology///cpd

[NATO leaders]{.underline} on Thursday officially [launched a \$1
billion innovation fund that will invest in companies working on a slew
of dual-use technologies with great military potential.]{.underline}

Billed as the world's first "multi-sovereign" venture capital fund
involving 22 nations, [it is intended to make long-term investments in
startups and other entities developing emerging technologies that the
alliance is interested in including **artificial
intelligence**]{.underline}, autonomy, big-data processing,
quantum-enabled technologies, **[biotechnology and human
enhancement]{.underline}**; novel materials; energy; [**propulsion and
space**.]{.underline}

"[This fund is unique,]{.underline}" NATO Secretary General Jens
Stoltenberg said during a signing ceremony at a summit in Madrid where
**[alliance leaders inked a letter of commitment pledging to support the
initiative.]{.underline}** "With a 15-year timeframe, the NATO
Innovation Fund will help bring to life those nascent technologies that
have [the power to transform our security in the decades to come,
strengthening the Alliance's innovation ecosystem and
bolstering]{.underline} the [security]{.underline} of our one billion
citizens."

The summit was attended by President Biden, his alliance counterparts
and other world leaders.

Together with the new Defense Innovation Accelerator for the North
Atlantic (DIANA), [the fund will help the alliance "harness the best new
technology for transatlantic security,"]{.underline} Stoltenberg said at
a press conference Wednesday. [The DIANA initiative will provide
innovators access to facilities that they can tap into, including more
than 60 test centers across Europe and North America.]{.underline}

[**DIANA** "will **support NATO's efforts to boost interoperability**
and ensure that every Ally has access to cutting-edge technological
solutions for military needs," according]{.underline} to a White House
fact sheet released Wednesday.

[The United States will contribute to that initiative by facilitating
access to U.S. test centers and other technology "accelerator sites" in
the "extensive and diverse U.S. innovation sector," according to the
White House.]{.underline}

During the summit, **[NATO also unveiled a new Strategic Concept that
emphasized the need to adopt emerging technologies to improve the
alliance's defense capabilities.]{.underline}**

Spain, on Wednesday.

**[A new cyber cooperation action plan is]{.underline}** also
**[expected]{.underline}** from this summit, [covering political,
military and technical levels.]{.underline}

\"[Since February]{.underline} 2022, [DoD deployed]{.underline} or
extended over 20,000 additional forces to Europe in response to the
Ukraine crisis, adding additional **[air, land, maritime, cyber and
space capabilitie]{.underline}**s, bringing our current total to more
than 100,000 service members across Europe,\" said the department in a
release.

**[The organization will launch the NATO Innovation Fund]{.underline}**.
"[It will invest 1 billion euros in]{.underline} start-ups and funds
[developing]{.underline} dual-use emerging [technologies]{.underline},
**[such as artificial intelligence]{.underline}**," said Jens
Stoltenberg, NATO's secretary general.

[This fund will be a part of NATO's]{.underline} Defense Innovation
Accelerator for the North Atlantic, or **[DIANA]{.underline}**,
Stoltenberg said in a press conference.

"[Leaders will offer pledges to help stand up a new Defense Innovation
Accelerator for the North Atlantic,"]{.underline} the White House said
in a release, and specified that the U[.S. will also facilitate access
to test centers and accelerator sites to NATO allies]{.underline}.

In terms of other combat resources, the increases will bring from four
to six the number of U.S. destroyers at the Rota Naval Base, in Spain.
The Army will establish a permanent headquarters for the U.S. 5th Army
Corps in Poland and a rotational brigade combat team in Romania.

\"[In Poland]{.underline}, we\'re going to [establish a permanent
headquarters]{.underline} of the U.S. 5th Army Corps **[and strengthen
NATO interoperability]{.underline}** across the entire eastern flank,\"
Biden told journalists.

Also, [the United Kingdom will receive two additional F-35]{.underline}
squadrons that will be stationed at RAF Lakenheath.

[Special operations forces will also be deployed in the Baltic
republics, as well as 625 military personnel for air defense, logistics
and engineering in Germany, as well as 65 troops to increase air defense
capabilities in Italy.]{.underline}

These decisions \"are reflective of the [United States]{.underline}
government\'s [recognition that the security environment has changed
and]{.underline}, in particular, in the [NATO]{.underline} that the
Eastern countries **[are facing a heightened threat from a Russian
leadership]{.underline}** that has shown itself willing and capable of
launching military attacks on bordering countries,\" said Celeste A.
Wallander, the Defense Department\'s assistant secretary for
international security affairs.

### Bronze Night Neg -- Solvency Answers

#### Building stacks through cooperating with NATO allows for open sourcing that provides better public benefits. 

**New America**, **ND**, \"The Digital Government Mapping Project,\"
https://www.newamerica.org/digital-impact-governance-initiative/reports/digital-government-mapping-project/10-principles-for-building-a-digital-government-stack/

1\. Modularity

[While a **handful of countries have built impressive, tightly
integrated digital stacks**,]{.underline} these outliers are the
exception rather than the rule. Both technically and politically, it is
usually easier and less expensive to create smaller solutions that can
be easily reconfigured and optimized as circumstances change. Just like
a set of Legos, modular platforms can be reassembled to address needs
and opportunities that may not have been anticipated when they were
first created. [UK Notify demonstrates these benefits. After the
solution was initially deployed in the UK, it was adapted to meet new
challenges by the Australian Digital Transformation Agency, the **U.S.
Department of Veteran Affairs**, and the Canadian Digital
Service.]{.underline} Along the way, the system developed new
capabilities. For example, [Canadian engineers added French language
support to the original tool.]{.underline} Doing so not only fulfilled a
national mandate to make the software available in French and English,
but also [provided new functionality that the UK and French-speaking
communities might be able to draw on in the future. The flexibility of
modular solutions is a huge advantage at a time when technology and
public needs are both evolving rapidly.]{.underline}

**[2. Open Source]{.underline}**

[Most of the work performed by governments is similar regardless of
whether it is in New York, New Delhi, or Freetown. Almost all
governments have to provide public benefits and services, collect taxes,
maintain registries, and carry out a pretty well-defined set of other
responsibilities that could be streamlined using
technology]{.underline}. As the example above illustrates, [governments
are slowly waking up to the opportunity to develop and share **open
source solutions** to power the public sector rather than building
duplicative solutions of varying quality]{.underline}. Along with
modular design, [**open source development can help governments
cooperate to develop best-in-class solutions, adapt them to meet their
own needs, and quickly scale them across borders to benefit other
communities at minimal extra cost.** One of the benefits of open source
development is that it allows civil society **to examine the systems
governments implement and point out design flaws, security risks, and
threats to privacy and civil rights**.]{.underline} A contact tracing
app deployed in India was found to have numerous security bugs and led
public authorities to open source the code for additional review by the
global security community. Since then, hundreds of security flaws have
been identified and fixed thanks to the power of crowdsourced
engineering talent made possible by open source. [DIGI's Building and
Reusing Open Source Tools in Government report provides a guide for how
open source solutions can foster innovation in the public
sector.]{.underline}

#### The aff's digital transformation into governable stacks will not succeed without engaging with the state to draw political will and enact new policies for technology. 

**Wilson 21** \[Kate Wilson, 2021, \"25. Digital ecosystems components
every country needs,\" Digital Impact Alliance,
https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/ee3cfcd9-en/index.html?itemId=/content/component/ee3cfcd9-en\]

[Digital transformations are multifaceted. To help countries,
development actors and other stakeholders should meet needs and
priorities that are right for each specific context.]{.underline}
Patterns across some of the countries that have led the way in digital
transformation, and measurements of national digital transformations1
themselves, suggest **that [at least five factors are
critical]{.underline}**, though not all may be initially present. [The
Digital Impact Alliance (DIAL) has developed a simple 5 Ps
framework]{.underline} (Box 25.1). Considering these interrelated areas
-- [each important to building the right digital system]{.underline} --
can help actors identify and co-ordinate around manageable problem sets.
First is political will from national leadership to achieve a digital
economy and (when relevant) an international development community to
support such a digital transformation. The second factor is
citizen-responsive policies that ensure that the system being built is
designed with citizen protection in mind. The third and fourth -- supply
and demand -- factors are commercially attractive pricing and
procurement models and the availability of scalable products that can
seamlessly connect. Finally, a fifth factor is the depth of digital
literacy and capacity among all people, including in development
agencies, to implement the policies, manage both the procurements and
products, and ultimately build sustainable solutions that can be
improved over time. Figure 25.1 elaborates the relationships among these
factors, illustrating the critical role played by political will in
driving change across the entire process.

[Box 25.1. The 5 Ps: A framework to design, implement and assess
**digital transformation**]{.underline}

[In analysis by the **Digital Impact Alliance** and others of digital
transformations **undertaken by countries** that have led the way in
this multifaceted process, five **main success factors** emerge and are
**consistently** included in available measurements of digital
transformation globally]{.underline} (DIAL, 2018\[2\]; DIAL, 2021\[3\]).
[The 5 Ps framework can help development agencies, **national
governments**, the private sector and other civil society actors better
understand the challenge in each context and where they might fit in,
and in this way find more easily manageable and co-ordinated ways
forward.]{.underline}

[**Political will**: Politics can influence a country's ability to
undertake and sustain digital transformation, and the extent to which
political actors **prioritise** the process will shape the conception,
design, use and purpose of a system.]{.underline}

**[Policy:]{.underline}** Political will is closely related to policy
[at national and global levels.]{.underline} The right policy [helps
build **trust in digital systems** by regulating the use of technology,
protecting citizen data, **minimising risks** and enabling
opportunities.]{.underline}

Pricing and procurement: Innovative financing and procurement approaches
can derisk markets to incentivise new entrants to supply digital
technology products and accelerate digital transformation.

[**Product:** The right products that are scalable, available and able
to seamlessly connect are the technology building blocks of successful
systems]{.underline}.

People: Both countries and the development partners supporting their
digital transformations need people with the right skills in areas that
enable digital services.

#### Lack of change in governmental policies leads to cooption of their stacks -- personal data leaks, abuse of personal data, lack of interoperability, and more. 

**Wilson 21** \[Kate Wilson, 2021, \"25. Digital ecosystems components
every country needs,\" Digital Impact Alliance,
https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/ee3cfcd9-en/index.html?itemId=/content/component/ee3cfcd9-en\]

Given the many factors that make up digital transformation, [**political
will** for inclusive, **people-centred** approaches at **national** and
global levels is **crucial**]{.underline}. [Without it, solutions **risk
harming** rather than helping well-being, though, for instance,
**personal data leaks, lack of interoperability, redundant systems and
abuse of personal data** in government hands]{.underline}. As the world
addresses the multiple challenges of climate change, conflict and
fragility, and the impact of COVID-19, digital and data systems can be
leveraged to maximise scarce resources and bolster preparedness for
future crises, but only if the harmful pitfalls can be avoided. [This is
the role of policy.]{.underline}

Policy should be transparent, inspire trust and minimise potential harms
of technology

[Responsible, inclusive and effective national digital transformation
requires a whole-of-society approach to developing the enabling policy
environment (]{.underline}DIAL, 2020\[1\]). Such approaches incorporate
the values of inclusion[, **obliging governments** to create meaningful
mechanisms for societal actors to participate and engage in priority
setting, stakeholder selection, implementation strategy and **holding**
their **governments accountable**]{.underline}. [Building **civic
ownership** of digital transformation, in turn, builds **citizens'
trust** in their government's use of digital tools and data. An example
of this approach is **Estonia**]{.underline} (see Chapter 12), [which
has established **mutual transparency** as a hallmark of its digital
system, with citizen input and consent as key design principles.5
National digital policy frameworks cover issues including **data
protection and privacy**, cybercrime and cybersecurity, intellectual
property rights, payments and trade regulations, digital social
protection, and emerging tech and innovation regulations]{.underline}.
[These policies acknowledge and help **guard against more insidious
economic and social impacts of digital service provision such as the use
of artificial intelligence to target or limit financial assistance or
healthcare offerings to citizens**]{.underline}. Estonia's inclusive
approach offers a useful model for other countries to consider when
designing national digital transformations.

### SSA Neg -- TCBMS Fail 

#### TCBMs fail\-\--[circumvention]{.underline} and [abuse]{.underline}

<https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2801702>

Moreover, [TCBMs]{.underline} are merely a means for achieving space
security but their [effectiveness highly depends upon their precise
contents, pertinent scope, uniform and effective implementation,
objective compliance monitoring and verification, and the presence of
efficient dispute settlement mechanisms]{.underline}. **[[Compliance
with]{.underline}]{.mark}** non-binding undertakings under **[[TCBMs
cannot be fully expected or guaranteed]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [It is
well-known that [neither the **information sharing regime**]{.mark}
under the]{.underline} non-binding [2002 Hague Code of
Conduct]{.underline} for Ballistic Missiles [nor the registration of
space objects under the]{.underline} binding [1969 Registration
Convention are fully respected by the subscribing States.]{.underline}
We should also be aware that [**[there is always a possibility of an
abuse of TCBMs]{.mark}**, as for example there have been instances when
'violations' of the Missile Technology Control Regime---a form of
TCBM---had been alleged against some States that were not subscribers to
the Regime.]{.underline} Irrespective of the good intentions and the
abundance of possible means for preventing an arms race in outer space,
[the [lack of political will]{.mark}, primarily on the part of major
space-faring nations, [has]{.mark} so far [constrained any **serious
progress in achieving space security**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Only time
will tell if the recent initiatives being undertaken by the
international community on TCBMs in outer space will bear any fruit.

#### TCBMs [actively justify]{.underline} dangerous activities which increases the risk of miscalc

Public and International Affairs at Princeton University, where he is
also a John Parker Compton Memorial Fellow and a Fellow in the Center
for International Security Studies., 10-6-2016, \"Overconfidence in
Confidence Building,\" Foreign Affairs,
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2016-10-06/overconfidence-confidence-building

In spite of their popularity, [such agreements do not always reduce
tensions. Hot lines between China and other nations, perhaps the most
basic form of a confidence-building measure, have a particularly poor
record]{.underline}. In addition to its dedicated line with the former
Soviet Union, [China has at one time or another established hot lines
with Japan, the United States, Vietnam, and South Korea. However, in
subsequent crises with those countries, the phone lines were reportedly
dead]{.underline}. After North Korea carried out a nuclear test earlier
this year, South Korean President Park Geun-hye reportedly tried to
reach Chinese President Xi Jinping on the countries' bilateral hot line
for an emergency consultation. Xi apparently declined to answer. [In
some of the cases, unrelated political disputes led to the complete
termination of the hot line]{.underline}. For example, China and Japan
had agreed in May 2010 to establish a hot line for managing crises.
However, after a September 2010 collision involving a Chinese fishing
boat and Japanese coast guard vessels, China, reportedly angered by the
Japanese decision to detain the Chinese captain, terminated the hot
line. Some Western experts have raised questions about whether China
would adhere to confidence-building agreements, and Japanese security
analysts have reportedly expressed concerns that while Beijing has shown
some willingness to engage with Washington on confidence-building
measures, it may be less cooperative with neighboring countries. [On top
of failing to resolve tensions, the [sloppy]{.mark} implementation of
such procedures **can make bad situations worse**]{.underline}. As the
scholar Marie-France Desjardins has written, [poorly negotiated and
implemented [c]{.mark}onfidence-[b]{.mark}uilding
[m]{.mark}easure[s]{.mark} pose several unintended risks]{.underline},
[such as inadvertently **[justify]{.mark}ing [dangerous or unwanted
activities]{.mark}**]{.underline}. One Western observer questioned the
value of having the United States and the Soviet Union notify each other
of large-scale military maneuvers, reportedly saying, "[If a suspected
adversary tells you he has a gun, even shows it to you, that does not
necessarily lessen your apprehension, much less your mistrust of his
motives for brandishing the weapon]{.underline}." [The development of
**[bilateral]{.mark}** [c]{.mark}onfidence-[b]{.mark}uilding
[m]{.mark}easures [and]{.mark} the subsequent warming of
[relations]{.mark} between state parties may [spark]{.mark} [concern
among states]{.mark} that are **[not party to the
agreement]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [And actual or perceived
**[noncompliance can]{.mark}** further **[poison relations]{.mark}**
between parties, **[hobbling future]{.mark}** efforts at
**[cooperation]{.mark}.**]{.underline} In the South China Sea and
elsewhere, China, the United States, and other parties to
confidence-building measures must ensure that they follow through on
agreements with effective implementation. [Noncompliance can occur for
several reasons. States may have differing interpretations of their
agreements.]{.underline} One of the advantages of confidence-building
measures, especially first-generation ones, is that they typically
require relatively little political or operational commitment from the
parties. Indeed, that's what makes confidence-building measures
attractive as initial steps between distrustful states. The 2014
agreements between China and the United States on military notifications
and codes of conduct are distinctive in that compliance with them is
both voluntary and confidential. [Compliance is not mandatory, and
information that is reported, pursuant to the agreement, cannot be
shared with other parties. But this tendency toward fewer requirements
can **make c**onfidence-**b**uilding **a**greement**s** overly **vague
and lead to misunderstandings or large loopholes.**]{.underline} For
example, Washington and Beijing currently disagree over whether the 2014
agreement applies to encounters in all waters or only those that both
recognize as international. [Then there is the issue of [**political
will**.]{.mark} An insufficient amount [can cause]{.mark}
confidence-building [measures to fall by the]{.mark}
[wayside]{.mark}]{.underline}. Upon concluding an agreement, leaders
often delegate their subordinates with the onerous task of implementing
the agreement. Such decentralization may lead to clashes between
domestic actors and a state government that struggles to build cohesive
policies. Despite Xi's efforts to consolidate his power, his policy on
the South China Sea is fragmented by domestic interest groups such as
the State Oceanic Administration, commercial fishing operations, and the
competing interests of local governments. These actors often drive
Chinese policy in contradictory directions. For example, the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs is a key coordinator for China's policy in the South
China Sea and has reportedly advocated a less confrontational approach.
[However, its efforts to form a unified and consistent policy front have
been hampered by a lack of **political authority**, given that other
bureaucratic actors, such as the People's Liberation Army or provincial
governors, enjoy political standing equal to or above that of the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs. States may also lack the institutional
capacity to implement the agreements. Few countries can match the depth
and quality of the U.S. national security apparatus. Even China has
struggled to muster comparable bureaucratic might.]{.underline} [A
former director-general of China's Department of Arms Control in the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs was reported lamenting that his office had
"less than 30 staff members, most of whom are very young and have little
practical experience in arms control."]{.underline}

avoid placing their satellites into orbits of known debris. The large
debris are most dangerous; thus, the ability to \[\*482\] track them is
very important. Nevertheless, all the hundreds of thousands of smaller
debris are also threatening. [**[Tracking is an important tool]{.mark}**
for avoiding collisions in outer space, **[but it does not solve the

Surveillance Network (SSN) tracks 23,000 debris larger than ten

4\. Spacecraft operator SSA challenges

[Many of [today\'s]{.mark} LEO and GEO [operators **are already
challenged to address all possible conjunctions**]{.mark} against the 4%
of currently tracked space objects larger than 1 cm, [**with little or
no "surge capacity**"]{.mark} (propellant and staffing resources) **[to
address]{.mark} the other [96%]{.mark}**. [If **operators** were to have
a truly comprehensive set of conjunctions]{.mark} against all objects
larger than 1 cm, [they **would**]{.mark} **likely [be continuously
conducting avoidance maneuvers]{.mark}** [at the **risk of running out
of fuel**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Inconsistencies in operator ephemerides
have also been shown to preclude achieving SSA that can support
assessments of collision probabilities higher than 1 × 10−4(a common
collision probability threshold for commercial operations). [Further,
commercial operators can be constrained by their orbit determination
programs,]{.underline} which often prevent the extraction of covariance
data and planned maneuvers to support collision probability assessment.
[**[Spacecraft operators]{.mark}** in all regimes [often **struggle to
determine** which **conjunctions are "too close."**]{.mark}]{.underline}
As shown inFig. 1, spacecraft op-erators frequently face multiple levels
of risk. Operators with spacecraftoperating in a low-risk orbital regime
can implement ultra-conservativecollision avoidance strategies at little
fuel or operations cost. Operatorswith spacecraft operating in high-risk
regimes must be as realistic andlean in their collision avoidance
strategies as possible to avoid depletingtheir fuel budget and
overtaxing theirflight dynamics teams. Unfortunately, while many
collision avoidance maneuver Go/No-Go criteria exist, operators are
generally unable to obtain the metrics and data types necessary to
populate the criteria that suit them best. Additionally, the
[[algorithms]{.underline}]{.mark} used to populate these criteria
sometimes **[[contain invalid assumptions]{.underline}]{.mark}** [such
as using linearized collision probability and spherical object shape
approximations when more sophisticated formulations are

### Bronze Night 2AC -- Stacktivism

#### Stacktivism improves the theory of The Stack. By integrating social dimensions, we intervene on the level of the political. 

**Lovink 20** -- Geert Lovink is the founding director of the Institute
of Network Cultures, whose goals are to explore, document and feed the
potential for socio-economical change of the new media field through
events, publications and open dialogue (Geert, 2020-11-09, "Principles
of Stacktivism", tripleC)

Benjamin Bratton also invites us to think tech in relation to
geo-politics and location. At the same time [**The Stack** can be seen
as method, a mechanism. However, the book is consciously **vague** about
how **material infrastructure and ideology relate**]{.underline}. [In
the light of]{.underline} Trump, [**Putin and Xi Jinping**, Bratton's
global engineer seems a tragic, retrograde figure]{.underline}. [At best
The Stack works well as a multi-disciplinary guideline of past globalist
techno-social practices that, ironically, have become **outdated** since
2016, the year of its publication and the year of Brexit and Trump. For
all its ambition to delineate the geo-political contours of
techno-operations supposedly occurring on a planetary scale, the book
settles with an oddly **depoliticised aesthetic
imaginary**.]{.underline} How can we free up The Stack from its current
confinements and turn into an improvised dance? [Let's define a
**stacktivism**, an active and reflective reading of stackson-the-move,
that is not afraid of the subject (formerly known as user) and
**involves action**, committed by confused, selfish, messy
players]{.underline}. With this I mean [**grassroots interventions**
that do not take the current (Internet or IT infrastructure) stack as a
given and turn the Will to Totality of the engineering class and their
financial backers against itself.]{.underline} In comparison with the
hacktivism and (tactical) media activism, stacktivism is indeed Hegelian
in scope (Understanding Totality). It is confronting "das Ganze" and can
be considered counter regressive as it takes into account the
real-existing totality of today's interrelated tech-architectures as
opposed to the shrinking paranoid world of the online self that is in
constant danger of collapse under the weight of its own selfimage,
surveillance, precarity and depression. Niels ten Oever, Amsterdam-based
Internet governance researcher and activist emphasises the importance of
linking contexts and levels: "[**The stack never was and never will
be**. The stack always was an **abstraction**, a story that was told to
keep people working in an isolated manner, ensuring engineers stuck to
their own layer]{.underline}. [As long as you worked within your own
parameters and delivered what the layer above and below you expected of
you, you would not get into trouble. **Stacktivism**, on the other hand,
**works across the stack**: it is a cross-stack collaboration, an
attempt to realign and redesign the interfaces. Looking for
**interconnections** and associations that cannot be drawn from above,
that defy standardization. Interconnections that escape abstractions and
stereotypes. They are established through dynamic and unpredictable
handshakes: questions, answers, and re(-)cognition"]{.underline} 13.

[Stacktivism is ambivalent and **struggles with totality**, the **global
scale** and the planetary]{.underline} whatever. Think big, but act in
small steps, that's the motto. We Are Infrastructure. [Stacktivism
**fights** against the **comfort of ignorance** and tries hard to
overcome the designed lure to drift off, hovering above it all in a
subconscious fashion. While defining what stackitivism could become, it
is good to keep mind that we're free to use Bratton's **The Stack as a
theory toolbox** and not interpret it as a hermetic belief
system.]{.underline} Designs can intermingle. In line with Bratton,
[stackivism claims to understand and oversee all levels, from the
**politics of code**, **algorithms** and **AI** to the behavioural
science manipulation of moods, interface design choices and is alert to
5G electronic smog, phishing emails, **fake news**]{.underline} and the
other sleazy suggestions of your "friends". How about your bot
sensibility? This hyperawareness comes at a high price. Not everyone is
a stacktivist. Traditionally, direct action has been put in opposition
to the talk fest. [When we act, we stop talking and start doing. In the
context of hacktivism this means that we **no longer consume** but start
to **code** in order to be able to hack into computer systems in order
to make real, **tangible changes** in society.]{.underline} Like Robin
Hood, let's define what stackivism-for-good could look like. How do we
build rhizomatic links between global governance, protocol design, the
ethics-without-consequences industry, code writing and investigative
hacking? Who will be in charge of subversive foresight? Can we dream
aloud together? How can delegate trust to our think tanks that work in
the public interest? [Stacktivism is a sovereign attitude in that it is
not begging for a correct form of representation and could be considered
**post-democratic** and **post-identity**, yet remains always
all-too-human.]{.underline} [Inside Douglas Rushkoff's Team Human
stacktivists take up the task of creating missing links: they are the
meme sharers, idea **connectors**, intercultural fellow travellers,
poly-disciplinary networkers. The **social creation** of new protocols
remains an act of **common decision.** **We are fighting at the
conceptual forefront of tech. Nobody needs to give us
permission**.]{.underline} Unlike the tactical media interventions of
the 1990s, [stacktivism is -- by definition-- abstract and conceptual in
nature, knowing that **code is power and power is code**.]{.underline}
How to dismantle invisible power? Do we fight abstractions with
abstractions, design with counter-designs? According to Internet and
civil society researcher Corinne Cath [we could see stacktivism as a
"playful **human evolution** of Bratton's concept of The Stack. It
**critiques** its modular conception of world into discrete layers. To
remedy this flattening, it calls for the inclusion of the inherent
messiness of the Internet: the entangled basement wires, packets lost in
translation, rugged governance cultures and the idiosyncratic usages of
the humans who rely on it to function flawlessly"]{.underline} 14.
Francesca Musiani (CNRS, Paris) found the lessons of decentralisation
telling: "[**Decentralization** often becomes a technical, political,
economic and social aim in and of itself]{.underline}, reaching outside
the 'hacker' circles of the early p2p systems. However, [this has had
side effects. Decentralization has become an **objective in and of
itself**, with **little understanding** of intent or assessment of
**actual effects**.]{.underline} I love Phil Agre\'s 2003 observation in
this respect when he said: '[Architecture is politics, but **should not
be understood as a substitute for politics'**]{.underline}.
Decentralized protocols are too readily assumed, because of their
technical qualities, to bring about decentralized political, social and
economic outcomes. [A more fine-tuned appreciation of the **social
dimensions of the stack** is likely to **improve** things in this
regard]{.underline}" 15.

#### Our stacktivism is distinct from "the Stack" that the neg critiques -- we create a digital commons that integrates society into our activism. 

**Lovink 20** -- Geert Lovink is the founding director of the Institute
of Network Cultures, whose goals are to explore, document and feed the
potential for socio-economical change of the new media field through
events, publications and open dialogue (Geert, 2020-11-09, "Principles
of Stacktivism", tripleC)

[Media historicism]{.underline} (aka archaeology) has so far [failed to
develop critical concepts to understand the current situation, also
known as platform capitalism.]{.underline} [There is more to the
Internet than the politics of the senses.]{.underline} Notation systems
and perception are so 20th century. [What matters now is **who owns the
Internet** in terms of data centres, cables and PR; and this is first
and foremost a **question of material analysis**]{.underline}. A
comparison with the Roman road system, as described in Innis's Empire
and Communications is more relevant here16. Let's, for instance,
investigate the relation between the modernist stack and the fuzzy
post-modern cloud buzzword. [How does Bratton's design relate to recent
proposals by stacktivists Francesca Bria and Evgeny Morozov for a
European move towards "data sovereignty"? It's too easy to unmask
Bratton as a Californian techno-solutionist.]{.underline} How much is
gained by planting this (now effectively empty) label on him? To
determine, [**to think technologically remains an utmost urgency** and
it is precisely the **"stacking"** of issues, factors and contexts that
will **bring us further** into the **constitutive force** of **technical
systems**.]{.underline} The spectacle of clashing characters should not
distract us (in fact, the silo phantom, the silence and separation is,
oddly, our main problem, in this hyperconnected world). How does
self-determination, for instance on a local level, relate to a visible
decline in the consensus about the necessity to have global standards
and global infrastructures? Is a fear of the Internet's Balkaniation
justified? [Right now, open architecture is the one principle that is in
most danger. Open standards and protectionism do not go
together.]{.underline} What would it mean if we gave up the planetary
level and narrowed our collective imaginary to the geo-politics of
competing regional empires? In a regulatory wave, [platforms can be
forced to fork, and, as a result of this, **other layers** of The
**Stack** can be **dragged with them.**]{.underline} Many apps are
already implicitly regional. Take the AngloSaxon bias of Google Books
and contrast this to the (Siberian) multipolar Libgen library. [The
liberal consensus of some kind of harmonious multi-stakeholder
**alliance between "global civil society" and tech giants** of "**global
governance** as running code" has long **lost** any
**credibility**.]{.underline} We're not only talking here about China's
Great Firewall but also latest efforts in Russia, Turkey and Iran (not
to mention USA's exceptionalism, which was one of the many causes of
this development). Does the one stack exist or should we rather speak of
The Stacks, a rainbow of a thousand stacks, such as Tiziana Terranova's
"red stack"17, the ancient blue stack of IBM and the green stack
proposal that wants to tackle the massive energy use of the blockchain
and data centres, including our own devices. And how about the European
stack? In the aftermath of Snowden, the slogan "The Internet is Broken"
started circulating, followed by Tim Berners Lee's proposals for an
alternative architecture of the web, following the Cambridge
Analytica/Facebook scandals of 2018/19.

[What Bratton's definition of **The Stack lacks** is the **society
layer**.]{.underline} We can only guess that his traditional US
"globalist" upbringing is the cause of this mishap. A Thatcherite
neo-liberal position perhaps lurks within his framework. Or should we
rather think of an anarchist disgust with the state? The enlightened
digital artist-engineer as Jesuit class? There is, for sure, more to say
about this[. **Infrastructure does not equal society**.]{.underline} A
contemporary techno-Maoist slogan could be: There is no society, only
infrastructure. There is no place either for the user as a civilian
actor. What do we draw from this? [As long as key layers are missing in
such analyses, we **can't** really **draw new relations** between them.
After all, nothing only connects with nothing. This is why some in the
context of art and hacktivism have proposed **redesigning Bratton's
scheme as a "public stack**"]{.underline}18. [We need to define **new
forms** of **collective action** that some call the **commons** that is
defined by the **ability to act together**.]{.underline} [The design
question here is what comes next after the model of social networks,
which has been so compromised and overshadowed by the social media
monopolies.]{.underline} [This is a **digital commons** in which
**collective forms of money** is included, a **redistribution of
wealth** that has been produced together and should never again be
allowed to be expropriated. We need to **collectivise** our
**knowledge** and learn from the mistakes that were made in projects
such as Wikipedia and Creative Commons, but also of the **self-centric
notion of free software** as promoted by Richard Stallman, who could
only think in terms of individual freedom of the
singleuser-as-programmer]{.underline} -- until his 2019 downfall. [What
Bratton's static metaphysical view in particular **lacks** is the **role
of actors** (and their interests, ideologies). Instead of trashing the
stack, the proposition here is to make the model more dynamic (or
dialectical) by introducing stackivism.]{.underline} [**Let's define
stacktivism as a form of Internet activism that no longer bothers with
the distractive noise on social media channels** and dares to dig deeper
in order to make a real difference.]{.underline} Instead of talking only
about upload filters, fake news or the deployment of cheap online
moderation armies, [we are working on **a next Internet.**]{.underline}
The charm of protocoldriven direct action or stacktivism is that it goes
both up (from network to platform to stack) and down (protocols, data
centres, cables), at the same time. The Internet is more than social
media, more than you and your app. This may sound like a simple,
self-evident slogan but the integral practice-based vision of
stacktivism is a promising one, beyond techno-solutionism and it
critics, the liberal-tech engineering status quo procedures, the
discontent offline romanticism, liberal privacy concerns, legalistic NGO
approaches and the after-the-fact Academic Truth that confines itself to
the closed monads of peer-review journals.
