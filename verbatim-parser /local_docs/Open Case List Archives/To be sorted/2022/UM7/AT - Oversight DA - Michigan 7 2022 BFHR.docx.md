The type of security cooperation that DoD deploys depends on the
objective at hand and capabilities of the partner nation. DoD tends to
deploy building partner capacity programs and security force assistance
to less developed partner nations in an effort to improve their tactical
and operational capabilities, while defense institution building
initiatives are used in similar contexts to strengthen ministries of
defense at the strategic level. On the other hand, programs aimed at
interoperability tend to be targeted at more-developed allies. [DoD

so]{.underline}.

[Even]{.underline} with the War Powers Act written into law, [the
president and Congress have been at odd]{.underline}s in regards to the
proper division of war powers post-1973. U.S. presidents have
consistently said that the War Powers Act is an unconstitutional
infringement on the executive branch's powers. [President Reagan used
the military without congressional authorization in Grenada. President
George H.W. Bush did get authorization for the first Gulf War but
asserted that he did not need permission from Congress to go to
war]{.underline}. The use of military force over the decades has cost
Americans and humanity at large millions of lives and trillions of
dollars. [Constitutional scholars have argued that Bush's 1989 invasion
of Panama did not comply with the requirements under the War Powers
Act]{.underline} and was not authorized by Congress, in accordance with
Article I of the Constitution. Similarly, in 1998 President Clinton sent
troops to Kosovo to conduct an extensive air campaign without
Congressional authorization. [One week after the attacks on September
11, 2001, Congress passed an Authorization for the Use of Military Force
(AUMF) against the "nations, organizations, or persons" who planned,
aided, or committed the attacks, as well as anyone who harbored those
nations, organizations or persons. This law paved the way for President
George W. Bush and the three subsequent presidents to send U.S. forces
not only to Afghanistan but also to Pakistan, Somalia, Syria, Yemen, and
other nations as part of the War on Terror.]{.underline} After more than
two decades, the terror threats to the United States and its allies look
very different from those at the time of the attacks on September 11.
According to the Department of Homeland Security, the vast majority of
attempted terrorist attacks since 2011 have emanated from domestic
groups rather than foreign ones. [The 2001 AUMF has been used as grounds
for the use of military force against groups like the Islamic State of
Iraq and Syria (ISIS), Al Qaeda, and Al Shabaab, despite the fact that
these groups were formed many years after the attacks on September
11]{.underline}. Many in Congress now support a sunset of the 2001 "War
on Terror" AUMF and a repeal of the 2002 AUMF that authorized the war in
Iraq. But while expressing the desire to repeal and replace these laws
and end endless wars, the Biden administration has not articulated a
coherent strategy that would actually do so. [The use of military force
--both authorized and unauthorized -- over the decades has cost
Americans and humanity at large millions of lives and trillions of
dollars]{.underline}. It has also contributed to the destabilization of
multiple countries, an expanding refugee crisis, accelerating climate
devastation, and the rise of new terror groups, all of which have made
the United States and people around the globe less secure.

PARADISE LOST

[Evidence of the decline in civilian control over the military **isn't
hard** to find]{.underline}. Over the last few decades, senior [military
leaders]{.underline} have [regularly **thwart**]{.underline}ed [or
**delay**]{.underline}ed [presidential decisions]{.underline} on
military policy. In 1993, Colin Powell, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, helped block President Bill Clinton from ending the policy
that banned gays from the military, resulting in the now defunct "don't
ask, don't tell" compromise. Both President Barack [**Obama** and
**Trump** complained]{.underline} that [officers **boxed them
in**]{.underline}---[limiting military options]{.underline} and leaking
information---[and forced them to]{.underline} grudgingly [accept
**troop surges**]{.underline} they did not support. Obama's generals
signaled that they would accept nothing less than an aggressive
counterinsurgency in Afghanistan---despite White House opposition. Obama
later fired Stanley McChrystal, then commander of U.S. forces in
Afghanistan, after members of the general's staff disparaged White House
officials in remarks to a reporter. Trump, for his part, saw senior
[military leaders push back against]{.underline} his [orders to withdraw
troops]{.underline} from Afghanistan and Syria. Although these moves
were signature campaign promises, Trump eventually backed off when
military leaders told him they couldn't be done and that the policies
would harm national security.

Of course, senior military leaders do not always get everything they
want, but they often get more than they should. Their power also extends
beyond headline-grabbing decisions about overseas deployments or troop
reductions. [The military's influence manifests hundreds of times a day
through **bureaucratic maneuvers**]{.underline} inside the Pentagon, in
policy discussions in the White House, and during testimony on Capitol
Hill. [These mundane interactions]{.underline}, perhaps more than
anything else, [**steer decision-making** away from
civilians]{.underline} in the Office of the Secretary of Defense and
toward uniformed personnel. Inside the Pentagon, for instance, military
leaders often preempt the advice and analysis of civilian staff by
sending their proposals straight to the secretary of defense, bypassing
the byzantine clearance process that non-uniformed staffers must
navigate.

There are signs of the erosion of civilian control outside the Pentagon,
as well. [Congress]{.underline} too [**rarely demands** that the
military bow to civilian authority, instead weighing in **selectively**
and for **partisan** reasons]{.underline}. During the Obama
administration, for example, some commentators and at least one member
of Congress suggested that Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, should resign in protest over the president's
management of the campaign to defeat the Islamic State, also known as
ISIS. The goal was to use Dempsey's role as the president's chief
military adviser as leverage in a partisan battle over Obama's foreign
policy. Under Trump, many Democrats cheered on the retired and
active-duty generals who pushed back against the president's decisions.
These "adults in the room" included James Mattis (the secretary of
defense), John Kelly (the secretary of homeland security and then White
House chief of staff), and H. R. McMaster (Trump's national security
adviser). At the extreme, some of Trump's opponents even urged senior
military leaders to contemplate removing Trump from office. In August
2020, two well-known retired army officers, John Nagl and Paul Yingling,
penned an open letter to Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, telling him to do just that if the president refused to leave
office after losing the 2020 election. Although these efforts may have
comforted those concerned about Trump's erratic policies, they
undermined civilian control by suggesting that it was the military's job
to keep the executive in check. When politicians endorse military
insubordination that serves their interests, they do long-term damage to
the principle of civilian primacy.

[Oversight itself has also become **politicized**]{.underline}.
[Politicians increasingly turn to those with military experience to
**run the Pentagon**]{.underline}. Trump decided to appoint a former
general, Mattis, as secretary of defense, and [Biden]{.underline} did
the same, [put]{.underline}ting **[Lloyd Austin]{.underline}** [in the
post]{.underline}. In both cases, [Congress had to waive a requirement
that officers be retired for at least **seven years**]{.underline}
before serving in the department's top job. The rule, which had been
broken only once before, is designed to prioritize leaders with distance
from the mindset and social networks associated with military service.
Ideally, defense secretaries should be comfortable operating as
civilians---not soldiers. Mattis's and [Austin's]{.underline}
nominations, and subsequent [confirmations]{.underline}, therefore
[represent a break with over **seven decades**]{.underline} [of law and
tradition]{.underline}, beginning with the 1947 reforms, stipulating
that the secretary of defense cannot be a recently retired general.

There is no obvious reason to think that those with military experience
are better suited to controlling the military on behalf of Congress or
the president---and plenty of reasons to suspect the opposite. In the
military, soldiers are taught to follow orders, not scrutinize their
implications, as a cabinet official should. Military personnel,
moreover, are ideally taught to stay out of partisan debates, whereas
the secretary's job demands well-honed political skill and experience.
Yet as Mattis's and Austin's appointments show, military service is
becoming a litmus test for Pentagon policy jobs traditionally held by
civilians, and this is true even at lower levels.

Meanwhile, the public is failing to insist that elected leaders hold the
military to account. Many Americans would rather put troops on a
pedestal and admire the military from afar. Repeating the mantra
"Support our troops" has become a substitute for the patriotic duty of
questioning the institution those troops serve. Large numbers of
citizens are now reluctant to even offer their opinions in response to
survey questions about the military, let alone to criticize military
leaders. In a 2013 YouGov survey, for instance, 25 to 30 percent of the
nonveterans asked consistently chose "I don't know" or "no opinion" in
response to questions about the military.

At best, these trends immunize the military from scrutiny; at worst,
they give it a pass to behave with impunity. An October 2017 White House
press conference epitomized this exceptionalism: during a discussion of
Trump's condolence call to the widow of a slain soldier, Kelly, who had
served in the military for more than four decades and whose own son was
killed fighting in Afghanistan, refused to call on journalists who
didn't know someone who had had a family member killed in combat. Sarah
Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, later admonished
journalists for daring to question Kelly. Debating "a four-star Marine
general," she said, was "highly inappropriate."

ORIGIN STORY

Part of [the decline in civil-military relations can be blamed on
**institutional changes**]{.underline}. [As the United States became a
global power]{.underline}, elected leaders developed a bureaucratic
structure to manage the military on a day-to-day basis. When it became
clear at the start of the Cold War that the U.S. defense establishment
had become too large for the president and the legislature to control on
their own, Congress passed the National Security Act of 1947. The law
established what would eventually become the Department of Defense and
placed at its head a civilian secretary of defense, who would bring
experience managing bureaucratic and domestic politics. That person
would have the exclusive job of ensuring that the military's activities
aligned with the nation's goals as determined by its elected political
leaders. And Congress granted the secretary a civilian staff composed of
individuals who could draw on their experiences in government, business,
and academia.

But in 1986, Congress unintentionally undid much of this work. That
year, it overhauled the 1947 law by passing the Goldwater-Nichols
Department of Defense Reorganization Act, which shifted power and
resources away from civilian leaders and to their military counterparts.
Since that law passed, large, [**well-resourced** military staffs have
**displaced** civilians in the Pentagon and across the rest of the
government]{.underline}. Today, for example, [ambassadors and other
civilian officials frequently depend on the military's regional
combatant commands]{.underline} for resources, including planes and
logistical support, necessary to do their jobs. Regional combatant
commanders also have responsibilities that cross national boundaries,
giving them de facto diplomatic authority and frequent contact not only
with their military counterparts overseas but also with foreign
government leaders. The military officials who govern security
assistance and cooperation programs have also grown in number and
influence, further sidelining their civilian counterparts in the State
Department.

It is a truism in national security discourse that diplomats are
underfunded relative to the military. Even former defense secretaries,
including Mattis and Robert Gates, have warned Congress of the risks of
underfunding the State Department. But no one ever does much about it.
Without a serious attempt at rebalancing, the military's personnel and
resource advantages will only further undermine civilian control, giving
the military extra speed and capacity that it can leverage during
bureaucratic fights to make and implement policy.

At the same time, there has also been a hollowing out of the processes
of civilian control within the Department of Defense itself. In recent
years, the Pentagon has faced immense difficulties recruiting,
retaining, and managing the civilian professional staff responsible for
overseeing the uniformed military. These challenges are the result of
underinvestment in the civilian workplace. There is little systematic
training to prepare civilian officials for their responsibilities, and
they are often thrown into the deep end of the Pentagon and left to sink
or swim. In contrast, service members benefit from thorough professional
military education programs and other developmental opportunities
throughout their careers.

By 2018, this situation had deteriorated to a point where the bipartisan
National Defense Strategy Commission, a congressionally appointed panel,
concluded that a lack of civilian voices in national security
decision-making was "undermining the concept of civilian control." To be
sure, these problems became more acute during the Trump administration,
when the Pentagon was littered with acting officials and unfilled
positions. But the civilian bench was shallow long before Trump took
over.

PLAYING POLITICS

**[Partisan polarization]{.underline}** [has also undermined civilian
control]{.underline}. **[After 9/11]{.underline}**, the public's esteem
for the military spiked, and politicians noticed. Elected
[leaders]{.underline} became increasingly willing to [disregard
civil-military norms]{.underline}, avoid serious oversight and
accountability, and encourage military insubordination to score
political points against their political opponents.

Today, [politicians on both sides of the aisle capitalize on the
military's **prestige** to shield themselves from criticism and attack
their rivals]{.underline}---often a cost-free strategy, given the
military's popularity. During campaigns, candidates often claim that
troops prefer them over their opponent; in 2020, a Trump ad featured the
tagline "Support our troops," and Biden cited a Military Times poll to
suggest that it was he who enjoyed their support. Candidates regularly
seek the endorsement of retired generals and even use them as partisan
attack dogs. At the 2016 Republican National Convention, the Trump
adviser Michael Flynn, who had then been out of the military for just
two years, criticized Trump's opponent, Hillary Clinton, and encouraged
the crowd to chant "Lock her up!" As president, Trump repeatedly
delivered partisan speeches in front of uniformed audiences, once
telling officers at MacDill Air Force Base, "We had a wonderful
election, didn't we? And I saw those numbers---and you like me, and I
like you." In over-the-top campaign videos, some post-9/11 veterans
running for office use their experience as a means of dividing those who
served from those who did not. In 2020, the Republican Texas congressman
and former Navy SEAL Dan Crenshaw released an Avengers-themed ad
entitled "Texas Reloaded" that featured attack helicopters, fighter
jets, and Crenshaw himself parachuting out of a plane.

More frequently ignored, however, are the less egregious moments of
politicization, such as presidents donning bomber jackets and flight
suits in public speeches to military audiences or venturing to West
Point to make major foreign policy addresses rather than to a civilian
university. All these actions reinforce the belief that military service
is superior to other kinds of public service.

Even though politicians try to gain electoral advantage through such
behavior, what they are ultimately doing is damaging their own
authority. By lionizing the armed forces, politicians teach the public
to expect elected officials to make concessions to military leaders or
defer to them on important decisions. This same dynamic motivates
civilian leaders to encourage officers to serve as "the adults in the
room," resist or oppose their partisan opponents' policies, or resign in
protest against a lawful order from an elected president. Although there
may be short-term advantages to such behavior (assuming, of course, that
the military leaders are correct), it subverts the broader principle
that civilians get to pursue the policies they were elected to carry
out.

The military has also played a role in the degradation of civilian
control. For one thing, its nonpartisan ethic is in decay. Whereas the
majority of senior military officers did not identify with a political
party as late as 1976, nearly three-quarters do so today, according to
surveys of senior officers attending various war colleges conducted
between 2017 and 2020. Many service members are comfortable airing their
partisan political commentary on social media to wide audiences, an
outspokenness that would have made past generations of soldiers blush.
Retired generals involved in politics---especially through campaign
endorsements---reinforce to those in uniform that the military is riven
by partisan divides. Senior military leaders have largely failed to
address this behavior, either looking the other way or attributing it to
a few bad apples. Their silence, however, normalizes partisanship in the
military, with those in uniform concluding that it is acceptable to
openly pick political sides. Recent surveys of senior active-duty
officers found that roughly one-third had observed their colleagues make
or share disparaging comments about elected officials on social media.

Service members also make civilian control that much harder when they
act as if they are superior to their civilian counterparts. Research
consistently shows that many in the military believe that their decision
to serve in uniform makes them morally superior to those Americans who
did not make that choice. According to a 2020 survey by the research
institution NORC, this sense of superiority extends even to their views
of those Americans whose jobs also entail significant risks---including
doctors fighting the pandemic and diplomats serving in combat zones or
in hardship assignments. At the extreme, military personnel question the
legitimacy of the civilians who oversee them, especially if they suspect
that those leaders don't share their partisan views.

Another factor undermining civilian authority is the military's
attachment to the notion that it should have exclusive control over what
it views as its own affairs. This concept, endorsed by the political
scientist Samuel Huntington, contends that the military has a right to
push back when civilians attempt to interfere in military matters.
According to this view, autonomy is a right, not a privilege. But
military and political affairs are not as distinct as many officers have
been led to believe, and the experience of other countries suggests that
alternative models are just as plausible: throughout Europe, for
example, military leaders are accustomed to much more intrusive
oversight than their U.S. counterparts.

HOLLYWOOD TREATMENT

[Trends in **American culture** underpin many of these
problems]{.underline}. [Americans increasingly
**fetishize**]{.underline} [the armed forces]{.underline} and believe
that the only true patriots are those in uniform. According to Gallup
polling, [the public consistently has **more confidence**]{.underline}
[in the military than in **any other** national
institution]{.underline}. [That admiration, coupled with declining trust
and confidence in civilian organizations, means that large segments of
the population think]{.underline} that [those in uniform should
run]{.underline} the military, and maybe even [the **country
itself**]{.underline}.

This adoration has grown in part out of efforts to bring the military
out of its post-Vietnam malaise. In 1980, Edward Meyer, the army chief
of staff, declared his force a "hollow army," and that same year, an
operation intended to rescue U.S. hostages in Iran ended in disaster,
showing the public just how depleted its armed forces had become. While
Congress attempted to rectify the situation by ramping up military
spending, the military cannily worked to rehabilitate its image through
popular culture. In the 1980s, the Pentagon cooperated with big-budget
movies such as Top Gun, a practice it has continued to the present with
such superhero films as Captain Marvel. By conditioning its cooperation
and provision of equipment on approval of the script, the military
learned that it could influence storylines and enhance its brand.

Another contributing problem is the military's tendency to recruit
heavily from particular subsections of American society. With few calls
for shared sacrifice or national mobilization during the wars in
Afghanistan and Iraq, the majority of the public had little to do
besides thank the troops for their service. The military, meanwhile went
to great lengths to honor soldiers with patriotic displays centered on
the nobility of military service, notably during college and
professional sporting events. These trends all reinforced the notion
that military service members were truly exceptional---better,
different, and more selfless than the civilians who cheered them on.

Less than halfway through the year, the May 19, 2022 passage of more
than \$41 billion in emergency funding for Ukraine positions the country
to become the largest single recipient of U.S. security sector
assistance in 2022. The latest funding includes at least \$6 billion in
direct military aid to Ukraine, and billions more for Ukraine and other
European partners. Altogether, even a conservative estimate places the
value of the military assistance [Ukraine will receive in 2022 as
**equivalent** to what the U.S. provided **Afghanistan**, **Israel**,
and **Egypt** in FY2020 **combined**]{.underline}.

In the aftermath of Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea, Ukraine had
already become the most significant recipient of U.S. security
assistance in Europe, receiving \$2.7 billion in American military aid
between 2014 and 2021. But now, those totals are being quickly eclipsed
as the United States and its western allies rush billions of dollars
worth of weaponry to Kyiv.

The unprecedented sum reflects both the strategic earthquake resulting
from Russia's invasion as well as the West's evolving assessment of
Ukraine's prospects in its fight with Moscow. With such enormous
quantities of weaponry now making their way to Ukraine, it's worth
reflecting on the evolution of this extraordinary surge in international
military assistance and its consequences.

What's Been Committed to Ukraine Since the February 24, 2022 Invasion

After Russia crossed into Ukraine on February 24, 2022, the United
States massively expanded its security assistance efforts and began
making use of emergency authorities to expedite the transfer of weaponry
and equipment to the country. Since February 2022, the United States has
provided \$3.9 billion in security sector assistance to Ukraine. In
short, in less than three months between February and April 2022, the
United States provided one billion more in security assistance than it
did in the seven years between 2014 and 2021.

The United States has provided a wide range of weapons and equipment.
According to U.S. government reports, as of May 6th, United States had
committed the following:

- More than 1,400 Stinger anti-aircraft systems

- 5,500 Javelin anti-armor systems

- 14,000 other anti-armor weapon systems

- 700 Switchblade drones and an undisclosed number of Phoenix Ghost
  Tactical Drones

- 16 helicopters

- Hundreds of High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles

- 90 155mm Howitzer artillery pieces and nearly 200,000 shells

- 200 armored personnel carriers

- 7,000 small arms

- 50 million rounds of small arms ammunition

The vast quantity of weapons and equipment provided to Ukraine totals
over \$3.8 billion so far and excludes the billions in military related
assistance in the emergency supplemental passed by Congress on May 19.
The new funding package adds an additional \$6 billion for the Ukraine
Security Assistance Initiative -- the Ukraine-specific program that
funds defense acquisition for the government in Kyiv -- and an
additional \$4 billion in Foreign Military Financing for Ukraine and
other European allies. Additionally, the bill adds \$9.05 billion to
replenish U.S. weapons stockpiles depleted by a series of transfers to
Ukraine and other neighboring states. [The bill also raises the
**statutory limit** for what the President is permitted to transfer from
existing U.S. weapons stockpiles]{.underline} to \$11 billion, providing
another pool of equipment that the President can draw from.

[Arriving at an **exact total**]{.underline} [for military
aid]{.underline} committed to Ukraine in the aftermath of this bill's
passage [is]{.underline} **[challenging]{.underline}**. Much of the
assistance is being made available to Ukraine and "and countries
impacted by the situation in Ukraine." In addition, the funding for
stockpile replenishment may not represent the exact equivalent of
military hardware that has already been transferred to Kyiv.
Nevertheless, [estimates of the **aggregate value** of military aid
committed to Kyiv would likely make Ukraine the **largest yearly** U.S.
security assistance recipient of the **21st century**.]{.underline}

The Evolution of U.S. Security Assistance to Ukraine

Changes in the scale, scope, and makeup of U.S. security assistance over
the first four months of the conflict in Ukraine reflect shifting war
imperatives, political realities, and appraisals of potential conflict
outcomes.

The earliest days of the war following Russia's invasion in February
2022 were characterized by positional urban fighting and small unit
tactics. The United States, Kyiv, and other international partners were
focused on equipping forces defending key urban areas with weaponry that
could be quickly delivered and used without significant sustainment or
training need. The result was thousands of shoulder-fired anti-armor and
anti-air missiles, thousands of small arms, and millions of rounds of
small arms ammunition pouring into the country. Just over two weeks
after the beginning of the conflict, by March 16, 2022, U.S.-origin
equipment committed to Ukraine included:

- 600 Stinger anti-aircraft systems

- 2,600 Javelin anti-armor systems

- Tactical drones

- 200 shotguns

- 200 machine guns

- 40 million rounds of small arms ammunition

- 1 million grenade, mortar, and artillery rounds

While the United States did provide a handful of rotary aircraft and
armored personnel carriers, much like Ukraine's other military patrons,
Washington was acutely concerned that the provision of more advanced or
heavy weaponry could provoke an escalation from Moscow. In striking the
balance of providing weapons to help Ukraine defend itself, Washington
sought to test the limits of assistance without sparking a wider war or
a direct retaliation from the Kremlin, especially as President Putin
rattled his nuclear saber. Those sensitivities were on full display
after a surprise proposal from Poland to transfer some of its Soviet-era
fighter jets to Ukraine in exchange for new U.S. aircraft was shot down
by the Biden Administration for fear it was too direct an incitement of
Russian animosity.

Those calculations changed in late March, as stiff Ukrainian resistance
and failures in the Russian assault allowed Kyiv to withstand much of
the Kremlin's initial offensive, especially around the capital.
Incapable of managing their stretched logistics and maintaining pressure
around so many axes of advance, Russia elected to withdraw from
significant portions of the country and re-orient their war effort
toward seizing the country's east and, potentially, coastal south.

The battlefield transition also catalyzed a transition in Washington's
view of the conflict and the nature of its security assistance to
Ukraine. Strategically, it crystallized assessments that Ukraine and its
government would survive the conflict with significant territory under
its control and could potentially reclaim some areas it lost to Russia
in the conflict's initial phase. With the imminent and existential
threat relatively at bay, and with somewhat more generous time horizons,
new opportunities to consider security packages with more advanced
weaponry with longer lead times became viable.

Additionally, a battle for Ukraine's east represents a fundamentally
different operational context. Far from the positional urban fighting
that Ukraine was able to master early on, the famed Eurasian steppe
presents new advantages for Russia. Shorter supply lines, a more
concentrated frontline, and open terrain that advantages Russia's
mechanized armor and long-range heavy firepower will create significant
tactical challenges for Ukrainian defenders. As Ukraine's foreign
minister put it to a NATO gathering, "the battle for Donbas will remind
you of the Second World War with large operations, thousands of tanks,
armored vehicles, planes, artillery."

Accordingly, in this new phase of the conflict, the United States has
dramatically enhanced its security assistance to Ukraine, expanding to
newer, more advanced weapons systems that speak to the particular
battlefield realities of this new phase in the war. With battlefield
outcomes now being determined by the accuracy and range of heavy
weaponry, the U.S. has committed additional artillery, air defense
systems, advanced radar systems, more rotary aircraft, and a slew of
never before seen drones that will see some of their first combat in
Ukraine. The change reflects both the new battlefield challenges Ukraine
will face in the Donbas, but also the view from Washington that Russia's
warnings against providing additional weaponry to Kyiv are mostly
rhetorical.

In addition, the United States has expanded its assistance in
non-material but strategically significant ways. Perhaps most important
has been Washington's provision of real-time intelligence to Ukrainian
forces. Reports suggest that Ukraine has made use of the information to
target high-ranking Russian military officials and to sink Russia's
famed Black Sea flagship, the Moskva. The U.S. has also begun providing
training to Ukrainian troops on some of the new weapon systems they are
set to receive, though the training continues to take place outside of
Ukraine.

Extraordinary Authorities

Since 2014, the United States has relied on a handful of conventional
[**s**ecurity **c**ooperation]{.underline} and assistance authorities to
support Ukraine's defense and security forces, including Foreign
Military Financing, International Military Education and Training, and
the purpose-built Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative. These programs
followed typical Congressional appropriations processes and reflected a
more methodical approach to building Ukrainian security capacity.

However, [current events have changed the **traditional** assistance
model]{.underline}. In late 2021, as the U.S. intelligence community
became convinced that a Russian invasion was imminent, the United States
faced a new urgency to shore up Ukrainian defenses against the
substantially more developed military might of the Kremlin. [The Biden
Administration reached for **new** and **exceptional** tools to get
hardware to Ukrainians quickly]{.underline}.

The most prominent of those exceptional tools has been [the
**Presidential Drawdown Authority**]{.underline}, which [allows the
**Executive Branch** to **take weapons**, ammunition, and other materiel
from existing U.S. stocks and provide them to other countries **without
congressional authorization**]{.underline}. [The Biden Administration
has invoked the authority **ten times**]{.underline} [for Ukraine since
August 2021]{.underline}. [To put that in context]{.underline}, a 2016
Government Accountability Office report found that [the authority was
invoked just **11** times between 2011 and 2015]{.underline}. The
authority offers some advantages in the current context, including
reducing lead times for materiel from months or years to days and weeks.

Additionally, in March 2022, [the President invoked an emergency
authority under the **Arms Export Control Act**, which allows the
Executive Branch to **bypass** the statutorily mandated **congressional
notification** process and **proceed immediately** with an international
arms sale or export]{.underline}. The authority requires the Executive
to certify that an emergency exists that creates a national security
imperative for the immediate sale or export of defense articles or
services without the typical 15-30 pause for notification and
congressional consideration. The authority has only been invoked on a
handful of occasions, including in 2019 when President Trump
controversially used it to transfer munitions and other defense articles
to members of the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen without
congressional notification and despite strong congressional opposition.

[Congress has also passed an updated version of the World War II-era
**Lend Lease Act**, authorizing the Administration to provide military
equipment]{.underline} to Ukraine and other countries [in the region on
an **indefinite basis**]{.underline} [and without the need to come back
to Congress for **additional funding**]{.underline}. During the Second
World War, President Franklin D. Roosevelt used the statute to arm
Britain and, to a lesser degree, Russia.

In addition, with the passage of the most recent 41 billion dollar
package, [the President has]{.underline} now submitted and been
[granted]{.underline} two emergency supplemental funding requests to
Congress amounting to [more than \$**54 billion**]{.underline} [related
to Ukraine]{.underline} including at least \$32.3 billion for European
theatre defense and **[security assistance]{.underline}**.

Conclusion

The war in Ukraine has fundamentally shifted the focus of U.S. military
assistance. For the first time in the 21st century, the largest
recipient of U.S. security assistance is not in the Middle East or
Central Asia, but in Europe. The war in Ukraine has become the defining
foreign policy priority of the Biden Administration, and with a growing
consensus in Western capitals that the end to the war is nowhere in
sight, it is likely that the volume of military assistance the United
States provides to Ukraine will continue to climb.

threaten security and stability around the globe and have significant
implications for U.S. national security as well as military operations.

[The committee will conduct oversight of numerous

Maintaining U.S. Superiority in Conventional Weapon Technologies

As part of the renewed emphasis on capabilities for high-end
conventional warfare, [DOD officials have expressed concern that **U.S.
superiority** in conventional weapon technologies has
**narrowed**]{.underline} [or]{.underline} in some cases even [been
**eliminated**]{.underline} [by **China** and]{.underline} (in certain
areas) **[Russia]{.underline}**. In response, DOD has taken a number of
actions in recent years that are intended [to]{.underline} help
[maintain or **regain U.S. superiority** in conventional weapon
technologies]{.underline}, including increased research and development
funding for new militarily applicable technologies such as artificial
intelligence (AI), autonomous unmanned weapons, hypersonic weapons,
directed-energy weapons, biotechnology, and quantum technology. 68 A
February 2, 2022, press report stated:

Innovation and Speed of U.S. Weapon System Development and Deployment

In addition to the above-mentioned efforts for maintaining U.S.
superiority in conventional weapon technologies, DOD is placing new
emphasis on innovation and speed in weapon system development and
deployment, so as to more quickly and effectively transition new weapon
technologies into fielded systems. The 2018 NDS places states

> Deliver performance at the speed of relevance. Success no longer goes
> to the country that develops a new technology first, but rather to the
> one that better integrates it and adapts its way of fighting. Current
> processes are not responsive to need; the Department is overoptimized
> for exceptional performance at the expense of providing timely
> decisions, policies, and capabilities to the warfighter. Our response
> will be to prioritize speed of delivery, continuous adaptation, and
> frequent modular upgrades. We must not accept cumbersome approval
> chains, wasteful applications of resources in uncompetitive space, or
> overly risk-averse thinking that impedes change. Delivering
> performance means we will shed outdated management practices and
> structures while integrating insights from business innovation.70

The individual military services have taken various actions in recent
years to increase innovation and speed in their weapon acquisition
programs. Some of these actions make use of special acquisition
authorities provided by Congress in recent years that are intended in
part to reduce the time needed to transition new weapon technologies
into fielded systems, including Other Transaction Authority (OTA) and
what is known as Section 804 Middle Tier authority.71

On January 23, 2020, DOD released a new defense acquisition framework,
called the Adaptive Acquisition Framework, that is intended to
substantially accelerate the DOD's process for developing and fielding
new weapons.72 In previewing the new framework in October 2019, DOD
described it as "the most transformational acquisition policy change
we've seen in decades." 73

Some observers argue that [DOD is not doing enough or moving **quickly**
enough to generate and implement innovations in response to **great
power competition**]{.underline}, and have proposed steps for doing more
or moving more quickly.74 **[\<\<\<FOOTNOTE 74

deployment]{.underline}, U.S. defense acquisition policy and [the

acquisition programs [will need to be **adjusted** to place a **greater

defense acquisition policy, alongside more traditional measures of merit

testing. As a consequence, they argue, defense acquisition policy and
the [oversight]{.underline} paradigm for assessing the success of
acquisition programs [should place **more emphasis**]{.underline} [on
time as a **risk factor**]{.underline} [and feature **more
experimentation**]{.underline}, [**risk-taking**, and **tolerance of

testing potentially being viewed in some cases not as an indication of
success, but of inadequate innovation or speed of development.76

Mobilization Capabilities for Extended-Length Conflict

The renewal of [great power competition has led to an **increased
emphasis**]{.underline} [in discussions of U.S. defense on]{.underline}
U.S. mobilization [capabilities for an **extended-length**
conflict]{.underline}.77 The term mobilization is often used to refer
specifically to preparations for activating U.S. military reserve force
personnel and inducting additional people into the Armed Forces. In this
report, it is used more broadly, to refer to various activities,
including those relating to the ability of the industrial base to
support U.S. military operations in a larger-scale, extended-length
conflict against China or Russia. Under this broader definition,
mobilization capabilities include but are not limited to capabilities
for

> • inducting and training additional military personnel to expand the
> size of the force or replace personnel who are killed or wounded;
>
> • producing new weapons and supplies to replace those expended in the
> earlier stages of a conflict, and delivering those weapons and
> supplies to distantly deployed U.S. forces in a timely manner;
>
> • repairing battle damage to ships, aircraft, and vehicles;
>
> • replacing satellites or other support assets that are lost in
> combat; and
>
> • manufacturing spare parts and consumable items.

Some observers have expressed concern about the adequacy of U.S.
mobilization capabilities, particularly since this was not a major
defense-planning concern during the 20 to 25 years of the post-Cold War
era, and have recommended various actions to improve those capabilities.

[Domestic polarization not only affects the policymaking process but
also the way policies become implemented]{.underline}. Scholars of US
foreign policy have shown that over time, **[the highly contentious
forces of domestic politics in some policy areas, such as international
economics, have incentivized the president to rely more heavily on other
instruments, such as military deployments]{.underline}** and defense
procurement (Milner and Tingley 2015). Others have shown that partisan
incentives have reduced presi- dents' use of force abroad and influenced
how presidents carry out military operations (Howell and Pevehouse,
2007; Kriner 2010). Meanwhile, others have found that greater prospects
for legislative success incline the president to engage in more
high-risk military interventions and fewer humanitarian interventions
(Marshall and Prins 2016). In addition, **[studies on presidential use
of executive agreements suggest that domestic polarization inclines
presidents to advance their agenda unilaterally]{.underline}** (Caruson
and Farrar-Myers 2007; Amirfar and Singh 2018).

[Polarization also influences the effectiveness of US foreign policy
execution]{.underline}. As some scholars have argued, **[polarization
has limited the rally-around-the-flag effect in response to external
security threats]{.underline}** (Myrick 2021). In addition, political
and material costs for the execution of certain partisan foreign
policies and visions of international order have increased in times of
domestic polarization (Bafumi and Parent 2012; Kreps et al. 2018). As a
consequence of the widening gap domestically for a cohesive strategy,
[the executive branch is more incentivized to politicize US foreign
policy through wedge-issues to weaken political opposition]{.underline}
(Snyder et al. 2009). **[This, in turn, has contributed to a
polarization of US relationships with allies and partners]{.underline}**
(Drezner 2018).

undermines agency morale**

[Part of the job of any manager, in any organisational setting, is to
motivate employees]{.underline}. Doing so involves cultivating employee
work attitudes (e.g. job satisfaction, organisational commitment) and
behaviours (e.g. arriving to work on time, aiding coworkers) that are
thought to be associated with individual- and organisational-level
performance. In exercising its oversight function, however, [Congress is
not necessarily interested in doing these things]{.underline}. [Instead,
it is primarily interested in ensuring federal agencies' responsiveness
to legislative preferences]{.underline}.4 [However, in pursuing
responsiveness, Congress can unwittingly harm agency
morale]{.underline}. Before fully developing this argument below, we
define the empirical focus of our study -- agency morale -- and discuss
its importance for agency performance. [We use the term "agency morale"
to denote agency employees' collective feelings of autonomy and job
satisfaction]{.underline}. Theory and evidence from the organisational
behaviour literature suggest that, at the individual level, both of
these traits are positively related to job performance. In a
meta-analysis of 312 independent samples, Judge et al. (2001) found a
correlation between job satisfaction and job performance of 0.30.
Similarly, in a meta-analysis of 101 independent samples, [Spector
(1986) found a correlation between autonomy and job performance of 0.26.
In fact, these correlations likely underestimate the total impact of job
satisfaction and autonomy on performance, given that both are associated
with numerous other work attitudes and behaviours that are themselves
related to performance]{.underline}. These include, for instance,
organisational commitment, role conflict, role ambiguity, emotional
distress, absenteeism, turnover intention and actual turnover (Spector
1986; Mathieu and Zajac 1990; Tett and Meyer 1993; Meyer et al. 2002;
Riketta 2002). [Theories of public sector organisational effectiveness
and political control pay special attention to autonomy. The former
typically emphasises autonomy's salutary operational qualities: it
allows agencies to use their expertise to solve pressing implementation
problems, make and execute decisions quickly, and pursue their missions
in an administratively rational manner]{.underline} (see, e.g. Wilson
1989; Wolf 1993; Meier 1997; Rainey and Steinbauer 1999; Brewer and
Selden 2000). These theories also assume that autonomy has motivational
benefits at the employee level. Individuals -- particularly individuals
with high levels of formal education and professional training -- value
autonomy and work harder when it is given to them (see, e.g. Gagné and
Deci 2005). In contrast[, theories of political control tend to view
autonomy as necessary -- bureaucracies have expertise that political
actors lack, and so delegations of authority are sometimes unavoidable
-- but potentially problematic, given that bureaucracies are
nonelectoral institutions. Yet, even political theories note the
importance of autonomy for organisational performance]{.underline}.
Gailmard and Patty (2007, 2012), for example, argue that congressional
principals, who generally prefer informed to uninformed policymaking,
proactively grant autonomy and policymaking discretion to bureaucratic
agents in order to incentivise investments in expertise. Whatever their
differences, both schools tend to agree that autonomy is systematically
associated with organisational performance and the development of policy
expertise. Consequently, we believe it is important to examine whether
congressional oversight is associated with agency autonomy.
Congressional oversight and its managerial consequences [We expect that
congressional oversight will be negatively associated with autonomy and
job satisfaction when such oversight is primarily meant to monitor and
control the bureaucracy for political reasons, rather than to aid it in
the performance of agency duties]{.underline} (Weingast and Moran 1983;
Ferejohn and Shipan 1990; Shipan 2004). [Congress is often unlike the
manager or firm owner described in standard economic accounts of
principal-agent theory. In these accounts, it is usually assumed that
the principal is concerned with securing some outcome and is, moreover,
happy to let the agent choose whatever means or behaviours best serve
that end]{.underline} (for a review, see Eisenhardt 1989). [The
congressional impulse to control, however, often seeks to dictate the
bureaucracy's choice of means. This impulse is intensified in our
separation of powers system, where Congress often competes with the
president for agency influence]{.underline} (Shapiro 1994; Whitford
2005). Below, we identify three particular mechanisms through which
congressional oversight can harm agency morale and conclude by arguing
that oversight's relationship with morale is ultimately conditional on
whether it is adversarial or friendly. Mechanism I: micromanagement
[Consistent with the predilection of Congress to be interested in
control rather than performance, scholars have long noted that its
oversight relationship with the federal bureaucracy has been
characterised by micromanagement]{.underline}, or "intervention by
Congress in administrative details" (Gilmour and Halley 1994, 10). As
early as 1885, Woodrow Wilson complained that Congress "has entered more
and more into the details of the administration, until it has virtually
taken into its own hands all the substantial powers of government"
(Wilson 1896, cited in Beermann 2006). Similarly, Wilson wrote that
"Congress is commonly criticized for 'micromanaging' government
agencies; it does and it always has" (1989, 241). More recently, Behn
identified political micromanagement as one of public administration's
most pressing problems and elucidated how it hampers agency performance:
"The legislative branch is, for some reason, unhappy with the way an
executive-branch agency is performing; so the legislators impose some
rules on the agency ... These new rules prevent, or at least constrain,
the agency from doing what the legislature dislikes. Unfortunately,
these rules also constrain the agency from producing the results for
which it is responsible" (1995, 316). [There is reason to believe that
oversight has become increasingly driven by this impulse to micromanage
and constrain bureaucratic discretion. Summarising a series of 10 case
studies on oversight]{.underline}, Gilmour and Halley concluded: [The
cases show a "congressional co-manager" intervening directly in the
details of policy development and management rather than enacting vague,
wide-ranging, sweeping statutes to change fundamental policy
directions]{.underline} ... Gone almost without a trace is the post-New
Deal Congress that optimistically delegated broad-scale public problems
and policy questions for solution and resolution by the executive
branch. Much diminished as well is an executive branch relied upon by
Congress for neutral competence and specialized expertise. Instead, the
story ... is one of the retrieval of executive discretion and the highly
specific redefinition---by Congress---of prior delegations of authority.
(1994, 335--336) In the same vein, Aberbach (1990) showed that the
average number of pages per statute enacted by Congress rose sharply
between the 80th (1947--1948) and the 103rd (1993--1994) sessions of
Congress, indicating an increased command-and-control orientation in
legislative-bureaucratic relations. More recently, Balla and Deering
(2013) coded a sample of all congressional hearings that occurred during
the 96th (1979--1981), 100th (1987--1989), 104th (1995--1997) and 108th
(2003--2004) sessions of Congress. They found that most hearings -- over
80% in each session -- are police patrols, as opposed to fire alarms,
indicating that Congress has an abiding interest in monitoring what the
federal bureaucracy is doing and in how it is doing it. As a recent
illustration of this mechanism, scholarly research and witness testimony
from administrators from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
(CMS) attest that members of Congress are keen to micromanage policies
governing provider payment (Pham et al. 2009). [Besides this
micromanagement mechanism, there are at least two more possible avenues
by which oversight may harm agency morale. First, preparing for and
participating in oversight hearings, especially high-profile ones,
levies opportunity costs on agency employees. Rather than focussing on,
say, fulfilling their missions, or competently implementing legislative
policy, agency employees must respond to the priorities of a committee
holding an oversight hearing. We call these opportunity costs short
term]{.underline} to differentiate them from the more fundamental (and
psychological) crowding-out of experienced meaning that congressional
micromanagement entails. Finally, [it is reasonable to assume that
negative congressional attention whose aim is to publicly embarrass
high-level agency managers would be demoralising to the agency as a
whole. A recent example of this involves the General Services
Administration (GSA) and the attention it received in 2012, after
stories of wasteful spending at its Western Regions Conference surfaced
in the media]{.underline}. The aftermath included many high-profile
oversight hearings and numerous internal reports that sought to assign
responsibility for the agency's actions. As "fraud, waste and abuse" are
anathema to both parties, Democrats as well as Republicans relentlessly
attacked the GSA in hearings. In this instance, Congress can be seen to
have had a genuine interest in improving GSA performance into the
future. In other words[, this was an ideal opportunity for Congress to
act as a genuine performance manager -- that is, to take a sincere
interest in remedying whatever underlying organisational
problems]{.underline} (e.g. issues with organisational culture,
ineffective internal accountability structures, etc.) [may have
contributed to the GSA scandal. Instead, Congress appeared to be more
interested in obtaining whatever political mileage it could by publicly
scolding top-level GSA employees.]{.underline}

Had Democrats decisively won control of the White House and the Senate,
there would be a robust conversation around legislatively expanding the
federal government's authority for technology oversight. While this
conversation would take a backseat to issues like fighting the COVID-19
pandemic and shoring up the economy, legislation on new data privacy and
algorithmic consumer protections could have had a chance in the first
term of the Biden administration. Even a technology oversight agency
would have been possible, and perhaps still is, pending the results from
the Georgia special elections. Yet, even without a Democratic majority
in the Senate, there are meaningful steps that the Biden administration
can take to further reasonable oversight of the technology sector, and
specifically the largely unregulated use of artificial intelligence (AI)
and algorithmic decision-making. The Biden administration can reverse
Trump-era executive orders and agency regulations, instead requiring
federal agencies to enforce existing discrimination laws on algorithmic
systems and expanding their regulatory capacity to do so.
[President-elect Biden should push Congress to enact new algorithmic
consumer protections in any new legislative compromises on privacy or
antitrust, and further support the revival of the Office of Technology
Assessment. These efforts are likely not sufficient in the long
term]{.underline}. The digital economy accounts for over 9% of
GDP--larger than the finance sector--and was growing at 6.8% per year
before the pandemic. Since the rise of the modern regulatory state in
the 1970s, perhaps no other segment of the overall economy has
experienced such growth while remaining largely unregulated. Even that
framing understates the importance of data systems and algorithms, which
are affecting nearly every part of our society. While the economic
growth is undeniable, [the mass proliferation of data systems and
algorithms---especially in the form of permissionless innovation---has
enabled extensive societal harms. A new regulatory agency, or expanded
capacity of an existing agency such as the Federal Trade Commission, is
necessary]{.underline}. For now, however, the Biden administration
should take the available steps to curtail the direct harms, especially
algorithmic discrimination, enabled by AI. EXECUTIVE ACTIONS TO ENFORCE
EXISTING LAWS [The use of algorithmic decision-making in many industries
poses serious challenges for regulatory enforcement of existing
laws]{.underline}. Health insurance companies implement risk prediction
tools that are likely prioritizing care in racially biased ways, which
is illegal for any providers receiving federal funds from programs like
CHIP and Medicaid or insurers participating in the Affordable Care Act
exchanges. AI systems used to perform automated video interviews are
undoubtedly deeply flawed as well, and there is cause for investigation
to see if they discriminate against people with disabilities in
violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act. The algorithms that
manage Uber and Lyft drivers can make decisions that obscure the lines
between employee and independent contractor for purposes of enforcing
the Fair Labor Standards Act. However, the Office of Civil Rights within
the Department of Health and Human Services, the Equal Opportunity
Employment Commission, and the Department of Labor, respectively, may
not be equipped to handle these questions. [The Biden administration
should be more proactive than the Trump White House, which took minimal
action to avoid problems associated with the use of
algorithms.]{.underline} Following a February 2019 executive order, the
Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued its final guidance on the
regulation of artificial intelligence on Nov. 17, 2020. While there are
serious and reasonsed aspects of the document, [it makes clear that AI
innovation, and not regulatory protection, is the foremost
priority]{.underline} of the Trump administration. For instance, while
it seems encouraging that the guidance includes mention of "fairness and
non-discrimination" as well as "disclosure and transparency," these were
part of a long list of required considerations before implementing new
regulations. A careful reading of this document---such as the section
offering a series of non-regulatory interventions---suggests it is meant
to deter, not encourage or enable, new regulatory safeguards for AI
applications. It is possible that this is an overly critical reading of
the White House guidance---to its credit, it does prompt agencies to
think more about AI regulation. However, [the status quo is untenable,
as it functionally inoculates companies from anti-discrimination laws
when they use algorithms.]{.underline} Since this guidance from OMB
Director Russell Vought downplays the well-documented discriminatory
harms from some AI systems, the Biden administration should amend this
guidance to ensure that current law is appropriately enforced on
algorithmic systems. [Specific agency-level guidance needs reversal as
well, such as a rule from the Department of Housing and Urban
Development that places an insurmountable burden of proof on claims of
discrimination against algorithms used for mortgage loan or rental
applications.]{.underline} In order to execute on this guidance,
[federal agencies will need the capacity to investigate algorithmic
systems.]{.underline} These ex-post audits should focus on highly
impactful, large-scale AI systems, and especially those that have
already been implicated by nonprofits and academic evaluations. While it
may seem as though this would require the models themselves, this is far
less important than access to the underlying datasets and model outputs.
[Therefore, regulatory agencies should use available administrative
subpoena powers to gain access to the relevant corporate
datasets]{.underline}. There are already about 335 of these authorities
across the federal government. T[he auditing of these massive data
systems may be a daunting task for many agencies. In order to support
this new responsibility, the Biden administration should direct the
United States Digital Service (USDS) to hire a line of data scientists
and engineers to support the algorithmic regulatory capacity of federal
agencies.]{.underline} USDS has been a successful initiative to bring
technical talent into the federal government to modernize services, and
it is well-positioned to bring in the talent needed to build secure data
environments and conduct algorithmic audits. The Biden administration
should make this endeavor a policy priority, using hiring authority
within the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and
Presidential Innovation Fellowships to bring in more expertise. Lastly,
Biden should also endorse the revival of the Office of Technology
Assessment, which seeks to provide Congress with additional capacity and
more informed technology sector oversight. The fast pace of
technological development and proliferation has left Congress behind,
especially since the defunding of the original Office of Technology
Assessment in 1995. Further, congressional offices have reduced staff
funding in their Washington offices, leading to younger,
less-experienced staff working on a larger number of policy issues. This
is hardly an ideal outcome for handling the novel and complex challenges
posed for AI and technology governance. Of course, this is not to argue
that the Biden administration should only work to rein in the use of AI.
[The administration should continue the extensive new funding streams
from the National Science Foundation for National AI
Institutes.]{.underline} The administration should also keep engaging
the Global Partnership on AI, working toward democratic norms for AI's
role in the world. Investing in AI research and working toward global
consensus on AI are both critically important. However, [it is AI
oversight that needs a course correction.]{.underline} To keep citizens
safe from the overuse and abuse of algorithmic systems, the Biden
administration has much work to do---but it also has the tools to get
started.

But intelligence [oversight is complicated and has not sufficiently

of IC programs, [standard oversight processes typically track defined,
pre-determined requirements, cost, and timelines]{.underline}. These
metrics have worked reasonably well for large programs like the
acquisition of satellites and buildings, for which there is a clear
beginning, middle, and end, with easily identifiable milestones and a
definite budget. However, [AI is different; its development moves back
and forth across a spectrum of activities often without discrete
steps]{.underline}, and failure is a necessary part of the process as
the technology evolves and matures. [Traditional metrics are, therefore,
less effective for AI,]{.underline} as the value (or lack thereof) of
certain milestones may only become clear partway through the development
process and desired end-states may shift.

[Expansive]{.underline} new [cyber reporting requirements]{.underline}
now [appear dead in Congress. Congress has cut requirements for
companies to share cyber threat information]{.underline} with the
government from its must-pass defense bill, which passed the House last
night and is expected to pass the Senate shortly. [The failure of such a
popular and bipartisan effort -- which would have marked the largest
expansion of government involvement in private-sector cybersecurity in
years -- raises questions about whether Congress is up to the task of
responding to a wave of ransomware and other attacks that have battered
industry in recent years. It would have required companies in critical
industry sectors such as energy and transportation to alert the
Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency whenever they're hacked
or hit with other significant cyber incidents.]{.underline} It would
have required disclosures from a far broader group of companies if they
paid ransoms to hackers. But the measure also looked meager given the
hacking threats facing industry. More than 90 percent of cyber experts
and current and former officials supported the changes in a recent
Cybersecurity 202 poll. The government has already imposed far more
stringent cyber requirements on several key industry sectors in just the
past few months. "[This result is beyond disappointing and undermines
national security]{.underline}," said House Homeland Security Chairman
Bennie G. Thompson (D-Miss.) and Rep. Yvette Clarke (D-N.Y.), chair of
the committee's cyber panel and a sponsor of the House version of the
bill. Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) wanted to curtail a cyber reporting
provision in a major defense policy bill. It ended up getting cut
entirely. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) [The dispute centered on
the ransomware provision, which Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) considered too
broad, Senate aides told me. Scott wanted to substitute a provision that
would have limited ransomware reports to just critical infrastructure
--- that's a group of 16 industry sectors that includes financial
services, health care and chemical facilities among others. The fight
over the provision lasted so long that by the time they'd reached a
compromise, House and Senate negotiators who were putting together the
final bill ended up leaving it out entirely,]{.underline} as Tim Starks
reports for CyberScoop. The fine print Because of some peculiarities
about how the bill came together this year, lawmakers could still try to
add amendments in the Senate, including the cyber reporting provisions.
But leaders of the House and Senate Armed Services Committees are
begging them not to out of fear one or more of those amendments will
prevent the bill from passing entirely. If that happens, it would mark
the first time in more than five decades Congress has failed to pass the
bill, known as the National Defense Authorization Act. Sen. Gary Peters
(D-Mich.) championed a cyber reporting provision that got cut from the
National Defense Authorization Act. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)
The blame game: Thompson and Clarke laid the blame for provision being
cut at the feet of Senate Republican leaders as did Senate Homeland
Security Chairman Gary Peters (D-Mich.). ["I am disappointed Senate
Republican leaders blocked these common sense provisions that have broad
bipartisan support --- including from the bipartisan leaders of the
Senate Homeland Security and Intelligence Committees,"]{.underline}
Peters said. "Cyberattacks, including ransomware attacks, are one of the
greatest threats to our national and economic security." An aide for
Scott told The Hill's Maggie Miller that [Scott was disappointed the
full provision got left out of the NDAA and that he'd only wanted to
limit its scope. He denied Republicans were to blame.]{.underline}

Currently, existing laws, executive structure, and congressional
oversight mechanisms are a mismatch for the nature of the cybersecurity
challenges presented by a complex, technologically integrated society.
**[Existing mechanisms for congressional cybersecurity oversight are
likewise disjointed and uncoordinated]{.underline}**. Unlike in many
other policy areas[, there is no one clear committee or clear set of
committees responsible for cybersecurity issues]{.underline}. These are
divided among many committees in both the House of Representatives and
the Senate, often along historical lines that may not match current
expertise. [The Judiciary committees often encounter cybersecurity
issues in the context of surveillance, cybercrime enforcement, and
privacy issues]{.underline}. The Armed Services committees are called
upon to consider cybersecurity issues [when evaluating legislation
concerning offensive and defensive cyber capabilities]{.underline},
which are part of the government's response to counter hostile cyber
activities by foreign nation-states. The Intelligence committees engage
on cybersecurity activities most recently from the perspective of
[protecting electoral system infrastructure from foreign influence and
malign cyber activities related to foreign interference]{.underline} in
democratic processes. And the Homeland Security committees are heavily
involved in cybersecurity oversight due to the critical cybersecurity
functions that DHS provides in securing the federal government's
civilian networks and in coordinating information sharing between
government entities and the private sector. **[The lack of a
coordinating function among these committees limits Congress' ability to
obtain a comprehensive picture of the cybersecurity
problem,]{.underline}** particularly when these committees advance
legislation solely from their own jurisdictions.39

To develop a successful cybersecurity approach, [Congress must first be
able to obtain a comprehensive picture of the problem.]{.underline} This
is challenging, and not just because of the lack of committee
coordination. [The complex nature of the problem itself, previously
illustrated, requires gathering information about the interaction of a
large set of actors, economic sectors, and government
departments.]{.underline} How would increased organized criminal
investigative activities impact the incentives of potential nation-state
actors? How would the responses by those foreign actors alter the
availability of malicious tools and code to third parties targeting
private organizations and individuals? How might proposals to legalize
"hacking back" affect adversaries' incentives to engage in false-flag
operations? These are complicated questions spanning many different
areas yet attempts to address any one area impact nearly all others**[.
This is no easy challenge for Congress, made worse by the fact that it
is happening in real time, and pressure to act is growing on executive
agencies Congress must oversee.]{.underline}**

Since January 2019, in the 116th Congress, [there have been at least 13
hearings involving cybersecurity topics.]{.underline} [These 13 hearings
have been conducted by seven different congressional
committees,]{.underline} including three committees in the House of
Representatives and four committees in the Senate. [From January 2017 to
December 2018]{.underline}, in the 115th Congress, [there were at least
56]{.underline} hearings involving cybersecurity topics. [These 56
hearings were conducted by 17 different congressional
committees]{.underline}, including eight committees in the House of
Representatives and seven committees in the Senate. (See Appendix A for
a list of these hearings.) Meanwhile, specific members of Congress have
launched the Cyberspace Solarium Commission, mandated by the 2019
National Defense Authorization Act and comprised of members from both
chambers of Congress, as well as outside experts. The commission is
charged with "evaluating divergent approaches to defending the United
States in cyberspace and driving consensus toward a comprehensive
strategy."40 The commission's recommendations for developing this
strategy are scheduled to be delivered in a 2020 report.

The lack of committee coordination is only one aspect of the problem,
however. There are many different aspects to the cybersecurity problem,
most of which are interrelated and equally vulnerable to adversaries who
seek to compromise U.S. systems. In other words, attackers don't care
how they get in---only that they do. **[Their mechanisms do not neatly
(or even weakly) follow committee jurisdiction.]{.underline}** While the
disjointed committee patchwork could be interpreted as an argument for
intelligence oversight--style reform of congressional committee
structure, this is as deceptively incomplete an answer as is the myth of
information sharing or effective increased deterrence through criminal
penalty. **[Because it is precisely the patchwork nature of the
problem]{.underline}**---which spans questions in national defense, law
enforcement, agriculture, energy, transportation, finance, healthcare,
manufacturing, consumer protection, and a host of other areas---**[that
makes uncoordinated oversight]{.underline}** and legislation challenging
at best. At worst, **[it runs the risk of benefiting adversaries by
promoting a false sense of security when problems are addressed in one
area at the expense of ignoring another.]{.underline}**

[Cybersecurity oversight is due for a reboot.]{.underline} This paper
explores the need for refreshed congressional oversight of
cybersecurity. After laying out why [cybersecurity oversight presents
special challenges]{.underline}, this paper suggests that [the disparate
nature of the cybersecurity policymaking legal framework is mismatched
to the nature of the cybersecurity problem, resulting in difficulty
legislating in this space]{.underline}. It then provides two key
recommendations to guide a congressional cybersecurity oversight reboot.
Cybersecurity is a broad challenge spanning many disciplines and
industries. This paper argues that [the current "patchwork" legal
framework is ill suited]{.underline} to address cybersecurity questions
either for legislative oversight or effective policymaking. The paper
provides an overview of the nature and scope of the cybersecurity
problem, with a focus on how the complexity of the field affects
congressional oversight activities. [Congress has been conducting a
substantial amount of oversight in this area in recent years. Those
efforts, however, have not yet resulted in legislative actions that have
demonstrably improved national cybersecurity]{.underline}. This paper
seeks to aid the effort to craft legal authorities that deal with an
increasingly complex set of cyberthreats. This short exposition provides
a path to rebooting Congress' approach to cybersecurity oversight in a
way that would allow these issues to be addressed more comprehensively.
[Cybersecurity is a complex, integrated challenge spanning topics as
diverse as (but not limited to) international affairs, national security
and defense, criminal law, civil liability, data protection, privacy and
personal responsibility.]{.underline} Cybersecurity also involves many
different actors, ranging from governments to companies to organizations
to individuals. And it involves virtually every type of computing and
information technology in use today, representing a plethora of
technologies far more diverse than the personal computers and servers of
yesteryear. Thus, [perhaps the greatest challenge of developing a
comprehensive cybersecurity governance framework is the fact that it is
a highly complex problem, pervasive and interrelated across many aspects
of government, the private sector, and society.]{.underline} From a
federal government perspective, cybersecurity presents a set of
interrelated challenges. Cybersecurity responses to malign cyber
activities of hostile nation-states cannot be resolved the same way
traditional kinetic defense threats would be handled. For example,
cybersecurity cannot just be handed off to one agency, such as the
Department of Defense (DoD) or the Department of Homeland Security
(DHS). Although those departments play important roles, neither can---as
a result of limits on legal authorities and their appropriate roles and
responsibilities--- address the problem comprehensively. [The current
"patchwork" legal framework is ill suited to address cybersecurity
questions either for legislative oversight or effective
policymaking.]{.underline} Most commonly, the term cybersecurity refers
to some type of defensive technical security problem. Its meaning varies
both descriptively and normatively across industrial sectors, types of
actors, and disciplinary backgrounds. In reality, however, cybersecurity
problems generally describe only one piece of a complex puzzle. The lack
of a framework for defining these issues diminishes the ability of
policymakers to create policy that adequately addresses the full
spectrum of cybersecurity problems. This spectrum is broad and is not
limited to traditional defensive boundaries. It includes strategic and
adversarial planning and operations, spanning parties from private
sector targets to law enforcement to military operations. In a fully
internetworked world of connected appliances, vehicles, Internet of
Things devices, and mobile devices, holistic consideration of
cybersecurity questions is necessary. This discussion takes an expansive
view of the elements that impact "cybersecurity"--- ranging from
technical aspects of system security to principles of international law
in the context of armed conflict. This wide view is unified by the theme
of efforts to improve the health of the U.S. information and computing
infrastructure as an empirical matter, agnostic of any particular
normative policy prescription of consumer protection, economic policy,
or related issues. [The technological aspects of cybersecurity further
complicate this problem in two ways. First, they create a degree of
opacity for nontechnologists in understanding key elements of the
problem. Second, the highly technical nature of cybersecurity lends
itself to the false belief that technical measures can provide complete
solutions. Nothing could be further from the truth.]{.underline} Indeed,
solutions focusing on technological "silver bullets" often are
beneficial to adversaries because of the false sense of security they
provide. Many of the most effective methods of "hacking" often rely on
human vectors. Just as a technological perimeter is an infeasible system
in an interconnected world, a cyber border defended by the Armed Forces
is impractical.

**[The lack of congressional oversight of offensive cyber operations
under the Intelligence Authorization Act also likely does not seriously
shift the balance between congressional and executive war-making
powers]{.underline}**. The reason is inherent in the limitations of the
legislation itself: the Intelligence Authorization Act specifies
reporting requirements, but does not require the non-use or withdrawal
of forces.234 Further, these reports must be made in a "timely" fashion
(the definition of which is undefined) and only to a small number of
Congressmen (at most eight).235 [**Thus even if the President had to
report offensive cyber operations to Congress, it is unclear he would
have to do so in a way that gave Congress an effective
check**,]{.underline} [as these reports would be made only to a small
group of Congressmen (who would not be able to share the information,
because of its classified nature, with other members of the
legislature]{.underline}) and could be done well after the employment of
these capabilities. The resulting picture is one of increased
presidential flexibility; the War Powers Resolution and the Intelligence
Authorization Act---while arguably ineffective in many
circumstances---provide increased congressional oversight of
presidential war-making actions such as troop deployments and covert
actions[. Yet these statutes do not cover offensive cyber operations,
giving the President an increasingly powerful foreign policy tool
outside congressional reach.]{.underline}

**[2AC\-\--Oversight Fails\-\--Polarization]{.underline}**

**A polarized congress fails to successfully limit the power of the
president**

Finally and, for my purposes, most significant, [party polarization
contributes to the rise of presidential unilateralism]{.underline}.
[When the Congress is polarized, members of the President\'s party are
not likely to break ranks and vote to limit presidential
initiatives]{.underline}. When government is unified, this means that no
bill will get through Congress to limit presidential initiatives. [When
Congress is divided, members of the President\'s party will resist any
opposition party efforts to repudiate the President. More than that,
since divided government is increasingly common]{.underline} (thirty of
the past forty years), it is also increasingly difficult for Congress to
enact significant legislation. As such, [Presidents have even more
incentive to act unilaterally-since they cannot get Congress to enact
their legislative agenda]{.underline} Consider, for example, Bill
Clinton\'s health care reforms and George W. Bush\'s faith-based
initiatives. In both instances, [the President went to Congress seeking
legislative authorization for his policy agenda. In both cases, Congress
did not bite, leaving it to the President either to abandon his policy
initiative or pursue his initiative through unilateral
action.]{.underline} Clinton did so by issuing several directives that,
among other things, \"established a patient\'s bill of rights for
federal employees . . . and set penalties for companies that deny health
coverage to the poor and people with pre-existing medical
conditions.\"51 [Bush]{.underline} likewise [acted
unilaterally]{.underline}, establishing the White House Office of Faith
Based Initiatives and ordering an audit of government agencies to make
sure that their practices did not improperly discourage or forbid
faith-based organizations.5 2 [Political polarization]{.underline},
moreover, [encourages Presidents to act unilaterally and take greater
control of the administrative state.]{.underline} Specifically[, with
political polarization and divided government shifting the locus of
government policymaking away from lawmaking and towards executive and
administrative action, Presidents]{.underline} (beginning with Ronald
Reagan) [have used the Office of Management and Budget to review agency
policymaking]{.underline}.53 Likewise, in an effort to ensure that
agency policymaking conforms to the President\'s policy agenda[,
Presidents]{.underline} (again beginning with Ronald Reagan) [have made
use of signing statements and pre-regulatory directives.]{.underline}54
[Finally, Presidents have used their appointments power to ensure agency
loyalty to the President\'s agenda]{.underline}.55 More than any
President before him, George W. Bush pushed the boundaries of
presidential unilateralism. \"What almost no one disputes,\" wrote Adam
Liptak in The New York Times, \"is that a central legacy of the Bush
presidency will be its distinctively muscular vision of executive
power.\" 56 The architect of this campaign was Vice President Dick
Cheney. 7 A witness to Watergate and its aftermath, Cheney helped staff
the \"White House with conservative veterans of the 1970s and 1980s who
believed that\" the President should push his agenda \"without having to
compromise\" and that Watergate-era reforms had wrongly \"emasculated
the presidency.\"\'5 8 More to the point, just as the Nixon
administration pushed the boundaries of executive power, the Bush
administration extended the efforts of Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton to
assert broad inherent power over national security, to [make use of
executive orders to unilaterally advance policy objectives, and to
centralize presidential control of the administrative
state]{.underline}. To cite a few well known examples: [the assertion of
the power to indefinitely detain so-called enemy combatants, the
establishment of a military tribunal system without formal congressional
approval, the warrantless wiretapping of U.S. citizens, the robust use
of executive privilege, and the expansive use of presidential signing
statements to direct agency policymaking-including agency
non-enforcement of laws that the President deems
unconstitutional.]{.underline}

The interview was a rough listen: two political allies frustrated with
each other and with the reality that accountability in Washington, D.C.,
is hard. Hugh Hewitt seemed to think that a subpoena from Chairman Ron
Johnson's committee to James Comey would force the former FBI Director
to confess his role in an attempted coup on President Donald Trump---if
Johnson only had the guts to issue it. [Johnson seemed to think that he
was powerless to force more transparency on the issues that concern
Hewitt and his conservative radio audience. Both are
mistaken]{.underline}. [Similar conversations are often heard on the
other side of the political spectrum too, as the base of each party
demands that the subject of the latest outrage be "hauled" up to Capitol
Hill and "grilled" under the TV lights. Except that almost never
works.]{.underline} From Ollie North 33 years ago to Bill Barr three
weeks ago, it hardly ever goes well for the committee or satisfies the
base voters hungry for red meat. [Sally Yates versus Lindsey Graham is
another recent example. This model of congressional
hearing---confronting a lone hostile witness---has an awful track
record. It should be obvious why. Who's going to do most of the talking?
The witness chews up most of the clock arguing with the premise of
hostile questions from one side of the aisle and fielding soft balls
from allies on the other. By contrast, in a well-designed hearing, a
majority of the witnesses testify to facts that the majority of the
committee wants to highlight. At its best, a congressional hearing tells
a story with friendly witnesses]{.underline}. Victims and whistleblowers
should outnumber villains. And a credible, neutral figure, like an
inspector general or subject matter expert, can refute any disingenuous
political spin. But [even a well-designed hearing is a bad way to gather
facts.]{.underline} That's not its purpose. The hearing comes after
doing the hard work behind the scenes. [That means first scouring reams
of documents and questioning key witnesses with trained, professional
interrogators who don't need to play to the cameras for sound bites.
It's not sexy, but it's effective.]{.underline} Unfortunately, too many
judge the success of oversight by the amount of press coverage rather
than the facts uncovered. [The media and Members alike prefer the
dopamine of the confrontation over data. These one-witness show trials,
where politicians grandstand and berate a single "target" witness simply
don't work, no matter how much people might want them for the
entertainment value or how much a chairman might fancy himself as Perry
Mason]{.underline}. If Senator Johnson could subpoena James Comey to
appear on Hugh Hewitt's radio program, it would be quite a show even
though we probably wouldn't learn much. Comey has already testified
multiple times on Trump-Russia issues. Of course, Hugh Hewitt doesn't
have to yield half of his time to adversaries like Kamala Harris on the
other side. Senator Johnson does. Outside critics like Hewitt are right
to be frustrated with how ineffective congressional oversight has
become. However, [they need to understand the process, study the
procedural limitations that committee chairmen face, and work
constructively to support reforms that could make a real
difference.]{.underline} Sometimes [the problem]{.underline} is lack of
guts, but [more often, it's a lack of experience, procedural tools, and
the expertise to use them.]{.underline} A subpoena is not a magic
bullet. In the modern era, [Congress has essentially forgotten how to
enforce them. It abandoned the historical practice of using its inherent
constitutional authority to impose consequences directly on witnesses
who are in contempt]{.underline}. Now, it turns to the Executive or
Judicial Branches for help rather than standing up for itself and the
people it's elected to represent. [Reclaiming the Legislative Branch's
proper role as the First Branch of government would mean re-learning the
full scope of its own authorities and summoning the political will to
use them.]{.underline} It would mean allocating resources to recruit and
retain more senior, more experienced staff---or failing that,
contracting with top-notch outside professionals to help do battle with
the legal talent arrayed against it. [The most effective practitioners
of legislative oversight have been long-serving, career
legislators]{.underline}---like John Dingell and my former boss, Chuck
Grassley---who stay close to their constituents back home while devoting
significant time and staff resources to the job of acting as a check and
balance on the Executive Branch. Too few aspire to be like Dingell and
Grassley. Too many Members and staff see their time on Capitol Hill as
just a stepping stone to something bigger and better, and it shows.
[Rather than just cursing the problem, critics could help by focusing on
solutions. There are organizations working to strengthen the Legislative
Branch to serve the people it represents more effectivel]{.underline}y.
If you are concerned about countering the permanent, unelected
bureaucracy in Washington, then you should join them in working for a
stronger, more competent Congress.

At least [since Watergate, if not for longer, the executive branch has
recognized the important role congressional oversight plays in the
constitutional system and has understood itself to have a constitutional
obligation to accommodate legitimate oversight requests from
Congress]{.underline}. This long-standing executive branch perspective
is embodied in a 1982 memorandum to all agency heads regarding how to
respond to congressional requests, often referred to as the Reagan memo.
[This memorandum, which remains in force, explicitly states that it is
executive branch policy "to comply with congressional requests for
information to the fullest extent consistent with the constitutional and
statutory obligations of the Executive Branch."]{.underline} While the
Reagan memo recognizes there may be times when it is necessary to
withhold information to protect important executive branch
confidentiality interests, [it emphasizes the expectation that such
impasses should be rare and limited to "compelling circumstances."
Instead, the Reagan memo underscores the importance of engaging in a
good faith negotiation to accommodate the interests of both branches:
"Historically, good faith negotiations between Congress and the
Executive Branch have minimized the need for invoking executive
privilege, and this tradition of accommodation should continue as the
primary means of resolving conflicts between the Branches."]{.underline}
This process of good faith negotiation has become known as the
accommodation process. To be sure, in nearly every administration since
the Reagan memo, there have been a handful of contentious issues where a
dispute between Congress and the executive branch regarding access to
executive branch information reached a high-profile impasse. These
instances of interbranch conflict have been controversial matters that
garnered significant media coverage and public interest. But [the
salience of these occasional instances of conflict should not obscure
the extent to which the branches have been able to resolve the vast
majority of disputes through good faith engagement in the accommodation
process. Every year Congress issues hundreds if not thousands of
oversight requests to the White House and executive branch agencies. Yet
the number of disputes that reach the level of public consciousness in a
presidential term can usually be counted on one hand. This is because in
most oversight matters, the branches reach a reasonable accommodation,
which often includes some disclosure of agency information arguably
subject to a potential executive privilege claim, and thus avoid impasse
and escalation.]{.underline} [This approach to accommodation is not
driven just by policy but also by recognition of a constitutional
obligation to seek such reasonable accommodations]{.underline}. The U.S.
Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit has explained this constitutional
mandate in a manner worth quoting at length in light of present
circumstances: The framers \... expect\[ed\] that where conflicts in
scope of authority arose between the coordinate branches, a spirit of
dynamic compromise would promote the resolution of the dispute in the
manner most likely to result in efficient and effective functioning of
our governmental system. Under this view, the coordinate branches do not
exist in an exclusively adversarial relationship to one another when a
conflict in authority arises. Rather, each branch should take cognizance
of an implicit constitutional mandate to seek optimal accommodation
through a realistic evaluation of the needs of the conflicting branches
in the particular fact situation. \* \* \* \[Because\] it was a
deliberate feature of the constitutional scheme to leave the allocation
of powers unclear in certain situations, the resolution of conflict
between the coordinate branches in these situations must be regarded as
an opportunity for a constructive modus vivendi, which positively
promotes the functioning of our system. The Constitution contemplates
such accommodation. Negotiation between the two branches should thus be
viewed as a dynamic process affirmatively furthering the constitutional
scheme. In 1981, [Reagan's attorney general described the essence of
this process:]{.underline} "The accommodation required is not simply an
exchange of concessions or a test of political strength. [It is an
obligation of each branch to make a principled effort to acknowledge,
and if possible to meet, the legitimate needs of the other branch."
There are important ramifications of recognizing a constitutionally
based obligation to engage in a serious and good faith effort to reach a
reasonable accommodation when there is a disagreement between the
branches]{.underline}. Every executive branch official swears an oath to
uphold the Constitution upon taking office, and this commitment should
be understood to include the constitutional mandate to engage in good
faith to seek reasonable accommodations.

[Yesterday the Biden administration announced that it would send an
additional \$1 billion in military aid to Ukraine as the country
continues to combat invading Russian forces.]{.underline} The new aid
package comes on the heels of The Wall Street Journal reporting earlier
this week that the U.S. is now \"sending roughly \$130 million a day in
military aid to Ukraine plus economic and other assistance.\" [American
financial support for Ukraine has largely been uncontroversial in
Congress. Lawmakers approved a \$40 billion aid package in May, adding
billions of dollars to the money President Joe Biden originally
requested.]{.underline} \"The leaders of both parties raised few
questions about how much money was being spent or what it would be used
for,\" wrote The New York Times. Just 11 senators voted against the
bill\'s passage as it breezed through Congress. One of them, [Sen. Rand
Paul (R--Ky.), drew criticism from both parties for delaying Senate
approval of the \$40 billion package after expressing concern that
Congress was \"trying yet again to ram through a spending bill\" and had
failed to outline oversight mechanisms]{.underline}. [Paul
unsuccessfully sought to add language to the bill appointing an
inspector general to supervise the spending.]{.underline} Meanwhile,
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R--Ky.) emphasized the need to
get help to Ukraine \"right now,\" and Senate Majority Leader Chuck
Schumer (D--N.Y.) charged that Paul \"doesn\'t want to aid Ukraine.\"
Unfortunately[, those arguments are helping lawmakers avoid important
debates about the amount and nature of aid the U.S. is sending to
Ukraine, as well as the potential for future misuse as billions of
fast-passed dollars flood into a war zone without proper
over]{.underline}sight. [American politicians have chosen a risky course
of action and are neglecting to realistically discuss the U.S. role in
this conflict]{.underline}. [American officials told The Wall Street
Journal that they have \"little direct knowledge\" of where equipment
goes once it reaches the Ukrainian government]{.underline}. [One
military aid component of the May package, totaling \$6 billion, is a
transfer account that Congress doesn\'t have strong control
over.]{.underline} \"The statutory language requires that \[the
Department of Defense\] report to Congress 15 days before any transfers
occur,\" explains the Center for Strategic International Studies.
\"Congress could block such transfers, but that is difficult to do
politically and procedurally.\" [Oversight experts warn that issues
surrounding transfers are inevitable. \"Even if it\'s a noble cause,
there\'s going to be theft. There\'s going to be
misconduc]{.underline}t,\" warned Special Inspector General for
Afghanistan Reconstruction John Sopko, whose office has uncovered
rampant misuse of U.S. funds that took place during nation-building
efforts in Afghanistan. \"[If there\'s one thing we learned from
Afghanistan, you\'ve got to have oversight in the beginning.\" Many
components of the May package and other aid installments deserve more
scrutiny from lawmakers than they have received. Not-insignificant
chunks of money are going toward countering \"Russian disinformation and
propaganda narratives,\" bolstering the Department of Justice\'s
\"efforts to pursue high value asset seizures from sanctioned
individuals]{.underline},\" paying the salaries of Ukrainian government
officials, and prepping munitions for military skirmishes that aren\'t
related to the conflict in Ukraine. In rushing the passage of aid,
Congress has neglected to debate whether these are appropriate spending
priorities for the U.S.---especially, as Paul notes, when the American
economy is already in such bad shape. [And there\'s a deeper, more
conflict-relevant concern at hand. The end goals for U.S. assistance are
still murky, even as American politicians repeat their opposition to
Russian aggression and support for Ukraine regaining its territory and
sovereignty]{.underline}. Rajan Menon, director of the Grand Strategy
program at Defense Priorities and a professor at the City College of New
York, argues that the U.S. must determine what its precise aims are in
order to shape responsible policy. Without establishing clear
objectives, politicians can shift the goal posts and more easily justify
staying involved. Menon asks, for instance, whether the eventual goal is
to restore Ukrainian borders to their pre-2022 state or if it\'s to
reclaim Crimea. \"[The latter is...ambitious, it\'s far more dangerous,
and it will make the war even longer than \[it\] otherwise will
be]{.underline},\" Menon explains. \"[To say...this is all up to Ukraine
to decide is to overlook the fact that we are its principal arms
supplier and therefore are deeply implicated in this war.
K]{.underline}yiv is certainly entitled to make its choices but that
doesn\'t release us from the obligation to make our one.\" In eschewing
proper debate over military aid to Ukraine, American lawmakers are
opting out of an uncomfortable---but necessary---conversation. \"If we
ramp up arms supplies to Ukraine, which is already urgently calling for
more, we should take into account that Russia may at some point treat us
as a co-belligerent,\" Menon points out. \"Simply assuming that that
would be a bridge too far for them would be a mistake.\" U.S.
politicians need to discuss the line not to be crossed before America is
effectively acting as a co-combatant rather than allowing Russia to make
that determination itself. Providing military aid to Ukraine strikes
many Americans as the right move. It might seem like the best available
option, given that alternatives include putting American boots on the
ground or securing a no-fly zone over Ukrainian airspace---both of which
would prove disastrous. [But those impulses don\'t relieve U.S.
lawmakers of their responsibility to ensure aid is being directed toward
appropriate uses and being used properly. To willingly avoid those
discussions all but ensures that the war in Ukraine will be another
conflict involving fiscal irresponsibility on America\'s
part.]{.underline}

As the Senate works to pass the almost \$40 billion in emergency
supplemental funds for Ukraine just passed by the House, leaders in
Washington must also ensure proper oversight of this spending. They can
and must do both quickly. [The Biden administration and Senate must also
prioritize installing permanent inspectors general to government
agencies so they can monitor aid to Ukraine. These independent watchdogs
can ensure that taxpayer money is not siphoned off by fraudsters or war
profiteers and that weapons remain in the hands of the Ukrainian
military]{.underline}. [The simplest route would be to install permanent
inspectors general at existing offices tasked with doling out the aid
and ensure those offices have the resources they need to oversee surge
funding like]{.underline} this. The Pentagon and State Department, the
two agencies overseeing the bulk of spending for Ukraine assistance, are
both missing permanent internal watchdogs --- and the Pentagon has been
missing one for over six years [The need for effective inspectors
general is already apparent given the level and nature of U.S.
assistance committed to Ukraine]{.underline}. [The speed at which the
U.S. has transferred this defense material to the country presents real
oversight challenges in terms of both spending and monitoring its
use.]{.underline} Oversight and monitoring of arms transfers are

challenging to monitor whether U.S. arms are staying in the hands of the

Security cooperation is often behind the news we read at night but
rarely the frontline story. Luckily [we're]{.underline} also [blessed
with another influential group that **cares deeply**]{.underline} [about
security cooperation]{.underline} -- the **[Congress]{.underline}**. [In
FY **'17** Congress undertook the **largest**]{.underline}, **[most
sweeping]{.underline}**, [and **most substantial** reforms to
**s**ecurity **c**ooperation in our nation's history]{.underline}.
[The]{.underline} FY '17 [NDAA **consolidated** dozens of authorities
into a narrow band of activities]{.underline} in Chapter 16. [It set up
requirements for **human rights vetting**]{.underline}, [**institutional
capacity building**, and assessment **monitoring** and
**evaluation**]{.underline}.

With lots of work in the trenches by both DOD and Congress, this all hit
at once, and it was welcome. Implementing an ambitious vision remains a
challenge, particularly for those activities that were funded out of
service accounts or regional initiatives. Many security cooperation
activities were not being looked at holistically across the spectrum.
Programs were siloed and oversight sometimes limited.

[Congress believed that the entire system needed
**oversight**]{.underline} from a single executor with visibility across
all the authorities and all the different pots of money. This is how we
got the Title 10, Chapter 16, Section 382 in the U.S. Code. The notion
that the secretary's designee, the undersecretary of defense for policy
-- my immediate boss -- shall have, quote, "the responsibility for the
oversight of strategic policy guidance and the responsibility of overall
resource allocation for security cooperation programs and activities of
the Department of Defense." End quote.

[This is where we are]{.underline} trying to go with security
cooperation: [a **holistic** DOD-wide enterprise with visibility across
the spectrum of security cooperation activities, administered with
policy **oversight**, and **aligned tightly** to strategy]{.underline}.

How we define security cooperation is changing as well. At one point
security cooperation meant -- basically meant train and equip programs.
We're moving away from that. Security cooperation enterprise now
encompasses everything from equipment, to training, to conventional arms
sales, to exercises with both high-end and developing partners.

Meanwhile, [we are prioritizing **interoperability**]{.underline} [and
making arms sales **quicker** and more **efficient**]{.underline}. In
the last 10 years the department has reduced the average time to process
foreign military sales by 30 percent. And I know our colleagues at DSCA
are working hard to streamline things even more.

[We are also trying to **move off** of year-to-year
planning]{.underline}. My office has been involved in a push over the
last two years to align security cooperation planning with planning,
programming, budgeting, and execution cycle as well as the global force
management cycle, planning two years out from the current fiscal year.

Further, [we are]{.underline} trying to look at security cooperation
programs as more life-cycle events, [planning **five years out** from
conception, evaluating them annually, and ensuring that security
cooperation activities are built with **specific
achievable**]{.underline}, **[measurable]{.underline}** [objectives in
mind]{.underline}. We're also looking at how to make our investments
sustainable and effective. A big part of this revolves around
institutional capacity building using our experience as a department to
help partners develop their defense ministry apparatus. We are still
working on the best ways to do this, but this is critical to our
mission. Merely transferring equipment or providing training is
insufficient if the partner military lacks the professional and
bureaucratic apparatus to effectively absorb and employ their
capabilities.

One tool that has helped us cover down and provide engagement in this
field has been our regional centers. We have five of them. The George C.
Marshall Center in Germany is just one example. Last week they held an
important and timely conference on Ukrainian defense reform efforts.
Engagements such as these are valuable, and they're not very expensive.
The regional centers provide an excellent example of how small
investments can yield high returns over time.

The state partnership program has also proved a cost-effective,
small-footprint tool for supporting security cooperation goals of the
geographic combatant commands and our diplomatic community. Over the
last 24 years, we have established 73 partnerships with 79 countries
across all six geographic commands. These partnerships have brought
diplomatic and military engagement via the national guard elements
resulting in individual, professional, and institutional contacts and
relationships, enhancing influence and trust on a worldwide basis.
