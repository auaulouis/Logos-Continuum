2. Analysis of [NATO as an Institution for Zero-Day Trade]{.underline}
Discussions

[[NATO is]{.mark} an influential body]{.underline}, and, if it addressed
trade in [zero-days]{.underline}, its [policies would have **global
importance**.]{.underline} [NATO]{.underline} [has]{.underline} been
relatively successful in addressing new collective defense challenges,
so it may have **[the institutional flexibility to take on
zero-days]{.underline}**. NATO [membership maps well with participants
in the zero-day market, including countries with notable buyers and
sellers.]{.underline} Additionally, because NATO is a collective defense
organization for allies, [conceptions of the underlying security problem
and opinions about approach may be more aligned than among states not
engaged in collective defense.]{.underline} **[[Given the difficulties
of other forms of international coop]{.mark}eration, [achieving
consensus among allies might be strategically
attractive]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

[NATO]{.underline} [has developed a focus on cyber defense, and
zero-days are relevant to that agenda]{.underline}. Not only could
**[[trade in zero-days]{.mark} [facilitate attacks against NATO
networks]{.mark}]{.underline}**, but the [[stockpiling]{.mark} behavior
of member states]{.underline} also **[[leaves]{.mark} other
[members]{.mark} [vulnerable]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Key NATO members,
such as]{.underline} [the United States]{.underline} and United Kingdom,
[are purchasers of
zero-days]{.underline}. [327](https://advance-lexis-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/document/?pdmfid=1516831&crid=af1d795a-cfe3-4e91-9dd9-df15f57509a0&pddocfullpath=%2Fshared%2Fdocument%2Fanalytical-materials%2Furn%3AcontentItem%3A5J0C-R6K0-02C9-B0YX-00000-00&pdcontentcomponentid=292707&pdteaserkey=sr4&pditab=allpods&ecomp=szznk&earg=sr4&prid=87902115-d576-4fb1-9e09-38944f5332d7) NATO\'s
[commitment to cyber defense has resulted in the development of a cyber
policy- and decision-making structure and processes that could also be
used to address the zero-day issue without significant
alteration.]{.underline}

Despite this institutional base, [NATO would have to experience a policy
shift]{.underline} before [addressing]{.underline}
[zero-days.]{.underline} Zero-days are
inherently [ \[\*479\] ](https://advance-lexis-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/document/?pdmfid=1516831&crid=af1d795a-cfe3-4e91-9dd9-df15f57509a0&pddocfullpath=%2Fshared%2Fdocument%2Fanalytical-materials%2Furn%3AcontentItem%3A5J0C-R6K0-02C9-B0YX-00000-00&pdcontentcomponentid=292707&pdteaserkey=sr4&pditab=allpods&ecomp=szznk&earg=sr4&prid=87902115-d576-4fb1-9e09-38944f5332d7) exploitable:
although they have significant implications for cyber defense, [they are
also closely tied with **offensive capabilities**]{.underline} of member
states and the potential for NATO offensive capabilities. NATO, as an
organization, is currently not positioned to discuss offensive cyber
issues and has demonstrated wariness of an expanded cyber mandate.
Still, as demonstrated by Libya and Russia\'s actions in Crimea, [cyber
is an increasing reality of security threats facing NATO.]{.underline}
**[[NATO must address cyber capabilities]{.mark}, not just passive cyber
defense.]{.underline}** [Zero-days, as a technology that overlaps both
categories, could be a useful place to start this shift.]{.underline}

If this shift occurred, [**[NATO]{.underline}**
[could]{.underline}]{.mark} [use its existing structure to [foster
guidelines for addressing zero-days]{.mark}.]{.underline}
[The]{.underline} Cyber Defense Management Board ([CDMB]{.underline}),
which implemented the 2011 Action Plan, [could be a starting place for
discussions about zero-day policy]{.underline}. [NATO could do this in
several ways, including using CDMB to increase transparency and
information sharing about zero-day issues within member
states.]{.underline}

For instance, [[NATO could establish zero-day]{.mark} a
**[threat-sharing program]{.mark}**]{.underline}[, [in which governments
**share info**]{.underline}]{.mark}[rmation about the nature of the
zero-day threats they face]{.underline}. [[This]{.underline}]{.mark}
kind of [program [would]{.mark}]{.underline} probably **[[be least
resisted by member states]{.underline}]{.mark}**, but NATO could go
further. [[NATO could institute a **group disclosure program**]{.mark}:
[when one member stockpiles a vulnerability, it could also]{.mark}
[disclose]{.mark} the [vulnerability to a NATO
clearinghouse]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[NATO]{.mark} members
[could]{.mark} then [protect themselves against that vulnerability
or]{.mark} [make use of it.]{.mark} **[NATO could]{.mark}** also [push
for harmonized purchasing policies]{.mark}, perhaps [agreeing that NATO
members will only]{.mark} purchase or [stockpile certain vulnerabilities
from certain countries or suppliers]{.mark}]{.underline}.

In comparison, [the zero-days used in cyber weapons require the US to
constantly **discover new vulnerabilities** to maintain a **deployable
cyber arsenal**]{.underline}. Holding a specific zero-day does not
guarantee that the vulnerability will remain unpatched for a prolonged
period of time by the targeted state.59 Complicating this is the fact
that undetected vulnerabilities, once acquired, are rarely used
immediately given the time and resources it takes to construct a cyber
attack.60 In the time between acquisition and use, a patch for the
vulnerability may be released, whether through routine patches or a
specific identification of a security hole, rendering the vulnerability
obsolete. To minimize this, [America deploys several zero-days at once
in a cyber attack to increase the odds that at least one (or more) of
the vulnerabilities remains open to provide system
access]{.underline}.61 Multiple backdoor entry points are preferable
given that America cannot be absolutely certain of what vulnerabilities
the target system will contain62 despite extensive pre-launch cyber
attack testing63 and customization.64 A successful cyber attack needs a
minimum of one undetected vulnerability to gain access to the target
system. [Each successive zero-day that works adds to the **strength**
and **sophistication** of a cyber assault.]{.underline}65 As one
vulnerability is patched, America can still rely on the other undetected
vulnerabilities to continue its cyber strike. Incorporating multiple
undetected vulnerabilities into a cyber attack reduces the need to
create new cyber attacks after each zero-day fails. [Stuxnet, a joint
US-Israel operation, was a cyber attack designed to disrupt Iran's
progress on its nuclear weapons program]{.underline}.66 [The attack was
designed to alter the code of Natanz's computers and industrial control
systems to induce "chronic fatigue," rather than destruction, of the
nuclear centrifuges.]{.underline}67 The precision of Stuxnet ensured
that all other control systems were ignored except for those regulating
the centrifuges.68 [What is notable about Stuxnet is its use of four
zero-day exploits (of which one was allegedly purchased]{.underline})69
in the attack.70 That is, to target one system, Stuxnet entered through
four different backdoors. A target state aware of a specific
vulnerability in its system will enact a patch upon detection and likely
assume that the problem is fixed. Exploiting multiple vulnerabilities
creates variations in how the attack is executed given that different
backdoors alter how the attack enters the target system.71 One patch
does not stop the cyber attack. The use of multiple zero-days thus
capitalizes on a state's limited awareness of the vulnerabilities in its
system. Each phase of Stuxnet was different from its previous phase
which created confusion among the Iranians. Launched in 2009, Stuxnet
was not discovered by the Iranians until 2010.72 Yet even upon the
initial discovery of the attack, who the attacker was remained unclear.
The failures in the Natanz centrifuges were first attributed to insider
error73 and later to China74 before finally discovering the true
culprits.75 [The use of multiple undetected vulnerabilities helped to
obscure the US and Israel as the actual attackers]{.underline}.76 [The
Stuxnet case helps illustrate the **efficacy** of **zero-day attacks**
as a means of **attaining political goals**. Although Stuxnet did not
produce immediate results in terminating Iran's nuclear program, **it
helped buy time** for the Americans to consider other options against
Iran. A nuclear Iran would not only threaten American security but
possibly]{.underline} open a third conflict for America77 in the Middle
East given Israel's proclivity to strike a nuclear Iran first. [Stuxnet
allowed the United States to delay Iran's nuclear program without
resorting to kinetic action]{.underline}.78

**[bio]{.underline}**logical, [and **chem**]{.underline}ical weapons -
[present a **persistent risk**]{.underline} to the U.S. and
international security. If [a **10-kiloton** nuclear bomb, like the one

levels within a half a mile radius that 50-[[**90% percent** of

medical help -- some of them within hours.

When it comes to preventing WMD proliferation, [[we need to be conscious
of]{.mark} both [**state** and **non-state** actors.]{.mark}
No]{.underline}rth [Ko]{.underline}rea continues to [procure sensitive
goods for its nuclear]{.underline} and missile [program]{.underline} in
defiance of sanctions. [[Iran is procuring
missile]{.underline}]{.mark}-related [[goods.]{.underline}]{.mark}
Agents working on behalf of Syria have sought chemical goods on the
commercial market. Several groups, such as **[[A]{.underline}]{.mark}**l
**[[Q]{.underline}]{.mark}**aeda [[and **ISIS**]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[demonstrated interest]{.mark} in acquiring]{.underline} a [**WMD
capability**.]{.underline} We do not have a full picture of who might be
interested in obtaining a WMD capability in the future.

2\. How Proliferation Networks Operate

Stealing or buying a ready-made weapon is a next to impossible feat.
[The]{.underline} main [[path to]{.underline}]{.mark} a [[WMD is]{.mark}
to **[procure]{.mark}**]{.underline} components, material, and
**[[tech]{.underline}]{.mark}**nology and then build a weapon.
[[Because]{.mark} most [goods]{.mark} usable [in]{.mark} a [WMD]{.mark}
program [are]{.mark} **dual-use**]{.underline} in nature, [[with
**indispensable civilian purposes**, they are]{.mark} available [on the
international]{.mark}]{.underline} commercial
[[market.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The international community attempts to minimize the risk that trade in
dual-use and military goods entails. The international export control
regimes and national export control systems are designed to regulate
trade in sensitive items by requiring traders to obtain licenses.
Additionally, the international and unilateral sanctions regimes target
known proliferators.

The goal of proliferators and their agents is to acquire goods that can
contribute to WMD programs without being caught. Proliferators and their
networks continue to defy both export controls and sanctions.

Proliferation networks come in all sizes and shapes. They can be small
or large, loose, or more organized. Those buying WMD-related goods can
be directly connected to proliferator states, or they can do it purely
for profit by inserting themselves into the illicit market to make
money.

Proliferators have perfected methods that help them stay under the
radar.3 One of the standard techniques they use is to buy goods that are
slightly below the controlled threshold. This means that unless
exporting companies are incredibly vigilant,4 they would not apply for
an export license and subject transaction to government scrutiny.
However, these slightly inferior goods can still be used for nefarious
purposes.

There is another method proliferators use to avoid government oversight
and licensing---they pretend they are ordering goods for a domestic
company. In such cases, supplier companies do not have to apply for
licenses.

To avoid export controls and sanctions, proliferators lie about the
end-use and end-user and hide behind front and shell companies all the
time. They never declare that they are buying components for North
Korea's nuclear program, Iran's missile program, or Syria's chemical
arsenal. For example, they can tell a supplying company they need goods
for scientific research or other peaceful purposes. In 2006, an Iranian
company ordered sensitive bioresearch equipment from Norway purportedly
for a scientific laboratory. On closer look, an attentive Norwegian
supplier determined that the equipment Iranians sought was technically
superior to what would be necessary for a civilian lab and that it did
not fit the physical layout of the laboratory.5

Increasingly, shipping companies and vessels are used prominently in
sanction evasion. For example, Iran and North Korea falsify documents,
reflag vessels, and switch off automatic identification systems to avoid
being discovered in the process of illicit transfers of goods.6

Supplier companies that provide goods to proliferators can be complicit
or not complicit. Larger companies have resources to implement strong
internal compliance programs that help them detect any suspicious
orders. But some companies, especially smaller ones, do not have
resources to invest in compliance and remain negligent. In some cases,
supplier companies or individuals within know precisely what they are
doing. They do it either because of ideology (to support a sanctioned
state) or for profit. In one notorious case, a U.S.-based company MKS
Instruments sent pressure transducers to its subsidiary in China after
duly applying for a U.S. export license, thinking that the goods would
be used in China. The co-opted employee of the MKS Instruments'
subsidiary ordered transducers from an unsuspecting parent company and
pretended they would be used by Chinese companies but planned all along
to ship those goods to Iran.7 Pressure transducers can be used in
uranium enrichment centrifuges, making possible the production of
fissile material that can also be used in a nuclear weapon.

[[Proliferators prefer to buy]{.mark} **good [quality
goods]{.mark}**]{.underline} -- mostly [[from the
**U.S.**]{.underline}]{.mark}, European, and Asian suppliers. [This
means]{.underline} that in most cases, [[they have to pay for
those]{.mark} goods [through the **formal financial system**, making
**financial institutions** part of their]{.mark} **proliferation
[schemes]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### Zero-Days Good\-\--2AC

#### Zero-days key to cyber warfighting 

**Cushing '14** \[Seychelle; November 28; M.A. Political Science from
Simon Fraser University; "Leveraging Information as Power: America's
Pursuit of Cyber Security," <http://summit.sfu.ca/item/14703>\]

The Internet has made information seeking easier given its lax security
structure that privileges offense over defence. Where [the
US]{.underline} once relied on its own ingenuity to support its national
security innovations, it [can now]{.underline} also [purchase the
necessary tools keep up with its peer competitors in
cyberspace.]{.underline} [Buying zero days in the vulnerabilities
market]{.underline} thus serves a dual purpose: it [takes away potential
attack tools from its adversaries while building America's own cyber
arsenal]{.underline}. The problem, however, is that zero days may not
work when you need them. Unlike nuclear or conventional weapons, [there
is no guarantee that an acquired zero-day can remain dormant yet
functional.]{.underline} As a result, [the US must consistently
**discover** and **collect zero-days to maintain a deployable cyber
arsenal**]{.underline}. America, despite its cyber superiority, cannot
credibly threaten to use crushing cyber power to defeat its adversaries
without revealing part of its capabilities. Compounding this problem is
the fact that a cyber attack alone, while disruptive, is survivable at
this time. America is thus experiencing a shift in its security
strategy, albeit incrementally. What previously worked in the physical
domain does not necessarily translate into successful primacy in the
electronic domain. Although Cold [War models of deterrence]{.underline}
by denial and retribution may help frame the cyber problem, these models
[will eventually need to give way to new thinking about security in
cyberspace]{.underline}. Deterrence, despite its Cold War successes, is
not enough to stop your adversaries from attacking you in cyberspace.
Instead, **[resiliency]{.underline}** to absorb a cyber attack [will
carry America further in securing a net security advantage.]{.underline}
While absorbing attacks seems counterintuitive, it is a short term risk
that will garner important information. [Resiliency]{.underline} then
[is as much about learning about your adversaries, their capabilities,
and targets, and it is about comparatively measuring your own
vulnerabilities and strengths in cyber offense and defence]{.underline}.
The more information America can acquire, **[the better equipped it will
be to face the cyber threat]{.underline}**. [Preparations]{.underline}
for kinetic conflict are likely to [begin in cyberspace as **states
collect vast information about their adversaries**. Tapping into the
millions of gigabytes of data that passes through the Internet is
necessary to help America **build a better picture of its adversaries'
actions and intent**]{.underline}, [including "the **readiness of
foreign militaries**]{.underline}."250 America, despite its cyber
sophistication, cannot undertake such a task alone.251 Instead, [the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [strategically shares
information]{.underline} and capabilities with its partners [to
influence the intelligence priorities]{.underline} of the Five Eyes.252
Sharing initially puts the United States in a vulnerable position --
exclusive control over a part of its cyber capabilities are conceded to
its partners. From a vulnerable position, American cyber power can
nevertheless influence conditions necessary to execute innovative,
albeit high risk, intelligence operations. Information gathered from
cyber can both reflect the strengths and weaknesses of America's (and by
extension, its adversaries') offensive and defensive capabilities both
within and outside cyberspace. [Amassing an informational
advantage]{.underline} to use against its adversaries [will enable the
US to enhance its security posture]{.underline}.
**[Information]{.underline}**, as the new realm of cyber security
illustrate[s, **is still a growing foundation of power**]{.underline}.
[Leveraging information in cyberspace is key to producing a long-term
net gain in security.]{.underline} In seeking a cyber advantage, [the
United States must endure short-term cyber insecurity. Tipping the
security seesaw]{.underline} may not produce immediate advantages but
instead, can [be understood as a step towards long-term security.
Consistently working to tip the seesaw towards advantage, while managing
the associated vulnerabilities, helps produce a long-term
advantage.]{.underline} The US' ability to enhance its cyber posture
while managing the associated vulnerabilities ultimately produces a net
gain in national security.

#### Innovation is crucial to preventing cyberattack 

**Cushing '14** \[Seychelle; November 28; M.A. Political Science from

Pursuit of Cyber Security," <http://summit.sfu.ca/item/14703>\]

Adversaries study America's cyber tool and techniques "to capitalize on
\[US...\] ideas" for their own strategic advantage.89 On the one hand,
[innovating on its own code allows America to continue executing its
security objectives in cyberspace]{.underline}. On the other hand,
[innovation allows the United States to speculate on how variations in
its attack code may evolve to help anticipate potential attacks from its
adversaries]{.underline}. While the United States may not be able to
close all of its potential vulnerabilities,90 [it can at least flag the
unpatched vulnerabilities most likely exploited in a cyber
strike]{.underline}. Red-teaming cyber games further allow the US to
test both anticipated attacks and potential responses to maintain an
informational advantage.91 [Cyber favours offense over defence given its
lax security architecture]{.underline}. [Sophisticated cyber states that
are able to innovate first will enjoy a relative
advantage.]{.underline}92 Amassing an arsenal of undetected
vulnerabilities does not necessarily produce an immediate, usable
advantage. Instead, these [vulnerabilities provide important information
to gauge the strengths and weaknesses of America's offensive and
defensive capabilities]{.underline}. [Finding undetected
vulnerabilities, and knowing how to exploit those]{.underline},
[positions the US to capitalize on the offense-defence innovation cycle
to preserve a cyber advantage]{.underline}. The strike methods of
nuclear or conventional weapons are largely unchanged and can be used to
great effect. [Cyber weapons]{.underline}, in comparison, [only
successfully work once. Innovation is required to not only manage the
"constant pressure to keep up,"93 but to also **tip the balance of
informational advantage** in your favour]{.underline}.

THIS BOOK is intended to help readers better understand the national
security issues facing the United States today and offer the general
outline of a strategy for dealing with them. [National security
policy]{.underline}---both making it and debating it --- [is harder
today because the issues that are involved are more numerous and varied.
The problem of the day can **change at a moment\'s
notice**]{.underline}. [Yesterday, it might have been proliferation;
today, terrorism; tomorrow, hostile regional powers. Threats are also
more likely to be intertwined]{.underline}---proliferators use the same
networks as narco-traffickers, narco-traffickers support terrorists, and
terrorists align themselves with regional powers. Yet, as worrisome as
these immediate concerns may be, the long-term challenges are even
harder to deal with, and the stakes are higher. Whereas the main Cold
War threat --- the Soviet Union --- was brittle, [most of the potential
adversaries and challengers America now faces are
resilient]{.underline}. In at least one dimension where the Soviets were
weak (economic efficiency, public morale, or leadership), the new
threats are strong. They are going to be with us for a long time. As a
result, we need to reconsider how we think about national security. [The
most important task for U.S. national security today is simply **to
retain the strategic advantage**]{.underline}. This term, from the world
of military doctrine, refers to the overall ability of a nation to
control, or at least influence, the course of events.1 When you hold the
strategic advantage, situations unfold in your favor, and each round
ends so that you are in an advantageous position for the next. When you
do not hold the strategic advantage, they do not. As national goals go,
"keeping the strategic advantage" may not have the idealistic ring of
"making the world safe for democracy" and does not sound as decisively
macho as "maintaining American hegemony." But [keeping the strategic
advantage is critical, because it is essential for just about
**everything** else America hopes to achieve --- promoting freedom,
protecting the homeland, defending its values,]{.underline} preserving
[peace, and so on]{.underline}. The Changing Threat If one needs proof
of this new, dynamic environment, consider the recent record. A search
of the media during the past fifteen years suggests that there were at
least a dozen or so events that were considered at one time or another
[the most pressing national security problem]{.underline} facing the
United States --- and thus the organizing concept for U.S. national
security. What is most interesting is how varied and different the
issues were, and how many different sets of players they involved ---
and how each was replaced in turn by a different issue and a cast of
characters that seemed, at least for the moment, even more pressing.
They [included]{.underline}, roughly in chronological order, [• regional
conflicts]{.underline} --- like Desert Storm --- involving the threat of
war between conventional armies; • [stabilizing "failed
states]{.underline}" like Somalia, where government broke down in toto;
• staying economically competitive with Japan; [• integrating
Russia]{.underline} into the international community after the fall of
communism and [controlling]{.underline} the [nuclear
weapons]{.underline} it inherited from the Soviet Union; [• dealing with
"rogue states]{.underline}," unruly nations like North Korea that engage
in trafficking and proliferation as a matter of national policy; [•
combating international crime]{.underline}, like the scandal involving
the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, or imports of illegal
drugs; [• strengthening]{.underline} international
[institutions]{.underline} for trade as countries in Asia, Eastern
Europe, and Latin America adopted market economies; • responding to
ethnic conflicts and civil wars triggered by the reemergence of culture
as a political force in the "clash of civilizations"; • providing relief
to millions of people affected by natural catastrophes like earthquakes,
tsunamis, typhoons, droughts, and the spread of HIV/AIDS and malaria; •
combating [terrorism]{.underline} driven by sectarian or religious
extremism; • grassroots activism on a global scale, ranging from the
campaign to ban land mines to antiglobalization hoodlums and
environmentalist crazies; • border security and illegal immigration; •
the worldwide [ripple effects of currency fluctuations and the collapse
of confidence in complex financial securities]{.underline}; and • for at
least one fleeting moment, the safety of toys imported from China. There
is some overlap in this list, and one might want to group some of the
events differently or add others. The important point, however, is that
when you look at these problems and how they evolved during the past
fifteen years, you do not see a single lesson or organizing principle on
which to base U.S. strategy. Another way to see the dynamic nature of
today\'s national security challenges is to consider the annual threat
briefing the U.S. intelligence community has given Congress during the
past decade. These briefings are essentially a snapshot of what U.S.
officials worry most about. If one briefing is a snapshot, then several
put together back to back provide a movie, showing how views have
evolved.2 Figure 1 summarizes these assessments for every other year
between 1996 and 2006. It shows when a particular threat first appeared,
its rise and fall in the rankings, and in some cases how it fell off the
chart completely. So, in 1995, when the public briefing first became a
regular affair, the threat at the very top of the list was North Korea.
This likely reflected the crisis that had occurred the preceding year,
when Pyongyang seemed determined to develop nuclear weapons, Bill
Clinton\'s administration seemed ready to use military action to prevent
this, and the affair was defused by an agreement brokered by Jimmy
Carter. Russia and China ranked high as threats in the early years, but
by the end of the decade they sometimes did not even make the list.
Proliferation has always been high in the listings, although the
particular countries of greatest concern have varied. Terrorism made its
first appearance in 1998, rose to first place after the September 11,
2001, terrorist attacks, and remains there today. The Balkans appeared
and disappeared in the middle to late 1990s. A few of the entries today
seem quaint and overstated. Catastrophic threats to information systems
like an "electronic Pearl Harbor" and the "Y2K problem" entered the list
in 1998 but disappeared after 2001. (Apparently, after people saw an
airliner crash into a Manhattan skyscraper, the possible loss of their
Quicken files seemed a lot less urgent.) Iraq first appeared in the
briefing as a regional threat in 1997 and was still high on the list a
decade later---though, of course, the Iraqi problem in the early years
(suspected weapons of mass destruction) was very different from the
later one (an insurgency and internationalized civil war). [All this is
why the United States **needs agility**. It not only must be able to
refocus its resources repeatedly; it needs to do this **faster than an
adversary can** focus its own resources]{.underline}.

### Cyber Resilience\-\--2AC

[The absence of formal international agreements on cybersecurity does
not mean there are no rules or boundaries in practice. The rule of
consequences and of self-interest is in play, as is the logic of
cost-benefit in escalation.]{.underline} For example, using cyberspace
to inflict fatalities on foreign citizens or physical damage to key
economic assets is not something APTs would consider lightly. Experts
debate whether such extensive attacks are even possible given current
capabilities (Rid, 2013; Libicki, 2009; Samaan, 2010; Clarke and Knake,
2010). To illustrate: it may be possible to interfere with the operation
of a large dam via cyberspace from abroad, but destroying the concrete
structure and drowning a city down river is quite another matter. To be
sure, President Barack Obama is on record warning hostile players that
cyberattacks are not isolated from the rest of defence policy and
national security. In 2011, he used the loaded term "all necessary
means" to describe the possible American reaction should the nature of
the attack so warrant (U.S. White House, 2011: 14). Interestingly,
Russian military officials have argued that "the use of information
warfare against Russia or its armed forces will categorically not be
considered a non-military phase of a conflict, whether there were
casualties or not" (Hildreth, 2001: 11). [If deterrence is what kept the
peace during the Cold War and the]{.underline} Nuclear Age,
[**[resilience may be the governing principle of the Digital
Age.]{.mark}** Deterrence]{.underline}, after all, works best when your
adversaries have a clear idea of what you can and will do if attacked
(Betts, 2013). Yet, [[in cyberwarfare, **secrecy is paramount** in
maintaining a competitive edge]{.underline}. [Defining what weapons you
will retaliate with when attacked invariably reveals part of your
capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark}. Having an effective deterrent in
cyberspace is thus problematic. The apparent attack by the North Korean
government under the name of "Guardians of Peace" against the Sony
Corporation in late 2014 seems to have set off a US reaction. The wiper
malware used against Sony wreaked havoc on the company and brought to a
halt its imminent release of the satirical movie about Kim Jong-un
called "The Interview". A few days later, North Korea's admittedly small
Internet went dark for a period of time. Possibly, Obama made good on
his threat that North Korea's "cyber vandalism" would be met with "a
proportional response" (Perlroth and Sanger, 2014, December 22). In
short, the operational concept best suited for cybersecurity per se is
resilience. [[**Resilience** is quite different from deterrence, since
resilience presupposes weathering an attack]{.mark}, while the aim of
deterrence is to prevent an attack through the avowal of overwhelming
retaliation.]{.underline} Moreover, given that the nature of
cyberattacks is still evolving and that attackers increasingly use third
and fourth parties to channel their attacks, and thus create false leads
for those trying to find the attacker (Geers, 2010), **[[traditional
notions of deterrence may not apply in
cyberspace]{.underline}]{.mark}**. A [better defence is the **ability to
sustain one or more cyberattacks** and to be able to counter and restore
defensive capacity]{.underline} (Lindsay, 2013). [[How you recover and
how you function when compromised becomes of utmost
importance]{.underline}. **[This appears to be the path NATO has
chosen]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[.]{.underline}** The [alliance regularly
conducts defensive war games,]{.underline} such as Baltic Cyber Shield
and Locked Shields, in cyberspace. In 2013, NATO defence ministers
agreed to establish Rapid Reaction Teams to provide better protection
for NATO's networks (NATO, 2014a). In 2014, the alliance declared
cyberdefence "part of NATO's core task of collective defence" and noted
that cyberattacks could lead to invocation of Article 5 of the North
Atlantic Treaty, NATO's all-for-one collective defence commitment, which
has been the foundation of Western deterrence since 1949 (NATO, 2014b:
§72). Still, NATO's 2011 policy on cybersecurity focuses on "prevention,
resilience and defence of critical cyber assets to NATO and Allies"
(NATO, 2011: 1).

#### Innovation fosters resilience \-\-\-- it's the only internal link to long-term stability 

**Cushing '14** \[Seychelle; November 28; M.A. Political Science from
Simon Fraser University; "Leveraging Information as Power: America's
Pursuit of Cyber Security," <http://summit.sfu.ca/item/14703>\]

Adversaries study America's cyber tool and techniques "to capitalize on
\[US...\] ideas" for their own strategic advantage.89 On the one hand,
[[innovating]{.underline}]{.mark} on its own code [[allows]{.mark}
America to continue executing its [security objectives in
cyberspace]{.mark}]{.underline}. On the other hand, [[innovation allows
the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [to speculate on how]{.mark}
variations in [its attack code may]{.mark} evolve to help **[anticipate
potential attacks]{.mark}** from its adversaries]{.underline}. While the
United States may not be able to close all of its potential
vulnerabilities,90 [it can at least flag the unpatched vulnerabilities
most likely exploited in a cyber strike]{.underline}. Red-teaming cyber
games further allow the US to test both anticipated attacks and
potential responses to maintain an informational advantage.91 [[Cyber
favours offense over defence given its lax security
architecture]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Sophisticated cyber states]{.mark}
that are [able to innovate first will enjoy a relative
advantag]{.mark}e.]{.underline}92 Amassing an arsenal of undetected
vulnerabilities does not necessarily produce an immediate, usable
advantage. Instead, these [[vulnerabilities provide important
info]{.mark}rmation [to gauge]{.mark} the strengths and weaknesses of
[America's]{.mark} offensive and defensive
[capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [Finding undetected
vulnerabilities, and **knowing how to exploit
those**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[positions the US to capitalize on the
**offense-defence innovation cycle**]{.mark} [to **preserve a cyber
advantage**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The strike methods of nuclear or
conventional weapons are largely unchanged and can be used to great
effect. [Cyber weapons]{.underline}, in comparison, [only successfully
work once. [**Innovation is required**]{.mark} to not only manage the
"constant pressure to keep up,"93 but [to also **tip the balance of
info**]{.mark}**rmational advantage** [in your
favour]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### Resilience is key 

**Creighton '15** \[Neal Creighton, October 19, 2015, "The New Cyber
Resiliency: Absorption, Containment And Real-Time Offensive,"
<http://www.hstoday.us/columns/critical-issues-in-national-cybersecurity/blog/new-the-new-cyber-resiliency-absorption-containment-and-real-time-offensive/0301a26262ddbebbab4bf5e28dc094ab.html>\]

[Organizations]{.underline} today [are subjected to meticulously scoped,
expertly developed and targeted attacks by nation-states and criminal
groups]{.underline}. [Given how public large-scale data breaches have
become, cybersecurity has become a household term]{.underline}. But
[this new normal means no one rests easy]{.underline}.

Emerging from the shadows of the news coverage of devastating breaches
in retail, government, healthcare and finance, is the need for
government agencies to think about their role and how to better
[withstand a breach that compromises proprietary information
and]{.underline} could threaten critical infrastructure.

Organizations---particularly their enterprise security teams---are
working tirelessly to keep attackers out, to mitigate the damage
perpetrators cause and to innovate for the future. Cybersecurity has
become a new battlefield with an endless number of attacks ahead.

Like a real battlefield, where adversaries are using all types of
weapons, [hackers are also using innovation to develop new attack
methods and even build new variants of tried and true
methods]{.underline} like SQL injection attacks. [The threat landscape
that organizations]{.underline} [have to deal with is
**all-encompassing** and **evolving
consistently**]{.underline}\--[malware-based attacks]{.underline}
(rootkits, ransomware); [zero-day\'s and APT\'s; code injection attacks
and nation-state attacks]{.underline}, who are now attacking
multinationals\--meaning [it's not just espionage]{.underline}.

[In the past, cybersecurity was about **building a bigger wall** to keep
criminals out]{.underline}---[we're no longer living in that world
because the network perimeter has become ubiquitous. A new security
mindset is required]{.underline}. **[We have to shift to thinking not
"if," but "when," it happens]{.underline}**.

A recent Gartner report, Six Principles of Resilience to Address Digital
Business Risk and Security, underscores the situation at hand and
categorizes a new macro trend as of 2015: the growing capacity and
sophistication of digital adversaries to breach our defenses and cause
major business disruptions in business operations. There should be no
doubts that we need to act now.

Applying a targeted military-style strategy

[Government agencies]{.underline} (and all organizations) [need a
strategy that maps to the tried and tested **military strategy of
resilience**]{.underline} to [defeat the cyberworld's adversaries on
multiple levels]{.underline}. [The primary objective is **protecting the
agency** while **preserving continuity and IP**]{.underline}. [No longer
can you think about winning every cyber battle]{.underline}---[instead,
it's about **proving long-term** that your]{.underline} [organization
doesn't have to succumb to methodical, targeted attacks if **resiliency
sits at the core of the fundamental security strategy**]{.underline}.

National Security Agency Director and Commander of US Cyber Command
Admiral Mike Rogers, helped draw the parallel of how important it is to
focus attention on being more cyber-resilient in the face of emerging
threats last year. As a 30 year-plus veteran of the Navy, he pointed to
the military and says they do not abort their missions in the face of
resistance, but instead they accept they will sustain a certain amount
of collateral damage without laying down their arms.

[The comparison here is how]{.underline}, in the past, and even still
today, [many security and IT teams simply "nuke and]{.underline} [pave"
machines that become infected]{.underline}---essentially taking them
offline and/or wiping them entirely. [This is the equivalent of inviting
more attackers to attack]{.underline}, as [they ultimately have
visibility into machine status if they are]{.underline}
[**sophisticated** and **persistent** enough]{.underline}.

[This outdated process across thousands of infected endpoints starts to
drive costs and resources astronomically]{.underline}. In fact, the
average security organization faces over 17,000 security notifications
today, with typically the ability to only investigate about 700. At that
point, they've already burned 395 incident response man-hours. This
means security incident handling has become an expensive proving ground
for incidents to either go uninvestigated, investigated for too long ...
or for incidents to proliferate as advanced threats.

What it comes down to is **[that attackers got in because current tools
weren't detecting their presence]{.underline}**. Simple.

[**Achieving victory in a battle or a war requires showing resiliency in
the face of fire**, and prevailing despite enduring some level of loss
along the way. The cyber equivalent of this is actually accepting that
an]{.underline} [attacker might penetrate your network, but being able
to rapidly detect their presence and counter their]{.underline}
[techniques with the capability to quarantine the threat to **mitigate
its effectiveness**]{.underline}, ultimately [closing the doors to
**further infiltration**]{.underline}.

### Yes Cyber Escalation\-\--2AC

#### Cyber attacks [escalate]{.underline}\-\--miscalc and misperception, tit for tat retal, and grid collapse ensure it

professor at the School of International and Public Affairs, Columbia
University. He is also a senior fellow with the Cyber Statecraft

<https://warontherocks.com/2022/01/preparing-for-inevitable-cyber-surprise/>
//BY

[Surprise in cyberspace is more important]{.underline} than in other
domains for four reasons. The [dynamics of cyber conflict lend
themselves to surprising uses]{.underline} across all five meanings of
surprise. They rely on [deception and trickery;]{.underline} enable the
unexpected and unforeseen; [are sudden and fast]{.underline}, audacious
and daring; and are especially useful early in a conflict. [There are
also **significant first-use pressures**]{.underline}, as they may
present five ways to increase the danger of a [security
dilemma](https://tnsr.org/2020/09/the-escalation-inversion-and-other-oddities-of-situational-cyber-stability/).
[Because cyber capabilities are not easily observable, it is extremely
difficult to assess an adversary's order of battle or relative strength,
or to detect the equivalent of tanks massing on the border. Any
particular attack might have an **asymmetric impact**, keeping defenders
on **perpetual**
and [exhausting](https://www.securitymagazine.com/articles/96169-hacking-burnout-addressing-stress-among-security-professionals) [**high
alert**](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/02/17/6-strategies-to-reduce-cybersecurity-alert-fatigue-in-your-soc/).]{.underline}

There is also a nearly limitless realm of the possible. Cyber
capabilities can bypass fielded military forces to affect a seemingly
indefinite range of elements within an adversary's society, economy, and
psychology. The pace of innovation and dependence creates countless
paths to attain technical surprise, as does the use of "[existing
weapons and forces in new and different
ways](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/36732393.pdf)." Even more so than
in other kinds of intelligence warning, "[\[t\]here are few limits on
what can be
imagined](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004OA6IO4/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1),"
so defenders have less chance of assessing where a blow may fall.

Further, [economies, societies, and militaries are increasingly
**interconnected** and deeply **cyber-dependent,**]{.underline} so
[cyber capabilities offer an attacker]{.underline} [more opportunities
to]{.underline} **[believe]{.underline}** [that they can shift the
correlation of forces in their favor.]{.underline} [Some experts assert
that "[\[c\]yber attack does not threaten crippling surprise or
existential
risk](https://www.amazon.com/Rethinking-Cybersecurity-Strategy-Effect-Reports/dp/1442280514)]{.underline},"
as past attacks have only disrupted computer components that can be
replaced relatively quickly. **[Yet this misses the scope of potential
future cyber operations.]{.underline}**

[With the "internet of things]{.underline}" [and cyber physical
systems]{.underline}, [attacks can now impact **electrical
grids,**]{.underline} pipelines, and dams, [[objects made of concrete
and
steel]{.underline}](https://eandt.theiet.org/content/articles/2013/12/interview-with-jason-healey/),
[thereby **boosting the potential impact** of and opportunities for
surprise attacks.]{.underline} [The [shift of the Internet as primarily
a communications tool between people to increasingly a control mechanism
for physical
systems](https://www.lauradenardis.com/internet-in-everything)]{.underline} will
[result in]{.underline} operations and [outcomes far outside the
expectations of **academic theories**]{.underline} and government
strategies which can still treat cyber-physical systems as an edge case.

[Even hard targets aren't as hard as they might seem]{.underline}. [Too
difficult to directly hack FireEye or the Department of Justice**? The
Russians got both**]{.underline}, [plus thousands more, by going after
**SolarWinds**]{.underline}.

[States are also not limited to the capabilities that they patiently
build over time,]{.underline} as with more conventional forces. Iran
has [rapidly
expanded](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/18/iran-leapfrogging-our-defenses-in-cyber-war-hacking-expert-mandia-.html) its
capabilities so that Leon Panetta, the then-Secretary of Defense,
told New York Times reporter [Nicole
Perlroth](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0877D6H28/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1) the
Department of Defense "was astounded that Iran could develop"
sophisticated capabilities. Iran's Gulf rivals, such as the United Arab
Emirates, have [used
contractors](https://www.lawfareblog.com/prosecuting-project-raven-new-frontier-export-control-enforcement) for
a turn-key cyber command. States are more likely to deliver offensive
surprises when their reach is not just limited by what they nurture, but
also by what they can buy.

Lastly, [there is high potential for **mistake and
miscalculation**]{.underline}. The [novelty of cyber
attacks]{.underline} [means]{.underline} that adversaries are [more
likely to **misjudge**]{.underline} [how]{.underline} their [operations
will be perceived]{.underline} by the recipient. [The attacker might
believe that its attack is within the norms]{.underline}, **[justified
because it is a tit-for-tat reprisa]{.underline}**l[, or similar to a
past operation that acted as a pressure release]{.underline}, defusing a
crisis. [A rival might]{.underline} shrug off being the target of a
disruptive operation conducted in relative peacetime ("Ah, it's just an
intelligence contest,") only to **[respond aggressively to a lesser
attack in the midst of a crisis]{.underline}** ("This could be the
prelude to a surprise attack!").

[Cyber attacks are likely to]{.underline} flop (or worse, messily
**[cascade]{.underline}**) if they are not backed by meticulous
intelligence, careful planning, and extensive testing --- although these
only reduce, rather than eliminate, the risks. Mistakes can take the
target (and indeed, the attacker) by surprise, as happened with North
Korea and Russia with WannaCry
and [NotPetya](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/russian-military-was-behind-notpetya-cyberattack-in-ukraine-cia-concludes/2018/01/12/048d8506-f7ca-11e7-b34a-b85626af34ef_story.html),
respectively.

Surprise, Russia, and Ukraine

The [Russian]{.underline} buildup in late 2021 for a possible [invasion
of Ukraine highlights]{.underline} the [worrying role of cyber
surprise]{.underline} in geopolitics. Just a year ago, [the
cybersecurity company Mandiant discovered an [extensive Russian
intrusion](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/14/us/politics/russia-hack-nsa-homeland-security-pentagon.html)]{.underline} that
had been propagated through network management software made by
SolarWinds. [Imagine for a moment that this intrusion were still
undiscovered]{.underline} --- [or that the Russians have a
similar]{.underline} but as yet [undiscovered campaign]{.underline},
perhaps built using the [massive log4j
vulnerability](https://warontherocks.com/2022/01/log4j-cyber-threat-requires-new-approach-to-design-flaws/).

Much has been written about the fundamental changes in U.S. cyber
strategy. [U.S. Cyber Command's vision of]{.underline} "[persistent
[engagement]{.underline}](https://www.cybercom.mil/Portals/56/Documents/USCYBERCOM%20Vision%20April%202018.pdf?ver=2018-06-14-152556-010)"
and the Department of Defense's new strategy of "[defend
forward](https://dod.defense.gov/Portals/1/Documents/pubs/2018-National-Defense-Strategy-Summary.pdf)"
have, in particular, [led to numerous [critical
remarks](https://www.thecipherbrief.com/triggering-new-forever-war-cyberspace) about
the **[risks](https://www.lawfareblog.com/what-absent-us-cyber-command-vision) [of](https://www.lawfareblog.com/outcome-based-analysis-us-cyber-strategy-persistence-defend-forward) [escalation](https://medium.com/freeman-spogli-institute-for-international-studies/bytes-bombs-and-spies-261564d51157) **between

These debates are worth continuing, including about what the change in
strategy means
for [establishing](https://www.lawfareblog.com/persistent-engagement-and-tacit-bargaining-path-toward-constructing-norms-cyberspace) [norms](https://www.lawfareblog.com/what-agreed-competition-cyberspace) [in](https://www.lawfareblog.com/there-are-too-many-red-lines-cyberspace) [cyber](https://www.lawfareblog.com/through-persistent-engagement-us-can-influence-agreed-competition)[space](https://www.lawfareblog.com/persistent-engagement-agreed-competition-and-deterrence-cyberspace).
[But]{.underline} commentators have so far ignored a key dimension: The
[strategy's main implication]{.underline}s [may]{.underline} not
[reside]{.underline} [in]{.underline} how it changes the dynamics
between the U.S. and its adversaries but, instead, in [how it affects
broader alliance relationships]{.underline}, especially beyond the Five
Eyes (Australia, Canada, the U.K., the U.S. and New Zealand). U.S. Cyber
Command's [mission to cause friction in adversaries' freedom of maneuver
in cyberspace may end up causing **significant friction in allies' trust
and confidence**---and **adversaries may be able to exploit
that.**]{.underline}

Operating "Seamlessly, Globally, and Continuously"

Cyber Command's new strategy seeks to operate "seamlessly, globally, and
continuously." It states that "\[s\]uperiority through persistence
seizes and maintains the initiative in cyberspace by continuously
engaging and contesting adversaries and causing them uncertainty
wherever they maneuver." According to the strategy document, Cyber
Command intends to do this "as close as possible to adversaries and
their operations," connecting persistent engagement to the Pentagon's
principle of "defending forward."

In an article for [Joint Force
Quarterly](https://ndupress.ndu.edu/JFQ/Joint-Force-Quarterly-92.aspx) (JFQ),
NSA Director and Cyber Command head Gen. Paul Nakasone writes: "We must
instead maneuver seamlessly across the interconnected battlespace,
globally, as close as possible to adversaries and their operations, and
continuously shape the battlespace to create operational advantage for
us while denying the same to our adversaries."

When Nakasone says the U.S. must get "as close as possible to
adversaries and their operations," he implies that the U.S. seeks to
achieve effects that are outside of its own networks and beyond the
networks of its adversaries. This vast area is not ungoverned space. It
includes, for example, routers in Nairobi, servers in Denmark or
operating infrastructure in any other country around the world.

Blue Space, Gray Space and Red Space

In the JFQ article, Nakasone also states that "if we are only defending
in 'blue space' we have failed." This use of terminology as well as talk
about "operating close to the adversary" evades one issue: It is unclear
whether Cyber Command only seeks to cause friction in "red space" or if
it seeks to compete in "gray space" as well. These terms are often
confused and not well-understood. (The terms "gray zone"---areas where
it's unclear whether the government has legal authority to act---and
"gray space" are also frequently confused.) In fact, the issue was
raised for "further exploration" at Cyber Command's 2018
symposium, [specifically](https://www.cybercom.mil/Portals/56/Documents/USCYBERCOM%20Cyberspace%20Strategy%20Symposium%20Proceedings%202018.pdf?ver=2018-07-11-092344-427) understanding
the "relevance of concepts like area of responsibility and red-blue-gray
space to the cyberspace domain."

[Joint Publication
3-12](https://www.jcs.mil/Portals/36/Documents/Doctrine/pubs/jp3_12.pdf?ver=2018-07-16-134954-150) (JP
3-12) on cyberspace operations, prepared under the direction of the
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, explains the terminology:

The term "blue cyberspace" denotes areas in cyberspace protected by the
US, its mission partners, and other areas DOD may be ordered to protect.
Although DOD has standing orders to protect only the Department of
Defense information network (DODIN), cyberspace forces prepare on order,
and when requested by other authorities, to defend or secure other
United States Government (USG) or other cyberspace, as well as
cyberspace related to critical infrastructure and key resources (CI/KR)
of the US and PNs \[partner nations\]. The term "red cyberspace" refers
to those portions of cyberspace owned or controlled by an adversary or
enemy. In this case, "controlled" means more than simply "having a
presence on," since threats may have clandestine access to elements of
global cyberspace where their presence is undetected and without
apparent impact to the operation of the system. Here, controlled means
the ability to direct the operations of a link or node of cyberspace, to
the exclusion of others. All cyberspace that does not meet the
description of either "blue" or "red" is referred to as "gray"
cyberspace.

Gray space is defined based on the nodes adversaries control. This means
the vast area between U.S. government-owned networks and adversaries
is not considered to be gray space. Instead, if for instance the GRU
(Russia's military intelligence agency) controls a node in the
Netherlands, it is considered to be red space based on JP 3-12. And it's
worth mentioning that the notion of control is open to interpretation by
states.

This means that if Cyber Command seeks to operate only in "red space,"
its activities will still have global reach (globally). It also suggests
that red space grows as adversaries expand their operational activity.
Most importantly, this implies that if Cyber Command seeks to achieve
"effects" in gray space, this will involve operating infrastructure that
adversaries do not control---which is to say those systems or networks
on which adversaries merely have a presence or are not active at all.

What's New Under the Sun?

What's really new here? The United States has long operated in networks
"close to the adversary." As Ben Buchanan's book, "[The Cybersecurity
Dilemma](https://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190665012.001.0001/acprof-9780190665012),"
demonstrates, the U.S. has long acted as an "observer" in gray space,
gathering intelligence of adversarial activity in those others'
networks. In fact, information has become public concerning a case in
which the Five Eyes collected intelligence about an espionage platform
(dubbed ["Snowglobe" by the Canadian Intelligence Agency
CSEC](https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/animal-farm-apt-and-the-shadow-of-france-intelligence/#gref) and ["Animal
Farm" by Kaspersky
Lab](https://securelist.com/animals-in-the-apt-farm/69114/)) of an
allied country, France, likely operating in adversarial networks in the
Middle East. In other words, the [practice of fourth-party
collection](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2018/03/07170728/Guerrero-Saade-Raiu-VB2017.pdf) is
nothing new. And the U.S. has also long acted in foreign nonadversarial
networks as a "passerby," transiting through gray space networks to
access an adversarial network.

But the [new]{.underline} Cyber Command and Defense Department
[strategy]{.underline} [changes the nature of the U.S. military's
behavior within]{.underline} those [systems]{.underline} and networks.
Under the new [strategy, Cyber Command wants to be an
active disrupter]{.underline} on those networks. It wants to achieve
effects.

consent]{.underline}**](https://www.lawfareblog.com/title-10-and-title-50-issues-when-computer-network-operations-impact-third-countries)**[,]{.underline}**
**[causing much frustration]{.underline}**.

This will likely lead to a systematic scaling up: Cyber Command now also
seeks to be an active disrupter on those networks "globally,
continuously and seamlessly"---not regionally and sporadically.

The Danger of Operating Seamlessly in Allied Networks

[Operating instantly makes sense considering the potential operational
tempo of adversaries:]{.underline} **[You can't have protracted
diplomatic discussions]{.underline}** **[for two months]{.underline}**
[with an ally about whether or not to take down some command and control
infrastructure of an adversary hosted in the allied
country.]{.underline} [You don't have days, let alone
months]{.underline}. As a participant mentioned at the recent Chatham
House Rule 2019 Cyber Command Symposium on strategy: "Opportunities
within this domain are fleeting."

[Operating seamlessly could]{.underline} also [make sense]{.underline}
**[if an ally does not mind the U.S. coming into its
networks]{.underline}** [to address the malicious activity]{.underline}.
In this vein, **[the U.S. can continue to build partnerships with
countries]{.underline}** that do not have the capacity to defend against
cyber attacks on their own.

But, [what if an allied country is not keen on having the U.S. military
in its networks,]{.underline} actively, seamlessly, and continuously
disrupting an adversary's cyber operations? [As the German case shows,
this scenario will likely come up a lot more in the near
future.]{.underline}

In other words, [in seeking to successfully create friction in
cyberspace for adversaries]{.underline}, [Cyber Command may also seek to
act within allied networks, even if the ally does not
approve]{.underline}. It might even be successful in its mission,
causing friction in adversaries' operations before they cause serious
harm to the U.S. But [this strategy **runs a real risk of undermining
allies' trust** and confidence in ways that are subtle and not easily
observable. This ought not to be overlooked, especially since this
element **may itself be exploited by adversaries.**]{.underline}

[Adversaries **don't randomly choose which intermediate nodes to
direct** their operations through. If **Russia has the choice to go
through a network that would raise some serious diplomatic friction
between the U.S. and a U.S. ally,** or operate through a network that
would cause no diplomatic friction for the U.S**., what would it
prefer**? It would make sense for adversaries to operate through the
networks of exactly those countries with which the U.S. has a strong
relationship but that do not want the U.S. to operate within their
networks causing any effects.]{.underline}

[Russia is **already good at exploiting divisions** between the U.S. and
its allies.]{.underline} Cyber Command's [new strategy might give it
another avenue to do so.]{.underline}

#### [Consolidated OCO norms]{.underline} are key to [democratic governance]{.underline} and the [liberal international order]{.underline}

war: a European strategic vacuum"; February 4, 2022; Taylor and Francis;
<https://doi.org/10.1080/09662839.2022.2031991> //BY

[This article examined how]{.underline} three [European NATO
members]{.underline} -- the Netherlands, France, and Norway -- [perceive
and respond to continuous adversarial cyber operations]{.underline}
short of war. The analysis demonstrated that the Dutch, French, and
Norwegian [decisions to develop offensive military cyber capabilities
date 10--15 years back]{.underline}. In all three countries, [the
development of offensive cyber measures has been portrayed as a timely
investment in necessary capabilities intended to deter and support
military operations in armed conflict]{.underline}. The analysis also
showed that the three countries -- to different degrees and
clarifications -- have acknowledged that the adversarial nature of cyber
operations short of war forms part of the current strategic reality.
Yet, their cyber strategies and military doctrines continue to primarily
centre on warfare and armed conflict.

Thus, [the paper identifies a]{.underline} **[strategic vacuum
as]{.underline}** [none of the]{.underline} three [countries have
formulated **strategic frameworks**]{.underline} [that map onto the
identified strategic reality]{.underline}. The [recent
publications]{.underline} of military cyber doctrines in France and the
Netherlands [provide initial strategic guidance]{.underline} for armed
conflict[, but it remains underspecified how the impact of continuous
cyber conflict]{.underline} short of war [affects the countries' view on
international political competition]{.underline}, [their strategic
positioning, and their military-intelligence relations]{.underline}.
[Questions concerning]{.underline} [when, how, who and to what extent
cyber countermeasures are deployed]{.underline} against hostile cyber
operations short of war [remain ambiguous and secretive]{.underline}.
**[This lack of clarity,]{.underline}** **[strategic
guidance,]{.underline}** and public debate [puts **societies at risk**
and undermines **democratic governance.**]{.underline}

The [insistence on the importance of formulating strategy]{.underline}
and publicly discussing how to deal with cyber conflict short of war
[does not deny that]{.underline} all three [countries are already
engaged in]{.underline} countering [hostile cyber
operations]{.underline} short of war in various ways. [It is rather to
argue that]{.underline} scholars should become more involved in research
on European perspectives on cyber conflict short of war on the one hand,
and [European governments should strive to clarify the strategic
consequences of continuous cyber conflict short of war,]{.underline} on
the other. Both scholars and politicians [need to engage with the
security, political and democratic difficulties related to countering
adversarial cyber hostilities short of war.]{.underline} This is not to
say that European countries should blindly adopt the American strategy
of persistent engagement and defending forward. They should, however,
move beyond the current standstill and design strategic solutions to
prevent, discourage, and respond to continuous cyber incidents short of
war. In conclusion, the paper suggests three avenues for future
scholarly and policy conversation on how European countries can
accomplish this goal and fill this strategic vacuum. These suggestions
are neither exhaustive, a panacea nor an argument for a
one-size-fits-all European strategic approach. Based on the premise of a
changing strategic environment in which cyber conflict short of war
forms a fundamental part of strategic competition, they offer basic
propositions for policy-makers and academics to engage.

First, European countries should define the problem to be solved, "as
ambiguous terminology creates problems for distinguishing between
different conceptions of strategy"
(Hoffman [2019](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09662839.2022.2031991),
p. 133). They would benefit from operationalising cyber conflict short
of war, unpack its core dynamics, and determine its strategic impact. At
a macro-level, this includes elucidating whether cyber conflict short of
war is an expression of fundamental strategic competition? Whether it
taps into the intensified global technological competition, which
includes control of internet infrastructure, power over international
ICT supply chains and markets, global data flows, and innovation in
emerging
technologies?[21](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09662839.2022.2031991) To
what extent, if at all, cyber conflict short of war weakens the position
of European countries in international politics?

At a meso-level, European countries should develop strategically guided
frameworks for counter linked and coordinated cyber operations that
accumulated over time do significant harm to European societies. In
relation to this, European countries should clarify interagency
competencies and processes to handle tensions between military and
intelligence agencies. The analysis showed that inter-agency relations
vary across countries: from a French separation model over a Dutch
cooperation model to a Norwegian unity model. It furthermore
demonstrated that challenges remain in developing operational and legal
frameworks for the deployment of cyber capabilities at the intersection
of the already indistinct and blurring categories of offence and
defence, with consequences for escalation management and strategic
stability
(Buchanan [2016](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09662839.2022.2031991)).
Moreover, when formulating strategies European countries ought to
consider the risk of exacerbating the tension between the stabilising
effects of intelligence collection on international relations and the
destabilising modes of its collection (Goie et
al. [2020](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09662839.2022.2031991)).
At a micro-level, as part of developing such frameworks and interagency
processes, European countries should consider establishing procedures
for classifying and operationalising various forms of malicious cyber
activity and formulating thresholds and trigger points. At all three
levels, these are continuous efforts that are contingent on various
factors counting developments in global politics, digital technologies,
and strategic
culture.[22](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09662839.2022.2031991)

Second, **[national strategy building does not take place in a
vacuum]{.underline}**. [European countries are involved in international
cooperation engaging cyber]{.underline} conflict short of war [in
NATO,]{.underline}[23](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09662839.2022.2031991) EU,[24](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09662839.2022.2031991) and
among the intelligence
services.[25](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09662839.2022.2031991) [National
strategy building should thus take place in conversation with allies and
partners on how to strategise the involvement of military and
intelligence entities in the increased cyber competition short of
war]{.underline}. [The significance]{.underline} of which was recently
[underlined by the 2021 NATO Brussels Summit Communique]{.underline}
([2021](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09662839.2022.2031991),
p. 10) stressing that "allies recognise that the impact of significant
malicious cumulative cyber activities might, in certain circumstances,
be considered as amounting to an armed attack". The development of a new
Strategic Concept for NATO -- to be done in time for the Madrid summit
in June
2022[26](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09662839.2022.2031991) --
provides an excellent opportunity to formalise this conversation and
increase NATO coordination on cyber strategy.

This broad conversation could focus on intelligence versus military
norms and practices for cyberspace (see also Boeke and
Broeders [2018](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09662839.2022.2031991),
Smeets [2020](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09662839.2022.2031991),
Jacobsen [2021](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09662839.2022.2031991)).
It might include discussions on establishing common and transparent
vulnerability equities processes and decreasing the grey market trading
by government agencies purchasing cyber weapon components (Christensen
and
Liebetrau [2019](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09662839.2022.2031991),
Perlroth [2021](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09662839.2022.2031991)),
working on creating a global governance framework for cyber weapons
(Stevens [2018b](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09662839.2022.2031991)),
and enhancing the protection of global supply chain integrity and the
public core of the internet
(Broeders [2017](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09662839.2022.2031991)).
[Moving these discussions forward, European countries could boost
norm-codification and progressive norm-making concerning cyber
competition short of war with the shared goal of **restoring confidence
in a liberal rule-based order** that can prove its relevance and avoid
further poisoning of the global digital well.]{.underline}

Third, [the present lack of **transparent strategic
approaches**]{.underline} [raises concerns about oversight and the
democratic goal of fostering informed]{.underline} political and public
[debate]{.underline}. [It is important to engage]{.underline} society
[in the deliberation on countering cyber]{.underline} conflict short of
war, not least because citizens, private companies, and public
authorities are often the victims of such cyber operations. Ensuring a
continuous debate on the political and military framing of malign cyber
operations and the opportunities to counter them [is vital to democratic
governance]{.underline}. [The current situation thus]{.underline}
**[demands greater transparency]{.underline}** and debate about the
deployment of cyber power -- for all purposes including countering cyber
hostilities short of war -- across society from parliamentary scrutiny
over oversight bodies to the media. The discussion on how to categorise,
react, and respond to cyber hostilities short of war cannot entirely be
left to military or intelligence authorities and experts. While the
exact capabilities and tasks of intelligence and military cyber units
are much likely to remain secret and classified, the increased
acknowledgement of their existence needs to be supplemented with a
targeted effort to increase transparency as well as public and political
debate about their role in defence and foreign policy.

3\. [Clarity NATO's publicly declared policy on cyber threats is
consciously and purposefully vague.2]{.underline}07 Why? **[Strategic
ambiguity has its benefits]{.underline}**. According to the Atlantic
Council panel, [there is no "redline" or "determined threshold" that
would automatically define a cyber act as an act of war.]{.underline}208
[Leaving the rules undefined affords NATO ample room in which to
operate.]{.underline} For a 28-member multinational organization that
operates on the principle of consensus, time and latitude for
solidifying strategic-level decisions are critical. [If NATO publicized
a cyber redline, **it would box the Alliance into a
corner**.]{.underline} [This kind of policy **could embolden cyber
offenders and provoke massive intrusions** that target NATO's networks
at just below this threshold.]{.underline} [Having a defined redline
could also invite nefarious cyber actors to cross it to test NATO's
resolve, damage its reputation as a leader in Euro-Atlantic security,
and undermine the credibility of its Article 5 commitments.]{.underline}
Following the Wales Summit in 2014, NATO affirmed its stance on law and
cyberspace while refusing to address cyber redlines: Our policy also
recognizes that international law, including international humanitarian
law and the UN Charter, applies in cyberspace. Cyber attacks can reach a
threshold that threatens national and Euro-Atlantic prosperity,
security, and stability. Their impact could be as harmful to modern
societies as a conventional attack. We affirm, therefore, that [cyber
defense is part of NATO's core task of collective defense. A decision as
to when a cyber attack would lead to the invocation of Article 5 would
be taken by the North Atlantic Council]{.underline} on a case-by-case
basis.209

At a more strategic level, [OCOs can be used to
**constrain**]{.underline} [or **enhance** the **effects**]{.underline}
[of **other capabilities**]{.underline} [and
**strategies**]{.underline}. Whether they can be used for deterrence,
and whether the concept of deterrence is even meaningful under
conditions of persistent attack, is a matter of controversy. [OCOs have
the advantage that **costs incurred**]{.underline} [or **damage caused**
to an]{.underline} [adversary can be **controlled**]{.underline} [so
that it **falls short**]{.underline} [of the **generally accepted
level**]{.underline} [of an]{.underline} **[armed attack]{.underline}**,
[and can be even **reversible**]{.underline} (Owens et al., 2009). In
his book about the Trump White House, Woodward (2018) comments that
military advisers to the President were reluctant to recommend offensive
cyberattacks against North Korea because they thought the U.S. itself
was too poorly defended to withstand retaliatory cyberattacks, a nascent
example of deterrence in the cyber domain. **[To date]{.underline}**,
**[no direct use]{.underline}** [of **OCO capabilities**]{.underline}
[has resulted in the **outbreak**]{.underline} [of **traditional
conflict**]{.underline}, perhaps [owing to
**uncertainties**]{.underline} [in the **novelty** of the
**attacks**]{.underline}, [the **difficulty** of]{.underline}
**[attribution]{.underline}**, [and the **reluctance** of **national
cyber actors** to **retaliate**]{.underline} [when the **path of
escalation**]{.underline} [is **unclear**]{.underline} (Rid & Buchanan,
2015). [Most importantly]{.underline}, however, [the actions of armed
forces in democratic countries are **constrained**]{.underline} [by the
**rule of law**]{.underline}, [which translates into **multiple
authorities** to **ensure responsible**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[acceptable use]{.underline}**, [and **safeguard against
escalation**]{.underline}. [The **fine-grained control**]{.underline}
[of **OCOs**]{.underline} compared to conventional military force
[provides a way to **manage escalation**]{.underline} [without the
**direct use**]{.underline} [of]{.underline} [physical or military
assets]{.underline}, [whose effect in sparking conflict is **much better
known**]{.underline}. In other words, [instead of reacting to an
**escalating conflict**]{.underline} [by **deploying physical military
assets**]{.underline} [to a region]{.underline}, [an OCO can be
**employed covertly**]{.underline} [to **incur more controllable
costs**]{.underline} [on the adversary]{.underline}, [with the benefit
of **plausible deniability**]{.underline} (Hare, 2018). Depending on the
type of OCO employed, [if there is a reduction in tension]{.underline},
[the **effects** of the OCO can be **reversed** or **scaled
back**]{.underline}.

#### An offensive strategy solves\-\--[effectively deters adversaries]{.underline} by imposing credible costs.

Erica D. Borghard, "Operationalizing Defend Forward: How the Concept
Works to Change Adversary Behavior," Lawfare, March 2020,
https://www.lawfareblog.com/operationalizing-defend-forward-how-concept-works-change-adversary-behavior

Here, I want to focus on the first end state: the theory of victory for
how defend forward can change adversary behavior below the level of
armed attack. [Defend forward hypothesizes the U.S. can **change
adversary behavior**]{.underline} [through **making attacks less
effective**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}, cumulatively, [by
**altering** the **adversary's decision calculus**]{.underline}
[regarding the perceived benefits]{.underline}, [costs and risks of
conducting malicious campaigns against the United States]{.underline}.

[There are **two specific pathways**]{.underline} [that link defend
forward with the desired outcome]{.underline}. [The first is driven
by]{.underline} a logic of **[cost imposition]{.underline}**.
Specifically, [adversary behavior will change when adversaries
experience]{.underline} ([or **perceive**]{.underline}) [an
**increase**]{.underline} [in the]{.underline} direct and indirect
**[costs]{.underline}** [of conducting malicious
activities]{.underline}. [This includes U.S. efforts to **counter
adversaries' offensive cyber capabilities**]{.underline} and
infrastructure, the organizations that support their cyber operations
and campaigns, [and the locus of their decision-making]{.underline}. [In
addition to making it **more difficult**]{.underline} [for adversaries
to conduct malicious operations and campaigns]{.underline}, [this will
**force them**]{.underline} [to **divert resources**]{.underline} [from
other lines of effort]{.underline} [and **shift** to **secondary** and
**tertiary plans**]{.underline}, [and it will]{.underline} also
**[increase]{.underline}** [their **uncertainty**]{.underline} [about
the **likelihood of success**]{.underline}. [The second]{.underline}
pathway stems [from a **bargaining logic**]{.underline}---[to **reduce**
the **information asymmetries**]{.underline} [between the U.S. and its
adversaries]{.underline}. [The idea is to **improve
intelligence**]{.underline} about adversary capabilities, **[provide
early warning]{.underline}** of impending attacks, [and **enable rapid
counter-cyber responses**]{.underline} [and
**information-sharing**]{.underline} with targeted owners and operators,
[while]{.underline} simultaneously **[reducing]{.underline}** [their
**access**]{.underline} [to U.S. information]{.underline}.

**[Together]{.underline}**, **[increasing costs]{.underline}** [to
adversaries]{.underline} [and **improving**]{.underline} [U.S.
**situational awareness**]{.underline} [about **adversary
behavior**]{.underline} [and **capabilities**]{.underline} [can **reduce
information asymmetries**]{.underline} and help the U.S. get "left of
boom," [with the potential to **yield cascading positive
effects**]{.underline}. Additionally, [disrupting adversary
capabilities]{.underline} and infrastructure, in some instances, [may
have an **aggregate effect**]{.underline} [of disrupting
infrastructure]{.underline}, organization and capabilities [that could
have **supported multiple operations**]{.underline} by adversaries.
Moreover, [affecting the adversary's decision-making cycle can
**increase**]{.underline} [the **domestic costs**]{.underline} [for the
adversary's regime]{.underline} if defend forward creates costs for
stakeholders that support the government.

Defend forward has a number of detractors, some with important concerns.
The commission strove to address these, including by providing
recommendations for how the U.S. can improve engagement with
international allies and partners; detailing an enhanced signaling
strategy to mitigate potential risks of inadvertent escalation; and
proposing investments in resilience to shore up the private sector's
ability to withstand and rapidly recover from adverse events. However,
[if we agree that the **current status quo**]{.underline} [in cyberspace
**is not acceptable**]{.underline}, [this raises the
question]{.underline}: [What is a **viable alternative**]{.underline}
[to defend forward to change adversary behavior?]{.underline} Defend
forward seeks to create costs for adversary military organizations and
capabilities and improve U.S. situational awareness---as well as the
situational awareness of U.S. allies and partners---in support of
defensive strategic objectives. [Unlike in the realm of nuclear
deterrence]{.underline}, [in cyberspace **we cannot expect a binary
outcome**]{.underline}---the use of a capability versus nonuse, for
example---[but the U.S. **can** and]{.underline} **[should take
steps]{.underline}** [to **reduce** the **frequency**]{.underline} [and
**magnitude**]{.underline} [of malicious adversary
behavior]{.underline}.

Deterrence-in-kind: developing offensive cyber capabilities

In addition to a declaratory policy, **[developing credible
options]{.underline}** [for **deterrence-in-kind**]{.underline}, [for
example]{.underline}, **[offensive cyber capabilities]{.underline}**,
[will be **key** to **bolstering credibility**]{.underline} of such a
policy [as some actors **will not believe**]{.underline} [the United
States would respond to a cyber attack with anything but cyber
weapons]{.underline}. Peter Singer and Allan Friedman identified this
deterrence-in-kind as well as the prospect of mixed 'cyber- and
real-world retaliatory force' as one avenue to pursue to bolster the
deterrence of cyber attacks.13 [US Cyber Command's ambitious plan to
field over 100 cyber teams by late 2015 is a **positive step** in this
direction]{.underline}.14 [Evidence leaked in August 2013 that the
United States conducted]{.underline} **[231 offensive cyber
operations]{.underline}** [in 2011 also helps **demonstrate advanced

Offensive Weaponry is Required for Credibility and Deterrence

First, [if one wishes to be a **credible actor**]{.underline} both [in
the **military battlefield**]{.underline} [and in **world
politics**]{.underline}, [one **must have offensive
capabilities**]{.underline} -- as one must have defensive capabilities
and the ability to be resilient. [One]{.underline} simply [cannot have a
credible cyber defence without offensive abilities]{.underline}.

Second, [in order to **achieve**]{.underline} and raise her
**[deterrence]{.underline}**, [one **must possess offensive
capabilities**]{.underline}. [The ability to act
offensively]{.underline} [**includes** a **strong preventive message**
to]{.underline} the [others]{.underline} -- [provided that they
**understand it**]{.underline} [and **believe it**]{.underline}.
[Offensive capabilities represent the **key component**]{.underline} [of
**deterrence**]{.underline}.

Third, [offensive thinking and building offensive weaponry are **vital**
in order]{.underline} [to **create** a **strong** and]{.underline}
**[credible defence]{.underline}**. With just "defence thinking" one
will not succeed. One has to have an understanding of how the attacker
acts, and one should try to find all possible vulnerabilities in her own
defence. It is also a matter of developing one's defensive potentials,
testing the current defence and training one's forces. All this becomes
much more efficient if one can test it with her own capabilities.
[Without the ability to act as an attacker]{.underline}, [no country can
build an **effective** and]{.underline} **[credible cyber
defence]{.underline}**.

Fourth, agility and the concept of operations for smart defence are
reality in contemporary warfare for most countries. [One will never
achieve]{.underline} her [objectives by just being
defensive]{.underline} -- [regardless of how defensive her grand
doctrine is]{.underline}. [In some cases]{.underline}, [as it has been
in the past]{.underline}, [attack is the **best defence**]{.underline}.
One cannot stay in bunkers. Instead, [one has to be an **active
defender**]{.underline} [and **snatch** the]{.underline}
**[initiative]{.underline}** [when it is needed]{.underline}. **[Passive
defence alone will not work]{.underline}**. In short, when the lights go
off how does one defend with kinetic weaponry against a nonkinetic
adversary?

#### Biden's splitting CYBERCOM from the NSA now.

Greg **Hadley 3/18**, Congressional editor of Air Force Magazine,

<https://www.airforcemag.com/biden-administration-considers-splitting-nsa-cybercom/>,

[President **Joe Biden's administration** and the **Defense Department**
are looking at the possibility of **splitting up control** of U.S.
**Cyber Com**]{.underline}mand [and the **N**]{.underline}ational
**[S]{.underline}**ecurity **[A]{.underline}**gency, reviving a
long-running debate over how the two organizations are led.

Since the stand-up of CYBERCOM in 2009, its commander has functioned in
a dual-hat role as the director of the NSA, an arrangement meant to help
the new combatant command get off the ground. Gen. Paul M. Nakasone
currently holds both titles.

[For years]{.underline} now, lawmakers, analysts, and **[DOD
officials]{.underline}** have [debated]{.underline} when or even if [to
separate the **two positions**]{.underline}. In December 2020,
then-President Donald Trump's administration delivered a proposal to
split the leadership roles, only for the plan to be rejected as
officials said CYBERCOM had not met the conditions to do so required by
law, according to The Washington Post.

The issue came up again March 17 in a hearing before the House Armed
Services intelligence and special operations subcommittee, as Rep. Don
Bacon (R-Neb.) asked Ronald S. Moultrie, undersecretary of defense for
intelligence and security, for his view on the potential change.

"I would say that from a Department of Defense perspective, we certainly
recognize the value of the dual-hat role that Gen. Nakasone has played
for the last four years and the role of Cyber Command and NSA over the
last 12 years plus," Moultrie said.

"I believe that [the **dual hat** will be looked at again]{.underline},
just [by **this administration**]{.underline}, just [to]{.underline}
ensure that we [understand]{.underline} what the value added is, but
also **[what the impacts are]{.underline}**. And so that discussion is
still ongoing within the department today. We understand that there's a
sentiment on both sides to really not do any harm. But I believe that it
will be looked at. I think it'll be an objective look, and we'll make
sure we reach out to you, sir."

Operations Impact Third Countries,"'
<https://www.lawfareblog.com/title-10-and-title-50-issues-when-computer-network-operations-impact-third-countries>,
cc

Does [Title 10 impose a **legal barrier** on **U.S. Cyber
Com**]{.underline}mand [conducting operations **outside** of the
Pentagon's **own networks**]{.underline}?

That's the question raised earlier this week by this story from Chris
Bing at Cyberscoop (an increasingly interesting site), which builds on
recent congressional testimony from Admiral Rogers. The story depicts a
"quiet but constant tug of war ... between the intelligence community
and the military over the future of government---backed hacking," with
the central issue concerning the allocation of lead responsibility for
conducting computer network operations outside the government's own
systems in order to "strike back at foreign targets." More specifically,
the story depicts something of a turf war between NSA and an
increasingly independent CYBERCOM (highlighting a number of key themes,
including the inherent challenge of balancing intel collection equities
against the interest in having disruptive effect on some targets; on
that point, read all the way to the bottom for spot-on observations from
Jamil Jaffer of George Mason).

Critically, the story suggests that Title 10 and Title 50 concerns also
are impacting this debate. I thought I include a brief note here to shed
light on what that might mean.

The article observes that "\[w\]hen military leaders push to do more
with hackers, they usually meet some form of resistance from Pentagon
lawyers." By way of illustration, the article points to an instance in
which CYBERCOM operators deleted ISIS propaganda off a server that
happened to be located in Germany. The Germans apparently were notified
of the operation in some fashion but not asked for advance consent, and
they were not happy about it.

From a legal perspective, the issue this highlights is that operations
abroad implicate the UN Charter and related claims about international
law protection of sovereignty. So how does this become part of the Title
10/Title 50 debate? Intelligence agencies can more easily act in this
setting when operating under **[Title 50 authority]{.underline}**, as
covert action status [carries with it a **statutory obligation** to
comply with the **U.S. Constitution** and **U.S.
statutes**]{.underline}---but no more than that. **[Title
10]{.underline}**, in contrast, carries [with it **no such** implicit
**statutory shield** against **international law
objections**]{.underline}, and of course there is a general Defense
Department policy of international law compliance. Thus [**CYBERCOM**
operating under Title 10 would run into the **full thicket** of
international law concerns]{.underline}. There may be good and
sufficient answers to those concerns in particular cases---so this
should not be understood as an absolute bar---but it does make sense to
say that [the **legal friction** is **greater** in that setting (that
is, operations with effects on servers in **third
countries**]{.underline} and without consent from those countries) than
it would be for an entity acting under color of Title 50.

#### The distinction between Title 10 and Title 50 is [meaningless]{.underline}.

Andru **Wall 11**, Senior Associate with Alston & Bird LLP; former
senior legal advisor for U.S. Special Operations Command Centra,

Military Operations, Intelligence Activities & Covert Action,"
<https://www.soc.mil/528th/PDFs/Title10Title50.pdf>, cc

Read in concert with Title 10, [Title 50 **does not infringe** upon the
Secretary of Defense]{.underline}'s authorities to collect intelligence.
Rather, Title 50 recognizes the authorities assigned to the Secretary of
Defense under Title 10 over all DoD intelligence activities, and adds
Title 50's provisions regarding Congressional oversight to intelligence
activities conducted primarily by DoD personnel in support of or in
furtherance of tasking from the Director of National Intelligence (DNI)
(as opposed to tasking from the Secretary of Defense).

Thus, [Title 10 and Title 50 are **mutually-reinforcing**]{.underline}
authorities, [not **mutually-exclusive**]{.underline} authorities;
[these statutory authorities may **even** be exercised
**simultaneously**]{.underline} by personnel under the command and
control of the Secretary of Defense. [Labeling some intelligence
activities **"Title 50"** activities while labeling similar activities
**"Title 10"** activities creates a distinction **where the law does
not**]{.underline}. Importantly, the statutes make distinctions based on
direction, control, and funding---not on nomenclature.

**Dunlap 17** Former Major General Charles J. Dunlap, a Duke Law
Professor with a focus on security and civil-military relations after
retiring from the Air Force. \[Let's Temper the Rhetoric About
Civil-Military Relations, Dec 15, 2017,
https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/lets-temper-rhetoric-about-civil-military-relations\]//BPS

[The [military is hardly]{.mark}]{.underline} as
[[homogenous]{.underline}]{.mark} in its views as many narratives would
have you believe. According to a poll from last fall, it is true that
the military in general is more supportive of the commander-in-chief
than the general public, but the officer corps is rather similar to the
public in its opinion of the commander in chief. Furthermore, my bet is
that some critics would be surprised to know that members of the
military (30 percent) label white nationalists as posing a significant
danger, "more than many international hot spots, like Syria (27
percent), Pakistan (25 percent), Afghanistan (22 percent) and Iraq (17
percent)." Regardless, there is nothing inherently evil or
unprofessional about belonging to a political party. Personally, I've
always been a registered independent, but I never questioned someone's
professionalism simply because in their private life chose to identify
with a political party on voter rolls. In fact, one could easily argue
that it is healthy for a democracy when the members of its armed forces
to remain connected in a lawful way to political discourse. Of course,
maintaining the appearance of non-partisanship can be complicated when,
for example, a non-military spouse becomes active in partisan politics,
but that is an issue not confined to the military, but to other
professions in American society (see e.g., here and here). In any event,
nobody should assume that simply because someone has not registered with
a party or, for that matter, voted, that they have no opinion about
political issues, to include partisan ones. Likewise, are we to assume
that simply because someone registers a party membership they will, ipso
facto, be partisan in the execution of their professional duties? That
certainly is not what I've observed, and not just among military
professionals. Judges are only one example of professional who may hold
distinctly partisan views, but who nevertheless regularly set them aside
(hopefully) and conduct themselves impartially in the courtroom and in
their formal opinions. [[Military]{.mark} professionals]{.underline} in
particular are routinely called upon to [**[compartmentalize]{.mark}
their personal [views]{.mark}** [when **performing**]{.mark} **their
official [duties]{.mark}**]{.underline} so as [[to insulate]{.mark}
themselves from inappropriate [decision]{.mark}-making]{.underline}. For
example, Roman Catholics comprise the largest faith group in the
military, but they are required to operate in an environment where key
tenets of their religion\-\--such as opposition to gay marriage and
abortion\-\--cannot be allowed to compromise their official actions.
Additionally, [military [leaders]{.mark}]{.underline} in combat
especially [[must]{.mark} mentally [sequester their]{.mark} personal
[feelings]{.mark}]{.underline}, such as their [[affection
for]{.underline}]{.mark} their [[troops]{.underline}]{.mark} if that
affection [[could compromise]{.mark} the paramount
[responsibility]{.mark} to]{.underline} the security of [the
nation]{.underline} as a whole. This is because the
[warfighting]{.underline} mission [necessitates leaders]{.underline}
sending them into situations where it is inevitable some will be killed
or injured. When leaders find they are not able to handle the
unavoidable sacrifice of their troops in order to protect the country,
the best realize it's time to leave the profession. This is precisely
what happened to then Marine major Nate Fick. As he recorded his reason
for leaving the Marine Corps in his magnificent memoir, One Bullet Away:
The Making of a Marine Officer, Fick said: "Great Marine commanders,
like all great warriors, are able to kill that which they love
most\-\--their men. It's a fundamental law of warfare. Twice I had
cheated it. I couldn't tempt fate again." Setting aside one's political
druthers is a vastly less demanding decision than the one Fick wrestled
with, and most military professionals do so instinctively. An
illustration: I deployed for Operation Desert Fox which was in the midst
of Congressional efforts to impeach Bill Clinton. Despite the
uncertainty of Clinton's future, as well as his unpopularity in the
military, the orders he gave to send servicemembers into harms' way were
obeyed without question (even as some say the operation was concocted to
distract attention from the impeachment scandal). [[Claiming **a
"crisis" in c**]{.mark}ivil-**[m]{.mark}**ilitary
**[r]{.mark}**elations]{.underline} as the title to Matt's essay
suggests [[is **a**]{.mark} **perennial [favorite]{.mark}** [among

Control: The Crisis in Civil-Military Relations. [[The]{.mark}
intellectual [problem?]{.mark} The [crisis **never

[military]{.mark} that [has, despite]{.mark} **all sorts of
[pressures]{.mark}** [through **administrations**]{.mark} **of both
parties**, [remained]{.mark} **dutifully [adherent]{.mark}** [to the

Of course, **[senior military leaders]{.underline}** do not always get
everything they want, but they often [get more than they should. Their
power]{.underline} also extends beyond headline-grabbing decisions about
overseas deployments or troop reductions. The military's influence
[manifests **hundreds of times** a day through **bureaucratic
maneuvers** in]{.underline}side **[the Pentagon]{.underline}**, in
policy discussions in [the **White House**, and]{.underline} during
testimony on [**Capitol Hill**. These **mundane
interactions**]{.underline}, perhaps more than anything else, [steer
decision-making away from civilians]{.underline} in the Office of the
Secretary of Defense and toward uniformed personnel. Inside the
Pentagon, for instance, [**military leaders** often
**preempt**]{.underline} the advice and analysis of [**civilian staff**
by sending their proposals **straight** to the **secretary of
defense**]{.underline}, bypassing the byzantine clearance process that
non-uniformed staffers must navigate.

[There are signs of the **erosion** of **civilian control** outside the
Pentagon]{.underline}, as well. [Congress]{.underline} too [**rarely**
demands that the military bow to **civilian authority**]{.underline},
instead weighing in selectively and for partisan reasons. During the
Obama administration, for example, some commentators and at least one
member of Congress suggested that Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, should resign in protest over the president's
management of the campaign to defeat the Islamic State, also known as
ISIS. The goal was to use Dempsey's role as the president's chief
military adviser as leverage in a partisan battle over Obama's foreign
policy. Under Trump, many Democrats cheered on the retired and
active-duty generals who pushed back against the president's decisions.
These "adults in the room" included James Mattis (the secretary of
defense), John Kelly (the secretary of homeland security and then White
House chief of staff), and H. R. McMaster (Trump's national security
adviser). At the extreme, some of Trump's opponents even urged senior
military leaders to contemplate removing Trump from office. In August
2020, two well-known retired army officers, John Nagl and Paul Yingling,
penned an open letter to Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, telling him to do just that if the president refused to leave
office after losing the 2020 election. Although these
[efforts]{.underline} may have comforted those concerned about Trump's
erratic policies, they [undermined **civilian control** by suggesting
that it was the **military's job** to keep the executive **in check**.
When politicians endorse **military insubordination** that serves their
interests, they do **long-term damage** to]{.underline} the principle of
**[civilian primacy]{.underline}**.

https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/lets-temper-rhetoric-about-civil-military-relations\]//BPS

Let's pose the issue a little differently. [[Are]{.mark} "dire"
[fears]{.mark} about the military]{.underline} profession as a whole
really [[supported by]{.underline}]{.mark} a study that shows that
despite [today's extraordinarily [divisive]{.mark} political
[environment]{.mark}]{.underline}, two-thirds of West Point cadets and
National Defense University colonels had nonetheless not observed or
shared any insulting, rude, [[or disdainful]{.mark} comments about
elected [leaders?]{.mark}]{.underline} The reality is that [however
regrettable such commentary may be, [it]{.mark}'s [occurred]{.mark}
with[in]{.mark}]{.underline} the ranks throughout [our
[history]{.mark}]{.underline} (and [especially during the Revolution and
the Civil War]{.underline})...[yet the Republic has **[no]{.mark}t
suffered ["dire" consequences]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In truth, in a
democracy that treasures free speech, there is a limit to the wisdom of
trying to suppress every untoward remark that someone in uniform might
make about an elected leader. This may be one reason why Article 88 of
the Uniform Code of Military Justice (which criminalizes "contemptuous
language" by officers about certain elected officials) is so limited,
and why the Manual for Courts-Martial counsels that "if not personally
contemptuous, adverse criticism of one of the officials or legislatures
named in the article in the course of a political discussion, even
though emphatically expressed, may not be charged as a violation of the
article." Do we have issues that bear watching about civil-military
relations? Absolutely! As I explained at the Army War College Strategy
conference recently, I believe that technology\-\--particularly social
media, big data, and even neuroscience\-\--could operate to change not
only how military leaders relate to their subordinates and the public,
but also to change society itself. The "civil" of civil-military
relations may evolve into an entity that is markedly different from
today, and this could\-\--and probably will\-\--impact civil-military
relations. But all that is quite different from the perils Matt sees. To
be crystal clear, we certainly do have work to do, but [excitedly
[proclaiming]{.mark}]{.underline} that [we are on [the cusp of "dire
consequences"]{.mark} **unhelpfully [overstates]{.mark}** [and]{.mark},
**even worse, [obfuscates]{.mark} the real
[issues]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In fact, [[over-hyping]{.mark} issues in
**[c]{.mark}**ivil-**[m]{.mark}**ilitary **[r]{.mark}**elations [plays
into partisan politics]{.mark}]{.underline}. How? Consider that
journalist Ross Douthat observed in the New York Times recently that the
US won a great victory over ISIS, but "nobody seemed to notice." Douthat
cites a number of reasons for the lack of attention, but most
interesting is this: But this is also a press failure, a case where the
media is not adequately reporting an important
[[success]{.underline}]{.mark} because it [[does not fit in]{.mark}to
**[the narrative]{.mark} of Trumpian disaster** in [which our
journalist]{.mark}]{.underline}ic entities [are all
[invested]{.mark}]{.underline}. In other words, [[conjuring up]{.mark}
**impending [apocalypse]{.mark}** [in
**c**]{.mark}ivil-**[m]{.mark}**ilitary **[r]{.mark}**elations [can
be]{.mark}come **[another weapon which]{.mark}**]{.underline}, whether
intended or not, may be used by critics invested in the "narrative of
Trumpian disaster" to try to [[delegitimize]{.mark} an area in which
[the Administration]{.mark} has enjoyed]{.underline}, as Douhet points
out, some **[undeniable [success]{.mark}: national
security]{.underline}**. Addressing the perennial challenges of
civil-military relations isn't facilitated when they get wrapped up with
political narratives about specific individuals.

requires]{.underline} a means of gaining access to a particular system
and developing an exploit to cause a desired effect --- and then
maintaining **[persistent (and stealthy) access]{.underline}** to be
able to conduct an offensive operation at the desired time. Moreover,
[the **overall outcome** may be **unpredictable**]{.underline} and net
less-than-desirable results.

Second, [**even if** a state]{.underline} is able to [conduct these
**kinds of operations**, they]{.underline} typically prefer to [do so
**in secret** --- and this mitigates **some escalation concerns**.
That's because, to cause an **escalatory response**]{.underline}, a
state like Russia would have to uncover a cyber operation during a
particular time period --- such as while the Ukraine conflict is
unfolding. For example, Russia [would have to **detect** a **cyber
operation** against a]{.underline} nuclear command and control [system
to cause Putin to perceive a "**window of vulnerability**," perhaps
assessing that it is part of a U.S]{.underline}. or NATO counterforce
[strategy to]{.underline} ~~disable~~ \[[destroy]{.underline}\]
[Russia's ability to **retaliate** with **nuclear
weapons**]{.underline}. But [the **likelihood** of these circumstances
arising is **low** because]{.underline} --- unless a state is trying to
signal with a cyber capability --- [it will try to keep]{.underline}
these kinds of [sensitive operations **secret**]{.underline}. Therefore,
the chances of such an operation being discovered at a particular time
period are relatively small.

Finally, [even if]{.underline}, hypothetically, Russia was to [discover
a cyber operation taking place, the likelihood of]{.underline} it
leading to [escalation is low]{.underline}. This is [due to the
**virtual nature** of **cyber "weapons"** --- they **rarely** cause
destruction]{.underline} in the physical world, let alone permanent
damage. For example, even Russia's 2015 cyber attack against Ukraine's
power grid, an important example of a strategic cyber attack against
civilian critical infrastructure, only resulted in service disruptions
for a few hours. During the current conflict, Russia-linked actors have
so far been stymied in using cyber operations for strategic impact, such
as the failed cyber attack by the group Sandworm against Ukraine's power
grid.

Taken together, this reasoning suggests that, [in practice, cyber
operations]{.underline} may not rise to a level that would cause a state
like Russia to actually fear the integrity of its nuclear command,
control, and communications systems, [creat]{.underline}ing [few reasons
to **escalate** to the level of **nuclear employment**]{.underline}.

[[It is]{.underline}]{.mark} of course [**[highly unlikely]{.mark}**
that [either]{.mark} the **[US]{.mark}**A [or Russia has plans --
or]{.mark} perhaps more importantly, the [desire --
to]{.mark}]{.underline} fully [[undermine]{.mark} the [other's]{.mark}
nuclear **[c]{.mark}**]{.underline}ommand [[and
**c**]{.underline}]{.mark}ontrol [systems]{.underline} as a precursor to
some type of disarming first strike, but the perception that nuclear
forces and associated systems could be vulnerable or compromised is
persuasive. Or as Hayes (2015) puts it, "The risks of cyber disablement
entering into our nuclear forces are real". While [the [growing
possibility]{.mark} of "[cyber]{.mark} disablement" [should **not** be
**overstated** (notions of a]{.mark} "cyber-**[Pearl
Harbor]{.mark}**"]{.underline} (Panetta 2012) [or "cyber
9--11"]{.underline} (Charles 2013) [[have **done little** to help
understand]{.mark} the nature of the challenge]{.underline}),
cyberthreats are nevertheless an increasingly important component of the
contemporary US--Russia strategic context. This is particularly the case
when they are combined with other emerging military-technical
developments and programmes. The net result, especially given the
current downturn in US--Russian strategic relations, and the way cyber
is exacerbating the impact of other problematic strategic dynamics, is
that is seems highly unlikely that either the USA or Russia will make
the requisite moves to de-alert nuclear forces that the new cyber
challenges appear to necessitate, or for that matter to (re)embrace the
"deep nuclear cuts" agenda any time soon.

Assessing the options for arms control and enhancing mutual security

Given the new challenges presented by cyber to both US and Russian
nuclear forces and to US--Russia strategic stability, it is important to
consider what might be done to help mitigate and guard against these
threats, and thereby help minimise the risks of unintentional launches,
miscalculation, and accidents, and perhaps create the conditions for
greater stability, de-alerting, and further nuclear cuts. While there is
unlikely to be a panacea or "magic bullet" that will reduce the risk of
cyberattacks on US and Russian nuclear forces to zero -- be they
designed to launch nuclear weapons or compromise the systems that
support them -- there are a number of options that might be considered
and pursued in order to address these different types of threats and
vulnerabilities. None, of these however, will be easy.

The most obvious and immediate priority for both the USA and Russia is
working (potentially together) to harden and better protect nuclear
systems against possible cyberattack, intrusion, or cyber-induced
accidents. In fact, in October 2013 it was announced that Russian
nuclear command and control networks would be protected against cyber
incursion and attacks by "special units" of the Strategic Missile Forces
(Russia Today 2014). Other measures will include better network defences
and firewalls, more sophisticated cryptographic codes, upgraded and
better protected communications systems (including cables), extra
redundancy, and better training and screening for the practitioners that
operate these systems (see Ullman 2015). However, and while
comprehensive reviews are underway to assess the vulnerabilities of
current US and Russian nuclear systems to cyberattacks, it may well be
that US and Russian C2 infrastructure becomes more vulnerable to cyber
as it is modernised and old analogue systems are replaced with
increasingly hi-tech digital platforms. As a result, and while
[**[nuclear]{.mark}** weapons [and **c**]{.mark}ommand [and
**c**]{.mark}ontrol [infrastructure are]{.mark} likely to be [the **best
protected** of **all**]{.mark} computer systems, [and **"air
gapped"**]{.mark}]{.underline}14 [[from the]{.mark} wider
[Internet]{.mark}]{.underline} -- this does not mean they are
invulnerable or will continue to be secure in the future, particularly
as systems are modernised or become more complex (Fritz 2009). Or as
Peggy Morse, ICBM systems director at Boeing, put it, "while its old
it's very secure" (quoted in Reed 2012).

3\. The terrorist mastermind. A close cousin to the nuclear rogue is the
terrorist mastermind, busily concocting elaborate and highly destructive
plots to bring the world to its knees. People like
[[Osama]{.underline}]{.mark} bin Laden [and]{.underline} Islamic State
leader [Abu]{.underline} Bakr al-Baghdadi have [[made
**extravagant**]{.mark} and **dire [threats]{.mark}**]{.underline}, but
the good news is that [[they]{.mark}'ve [never come close to toppling
a]{.mark} foreign [government, winning millions]{.mark} of followers,
[or threatening]{.mark} our way of [life]{.mark}]{.underline}. I don't
deny that some terrorist groups have devised and executed successful
assaults --- of which the 9/11 attacks were by far the most damaging ---
but a word like "mastermind" conjures up images of Dr. Evil-style
villains who will inevitably outwit our feeble efforts to stop them and
unleash fearsome destruction on an innocent world. In fact, as John
Mueller and others keep reminding us, [**the vast [majority]{.mark}** of
contemporary terrorists [are **incompetent**]{.mark}
**misfits**]{.underline}, and [[even the]{.underline}]{.mark} very
[[best]{.mark} of them **fall well [short of]{.mark} evil
[genius]{.mark}**[. They]{.mark}]{.underline} can and do [[stage
**small**]{.mark}**-scale [attacks]{.mark}** [that cause
**modest**]{.mark} **amounts of [harm]{.mark}**]{.underline}, but
[they]{.underline} have [repeatedly show]{.underline}n
[themselves]{.underline} to be [[**incapable** of **orchestrating
complicated op**]{.mark}**eration[s]{.mark}**]{.underline} that could
actually bring a stable country to its knees. There have been serious
terrorist attacks in Boston; London; Paris; Brussels; Orlando, Florida;
and several other places in recent years, for example --- yet in each
case, these societies proved resilient, and they are thriving again
today. Or just look at New York City, which suffered the worst single
attack ever and has since fully recovered. Terrorism is a problem, the
lives lost to it are an unfortunate tragedy, and those who employ it are
dangerous criminals. [A few terrorists are moderately clever; most are
not. None rises to the level of a "mastermind," and **[none
poses]{.mark} an [existential threat]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Reporters,
pundits, and speechwriters should drop this term from their lexicon,
because this particular animal doesn't exist. Fortunately.

### Democracy D\-\--2AC

#### Democracy solves [nothing]{.underline}.

3 of *Rethinking the Value of Democracy: A Comparative Perspective*,
Stras

[There is]{.underline} actually [**more evidence** for the
idea]{.underline} that the [[liberal norms lead to **more**]{.mark}
**(not less!)** [violence]{.mark}]{.underline}. Bear Braumoeller (1997),
for example, argued that liberal norms of conflict resolution vary
because liberalism takes many forms. By examining survey results from
the newly independent states of the former Soviet Union, he showed that
[[liberalism]{.underline}]{.mark} in that region [[bears]{.mark} a
**stronger [resemblance]{.mark}** [to]{.mark}]{.underline}
nineteenth-century liberal [**[nationalism]{.mark}** than]{.underline}
to the sort of universalist, [Wilsonian liberalism described by
democratic peace theorists]{.underline}. As a result,
[[liberals]{.underline}]{.mark} in the region [[are **more**]{.mark}**,
not less, [aggressive]{.mark}** [than non-liberals]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Carol Fair and her colleagues (Fair et al. 2014) came to similar
conclusions. They conducted surveys in Pakistan (with 6000 respondents)
and found that strong supporters of democratic values are actually not
less but more supportive of militant groups. Moreover, it seems that
[individuals' [attitudes to]{.mark}wards [war]{.mark} are [shaped
by]{.mark} **core [beliefs]{.mark}** [about revenge, which
**vary**]{.mark} **across countries**. [Democracies with]{.mark} a
**strong [tradition]{.mark}**]{.underline} to support ideas [[of
revenge]{.underline}]{.mark}24 [[are]{.mark} **significantly [more
likely]{.mark}** [to initiate conflicts]{.mark}]{.underline} (Stein
2015). [We **cannot state**]{.underline} that [people in democracies are
**not belligerent**]{.underline}. These results challenge the
conventional wisdom about the roots of militancy and the existence of
universal democratic norms, which would encourage peace.

Some scholars have argued that [not the liberal democratic norms, but
**market-oriented development**]{.underline} creates the norms and
values that [explain the democratic peace]{.underline} (see, e.g.,
Mousseau 2000). When opportunities to come to a deal in the market are
widespread, as in market-oriented developed countries, a culture of
contracting emerges that encourages shared respect for individualism,
negotiations, compromise, respect for the law and equality before the
law. Constrained by voters, democratically elected leaders in
market-oriented developed countries abide by these norms. In contrast,
voters in democracies without developed market economies, and the
leaders in nondemocracies, have other norms and values that encourage
conflict.

Hence, [there is]{.underline} not only **[a lack of statistical
studies]{.underline}**, but also [most findings **do not support** the
ideas of the **so-called democratic norms argument**]{.underline}.
Moreover, [it is **not clear** why the pacifist attitude of citizens is
'**only evident** in cases of democratic adversary']{.underline}, while
this is not the case when there are conflicts with nondemocracies,
colonial expansion or third-party interventions (Gates et al. 1996:
5--6). Finally, this kind of [[argument]{.mark} tends to be
[**tautological**, stating]{.mark}]{.underline} that
[['relations]{.mark} between democratic states [are **peaceful
because**]{.mark} they are informed by a **common perception** that
[democracies **are** peaceful']{.mark}]{.underline} (Gates et al. 1996:
5--6).25

[[There are]{.mark} **only [few]{.mark}** statistical [studies]{.mark}
focusing [on]{.mark}]{.underline} this argument of
[[norms]{.underline}]{.mark}. Zeev Maoz and Bruce Russett (1993)
defended this idea and stated that they found evidence, but
[the]{.underline}ir [[measure is]{.mark} **very [weak]{.mark}** [and
**lacks validity**]{.mark}]{.underline}. They employed two measures of
the prevalence of democratic norms. The first is through the concept of
political stability, the persis¬tence of the political system in years.
The second is through the amount of political violence within a state,
which is measured by the number of deaths from political violence and
extent of domestic conflict. In my view, those [[measures do not]{.mark}
**really [measure]{.mark}** \'democratic [norms]{.mark}\' [but]{.mark}
simply \'political [stability]{.mark} and violence\']{.underline}. Other
studies have focused on conflict management as proxy for democratic
norms. William J. Dixon (1994), for example, discovered that democratic
systems are better at conflict management. Democratic opponents are
significandy more likely to reach peaceful settlements than other types
of disputants. In addition, in disputes between democra¬cies, mediation
is more likely to be pursued (Inman et al. 2014; see also Dixon 1993).
Those scholars argued such outcomes supported the dem¬ocratic norms
argument, but eventually they do not directly measure this concept.
Moreover, the existence of democratic norms apparently did not stop the
democracies to go war in the first place. Within this approach of
democratic norms, other scholars stated that greater support for core
liberal values leads to a rejection of destruc¬tive political activities
and reduced support for violent politics. People in democracies are less
aggressive, the argument goes, which could help understand the assumed
existence of democratic peace. Analyses of public opinion surveys showed
that American and British people are somewhat more inclined to use force
against dictatorships than against democracies (Johns and Davies 2012),
but the effect is very small, and it is unclear why this is the case.
[[There is]{.mark} **actually more [evidence]{.mark}**]{.underline} for
the idea [[that]{.underline}]{.mark} the [liberal [norms lead to

### Cyberwar D\-\--2AC

#### Cyberattacks are [bearable]{.underline} AND dwarfed by [squirrel sabotage]{.underline}.

John **Mueller 22**, Adjunct Professor of Political Science, Ohio State
University; Senior Fellow, Cato Institute, 3/22/2022, "The
Cyber-​Delusion," <https://www.cato.org/commentary/cyber-delusion>, cc

This contemporary approach to [cyberthreats]{.underline} resembles the
aftermath of 9/11, when almost all experts believed an even larger
terrorist attack would soon take place. Then, as now, the threat [is
overblown]{.underline}. Although occasionally dramatic, [cyberattacks
have turned out to be a **comparatively minor** and **manageable**
threat. **Far too much** discussion]{.underline} around the issue
[focuses on **worst-​case scenarios**, fails to **contextualize the
problem**, and neglects to **weigh the costs** of **cyberattacks**
against the **enormous value** of the **Internet** and
**a**]{.underline}rtificial **[i]{.underline}**ntelligence. [Most
commentary]{.underline}, moreover, [does not]{.underline} fully
[appreciate the ability of **the business sector**]{.underline}---by far
the most tempting of targets for malevolent hackers---[to develop
**effective countermeasures**]{.underline}.

Cyberwar

If a system is resilient, [even **successful**, **dramatic**, and
**dastardly surprise attacks** can be managed]{.underline}.

Over the past decade, [the **global obsession**]{.underline} with
digital threats has taken various forms, with a particular [focus on
the]{.underline} potential [**military implications** of]{.underline}
emerging **[cyber-​capabilities]{.underline}**. To be sure, the military
needs to worry about keeping its communications and command and control
operations secure from hostile attackers. [Any disruptions, however, are
more likely]{.underline} to be [instrumental]{.underline} or tactical
[than strategic]{.underline}.

Despite statements to the contrary, [the U.S. military **itself** seems
to have recognized **this reality**]{.underline}. When Panetta
proclaimed in 2013 that cyber was "without question, the battlefield for
the future," political scientist Micah Zenko observed at the time that
the Pentagon was spending less than one percent of its budget on
cybersecurity, and an assessment from 2019 suggests it may be more like
one-​tenth of one percent. If those funds prove adequate for the
challenge, it would be something of a bargain.

Cyber also supposedly enhances a state's ability to carry out such
ancient endeavors as espionage, propaganda dissemination, and sabotage.
Analysts have even coined a new term, "hybrid warfare," that usually
includes these three enterprises---although, since the term does not
include direct armed conflict, it might more plausibly be called
"denatured warfare." Cyber's contribution to these three areas, however,
is relatively limited.

Should invading hackers engage in digital espionage against the United
States, for instance, they are likely to find that most of what they
come across is already well known, and that much of the rest is not
worth knowing in the first place. Wikileaks' 2010 publication of
thousands of classified U.S. government documents demonstrated the
degree to which governments worldwide have fallen victim to
over-​classification. When Bill Keller, the editor in charge of poring
over the documents at The New York Times, was asked whether the
reporting team found anything they didn't already know, he responded
"no" without hesitation.

Much the same holds for concerns over the theft of intellectual
property. Not only is this practice centuries old, but systematic
stealing has often proved unwise because it distracts governments from
homegrown innovation. Cyber-​propaganda efforts, in turn, are more likely
to increase the overall amount of available information and
disinformation---an age-​old problem in warfare---than to provide a
decisive advantage.

The achievements of cyber-​sabotage have also been quite modest. The
United States and Israel famously used a computer virus known as Stuxnet
to hamper Iran's progress toward developing a nuclear weapon. Although
observers hailed the operation as a dangerous new development in modern
conflict, the damage proved temporary. Iran quickly rebuilt its
centrifuges, and the attack actually proved counterproductive, as it
encouraged Tehran to accelerate its nuclear program. There have also
been efforts by the United States to physically interfere with missile
development in North Korea. Yet, much like the Iranians, Pyongyang
eventually solved whatever the problem was, and the attacks had little
long-​term effect on their program.

[**Cyber-​alarmists** have also warned about hackers disabling **major
infrastructure** such as **power grids**]{.underline}---potentially
crippling entire countries. [Grids do go down **occasionally**, but the
**culprits** are typically **squirrels and lightning**.
Regardless]{.underline} of the source, [such disruptions
are]{.underline} usually [**brief and bearable**, and engineers are
**increasingly designing** systems that are **resilient** to such
threats]{.underline}. Estonia, for instance, the victim of a major and
oft-​discussed cyberattack in 2007, is now the home of NATO's Cooperative
Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence.

### Cyberterror D\-\--2AC

#### Cyberterrorists are [bums]{.underline}.

John **Mueller 22**, Adjunct Professor of Political Science, Ohio State
University; Senior Fellow, Cato Institute, 3/22/2022, "The
Cyber-​Delusion," <https://www.cato.org/commentary/cyber-delusion>, cc

[Fears that **terrorist groups** could inflict damage through
**cyberspace** have been around for **many years**]{.underline}. And
although cyber played no direct role in the execution of the 9/11
terrorist, the event stirred anxiety about the issue. In 2002, for
instance, The Washington Post published a lengthy front-​page article
conveying the views of "government experts" that "terrorists are at the
threshold of using the Internet as a direct instrument of bloodshed."

To date, [however, **no terrorist group** has launched a **successful
cyberattack**]{.underline}. And [even if it becomes
**possible**]{.underline} for hackers to shed blood, **[shootings and
bombings]{.underline}** are likely to [accomplish the same goal **far
more reliably**]{.underline}. Still, cyber has undoubtedly proved to be
a relatively convenient method for terrorist groups to recruit and
communicate. Rather than creating a paradigm shift, however, this
technique has simply replaced or embellished older methods. [Even
**comparatively** savvy groups such as]{.underline} the
**[I]{.underline}**slamic **[S]{.underline}**tate (also known as ISIS)
tend to [**comically fail** when using the Internet to **stir up
violence**]{.underline} and instruct potential sympathizers. In one
case, an ISIS handler connected his eager American charge to a
prospective collaborator who happened to be an FBI operative.

For the most part, [any **virtual terrorist army**]{.underline} in the
United States [has]{.underline}, as terrorism expert Brian Jenkins puts
it, [remained exactly that: **virtual**]{.underline}. "Talking about
jihad, boasting of what one will do, and offering diabolical schemes
[egging each other on is]{.underline} usually [as far as it
goes]{.underline}," he noted. Indeed, [the **foolish willingness** of
**would-​be terrorists** to describe their aspirations]{.underline} and
often-​childish fantasies on the Internet has [often helped **police**
seeking to **track them down**]{.underline}.

### Cybercrime D\-\--2AC

#### [Resilience measures]{.underline} check cybercrime.

Cyber-​Delusion," <https://www.cato.org/commentary/cyber-delusion>, cc

Despite the overheated rhetoric about war, terrorism, election
interference, and critical infrastructure, [**most cyberattacks** target
the **private sector**]{.underline}, seeking to steal or extort money
from businesses and their customers. [The record here]{.underline},
however, [is **rather encouraging**]{.underline}, and it likely has
broader relevance. [To be sure, cybercriminals have stolen]{.underline}
and extorted [billions]{.underline} of dollars from businesses and
individuals, [but firms have done well at limiting the damage by closing
**software holes**, maintaining **backups**, and safeguarding
**sensitive material**]{.underline}.

[A **central issue** for **potential hackers** is]{.underline} the
**[profitability]{.underline}** of their enterprise. A report by the
cybersecurity firm Symantec estimates that 978 million people were
affected by [cybercrime]{.underline} in 2017, [los]{.underline}ing
[\$172 billion in total. That number]{.underline}---regardless of how
hackers divvy up the profits---[is actually **remarkably small**
compared to losses from **other forms of illegal activity**. Personal
and property crimes in 2017]{.underline}, for instance, [cost Americans
**\$2.6 trillion**]{.underline}.

[Businesses]{.underline} are [also]{.underline} learning to
**[adapt]{.underline}**. Andrew Odlyzko, former head of the University
of Minnesota's Digital Technology Center, points out that [many
firms]{.underline} have realized they can readily [mitigate the **most
damaging effects** of **cybercrime** through]{.underline} minor and
incremental [alterations to their **business practices**.
Banks]{.underline}, for instance, increasingly [require customers to
**verify**]{.underline} large or [suspicious transactions]{.underline}
through voice calls or texts. And even though criminals routinely
capture millions of credit card numbers through compromised databases,
the overall damage is limited and often dominated by the cost of
providing replacement cards. Businesses have also made it easy for
consumers to recover from fraud.

**[Election interference]{.underline}** also [features prominently in
**alarmist discourse** on **cyberthreats**]{.underline}. During the 2016
U.S. presidential election, for instance, the United States highlighted
apparent attempts by Russian hackers to undermine Hillary Clinton's
campaign. Although Clinton still handily won the popular vote, [**many
analysts** argued that]{.underline} digital interlopers sought to
[undermine the **integrity** of **U.S. elections** and]{.underline}
perhaps **[democracy itself]{.underline}**.

[These warnings are exaggerated]{.underline} and---coming from U.S.
policymakers---arguably hypocritical. It is worth noting that the United
States has intervened in foreign elections for decades. Moreover, [the
idea that **elections and voters** are **easily manipulated** is
**suspect**]{.underline}. If extensive promotion could guarantee
success, Americans would all be driving Edsels and drinking New
Coke---legendary marketing failures in 1958 and 1985 by two of the most
successful businesses in history: the Ford Motor Company and Coca-​Cola.
In any capitalist society, people are regularly deluged by advertising
and marketing campaigns. In all cases, those petitioned remain free to
ignore the ads, and most become quite good at it. In fact, studies have
shown that campaign information rarely changes many votes. As political
scientist Diana Mutz points out, the impact of campaign advertising "is
marginal at most."

[Political campaigns]{.underline}, as anyone who has suffered through
one knows, [are also rife with **falsehoods**: incumbents
**strategically distort** their **record**, and challengers do **the
same in reverse**. The 2016 Russian contribution to]{.underline} this
flood of [misinformation was **tiny**. On Facebook, where most of the
manipulation **supposedly** took place, **Moscow's
intervention**]{.underline} [totaled]{.underline} perhaps a fraction
[**one percent** of the content]{.underline} on the platform's news
feed. [Much of this was **also wasted** because the people who embraced
it were **already committed** to a **particular party** or lived in
states that went solidly for one]{.underline} or the other [candidate.
Russia's efforts]{.underline}, moreover, [proved **wildly
counterproductive**]{.underline}. Instead of weakening U.S. policy,
[Moscow generated **bipartisan support** for **anti-​Russian
sanctions**]{.underline} when the two U.S. political parties could agree
on little else.

### 2AC\-\--Resources Infinite

#### CYBERCOM's budget is [ballooning]{.underline} AND the aff is [priced in]{.underline}.

Mark **Pomerleau 3/14**, reporter for DefenseScoop, covering information
warfare and cyberspace, 3/14/2022, "Cyber Command prepares to gain
significant budget control,"
<https://www.fedscoop.com/cyber-command-budget-control-preparations-pom/>,
cc

U.S. **[[Cyber Com]{.underline}]{.mark}**mand [[is preparing to
wield]{.mark} much greater **budget [control]{.mark}** [over
**major**]{.mark} **cyber [programs]{.mark}**]{.underline}, shifting
funds away from the Army and Air Force programs that currently procure
systems on behalf of the command and its forces.

[The fiscal 2022 **N**]{.underline}ational **[D]{.underline}**efense
**[A]{.underline}**uthorization **[A]{.underline}**ct [gave]{.underline}
the commander of [[Cybercom responsibility for]{.mark} **direct
control** and **management** of planning, programming, [budgeting and
execution of]{.mark} the **[resources]{.mark}** to maintain the **cyber
mission force**, an authority [known as **enhanced**]{.mark} **budget
[control]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Previously, the commander only had oversight of about \$600 million from
an overall Department of Defense IT budget of around \$40 billion.

"The individual that runs a combatant [command]{.underline} that's
responsible for defending the nation from significant cyberattack,
defending the Department of Defense information networks and providing
cyber capabilities to the other warfighting \[combatant commands\] ...
he['s got **\$600 million** out of that **topline** \$40 billion to \$50
billion budget]{.underline}," Lt. Gen. Charles Moore, deputy commander
of Cybercom, said during the command's legal conference March 10. "We
have a significant mismatch in terms of the actual money, the
authorities and the responsibility. We're just trying to bring that back
into alignment."

With these new authorities set to take effect in 2024, the command is
now working on its program objective memorandum, or POM, which sets
fiscal plans for future years.

"We're having to build our POM starting in 2024 and, of course,
acquisitions. \[That's a\] big part of what you're going to need, what
your requirements are, how are you going to POM for those types of
activities," Moore said.

In trying to bring the budget back into alignment, Moore said Cyber
Command will focus on a variety of things including headquarters,
subordinate headquarters, the cyber mission force and the elements of
the Joint Cyber Warfighting Architecture (JCWA), which guides the
command's acquisition priorities.

Under this new paradigm, [[funding for **major**]{.mark} **acquisition
[programs]{.mark}**]{.underline} that the services were directing on
behalf of the command [[will **shift to Cybercom**]{.underline}]{.mark},
although the services' program executive offices and program managers
will continue to execute the programs, a spokesperson said.

The elements of the JCWA [include systems for **command and control** of
**cyber forces**]{.underline} and the larger cyber environment, [**big
data**, training and executing **offensive operations**]{.underline},
among others. The Air Force and Army primarily run these programs,
providing the funding and acquisition personnel to deliver them on
behalf of the command.

Under the new model, [**funding for those programs** will **transfer**
to Cyber Com]{.underline}mand.

[[**CYBERCOM** has also had a **pivot**]{.mark} in the **last year**

**[ransomware]{.mark}**]{.underline}, Kennedy said.

"I think about a year and a half ago if you had asked me what
the...responsibility of the Department of Defense in ransomware was,
\[it\] was purely in support of \[the Department of Justice\] and that
activity is primarily a \[law enforcement\] activity," Kennedy said.
"What we're finding, though, in recent times is that [ransomware is a
**national security imperative** as well]{.underline}."

Last year, Gen. Paul Nakasone, head of CYBERCOM and the NSA, said
similarly that views on ransomware has changed, and that [when it
affects "**critical infrastructure**, it's a **national security
issue**."]{.underline}

When it comes to intelligence collecting, Kennedy said
[[partnerships]{.mark}]{.underline} with the FBI and CISA [[have been

### 2AC\-\--T Title 50

#### The distinction between Title 10 and Title 50 is [meaningless]{.underline}.

Andru **Wall 11**, Senior Associate with Alston & Bird LLP; former
senior legal advisor for U.S. Special Operations Command Centra,
12/2/2011, "Demystifying the Title 10-Title 50 Debate: Distinguishing
Military Operations, Intelligence Activities & Covert Action,"
<https://www.soc.mil/528th/PDFs/Title10Title50.pdf>, cc

Read in concert with Title 10, [Title 50 **does not infringe** upon the
Secretary of Defense]{.underline}'s authorities to collect intelligence.
Rather, Title 50 recognizes the authorities assigned to the Secretary of
Defense under Title 10 over all DoD intelligence activities, and adds
Title 50's provisions regarding Congressional oversight to intelligence
activities conducted primarily by DoD personnel in support of or in
furtherance of tasking from the Director of National Intelligence (DNI)
(as opposed to tasking from the Secretary of Defense).

Thus, [[Title 10 and Title 50 are]{.mark}
**mutually-reinforcing**]{.underline} authorities, [[not
**mutually-exclusive**]{.mark}]{.underline} authorities; [[these]{.mark}
statutory authorities [may]{.mark} **even** [be exercised
**simultaneously**]{.mark}]{.underline} by personnel under the command
and control of the Secretary of Defense. [[Labeling]{.mark} some
intelligence [activities **"Title 50"**]{.mark} activities [while
labeling similar]{.mark} activities **["Title 10"]{.mark}** activities
[creates a distinction **where the law does not**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Importantly, the statutes make distinctions based on direction, control,
and funding---not on nomenclature.

<https://www.lawfareblog.com/title-10-and-title-50-issues-when-computer-network-operations-impact-third-countries>,
cc

Does [[Title 10 impose]{.mark} a **legal [barrier]{.mark}** [on **U.S.
Cyber Com**]{.mark}]{.underline}mand [conducting operations **outside**
of the Pentagon's **own networks**]{.underline}?

That's the question raised earlier this week by this story from Chris
Bing at Cyberscoop (an increasingly interesting site), which builds on
recent congressional testimony from Admiral Rogers. The story depicts a
"quiet but constant tug of war ... between the intelligence community
and the military over the future of government---backed hacking," with
the central issue concerning the allocation of lead responsibility for
conducting computer network operations outside the government's own
systems in order to "strike back at foreign targets." More specifically,
the story depicts something of a turf war between NSA and an
increasingly independent CYBERCOM (highlighting a number of key themes,
including the inherent challenge of balancing intel collection equities
against the interest in having disruptive effect on some targets; on
that point, read all the way to the bottom for spot-on observations from
Jamil Jaffer of George Mason).

Critically, the story suggests that Title 10 and Title 50 concerns also
are impacting this debate. I thought I include a brief note here to shed
light on what that might mean.

The article observes that "\[w\]hen military leaders push to do more
with hackers, they usually meet some form of resistance from Pentagon
lawyers." By way of illustration, the article points to an instance in
which CYBERCOM operators deleted ISIS propaganda off a server that
happened to be located in Germany. The Germans apparently were notified
of the operation in some fashion but not asked for advance consent, and
they were not happy about it.

From a legal perspective, the issue this highlights is that operations
abroad implicate the UN Charter and related claims about international
law protection of sovereignty. So how does this become part of the Title
10/Title 50 debate? Intelligence agencies can more easily act in this
setting when operating under **[Title 50 authority]{.underline}**, as
covert action status [carries with it a **statutory obligation** to
comply with the **U.S. Constitution** and **U.S.
statutes**]{.underline}---but no more than that. **[[Title
10]{.underline}]{.mark}**, in contrast, carries [[with it **no**]{.mark}
**such** [implicit **statutory shield** against **international law
objections**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and of course there is a general
Defense Department policy of international law compliance. Thus
[[**CYBERCOM** operating under Title 10 would run into the]{.mark}
**full [thicket]{.mark}** [of international law
concerns]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} There may be good and sufficient
answers to those concerns in particular cases---so this should not be
understood as an absolute bar---but it does make sense to say that [the
**legal friction** is **greater** in that setting (that is, operations
with effects on servers in **third countries**]{.underline} and without
consent from those countries) than it would be for an entity acting
under color of Title 50.

### 2AC\-\--Taiwan D

#### A [confluence]{.underline} of historical evidence and economic factors prove Xi [will not]{.underline} invade Taiwan.

But [[**fears** of a]{.mark}n **imminent [Chinese attack]{.mark}** [are
**misplaced**]{.mark}. For decades, [China's policy]{.mark} toward
Taiwan [has been]{.mark} characterized by **strategic
[patience]{.mark}**]{.underline}, as has its approach to other
territorial claims and disputes---from India to the South China Sea. Far
from spurring China to jettison this approach in favor of an imminent
military assault on Taiwan, [the **war in [Ukraine]{.mark}** [will
reinforce Beijing's]{.mark} commitment to]{.underline} playing [[the
**long game**. The price **Moscow**]{.mark} **has [paid]{.mark}**, both
**militarily** and in]{.underline} the form of [**international
isolation**, [is]{.mark} **but [a fraction]{.mark}** [of what
China]{.mark} could [expect]{.mark}]{.underline} if it were to attempt
to take Taiwan by force. [Better to **wait patiently**]{.underline} for
Taiwan's eventual surrender, [as Beijing sees it, than to]{.underline}
strike now and [risk winning the island at **too high a cost**---or
**losing it forever**]{.underline}.

IMPENDING ATTACK?

Fear that China will attack Taiwan had been growing well before Putin
invaded Ukraine. As Robert Blackwill and Philip Zelikow observed in a
2021 report published by the Council on Foreign Relations, Taiwan is
"becoming the most dangerous flash point in the world for a possible war
that would involve the United States of America, China, and probably
other major powers." In addition to its historical and economic motives
for controlling Taiwan, Beijing feels the need to prevent other powers
from using the island as a base to pressure China militarily or subvert
it politically. For its part, the United States has strong motives for
insisting on what Washington has referred to since 1972 as the "peaceful
resolution of the Taiwan issue"---which, given the anti-unification
sentiments of the Taiwanese people, means an open-ended and perhaps
permanent state of de facto autonomy for the island. Although there is
much emotion on both sides---for China, nationalism; for the United
States, commitment to democracy---what makes the Taiwan issue truly
nonnegotiable are the two countries' security interests.

In 1979, when the United States broke diplomatic relations with Taiwan
to normalize relations with China, Beijing had a reasonable chance of
winning over Taiwan without using force. Taiwan was diplomatically
isolated, militarily weak, and increasingly economically dependent on
the mainland. China encouraged this dependence by establishing a host of
incentives for Taiwanese enterprises to do business on the mainland, by
purchasing Taiwanese exports, and by sending Chinese tourists to the
island. Beijing also invested in Taiwanese media with the aim of
generating favorable news coverage and held exchanges with leaders of
the anti-independence Kuomintang, or Nationalist Party.

But these efforts proved insufficient to stem the tide against
unification in Taiwanese public opinion and politics. [According to
**opinion polls**, the share of [Taiwanese voters favoring unification
fell from **28**]{.mark} **percent in 1999** [to]{.mark} less than
**[two percent]{.mark} in 2022**]{.underline}. An overwhelming majority
favor "maintaining the status quo," which in the language of Taiwanese
politics means sustaining autonomy without formally declaring
independence. Since 2016, [the **anti-unification
D**]{.underline}emocratic **[P]{.underline}**rogressive
**[P]{.underline}**arty has controlled both the presidency and the
legislature, and it [looks **well positioned** to **win**]{.underline}
the next set of national elections in 2024.

Fears of an imminent Chinese attack are misplaced.

[[These trends]{.underline}]{.mark} have [[prompted]{.underline}]{.mark}
China to adopt [[a]{.mark} **more [threatening posture]{.mark}**
[to]{.mark}ward [Taiwan]{.mark}. Beijing]{.underline} has [**stepped up
measures** to **isolate the island** diplomatically, **slowed
imports**]{.underline} and the tourist trade, [trained the **Chinese
military** to conduct]{.underline} the complicated **[joint
operations]{.underline}** necessary for a cross-strait invasion, [and
conducted **frequent probes** of Taiwan's **air defense**]{.underline}
identification zone. China has also developed what the Pentagon calls
"anti-access/area denial" capabilities---including long-range precision
missiles, submarine-launched torpedoes, antiship ballistic missiles,
cybertools, and space capabilities---designed to hold at bay a U.S.
defense of Taiwan.

[[These moves]{.underline}]{.mark} have [[fed **speculation** that China
is]{.mark} **building up** [to]{.mark} a **full-scale
[attack]{.mark}**[. In addition to Xi's]{.mark}]{.underline} desire to
secure his [[legacy]{.underline}]{.mark}, [the [shifting]{.mark}
**balance of [power]{.mark}**]{.underline} between China and the United
States [[is]{.mark} **often [cited]{.mark}**]{.underline} by U.S.
analysts [as a **possible motivation** for Xi]{.underline}. The scholars
Michael Beckley and Hal Brands, for instance, have suggested that China
may attack in the near term because it has reached the peak of its
national strength---and China's leaders know it. [[China is looking
at]{.mark} a **period of [decline]{.mark}**]{.underline} caused by a
combination of unsustainable debt, rising labor costs, an aging
population, declining productivity, and a critical water shortage.
Meanwhile, the United States and Taiwan have recently started to
readjust their military postures to counter the asymmetric threat China
poses. The Biden administration is pulling Japan and South Korea
together around a commitment to "stability in the Taiwan Strait," and
Western businesses are gradually moving their production sites out of
China because of rising labor costs, lack of a level playing field in
the Chinese market, and COVID-19 restrictions. As this reorientation
gathers steam, the West's economic incentives to avoid war with China
will diminish. By this logic, Beijing has reason to strike before its
adversaries are ready.

WAITING GAME

[[The facts]{.mark} on which **such forecasts** are based are **not
wrong**, but they [are **incomplete**]{.mark}. A **fuller set of facts**
suggests that China is still pursuing]{.underline} a strategy of
**[strategic patience]{.underline}** when it comes to Taiwan. First,
[[Chinese leaders]{.underline}]{.mark}---rightly or wrongly---[[seem
**confident**]{.mark} that [they can handle their]{.mark} **own
[problems]{.mark}**]{.underline} better than the West can handle its
problems. They don't deny the challenges that Beckley and Brands
highlight, but [they believe the **West** is **in
decline**]{.underline}, hobbled by ill-managed and slow-growing
economies, social divisions, and weak political leaders. However,
Chinese strategists do not seem to believe that China has yet reached a
favorable power balance with the West. As Yan Xuetong, dean of the
Institute of International Relations at Tsinghua University, has argued,
"China's global reach still has its limits. Despite being a major power,
China also thinks of itself as a developing country---and rightly so,
considering that its GDP per capita remains far behind those of advanced
economies."

[[Beijing]{.mark} can **afford to [wait]{.mark}** [for
power]{.mark}]{.underline} in the Western Pacific [to **tip decisively**
in its favor]{.underline}. [[When]{.mark}
[Washington]{.mark}]{.underline} comes to [[understand that the **cost**
of **defending**]{.mark} **Taiwan** [is **beyond it**]{.mark}**s
means**, and **Taiwanese officials** realize that Washington no longer
has the **appetite for a clash**]{.underline} with China, [[Taiwan
will]{.underline}]{.mark} pragmatically [**[negotiate]{.mark} an
arrangement** that Beijing can accept. In the meantime, China needs only
to **deter Taipei**]{.underline} and Washington [from]{.underline}
attempting to lock in formal Taiwanese **[independence]{.underline}**.
[[Beijing's]{.underline}]{.mark} [**shows of [force]{.mark}**
are]{.underline} not precursors of an imminent attack, therefore, but
[measures intended to **[buy]{.mark} [time]{.mark}** [for
history]{.mark} to take its course]{.underline}.

Second, contrary to the common portrayal of China as itching for war,
[[Beijing]{.mark} has [demonstrated]{.mark} **strategic
[patience]{.mark}** [in]{.mark}]{.underline} pursuit of **[its other
goals]{.underline}**. A good example is Beijing's behavior [in [the
**S**]{.mark}]{.underline}outh **[[C]{.underline}]{.mark}**hina
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**ea, where [China]{.underline} has
[built]{.underline} and militarized seven sand [islands]{.underline}
[without **triggering a war**]{.underline} with the United States or
rival territorial claimants. It did so by building only on landforms it
already controlled, claiming all along that it wasn't doing what it was
doing. The rival territorial claimants were too weak to confront China,
while the United States lacked a justification for doing so because it
has no territorial claims where China was building. Beijing restricted
access to but refrained from seizing a landform it contests with the
sole U.S. treaty ally involved in these disputes---the
Philippines---which in any case lacked an appetite to invoke its
alliance with Washington by moving militarily to defend itself.

The conflict in Ukraine is reminding Xi that war is unpredictable and
rule over a resisting population is costly.

[China]{.underline} likewise [changed the]{.underline} strategic
[**status quo** without triggering]{.underline} an [**armed conflict**
over]{.underline} [the **contested [Senkaku
Islands]{.mark}**]{.underline}, known in China as the Diaoyu Islands, by
escalating from an occasional maritime presence in Japanese waters to a
permanent one, supplementing its naval forces with less confrontational
coast guard, maritime militia, and fishing vessels. Beijing followed a
[similar]{.underline} playbook [in the]{.underline} contested [**Ladakh
region** of **[India]{.mark}**]{.underline}[,]{.mark} where Chinese
troops gradually advanced their positions and established a series of
new lines of control with only one confirmed outbreak of shooting that
was quickly contained.

China has invested in ostensibly civilian port projects across the
Indian Ocean and beyond that could serve as foundations for future naval
operations, raising some alarm but no counteraction.
[Beijing]{.underline} has [also used its **economic** and **diplomatic
influence** in Africa, Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, and
Oceania and its **norm-setting power** in **international
institutions**]{.underline} to incentivize governments to align with
China's interests, again generating some alarm but no effective
resistance. Such diplomatic, economic, and military "gray zone tactics"
illustrate that [[China's **strategic behavior** is]{.mark} geared
toward the **[long term]{.mark}** rather than the **short
term**]{.underline}, moving from no presence to sustained presence in a
host of arenas without generating substantial pushback, much less armed
conflict (with the exception of the fighting in Ladakh). [That same
**strategic caution** has]{.underline} so far [been evident in **China's
policy** toward **Taiwan**, where Beijing]{.underline} has [dialed up
tension]{.underline} and deterred a Taiwanese drive for independence
[without]{.underline} precipitating [a **crisis**]{.underline}.

Finally, [the lesson [Xi]{.mark} is]{.underline} likely [drawing from
Putin]{.underline}'s war in Ukraine [is not that **territorial
[aggression]{.mark}** would go **unpunished**]{.underline} militarily by
the West [but that it [would be]{.mark} both [**difficult** and
**costly**]{.mark}]{.underline}. There is no reason to believe that Xi
is surrounded, as Putin seems to be, by yes men who will tell him that a
war over Taiwan can be easily won. Even if he is, however, the grinding
conflict in [Ukraine is reminding him that [**war is unpredictable** and
**rule**]{.mark} over a **resisting population** [is
**costly**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The amphibious operation China would
need to undertake to seize [[Taiwan would be]{.mark} **far more
[difficult]{.mark}**]{.underline} than the land invasion Russia has
carried out in Ukraine. Xi has been reforming the Chinese military's
command structure and ramping up training for such an operation, but
Chinese forces remain untested in actual combat operations. Meanwhile,
[[the **chances**]{.mark} that **[the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
would [intervene]{.mark}**]{.underline} to defend Taiwan [have
**[increased]{.mark}**]{.underline} as anti-Chinese sentiment has risen
in the United States and Europe---and [[after]{.underline}]{.mark} U.S.
President Joe [[Biden remarked last month]{.mark} that [defending Taiwan
is "the **commitment we made**]{.mark}."]{.underline}

First, successfully [[conducting]{.mark} **cyber [operations]{.mark}**
[against]{.mark}]{.underline} strategic targets, like [[nuclear systems,
is **harder** than]{.mark} the [**conventional wisdom** might suggest.
It requires]{.mark}]{.underline} a means of gaining access to a
particular system and developing an exploit to cause a desired effect
--- and then maintaining **[persistent (and [stealthy)
access]{.mark}]{.underline}** to be able to conduct an offensive
operation at the desired time. Moreover, [the **overall outcome** may be
**unpredictable**]{.underline} and net less-than-desirable results.

Second, [**even [if]{.mark}** [a state]{.mark}]{.underline} is able to
[[conduct these]{.mark} **kinds of [operations]{.mark}**[,
they]{.mark}]{.underline} typically prefer to [[do]{.mark} so **[in
secret]{.mark}** --- and [this mitigates]{.mark} **some [escalation
concerns]{.mark}**. That's because, [to cause a]{.mark}n **escalatory
[response]{.mark}**]{.underline}, a state like Russia would have to
uncover a cyber operation during a particular time period --- such as
while the Ukraine conflict is unfolding. For example, Russia [[would
have to **detect**]{.mark} a **cyber [operation]{.mark}** [against
a]{.mark}]{.underline} nuclear command and control [[system]{.mark} to
cause Putin [to perceive a "**window of vulnerability**]{.mark},"
perhaps assessing that it is part of a U.S]{.underline}. or NATO
counterforce [strategy to]{.underline} ~~disable~~
\[[destroy]{.underline}\] [Russia's ability to **retaliate** with
**nuclear weapons**]{.underline}. But [[the **likelihood** of these
circumstances arising is]{.mark} **low** because]{.underline} --- unless
a state is trying to signal with a cyber capability --- [it will try to
keep]{.underline} these kinds of [sensitive operations
**secret**]{.underline}. Therefore, the chances of such an operation
being discovered at a particular time period are relatively small.

Finally, [even if]{.underline}, hypothetically, Russia was to [discover
a cyber operation taking place, the likelihood of]{.underline} it
leading to [escalation is low]{.underline}. This is [due to the
**virtual nature** of **[cyber "weapons"]{.mark}** --- they [**rarely**
cause destruction]{.mark}]{.underline} in the physical world, let alone
permanent damage. For example, even Russia's 2015 cyber attack against
Ukraine's power grid, an important example of a strategic cyber attack
against civilian critical infrastructure, only resulted in service
disruptions for a few hours. During the current conflict, Russia-linked
actors have so far been stymied in using cyber operations for strategic
impact, such as the failed cyber attack by the group Sandworm against
Ukraine's power grid.

Taken together, this reasoning suggests that, [in practice, cyber
operations]{.underline} may not rise to a level that would cause a state
like Russia to actually fear the integrity of its nuclear command,
control, and communications systems, [creat]{.underline}ing [few reasons
to **escalate** to the level of **nuclear employment**]{.underline}.

### 1AR\-\--NC3 D

#### NC3s are [disconnected]{.underline} from the Internet.

University of Leicester; "War Games Redux? Cyberthreats, US--Russian
Strategic Stability, and New Challenges for Nuclear Security and Arms
Control," European Security 25(2), p. 171-172\]

[[It is]{.underline}]{.mark} of course [**[highly unlikely]{.mark}**
that [either]{.mark} the **[US]{.mark}**A [or Russia has plans --
or]{.mark} perhaps more importantly, the [desire --
to]{.mark}]{.underline} fully [[undermine]{.mark} the [other's]{.mark}
nuclear **[c]{.mark}**]{.underline}ommand [[and
**c**]{.underline}]{.mark}ontrol [systems]{.underline} as a precursor to
some type of disarming first strike, but the perception that nuclear
forces and associated systems could be vulnerable or compromised is
persuasive. Or as Hayes (2015) puts it, "The risks of cyber disablement
entering into our nuclear forces are real". While [the [growing
possibility]{.mark} of "[cyber]{.mark} disablement" [should **not** be
**overstated** (notions of a]{.mark} "cyber-**[Pearl
Harbor]{.mark}**"]{.underline} (Panetta 2012) [or "cyber
9--11"]{.underline} (Charles 2013) [[have **done little** to help
understand]{.mark} the nature of the challenge]{.underline}),
cyberthreats are nevertheless an increasingly important component of the
contemporary US--Russia strategic context. This is particularly the case
when they are combined with other emerging military-technical
developments and programmes. The net result, especially given the
current downturn in US--Russian strategic relations, and the way cyber
is exacerbating the impact of other problematic strategic dynamics, is
that is seems highly unlikely that either the USA or Russia will make
the requisite moves to de-alert nuclear forces that the new cyber
challenges appear to necessitate, or for that matter to (re)embrace the
"deep nuclear cuts" agenda any time soon.

Assessing the options for arms control and enhancing mutual security

Given the new challenges presented by cyber to both US and Russian
nuclear forces and to US--Russia strategic stability, it is important to
consider what might be done to help mitigate and guard against these
threats, and thereby help minimise the risks of unintentional launches,
miscalculation, and accidents, and perhaps create the conditions for
greater stability, de-alerting, and further nuclear cuts. While there is
unlikely to be a panacea or "magic bullet" that will reduce the risk of
cyberattacks on US and Russian nuclear forces to zero -- be they
designed to launch nuclear weapons or compromise the systems that
support them -- there are a number of options that might be considered
and pursued in order to address these different types of threats and
vulnerabilities. None, of these however, will be easy.

The most obvious and immediate priority for both the USA and Russia is
working (potentially together) to harden and better protect nuclear
systems against possible cyberattack, intrusion, or cyber-induced
accidents. In fact, in October 2013 it was announced that Russian
nuclear command and control networks would be protected against cyber
incursion and attacks by "special units" of the Strategic Missile Forces
(Russia Today 2014). Other measures will include better network defences
and firewalls, more sophisticated cryptographic codes, upgraded and
better protected communications systems (including cables), extra
redundancy, and better training and screening for the practitioners that
operate these systems (see Ullman 2015). However, and while
comprehensive reviews are underway to assess the vulnerabilities of
current US and Russian nuclear systems to cyberattacks, it may well be
that US and Russian C2 infrastructure becomes more vulnerable to cyber
as it is modernised and old analogue systems are replaced with
increasingly hi-tech digital platforms. As a result, and while
[**[nuclear]{.mark}** weapons [and **c**]{.mark}ommand [and
**c**]{.mark}ontrol [infrastructure are]{.mark} likely to be [the **best
protected** of **all**]{.mark} computer systems, [and **"air
gapped"**]{.mark}]{.underline}14 [[from the]{.mark} wider
[Internet]{.mark}]{.underline} -- this does not mean they are
invulnerable or will continue to be secure in the future, particularly
as systems are modernised or become more complex (Fritz 2009). Or as
Peggy Morse, ICBM systems director at Boeing, put it, "while its old
it's very secure" (quoted in Reed 2012).

### 2AC\-\--Elections D

#### No impact to election hacking.

John **Mueller 22**, Adjunct Professor of Political Science, Ohio State
University; Senior Fellow, Cato Institute, 3/22/2022, "The
Cyber-​Delusion," <https://www.cato.org/commentary/cyber-delusion>, cc

**[[Election interference]{.underline}]{.mark}** also [[features]{.mark}
prominently in **[alarmist discourse]{.mark}** on
**cyberthreats**]{.underline}. During the 2016 U.S. presidential
election, for instance, the United States highlighted apparent attempts
by Russian hackers to undermine Hillary Clinton's campaign. Although
Clinton still handily won the popular vote, [**many analysts** argued
that]{.underline} digital interlopers sought to [undermine the
**integrity** of **U.S. elections** and]{.underline} perhaps
**[democracy itself]{.underline}**.

[These [warnings are exaggerated]{.mark}]{.underline} and---coming from
U.S. policymakers---arguably hypocritical. It is worth noting that the
United States has intervened in foreign elections for decades. Moreover,
[the idea [that]{.mark} **elections and [voters]{.mark}** [are **easily
manipulated** is **sus**]{.mark}**pect**]{.underline}. If extensive
promotion could guarantee success, Americans would all be driving Edsels
and drinking New Coke---legendary marketing failures in 1958 and 1985 by
two of the most successful businesses in history: the Ford Motor Company
and Coca-​Cola. In any capitalist society, people are regularly deluged
by advertising and marketing campaigns. In all cases, those petitioned
remain free to ignore the ads, and most become quite good at it. In
fact, studies have shown that campaign information rarely changes many
votes. As political scientist Diana Mutz points out, the impact of
campaign advertising "is marginal at most."

[Political [campaigns]{.mark}]{.underline}, as anyone who has suffered
through one knows, [[are]{.mark} also [rife with **falsehoods**]{.mark}:
incumbents **strategically distort** their **record**, and challengers
do **the same in reverse**. [The 2016 Russian contribution
to]{.mark}]{.underline} this flood of [[misinformation was
**tiny**]{.mark}. On Facebook, where most of the manipulation
**supposedly** took place, **[Moscow's
intervention]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[totaled]{.underline}]{.mark}
perhaps a fraction [**[one percent]{.mark}** of the content]{.underline}
on the platform's news feed. [[Much of this was **also wasted** because
the people]{.mark} who embraced it [were **already committed**]{.mark}
to a **particular party** or lived in states that went solidly for
one]{.underline} or the other [candidate. Russia's efforts]{.underline},
moreover, [proved **wildly counterproductive**]{.underline}. Instead of
weakening U.S. policy, [Moscow generated **bipartisan support** for
**anti-​Russian sanctions**]{.underline} when the two U.S. political
parties could agree on little else.

### 2AC\-\--Democracy D

#### Democracy solves [nothing]{.underline}.

3 of *Rethinking the Value of Democracy: A Comparative Perspective*,

[There is]{.underline} actually [**more evidence** for the
idea]{.underline} that the [[liberal norms lead to **more**]{.mark}
**(not less!)** [violence]{.mark}]{.underline}. Bear Braumoeller (1997),
for example, argued that liberal norms of conflict resolution vary
because liberalism takes many forms. By examining survey results from
the newly independent states of the former Soviet Union, he showed that
[[liberalism]{.underline}]{.mark} in that region [[bears]{.mark} a
**stronger [resemblance]{.mark}** [to]{.mark}]{.underline}
nineteenth-century liberal [**[nationalism]{.mark}** than]{.underline}
to the sort of universalist, [Wilsonian liberalism described by
democratic peace theorists]{.underline}. As a result,
[[liberals]{.underline}]{.mark} in the region [[are **more**]{.mark}**,
not less, [aggressive]{.mark}** [than non-liberals]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Carol Fair and her colleagues (Fair et al. 2014) came to similar
conclusions. They conducted surveys in Pakistan (with 6000 respondents)
and found that strong supporters of democratic values are actually not
less but more supportive of militant groups. Moreover, it seems that
[individuals' [attitudes to]{.mark}wards [war]{.mark} are [shaped
by]{.mark} **core [beliefs]{.mark}** [about revenge, which
**vary**]{.mark} **across countries**. [Democracies with]{.mark} a
**strong [tradition]{.mark}**]{.underline} to support ideas [[of
revenge]{.underline}]{.mark}24 [[are]{.mark} **significantly [more
likely]{.mark}** [to initiate conflicts]{.mark}]{.underline} (Stein
2015). [We **cannot state**]{.underline} that [people in democracies are
**not belligerent**]{.underline}. These results challenge the
conventional wisdom about the roots of militancy and the existence of
universal democratic norms, which would encourage peace.

Some scholars have argued that [not the liberal democratic norms, but
**market-oriented development**]{.underline} creates the norms and
values that [explain the democratic peace]{.underline} (see, e.g.,
Mousseau 2000). When opportunities to come to a deal in the market are
widespread, as in market-oriented developed countries, a culture of
contracting emerges that encourages shared respect for individualism,
negotiations, compromise, respect for the law and equality before the
law. Constrained by voters, democratically elected leaders in
market-oriented developed countries abide by these norms. In contrast,
voters in democracies without developed market economies, and the
leaders in nondemocracies, have other norms and values that encourage
conflict.

Hence, [there is]{.underline} not only **[a lack of statistical
studies]{.underline}**, but also [most findings **do not support** the
ideas of the **so-called democratic norms argument**]{.underline}.
Moreover, [it is **not clear** why the pacifist attitude of citizens is
'**only evident** in cases of democratic adversary']{.underline}, while
this is not the case when there are conflicts with nondemocracies,
colonial expansion or third-party interventions (Gates et al. 1996:
5--6). Finally, this kind of [[argument]{.mark} tends to be
[**tautological**, stating]{.mark}]{.underline} that
[['relations]{.mark} between democratic states [are **peaceful
because**]{.mark} they are informed by a **common perception** that
[democracies **are** peaceful']{.mark}]{.underline} (Gates et al. 1996:
5--6).25

### 1AR\-\--Democracy D

#### Norms are [tautological]{.underline} and [impossible]{.underline} to measure.

Comparative Perspective, Palgrave Macmillan, p. 85-86\]

[[There are]{.mark} **only [few]{.mark}** statistical [studies]{.mark}
focusing [on]{.mark}]{.underline} this argument of
[[norms]{.underline}]{.mark}. Zeev Maoz and Bruce Russett (1993)
defended this idea and stated that they found evidence, but
[the]{.underline}ir [[measure is]{.mark} **very [weak]{.mark}** [and
**lacks validity**]{.mark}]{.underline}. They employed two measures of
the prevalence of democratic norms. The first is through the concept of
political stability, the persis¬tence of the political system in years.
The second is through the amount of political violence within a state,
which is measured by the number of deaths from political violence and
extent of domestic conflict. In my view, those [[measures do not]{.mark}
**really [measure]{.mark}** \'democratic [norms]{.mark}\' [but]{.mark}
simply \'political [stability]{.mark} and violence\']{.underline}. Other
studies have focused on conflict management as proxy for democratic
norms. William J. Dixon (1994), for example, discovered that democratic
systems are better at conflict management. Democratic opponents are
significandy more likely to reach peaceful settlements than other types
of disputants. In addition, in disputes between democra¬cies, mediation
is more likely to be pursued (Inman et al. 2014; see also Dixon 1993).
Those scholars argued such outcomes supported the dem¬ocratic norms
argument, but eventually they do not directly measure this concept.
Moreover, the existence of democratic norms apparently did not stop the
democracies to go war in the first place. Within this approach of
democratic norms, other scholars stated that greater support for core
liberal values leads to a rejection of destruc¬tive political activities
and reduced support for violent politics. People in democracies are less
aggressive, the argument goes, which could help understand the assumed
existence of democratic peace. Analyses of public opinion surveys showed
that American and British people are somewhat more inclined to use force
against dictatorships than against democracies (Johns and Davies 2012),
but the effect is very small, and it is unclear why this is the case.
[[There is]{.mark} **actually more [evidence]{.mark}**]{.underline} for
the idea [[that]{.underline}]{.mark} the [liberal [norms lead to
**more**]{.mark} **(not less!) [violence]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Bear

resolution vary because liberalism takes many forms. By examining survey
results from the newly independ¬ent states of the former Soviet Union,
he showed that liberalism in that region bears a stronger resemblance to
nineteenth-century liberal nation¬alism than to the sort of
universalist, Wilsonian liberalism described by democratic peace
theorists. As a result, liberals in the region are more, not less,
aggressive than non-liberals. Carol Fair and her colleagues (Fair et al.
2014) came to similar conclusions. They conducted surveys in Pakistan
(with 6000 respondents) and found that [strong supporters of democratic
values are]{.underline} actually not less but [more supportive of

attitudes towards war are shaped by core beliefs about revenge, which
vary across countries. [Democracies with a strong tradition to support
