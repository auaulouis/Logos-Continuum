# Subs/Domain Awareness Aff -- BFHR

## Notes 

### General Aff Stuff

#### 1AC Construction

Note \-\-- the 1AC should probably have a deterrence advantage. There
are several options for that. The second advantage could be
mines/cables/accidents. It's up to you how you want to construct the
1AC. Could also just be one long deterrence advantage.

#### Things the plan might include:

Under the banner of "anti-submarine warfare"

Training/War Games over/with AI acquired data

Harmonization of data acquired and organized via AI

Data pooling for AI organization and deciphering

Harmonizing (creating common standards) for AI for submarines \-\--
including safety, weaponization, etc.

#### Plan options:

The United States federal government should substantially increase its
anti-submarine security cooperation with the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization in one or more of the following areas: artificial
intelligence, biotechnology, cybersecurity.

The United States federal government should substantially increase its
maritime domain awareness security cooperation with the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization in one or more of the following areas: artificial
intelligence, biotechnology, cybersecurity.

The United States federal government should substantially increase its
security cooperation with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization,
specifically artificial intelligence enabled maritime domain awareness.

#### Notes for answering cps

Think we have a tricky arg that is essentially a uniformity/data sharing
argument \-\--

1.  the plan is a "formalized agreement" \-\-- that is critical to get
    everyone to agree to say yes.

2.  Standardization of data is key \-\-- labels/organization that is
    uniform makes the data more reliable \-\-- that gets it into and out
    of the AI process quickly.

NATO key \-\-\--

a.  Data pooling

b.  Interoperability

c.  Redundancy

d.  Cohesion (if necessary)

#### Some Things to know

UUVs=Unmanned Underwater vessels

AUVs=Autonomous Underwater vessels

#### To Do:

#### Shout outs

Molly, Will, Joseph, Brandon, Hank, Sam, Adam and Owen did the vast
majority of work on this file. They were awesome! We didn't have much
direction at the start of the research period, and they really helped me
and each other to figure out directions to go with the aff. There is a
LOT of potential with this file, and these students deserve the credit
for being creative and working hard.

**[Dataset Curation A]{.underline}**rtificial
**[I]{.underline}**ntelligence **[and Machine Learning are often
conflated and used interchangeably]{.underline}**. **[Artificial
Intelligence refers a field of computer science interested in creating
machines that can behave with human-like abilities]{.underline}** and
can make decisions based on input data. In contrast, **[Machine
Learning, a subset of the AI filed, refers to computer programs and
algorithms that learn from repeated exposure to many
examples]{.underline}**, often millions, instead of operating based on
explicit rules programmed by humans.4 **[The focus in this article is
on]{.underline}** topics specific to **[ML models and
systems]{.underline}**, which will be **[included as parts in a larger
AI or autonomous system]{.underline}**. For example, **[an ML model
could classify ships from passive sonar data, this model would then feed
information about those ships into an AI system that operates an
Unmanned Underwater Vehicle (UUV)]{.underline}**. **[The AI would make
decisions about how to steer the UUV based on data from the sonar ML
model in addition to information about mission objectives, navigation,
and other data]{.underline}**. **[Machine learning models must train on
large volumes of data to produce accurate predictions]{.underline}**.
**[This data must be collected, labeled, and prepared for processing by
the model. Data curation is a labor- and time-intensive task that is
often viewed as an extra cost on ML projects since it must occur before
any model can be trained, but this process should be seen as an integral
part of ML model success]{.underline}**. Researchers recently found that
one of the most commonly used datasets in computer vision research,
ImageNet, has approximately 6 percent of their images mislabeled 5.
Another dataset, QuickDraw, had 10 percent of images mislabeled. Once
the errors were corrected, model performance on the ImageNet dataset
improved by 6 percent over a model trained on the original, uncorrected,
dataset.5 For academic researchers, where the stakes of an error in a
model are relatively low, this could be called a nuisance. However,
**[ML models deployed on warships face greater consequences than those
in research labs]{.underline}**. A similar error, of 6 percent, in an ML
model to classify warships would be far more consequential. **[The time
and labor costs needed to correctly label data for use in ML model
training needs to be factored into ML projects early]{.underline}**.
**[In order to make the creation of these datasets cost
effective]{.underline}**, **[automatic methods will be required to label
data]{.underline}**, and methods of expert human verification must
ensure quality. Once a large enough dataset has been built up, costs
will decrease. However, new data will still have to be continuously
added to training datasets to ensure up to date examples are present in
the training of models. **[A passive acoustic dataset is much more than
an audio recording]{.underline}**: **[Where and when the data is
collected, along with many other discrete factors, are also important
and should be integrated into the dataset]{.underline}**. Sonar data
collected in one part of the ocean, or during a particular time of year,
could be very different than other parts of the ocean or the same point
in the ocean at a different time of year. Both the types of vessels
encountered and the ocean environment will vary. Researchers at Brigham
Young University demonstrated how **[variations in sound speed profiles
can affect machine learning systems that operate on underwater acoustic
data]{.underline}**. **[They showed the effects of changing
environmental conditions when attempting to classify seabed bottom type
from a moving sound source, with variations in the ability of their ML
model to provide correct classifications by up to 20
percent.]{.underline}**6 **[Collecting data from all possible operating
environments, at various times of the year, and labeling them
appropriately will be critical to building robust datasets from which
accurate ML models can be trained]{.underline}**. **[Metadata, in the
form of environmental conditions, sensor performance, sound propagation,
and more must be incorporated during the data collection process.
Engineers and researchers will be able to analyze metadata to understand
where the data came from and what sensor or environmental conditions
could be underrepresented or completely missing]{.underline}**. **[These
challenges must be overcome in a cost-effective way to build datasets
representative of real world operating environments and
conditions.]{.underline}**

#### FYI on Russian sub capabilities

27\. As a sign of its strategic importance, the submarine modernisation
programme is, to a large degree, protected in the Russian defence
budget. This has begun to pay dividends for its fleet of 62 submarines
(active and reserve; excluding special-mission submarines and submarines
in the development and test phase) (IISS, 2019; see Table 1). The newest
submarines are not the most modern in the world by any means. Their
designs are about 10 to 15 years old. However, they represent a step
change in quality. They are highly capable, approaching near parity with
some Allied submarines. Overall, submarine modernisation is an efficient
investment, as Russian submarines achieve effects disproportionate to
the resources committed (Hicks et al., 2016)

28\. The Delta III and Delta IV class submarines still represent the
backbone of Russia's nuclear at-sea deterrent. The Russian navy is
slowly replacing them with new Borei class submarines, which have much
improved acoustic silencing and propulsion. Three are in service today
out of a planned eight to be fielded by the early 2020s (Connolly and
Boulègue, 2018). However, Russia has faced substantial delays in the
construction of the first three Borei submarines, due to problems
related to the development of the diesel generators and especially the
new Bulava 150-kilotonne nuclear ballistic missile (Connolly and
Boulègue, 2018; Warsaw Institute, 2017).

29\. The stealthy and fast Oscar II class nuclear-powered cruise-missile
submarines are some of the largest submarines ever built. Some of the
Oscar II submarines are being modernised to remain in service for
another 15 to 20 years and will be refitted to carry up to 96 Kalibr
missiles. Russia's nuclear-powered general-purpose submarine fleet has
three different classes in its arsenal: the Victor III, Sierra II, and
Akula classes. Some of the Akula submarines are undergoing modernisation
efforts (Gady, 2015).

30\. The successor for all of Russia's tactical nuclear-powered
submarines is the multi-role Yasen class. Experts judge Yasen submarines
to be extremely quiet, although not as quiet as the US Seawolf or
Virginia classes. They are designed to hold between 32 and 40 Kalibr
missiles. Russia also appears to be seeking to place the hypersonic
Zircon cruise missiles, which are under development, on these submarines
(O'Dwyer, 2019). One Yasen submarine is already in service. A second one
is in the testing phase (known as the Yasen-M or Husky, due to certain
modifications). By 2024, Russia plans to commission five more Yasen
submarines. A key challenge for Russia will be to bring down costs. The
Yasen-M has already cost an estimated USD 1.6 billion (Episkopos, 2019).

31\. The Kilo and Improved Kilo class submarines are Russia's
diesel-electric submarines for anti-submarine duties. The Improved Kilo
class submarines are very stealthy and cheap for the level of
capabilities they deliver. The Lada class submarines were supposed to
replace these two classes. However the programme has run into
significant problems and delays. One big problem appears to be that
Russia faces severe difficulties in designing and manufacturing
air-independent propulsion, a key technology for modern diesel-electric
submarines. A few years ago, it appeared that that the Lada design could
be scrapped in favour of a new Kalina class design, (about which little
is known publicly), but Russia has recently restarted work on two Lada
class submarines and wants to ramp up production (Majumdar, 2016;
Majumdar, 2018b).

32\. Russia has perhaps the most developed seabed-warfare capabilities
worldwide (Allport, 2018). In particular, military leaders in the
Alliance have sounded warnings that Russia could tap or sever commercial
or NATO undersea communication cables. Russia currently possesses
special mission submarines of the Delta III, Delta IV, and Oscar II
classes, although many may be at low readiness levels. These submarines
could, however, serve as motherships for the manned mini-submarines and
submersibles such as the Losharik submarine or the Paltus or
Konsul-class submersibles which can manipulate objects on the seabed, or
for unmanned systems. It is unclear how many of these are actually in
service (Ripley, 2019). Russia's Main Directorate of Deep-Sea Research
aims to increase the number of such mini-submarines able to operate on
the seabed. In July 2019, 14 sailors lost their lives after a fire broke
out on the Losharik. The Russian government has released very few
details about the incident, except that the fire started in the battery
system. Russia is committed to restoring the Losharik (Staalesen, 2019).

33\. Much secrecy surrounds another underwater threat: the Poseidon
unmanned underwater vehicle or torpedo (formerly known as Status 6 or
Kanyon). The Poseidon was 'accidentally' revealed during a television
show a few years ago and now features prominently in President Putin's
speeches (Gao, 2019). Russia claims that Poseidons could carry 100- to
2000-megatonne nuclear warheads for coastal destruction and
contamination. The nuclear warheads would be 'salted' with cobalt for
maximum nuclear contamination. While information is too sparse to
properly judge the accuracy of these claims, it is essential to closely
watch the project.

**[In the]{.underline}** **[immediate]{.underline}**
**[future]{.underline}**, the **[[Russia]{.mark}n military

**[[to]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[build out]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[its]{.underline}** **[[UAV]{.mark} fleet
[capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}**, incorporating and increasing swarm
and 'loyal wingman' abilities that tie together piloted and uncrewed
systems for greater striking range and better situational awareness.
**[Russia's]{.underline}** reconnaissance-fire and
**[reconnaissance-strike contours pose the [greatest challenge to
adversary forces]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[given Russia's continuing
efforts to refine UAV use in practically all major units and
formations]{.underline}**. **[[As]{.underline}]{.mark}** the
**[Russian]{.underline}** long-range **[UCAV]{.underline}**
**[[capabilities]{.mark} will [grow]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[[so will
Russia's ability to deliver strikes]{.mark} against ground and aerial
targets [at greater distances]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
**[[increasing]{.mark} the defence ministry's [combat
reach]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Just as important is the impending
proliferation of Russian combat and ISR drones, giving the Russian
industry access to new markets and new data on their potential use
against US assets and allies.229 The Russian defence ministry will also
continue to experiment with UAV--UGV teaming for more effective
battlefield management. **[In the near term]{.underline}**,
**[the UGV testing space will help define how Russian ground forces
could fight future wars]{.underline}**, and whether such systems can
function effectively with manned formations. This trend is exemplified
by the use of UGVs and UAVs in September 2021 during the Zapad-2021
military exercises, with the Russian military using Uran-9 UGVs for
combat reconnaissance and fire support, Uran-6s for demining operations,
Nerehta UGVs for reconnaissance and fire support, and Platforma-M for
urban combat missions and passing through minefields.230 Specifically,
Uran-9 and Nerehta UGVs were used in the combat formations of combined
arms units. Additionally, the Russian military used Orlan-10 and Forpost
UAVs for ISR and target acquisition missions, while Forpost and Orlan-10
combat versions, together with an Orion UCAV, were used for the first
time in support of ground attacks.231 **[[Russia's ability to
manufacture]{.mark} and test [deep-diving UUV]{.mark}s
[presents]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[one of the [growing challenges
to]{.mark} Western and [NATO forces]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[[as
the]{.mark} defence [ministry]{.mark} [will seek]{.mark} to gain
[better]{.mark} situational [awareness]{.mark} below the
waves]{.underline}**, **[while crafting an [unmanned systems]{.mark}
doctrine that could [challenge Western surface]{.mark} and sub-surface
[assets]{.mark}.]{.underline}** At the same time, the Russian navy is
far from the mass use of such systems, in contrast to the
nearly-ubiquitous aerial drone use. **[If the Russian military succeeds
in designing a multi-domain robotic swarm, it could potentially
[challenge current Western military superiority]{.mark} by forcing NATO
to expend its assets on low-cost Russian robotic systems]{.underline}**.
At the same time, unmanned and autonomous technologies were not used in
a true peer conflict until the Nagorny Karabakh war of 2020. **[Today,
the US, NATO and Russian forces are testing and using their autonomous
technologies against mostly militarily inferior and low-tech
adversaries]{.underline}**. In the future, the **[[Russia]{.mark}n
military [will]{.mark}]{.underline}** continue to
[**[refine]{.underline}** **[its]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[robotics
[tech]{.mark}nologies and will upgrade its proposed plans for
integrating these systems]{.underline}** with manned formations to train
for a conflict against a peer adversary. On 21 May 2021 Russian defence
minister Sergey Shoigu announced that his country had commenced mass
production of military robots with AI that can fight autonomously.232
**[He did not specify which vehicles he was referring to, and the
military expert community debated which of the systems described in this
chapter may have been implied in Shoigu's statement]{.underline}**.233
**[Regardless]{.underline}** **[of which vehicles may eventually fit
Shoigu's definition, this chapter has discussed multiple projects
undertaken by the defence ministry in order to develop technologies that
[could give Russia]{.mark}n forces [a battlefield
advantage]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Should such efforts prove successful,
the **[defence ministry's investments]{.underline}** may
**[result]{.underline}** **[in a force structure that would be better
positioned to engage its adversary]{.underline}** **[via]{.underline}**
a range of **[unmanned and autonomous systems]{.underline}** **[that are
first to the fight]{.underline}**, do not carry a human cost in case of
a failed mission, and can provide a better situational awareness of the
adversary's forces and intentions. These developments are not a foregone
conclusion, given the Russian military industry's ongoing struggles with
key manufacturing components for autonomous systems, such as
microelectronics and engines.234 **[Nonetheless, [Russia's mass
manufacturing]{.mark} of, and experimentation with, different types
of military autonomous systems [signals a]{.mark} readiness to
[change]{.mark} [how it conducts]{.mark} military
[operations]{.mark},]{.underline}** **[with speed, effectiveness,
precision and massed use as the ultimate goals]{.underline}**. To
address these impending changes to military CONOPS, **[the [US
and]{.mark} its [European allies should]{.mark} continue to [experiment
with]{.mark}, and conduct an ongoing analysis of, [robotic
tech]{.mark}nologies [for gaining a]{.mark} key [edge in this]{.mark}
emerging [tech]{.mark}nological [race]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Just as
important in the future will be the ability to develop training against
adversarial capabilities that is part of an objective evaluation
of Russian military robotics CONOPS and TTPs.

land borders with Russia and Belarus.]{.underline}**

Sen. Richard Blumenthal and Rep. Joe Courtney agreed that a

--- **[particularly [in the]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[undersea

in the region [or]{.mark} to [stop a small conflict from growing]{.mark}
into something larger.]{.underline}**

The two Connecticut Democrats spoke Jan. 24 at a virtual event hosted by
submarine builder General Dynamics Electric Boat.

Russian President Vladimir **[[Putin]{.underline}]{.mark}** "**[will
test us in every single place that he can.]{.underline}** He's doing it
right now in Ukraine: **[he [wants to restore]{.mark} the
[hegemony]{.mark} over countries that formerly were part of the Soviet
Union]{.underline}**; **[[bring back Ukraine]{.mark} into Mother
Russia]{.underline}**; conduct a hybrid war of military actions,
cyber-attack and misinformation. **[[And]{.underline}]{.mark}** part of
his **[overall strategy]{.underline}** is **[to bols[ter undersea
warfare]{.mark} and thereby]{.underline}** **[push the]{.underline}**
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates, **[try [to]{.mark}
divide allies]{.underline}**, **[and [create
instability]{.mark}]{.underline}**," Blumenthal said in response to a
question regarding how naval forces could help get Putin to back down in
Ukraine.

"**[[Undersea warfare]{.underline}]{.mark}** --- **[because we're
talking about the Mediterranean, about the Black Sea as potential areas
of tension and conflict]{.underline}** --- [**[is]{.underline}** **[very
much]{.underline}** **[in play]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[even though it
isn't directly involved in the confrontation]{.underline}** in the
Eastern Ukraine area or Crimea or in the northern borders of Ukraine,
which represent perhaps the greatest immediate threat in Belarus, where
Putin is amassing forces right now," he added.

The senator said he agreed with President Joe Biden's statement that
U.S. **[troops]{.underline}** **[should not]{.underline}** **[be
sent]{.underline}** into Ukraine to fight, **[but]{.underline}** he said
**[[strengthening]{.underline}]{.mark}** and bolstering **[[NATO
capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the region **[would be
[important]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[[as]{.mark} well as
[finding]{.mark}]{.underline}** other **[[ways to show
strength]{.underline}]{.mark}** "around the world **[in other areas
[where we go head-to-head with the Russians]{.mark}."]{.underline}**

He added that the U.S. should also focus on economic sanctions against
Russia, including export controls on semiconductors and other
technologies Russia needs to keep its economy going; disconnecting
Russia from the international financial system; supplying more arms to
Ukraine so the country can defend itself; and getting NATO allies,
especially Germany, united in their efforts to respond to Russia.

Though the world's focus has been on Ukraine's border with Russia to the
east and Belarus to the north, **[[Russia]{.mark} announced last week
that it would [hold]{.mark} a series of [large naval drills]{.mark} in
all its geographically dispersed fleets, [upping the ante]{.mark} in its
standoff against the West.]{.underline}**

"The drills are intended to practice navy and air force action to
protect Russian national interests in the world's
**[oceans]{.underline}** and to counter military threats to the Russian
Federation," the defense ministry said, adding that they will start this
month and run through February in the Mediterranean, North Atlantic and
Pacific.

Just the day before that announcement, the U.S. Navy announced its
guided-missile submarine Georgia was in Cyprus for a port call --- an
unusual move, announcing the location of this large submarine loaded to
the gills with conventional missiles, that in recent history has only
been done to send a message to Russia or North Korea.

Courtney, in following up to the same question at the event, said the
Harry S. Truman Carrier Strike Group exercising with NATO forces in the
Mediterranean represented "the most visible sign of presence that the
Navy is exercising out there." **[But, he said, the [submarine
fleet]{.mark} would have an [important]{.mark}, if less visible, [role
in checking Russian aggression]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

Saying that **[Russia's string of exercises would "flood the zone" with
submarines in the North Atlantic]{.underline}**, where Russia's
submarine-heavy Northern Fleet operates, Courtney said: "**[There's no
question that our [undersea fleet is going to be very busy at
thi]{.mark}s very [tense moment]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[and]{.mark}
is definitely going to play a big role [in]{.mark} terms of [making
sure]{.mark} [that]{.mark} whatever possible [conflict]{.mark} may
emerge, that it [does not escalate]{.mark} into something more
serious.]{.underline}**"

One hundred and one years ago, a great power released a new weapon on
the world. They allowed it to sidestep its adversaries' military
advantages and deal them a near-~~crippling~~ blow. Those weapons, the
U**[-boats of the German Empire]{.underline}**, **[used new
technologies]{.underline}** to blockade the British Isles and **[sink
millions of tons of Allied shipping]{.underline}**. Eventually, the
Royal Navy prevailed, but the outcome of that battle was never a
foregone conclusion. It **[took the development of an array of new
antisubmarine technologies]{.underline}** and tactics, as well as a
massive mobilization of resources, that **[enabled the Allies to win
this "First Battle of the Atlantic."]{.underline}**

**[Seventy-six years ago, the Second Battle of the Atlantic
began]{.underline}**. Again, **[German U-boats threatened the
Allie]{.underline}**s, this time with new tactics and technologies based
on experiences in the previous war. The Germans had learned how to
overcome the antisubmarine warfare (ASW) advantages of the Allies, and
only by again bringing new technologies, tactics, and resources to bear
did the Allies prevail.

**[During the Cold War,]{.underline}** our **[ASW forces engaged in a
constant cat-and-mouse game]{.underline}** with the Soviet Union's
submarines. Nuclear power, ballistic and cruise missiles, and quieter
systems empowered Soviet submarines in troubling ways. To respond,
**[the United States and its allies were forced to build greater and
more effective ASW forces]{.underline}** and **[continually refine their
own ASW technologies]{.underline}** **[and doctrine to counter the
Soviets. In the shadow of nuclear deterrence, the stakes of this
competition were as high as could be imagined.]{.underline}** This was
the Third Battle of the Atlantic, and, although it was not a shooting
war, it showed once again that **[a responsive, adaptive, and
forward-deployed ASW force is]{.underline}** **[necessary
to]{.underline}** **[deter aggression against our nation and its
allies]{.underline}**.1

In the early 1990s, the end of the Cold War, the collapse of the Soviet
Union, and commentary such as Francis Fukuyama's landmark essay "The End
of History?" led us to believe that our strategic rivalry with Russia
and our need to stay one step ahead of Russian capabilities had faded.
It has not. **[Once again,]{.underline}** **[an effective, skilled, and
technologically advanced Russian submarine force is challenging
us]{.underline}**. **[Russian submarines are prowling the
Atlantic,]{.underline}** testing **[our defenses,]{.underline}**
**[confronting our command of the seas,]{.underline}** **[and preparing
the complex underwater battlespace]{.underline}** **[to give them an
edge in]{.underline}** **[any future conflict]{.underline}**. Vice
Admiral Clive Johnstone, Royal Navy, the head of NATO's maritime forces,
noted recently that his forces **[report]{.underline}** "**[more
activity from Russian submarines]{.underline}** **[than we've seen since
the days of the Cold Wa]{.underline}**r."2 Some analysts believe that
**[even our underwater infrastructure]{.underline}**---such as oil rigs
and telecommunications cables---**[may be under threat by these new and
advanced forces.]{.underline}** Russian focus, investment, and activity
in the undersea domain are now so unmistakable that even the head of the
Russian Navy, Viktor Chirkov, has admitted that **[Russian submarine
patrols]{.underline}** have **[grown 50 percent since
2013]{.underline}**.3

**[Despite]{.underline}** the **[economic crisis]{.underline}** in
Russia, **[rubles continue to flow into the development of Russian
submarine technology]{.underline}** and the growth of that force. The
father of the modern Russian submarine force, the brilliant and highly
decorated design engineer Igor Spassky, admits **[Russian submarine
forces]{.underline}** **[are expanding and advancing]{.underline}**, and
that **[they will be a key part of the]{.underline}** **[country's
arsenal for the foreseeable future]{.underline}**.4

By 2020, the Russian Black Sea Fleet alone will receive the equivalent
of \$2.4 billion of investment.5 And these are not the submarines we
faced during the Cold War. There may be fewer of them, but **[they
are]{.underline}** **[much stealthier,]{.underline}**
**[carry]{.underline}** **[more devastating weaponry]{.underline}**,
**[and go on more frequent and longer deployments than
before.]{.underline}** The **[submarines]{.underline}** of the Russian
Federation are **[one of the most difficult threats the United States
has faced]{.underline}**. This threat is significant, and it is only
growing in complexity and capacity.

Russia's New Approach

Not only have **[Russia's]{.underline}** actions and capabilities
increased in alarming and confrontational ways, its **[national-security
policy is aimed at challenging the United States and]{.underline}** its
**[NATO]{.underline}** allies and partners. For example, the new Russian
national security-strategy **[depicts]{.underline}** the **[United
States and NATO as threats to Russian security and accuses us of
applying "political, economic, military, and information-related
pressure]{.underline}**" on Russia.6 **[Thus, not only is Russia
pursuing advanced military capabilities]{.underline}** (especially in
the underwater domain) that enable it to be a credible threat to us, it
is now boldly saying that it intends to act as one.

An **[enduring objective of Russian fo]{.underline}**reign
**[po]{.underline}**licy today **[is to challenge NATO]{.underline}**
**[and elevate Russia on the European stage once again]{.underline}**.7
Building on the national strategy, the new **[Russian]{.underline}**
**[maritime doctrine]{.underline}** **[reorients its naval forces in a
calculated and determined way.]{.underline}** By confronting NATO at
will, **[Russia confirms its status as a great power]{.underline}** in
the 21st century. The new maritime doctrine tells us that **[Russia will
counter]{.underline}** our **[existing ASW technologies;]{.underline}**
**[challenge]{.underline}** U.S. and **[NATO's maritime presence in the
Atlantic]{.underline}** as well as the **[Baltic, Black, and
Mediterranean seas]{.underline}**; and **[expand Russian permanent
presence]{.underline}** **[in the Arctic and
Mediterranean.8]{.underline}**

Furthermore, **[Russia is]{.underline}** **[rapidly closing the
technological ga]{.underline}**p with the United States. It has
**[created]{.underline}** an **[advanced military
designed]{.underline}** to **[overcome our advantages]{.underline}** and
**[exploit our weaknesses]{.underline}**---this is the epitome of
asymmetric warfare. **[Nowhere is this more evident]{.underline}**
**[than in the]{.underline}** maritime (and especially
**[underwater]{.underline}**) **[domain]{.underline}**. Russia
**[rapidly]{.underline}** is **[building]{.underline}** and deploying
**[more advanced and significantly quieter attack
submarines]{.underline}** and frigates armed **[with the long-range
Kalibr cruise missile]{.underline}** (including six new Kilo-class
diesel-electric attack submarines destined for the Black Sea).9 Not
coincidentally, **[these are the platforms that are the most challenging
for us to deal with because of their inherent stealth]{.underline}**. As
demonstrated last December by Kalibr launches into Syria from the
Eastern Mediterranean, Russian leaders will use such weapons at will,
without the same qualms we have about collateral damage. **[The clear
advantage that we enjoyed in antisubmarine warfare during the Cold War
is waning]{.underline}**.10 **[Russian submarines are]{.underline}**
**[more capable than before]{.underline}**, and so **[we are again in
a]{.underline}** **[technological arms race with
Russia]{.underline}**.11

**[Russia]{.underline}** is **[claiming maritime battlespace across
Europe]{.underline}** and deplo**[ying forces outside Russian
borde]{.underline}**rs. An interlocking system of Russian coastal
missiles, interceptor aircraft, air-defense systems, surface ships, and
**[submarines]{.underline}** now **[threatens all maritime forces in the
Baltic,]{.underline}** as well as our NATO allies in Lithuania, Estonia,
and Latvia---wh**[o no longer control even their own coastlines unless
Russian leaders allow them to do so.]{.underline}** A similar
anti-access/area-denial (**[A2/AD) "fortress]{.underline}**" was
**[constructed in the Black Sea]{.underline}** after Russian forces
invaded Ukraine and seized Crimea. Russian **[forces deployed to
Syria]{.underline}** are **[growing steadily,]{.underline}** and
**[Russia has constructed military]{.underline}** **[bases in the
Arctic,]{.underline}** **[militarizing and claiming large swaths of
it]{.underline}**, in contravention of customary international law.12 In
this way, **[Russia has]{.underline}** **[blunted our power-projection
capabilities]{.underline}** through A2/AD and extended its influence far
beyond its borders.

Russia now **[employs an "arc of steel" from the Arctic through the
Baltic and down to the Black Sea]{.underline}**.13 Combined with
extensive and frequent submarine patrols throughout the North Atlantic
and Norwegian Sea, and forward-deployed forces in Syria, **[Russia has
the capability to hold nearly all NATO maritime forces at risk. No
longer is the maritime spac]{.underline}**e
**[uncontested]{.underline}**. For the first time in almost 30 years,
**[Russia is a significant and aggressive maritime power.]{.underline}**

In his extensive academic research on naval innovation, Owen R. Cote,
Jr., of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Strategic Studies
Program has long warned of a potential "**[fourth battle" for control of
the undersea domain.14]{.underline}** It is now clear that a fourth
battle is not looming, but **[is]{.underline}** **[being waged
now]{.underline}**, across and underneath the oceans and seas that
border Europe. This is not a kinetic fight. It is a **[struggle between
Russian forces that probe for weakness]{.underline}**, **[and U.S. and
NATO]{.underline}** **[ASW forces that protect and deter]{.underline}**.
Just like in the Cold War, **[the stakes are high.]{.underline}**

Winning the Fourth Battle Today

**[With]{.underline}** our allies and partners in **[NATO]{.underline}**
and across the globe**[, we present a broad and united]{.underline}**
**[front against any]{.underline}** **[potential Russian
threats]{.underline}**. Our maritime partnerships yield a **[global
network of navies that together form the greatest maritime force for
peace]{.underline}** ever known. NATO exercises demonstrate our unity
superbly. For example, on 7 June 2015, 17 nations, with 49 ships, more
than 60 aircraft, and a vast array of ground forces, demonstrated their
abilities to operate together to defend the Baltic region in BALTOPS.
This exercise, in its 43rd year, made it clear that the United States,
NATO, and partner nations have an unwavering commitment to protect
themselves by acting in concert. Similarly, Sea Breeze 2015 **[sent a
clear signal to Russia that the United States]{.underline}** and its
allies **[will not back down in the Black Sea]{.underline}** region.
**[Eighteen ships from 11 nations (Bulgaria, Germany, Greece, Italy,
Moldova, Romania, Sweden, Turkey, Ukraine, the United
Kingdom]{.underline}**, and the United States) **[demonstrated the will
and ability to operate together]{.underline}** to achieve maritime
security and **[conduct air defense and antisubmarine warfare in the
Black Sea.]{.underline}**

A variety of policy and resource shifts have been enacted that signal
our resolve to Russia. For example, the U.S. Navy's revised Cooperative
Strategy for 21st Century Seapower notes the critical importance of
all-domain access and deterrence. The Chief of Naval Operations' recent
Design for Maintaining Maritime Superiority puts the Navy on a clear
path to adapt to the new global security environment.15 But we must act
now to implement such guidance before Russia provokes again. To do so,
we must engage and conduct operations forward more deliberately, more
strategically, and with more forethought---and in ways that encourage
responsible behavior by Russia while still deterring Russian
belligerence.

From a diplomatic perspective, we can find areas of common interest. One
of the most obvious examples is maintaining safety at sea. Despite the
recent aggressive "buzzing" of the USS Donald Cook (DDG-75) in the
Baltic by a Russian Su-24, the incidents-at-sea (INCSEA) agreements with
Russia remain a heartening example of how we can still cooperate with
Russia despite its leadership's adventurism. We also share a desire to
defeat violent extremist organizations such as ISIS. We must be prepared
to work with Russian leaders if they want to collaborate responsibly on
these or other issues of mutual interest. To do so, we can and should
meet with our Russian counterparts when possible and prudent. Track-two
diplomatic efforts, international symposiums, and other forums that
provide such opportunities should also be encouraged.

Of course, **[diplomacy alone is unlikely to be
sufficient]{.underline}**. **[To encourage]{.underline}** **[responsible
behavior]{.underline}** by Russia **[we must engage from]{.underline}**
**[a position of strength, not weakness]{.underline}**. **[Improving our
current force posture in Europe]{.underline}** will **[demonstrate our
strength]{.underline}** and thereby **[deter Russia from further
adventurism]{.underline}**. The first step in improving our force
posture is to leverage allied navies to enhance our maritime security.
**[We must work directly with our NATO partners]{.underline}** **[to
help them develop the capabilities and capacity to operate seamlessly
together and with the United States]{.underline}**, **[respond to
contingencies, and protect key maritime infrastructur]{.underline}**e.
Through combined exercises and maritime presence, a network of navies in
Europe and across the globe can face Russia from a position of strength
and ensure continued peace. Our part in supporting these efforts has
been clearly outlined by CNO Admiral John Richardson: We must
"**[prioritize]{.underline}** key **[international partnerships
through]{.underline}** **[information sharing, interoperability
initiatives, and combined operations]{.underline}** \[and\] **[explore
new opportunities for combined forward operations."]{.underline}**16 The
old saying "a house divided cannot stand" is more true now than it has
been in many years. **[To preserve peace]{.underline}**, **[we must
unite to deter Russian aggression.]{.underline}**

We also should **[reassess]{.underline}** our own **[global force
deployments and exercises]{.underline}**. **[Additional]{.underline}**
**[submarines, ASW forces]{.underline}**, carrier strike groups, and
other assets should be **[rotated through Europ]{.underline}**e and used
to show Russia that we can bring overwhelming force to bear if need be.
We should increase our ASW exercises with our NATO allies, in both the
Atlantic, Mediterranean, and elsewhere, to demonstrate that NATO can
track Russian submarines at will, no matter where they are.

Finally, **[we must not lose our technological edge.]{.underline}** More
than perhaps any other warfare area, **[ASW requires us to
stay]{.underline}** **[one step ahead of Russian
technologies]{.underline}**. In the world wars, the Allies prevailed
over German U-boats not by force alone, but by innovation. In the Cold
War, the rise of nuclear-powered Soviet submarines required us to
develop new acoustic and other technologies. Today, we are once again in
a technological arms race with Russia. **[We must]{.underline}**
maintain an innovative edge and **[rapidly field new
technologies]{.underline}** **[if we are to prevail]{.underline}**.17

At this time in history we would do well to remind ourselves **[it
is]{.underline}** **[better to prevent wars than to fight
them.]{.underline}** The U.S. Navy, **[through]{.underline}** forward
presence, power projection, and **[technological
advantage]{.underline}**, is the **[epitome of demonstrating resolve and
capability]{.underline}** in the **[service of war
prevention]{.underline}**. In today's world, wars can only be truly
prevented in partnership and cooperation with other nations. T**[he
stronger and more resolute we and our allies and partners are together,
the less likely that war will occur]{.underline}**. And therein lies the
true strength of the U.S. Navy---**[it is not simply by maintaining our
technological edge and our readiness to impose unacceptable costs on
Russia should the need arise]{.underline}**. What makes ours the world's
greatest and most effective navy is the fact **[that we act in concert
with our NATO allies and partners.]{.underline}** It is only in this way
that we, and **[all like-minded allies and partners, maintain peace---by
unmistakably and constantly deterring Russian aggression.]{.underline}**

**["Many assessments of]{.underline}** what **[the Russian
military]{.underline}** can and cannot do **[have been
inaccurate]{.underline}**. **[This isn't just problematic for the facts'
sake]{.underline}** -- more troubling, **[it risks skewing our
assessment of how far Moscow will go]{.underline}**...
**[When]{.underline}** **[Western analysts]{.underline}** -- and in
turn, Western **[leaders -- seek to discredit Russian military
capabilities, Moscow will likely continue to take the opportunity to
prove them wrong."]{.underline}**

Since non-NATO submarine deployments nearly ceased in the mid-1990s,
**[NATO]{.underline}** now **[has a generation of]{.underline}**
officers and civilian **[leaders who did not grow up experiencing the
"cat and mouse" environment of submarine warfare which existed during
the Cold War]{.underline}**. **[NATO]{.underline}** has conducted three
major **[joint operations]{.underline}** during **[since the end of the
Cold Wa]{.underline}**r. **[None]{.underline}** of these operations
**[were conducted in an area challenged by the presence of an adversary
submarine]{.underline}**. Just as air chiefs fight the perception NATO
will always have air superiority in any campaign, **[maritime leaders
must]{.underline}** also **[engage to challenge the perception that
NATO's maritime forces will always have maritime
superiority]{.underline}**. **[This perception]{.underline}**,
**[coupled with]{.underline}** **[inaccurate beliefs regarding the
capability of the Russian Federation's maritime
capability]{.underline}**, **[has coloured maritime defence spending for
decades]{.underline}**. As a result, **[NATO has ceded]{.underline}**
much of **[the advantage it earned at the conclusion of the Cold
War]{.underline}**. Therefore, to dispute this prevailing theory, this
study is intended to be read by a much broader audience than purely the
maritime component.

**[Unlocated submarines present numerous problems for]{.underline}**
both the Maritime component and for **[NATO writ large]{.underline}**.
**[An adversary submarine which is not tracked]{.underline}** from a
theatre level will have freedom of movement to **[pose numerous threats
to NATO forces and territories]{.underline}**. **[A single submarine
can]{.underline}** effectively **[close a maritime choke
point]{.underline}**, such as the Strait of Gibraltar, preventing
merchant traffic or naval forces from transiting.  An unlocated
submarine can **[lie in wait for a naval task force and effectively pick
off the high value]{.underline}** capital **[ships]{.underline}**,
**[removing in a single blow]{.underline}** a significant part of the
joint **[capability to project power]{.underline}** **[(aircraft
carrier, amphibious assault ship) or]{.underline}** resupply naval
forces at sea Adversary attack submarines (SSN) are charged with
detecting and potentially engaging not only NATO surface ships, but
NATO's **[ballistic]{.underline}** missile submarines serving as the
seaborne aspect of the **[nuclear deterrent]{.underline}**. **[If those
submarines are not tracked]{.underline}** at a theatre level, **[it puts
the nuclear deterrent force at risk.]{.underline}** Furthermore, **[an
unlocated submarine could establish a covert operating area close to a
NATO nation's coastline]{.underline}**. From there, it **[can project
striking power deep into NATO]{.underline}**, exploiting recent
advancements in modern cruise missile capability (some with ranges in
excess of 1500km) and ballistic missile capability. All of these
situations become significantly mitigated by tracking submarines
throughout their deployment at a theatre level. **[NATO]{.underline}**
excelled at tracking submarines in the Cold War, but the **[skills have
atrophied]{.underline}** and the resources have dwindled.

**[After]{.underline}** Russia's 2014 **[attack on
Ukraine]{.underline}**, the **[US \"saw an uptick of Russian navy
submarine out-of-area deployers,]{.underline}** which culminated in
Russian general-purpose submarines\" **[operating off of the US East
Coast]{.underline}**, Vice Adm. Daniel Dwyer, commander of the US Navy's
2nd Fleet, said at the WEST Conference in San Diego in February.

\"It was determined at that point that the **[Atlantic]{.underline}**
**[no longer provided that geography that enabled our
protection]{.underline}** **[and that standoff
\[distance\]]{.underline}** that we've enjoyed for so many decades,\"
added Dwyer, whose command was reactivated in 2018 in response to that
undersea activity.

Russian **[submarines]{.underline}** have **[also added the ability to
attack land targets with cruise missiles,]{.underline}** which they
demonstrated for the first time with strikes on ISIS targets in Syria in
2015, surprising US military leaders in Europe.

NATO commanders fear those **[missiles]{.underline}** **[could be used
against ports and other infrastructure in Europe]{.underline}**,
potentially **[interfering with]{.underline}** **[resupply and
reinforcement efforts.]{.underline}** Recent US and NATO drills have
focused on getting convoys across the Atlantic and to disembarkation
points in Europe.

US military leaders also see those **[missiles]{.underline}** as a
**[growing threat to the US mainland.]{.underline}** US Air Force Gen.
Glen VanHerck, who is responsible for North America as head of Northern
Command and NORAD, has repeatedly **[warned]{.underline}** about air-
and **[sea-launched cruise missiles]{.underline}**.

VanHerck has pointed specifically to **[Russia's Severodvinsk-class
guided-missile submarines]{.underline}**, calling them \"**[on par with
ours\"]{.underline}** and telling lawmakers this month that those subs,
also called the Yasen class, \"**[are designed to deploy undetected
within cruise-missile range of our coastlines to threaten critical
infrastructure during an escalating crisis]{.underline}**.\"

\"This **[challenge]{.underline}** **[will be compounded]{.underline}**
in the next few years as the Russian Navy adds the Tsirkon **[hypersonic
cruise missile]{.underline}** to the Severodvinsk's arsenal,\" VanHerck
told the House Armed Services Committee.

VanHerck has advocated **[new]{.underline}** and **[modernized detection
systems]{.underline}** **[to]{.underline}** **[spot activity in the sea
and the air around the US,]{.underline}** including updates to the
Navy's Integrated Undersea Surveillance System, which is important
\"**[as Russia and China continue to field highly advanced
guided-missile submarines]{.underline}**,\" VanHerck told lawmakers.

Russia's struggles on the ground in Ukraine have raised questions about
the quality of its military and its leadership after years of investment
and upgrades. **[Russia's navy has had a limited role in the
conflict]{.underline}** so far, and the US Navy's top **[civilian
official has cautioned against drawing conclusions about its
capabilities.]{.underline}**

\"One should **[never underestimate one's adversary,\"]{.underline}**
Navy Secretary Carlos del Toro said this month at the McAleese defense
conference. \"Perhaps the **[shortcomings that we've seen with regards
to the Russian army]{.underline}** as it invades Ukraine, the same
disadvantage **[doesn't necessarily translate over to the navy and their
submarine force.\"]{.underline}**

Moscow is **[investing]{.underline}** **[\"very strategically and
wisely\" in its submarines,]{.underline}** \"**[and their
technolog]{.underline}**y **[approaches ours,\"]{.underline}** del Toro
said, \"so one should never underestimate that capability and the threat
that that capability presents to us.\"

The good news for us is that scientists think the world will be
habitable for at least a few hundred million more years. **[The bad news
is there's a lot that could change that]{.underline}**. The risk of the
threats highlighted in the report actually causing mass casualties are
still small, but that doesn't mean they're not important to pay
attention to --- especially when the worst-case scenario means human
extinction. Here's what should be keeping you up at night and what,
realistically, might cause humans to go the way of dinosaurs. **[1)

#### Cohesive ASW in the Black Sea is key to deter [Russian aggression]{.underline} in the region

**Vișan 18 ---** George Vișan is an associate researcher at the Romania
Energy Center (ROEC). George Vișan (2018) Eurasia Daily Monitor Volume:
15 Issue: 8
<https://jamestown.org/program/growing-submarine-threat-black-sea/> WMK

In the four years that have passed since Russia annexed Crimea, the
**[number of]{.underline}** **[Russian submarines active in
the]{.underline}** **[Black Sea has grown]{.underline}** from one to
seven. These submarines **[pose a]{.underline}** **[grave threat to the
security of t]{.underline}**he North Atlantic Treaty Organization's
(**[NATO]{.underline}**) eastern flank. And together with the Kremlin's
military buildup on the occupied peninsula, they have **[shifted the
balance of forces in the region in Russia's favor.]{.underline}**

Immediately after the annexation of Crimea, **[Russia embarked
on]{.underline}** an **[ambitious program of modernizing its Black Sea
Fleet]{.underline}**, based out of Sevastopol. Originally, six Admiral
Grigorovich--class (Project 11356P/M) guided-missile frigates and six
Kilo-class submarines were to be constructed and deployed in the Black
Sea (Interfax, May 13, 2014). Both frigates and submarines are capable
of launching Kalibr land-attack cruise missiles with a range of over
2,000 kilometers. However, the ongoing war in eastern Ukraine has
delayed the building of the Admiral Grigorovich frigates as Kyiv stopped
supplying Russian defense contractors with the gas turbines necessary to
power them (see EDM, January 25, 2017; The Moscow Times, June 8, 2015).
Presently, only three ships have been commissioned.

Nevertheless, all six of the Kilo-class submarines have been delivered
and commissioned. Furthermore, four of these submarines have fired their
cruise missiles in anger in support of the Russian intervention in Syria
(the Rostov-na-Donu, Krasnodar, Veliky Novgorod and Kolpino). In
operational terms, this means that their crews are battle-tested and
have a high degree of confidence in their boats and weapons systems.

A veteran of the Cold War, the Kilo diesel-electric attack submarine
remains a potent weapons system to this day. It is one of the quietest
conventional submarines in service and one of the safest. In the
confines of the Black Sea and of the Eastern Mediterranean, these
submarines can strike targets with torpedoes and cruise missiles with
relative ease, while being protected by Russia's burgeoning anti-access
and area denial (A2/AD) "bubbles" (ROEC, July 14, 2015). Their
**[capability to launch Kalibr cruise missiles]{.underline}** **[makes
them extremely dangerous]{.underline}**, being **[able to hit targets
well inside the Black Sea region]{.underline}**, as well as in Europe,
Central Asia and the Middle East. As such, the Kilo **[submarine is an
A2/AD asset]{.underline}** **[as well as an]{.underline}** **[offensive
power projection platform,]{.underline}** **[capable of hitting NATO
facilities]{.underline}** in Central and Eastern Europe or to threaten
the Deveselu missile defense base in Romania (see EDM, February 16,
2017; September 19, 2017).

Among NATO members in the Black Sea, region only
**[Turkey]{.underline}** has fully developed anti-submarine warfare
(ASW) capabilities and can meet the challenge posed by Russian undersea
vessels. Furthermore, Turkey's control over the Bosporus and Dardanelles
Straits allows for easy monitoring of transiting Russian submarines.
However, Ankara's ASW **[capabilities]{.underline}** **[are divided
between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean Sea]{.underline}** **[and
its readiness is being put to the test by Russia's
assertiveness.]{.underline}** Romania and Bulgaria, the other two NATO
members in the region that possess navies, are struggling to offer up
any kind of effective response.

For NATO**[, the writing is on the wall]{.underline}**---it **[needs to
increase its ASW capabilities fast]{.underline}** **[in order to
deter]{.underline}** **[the Russian submarine threat.]{.underline}** As
part of the European Reassurance Initiative (ERI) US P-8 Poseidon
aircraft have begun patrolling over the Black Sea in order to track
these submarines and gather intelligence. Nevertheless, the presence of
Russian fighter aircraft as well as sophisticated air defense systems in
and around Crimea makes the P-8s vulnerable to interception and/or
interference (România Liberă, September 9, 2017). Clearly, besides a
stronger Alliance presence in the region, **[there needs to be an
overall increase in regional ASW capabilities.]{.underline}**

An obvious response to the Russian submarine threat in the Black Sea is
increasing Romania's and Bulgaria's naval capabilities. Romanian and
Bulgarian navies operate old ships equipped mostly with outdated Russian
sensors and weapons systems. Both countries have not acquired military
vessels since joining the North Atlantic Alliance, mostly due to
economic reasons. Nevertheless, the Russian military buildup in Crimea
has created a sense of urgency concerning naval capabilities for
Bucharest and Sofia.

In 2017, Bulgaria announced plans to acquire two multi-role corvettes
(Defense News, August 29, 2017), in effect reviving a program dating
back to 2007 (Novinite, October 2007). Romania is also preparing to
acquire multi-role corvettes, which it views as the single most
effective type of surface combatant for littoral areas (MApN.ro,
December 8, 2017). Bucharest is likely to purchase four such vessels in
a program that will span seven years and is estimated to be worth \$1.9
billion. Furthermore, the Romanian Navy plans to modernize its vintage
Type 22 frigates, acquired from the United Kingdom in 2003, using the
offset agreement from the corvette purchase (MApN.ro, December 8, 2017).
A decision concerning the corvette program is expected in 2018. Plans
have also been drawn up to buy submarines; but such an acquisition
process may not begin until sometime between 2020 and 2026 (Agerpres,
January 26, 2017).

Besides looking to obtain new ships for their aging fleets, Romania and
Bulgaria have been involved, since 2014, in numerous US- and NATO-led
naval exercises in the Black Sea and the Mediterranean. Exercises like
Sea Breeze 2017 (C6f.navy.mil, July 25, 2017) have included not only a
large number of NATO allies, but also Ukraine and Georgia, targets of
Russian aggression. Increasing the number of NATO joint exercises in the
Black Sea sends a clear deterrence signal to Moscow, while also
increasing capabilities and readiness at a fraction of the cost of new
military acquisitions.

**[In the short term]{.underline}**, it seems that **[Russia has the
upper hand in the Black Sea region]{.underline}** **[due to its
fast-paced rearmament drive]{.underline}** and sophisticated A2/AD
assets. However, **[NATO can overcome this threat by developing regional
capabilities]{.underline}** **[designed to thwart
apparen]{.underline}**t **[Russian advantages.]{.underline}** Smart
defense investments in critical capabilities, such as ASW, combined with
complex joint exercises **[can restore the regional military balance in
favor of the Alliance.]{.underline}**

Next, **[[NATO's presence in the Baltics]{.underline}]{.mark}** and
Poland **[[is]{.mark} the right size]{.underline}**: **[[large enough
to]{.mark} present a credible [deter]{.mark}rent to [Russia, but
not]{.mark} large enough to [present an offensive]{.mark} military
[threat]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[NATO was right to beef up]{.mark}
its [presence]{.mark} in the Baltics after 2014]{.underline}**. After
all, the three tiny Alliance members are simply incapable of defending
themselves alone in the unlikely event of war with Russia. But deploying
seven full brigades totaling 40,000 to 50,000 troops, as some analysts
suggest, would be destabilizing. Russia would doubtless perceive this
deployment as an offensive threat and increase its forces in response.
The four NATO battle groups currently deployed -- one each to the three
Baltic republics and Poland -- are important for their composition as
much as their size. These 5,000-plus troops could do no more than delay
a Russian incursion while NATO deployed reinforcements. But the fact
that 24 of the 30 NATO members contribute forces to the Alliance's
"Enhanced Forward Presence" mission makes it clear to Russia that NATO
is united in its determination to defend the Baltics, and that war there
means war with nearly all of NATO.

Lastly, **[[there is no indication]{.mark} that [Moscow has any
intention of invading the Baltics]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[Russia has
always seen the Baltics as different]{.underline}** from the rest of the
former Soviet Union. In short, when the Kremlin looks at Estonia,
Latvia, and Lithuania **[[it sees]{.mark}
[Europe]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[and it had always played by different
rules in Europe than in its self-designated "near
abroad"]{.underline}**. Anatol Lieven remarked on this Russian tendency
in his book The Baltic Revolution: "A large proportion of Baltic
Russians have been prepared to acknowledge that the Balts have a
superior civic culture, are cleaner, more orderly and harder working.
They may qualify this by saying that Russian life is 'friendlier', or
'more humane', but this is the exact reverse of the usual colonizer:
colonized self-images."

**[[Russia]{.mark}'s behavior toward the Baltic States immediately after
the collapse of the Soviet Union made clear the extent to which it
treats them differently. As it was intervening on behalf of separatist
movements in Georgia and Moldova, it [scrupulously avoided
escalating]{.mark} the situation with the Russian-speaking minorities in
Latvia and Estonia]{.underline}**. Despite the fact that Moscow was
exceptionally unhappy with the treatment of Russians speakers there, and
had military forces deployed to both countries until 1994, it always
expressed its grievances through official, institutional channels
instead of trying to rally the Russian-speaking minorities to violence
or intervening directly as it did elsewhere.

**[[Rather than]{.mark} fixate on [the Baltics]{.mark}, where the threat
is low and a deterrent force is in place]{.underline}**, **[[NATO should
pay]{.underline}]{.mark}** more **[[attention to the Black Sea]{.mark}
region. [It is here that Russia has already intervened]{.mark}
militarily, [and is attempting to fracture the Alliance and erode
confidence in its commitments]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [**[The Black
Sea]{.mark}** region also [serves as the hub for Russia's recent
expansion into]{.mark} the Eastern Mediterranean and is critical to its
efforts to support its intervention in [Syria]{.mark}]{.underline}.

There are four main reasons the Black Sea region demands more attention.

First, three of the six littoral states -- Romania, Bulgaria, and Turkey
-- are NATO members and two -- [**[Ukraine and Georgia]{.underline}** --
**[were]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[[promised membership]{.mark} in
2008]{.underline}**. [[Whether the Alliance should have
committed]{.mark} to membership for Ukraine and Georgia [is no longer
relevant; **it made the commitment and routinely reiterates it**]{.mark}
**at NATO summits**]{.underline}. **[[Every year that]{.mark} the fear
of Russia's reaction [delays]{.mark} progress on [bringing]{.mark} Kyiv
and Tbilisi [into NATO erodes confidence in NATO's other
commitments]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

Next, an examination of Russian military activities in the last
decade-plus leads to the conclusion that **[the Black Sea and Eastern
Mediterranean is the area of greatest geopolitical importance for
Russia]{.underline}**. [All of [its military interventions in]{.mark}
this period]{.underline} -- **[[Georgia, Ukraine and
Syria]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- [have [occurred in this region]{.mark},
and **[Moscow]{.mark} clearly [intends to challenge the]{.mark} [West in
this part of the world. NATO provides the best vehicle to meet this
challenge]{.mark}**]{.underline} and protect the important national
interests Western states have in this region.

Conclusion

These three **[[conflict scenarios are plausible]{.mark} risks [for the
Black ]{.mark}]{.underline}**Sea in 2020. Looking at "the wider Black
Sea area" over a medium-term perspective, a more complex array of
challenges is visible. In the Western Balkans, proposed land swaps and
**[[France's veto]{.mark} [against]{.mark} the European Union
[expansion]{.mark} add tension to a vulnerable region at the heart of
Europe]{.underline}**. To the south, Turkey's divergence from other NATO
members **[[and]{.underline}]{.mark}** the development of **[[Russia's
offensive military capability]{.mark} development]{.underline}** and
projection into the Mediterranean **[[add fuel to the
fire]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Along Turkey's southern border, **[[Iraq
and Syria will be consumed]{.mark} by humanitarian
tragedies.]{.underline}** Finally, looking east, **[China's
[B]{.mark}elt and [R]{.mark}oad [I]{.mark}nitiative [is
expanding]{.mark} Beijing's influence in the Black Sea]{.underline}**
and into Europe more broadly. **[[Increased]{.mark} security and
[stability in the Black Sea will be essential.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**[To prevent further conflict, [American]{.mark} and]{.underline}**
European **[[policymakers should prioritize the Black Sea]{.mark} as [a
security region]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} At a minimum, sanctions
against Russia should be maintained. The West should support Ukraine's
and Georgia's sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as their
Western path. To prevent China's buying up of the region, Western powers
should consider offering infrastructure investment opportunities as
alternatives to a poor and underdeveloped region while ensuring
visibility with regard to regional public opinion. Lastly, in the NATO
framework, pressure should be exerted to prevent Turkey from acting
against collective interests.

While the Baltic region is incredibly important for NATO, this lack of
focus on **[[the Black Sea]{.underline}]{.mark}** was unfortunate. The
region **[[matters]{.mark} to the U.S. and its NATO allies. The Black
Sea is home to three NATO members]{.underline}** (Romania, Turkey and
Bulgaria) **[and two aspirant NATO countries that face partial Russian
occupation]{.underline}** (Ukraine and Georgia). **[Important oil and
gas transit links crisscross the region. So do many important fiber
optic cables and shipping lanes.]{.underline}**

On the tactical level, Moscow's action in the region and its
militarization of Crimea furthers its goal of making the Black Sea a
Russian lake. Russia has deployed 28,000 troops to Crimea and has
embarked on a major program to build housing, restore airfields, and
install new radars there. In addition, **[Russia has deployed advanced
air defense and anti-ship missiles that give it a leg up above the rest
in terms of controlling the surface and the skies above the Black
Sea]{.underline}**.

**[On the strategic level]{.underline}**, **[[Russia uses the Black Sea
as a springboard to challenge U.S. interests]{.mark} [elsewhere]{.mark}
in the world]{.underline}**. For example, **[[Russia]{.mark} has
[used]{.mark} its [Black Sea]{.mark} presence]{.underline}** on occupied
Crimea **[[to launch]{.underline}]{.mark}** and support naval
**[[op]{.mark}eration[s]{.mark} [in support of]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**[Syria]{.underline}**, the Moskva, **[[a Russian navy guided]{.mark}

defense]{.mark} for Russian forces]{.underline}**. Hundreds of thousands
of tons of grain and wheat have been shipped from Crimea to Syria to
help the Assad Regime's food shortage problems. Hundreds of trips have
been made between Crimea's port city of Sevastopol and the Russian naval
base in Tartus, Syria to transport military hardware and resupplies.

Thankfully **[[policymakers are]{.mark} now [waking
up]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} For the U.S. three **[[Black Sea

45\. The principal purpose of ASW is to find a potential adversary's
submarines in a game of 'cat and mouse' (Perkins, 2016). Given the
difficulty of the task, **[ASW depends on high-end military
capabilities,]{.underline}** but as former US Chief of Naval Operations
Admiral Gary Roughead aptly notes, it is also "a mix of art and science"
(Roughead, 2018). Modern ASW mainly relies on a variety of manned
platforms **[utilising]{.underline}** passive and active **[sonar
systems]{.underline}** (see Box 3 and Table 3): - tactical submarines; -
fixed-wing maritime patrol aircraft (MPA); - surface vessels equipped
with sonar systems; - maritime ASW helicopters based on land or on
surface vessels; and - acoustic detection systems on the seabed or
installed on shore.

46\. **[NATO's]{.underline}** **[overall ability to conduct high-end ASW
operations]{.underline}** **[has]{.underline}** **[atrophied
substantiall]{.underline}**y. A 2017 tabletop exercise, led by a
renowned think tank, found that "**[neither the individual member
states, nor the Alliance as a whole]{.underline}**, **[presently possess
the ability to conduct a comprehensive and coordinated anti-submarine
warfare campaign]{.underline}** **[under either peacetime or wartime
conditions"]{.underline}** (Smith and Hendrix, 2017). One of the
participants argued that it would take 50 days or more to assemble an
effective ASW force. **[While NATO still retains the capability to
prosecute individual submarines]{.underline}** atv the current level of
Russian patrols, **[it will soon lose this ability if current trends
continue]{.underline}** (Perkins, 2016). In short, the Alliance **[has
"ceded much of the advantage it earned at the conclusion of the Cold
War]{.underline}**" (Perkins, 2016).

47\. **[NATO]{.underline}** faces a twin problem. For one, its own
**[ASW capabilities]{.underline}** **[have]{.underline}**
**[withered]{.underline}**, **[as the number of ASW-capable platforms
has fallen]{.underline}**, in some areas radically. Moreover, **[the
capabilities the Alliance still possesses]{.underline}** **[are rapidly
ageing and encounter interoperability problem]{.underline}**s (Hicks et
al., 2016). At the same time, **[the submarine capabilities of near-peer
competitors have increased significantly]{.underline}**, even if they
cannot best the most modern Allied submarines.

48\. Several reasons explain but do not excuse this state of affairs. As
the immediate threat of the Soviet Union waned in the early 1990s,
defence budgets began to shrink substantially. They took another big hit
after the financial crisis of 2007/2008. More importantly perhaps, a
strategic reorientation towards expeditionary warfare took place after
the Cold War ended. While based on sound reasons, this reorientation
came at a high price for other capability areas, including ASW (Perkins,
2016; Allport, 2018; Hudson and Roberts, 2018): - naval vessels
conducted more and more generic maritime security or were repurposed for
land attack missions; - MPAs increasingly focused on wider intelligence,
surveillance, and reconnaissance; - ASW-capable vessels almost ceased
operating in the North Atlantic and Arctic Oceans; and - some Allies
chose not to replace certain capabilities at the end of their lifetime.

49\. One area where Allies have retained robust capabilities, including
through timely replacement programmes, is maritime ASW helicopters.
Acoustic detection systems installed on the seabed or on shore are
highly classified systems, thus little information is available. Some
experts have stated that the United States has likely placed its large
underwater Sound Surveillance System near the GIUK gap in standby (Smith
and Hendrix, 2017). Experts also question its ability to detect the
quietest Russian submarines. The US Navy is pursuing upgrades and new
systems, but little is publicly known. Allied inventories of tactical
submarines, MPAs, and frigates either continue to face significant
shortfalls today or will in the near future. It is thus worth
highlighting the ongoing modernisation efforts in this regard.

B. TACTICAL SUBMARINES: HIGH QUALITY, MIXED PICTURE OVERALL

50\. The 124 tactical submarines currently available in Europe and North
America still possess superior qualities compared to non-NATO
submarines, with the US submarines remaining at the top of the class.
Nevertheless, quantity counts in ASW, and it is therefore regrettable
that the total number of submarines in the Alliance has fallen
drastically. A few examples illustrate this (Hicks et al., 2016): -
Denmark did not replace its last submarines when they reached the end of
their lifetime in 2004. - Germany's submarine numbers fell from 14 to 6
between 2000 and 2019 (-57%). - Norway went from 10 to 7 between 2000
and 2019 (-30%). - The United Kingdom dropped from 12 to 6 between 2000
and 2019 (-50%). - Even the United States possesses almost 10% fewer
submarines than at the end of the Cold War.

51\. The positive news is that **[all Allies with submarine fleets are
committed]{.underline}** to **[maintaining this
capability.]{.underline}** The most important submarine modernisation
programmes include the following: - Canada's new 2017 Defence Policy
committed to modernising its Victoria class submarines in the mid-2020s
to ensure their continued effectiveness into the mid-2030s (Government
of Canada, 2017). So far, the option analysis has been completed
(Government of Canada, 2019). The country purchased these submarines in
1998 from the United Kingdom, where they had entered service in the
early 1990s. - The four Walrus class submarines of the Netherlands need
to be replaced in the second half of the 2020s. The country is set to
decide on a follow-on procurement programme by the second half of 2019
(Sprenger, 2019a). To replace its Rubis class submarines, France is in
the process of building Barracuda class nuclear-powered general-purpose
submarines (Sprenger, 2019b). Six are planned (Sprenger, 2019b). The
first of these submarines, the Suffren, was launched in July 2019 and is
expected to be delivered in 2020 (Sprenger, 2019b). - Germany's
diesel-electric Type 212 submarines boast some of the most advanced
air-independent propulsion technology in the world. The German navy will
add another two to its fleet in the coming years under a joint programme
with Norway (NavalToday.com, 2019). - Italy plans to procure another
four German-designed Type 212 submarines to remain at eight submarines
once its four Pelosi class submarines retire (Kington, 2019). - Norway's
six Ula class submarines will reach the end of their lifespan in the
mid- to late-2020s. They will be replaced by submarines based on the
German Type 212 class under a joint programme with Germany
(NavalToday.com, 2019). - Poland's submarines are deemed not
combat-relevant by experts (Hicks et. Al, 2016). However, the country
has committed to procuring new ones and initiated a competition for the
programme (Lesiecki, 2018). - Spain's S-80 Plus class programme has run
into severe problems, forcing the country to maintain its S-70 Agosta
class submarines, which entered service in the early 1980s, in service
longer than expected (Roblin, 2018). - Turkey has launched a mid-life
upgrade for its four Preveze class submarines (Vavasseur, 2019b). - The
UK Royal Navy is in the process of replacing the Trafalgar class
submarines with the highly capable Astute class submarines. Three Astute
submarines are already in service (UK Royal Navy, n.d.). The Ministry of
Defence has already launched a Maritime Underwater Future Capability
project for the time when the Astute class will leave service (Bliddal,
2019). - While the United States is accelerating its submarine
procurement, it will still face a tactical-submarine shortfall in the
mid-2020s, when their number will bottom out at about 42 (McLeary,
2019). This prospect is likely a driving factor in the accelerated
acquisition of maritime unmanned systems (see next section).

C. MARITIME PATROL AIRCRAFT: A KEY SHORTFALL AREA

52\. The capability shortfall in Maritime Patrol Aircraft (MPAs) for ASW
missions has been especially dramatic. Compared to the end of the Cold
War, the Alliance now possesses 120 fewer MPAs (Perkins, 2016). One data
point illustrates what this really means: while the ratio of available
Allied MPAs to Soviet submarines was about 1.8 to 1 at the end of the
1980s, the ratio has more than inversed at 1 Allied MPA for 2 Russian
submarines (Perkins, 2016). While MPAs are certainly expensive assets,
they cannot be replaced solely by a layered federated system of sensors
(Perkins, 2016). Indeed, to maintain 24-hour coverage of a single
submarine, a country needs about seven to eight MPAs (Perkins, 2016).

53\. The majority of the Allies' MPAs will reach the end of their
operational lives in the 2025-2035 timeframe. As one industry
interlocutor put it during the recent STCTTS visit to the United
Kingdom, the Alliance is facing a "15-year crunch time". They have
realised the urgency of this challenge. Indeed, eight Allies have
pursued a Multinational Maritime Multi Mission Aircraft Capabilities
Cooperation under NATO's aegis since 2017 (see Figure 1). They have
begun to define common requirements for such future aircraft
capabilities, with ASW very much at the centre.

54\. Individual Allies are already in the process of procuring new
MPAs: - France and Germany have declared their intent to work together
in replacing their MPA fleets in a broader European project (Shalal,
2018). - Norway is replacing its P-3C Orion fleet with five P-8 Poseidon
MPAs (Reim, 2019). I taly's new ATR-72 MPAs are not configured for ASW,
but the airframe could, in principle, be upgraded with this capability
in the future (Kington, 2016). - Turkey intends to procure six ATR-72
MPAs with ASW capabilities (Aviation News, 2016). - The United Kingdom
currently finds itself in a severe situation. In 2011, its Nimrod MPAs
were not replaced. This has left the United Kingdom without an MPA
capability and dependent on Allied support in the face of increased
submarine activity along its shores. The government is therefore
acquiring nine P-8 Poseidon MPAs. The first of these is set to move to
the United Kingdom in early 2020, and the last aircraft is expected to
be delivered by March 2022 (US DOD, 2019b).

55\. Another MPA-related shortfall is the very low level of sonobuoys,
which MPAs (and ASW helicopters) drop into the sea to hunt submarines
(Perkins, 2016). While these depleted inventories alone should be a
cause for alarm, the situation is made worse by the fact that
significantly more sonobuoys are now needed to achieve Cold War-levels
of detection because submarines have become much quieter (Perkins,
2016). Their utility has certainly been falling. However, in the short
to medium term, they are still very much needed to locate submarines in
a dynamic hunt, as newer technologies are not yet capable of fully
compensating -- and will not be within the next decade or two (see next
section). Allies must therefore urgently build up stockpiles. Perhaps a
NATO Smart Defence project similar to the joint procurement of
precision-guided munitions could be explored. Indeed, Allies can already
place sonobuoy orders through the NATO Support and Procurement Agency.

D. ONGOING FRIGATE MODERNISATION ACROSS THE ALLIANCE

56\. The ASW capabilities on surface vessels have not fallen quite as
drastically, but certain Allies have seen significant reductions. For
example, the Atlantic-facing NATO member states, who carry the brunt of
the ASW burden on NATO's northern flank, lost about half of their
frigate inventory between 1995 and 2017 (Smith and Hendrix, 2017). Even
the United States faces difficulties. The US Navy is cutting the number
of vessels equipped with the Surveillance Towed Array Sensor System from
nine to five, possesses no frigate class specially dedicated to ASW, and
lost ASW capabilities when the S-3 Viking fixed-wing aircraft retired
from carriers in 2009 (Smith and Hendrix, 2017).

57\. **[Allies are well aware of the need for high-end
ASW]{.underline}** surface vessels and are reacting accordingly.
Importantly, 12 Allies are in the process of procuring new frigates,
with many of these being designed for improved ASW capabilities. Some of
the modernisation programmes most relevant to ASW include the
following: - Belgium and the Netherlands are developing a new Future
Surface Combatant to replace the M-Frigates in their inventory
(Fiorenza, 2018). The first new frigate should be delivered to the
Netherlands by the mid-2020s (Naval Recognition, 2018). - In a sign that
Canada takes the ASW threat seriously, its government has selected the
Type 26 frigate, designed in the United Kingdom and optimised for ASW,
to replace its Halifax class frigates (Allison, 2018). - Six of France's
new FREMM frigates have been ASW optimised, with the last frigate
delivered in July 2019 (OCCAR, 2019). Moreover, a number of older
frigates will be retrofitted with towed array sensors (Hicks et al.,
2016). - Germany's MKS-180 frigates, which are under development, will
have an advanced ASW module option (Vavasseur, 2019a). - The United
Kingdom will replace its Type 23 frigates, which are highly capable of
ASW operations, with the new Type 26 class optimised for ASW (Willett,
2018). However, it has cut its planned orders from 13 to 8 (Willett,
2018). - The United States will design its new FFG(X) frigate with
excellent ASW capabilities in mind. The US Navy wants to procure 20
FFG(X) by 2030, with the first frigate of this type procured in 2020
(Congressional Research Service, 2019).

VI\. TOWARDS A NEW VISION FOR ASW

58\. The previous section laid out some of the short- and medium-term
challenges to the Alliance's ASW capabilities as well as some ways
Allies plan to rebuild them. However**[, in the longer
term,]{.underline}** **[much more]{.underline}** **[complex challenges
abound]{.underline}**. On the one hand, the **[seas are becoming louder
and warmer, making it harder to detect submarines]{.underline}**
(Perkins, 2016). **[Maritime background noise]{.underline}** has more or
less **[doubled every decade]{.underline}**, and **[radio-frequency
interference has also risen markedly]{.underline}** (Perkins, 2016). On
the other hand, **[submarines are getting quieter and increasingly hard
to detect]{.underline}** a**[s they employ better hull designs,
air-independent propulsion, noise-cancelling, and acoustic jamming
system]{.underline}**s (Clark, 2015b). As a consequence of this twin
movement, it is entirely possible that 'sound parity' might soon occur
-- i.e. submarines could become quieter than the sea's ambient noise
(Perkins, 2016).

A. SENSOR TECHNOLOGIES

59\. **[Progress in traditional sonar detection
technologies]{.underline}** **[continues to be slow and evolutionary
(]{.underline}**O'Hanlon, 2018). As submarines become quieter, the
**[detection ranges for passive sonars --]{.underline}** the **[dominant
ASW sensor for the last five decades]{.underline}** -- **[have fallen
from multiple miles to hundreds of yards]{.underline}** (Perkins, 2016).
Active sonar system ranges are still in the range of single-digit
kilometres, but they face problems in the classification of submarine
signals (Perkins, 2016). All this leads one expert to argue that
**[traditional sensors]{.underline}** "**[are]{.underline}** **[rapidly
approaching a point of obsolescence]{.underline}**" (Perkins, 2016).
However, **[artificial intelligence, big data, and the miniaturisation
of computing power]{.underline}** **[could help]{.underline}**
**[sustain traditional sensor technologies]{.underline}** for some time.
For example, **[artificial intelligence applications are enabling
oceanographic modelling]{.underline}** in (near) real time, **[boosting
ASW sensor capabilities]{.underline}** **[significantly]{.underline}**,
and **[giving the means to sift through the enormous amount of gathered
data to find an actual target]{.underline}** (Clark, 2015a).

60\. Faced with the plateauing of traditional sensor capabilities,
scientists and engineers are working on making new technologies viable.
Non-acoustic detection methods are an increasing area of focus.
Researchers hope to develop technologies that could, for example, detect
the chemical and radiological emissions of submarines, bounce laser
light off submarines to make them visible, or sense the tiny changes in
ocean surface levels, wave patterns, or ocean temperatures when a
submarine passes underneath (Clark, 2015a; Perkins, 2016; Hicks et al.,
2016). Quantum technologies are crucial components for non-acoustic
sensors. Scientists and researchers in Allied member states, but notably
also in China, are investing in this area.

61\. Navies are also developing new detection systems which can be
installed on the seabed or on land, or float in water. The US Navy, for
example, has programmes for a portable sensor to be installed at key
chokepoints in the Shallow Water Surveillance System and the Persistent
Littoral Undersea Surveillance (Clark, 2015a).

B. MARITIME UNMANNED SYSTEMS

62\. **[In addition to new sensors,]{.underline}** a **[new vision for
the future of ASW is taking shape based on]{.underline}** **[maritime
unmanned systems]{.underline}** (see also Figure 2). MARCOM Deputy
Commander Vice Admiral Bléjean told Committee members that he saw
maritime unmanned systems as **[future "game changers]{.underline}**".
**[Allies needed to]{.underline}** **[understand the technology today to
prepare for this future]{.underline}**, especially since non-NATO navies
were investing heavily in them, members heard.

63\. Maritime unmanned systems comprise two classes of autonomous
unmanned vehicles (AUV): unmanned surface vessels as well as unmanned
underwater vessels. Unmanned surface vessels can range from the big Sea
Hunter to small Aqua Quads or Wave Gliders. Unmanned underwater vessels
come in all sizes too -- from buoyancy gliders to the extra-large Boeing
Echo Voyager and Lockheed Martin Orca.

64\. **[AUVs]{.underline}** offer many potential advantages for naval
forces, as they **[can be designed to be: - smaller and thus less
detectable]{.underline}** than manned platforms; - **[much more focused
on the payload,]{.underline}** as no human operators need to be
accommodated; - **[highly modular and scalable;]{.underline}** and - at
sea for long durations of time if power generation and storage
challenges can be overcome (see below).

65\. Moreover, AUVs **[could reduce personnel and unit costs and
compress research]{.underline}** and **[development
cycles]{.underline}**, as certain complex systems would be cut out.
Perhaps most importantly, they could operate in degraded or denied
environments without putting lives at risk.

66\. A naval future based on **[AUVs]{.underline}**, integrated with
traditional platforms, could still be a decade or two away.
Nevertheless, Allies see **[great potential for a number of naval
missions]{.underline}**, **[including ASW]{.underline}**. As a result,
14 **[Allies signed a declaration of intent]{.underline}** in October
2018 to **[cooperate on the introduction of maritime unmanned
systems]{.underline}** (see Figure 4). The **[initiative aims to pool
resources, talent, and ingenuity to create better, more flexible, and
more interoperable AUVs]{.underline}**. The initiative seeks economies
of scale to enable cost saving in what is set to become an area of
increased investment.

67\. The concept of distributed networks is the key to understanding how
many **[Allies see]{.underline}** **[the future of ASW based on
AUVs.]{.underline}** Net**[works of manned and unmanned sensors from the
sea floor to space would combine into a single system of
systems]{.underline}**. Navies would move away from platforms packed to
the brim with ASW sensors. Instead, they would employ smaller platforms
with fewer capabilities. While they would individually perform far fewer
tasks than today's ASW platforms, **[the scale of the overall
system]{.underline}** **[would give it an edge.]{.underline}** The US
Navy, which in 2019 asked for USD 3.7 billion for future AUV programmes,
envisages potentially thousands of such AUVs working together. An
adversary would thus be overwhelmed with a multitude of small targets
instead of a naval group consisting of a few surface vessels. Opponents
would need to place expensive weapons on targets that are much less
costly than the frigates of today. The distributed network would also
have sufficient redundancy built-in, so that an adversary would be
unable to neutralise all systems simultaneously. Swarming technology
could also lead to maritime unmanned systems where AUVs could be placed
in a 'net' which moves with a target once detected. Such a swarm of AUVs
would form a 'roaming net of sonobuoys', replacing today's 'one-time
use' sonobuoys in the long run. Concepts of launching unmanned aerial
vehicles from MPAs or underwater platforms to release sonobuoys are also
being explored. The UK government will soon begin researching and
testing extra-large unmanned underwater vehicles for the purpose of
creating ASW 'barriers'. Greece has also tested unmanned surface vessels
in combination with dipping sonars originally designed for helicopters.
AUVs could, of course, also play a key role in monitoring undersea cable
networks.

68\. Manned systems -- frigates, MPAs, and submarines -- would still
play very important roles in such distributed networks. However, they
could move away from the front line by acting as a host for unmanned
systems or a coordinator of sensors and weapon systems. They could
gather intelligence, conduct surveillance, mine strategic chokepoints,
and engage in electronic warfare in areas of high risk for manned
platforms (Clark, 2015a).

69\. Unsurprisingly, many challenges exist before such a future becomes
possible. Secure communication is a long-standing challenge for the
underwater domain and for the link with surface, air, or space assets.
However, progress is being made in acoustic communications over
operationally relevant distances, albeit at low bandwidth; in
short-range communications based on LED or laser systems approaching, at
short distances, the quality of wired communication; and in networking
floating or towed radio transceivers to communicate with surface vessels
without them risking detection (Clark, 2015a).

70\. Collision avoidance will also likely remain a key challenge (Clark,
2015a). Compared to unmanned aerial systems, AUVs face dense traffic on
the world's seas, especially in strategic areas. However, until
navigation systems become more powerful, navies can concentrate their
maritime unmanned systems efforts on those missions where mistakes do
not matter as much. For example, autonomous mine-counter systems are
currently more advanced than ASW systems, as mine countering is a less
dynamic task.

71\. Power generation and storage on AUVs remains yet another problem
and thus a focus of research, with researchers developing new battery
and fuel-cell technologies. Indeed, a recent RAND study pointed out that
the limitations of power generation and storage are currently the major
obstacles holding back high-end AUVs (Martin et al., 2019).

72\. Many other questions surround the future of maritime unmanned
systems, for example: - How can the intelligence collected be
disseminated in a relevant time frame? - How do systems adapt and filter
out clutter and ambient noise to find objects of interest? - Can systems
readily scale up -- a key precondition to make them as capable as manned
ASW assets? - Can advanced sensors be miniaturised to fit on low-power,
long-endurance AUVs? - How can AUVs be launched, recovered, and
refuelled in an efficient manner to be militarily relevant? - How will
AUVs be able to operate with legacy systems? - What would command and
control, operational concepts, and doctrines look like?

73\. Kevin LePage, Cooperative ASW Program Manager at the NATO Centre
for Maritime Research and Experimentation (CMRE), told Committee members
in Northwood in June 2019 that ASW is very challenging. Moving into a
future with maritime unmanned systems in the loop will be even more
challenging. Still, despite the obstacles, the possibilities AUVs offer
and the challenges the Alliance faces make it imperative to continue
investing into research and development programmes and, simultaneously,
demonstrate the value of these systems to today's operators and build
operators' trust in these systems, which may perhaps be the most
important element in integrating AUVs into ASW.

VII\. CONCLUSIONS

74\. This report has made it clear that the **[Alliance is facing an
increased and concrete submarine threat from Russia]{.underline}**.
**[The Alliance must continue to monitor this threat and react
accordingly.]{.underline}** This threat is not limited to traditional
'hard security' threats. It also presents a clear, imm**[ediate danger
when seen in the light of Russia's asymmetric and hybrid
strateg]{.underline}**y, **[which seeks to increase its power,
influence, and economic strength and to isolate, undermine, and split
the Alliance over time]{.underline}**. Moreover, **[NATO and the Allies
must also pay close attention to submarine developments in China, North
Korea, and beyond.]{.underline}**

75\. **[Allies have let their ASW capabilities atrophy to dangerous
levels.]{.underline}** This report has laid out a path towards: -
**[rebuilding capabilities across the full spectrum]{.underline}** in
the short and medium terms **[through]{.underline}** investments in and
**[modernisation of ASW]{.underline}** assets; and - **[a future of ASW
based on new sensor technologies and the integration of AUVs into ASW
missions.]{.underline}**

76\. **[The Alliance must also increase its focus on threats against
undersea cable networks]{.underline}**. Non-technical ways to increase
the security of these cables are available, for example by increasing
resilience or improving international law. Technical solutions include
monitoring systems at key sites, and maritime unmanned systems could
play an important role in this respect. Also, the frequency of training
and exercising such maritime hybrid threat scenarios, including at the
NATO level, must be increased.

77\. As with other capability shortfall areas, it must be stressed that
it is essential that Allies live up to the Wales Defence Investment
Pledge and move towards spending a minimum of 2% of GDP on defence and
more than 20% of defence budgets on major equipment, including related
research and development. If NATO wants to remain in a position where it
can fulfil its core tasks, Allies must increase investment in ASW
capabilities at the national level and, when appropriate, at the
multinational level. They must continue to maintain robust fleets of
tactical submarines, MPAs, ASW-capable surface vessels, maritime ASW
helicopters, and acoustic detection systems.

78\. As this Committee has made abundantly clear over the last few
years, **[NATO's science and technology (S&T) edge is
eroding]{.underline}**. This trend appears to be particularly stark in
ASW. Thus, ASW should be a test of the Alliance's willingness to heed
the Committee's recommendations put forward in NATO PA Resolution 453,
which was adopted in November 2018. Indeed, ASW is an area where NATO
can make great strides jointly, in particular by leveraging its 2018
NATO S&T Strategy.

79\. The NATO Multinational Maritime Multi Mission Aircraft Capabilities
Cooperation and the Maritime Unmanned Systems initiative are positive
steps in the right direction. It is also encouraging that the NATO
Industrial Advisory Group (NIAG) is conducting a study on the Utility of
Unmanned Vehicles in NATO ASW.

80\. Most importantly perhaps, **[NATO already has a world-class S&T
institution]{.underline}** at its **[disposal to further an ASW future
based on maritime unmanned systems]{.underline}**: the Centre for
Maritime Research and Experimentation in La Spezia, Italy. The CMRE is
leading the way for advances in AUV applications and operations, **[in
particular demonstrating the potential of AUVs and remote operation and
management of a fleet]{.underline}** of undersea gliders and promoting
the use of underwater digital communications **[using a NATO-developed
standar]{.underline}**d. Allies should make good use of the Centre and,
vitally important, improve the funding mechanisms for the CMRE to make
it fit for the future. With the current and future submarine threat, the
Centre is needed more than ever. In turn, the CMRE should continue to
help NATO improve agility and demonstrate the value of S&T to the
military community. This includes continued engagement in NATO exercises
to showcase what today's S&T can offer Allied naval forces. The
Committee will pay close attention to the adaptation of the CMRE. The
Rapporteur is pleased that the CMRE Director will lay out her vision at
the 2019 Annual Session.

81\. **[NATO can no longer be in a situation where its ASW capabilities
could potentially be overwhelmed.]{.underline}** Too much is at stake.
The Rapporteur therefore calls on all Committee members to **[ensure
national ASW capabilities meet the task at hand]{.underline}** and
invites them to **[explore multinational efforts to further strengthen
synergies between Allies.]{.underline}** Through the Committee's
available instruments, the Committee remains committed to closely
following progress on rebuilding the Alliance's ASW capabilities and
preparing for the future.

NETWORK TO SEIZE OPPORTUNITIES Initiative 4: Share, pool, and store
non-sensitive data sets. The **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[[should work with
allied]{.mark}]{.underline}** and partner **[[governments to develop
common standards for sharing, pooling, and storing]{.mark}
non-sensitive, [government-owned data]{.mark} sets]{.underline}**.
**[[U.S. allies and partners are broadly open]{.mark} [to]{.mark}
non-sensitive data-[sharing arrangements]{.mark}]{.underline}**:
**[Nearly [90 percent]{.mark} of officials [indicated interest in
sharing]{.mark} more data with the United States]{.underline}**, and 75
percent cited specific non-sensitive data their country would be willing
to share. More than half of responding countries indicated a willingness
to share weather pattern data, epidemiological data for disease control,
medical images for precision medicine, and video and navigation data
from self-driving cars. **[This initiative may be among the most
important for America's European partners]{.underline}**. An EU official
noted that the EU would likely be willing to share quite a lot of data,
provided rules are in place and enforced. Another official from the UK
expressed enthusiasm around the idea of a transnational data sharing
framework allowing partners to aggregate more diverse data and create
more reliable models that could operate between markets. Non-sensitive
data-sharing projects could start small. The United States, the United
Kingdom, and France already cooperate on predictive maintenance for the
C-130J military transport aircraft. They could extend this initiative to
other aircraft or broaden to include other countries by sharing relevant
data collected during the planning process for maintenance, repair, and
overhaul. **[The [U]{.mark}]{.underline}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[[could partner
with]{.underline}]{.mark}** Singapore, Spain, Italy, and other [**[NATO
allies]{.underline}** **[on a data-sharing initiative related to
m]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[aritime [d]{.mark}omain [a]{.mark}wareness in
the way that Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore, for example, share
hydrographic data and cooperate [to improve]{.mark} their]{.underline}**

[capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}**.52 **[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}**
states that the maritime domain "is of strategic importance." **[Its
[members]{.mark} [could share militarily relevant]{.mark} [datasets to
improve]{.mark} maritime domain [awareness in the Black Sea and]{.mark}
other [strategic]{.mark} [locales]{.mark}]{.underline}**.53
**[[U.S]{.mark}. policymakers [could]{.mark} also [work with]{.mark}
counterparts in allied and [partner countries to develop common
standards]{.mark} for data archival procedures[, including]{.mark}
standards [for ensuring the data is labeled, stored, interoperable, and
accessible]{.mark}]{.underline}**.54 The U.S. Open Government Initiative
began to lay the groundwork for common data standards as early as 2013,
and the United States should promote similar practices among allies and
partners.55 **[Such a [collaborative approach]{.mark} would [enable data
flows and]{.mark} promote healthy data management among allies that
could [further propel the growth of AI]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Optimal
Partners: United Kingdom, Germany, Japan, France, the Netherlands, and
New Zealand **[Multilateral Fora: NATO]{.underline}**, the European
Commission, Five Eyes, OECD, Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) Criteria for Partnership: Optimal data-sharing partners would be
countries that widely collect and publish data for public use, and
countries where that data is stored and accessible by third parties. To
assess capability and compatibility, we selected metrics reflecting the
amount of data that allied and partner governments generate and capture.
We included data from the Open Knowledge Foundation's Global Open Data
Index, which measures the volume and types of publicly available
government data, such as national statistics, procurement practices, air
quality and weather information, and company registry information.56 We
also included the number of data processing centers in each country and
the gross value of imported data storage units.57 While it is difficult
to determine what kind of data they store or how much storage capacity
they have, the dollar value of data processing and storage centers is a
reasonable proxy for national data capacity and reflects the amount of
data generated by entities in each country. Moreover, we featured three
indicators from the CSET survey: expressed interest in data sharing with
the United States, whether the country has taken actions to enhance data
archival procedures, and whether it has established data use standards.
20 Center for Security and Emerging Technology Finally, we compared
legal environments in each country as they pertain to data sharing.58
Although all the countries listed in Table 5 fall under the jurisdiction
of the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), they have no
apparent localization requirements, nor do they prevent the transfer of
certain classes of data across borders.59 Moreover, shared data
standards under the GDPR may make it easier for the United States to
collect the same kind of data from multiple countries in the future.
Other considerations and caveats: Other high-scoring countries include
South Korea, Finland, Denmark, Lithuania, Latvia, and the Czech
Republic. The United States would do well to diversify its sources of
data, including from countries beyond the jurisdiction of the GDPR.
India, for example, boasts a large population, vibrant technology
market, and high concentration of data processing facilities Initiative
5: Invest in privacy-preserving machine learning. To protect individual
privacy, the United States and its allies and partners should explore
techniques in data analysis that would allow them to perform operations
on non-sensitive data sets without sharing or storing personally
identifiable information. These techniques are known as
privacy-preserving machine learning. Researchers Roxanne Heston and
Helen Toner observe that privacy-preserving machine learning could make
"new uses of AI possible without triggering privacy concerns, give U.S.
companies a competitive edge over their foreign counterparts, and/or
reduce cybersecurity risks by protecting individual data while
preserving its usefulness."60 Applications of privacy-preserving machine
learning could include performing object and facial recognition locally
on an individual's phone instead of processing that data in the cloud,
thereby improving security and privacy; employing differential privacy
models to obscure the identities of individuals in census research; and
using secure multi-party computation to combat tax fraud.61 Coordinated
investment initiatives in homomorphic encryption, secure multi-party
computation, and federated learning would enable democratic,
market-based economies to benefit from larger and more diverse pools of
data without compromising the privacy of individual users and
organizations whose data are in the pools. U.S. allies and partners are
especially willing to collaborate on this front. Nearly all surveyed
officials indicated interest in collaborating on an international
certification scheme for the protection of personal data, with
two-thirds of surveyed officials indicating high interest. As
Australia's AI Ethics Framework notes, "Throughout their lifecycle, AI
systems should respect and uphold privacy rights and data protection,
and ensure the security of data."62 The United States and its allies
should discuss potential use cases where privacy-preserving machine
learning could be developed and deployed, coordinate research and
development priorities that further applications suitable to these
technologies, and create guidelines and technical standards to promote
safe and reliable applications in realistic scenarios.63 More broadly,
the United States and its allies should co-fund research and coordinate
investments into new techniques, such as synthetic data, advanced
simulations, and improvements in transfer learning, for making personal
data less relevant to AI systems. Optimal Partners: Canada, India,
Germany, Australia, Japan, and the United Kingdom Multilateral Fora: EU,
OECD, the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (India, Japan, Australia, and
the United States), National Institute of Standards and Technologyand
National Science Foundation (NSF)-led bilateral and multilateral
partnerships 22 Center for Security and Emerging Technology Criteria for
Partnership: The United States should coordinate with countries whose
scientists produce most of the world's cutting-edge AI research focused
on privacy and anonymity, such as homomorphic encryption and federated
learning techniques. Ideal partners would also respect online privacy
and share U.S. concerns about digital illiberalism. To measure
countries' relative strengths in privacy-preserving machine learning, we
counted the number of patents and scientific publications from
scientists affiliated with local research institutions. We only assessed
patents and publications labeled as relevant to artificial intelligence
and computer vision applications that explicitly mention "privacy" or
"anonymity."64 We included Freedom House's scores of internet freedom in
each country as a proxy for governments' commitments to democratic
values and civil liberties.65 We also aggregated four measures from the
CSET survey to capture countries' focus on privacy: expressed interest
in an international scheme for the protection of personal data,
government action taken to enhance privacy protections, perceptions of
the need for international management of facial recognition, and the
country's likelihood of regulating surveillance technology. Other
considerations and caveats: France and South Korea produce a large
number of AI patents related to privacy and score highly on Freedom on
the Net. U.S. policymakers could also consider partnering with
individual tech companies abroad to further privacy-preserving research
projects. The frequency of the phrase "privacy" in national AI
strategies is a crude measure: India and the United Kingdom score "0,"
for example, but both countries are likely deeply concerned about
privacy issues Initiative 6: **[Promote interoperability and agile
software development. [Interoperability is a critical lubricant for U.S.
alliances]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[To operate effectively, allies need
to plan, train, and exercise together]{.underline}**. Joint operational

military systems expected to perform a given function, the **[United

and performance]{.mark} based on the same training and testing

officials expressing the need for international coordination and
management of AI military applications]{.underline}**,
**[[specifically]{.underline}]{.mark}** autonomous weapons systems and
[**[unmanned]{.underline}** **[vehicles for submarine
detection]{.underline}**]{.mark}. A German representative stated that
**[[collaboration]{.mark} with the United States would be [enhanced
by]{.mark} an AI strategy that includes a [focus on AI-related

United States and its allies should also consider **[[wargaming and
table-top exercises to explore how sharing]{.mark} selected government
[data sets could shore up defenses]{.mark} against counter-AI techniques
[and]{.mark} other efforts to exploit the vulnerabilities of AI systems.
Specifically, they should explore how sharing militarily relevant data
sets and certain AI algorithms could help allied countries better test
system robustness, [expose mutual vulnerabilities,]{.mark} accelerate
development of countermeasures, [and establish common standards for
testing, verification, and validation]{.mark}]{.underline}**.68 **[The
United States and its allies should define common standards for the
level of robustness required for a given operation]{.underline}**.
**[[Common defense planning]{.underline}]{.mark}** and capability
development **[[in NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}** and the EU **[[should
give priority to investments in AI safety and security]{.mark}, as well
as common verification procedures for AI-enabled, safety-critical
systems]{.underline}**. **[To ensure allies store and process data
homogeneously, the United States and its allies should launch an
accelerator fund for cloud computing]{.underline}**. The United States
and its allies could use this fund to more efficiently procure
commercial cloud computing technology. The United States, United
Kingdom, and Canada, for example, could agree to bid out a bulk purchase
of cloud compute from major technology companies and distribute access
to compute in the form of credits and publicly funded research. This
initiative would ensure that democratic nations benefit from techniques
in machine learning that require fewer inputs of real-world data but
greater computational power to run simulations and self-play methods.
Representatives from Japan, South Korea, the Czech Republic, Lithuania,
and the EU each cited increased computing as an AI R&D priority,
suggesting an area for aligning focus among allies.

expectations."70 For instance, **[although [France]{.mark} is likely to

[**[it remains]{.underline}** **[unsympathetic]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[[to integration]{.mark} and cooperation [within any]{.mark}
[multilat]{.mark}eral [environment]{.mark}]{.underline}**. A senior
official of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs explained that France
would always want to preserve its strategic autonomy.72 In sum, the
second priority for the ASG-I&S should be accepting the continuation of
bilateral arrangements between NATO and its Member States.
**[Notwithstanding the prominent position of major European nations, the
ASG-I&S as his third priority should acknowledge a [dominant role for

expand existing enablers such as the underused BICES,75 in close
cooperation with SHAPE/NIFC, embracing best practices from missions like
joint databases and the Afghan Mission Network (AMN).76 In the process,
he should safeguard reciprocity and intervene if information is one-way,
as is the case with CT -- namely to and not from the United States.77
Should Freytag von Loringhoven **[want to address other [constraints

the US Department of Defense recommended an update of the US disclosure
policy and procedures concerning sharing of intelligence in a coalition
environment.78 At the same time, the ASG-I&S should insist, regardless
of CIC/NOS, that SC tackles over-classification as per NATO's security
policy and strives for the widest dissemination possible. As Adriana
Seagle observed, "**[Though a necessary security capability in the 21st
century networked world, the shift from "need to know" to "need to
share" has not been smooth]{.underline}**."79 Besides consensus on
internal sharing, the United States and other Member States will also
need to consider the usefulness of increased intelligence cooperation
with the EU. Finally, **[NATO's role in the growing international
intelligence exchange raises the question of democratic accountability
and calls for multinational]{.underline}** (administrative)
**[oversight]{.underline}**.80 It would appear that the ASG-I&S, on
behalf of the Member States, is the best alternative for addressing this
liability within the Alliance

#### 3\-\--[INFO-SHARING]{.underline} -- it's key to effective ASW and detection

The **[future of]{.underline}** **[anti-submarine warfare]{.underline}**
for countries who can't afford to invest in top-of-the-line submarines
and maritime patrol aircraft **[could be a netted fleet of unmanned
platforms]{.underline}** **[that]{.underline}** can **[create "passive
acoustic barriers" at chokepoints]{.underline}** or drag towed arrays
through a country's territorial waters. **[NATO's Centre for Maritime
Research and Experimentation is showcasing these ideas at NATO
exercises]{.underline}** such as the ongoing Dynamic Manta annual ASW
exercise, showing off novel operations **[that could one day be
commonplace if navies and their industrial bases decide to
invest]{.underline}**. CMRE Director Catherine Warner said the
organization has been working with autonomous vehicles in the undersea
warfare area for the past 20 years to understand how they can contribute
to perhaps the most complex type of naval warfare. "**[The big idea
in]{.underline}** this whole realm of **[unmanned systems
is]{.underline}** **[figuring out the right systems with the right
sensors and the right scenario that's going to be cost and operationally
effective]{.underline}**," she told USNI News after the kickoff of
Dynamic Manta. She said **[ASW is "high-end asset-intensive"
and]{.underline}** that, while unmanned vessels can't do everything a
manned sub or plane can, **[they can perform some specific missions that
would be cost-prohibitive to do with manned vehicles]{.underline}**.
**[One prime example is the passive acoustic barrier]{.underline}**.
Noting that CMRE puts passive sensors on all the autonomous vehicles,
buoys and seabed devices the organization puts in the water, Warner said
CMRE used all its sensors to demonstrate a passive acoustic barrier off
the coast of Sicily in the days leading up to the start of Dynamic
Manta. While in this demonstration they tracked the flow of commercial
ships across the "barrier," **[the ultimate idea would be to track the
movement of submarines at chokepoints such as the]{.underline}**
Greenland-Iceland-United Kingdom (**[GIUK) Gap]{.underline}**. **[The
specifics of the unmanned vehicle wouldn't matter as much
as]{.underline}** **[the quality of the sensor and the ability to
differentiate the clutter from the sounds of submarines.]{.underline}**
**[NATO]{.underline}** Centre for Maritime Research and Experimentation
(CMRE) graphic. On the more active side of sub-hunting, **[CMRE
has]{.underline}** been particularly **[focused on the idea of
multi-nation multistatic ASW]{.underline}**, **[where an active sonar
source would create pings for dozens or hundreds of passive sensors
listening for those sound waves to bounce off of enemy
submarines]{.underline}**. **[The more sensors that are in the water,
the better they can detect pings and recognize what kind of submarine is
moving through the water and in what direction]{.underline}**. During
Dynamic Manta, CMRE operated alongside manned warships to join in the
hunt for submarines, using its "network": NATO research vessel NRV
Alliance, two Ocean Explorer 21-inch diameter autonomous underwater
vehicles named Harpo and Groucho, and a fleet of Liquid Robotics' Wave
Gliders that serve as communication nodes between the ship and the AUVs.
Harpo and Groucho have a towed array to listen for pings, and more
recently CMRE developed a towed array for the Wave Gliders as well to
put more ears in the water. "**[Having that extra set of sensors makes a
huge difference]{.underline}**" in multistatic ASW, Warner said, because
when an active sonar source like the variable depth sonar on Alliance or
a warship like Italian frigate ITS Carabiniere (F 581) sends out energy,
they want as many passive sensors in the water as possible to listen for
pings. "**[When you do multistatic, there's so many more advantages
because of the geometry and the extra chances for
reflections]{.underline}**. **[So we can do it with ourselves, but if we
could do it with all the nations]{.underline}** -- and that is something
that we strive to do with our interaction with the nations ... --
**[then everybody, wherever they are, that has a sensor, being able to
know the sound source and sync to it and coordinate on the
reflections]{.underline}** -- it is very power to be able to do that."
**[The key to multi-nation multistatic ASW]{.underline}** **[is
information-sharing]{.underline}**: **[they'd all have to know where
exactly the active sonar source is]{.underline}**, **[so they could
correctly calculate what the pings they pick up mean]{.underline}**,
**[and t]{.underline}**hen they'd have to **[share what they're hearing
with all the other nations involved, too]{.underline}**, so **[they
could all adjust their positions as needed to get the best chance at
hearing the target submarine and help track it through the
water]{.underline}**. **[Info]{.underline}**rmation-**[sharing can be a
hurdle with something as sensitive as ASW]{.underline}**, **[with
nations often not wanting others to know the exact nature of their
capabilities]{.underline}**, **[but]{.underline}** Warner said **[the
scale to which NATO could track submarines under the water would be
powerful if everyone could find a way to come together]{.underline}**.
Today, Harpo and Groucho talk to each other while looking for subs, and
if one picks up a sound they will coordinate amongst themselves to get
into the best positions for the best geometries to hear sonar pings.
**[The more AUVS in the water collaborating, the better]{.underline}**.

Recommendation: **[Improve Information Sharing to Develop a Common
Undersea Operating Picture]{.underline}** One of the most potent
attributes of Russia's undersea capabilities is the strategic ambiguity
created by the submarine force. **[Many of the NATO and partner nations
in Northern Europe already possess relevant ASW
capabilities]{.underline}**, **[but they are not integrated to produce a
common undersea operating picture.]{.underline}** **[Developing allied
and partner information-sharing capabilities will help lift the veil on
Russia's undersea activities and decrease its coercive
power]{.underline}**. **[To achieve greater integration, NATO should
develop a transmission-agnostic, encrypted data standard for undersea
sensing data]{.underline}**. **[Data streams from static and mobile
sensors could]{.underline}** not only feed local assets but **[be
relayed to a shore-based NATO fusion center]{.underline}**, potentially
colocated with the ASW COE and aligned with the ASW-focused SNMG, to
provide analytic capability. **[For submarine operations, this
capability should include maintaining synchronized charts of allied and
partner submarine areas of operation]{.underline}**. Desired Effect:
Decreases the strategic ambiguity created by Russian undersea
capabilities. **[A common undersea operating picture can also help
ensure the resiliency of undersea infrastructure to minimize underwater
incidents and deconflict ASW operations]{.underline}**.

Accessed 7-1-2022, LASA-SC)

As Rishi Sunak's powerful report highlights, **[we have
allowed]{.underline}** this **[vital infrastructure]{.underline}**
**[of]{.underline}** **[undersea cables]{.underline}** **[to
grow]{.underline}** **[increasingly vulnerable]{.underline}**. **[This
should worry us all.]{.underline}** **[Cables are]{.underline}**
isolated **[in the midst of the oceans]{.underline}**, their locations
are known, **[and they are often subject to only]{.underline}**
**[minimal security]{.underline}** **[at on-shore landing
sites]{.underline}**. Furthermore, the **[technical capabilities
required to damage cables are relatively low]{.underline}** **[and
unsophisticated.]{.underline}** The risk posed to these **[garden
hose-thin connections]{.underline}** that **[carry]{.underline}**
everything from **[military]{.underline}**
**[intelligence]{.underline}** **[to]{.underline}** **[global financial
data]{.underline}** is real and growing. In the most severe scenario of
an **[all-out attack upon undersea cable]{.underline}** infrastructure
**[by a hostile actor]{.underline}** the impact of connectivity loss
**[is]{.underline}** potentially **[catastrophic]{.underline}**, but
**[even]{.underline}** relatively **[limited sabotage]{.underline}**
**[has the potential to]{.underline}** cause significant economic
disruption and **[damage military communications]{.underline}**. The
waters of the Atlantic have long symbolised the spirit of openness and
exploration and, today, the course once charted by the Mayflower is the
world's busiest digital sea-lane. But if that openness is to be
preserved, we must be prepared to act with both creativity and strength.
This Policy Exchange report accurately highlights the
**[Russian]{.underline}** **[dimension to this risk]{.underline}**. Over
my own career, I have seen the **[Atlantic transition from being a
theatre characterised by near complete NATO supremacy following the
collapse of the Soviet Union to a space that Russia is actively
contesting through a resurgent and revanchist naval
doctrine]{.underline}**. This rise in Russia's maritime assertiveness
has been well-documented and in many respects this bellicosity is a
symptom of weakness, attempting to deflect from domestic economic
failures that once led Senator John McCain to describe the Putin regime
as "a gas station masquerading as a country". But if the relative
weakness of the Russian position makes a conventional conflict with NATO
unlikely, it also raises the appeal of asymmetric targets like
fibre-optic cables. **[Recent reports make clear that Russian submarine
forces have undertaken detailed monitoring and targeting activities in
the vicinity of North Atlantic deep-sea cable
infrastructure]{.underline}**. And as another example of Russian
interest in asymmetric targets, it is worth remembering that in Crimea,
**[Russia successfully took control of land based communications
infrastructure early in its annexation of the peninsula]{.underline}**.
Russia's relative weakness also attracts it to conducting hybrid
warfare. The **[fundamental idea of hybrid warfare is hostile activity
that stops short of full, overt, offensive action and is sufficiently
ambiguous that it allows the aggressor plausible deniability and makes
international response more difficult]{.underline}**. Hybrid warfare has
traditionally been land-based, but as I have argued previously, **[this
is about to change and we should prepare for increased maritime hybrid
activity.]{.underline}** Chinese activities in the South China Sea and
Iranian actions in the Arabian Gulf already show characteristics of a
hybrid approach, using civilian vessels rather than easily identifiable
'gray hull' naval platforms to obfuscate the involvement of state
actors**[. Underwater cables are an obvious target for such hostile
action: they are a vital infrastructure asset with ambiguous protection
in international law that can be damaged with relatively
unsophisticated, non-military hardware.]{.underline}** The question that
this provokes is what we should do about it? The recommendations Mr
Sunak sets out in this report are a serious contribution to the field
and a welcome recognition of the precautions that nations like the UK
and the US must take in confronting risks posed to communications
infrastructure. **[As well as the actions each government must take
unilaterally to improve their security, there is much that can be
achieved through partnership]{.underline}**. Firstly, governments
working with private companies can build more redundancy into their
cable systems by creating more "dark cables" which are kept in reserve.
Secondly, **[NATO partners must collectively ready themselves to face
this new mix of naval tactics.]{.underline}** Where necessary, **[NATO
must be prepared to defend global submarine cables]{.underline}**,
**[exactly as we defend our electrical grid, industrial base and
transportation network]{.underline}**s. This **[will require highly
technical and capable undersea navies from allied countries, better used
to working together through regular joint exercises and operations. The
need for sea power is greater than ever.]{.underline}**

**[evade detection]{.underline}** in NATO's Dynamic Mongoose exercise,
the alliance said.

"Each surface ship will have the opportunity to conduct a variety of
submarine warfare operations. The submarines will take turns hunting and
being hunted, closely coordinating their efforts with the air and
surface participants," NATO Maritime Command said in a statement.
Maritime patrol aircraft will also take part.

The drill comes as **[NATO gives increased attention]{.underline}**
**[to the Arctic]{.underline}** and North Atlantic, **[where Russia
has]{.underline}** **[been building up a presence]{.underline}**, and
where melting sea ice will make it easier for commercial and military
vessels to operate in the future, allies have said.

**[Moscow has]{.underline}** "**[taken an]{.underline}** **[aggressive
approach]{.underline}** **[to the Arctic]{.underline}**," reoccupying
old Soviet bases and deploying air defense systems, the commander of
U.S. Naval Forces Europe-Africa, Adm. James Foggo said last week.

"**[We're seeing]{.underline}** a **[new area]{.underline}**
**[of]{.underline}** **[maritime competition]{.underline}** **[in the
Arctic]{.underline}**. Strong **[navies are needed to protect common
interests and ensure the timely flow of trade]{.underline}**," Foggo
said during a virtual speech Thursday for the International Institute
for Strategic Studies.

**[concerned]{.underline}** that **[Russian forces could]{.underline}**
**[damage undersea cables]{.underline}** **[that transmit most of the

While commanders involved in Dynamic Mongoose did not address such
concerns Monday, officials said the exercises are about preparing for a
"high-end" fight.

"**[Exercises today seize opportunities for NATO and Allied nations to
sharpen warfighting skills]{.underline}** by **[focusing on high-end
capabilities including Anti-Submarine Warfare]{.underline}**," said Vice
Adm. Keith Blount, head of NATO's Allied Maritime Command, in a
statement. "Dynamic Mongoose will **[ensure we remain prepared for
operations in peace, crisis and conflict]{.underline}**."

III\. THE **[RUSSIAN SUBMARINE THREAT TO NATO]{.underline}** A.
**[SUBMARINES IN RUSSIA'S STRATEGY]{.underline}** 15. **[Russia's
submarines must be placed in the context of the larger strategic
picture, as submarines play a vital role in]{.underline}** this respect.
**[Russia's]{.underline}** **[grand strategy]{.underline}** remains
**[to reclaim its status as a great power on the global
stage]{.underline}**. **[A key pillar]{.underline}** of this effort
**[is]{.underline}** a substantial military modernisation premised on
high levels of defence spending. Russia does not publish reliable,
transparent figures on this spending. According to one of the most
reliable estimates, the level of defence spending has fallen slightly
since its high point in 2015, when Russia spent 4.83% of its GDP on
defence. Still, in 2018, it remained high at 4% (IISS, 2019).
Regardless, Russian military spending, including on
**[submarines]{.underline}**, does not need to be high to achieve
effective asymmetric effects, as should become clear below. 16.
Alongside military modernisation, Russia continues to seek political and
military buffer zones in what it calls its 'near abroad'. For one,
**[Russia pursues hybrid and asymmetric tactics to create strategic
uncertainty and localised surprises]{.underline}** (Metrick and Hicks,
2018). Additionally, its leadership pursues targeted tactical overmatch
by creating anti-access/area-denial (A2/AD) 'bubbles' (Metrick and
Hicks, 2018). Russia's northern shores and the Baltic and Black Seas are
critical links in this A2/AD approach. 17. **[Russia's maritime
strategy]{.underline}** seeks to **[fulfil]{.underline}** several
fundamental goals, most prominently the **[provision]{.underline}** and
protection **[of]{.underline}** its **[submarine-based nuclear
deterrent]{.underline}**, the defence of its homeland, and increasing
Russia's power, influence, and economic strength (Allport, 2018). As an
important consequence, the Russian navy continues to prioritise a) the
**[replacement of its submarines equipped with nuclear
warheads]{.underline}**, b) **[strengthening its naval forces for
conventional anti-surface]{.underline}** 150 STC 19 E rev. 1 fin 4
warfare and land attack (Allport, 2018), **[and c) improving its
capabilities for asymmetric and maritime hybrid
operations.]{.underline}** 18. Overall, Russia's naval capabilities
still remain "vastly inferior to the collective power of the Alliance"
(Allport, 2018). As in other domains, Moscow seeks to compensate by
maximising its asymmetric strengths -- often to great effect. That is
one reason Russia also turns to maritime hybrid tactics, "to turn its
weak hand into a strong one", notes Admiral James G. Stavridis, former
NATO Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) (Stavridis, 2018). In
hybrid scenarios, Russia could employ the full range of military and
civilian capabilities and operate as ambiguously as possible (Stavridis,
2018). Submarines are well suited for hybrid tactics, as they can create
deniable effects and conduct seabed operations. 19. In particular,
**[Allied defence leaders have sounded warnings]{.underline}** **[that
Russia could tap or sever undersea communication cables]{.underline}**
(see Box 1 and Map 2). **[Its vessels have been spotted near these
cables]{.underline}**, perhaps to map the network. **[Although designed
with redundancy in mind, the tapping or severing of undersea
communication cables could be extremely consequential for transatlantic
and intra-European communications]{.underline}**. **[If
Russia]{.underline}** or any other state **[could tap into this
network,]{.underline}** **[it could covertly gain
intelligence]{.underline}** **[of strategic importance]{.underline}**,
for example on financial streams, trading data, and classified military
or government information. The **[international trading and financial
systems are critically dependent on this network]{.underline}**. **[A
disruption would have massive and immediate effects on economic
markets]{.underline}** (BBC, 2017; Stavridis, 2018). As Keir Giles, a
senior consulting fellow at Chatham House has argued, Russia has learnt
from its Crimea campaign: "physical access to the **[communications
infrastructure and telecommunications]{.underline}**" was the **[key to
information dominance]{.underline}** (BBC, 2017). 20. **[Currently, no
truly effective systems for monitoring undersea cable networks
exist]{.underline}** (Analytic Exchange Progam, 2017). **[Hence, a key
advantage of disrupting undersea cables lies in
deniability]{.underline}**. A 2008 incident illustrates this. No bad
actor was behind the **[near-simultaneous cutting of undersea
cables]{.underline}** from the Middle East to Europe and Asia. A ship
dragging an anchor and an undersea landslide were responsible. However,
if this **[happened to cables crucial for the Allies, how could they be
sure a state was behind this]{.underline}** (Smith and Hendrix, 2017)?
**[Even if one Ally had good intelligence, would it be able to share
enough]{.underline}** to convince others? **[And what would happen if
this took place at critical points in time]{.underline}**? One senior
interlocutor during the recent STCTTS visit to the United Kingdom said
that Russia could lay mines near these cables. If they were detonated at
the right time, **[the Alliance could lose a war before it would even
start]{.underline}**. **[It is time for NATO to come up with a good
answer.]{.underline}** 21. With Moscow's revived focus on submarines,
two classic Cold War concepts of operations have made a return when it
comes to the North Atlantic: 'bastions' and 'bastion defence' (Olsen,
2018). Bastions are those maritime zones where Russia concentrates its
at-sea nuclear deterrent. Naturally, Russia wants to keep these
strategic submarines safe and thus heavily protects these bastions.
Russia's European bastion is centred on its northern shores (see Map 3).
Beyond the bastion, a defensive perimeter of bastion defence stretches
all the way to the so-called Greenland-Iceland-UK gap (GIUK gap). One
reason the GIUK gap is important to Russia is the fact that, from this
line onwards, US assets equipped with Tomahawk cruise missiles can hit
vital targets in Russia (Allport, 2018). Russia cannot challenge the
Alliance for control of the North Atlantic (Olsen, 2018). Thus, Russian
naval assets, most importantly tactical submarines, would seek to deny
access to Allied vessels venturing beyond the gap in times of crisis or
war (Olsen, 2018). 22. Not every element of Russian maritime strategy,
naval modernisation, and operational activities should be seen as
inherently threatening. After all, the Russian military was at a
particularly low point when it initiated modernisation efforts.
Reasonable experts differ on whether Russia's evolving maritime posture
is defensively or offensively oriented. Some argue that Russia's
maritime strategy and posture is defensive at its core (Allport, 2018).
Others read Moscow's actions as geared towards the offensive (Olsen,
2018). 150 STC 19 E rev. 1 fin 5 23. The Rapporteur would agree with the
latter. One basic problem of Russia's strategy is that actions Russia
would (want to) perceive as defensive -- denying access beyond the GIUK
gap to protect its nuclear arsenal -- should be seen as a strategic
challenge to the Alliance -- threatening the transatlantic link. Box 1:
Notable quotes on the threat against undersea cables 24. Another element
in Russia's naval modernisation also points towards an offensively
oriented posture: the new Kalibr-3M14 long-range precision-guided
missiles which can target both surface vessels and land targets from as
far as 1,500 to 2,500 kilometres. As a result, **[Russian
submarines]{.underline}** **[not only present a threat to the
transatlantic link]{.underline}**; **[they can now also deny access to
Alliance littorals in support of the much broader A2/AD
threat]{.underline}** (Tamnes, 2018). Kalibr missiles could hold
critical nodes deep in Alliance territory at risk, even when on station
in the Barents and White Seas. Indeed, Russia has tested launching these
missiles from their home base, significantly reducing the time to launch
(O'Dwyer, 2019). If the upper estimate holds true, a submarine in the
White Sea could place a Kalibr on NATO Headquarters in Brussels and at
least 13 Allied capitals (see also Map 4). In a crisis or war, Russian

Columbia University, studying international relations and the political

**[Is]{.underline}** **[vital internet infrastructure]{.underline}**
**[at risk from]{.underline}** new **[Russian naval
capabilities]{.underline}**? **[NATO's]{.underline}** military
**[leadership]{.underline}** **[has warned]{.underline}** in recent
months **[that the Russian navy is aggressively]{.underline}**
**[probing undersea communications cable networks]{.underline}**.
**[These cables]{.underline}** form a global infrastructure system that
**[transmits]{.underline}** **[99 percent]{.underline}** **[of
the]{.underline}** international data sent over the
**[internet]{.underline}**. **[Should we be concerned]{.underline}**?
Despite the ominous warnings, defense officials have not provided much
specific information about the actual substance of the Russian threat.

**[In the worst scenario]{.underline}**, **[an attack that cut submarine
cables]{.underline}** coming into the United States
**[could]{.underline}** **[significantly harm]{.underline}** its access
to **[the global internet]{.underline}**. Ordinary users would probably
experience massive losses in bandwidth, particularly for services such
as Google and Facebook that host much of their data overseas.
**[Since]{.underline}** most **[government]{.underline}** also **[relies
on commercial internet infrastructure]{.underline}**, **[the outages
would also interrupt official communications]{.underline}**. **[Any data
hosted outside the U.S. would become nearly inaccessible to U.S. parties
and vice versa]{.underline}**. For people who depend on the internet in
daily life, such an attack would be a national disaster. But it is not
clear whether NATO believes Russia has the capability or the intention
of attacking cable networks in that fashion.

What is known about this problem can be broken down into four
categories: **[Russia's cable warfare capabilities, the Russian navy's
potential underwater targets, potential effects from damage to submarine
cables, and NATO's publicly acknowledged efforts to respond to
Russia.]{.underline}** In this post, I summarize existing information on
each of these and then pose outstanding questions about the potential
Russian threat. My earlier piece on Lawfare provides more background on
submarine cables as well as the international law protecting them.

**[Russia's]{.underline}** cable warfare **[capabilities]{.underline}**

**[Moscow]{.underline}** **[threatens]{.underline}** **[undersea
cables]{.underline}** primarily **[with]{.underline}**
**[submarines]{.underline}** and spy ships **[that deploy deep-sea
submersibles.]{.underline}** At DefenseOne, a national security news
site from Atlantic Media, Magnus Nordenman detailed how **[Russia has
converted ballistic missile subs to deploy the highly
secretive]{.underline}** AS-12 Losharik **[deep-sea
submarine]{.underline}**. The Losharik can dive down thousands of
meters, enabling it to target cables at depths that would be very
difficult to repair.

The most prominent Russian spy ship is the Yantar. Classified as an
\"oceanographic research vessel,\" the Yantar on its 2015 voyage probing
a cable route to Cuba provoked some of the first reporting that Russia
was targeting cables. That trip drew attention to the Yantar's
capabilities for intelligence operations. It carries advanced
surveillance equipment, including a remotely operated underwater vehicle
and two manned submersibles that the BBC reported can dive about 6,000
meters. For context, the average depth of the ocean floor is about 3,700
meters.

**[With all its advanced gear, the Yantar has been busy since it came
into service in 2015. The ship deployed off a U.S. submarine base in
Georgia in 2015]{.underline}**, **[located the wrecks of crashed Russian
fighter jets in the eastern Mediterranean in 2016 and assisted in the
search for a missing Argentine submarine in 2017.]{.underline}** The
Russian navy is scheduled to complete construction on a second
Yantar-class ship in 2019 and to begin building a third in 2020.

Former Guggenheim Fellow, Director of the Center for Science and Law, BA
@ Rice University; "Six Ways The Internet Will Save Civilization";
https://www.wired.co.uk/article/apocalypse-no\]

Many **[great [civilisations]{.mark} have
[fall]{.mark}en]{.underline}**, leaving nothing but cracked ruins and
scattered genetics. Usually this results
**[[from]{.underline}]{.mark}**: natural **[disasters, resource
depletion]{.underline}**, economic meltdown, **[disease, [poor
info]{.mark}rmation [flow]{.mark}]{.underline}** and corruption. **[But
we're luckier]{.underline}** than our predecessors **[because we
command]{.underline}** a technology that no one else possessed: **[a
rapid communication network that finds its highest expression in the
[internet]{.mark}]{.underline}**. I propose that there are six ways in
which **[the net has vastly reduced the threat of societal
collapse]{.underline}**.

**[Epidemics can be deflected by telepresence]{.underline}**

One of our more dire prospects for collapse is an infectious-disease
epidemic. **[Viral and bacterial epidemics precipitated the fall
of]{.underline}** the Golden Age of Athens, **[the Roman Empire
and]{.underline}** most of the empires of the **[Native Americans. The
internet can be our key to survival because the ability to work
telepresently can inhibit microbial transmission by reducing
human-to-human contact]{.underline}**. In the face of an otherwise
devastating epidemic, businesses can keep supply chains running with the
maximum number of employees working from home. This can reduce host
density below the tipping point required for an epidemic. If we are well
prepared when an epidemic arrives, **[we can fluidly shift into a
self-quarantined society]{.underline}** in which microbes fail due to
host scarcity. Whatever the social ills of isolation, they are worse for
the microbes than for us.

The internet will predict natural disasters

We are witnessing the downfall of slow central control in the media:
news stories are increasingly becoming user-generated nets of
up-to-the-minute information. During the recent California wildfires,
locals went to the TV stations to learn whether their neighbourhoods
were in danger. But the news stations appeared most concerned with the
fate of celebrity mansions, so Californians changed their tack: they
uploaded geotagged mobile-phone pictures, updated Facebook statuses and
tweeted. The balance tipped: **[the [internet carried
news]{.mark}]{.underline}** about the fire **[more quickly and
[accurately]{.mark}]{.underline}** than any news station could. In this
grass-roots, decentralised scheme, there were embedded reporters on
every block, and the news shockwave kept ahead of the fire. This head
start could provide the extra hours that save us. If the Pompeiians had
had the internet in 79AD, they could have easily marched 10km to safety,
well ahead of the pyroclastic flow from Mount Vesuvius. If the Indian
Ocean had the Pacific's networked tsunami-warning system, South-East
Asia would look quite different today.

Discoveries are retained and shared

**[Historically, critical information has required constant rediscovery.
Collections of learning]{.underline}** \-- from the library at
Alexandria to the entire Minoan civilisation \-- **[have fallen to the
bonfires of invaders or the wrecking ball of natural disaster. Knowledge
is]{.underline}** hard won but **[easily lost]{.underline}**. And
information that survives often does not spread. Consider smallpox
inoculation: this was under way in India, China and Africa centuries
before it made its way to Europe. By the time the idea reached North
America, native civilisations who needed it had already collapsed.
**[The net solved the problem. [New discoveries catch on
immediately]{.mark}; information spreads widely]{.underline}**. In this
way, societies can optimally ratchet up, using the latest bricks of
knowledge in their fortification against risk.

**[[Tyranny is mitigated]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Censorship of ideas was a familiar spectre in the last century, with
state-approved news outlets ruling the press, airwaves and copying
machines in the USSR, Romania, Cuba, China, Iraq and elsewhere. In many
cases, such as Lysenko's agricultural despotism in the USSR, it directly
contributed to the collapse of the nation. Historically, a more
successful strategy has been to confront free speech with free speech
\-- and the internet allows this in a natural way. It democratises the
flow of information by offering access to the newspapers of the world,
the photographers of every nation, the bloggers of every political
stripe. Some posts are full of doctoring and dishonesty whereas others
strive for independence and impartiality \-- but all are available to us
to sift through. Given the attempts by some governments to build
firewalls, it's clear that this benefit of the net requires constant
vigilance.

**[Human capital is vastly increased]{.underline}**

**[Crowdsourcing brings people together to solve problems. Yet far fewer
than one per cent of the world's population is involved. We need expand
human capital]{.underline}**. Most of the world not have access to the
education afforded a small minority. For every Albert Einstein, Yo-Yo Ma
or Barack Obama who has educational opportunities, uncountable others do
not. This squandering of talent translates into reduced economic output
and a smaller pool of problem solvers. The net opens the gates education
to anyone with a computer. A motivated teen anywhere on the planet can
walk through the world's knowledge \-- from the webs of Wikipedia to the
curriculum of MIT's OpenCourseWare. The new **[[human capital]{.mark}
will [serve us]{.mark} well when [we confront existential
threats]{.mark} we've never imagined before]{.underline}**.

Energy expenditure is reduced

Societal collapse can often be understood in terms of an energy budget:
when energy spend outweighs energy return, collapse ensues. This has
taken the form of deforestation or soil erosion; currently, the worry
involves fossil-fuel depletion. The internet addresses the energy
problem with a natural ease. **[Consider the massive energy
savings]{.underline}** inherent in the shift from paper to electrons \--
as seen in the transition from the post to email. Ecommerce reduces the
need to drive long distances to purchase products. Delivery trucks are
more eco-friendly than individuals driving around, not least because of
tight packaging and optimisation algorithms for driving routes. Of
course, there are energy costs to the banks of computers that underpin
the internet \-- but these costs are less than the wood, coal and oil
that would be expended for the same quantity of information flow.

The tangle of events that triggers societal collapse can be complex, and
there are several threats the net does not address. But **[vast,
networked [communication]{.mark} can be an [antidote to]{.mark} several
of the most deadly [diseases threatening
civilisation]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The next time your coworker laments
internet addiction, the banality of tweeting or the decline of
face-to-face conversation, you may want to suggest that the net may just
be the technology that saves us.

That **[combination remains the key to sea power today]{.underline}**,
**[dominated by the]{.underline}** **[U.S. Navy]{.underline}**, with 68
nuclear-powered submarines, 11 aircraft carriers, and more than 450
other ships like destroyers, cruisers, and support ships.

**[In recent years]{.underline}**, **[China]{.underline}** **[has
overtaken the U.S. in numbers, with more than 500 ships]{.underline}**,
**[including 75 submarines and three aircraft carriers, of which about

**[China's]{.underline}** **[open-ocean naval capability

in the world comes close to the U.S. or China. **[Now a new era in naval
power is emerging]{.underline}** --- **[unmanned
vehicles]{.underline}**.

Nearly two decades into the 21st Century, **[both nations are
putting]{.underline}** **[significant effort]{.underline}** **[into
adding autonomous and semi-autonomous platforms to their surface and
subsurface naval forces]{.underline}**. The **[underwater
realm]{.underline}** is the most difficult because of the limitations of
underwater communications, which **[makes]{.underline}** **[some form of
artificial intelligence]{.underline}** (AI) **[mandatory]{.underline}**.

China has been uncharacteristically open about its intentions for AI,
from an announced underwater city inhabited and operated entirely by
robots to official government goals of capitalizing on AI to transform
their military into the strongest in the world.

While **[Chinese government spending on AI research is far
greater]{.underline}** **[than that of the U.S]{.underline}**., however,
a large percentage of global effort is coming from the U.S. commercial
sector, on which the Pentagon relies heavily for technology advances.
Still, **[Chinese companies also are increasing their AI
investments.]{.underline}**

The **[influence of massive spending]{.underline}** **[on]{.underline}**
developing **[AI for undersea systems portends the greatest change in
military sea power since the introduction of nuclear-powered
vessels.]{.underline}**

"Equipping our military vessels with a higher-level of artificial
intelligence is the answer to the increasing size and complexity of data
to be processed as well as the need to reduce staff," says Dominique
Giannoni, an executive at Thales Underwater Systems in Valbonne, France.

**[China]{.underline}** **[autonomous undersea]{.underline}**
**[efforts]{.underline}**

In a rare July 2018 interview with the South **[China]{.underline}**
Morning Post, Lin Yang, director of a classified program at the Shenyang
Institute of Automation in Shenyang, China, says her country has
**[plans to develop new-generation military underwater
robots]{.underline}** by 2021. His 912 Project's goal is to develop
AI-driven unmanned submarines to handle surveillance, mine laying, and
attack missions.

Western China-watchers say the **[Chinese navy has several AI-enabled
vessels]{.underline}** in development --- **[with a focus on autonomous
submarines]{.underline}** --- as **[part of a major push to overtake
U.S. dominance in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond.]{.underline}**
That includes 100-foot long extra-large unmanned underwater vehicles
(XLUUVs) intended for deployment early in the next decade.

Another civilian project is China's most ambitious undersea AI effort to
date, with significant military potential. In **[2018, China announced
it was working on an AI-run underwater base, equipped with autonomous
submarines to extend its reach]{.underline}**.

According to published reports, the **[submarines would deploy for
investigation and scientific surveillance missions, then return to the
unmanned base to download data and recharge]{.underline}**. The base
itself, located on the ocean floor as deep as 36,000 feet, also would
conduct research on the immediate area, process and fuse all collected
data, and transmit the results to a surface ship or land station.

No location for the base or a timetable for its deployment have been
released, but, given the speed with which China is developing AI across
the board, and especially for undersea applications, the first elements
are expected in the near future.

While being promoted as a major advance in research on undersea life and
topography**[, the military potential of such long-endurance unmanned
cooperative systems cannot be ignored.]{.underline}**

**[China must]{.underline}** "grasp the changes of national security
circumstances, **[speed up preparations for military
struggl]{.underline}**e, including battle planning, **[capacity building
and command system building]{.underline}**," Chinese President Xi
Jinping said in a speech during a naval inspection in Qingdao, China,
according to China Daily.

**[Russia also is putting considerable effort into AI]{.underline}**,
but is not believed to be anywhere near the level of the U.S. or China.

**[U.S]{.underline}**. autonomous undersea **[programs]{.underline}**

The 2020 Pentagon budget request cites advances of potential adversaries
in asking for major funding increases for autonomous weapons programs.
Requests include a **[ten-fold increase in spending on large unmanned
surface vessels]{.underline}** by the Navy and more than 50 percent more
for Army robotics development. The requests total \$3.7 billion on
unmanned systems across the services, plus another \$900 million on AI.

The Embracing Artificial Intelligence in Undersea Warfare session at the
Navy Submarine League's Submarine Technology Symposium in May summarized
the U.S. Navy's increasing focus on AI --- especially undersea:

"**[As the current submarine force trusts mechanical and electrical
technology to execute the mission]{.underline}**, **[the future force
will need to trust AI]{.underline}** **[to extract and exploit
actionable patterns among an ocean of data]{.underline}**," the session
says. "The advent of big data and deep learning technology has rendered
signal detection and classification an increasingly automated process.
**[Furthermore, advances in autonomous navigation have enabled unmanned
platforms to operate alone or in swarms.]{.underline}**

"**[It will be]{.underline}** **[critical]{.underline}** for the 21st
century **[that the undersea fleet advance in its AI
capabilities]{.underline}**, **[develop algorithms that are intuitive
and explainable, cultivate users' trust in AI]{.underline}**,
**[and]{.underline}** **[design]{.underline}** **[future
systems]{.underline}** **[around the use of AI]{.underline}**.
Meanwhile, we must also recognize our adversaries' disruptive AI
capabilities and develop appropriate countermeasures against them."

**[Despite]{.underline}** technological **[strides]{.underline}**
**[in]{.underline}** **[AI]{.underline}**, **[unmanned maritime vessels
face a host of new and potentially disabling challenges]{.underline}**
--- **[especially in underwater applications]{.underline}**. A 2014 Rand
Corp. research paper on Designing Unmanned Systems with Greater Autonomy
looked at how AI is being implemented --- and researched for future
application --- across the board for unmanned systems. The report also
noted the unique challenges facing UUV autonomy.

"**[Achieving]{.underline}** and maintaining
**[communication]{.underline}** **[with underwater
vehicles]{.underline}** and even with surface vehicles
**[is]{.underline}** technically **[challenging]{.underline}**,
especially at longer ranges. **[Water attenuates radio waves and other
wireless signals that can easily be used at long range in air-to-ground
or air-to-air communications]{.underline}**," the report stated. "This
means that high-bandwidth communications underwater are largely
impractical using traditional communication technologies."

"Although there has been some experimentation with laser communications
for underwater applications, laser communications systems are expensive
and consume considerable amounts of power. **[Because of these
communications limitations, UUVs that do not require continuous
communications links are essential]{.underline}**. For example,
**[autonomous path planning is needed to avoid underwater obstacles and
unanticipated terrain features."]{.underline}**

(ASEAN) Criteria for Partnership: Optimal data-sharing partners would be
countries that widely collect and publish data for public use, and
countries where that data is stored and accessible by third parties. To
assess capability and compatibility, we selected metrics reflecting the
amount of data that allied and partner governments generate and capture.
We included data from the Open Knowledge Foundation's Global Open Data
Index, which measures the volume and types of publicly available
government data, such as national statistics, procurement practices, air
quality and weather information, and company registry information.56 We
also included the number of data processing centers in each country and
the gross value of imported data storage units.57 While it is difficult
to determine what kind of data they store or how much storage capacity
they have, the dollar value of data processing and storage centers is a
reasonable proxy for national data capacity and reflects the amount of
data generated by entities in each country. Moreover, we featured three
indicators from the CSET survey: expressed interest in data sharing with
the United States, whether the country has taken actions to enhance data
archival procedures, and whether it has established data use standards.
20 Center for Security and Emerging Technology Finally, we compared
legal environments in each country as they pertain to data sharing.58
Although all the countries listed in Table 5 fall under the jurisdiction
of the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), they have no
apparent localization requirements, nor do they prevent the transfer of
certain classes of data across borders.59 Moreover, shared data
standards under the GDPR may make it easier for the United States to
collect the same kind of data from multiple countries in the future.
Other considerations and caveats: Other high-scoring countries include
South Korea, Finland, Denmark, Lithuania, Latvia, and the Czech
Republic. The United States would do well to diversify its sources of
data, including from countries beyond the jurisdiction of the GDPR.
India, for example, boasts a large population, vibrant technology
market, and high concentration of data processing facilities Initiative
5: Invest in privacy-preserving machine learning. To protect individual
privacy, the United States and its allies and partners should explore
techniques in data analysis that would allow them to perform operations
on non-sensitive data sets without sharing or storing personally
identifiable information. These techniques are known as
privacy-preserving machine learning. Researchers Roxanne Heston and
Helen Toner observe that privacy-preserving machine learning could make
"new uses of AI possible without triggering privacy concerns, give U.S.
companies a competitive edge over their foreign counterparts, and/or
reduce cybersecurity risks by protecting individual data while
preserving its usefulness."60 Applications of privacy-preserving machine
learning could include performing object and facial recognition locally
on an individual's phone instead of processing that data in the cloud,
thereby improving security and privacy; employing differential privacy
models to obscure the identities of individuals in census research; and
using secure multi-party computation to combat tax fraud.61 Coordinated
investment initiatives in homomorphic encryption, secure multi-party
computation, and federated learning would enable democratic,
market-based economies to benefit from larger and more diverse pools of
data without compromising the privacy of individual users and
organizations whose data are in the pools. U.S. allies and partners are
especially willing to collaborate on this front. Nearly all surveyed
officials indicated interest in collaborating on an international
certification scheme for the protection of personal data, with
two-thirds of surveyed officials indicating high interest. As
Australia's AI Ethics Framework notes, "Throughout their lifecycle, AI
systems should respect and uphold privacy rights and data protection,
and ensure the security of data."62 The United States and its allies
should discuss potential use cases where privacy-preserving machine
learning could be developed and deployed, coordinate research and
development priorities that further applications suitable to these
technologies, and create guidelines and technical standards to promote
safe and reliable applications in realistic scenarios.63 More broadly,
the United States and its allies should co-fund research and coordinate
investments into new techniques, such as synthetic data, advanced
simulations, and improvements in transfer learning, for making personal
data less relevant to AI systems. Optimal Partners: Canada, India,
Germany, Australia, Japan, and the United Kingdom Multilateral Fora: EU,
OECD, the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (India, Japan, Australia, and
the United States), National Institute of Standards and Technologyand
National Science Foundation (NSF)-led bilateral and multilateral
partnerships 22 Center for Security and Emerging Technology Criteria for
Partnership: The United States should coordinate with countries whose
scientists produce most of the world's cutting-edge AI research focused
on privacy and anonymity, such as homomorphic encryption and federated
learning techniques. Ideal partners would also respect online privacy
and share U.S. concerns about digital illiberalism. To measure
countries' relative strengths in privacy-preserving machine learning, we
counted the number of patents and scientific publications from
scientists affiliated with local research institutions. We only assessed
patents and publications labeled as relevant to artificial intelligence
and computer vision applications that explicitly mention "privacy" or
"anonymity."64 We included Freedom House's scores of internet freedom in
each country as a proxy for governments' commitments to democratic
values and civil liberties.65 We also aggregated four measures from the
CSET survey to capture countries' focus on privacy: expressed interest
in an international scheme for the protection of personal data,
government action taken to enhance privacy protections, perceptions of
the need for international management of facial recognition, and the
country's likelihood of regulating surveillance technology. Other
considerations and caveats: France and South Korea produce a large
number of AI patents related to privacy and score highly on Freedom on
the Net. U.S. policymakers could also consider partnering with
individual tech companies abroad to further privacy-preserving research
projects. The frequency of the phrase "privacy" in national AI
strategies is a crude measure: India and the United Kingdom score "0,"
for example, but both countries are likely deeply concerned about
privacy issues Initiative 6: **[Promote interoperability and agile
software development. [Interoperability is a critical lubricant for U.S.
alliances]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[To operate effectively, allies need
to plan, train, and exercise together]{.underline}**. Joint operational

and its allies could use this fund to more efficiently procure
commercial cloud computing technology. The United States, United
Kingdom, and Canada, for example, could agree to bid out a bulk purchase
of cloud compute from major technology companies and distribute access
to compute in the form of credits and publicly funded research. This
initiative would ensure that democratic nations benefit from techniques
in machine learning that require fewer inputs of real-world data but
greater computational power to run simulations and self-play methods.
Representatives from Japan, South Korea, the Czech Republic, Lithuania,
and the EU each cited increased computing as an AI R&D priority,
suggesting an area for aligning focus among allies.

//um-ef)

The **[future of]{.underline}** **[anti-submarine warfare]{.underline}**
for countries who can't afford to invest in top-of-the-line submarines
and maritime patrol aircraft **[could be a netted fleet of unmanned
platforms]{.underline}** **[that]{.underline}** can **[create "passive
acoustic barriers" at chokepoints]{.underline}** or drag towed arrays
through a country's territorial waters. **[NATO's Centre for Maritime
Research and Experimentation is showcasing these ideas at NATO
exercises]{.underline}** such as the ongoing Dynamic Manta annual ASW
exercise, showing off novel operations **[that could one day be
commonplace if navies and their industrial bases decide to
invest]{.underline}**. CMRE Director Catherine Warner said the
organization has been working with autonomous vehicles in the undersea
warfare area for the past 20 years to understand how they can contribute
to perhaps the most complex type of naval warfare. "**[The big idea
in]{.underline}** this whole realm of **[unmanned systems
is]{.underline}** **[figuring out the right systems with the right
sensors and the right scenario that's going to be cost and operationally
effective]{.underline}**," she told USNI News after the kickoff of
Dynamic Manta. She said **[ASW is "high-end asset-intensive"
and]{.underline}** that, while unmanned vessels can't do everything a
manned sub or plane can, **[they can perform some specific missions that
would be cost-prohibitive to do with manned vehicles]{.underline}**.
**[One prime example is the passive acoustic barrier]{.underline}**.
Noting that CMRE puts passive sensors on all the autonomous vehicles,
buoys and seabed devices the organization puts in the water, Warner said
CMRE used all its sensors to demonstrate a passive acoustic barrier off
the coast of Sicily in the days leading up to the start of Dynamic
Manta. While in this demonstration they tracked the flow of commercial
ships across the "barrier," **[the ultimate idea would be to track the
movement of submarines at chokepoints such as the]{.underline}**
Greenland-Iceland-United Kingdom (**[GIUK) Gap]{.underline}**. **[The
specifics of the unmanned vehicle wouldn't matter as much
as]{.underline}** **[the quality of the sensor and the ability to
differentiate the clutter from the sounds of submarines.]{.underline}**
**[NATO]{.underline}** Centre for Maritime Research and Experimentation
(CMRE) graphic. On the more active side of sub-hunting, **[CMRE
has]{.underline}** been particularly **[focused on the idea of
multi-nation multistatic ASW]{.underline}**, **[where an active sonar
source would create pings for dozens or hundreds of passive sensors
listening for those sound waves to bounce off of enemy
submarines]{.underline}**. **[The more sensors that are in the water,
the better they can detect pings and recognize what kind of submarine is
moving through the water and in what direction]{.underline}**. During
Dynamic Manta, CMRE operated alongside manned warships to join in the
hunt for submarines, using its "network": NATO research vessel NRV
Alliance, two Ocean Explorer 21-inch diameter autonomous underwater
vehicles named Harpo and Groucho, and a fleet of Liquid Robotics' Wave
Gliders that serve as communication nodes between the ship and the AUVs.
Harpo and Groucho have a towed array to listen for pings, and more
recently CMRE developed a towed array for the Wave Gliders as well to
put more ears in the water. "**[Having that extra set of sensors makes a
huge difference]{.underline}**" in multistatic ASW, Warner said, because
when an active sonar source like the variable depth sonar on Alliance or
a warship like Italian frigate ITS Carabiniere (F 581) sends out energy,
they want as many passive sensors in the water as possible to listen for
pings. "**[When you do multistatic, there's so many more advantages
because of the geometry and the extra chances for
reflections]{.underline}**. **[So we can do it with ourselves, but if we
could do it with all the nations]{.underline}** -- and that is something
that we strive to do with our interaction with the nations ... --
**[then everybody, wherever they are, that has a sensor, being able to
know the sound source and sync to it and coordinate on the
reflections]{.underline}** -- it is very power to be able to do that."
**[The key to multi-nation multistatic ASW]{.underline}** **[is
information-sharing]{.underline}**: **[they'd all have to know where
exactly the active sonar source is]{.underline}**, **[so they could
correctly calculate what the pings they pick up mean]{.underline}**,
**[and t]{.underline}**hen they'd have to **[share what they're hearing
with all the other nations involved, too]{.underline}**, so **[they
could all adjust their positions as needed to get the best chance at
hearing the target submarine and help track it through the
water]{.underline}**. **[Info]{.underline}**rmation-**[sharing can be a
hurdle with something as sensitive as ASW]{.underline}**, **[with
nations often not wanting others to know the exact nature of their
capabilities]{.underline}**, **[but]{.underline}** Warner said **[the
scale to which NATO could track submarines under the water would be
powerful if everyone could find a way to come together]{.underline}**.
Today, Harpo and Groucho talk to each other while looking for subs, and
if one picks up a sound they will coordinate amongst themselves to get
into the best positions for the best geometries to hear sonar pings.
**[The more AUVS in the water collaborating, the better]{.underline}**.

WMK

45\. The principal purpose of ASW is to find a potential adversary's
submarines in a game of 'cat and mouse' (Perkins, 2016). Given the
difficulty of the task, **[ASW depends on high-end military
capabilities,]{.underline}** but as former US Chief of Naval Operations
Admiral Gary Roughead aptly notes, it is also "a mix of art and science"
(Roughead, 2018). Modern ASW mainly relies on a variety of manned
platforms **[utilising]{.underline}** passive and active **[sonar
systems]{.underline}** (see Box 3 and Table 3): - tactical submarines; -
fixed-wing maritime patrol aircraft (MPA); - surface vessels equipped
with sonar systems; - maritime ASW helicopters based on land or on
surface vessels; and - acoustic detection systems on the seabed or
installed on shore.

46\. **[NATO's]{.underline}** **[overall ability to conduct high-end ASW
operations]{.underline}** **[has]{.underline}** **[atrophied
substantiall]{.underline}**y. A 2017 tabletop exercise, led by a
renowned think tank, found that "**[neither the individual member
states, nor the Alliance as a whole]{.underline}**, **[presently possess
the ability to conduct a comprehensive and coordinated anti-submarine
warfare campaign]{.underline}** **[under either peacetime or wartime
conditions"]{.underline}** (Smith and Hendrix, 2017). One of the
participants argued that it would take 50 days or more to assemble an
effective ASW force. **[While NATO still retains the capability to
prosecute individual submarines]{.underline}** atv the current level of
Russian patrols, **[it will soon lose this ability if current trends
continue]{.underline}** (Perkins, 2016). In short, the Alliance **[has
"ceded much of the advantage it earned at the conclusion of the Cold
War]{.underline}**" (Perkins, 2016).

47\. **[NATO]{.underline}** faces a twin problem. For one, its own
**[ASW capabilities]{.underline}** **[have]{.underline}**
**[withered]{.underline}**, **[as the number of ASW-capable platforms
has fallen]{.underline}**, in some areas radically. Moreover, **[the
capabilities the Alliance still possesses]{.underline}** **[are rapidly
ageing and encounter interoperability problem]{.underline}**s (Hicks et
al., 2016). At the same time, **[the submarine capabilities of near-peer
competitors have increased significantly]{.underline}**, even if they
cannot best the most modern Allied submarines.

48\. Several reasons explain but do not excuse this state of affairs. As
the immediate threat of the Soviet Union waned in the early 1990s,
defence budgets began to shrink substantially. They took another big hit
after the financial crisis of 2007/2008. More importantly perhaps, a
strategic reorientation towards expeditionary warfare took place after
the Cold War ended. While based on sound reasons, this reorientation
came at a high price for other capability areas, including ASW (Perkins,
2016; Allport, 2018; Hudson and Roberts, 2018): - naval vessels
conducted more and more generic maritime security or were repurposed for
land attack missions; - MPAs increasingly focused on wider intelligence,
surveillance, and reconnaissance; - ASW-capable vessels almost ceased
operating in the North Atlantic and Arctic Oceans; and - some Allies
chose not to replace certain capabilities at the end of their lifetime.

49\. One area where Allies have retained robust capabilities, including
through timely replacement programmes, is maritime ASW helicopters.
Acoustic detection systems installed on the seabed or on shore are
highly classified systems, thus little information is available. Some
experts have stated that the United States has likely placed its large
underwater Sound Surveillance System near the GIUK gap in standby (Smith
and Hendrix, 2017). Experts also question its ability to detect the
quietest Russian submarines. The US Navy is pursuing upgrades and new
systems, but little is publicly known. Allied inventories of tactical
submarines, MPAs, and frigates either continue to face significant
shortfalls today or will in the near future. It is thus worth
highlighting the ongoing modernisation efforts in this regard.

B. TACTICAL SUBMARINES: HIGH QUALITY, MIXED PICTURE OVERALL

50\. The 124 tactical submarines currently available in Europe and North
America still possess superior qualities compared to non-NATO
submarines, with the US submarines remaining at the top of the class.
Nevertheless, quantity counts in ASW, and it is therefore regrettable
that the total number of submarines in the Alliance has fallen
drastically. A few examples illustrate this (Hicks et al., 2016): -
Denmark did not replace its last submarines when they reached the end of
their lifetime in 2004. - Germany's submarine numbers fell from 14 to 6
between 2000 and 2019 (-57%). - Norway went from 10 to 7 between 2000
and 2019 (-30%). - The United Kingdom dropped from 12 to 6 between 2000
and 2019 (-50%). - Even the United States possesses almost 10% fewer
submarines than at the end of the Cold War.

51\. The positive news is that **[all Allies with submarine fleets are
committed]{.underline}** to **[maintaining this
capability.]{.underline}** The most important submarine modernisation
programmes include the following: - Canada's new 2017 Defence Policy
committed to modernising its Victoria class submarines in the mid-2020s
to ensure their continued effectiveness into the mid-2030s (Government
of Canada, 2017). So far, the option analysis has been completed
(Government of Canada, 2019). The country purchased these submarines in
1998 from the United Kingdom, where they had entered service in the
early 1990s. - The four Walrus class submarines of the Netherlands need
to be replaced in the second half of the 2020s. The country is set to
decide on a follow-on procurement programme by the second half of 2019
(Sprenger, 2019a). To replace its Rubis class submarines, France is in
the process of building Barracuda class nuclear-powered general-purpose
submarines (Sprenger, 2019b). Six are planned (Sprenger, 2019b). The
first of these submarines, the Suffren, was launched in July 2019 and is
expected to be delivered in 2020 (Sprenger, 2019b). - Germany's
diesel-electric Type 212 submarines boast some of the most advanced
air-independent propulsion technology in the world. The German navy will
add another two to its fleet in the coming years under a joint programme
with Norway (NavalToday.com, 2019). - Italy plans to procure another
four German-designed Type 212 submarines to remain at eight submarines
once its four Pelosi class submarines retire (Kington, 2019). - Norway's
six Ula class submarines will reach the end of their lifespan in the
mid- to late-2020s. They will be replaced by submarines based on the
German Type 212 class under a joint programme with Germany
(NavalToday.com, 2019). - Poland's submarines are deemed not
combat-relevant by experts (Hicks et. Al, 2016). However, the country
has committed to procuring new ones and initiated a competition for the
programme (Lesiecki, 2018). - Spain's S-80 Plus class programme has run
into severe problems, forcing the country to maintain its S-70 Agosta
class submarines, which entered service in the early 1980s, in service
longer than expected (Roblin, 2018). - Turkey has launched a mid-life
upgrade for its four Preveze class submarines (Vavasseur, 2019b). - The
UK Royal Navy is in the process of replacing the Trafalgar class
submarines with the highly capable Astute class submarines. Three Astute
submarines are already in service (UK Royal Navy, n.d.). The Ministry of
Defence has already launched a Maritime Underwater Future Capability
project for the time when the Astute class will leave service (Bliddal,
2019). - While the United States is accelerating its submarine
procurement, it will still face a tactical-submarine shortfall in the
mid-2020s, when their number will bottom out at about 42 (McLeary,
2019). This prospect is likely a driving factor in the accelerated
acquisition of maritime unmanned systems (see next section).

C. MARITIME PATROL AIRCRAFT: A KEY SHORTFALL AREA

52\. The capability shortfall in Maritime Patrol Aircraft (MPAs) for ASW
missions has been especially dramatic. Compared to the end of the Cold
War, the Alliance now possesses 120 fewer MPAs (Perkins, 2016). One data
point illustrates what this really means: while the ratio of available
Allied MPAs to Soviet submarines was about 1.8 to 1 at the end of the
1980s, the ratio has more than inversed at 1 Allied MPA for 2 Russian
submarines (Perkins, 2016). While MPAs are certainly expensive assets,
they cannot be replaced solely by a layered federated system of sensors
(Perkins, 2016). Indeed, to maintain 24-hour coverage of a single
submarine, a country needs about seven to eight MPAs (Perkins, 2016).

53\. The majority of the Allies' MPAs will reach the end of their
operational lives in the 2025-2035 timeframe. As one industry
interlocutor put it during the recent STCTTS visit to the United
Kingdom, the Alliance is facing a "15-year crunch time". They have
realised the urgency of this challenge. Indeed, eight Allies have
pursued a Multinational Maritime Multi Mission Aircraft Capabilities
Cooperation under NATO's aegis since 2017 (see Figure 1). They have
begun to define common requirements for such future aircraft
capabilities, with ASW very much at the centre.

54\. Individual Allies are already in the process of procuring new
MPAs: - France and Germany have declared their intent to work together
in replacing their MPA fleets in a broader European project (Shalal,
2018). - Norway is replacing its P-3C Orion fleet with five P-8 Poseidon
MPAs (Reim, 2019). I taly's new ATR-72 MPAs are not configured for ASW,
but the airframe could, in principle, be upgraded with this capability
in the future (Kington, 2016). - Turkey intends to procure six ATR-72
MPAs with ASW capabilities (Aviation News, 2016). - The United Kingdom
currently finds itself in a severe situation. In 2011, its Nimrod MPAs
were not replaced. This has left the United Kingdom without an MPA
capability and dependent on Allied support in the face of increased
submarine activity along its shores. The government is therefore
acquiring nine P-8 Poseidon MPAs. The first of these is set to move to
the United Kingdom in early 2020, and the last aircraft is expected to
be delivered by March 2022 (US DOD, 2019b).

55\. Another MPA-related shortfall is the very low level of sonobuoys,
which MPAs (and ASW helicopters) drop into the sea to hunt submarines
(Perkins, 2016). While these depleted inventories alone should be a
cause for alarm, the situation is made worse by the fact that
significantly more sonobuoys are now needed to achieve Cold War-levels
of detection because submarines have become much quieter (Perkins,
2016). Their utility has certainly been falling. However, in the short
to medium term, they are still very much needed to locate submarines in
a dynamic hunt, as newer technologies are not yet capable of fully
compensating -- and will not be within the next decade or two (see next
section). Allies must therefore urgently build up stockpiles. Perhaps a
NATO Smart Defence project similar to the joint procurement of
precision-guided munitions could be explored. Indeed, Allies can already
place sonobuoy orders through the NATO Support and Procurement Agency.

D. ONGOING FRIGATE MODERNISATION ACROSS THE ALLIANCE

56\. The ASW capabilities on surface vessels have not fallen quite as
drastically, but certain Allies have seen significant reductions. For
example, the Atlantic-facing NATO member states, who carry the brunt of
the ASW burden on NATO's northern flank, lost about half of their
frigate inventory between 1995 and 2017 (Smith and Hendrix, 2017). Even
the United States faces difficulties. The US Navy is cutting the number
of vessels equipped with the Surveillance Towed Array Sensor System from
nine to five, possesses no frigate class specially dedicated to ASW, and
lost ASW capabilities when the S-3 Viking fixed-wing aircraft retired
from carriers in 2009 (Smith and Hendrix, 2017).

57\. **[Allies are well aware of the need for high-end
ASW]{.underline}** surface vessels and are reacting accordingly.
Importantly, 12 Allies are in the process of procuring new frigates,
with many of these being designed for improved ASW capabilities. Some of
the modernisation programmes most relevant to ASW include the
following: - Belgium and the Netherlands are developing a new Future
Surface Combatant to replace the M-Frigates in their inventory
(Fiorenza, 2018). The first new frigate should be delivered to the
Netherlands by the mid-2020s (Naval Recognition, 2018). - In a sign that
Canada takes the ASW threat seriously, its government has selected the
Type 26 frigate, designed in the United Kingdom and optimised for ASW,
to replace its Halifax class frigates (Allison, 2018). - Six of France's
new FREMM frigates have been ASW optimised, with the last frigate
delivered in July 2019 (OCCAR, 2019). Moreover, a number of older
frigates will be retrofitted with towed array sensors (Hicks et al.,
2016). - Germany's MKS-180 frigates, which are under development, will
have an advanced ASW module option (Vavasseur, 2019a). - The United
Kingdom will replace its Type 23 frigates, which are highly capable of
ASW operations, with the new Type 26 class optimised for ASW (Willett,
2018). However, it has cut its planned orders from 13 to 8 (Willett,
2018). - The United States will design its new FFG(X) frigate with
excellent ASW capabilities in mind. The US Navy wants to procure 20
FFG(X) by 2030, with the first frigate of this type procured in 2020
(Congressional Research Service, 2019).

VI\. TOWARDS A NEW VISION FOR ASW

58\. The previous section laid out some of the short- and medium-term
challenges to the Alliance's ASW capabilities as well as some ways
Allies plan to rebuild them. However**[, in the longer
term,]{.underline}** **[much more]{.underline}** **[complex challenges
abound]{.underline}**. On the one hand, the **[seas are becoming louder
and warmer, making it harder to detect submarines]{.underline}**
(Perkins, 2016). **[Maritime background noise]{.underline}** has more or
less **[doubled every decade]{.underline}**, and **[radio-frequency
interference has also risen markedly]{.underline}** (Perkins, 2016). On
the other hand, **[submarines are getting quieter and increasingly hard
to detect]{.underline}** a**[s they employ better hull designs,
air-independent propulsion, noise-cancelling, and acoustic jamming
system]{.underline}**s (Clark, 2015b). As a consequence of this twin
movement, it is entirely possible that 'sound parity' might soon occur
-- i.e. submarines could become quieter than the sea's ambient noise
(Perkins, 2016).

A. SENSOR TECHNOLOGIES

59\. **[Progress in traditional sonar detection
technologies]{.underline}** **[continues to be slow and evolutionary
(]{.underline}**O'Hanlon, 2018). As submarines become quieter, the
**[detection ranges for passive sonars --]{.underline}** the **[dominant
ASW sensor for the last five decades]{.underline}** -- **[have fallen
from multiple miles to hundreds of yards]{.underline}** (Perkins, 2016).
Active sonar system ranges are still in the range of single-digit
kilometres, but they face problems in the classification of submarine
signals (Perkins, 2016). All this leads one expert to argue that
**[traditional sensors]{.underline}** "**[are]{.underline}** **[rapidly
approaching a point of obsolescence]{.underline}**" (Perkins, 2016).
However, **[artificial intelligence, big data, and the miniaturisation
of computing power]{.underline}** **[could help]{.underline}**
**[sustain traditional sensor technologies]{.underline}** for some time.
For example, **[artificial intelligence applications are enabling
oceanographic modelling]{.underline}** in (near) real time, **[boosting
ASW sensor capabilities]{.underline}** **[significantly]{.underline}**,
and **[giving the means to sift through the enormous amount of gathered
data to find an actual target]{.underline}** (Clark, 2015a).

60\. Faced with the plateauing of traditional sensor capabilities,
scientists and engineers are working on making new technologies viable.
Non-acoustic detection methods are an increasing area of focus.
Researchers hope to develop technologies that could, for example, detect
the chemical and radiological emissions of submarines, bounce laser
light off submarines to make them visible, or sense the tiny changes in
ocean surface levels, wave patterns, or ocean temperatures when a
submarine passes underneath (Clark, 2015a; Perkins, 2016; Hicks et al.,
2016). Quantum technologies are crucial components for non-acoustic
sensors. Scientists and researchers in Allied member states, but notably
also in China, are investing in this area.

61\. Navies are also developing new detection systems which can be
installed on the seabed or on land, or float in water. The US Navy, for
example, has programmes for a portable sensor to be installed at key
chokepoints in the Shallow Water Surveillance System and the Persistent
Littoral Undersea Surveillance (Clark, 2015a).

B. MARITIME UNMANNED SYSTEMS

62\. **[In addition to new sensors,]{.underline}** a **[new vision for
the future of ASW is taking shape based on]{.underline}** **[maritime
unmanned systems]{.underline}** (see also Figure 2). MARCOM Deputy
Commander Vice Admiral Bléjean told Committee members that he saw
maritime unmanned systems as **[future "game changers]{.underline}**".
**[Allies needed to]{.underline}** **[understand the technology today to
prepare for this future]{.underline}**, especially since non-NATO navies
were investing heavily in them, members heard.

63\. Maritime unmanned systems comprise two classes of autonomous
unmanned vehicles (AUV): unmanned surface vessels as well as unmanned
underwater vessels. Unmanned surface vessels can range from the big Sea
Hunter to small Aqua Quads or Wave Gliders. Unmanned underwater vessels
come in all sizes too -- from buoyancy gliders to the extra-large Boeing
Echo Voyager and Lockheed Martin Orca.

64\. **[AUVs]{.underline}** offer many potential advantages for naval
forces, as they **[can be designed to be: - smaller and thus less
detectable]{.underline}** than manned platforms; - **[much more focused
on the payload,]{.underline}** as no human operators need to be
accommodated; - **[highly modular and scalable;]{.underline}** and - at
sea for long durations of time if power generation and storage
challenges can be overcome (see below).

65\. Moreover, AUVs **[could reduce personnel and unit costs and
compress research]{.underline}** and **[development
cycles]{.underline}**, as certain complex systems would be cut out.
Perhaps most importantly, they could operate in degraded or denied
environments without putting lives at risk.

66\. A naval future based on **[AUVs]{.underline}**, integrated with
traditional platforms, could still be a decade or two away.
Nevertheless, Allies see **[great potential for a number of naval
missions]{.underline}**, **[including ASW]{.underline}**. As a result,
14 **[Allies signed a declaration of intent]{.underline}** in October
2018 to **[cooperate on the introduction of maritime unmanned
systems]{.underline}** (see Figure 4). The **[initiative aims to pool
resources, talent, and ingenuity to create better, more flexible, and
more interoperable AUVs]{.underline}**. The initiative seeks economies
of scale to enable cost saving in what is set to become an area of
increased investment.

67\. The concept of distributed networks is the key to understanding how
many **[Allies see]{.underline}** **[the future of ASW based on
AUVs.]{.underline}** Net**[works of manned and unmanned sensors from the
sea floor to space would combine into a single system of
systems]{.underline}**. Navies would move away from platforms packed to
the brim with ASW sensors. Instead, they would employ smaller platforms
with fewer capabilities. While they would individually perform far fewer
tasks than today's ASW platforms, **[the scale of the overall
system]{.underline}** **[would give it an edge.]{.underline}** The US
Navy, which in 2019 asked for USD 3.7 billion for future AUV programmes,
envisages potentially thousands of such AUVs working together. An
adversary would thus be overwhelmed with a multitude of small targets
instead of a naval group consisting of a few surface vessels. Opponents
would need to place expensive weapons on targets that are much less
costly than the frigates of today. The distributed network would also
have sufficient redundancy built-in, so that an adversary would be
unable to neutralise all systems simultaneously. Swarming technology
could also lead to maritime unmanned systems where AUVs could be placed
in a 'net' which moves with a target once detected. Such a swarm of AUVs
would form a 'roaming net of sonobuoys', replacing today's 'one-time
use' sonobuoys in the long run. Concepts of launching unmanned aerial
vehicles from MPAs or underwater platforms to release sonobuoys are also
being explored. The UK government will soon begin researching and
testing extra-large unmanned underwater vehicles for the purpose of
creating ASW 'barriers'. Greece has also tested unmanned surface vessels
in combination with dipping sonars originally designed for helicopters.
AUVs could, of course, also play a key role in monitoring undersea cable
networks.

68\. Manned systems -- frigates, MPAs, and submarines -- would still
play very important roles in such distributed networks. However, they
could move away from the front line by acting as a host for unmanned
systems or a coordinator of sensors and weapon systems. They could
gather intelligence, conduct surveillance, mine strategic chokepoints,
and engage in electronic warfare in areas of high risk for manned
platforms (Clark, 2015a).

69\. Unsurprisingly, many challenges exist before such a future becomes
possible. Secure communication is a long-standing challenge for the
underwater domain and for the link with surface, air, or space assets.
However, progress is being made in acoustic communications over
operationally relevant distances, albeit at low bandwidth; in
short-range communications based on LED or laser systems approaching, at
short distances, the quality of wired communication; and in networking
floating or towed radio transceivers to communicate with surface vessels
without them risking detection (Clark, 2015a).

70\. Collision avoidance will also likely remain a key challenge (Clark,
2015a). Compared to unmanned aerial systems, AUVs face dense traffic on
the world's seas, especially in strategic areas. However, until
navigation systems become more powerful, navies can concentrate their
maritime unmanned systems efforts on those missions where mistakes do
not matter as much. For example, autonomous mine-counter systems are
currently more advanced than ASW systems, as mine countering is a less
dynamic task.

71\. Power generation and storage on AUVs remains yet another problem
and thus a focus of research, with researchers developing new battery
and fuel-cell technologies. Indeed, a recent RAND study pointed out that
the limitations of power generation and storage are currently the major
obstacles holding back high-end AUVs (Martin et al., 2019).

72\. Many other questions surround the future of maritime unmanned
systems, for example: - How can the intelligence collected be
disseminated in a relevant time frame? - How do systems adapt and filter
out clutter and ambient noise to find objects of interest? - Can systems
readily scale up -- a key precondition to make them as capable as manned
ASW assets? - Can advanced sensors be miniaturised to fit on low-power,
long-endurance AUVs? - How can AUVs be launched, recovered, and
refuelled in an efficient manner to be militarily relevant? - How will
AUVs be able to operate with legacy systems? - What would command and
control, operational concepts, and doctrines look like?

73\. Kevin LePage, Cooperative ASW Program Manager at the NATO Centre
for Maritime Research and Experimentation (CMRE), told Committee members
in Northwood in June 2019 that ASW is very challenging. Moving into a
future with maritime unmanned systems in the loop will be even more
challenging. Still, despite the obstacles, the possibilities AUVs offer
and the challenges the Alliance faces make it imperative to continue
investing into research and development programmes and, simultaneously,
demonstrate the value of these systems to today's operators and build
operators' trust in these systems, which may perhaps be the most
important element in integrating AUVs into ASW.

VII\. CONCLUSIONS

74\. This report has made it clear that the **[Alliance is facing an
increased and concrete submarine threat from Russia]{.underline}**.
**[The Alliance must continue to monitor this threat and react
accordingly.]{.underline}** This threat is not limited to traditional
'hard security' threats. It also presents a clear, imm**[ediate danger
when seen in the light of Russia's asymmetric and hybrid
strateg]{.underline}**y, **[which seeks to increase its power,
influence, and economic strength and to isolate, undermine, and split
the Alliance over time]{.underline}**. Moreover, **[NATO and the Allies
must also pay close attention to submarine developments in China, North
Korea, and beyond.]{.underline}**

75\. **[Allies have let their ASW capabilities atrophy to dangerous
levels.]{.underline}** This report has laid out a path towards: -
**[rebuilding capabilities across the full spectrum]{.underline}** in
the short and medium terms **[through]{.underline}** investments in and
**[modernisation of ASW]{.underline}** assets; and - **[a future of ASW
based on new sensor technologies and the integration of AUVs into ASW
missions.]{.underline}**

76\. **[The Alliance must also increase its focus on threats against
undersea cable networks]{.underline}**. Non-technical ways to increase
the security of these cables are available, for example by increasing
resilience or improving international law. Technical solutions include
monitoring systems at key sites, and maritime unmanned systems could
play an important role in this respect. Also, the frequency of training
and exercising such maritime hybrid threat scenarios, including at the
NATO level, must be increased.

77\. As with other capability shortfall areas, it must be stressed that
it is essential that Allies live up to the Wales Defence Investment
Pledge and move towards spending a minimum of 2% of GDP on defence and
more than 20% of defence budgets on major equipment, including related
research and development. If NATO wants to remain in a position where it
can fulfil its core tasks, Allies must increase investment in ASW
capabilities at the national level and, when appropriate, at the
multinational level. They must continue to maintain robust fleets of
tactical submarines, MPAs, ASW-capable surface vessels, maritime ASW
helicopters, and acoustic detection systems.

78\. As this Committee has made abundantly clear over the last few
years, **[NATO's science and technology (S&T) edge is
eroding]{.underline}**. This trend appears to be particularly stark in
ASW. Thus, ASW should be a test of the Alliance's willingness to heed
the Committee's recommendations put forward in NATO PA Resolution 453,
which was adopted in November 2018. Indeed, ASW is an area where NATO
can make great strides jointly, in particular by leveraging its 2018
NATO S&T Strategy.

79\. The NATO Multinational Maritime Multi Mission Aircraft Capabilities
Cooperation and the Maritime Unmanned Systems initiative are positive
steps in the right direction. It is also encouraging that the NATO
Industrial Advisory Group (NIAG) is conducting a study on the Utility of
Unmanned Vehicles in NATO ASW.

80\. Most importantly perhaps, **[NATO already has a world-class S&T
institution]{.underline}** at its **[disposal to further an ASW future
based on maritime unmanned systems]{.underline}**: the Centre for
Maritime Research and Experimentation in La Spezia, Italy. The CMRE is
leading the way for advances in AUV applications and operations, **[in
particular demonstrating the potential of AUVs and remote operation and
management of a fleet]{.underline}** of undersea gliders and promoting
the use of underwater digital communications **[using a NATO-developed
standar]{.underline}**d. Allies should make good use of the Centre and,
vitally important, improve the funding mechanisms for the CMRE to make
it fit for the future. With the current and future submarine threat, the
Centre is needed more than ever. In turn, the CMRE should continue to
help NATO improve agility and demonstrate the value of S&T to the
military community. This includes continued engagement in NATO exercises
to showcase what today's S&T can offer Allied naval forces. The
Committee will pay close attention to the adaptation of the CMRE. The
Rapporteur is pleased that the CMRE Director will lay out her vision at
the 2019 Annual Session.

81\. **[NATO can no longer be in a situation where its ASW capabilities
could potentially be overwhelmed.]{.underline}** Too much is at stake.
The Rapporteur therefore calls on all Committee members to **[ensure
national ASW capabilities meet the task at hand]{.underline}** and
invites them to **[explore multinational efforts to further strengthen
synergies between Allies.]{.underline}** Through the Committee's
available instruments, the Committee remains committed to closely
following progress on rebuilding the Alliance's ASW capabilities and
preparing for the future.

adoption by several countries of the F-35. On that platform, **[mission
data files need to \"be updated]{.underline}** before each sortie to
ensure optimum combat effectiveness and aircraft survivability,\"
**[with each nation preparing its own files, due to their inherent
sensitive intelligence data]{.underline}**.22°

In discussing **[the variation of acoustic processors on the variety of
ASW]{.underline}** airborne and naval **[platforms]{.underline}**,
Perkins points out that \"**[target classification capability by each
detection sensor also remains within national channels]{.underline}**.\"
221 **[For this to change]{.underline}**, **[common systems, and data,
for mission planning]{.underline}**, **[including oceanographic
prediction, would need to be established.]{.underline}**

Additionally, in discussing fifth-generation fighters, Layton points out
that **[in a conflict]{.underline}**, **[platforms will]{.underline}**
try to **[change their]{.underline}** emission **[signatures \"to gain
some tactical advantage.]{.underline}**\"222 This could be extrapolated
to the case of ASW, where submarines would certainly attempt to change
their operating parameters to avoid being detected and classified.
Layton argues that in this case, **[until the adversary\'s signature is
determined]{.underline}**, the **[algorithms will be searching
for]{.underline}** the **[wrong parameters and that \"incorrect
information entered into the network\"]{.underline}** by users or
algorithms will be disseminated to all other users on the network,
potentially creating an \"inaccurate common picture.\"223 Furthermore,
as nations update their data files and algorithms, the odds that
**[shared detection and tracking algorithms]{.underline}** will begin to
**[deviate between nations]{.underline}** as software blocks are updated
increases, potentially **[negatively impacting
interoperability]{.underline}**.224

**[NATO\'s M3A SOR tackles this challenge somewhat]{.underline}** by
establishing the importance of establishing appropriate STANAGs to
enable interoperability to \"support exchange and collaborative use of
surveillance data and information,\" **[but it remains to be seen
exactly what information will be shared and what will be guarded at the

have their own restrictions on what **[acoustic intelligence (ACINT) can
be shared with which nations]{.underline}**, **[but in order to adopt

nations will have to demonstrate prowess in the undersea domain to
achieve their collective security goals and deter Russia]{.underline}**.
**[Simply developing and maintaining disparate capabilities will not be
sufficient]{.underline}**. Instead, **[capabilities will have to be
regularly exercised]{.underline}** and employed **[in a combined
fashion]{.underline}** **[as an unequivocal signal of
intent]{.underline}**, **[resolve]{.underline}**, **[and
commitment]{.underline}**. When looking at training and NATO exercises
in particular, there are some that are **[specifically focused on
rebuilding ASW competencies or incorporating ASW
elements]{.underline}**. In 2015, NATO conducted a major ASW exercise
named Dynamic Mongoose that included contributions of submarines and
surface vessels from many NATO nations as well as Swedish submarines.
This **[exercise allow]{.underline}**ed **[the Commander of Submarine
Forces NATO to gain experience]{.underline}** **[in integrated ASW
activities]{.underline}**. Exercises of this scale and scope need to be
conducted on a regular basis **[with the focus of restoring deep water
ASW capabilities and providing training for SSN-operating nations in
littoral combat]{.underline}**. BALTOPS is a U.S.-sponsored annual
exercise in the Baltic Sea that focuses on a wide range of maritime
missions to include ASW. This exercise is generally viewed as a forum to
drive systems and operational interoperability between a wide range of
NATO and partner nations in this vital region. Due to the changing
threat environment, recent BALTOPS have more heavily focused on
developing ASW and amphibious warfare competencies. **[This exercise and
the U.S. role therein will be vital for creating a theater ASW
capability for the Baltic Sea]{.underline}**. Desired Effect:
**[Increased readiness, interoperability, and deterrent
value]{.underline}**. Creates venues for building and maintaining staff
and command expertise. UPGRADING CAPABILITIES **[NATO investment in ASW
capabilities has fallen across the board]{.underline}** as the
capability seemed less compelling post--Cold War. Accordingly, **[past
excellence in ASW platforms]{.underline}**, payloads, and personnel
**[has atrophied in NATO]{.underline}** and partner navies. **[NATO
nations must recapitalize their ASW capabilities to achieve the needed
proficiency with integrated theater ASW]{.underline}**. These
investments will have to be made in coordination with NATO's Nordic
partners and ideally take a broader federated approach that seeks to
maximize cost-savings, effectiveness, and efficiency across
participating nations. Groups of nations with similar requirements would
map out clear procurement priorities and divisions of labor; establish a
unified maintenance and training pipeline for specialized skills; engage
in joint research and development; develop common standards; and
emphasize interoperability. This method would seek to leverage common
platforms or mission systems to achieve greater information sharing and
enhanced ASW sensor coverage of key areas. A new ASW COE, as
recommended, could ostensibly be a driver and facilitator for a
federated approach. The CSIS study team acknowledges, however, that a
federated approach to shipbuilding, in particular, is likely not
feasible for many nations. Nations are highly protective of their
national shipbuilding industries, viewing them as key national security
and economic assets. The track record of past multinational shipbuilding
efforts is relatively poor, though there are some exceptions.
Regardless, other areas of ASW procurement and maintenance, especially
MPAs and sensors, are ideal for a federated approach.

//BY

A **[Within the maritime domain, one of the most challenging types of
warfare is]{.underline}** anti-submarine warfare
(**[ASW]{.underline}**). **[The underwater environment]{.underline}**
has its own challenges, but **[also offers]{.underline}** its own
**[opportunities]{.underline}**. We see opportunities **[in the
development of unmanned systems]{.underline}** for ASW, **[for mine
countermeasures]{.underline}** (MCM) activities **[and]{.underline}**
for maritime ISR (**[intelligence, surveillance and
reconnaissance]{.underline}**) in general. Not only will **[these
systems collect data]{.underline}**, they will require data,
**[and]{.underline}** they will **[process and communicate
data.]{.underline}**

**[With this,]{.underline}** **[comes the requirement for machine
learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) features]{.underline}**
in what will become semi-autonomous or fully autonomous systems.
**[Autonomous systems will offer the opportunity to develop and deploy
intelligent networks achieving high performance for]{.underline}** a
wide range of applications in the maritime domain, including
**[ASW]{.underline}**. At the same time, we should be aware that such
systems will also have operational and technological constraints.

Q How is ACT supporting the use of AI in ASW?

A Effective autonomy-enabled ASW will require intelligent platforms with
state-of-the-art sensors and algorithms that allow optimized detection
and tracking capabilities, with reduced human intervention. To this end,
ACT is investing in developing advanced assets and algorithms, including
AI-based solutions, and testing them at sea. **[Future capabilities will
increasingly use cognitive sonar systems, data fusion, deep
convolutional neural networks to self-learn and improve
performance]{.underline}** as surrounding parameters (such as the
environmental ones) evolve. Challenges and opportunities in this field
are among the drivers for NATO Allied Command Transformation's (ACT's)
Warfare Development Agenda.

Q How important is data to future ASW capabilities?

A I believe, **[across NATO]{.underline}**, we value the strategic
importance of data and we understand that **[data]{.underline}** science
**[is a key enabler to improve our warfighting
capability]{.underline}**. However, data and data science transcend AI.
**[It starts with data itself]{.underline}**. What is the problem to be
solved? What data is needed to better understand the problem? How do we
obtain it, and **[how do we share it]{.underline}**? **[We need to
answer these question]{.underline}**s before we can start with concepts
such as machine learning, AI and even algorithmic warfare. It is not
just about technology; **[people, culture, including organizational
behaviour, infrastructure and processes, are equally
important.]{.underline}** And, of course, **[we ne]{.underline}**ed the
right **[policies to make this work.]{.underline}**

There is no need to explain the importance, and even the growing
importance, of the maritime domain. **[NATO's supremacy in the maritime
domain is a key and enduring strategic objective]{.underline}**.
Accomplishing this has become more challenging as, on the one hand,
**[our competitors have improved their capabilities]{.underline}**,
while on the other hand **[we have not kept pace with our
investments]{.underline}** in the maritime domain. Hence, **[we need to
strengthen this investment]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}**, where
possible, **[leverage data, including AI,]{.underline}** to enable us
**[to]{.underline}** -- among other things -- outthink, overmatch and
**[outfight our adversaries]{.underline}**. It will be no surprise that
we need a strong Science and Technology (S&T) foundation to achieve
this.

Q How can **[AI algorithms]{.underline}** help with ASW?

A The operational advantages of employing systems with increased levels
of autonomy is that these systems will **[allow us to act more
effectively and efficiently]{.underline}** through machine-to-machine
and human-tomachine coordination. The AI within systems and platforms
with autonomous functions allows an **[increase of real-time
data]{.underline}** that can be acquired and **[that is
processed]{.underline}** unsupervised at the sensor edge. If we then
communicate the result in a secure operational network, the operators --
who will be assisted by data fusion features, visualization technologies
and automated analysis support -- will be faster and smarter than ever
before. It **[will lead to a faster decision cycle,]{.underline}**
delivering effects more rapidly and effectively. The technology will
enable all of this. At the same time, it is important that we understand
what AI does and can provide in our decision-making. At all times, we
must maintain knowledge at all relevant (operational) levels of what
tasks are performed by systems, so we build the trust that is required
to rely on such systems.

Q To what types of ASW activities are AI or autonomous algorithms being
applied?

A Traditionally, ASW has been performed by surface and undersea manned
vessels equipped with advanced sensor systems. Autonomous intelligent
systems **[offer the opportunity to develop and deploy an intelligent
network that achieves a high-performance capability]{.underline}**
**[for a wide range of applications in the maritime
domain]{.underline}** (airborne, shipborne submarine and sonobuoys),
while having less manned systems in harm's way. Those technologies
**[introduce new possibilities]{.underline}**, but also new challenges,
in particular **[for navigation, signal processing, data fusion,
underwater communications and networking.]{.underline}** These
challenges are what ACT and the Centre for Maritime Research and
Experimentation (CMRE) are tackling.

Q How important is teamwork in this realm?

A **[We require teamwork]{.underline}**. That is why it is important
that ACT, through its maritime programme of work and its relationship
with CMRE, closely cooperates with the multinational NATO ASW Barrier
SDI 1.1271 activity and other maritime unmanned system (MUS)
initiatives. Equally **[important is to ensure]{.underline}** **[that we
develop capabilities together with the operational community and test
new capabilities and concepts togethe]{.underline}**r. That is why it is

### 2AC \-\-- NATO Key \-\-- Intel Network

#### A NATO intelligence network is key to leveraging AI in ASW

A **[Within the maritime domain, one of the most challenging types of
warfare is]{.underline}** anti-submarine warfare
(**[ASW]{.underline}**). **[The underwater environment]{.underline}**
has its own challenges, but **[also offers]{.underline}** its own
**[opportunities]{.underline}**. We see opportunities **[in the
development of unmanned systems]{.underline}** for ASW, **[for mine
countermeasures]{.underline}** (MCM) activities **[and]{.underline}**
for maritime ISR (**[intelligence, surveillance and
reconnaissance]{.underline}**) in general. Not only will **[these
systems collect data]{.underline}**, they will require data,
**[and]{.underline}** they will **[process and communicate
data.]{.underline}**

**[With this,]{.underline}** **[comes the requirement for machine
learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) features]{.underline}**
in what will become semi-autonomous or fully autonomous systems.
**[Autonomous systems will offer the opportunity to develop and deploy
intelligent networks achieving high performance for]{.underline}** a
wide range of applications in the maritime domain, including
**[ASW]{.underline}**. At the same time, we should be aware that such
systems will also have operational and technological constraints.

Q How is ACT supporting the use of AI in ASW?

A Effective autonomy-enabled ASW will require intelligent platforms with
state-of-the-art sensors and algorithms that allow optimized detection
and tracking capabilities, with reduced human intervention. To this end,
ACT is investing in developing advanced assets and algorithms, including
AI-based solutions, and testing them at sea. **[Future capabilities will
increasingly use cognitive sonar systems, data fusion, deep
convolutional neural networks to self-learn and improve
performance]{.underline}** as surrounding parameters (such as the
environmental ones) evolve. Challenges and opportunities in this field
are among the drivers for NATO Allied Command Transformation's (ACT's)
Warfare Development Agenda.

Q How important is data to future ASW capabilities?

A I believe, **[across NATO]{.underline}**, we value the strategic
importance of data and we understand that **[data]{.underline}** science
**[is a key enabler to improve our warfighting
capability]{.underline}**. However, data and data science transcend AI.
**[It starts with data itself]{.underline}**. What is the problem to be
solved? What data is needed to better understand the problem? How do we
obtain it, and **[how do we share it]{.underline}**? **[We need to
answer these question]{.underline}**s before we can start with concepts
such as machine learning, AI and even algorithmic warfare. It is not
just about technology; **[people, culture, including organizational
behaviour, infrastructure and processes, are equally
important.]{.underline}** And, of course, **[we ne]{.underline}**ed the
right **[policies to make this work.]{.underline}**

There is no need to explain the importance, and even the growing
importance, of the maritime domain. **[NATO's supremacy in the maritime
domain is a key and enduring strategic objective]{.underline}**.
Accomplishing this has become more challenging as, on the one hand,
**[our competitors have improved their capabilities]{.underline}**,
while on the other hand **[we have not kept pace with our
investments]{.underline}** in the maritime domain. Hence, **[we need to
strengthen this investment]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}**, where
possible, **[leverage data, including AI,]{.underline}** to enable us
**[to]{.underline}** -- among other things -- outthink, overmatch and
**[outfight our adversaries]{.underline}**. It will be no surprise that
we need a strong Science and Technology (S&T) foundation to achieve
this.

Q How can **[AI algorithms]{.underline}** help with ASW?

A The operational advantages of employing systems with increased levels
of autonomy is that these systems will **[allow us to act more
effectively and efficiently]{.underline}** through machine-to-machine
and human-tomachine coordination. The AI within systems and platforms
with autonomous functions allows an **[increase of real-time
data]{.underline}** that can be acquired and **[that is
processed]{.underline}** unsupervised at the sensor edge. If we then
communicate the result in a secure operational network, the operators --
who will be assisted by data fusion features, visualization technologies
and automated analysis support -- will be faster and smarter than ever
before. It **[will lead to a faster decision cycle,]{.underline}**
delivering effects more rapidly and effectively. The technology will
enable all of this. At the same time, it is important that we understand
what AI does and can provide in our decision-making. At all times, we
must maintain knowledge at all relevant (operational) levels of what
tasks are performed by systems, so we build the trust that is required
to rely on such systems.

Q To what types of ASW activities are AI or autonomous algorithms being
applied?

A Traditionally, ASW has been performed by surface and undersea manned
vessels equipped with advanced sensor systems. Autonomous intelligent
systems **[offer the opportunity to develop and deploy an intelligent
network that achieves a high-performance capability]{.underline}**
**[for a wide range of applications in the maritime
domain]{.underline}** (airborne, shipborne submarine and sonobuoys),
while having less manned systems in harm's way. Those technologies
**[introduce new possibilities]{.underline}**, but also new challenges,
in particular **[for navigation, signal processing, data fusion,
underwater communications and networking.]{.underline}** These
challenges are what ACT and the Centre for Maritime Research and
Experimentation (CMRE) are tackling.

Q How important is teamwork in this realm?

A **[We require teamwork]{.underline}**. That is why it is important
that ACT, through its maritime programme of work and its relationship
with CMRE, closely cooperates with the multinational NATO ASW Barrier
SDI 1.1271 activity and other maritime unmanned system (MUS)
initiatives. Equally **[important is to ensure]{.underline}** **[that we
develop capabilities together with the operational community and test
new capabilities and concepts togethe]{.underline}**r. That is why it is
important that all stakeholders are invited to participate in Exercise
Dynamic Messenger 2022 where we will **[test unmanned systems in an
operational scenario]{.underline}**. War-fighters will be the ones that
will use the systems and we, as NATO's warfare development command,
should provide them with the best equipment and processes we can
develop.

### 2AC \-\-- U.S. = Key \-\-- Intel Sharing

#### US is key -- it's the leader of intelligence ops

**Ballast 17** -- Jan Ballast MA is a senior staff member, involved with
foreign intelligence, mission support and national security, working for
the Ministry of Defence of The Netherlands. He has held numerous
analytical and operational positions in both Th e Hague and missions
abroad. (\"Trust (in) NATO The future of intelligence sharing within the

Accessed 7-1-2022, LASA-SC)

To be successful, the ASG-I&S should not try to convince Member States
to start sharing sensitive, classifi ed intelligence. Being himself a
former Deputy of the BND, he will know that **[[Member States]{.mark}
and their national intelligence and security services [are]{.mark} by
nature]{.underline}** **[[reluctant to share]{.mark}
[secrets]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[within]{.underline}**
**[NATO]{.underline}**]{.mark}. Jennifer Sims already predicted the
outcome of such pressure; "If "jointness" \[in intelligence\] is driven
more by political necessity than collection requirements, liaison will
tend to be heavily defensive in posture, implicitly adversarial, and
therefore hollow, despite political and military leaders' contrary
expectations."70 For instance, **[although [France]{.mark} is likely to
[cooperate]{.mark} on intelligence [if strategic interest is
shared]{.mark} and if mutual boots are on the ground]{.underline}**,71
[**[it remains]{.underline}** **[unsympathetic]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[[to integration]{.mark} and cooperation [within any]{.mark}
[multilat]{.mark}eral [environment]{.mark}]{.underline}**. A senior
official of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs explained that France
would always want to preserve its strategic autonomy.72 In sum, the
second priority for the ASG-I&S should be accepting the continuation of
bilateral arrangements between NATO and its Member States.
**[Notwithstanding the prominent position of major European nations, the
ASG-I&S as his third priority should acknowledge a [dominant role for
the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}**.
**[The]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
**[is not only the [Member with the most]{.mark}]{.underline}**
(operational) **[[intelligence]{.mark} to share]{.underline}**, **[but
it will [also]{.mark} be [crucial in]{.mark} facilitating]{.underline}**
(future) **[[tech]{.mark}nological
i[nfrastructure]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[to enable the
exchange]{.mark} process]{.underline}**. **[[If
the]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[[does not bridge the]{.mark}
technological [gap]{.mark}]{.underline}** within the Alliance,
**[[NATO's interconnectivity and interoperability will be at
risk]{.underline}]{.mark}**.73 Air operations and **[Joint Special
[Operations]{.mark}]{.underline}** (JSO) **[especially]{.underline}**
**[[require the]{.mark} [right infrastructure]{.mark} [to]{.mark}
[achieve effective sharing]{.mark} and dissemination
[of]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[actionable and [time-sensitive
intelligence]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[to maintain information
dominance]{.underline}**.74 Meanwhile, the ASG-I&S should invest in and
expand existing enablers such as the underused BICES,75 in close
cooperation with SHAPE/NIFC, embracing best practices from missions like
joint databases and the Afghan Mission Network (AMN).76 In the process,
he should safeguard reciprocity and intervene if information is one-way,
as is the case with CT -- namely to and not from the United States.77
Should Freytag von Loringhoven **[want to address other [constraints
of]{.mark} multilateral intelligence]{.underline}** **[sharing such as
[over-classification]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,
**[disclosure]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}**
**[oversight]{.underline}**]{.mark} as his fourth priority, **[he
[needs]{.mark} to get [the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [on
board to solve]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In 2011, the Inspector General of
the US Department of Defense recommended an update of the US disclosure
policy and procedures concerning sharing of intelligence in a coalition
environment.78 At the same time, the ASG-I&S should insist, regardless
of CIC/NOS, that SC tackles over-classification as per NATO's security
policy and strives for the widest dissemination possible. As Adriana
Seagle observed, "**[Though a necessary security capability in the 21st
century networked world, the shift from "need to know" to "need to
share" has not been smooth]{.underline}**."79 Besides consensus on
internal sharing, the United States and other Member States will also
need to consider the usefulness of increased intelligence cooperation
with the EU. Finally, **[NATO's role in the growing international
intelligence exchange raises the question of democratic accountability
and calls for multinational]{.underline}** (administrative)
**[oversight]{.underline}**.80 It would appear that the ASG-I&S, on
behalf of the Member States, is the best alternative for addressing this
liability within the Alliance

acoustic intelligence as discussed in the historical chapters is likely
still a prominent factor, **[leading to a [tension between

On the **[more]{.underline}** **[active side]{.underline}**
**[of]{.underline}** **[[sub-hunting]{.underline}]{.mark}**, CMRE has
been particularly focused on the **[idea of]{.underline}**
**[[multi-nation]{.mark} multistatic [ASW]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
**[[where an active]{.mark} [sonar source]{.mark} would [create pings
for]{.mark} dozens or [hundreds of]{.mark} passive [sensors]{.mark}
listening for those sound waves]{.underline}** to bounce off of enemy
submarines. **[The]{.underline}** **[[more
sensors]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[that are in the water]{.underline}**,
**[[the better they can detect pings]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[and
recognize what kind of submarine is moving through the water and in what
direction.]{.underline}**

During Dynamic Manta, CMRE operated alongside manned warships to join in
the hunt for submarines, using its "network": NATO research vessel NRV
Alliance, two Ocean Explorer 21-inch diameter autonomous underwater
vehicles named Harpo and Groucho, and a fleet of Liquid Robotics' Wave
Gliders that serve as communication nodes between the ship and the AUVs.
Harpo and Groucho have a towed array to listen for pings, and more
recently CMRE developed a towed array for the Wave Gliders as well to
put more ears in the water.

"**[Having [that]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[extra
set]{.underline}**]{.mark} of sensors **[[makes a huge
difference]{.underline}]{.mark}**" in multistatic ASW, Warner said,
beca**[use when an active sonar source like the variable depth sonar on
Alliance or a warship]{.underline}** like Italian frigate ITS
Carabiniere (F 581) sends out energy, **[they want [as many]{.mark}
passive [sensors]{.mark} in the water [as possible]{.mark} to listen for
pings.]{.underline}**

"**[When you do multistatic]{.underline}**, **[there's so many more
advantages]{.underline}** **[because of the geometry and the extra
chances for reflections]{.underline}**. So we can do it with ourselves,
but **[[if we could]{.mark} do it [with all the
nations]{.mark}]{.underline}** -- **[and that is something that we
strive to do with our interaction with the nations]{.underline}** ... --
[**[then]{.underline}** **[everybody]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[, wherever
they are, [that has a sensor]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[being able to
know the sound source and [sync to it and coordinate on the
reflections]{.mark}]{.underline}** -- it is very power to be able to do
that."

**[The [key]{.mark}]{.underline}** to multi-nation multistatic ASW
[**[is]{.underline}** **[information-sharing]{.underline}**]{.mark}:
**[they'd all have to know where exactly the active sonar source
is]{.underline}**, so **[they could correctly calculate what the pings
they pick up mean]{.underline}**, and then they'd have to share what
they're hearing with all the other nations involved, too, so they could
all adjust their positions as needed to get the best chance at hearing
the target submarine and help track it through the water.

**[Information-sharing [can be a hurdle]{.mark} [with]{.mark} [something
as sensitive as ASW]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,]{.mark} **[with
[nations]{.mark} [often not wanting others to know]{.mark} the exact
nature of their capabilities]{.underline}**, but Warner said **[[the
scale to which NATO could track]{.mark} submarines under the water would
be powerful [if everyone could find a way to come
together]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

Today, Harpo and Groucho talk to each other while looking for subs, and
if one picks up a sound they will coordinate amongst themselves to get
into the best positions for the best geometries to hear sonar pings.
**[[The more]{.mark} [AUVS]{.mark} in the water collaborating, [the
better]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

"We've done it. **[We've already shown that multistatic ASW
works]{.underline}**. That's our system: we've been doing it since 2012
in Dynamic Manta, we've demonstrated it operationally, and we just keep
adding things onto it. **[So it can be done. So, whether other nations
want to do it with us, that's up to them]{.underline}**," Warner said.

Warner said Harpo and Groucho are 21-inch diameter AUVs that were built
by Florida Atlantic University. The vehicles themselves are 18 years
old, but the batteries and sensors are constantly being upgraded,
meaning the vehicle that originally had four hours of battery life can
now operate for 72 hours without intervention.

CMRE's Dan Hutt told USNI News that the next step would be to scale up
these operations. **[[To conduct multistatic ASW]{.mark} in the GIUK
Gap, for example, [would require]{.mark} [hundreds]{.mark} [of AUVs
from]{.mark} participating [NATO nations]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[The
idea, though, would be to "flood the ocean with lots of cheap assets --
they all have sensors, potentially different kinds of sensors, they can
all talk to each other over a vast network]{.underline}** -- **[that's a
[really powerful concept for ASW]{.mark}.]{.underline}** We only have a
handful of these, so we want to scale up and work with the nations to do
a bigger demonstration."

**[While several NATO countries are upgrading their
fleets]{.underline}** of "high-end submarines and frigates," **[many
cannot afford such exquisite systems]{.underline}**, Warner said.

"**[But they certainly can afford a fleet of unmanned vehicles with
towed arrays.]{.underline}** And if they were all using the same

Recommendation: **[Improve Information Sharing to Develop a Common
Undersea Operating Picture]{.underline}**

**[One of the most potent attributes of Russia\'s undersea
capabilities]{.underline}** **[is]{.underline}** the **[strategic
ambiguity created by the submarine force]{.underline}**. Many of the
**[NATO and partner nations]{.underline}** in Northern Europe **[already
possess relevant ASW capabilities]{.underline}**, **[but they are not
integrated]{.underline}** **[to produce a common undersea operating
picture.]{.underline}** **[Developing allied and partner
information-sharing capabilities will help lift the veil on Russia\'s
undersea activities and decrease its coercive power]{.underline}**. To
achieve greater integration, **[NATO should develop a
transmission-agnostic, encrypted data standard for undersea sensing
data]{.underline}**. **[Data streams from static and mobile sensors
could not only feed local assets but be relayed to a shore-based NATO
fusion center,]{.underline}** potentially colocated with the ASW COE and
aligned with the ASW-focused SNMG**[, to provide analytic
capability]{.underline}**. **[For submarine operations, this capability
should include maintaining synchronized charts of allied and partner
submarine areas of operation.]{.underline}**

Desired Effect: **[Decreases the strategic ambiguity created by Russian
undersea capabilities]{.underline}**. A common undersea operating
picture can also help **[ensure the resiliency of undersea
infrastructure to minimize underwater incidents and deconflict ASW
operations.]{.underline}**

challenges (the **[lack of cross-service digital
infrastructure]{.underline}**, AI vulnerability to cyberattacks**[, the

integrating AI into existing weapon platforms, and hesitancy to trust AI
capabilities), **[the Joint AI Center]{.underline}** is
**[establish]{.underline}**ing an **[AI digital development
platform]{.underline}** known as the Joint Common Foundation. The Joint
Common Foundation is **[intended to]{.underline}** be the department's

GAO-22-104765 Artificial Intelligence architecture.55 The platform is
expected to contain shared elements for its users to develop AI, which
includes the data catalog, various open-source tools, and project
directories and support services. Additionally, a Joint AI Center
official told us that the platform also supports projects that have been
approved for initiation by providing the project team with cloud access
and the additional tools needed to package, secure, and deploy an AI
capability. This official said that final capabilities to be offered in
the Joint Common Foundation are evolving. The official added that, for
fiscal year 2022, the Joint AI Center is focused on making key AI
development tools available while also identifying additional open
source and commercially-provided tools that could be useful in the
future. According to Joint AI Center officials, this capability became
initially operational in March 2021, and as of July 2021, there were 100
unique users and seven projects being developed in the Joint Common
Foundation. Even though the final capabilities to be offered in the
platform are in flux, the Joint Common Foundation is expected to
incorporate classified capabilities by fiscal year 2023. In our related
AI report, we recommended that DOD issue a roadmap or a high-level plan
that captures all requirements and milestones for developing and
onboarding users to the Joint Common Foundation.56 Integrated network

from the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and
Sustainment, this project is intended to ultimately **[enable the

developing an AI needs form that 55The National Institute of Standards
and Technology defines zero trust as an evolving set of cybersecurity
paradigms that move defenses from static, network-based perimeters to

physical or network location (i.e., local area networks versus the
internet) or based on asset ownership (enterprise or personally owned).

prompts DOD components to consider the technical specifications of the
weapon platform the AI will be employed on, among other considerations,
before pursuing an AI capability through Tradewind. As of November 2021,
DOD was in the process of evaluating vendor proposals with the
expectation of a December 2021 award, according to an official from the
Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and
Sustainment. AI test and evaluation. **[To address the lack of
cross-service digital infrastructure, vulnerability to traditional and
new cyberattacks, and hesitancy to trust AI capabilities, the Joint AI
Center has taken several steps to address testing and evaluation of
AI.]{.underline}** For example, the center drafted a **[Test and
Evaluation framework specific to AI in July 2020]{.underline}**. This
framework is intended to provide a sequential process for verifying and
validating an AI capability in line with DOD's ethical principles and
focuses on ensuring security, resilience, and robustness, among other
things. According to a Joint AI Center official, the center recently
began an initiative to translate DOD's ethical principles into testable
requirements, but does not have an estimated time frame for completion.
Additionally, in February 2021, the Joint AI Center released a request
for proposals for test and evaluation services blanket purchase
agreements that are expected to provide department-wide access to test
technology and tools for a variety of AI, automation, and autonomy
applications. Specifically, the agreements are intended to streamline
the procurement process and increase safety and security of AI
capabilities by **[standardizing the testing and evaluation process
while ensuring an independent and unbiased assessment of the quality and
readiness of]{.underline}** AIenabled **[systems]{.underline}** to
increase confidence by end users, according to Joint AI Center
documentation. Eventually, the Joint AI Center anticipates
**[integrating AI-specific test and evaluation processes]{.underline}**
into the Joint Common Foundation and synchronizing testing and
evaluation for AI **[across the department]{.underline}**. Services
include analysis of decisions or recommendation made by the AI
capability, testing services, and identifying new technologies and
development efforts. The AI Test and Evaluation blanket purchase
agreements are **[expected to be awarded and made available to DOD
components in March 2022]{.underline}**, according to Joint AI Center
officials. According to officials from the Joint AI Center and Office of
the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment, DOD is
not planning to mandate use of these tools. Instead, Joint AI Center
officials told us, they are **[striving to develop tools that are simple
and widely available to entice broad use across DOD
components]{.underline}**. Center officials Page 36 GAO-22-104765
Artificial Intelligence noted that they do not want to stifle the
efforts and expertise that may already exist throughout the department,
particularly within the military services. Instead, DOD wants these
tools to complement ongoing efforts and be a valuable resource to DOD
components that may not have the expertise or tools developed
internally. The National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence
shared similar views, reporting that the Joint AI Center cannot develop
and proliferate AI capabilities for every user group or mission area
within DOD. The commission recommended that DOD create an organizational
structure that pairs top-down strategy with bottom-up development.
According to Joint AI Center documentation, the center is developing
internal key performance indicators that will assess how effectively it
is achieving its mission to transform the department through AI and
expects to report quantitative measures on its metrics in the first
quarter of fiscal year 2022. According to various DOD officials, in
addition to the initiatives listed above, other DOD entities, including
the Chief Data Office and Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for
Acquisition and Sustainment---in conjunction with the Joint AI
Center---are working on other AI departmentwide efforts. Specifically,
officials from DOD's Chief Data Office told us they are establishing
data teams to deploy to each of the combatant commands as part of the
Deputy Secretary of Defense's AI Data Accelerator initiative.58 These
data teams will help the combatant commands to catalog, manage, and
automate the collection of data. Building on the work of these data
teams, **[DOD plans to deploy teams of technical experts to help the
combatant commands integrate AI into their workflows]{.underline}**.
According to officials from DOD's Chief Data Office, these data teams
will be deployed to each of the combatant commands by the beginning of
calendar year 2022. Additionally, the Office of the Under Secretary of
Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment is working to adjust the
software acquisition pathway for AI and issue updated guidance to DOD
components as it becomes available, according to officials from that
office.59 These officials also told us that these adjustments include
adding in automated testing and requiring a data strategy for AI
projects.

**[[AI]{.mark} and unmanned systems [aid]{.mark} underwater [stealth
missions.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

While **[[submarines]{.mark} are [vital to undersea warfare,
success]{.mark} in the domain [requires]{.mark} the [integration
of]{.mark} a much broader array of systems and technologies, including
[artificial intelligence]{.mark} and unmanned systems.]{.underline}**

**[Undersea warfare is a lot more than just submarine versus
submarine]{.underline}**. My job is to make sure our undersea forces-and
that includes our ballistic missile submarines, our attack submarines,
our carrier strike group ASW \[anti-submarine warfare\] forces, maritime
patrol aircraft, fixed systems, unmanned and autonomous systems, all of
that-are able to integrate as part of an undersea battle force, explains
Rear Adm. Richard Seif, USN, commander, Undersea Warfighting Development
Center (UWDC), Groton, Connecticut.

**[The UWDC mission is to support undersea superiority]{.underline}**,
in part by integrating a wide array of technologies and developing
doctrine for multidomain undersea warfare. Priorities include
cross-domain tactical development and capability development; wargaming;
in-depth analysis of real-world operations; rapid integration of new
weapons, sensors and new technologies such as artificial intelligence
(AI) and machine learning (ML); and direct support of deployed undersea
forces. Based in Groton, the UWDC also has detachments in Norfolk,
Virginia, and San Diego and includes an Arctic Submarine Lab and a
Tactical Analysis Group.

We have to integrate across domains. When I say across domains, I mean
space and cyber all the way to the seafloor and then integrate all of
that combat power as part of a broader joint force

**[[Communications and]{.mark} a [common operating]{.mark} picture are
[integral to]{.mark} the joint-domain
[operations]{.mark}]{.underline}**, but **[both are a particular
challenge undersea]{.underline}**. When were talking about integrating
with the joint force and integrating across domains, what we\'re really
talking about is the ability to share a common operating picture and
communicate without giving up our stealth, communicate using a variety
of systems. My command, **[[UWDC]{.mark}, is working really hard
[integrating]{.mark} and [developing new tech]{.mark}nology and
experimenting with it and making sure we\'re ready to communicate across
domains with both manned and unmanned platforms]{.underline}**,\" Adm.
Seif notes.

Having served aboard five nuclear fast attack submarines, including as a
commanding officer on the USS Buffalo (SSN 715) and USS Jacksonville
(SSN 699), Adm. Seif does not discount the critical role of submarines.
\"Within the submarine force, as part of the undersea domain, our
nuclear attack submarine force does take up a fair amount of my
priorities. I think of our attack submarines as our country\'s apex
predators ready to appear at the time of our choosing and deliver just
overwhelming combat power,\" he says.

**[[Submarines]{.mark} remain [vital]{.mark} in part [because of]{.mark}
their [stealth and versatility.]{.mark}]{.underline}** \"We expect our
submarine force, as a stealth force and endurance capability, **[to
operate inside an adversary\'s defensive perimeters and [deliver]{.mark}
all kinds of effects-precision strike, [anti-surface]{.mark} weapons,
[anti-sub]{.mark}marine weapons, [seabed warfare, mining]{.mark},
delivery of [SEAL]{.mark} \[sea, air and land\] teams and really every
kind of effect you can think of\" he adds.]{.underline}** \"But what
really makes us most effective is when our undersea forces are able to
integrate with other stealth forces and share targeting, communicate and
ultimately provide access as part of the broader joint force\"

The Navy currently is building Columbia-class submarines to replace
Ohio-class ballistic missile subs. They are considered the Navy\'s
number one acquisition priority and will be the \"largest, most capable
and most advanced submarines\" according to a Navy fact sheet.

The service also is building the Block V Virginia-class submarine, a
nuclear-powered fast attack vessel that incorporates stealth
technologies and intelligence gathering capabilities and will carry more
Tomahawk cruise missiles than its predecessors. \"The ability to put a
variety of weapon systems and payloads into the Block V Virginia class
is just really gamechanging for the undersea enterprise. As new weapon
systems and new long-range weapons and different capabilities come
online, my team\'s job is to make sure the crews are ready to work with
and optimize those,\" he declares.

Adm. Seif also touts the **[growing importance of unmanned or autonomous
systems to the undersea warfare mission]{.underline}**. The Navy\'s
**[Unmanned Undersea Vehicle Master Plan document published in 2000
points out that [unmanned underwater vehicles]{.mark} can
[support]{.mark} a wide range of missions, including tactical
[oceanography, communications, navigation]{.mark}, anti-submarine
warfare \[[ASW]{.mark}\] and [intelligence, surveillance and

In games, we saw that \"**[thinking machines are capable
of]{.underline}** original thought,\" sometimes coming up with **[novel
strategies to solve problems or complete their tasks]{.underline}**.\'
In some approaches, this consists of the system being trained to select
moves and at the end of the game evaluating the contribution of each
intermediate move to winning or losing the game.148 **[With the
predicted transition away from \'blue water\' ASW]{.underline}** and
toward littoral regions, **[the \"global trend towards smaller, but more
lethal flee]{.underline}**ts\" and the significant advancement of
capabilities like ASW helicopter dipping SONARs, tactics for
**[cooperative ASW]{.underline}** **[have not been updated in
doctrine]{.underline}** **[to reflect these new
capabilities]{.underline}**.149 While not directly related to the tasks
of sensor operators, **[having ML systems learn how to \"play the game\"
of ASW]{.underline}** **[could allow for optimization of co-ordinated
ASW between platforms and the development of novel experimental tactics
that humans may never consider.]{.underline}**

According to Perkins, **[the quieting of submarines has resulted in
targets that \"may be so quiet that the background ocean noise is louder
than the source the ASW force is attempting to
detect]{.underline}**.\"I5° **[This could drive changes in tactical
development,]{.underline}** **[with ML systems tuned to identify these
\"holes\" in sounds in the ocean,]{.underline}** **[where they may be
able to exploit the quietness of a submarine by how it causes a drop in
ambient noise along a certain bearing]{.underline}**. **[This
discrepancy could be missed by a human operator whose system may not be
optimized to search for this characteristic, or who is not actively
scrutinizing his sensors for this phenomenon]{.underline}**. **[While a
human operator cannot physically monitor several hydrophones at once,
and must instead cycle between them, an ML system could examine all
sensors simultaneously to look for clues to the presence of a target and
could be trained to advise on optimum positioning of sensors based on
the oceanographic profile to carry out a task like finding
quieter-than-the-ocean targets.]{.underline}** These tactics could
either consist of identifying scenarios and applying pre-determined
tactics, as was done with early computerized versions of chess, or could
be in the form of a simulations carried out on station to assesses
alternate options in real time to determine which tactics to employ
before beginning a live search.

**[An area]{.underline}** where new tactics are under development, and
which will **[no doubt]{.underline}** be **[heavily influenced by
ML]{.underline}** **[is Low Frequency Multi-Static Active (MSA)
search]{.underline}**, which is **[carried out through a network of
transmitters]{.underline}** and receivers which **[interact to achieve
significantly longer detection ranges]{.underline}**, **[as compared to
older traditional passive or high frequency active
sonobuoys]{.underline}**. Since \"receiver buoys are not collated with
the source buoys,\" the submarine \"cannot know which direction to turn
to avoid the pattem.\"151 MSA also **[gives platforms the ability to
cover larger areas, enhancing acoustic search as well as tracking and
attack capabilit]{.underline}**y. While **[ML/AI could manage the timing
and correlating of information across multiple receivers, as well as
optimize the positioning of sensors based on oceanography and sound
return characteristics of the submarine]{.underline}** (aspect), much of
the Canadian research into tactical development of MSA seems to involve
experimentation using mathematical models heavily influenced by inputs
from human experts\' experience and intuition.152

As has been well established in other fields of study, there have been
numerous instances of bias being unintentionally input into AI systems
by programmers. Whether seen in voice recognition software being more
likely to accurately recognise male speech, and ultimately threatening
safety if adopted in a car with a female driver, or algorithms landing
innocent people in jail, or influencing their sentences, bias in
training AI systems is a serious concem.I53 As seen in the use of deep
learning in games, sometimes allowing the system to learn without
supervision \"may actually be better since there will not be any teacher
bias.\"I54 Likewise, the development of tactics can benefit the more the
ML system is free to generate its own solutions.

The impacts of fatigue and other physiological factors was discussed in
the Problem Framing chapter. Another aspect of this factor is that the
design of platforms like aircraft, ships and submarines are restricted
by the need for a \"degree of comfort, to lessen the crew\'s fatigue,
and thus enhance their efficiency\" in the conduct of their duties.\"\'
The addition of \"adequate rest arrangements for off-watch
crew-members,\" \"efficient soundproofing,\" and any number of other
amenities such as more comfortable ship accommodations, means that
platforms need to be larger and heavier and may thus be restricted in
their maneuverability.I56 ASW platforms also sometimes determine their
operating parameters, such as altitude for an aircraft or how many
stations are manned on a ship in a certain sea state, based on impacts
on crew ability to carry out their tasks, which generates a kind of
human bias in developing tactics. Without restrictions due to either
crew comfort, design of the platform, or number of people onboard, ML
systems would likely generate tactics unfathomable to human operators.
While AI systems do not have to consider impacts of stress and other
physiological factors when problem solving, human factors must still be
taken into account and the balance between their needs and tactics
generated by an ML system could result in more creativity and wider
operating envelopes.

Another limitation to the use of ML generation of ASW tactics is the
hesitation to trust \`black boxes\' that calculate outputs but give no
indication of how they came to their conclusions.I57 In discussing
medicine, but equally applicable to the subject of this DRP, Topol
describes a \"legitimate worry about adoption of new technologies before
they have been adequately vetted and validated, or proven to be
cost-effective and ideally cost saving.\"159 High-profile incidents of
problems with AI related to safety, including self-driving cars running
red lights, surely have not alleviated these worries.I59

Layton argues that next-generation aircraft \"need electronic order of
battle data that includes the characteristics and electronic signatures
of systems likely to be encountered while on operations\...to allow
aircraft systems to be able to identify friendly, neutral, and adversary
systems when airbome.\"169 This could be achieved by storing large
amounts of data on board with advanced search tools or database look-up
functions. For operators who are now used to carrying smart devices in
their pockets, which can carry out complex tasks using AI (such as
speech recognition), however, it does not seem unreasonable to have a
system that can \"access the cloud from anywhere to exchange data or
request computation that is too large or complex to do locally.\"16I
Using the speech recognition example, a smart phone does not do the
process on the device; instead it \"captures the acoustic data, extracts
the basic features, and sends them to the cloud,\" and the \"actual
recognition is done in the cloud and the result is sent back to the
phone.\"I62

Having data transmitted over a network for a ground-based
**[AI]{.underline}** to conduct the **[analysis]{.underline}** and
sending it back may be **[necessary]{.underline}** given the small size
of some platforms and the physical space that would be required for
computers **[to carry out advanced ASW calculations.]{.underline}**
**[Also beneficial would be redundancy and ability to share data among
platforms in real-time,]{.underline}** which may be **[required for
tasks like multi-static active processing and tactical co-ordination in
shared operating areas]{.underline}**. On the other hand, theatre ASW is
often carried out in remote operating areas and real-time processing
would require significant bandwidth and would be subject to potential
jamming or interception of data transmissions.I63 **[Given the need for
the systems to work in contested environment where data flow may not be
reliable]{.underline}**, a self-contained solution to the real-time
processing may be required. This could be complemented by **[real-time
updates to and from a central database being broadcast as the networks
allow, for example to provide updates on previously unseen operating
regimes for a sub, particularly useful tracking sources, or sounds
indicating serviceability issues which could be exploitable during the
mission]{.underline}**. Whether housed onboard and powered by
significantly more processing power being housed in much smaller spaces,
or **[facilitated by the use of a "combat cloud," platforms will be able
to collect and leverage massive amounts of data, which will ultimately
impact their tactical deployment.]{.underline}**

As with the previous two categories, [subsurface systems include both
manned and unmanned platforms]{.underline}. Also similar is the time
component to these developments, with manned platforms representing the
current capabilities and advanced UUVs representing a future development
goal. With regard to traditional submarines, [NATO and partner nations
should look to cooperate wherever possible on the development and
construction of a new generation of]{.underline} air independent
propulsion (AIP) [submarines]{.underline}. This collaboration should
also include subsystems such as propulsion, sensors, and battle
management equipment. [Joint acquisition efforts would allow nations to
gain savings from economies of scale and shipyard
proficiency.]{.underline} However, differing design requirements that
result from major differences in operating environments are a potential
issue for any collaborative effort. For example, nations that opt for
small submarines operating for short durations in coastal areas will not
be able to support long-duration missions in distant waters. In
addition, all future submarines should use a modular design with regards
to both sensors and combat weapon systems. This will be vital if
submarines are to keep pace with rapidly evolving technologies,
especially UUVs. Future submarines may serve as the mothership for a
wide range of other systems operating above, on, or below the surface at
various ranges. As a first step in acquiring operational proficiency
with these systems, [NATO should develop an unmanned underwater vehicle
capable of being launched from ship or submarine]{.underline}, based on
a commercially available system. This UUV should be compliant with a
NATO 533-millimeter torpedo tube and have a modular payload. A common
[NATO UUV would also have the ability for tele-operated or autonomous
operations]{.underline}. Such a craft [could be used as an additional
ASW sensor to monitor vital undersea infrastructure]{.underline}. As a
longer-term R&D goal[, NATO should consider how future large UUVs will
be integrated into any theater-level ASW system]{.underline}. These [R&D
efforts will have to tackle]{.underline} difficult questions such as
[undersea networking and power generation.]{.underline} The development
and fielding of these systems will permit greater ASW coverage without
large capital investments in manned systems. When teamed with other
platforms, they can be used in concert to offset individual platform
shortcomings. [In the Baltic Sea, unmanned platforms can be key partners
to advanced submarines as they can improve the ability to operate and
sense in shallow, crowded littoral waters]{.underline}. Subsurface
capabilities also include distributed undersea sensors of both the
disposable and permanent varieties. The most pressing need in this area
is the development of a new family of systems to monitor key choke
points in the North Atlantic and Baltic Sea. Oceanographic and
topological conditions can either help or impair the coverage of
distributed sensor networks. Due to the sensitivity surrounding these
systems and the intelligence they produce, the development and fielding
of any such system is likely limited to the United States, United
Kingdom, Norway, and possibly a Nordic partner. Desired Effect: These
investments will replace aging and outdated platforms in the near- to
midterm and lay the foundation for a new generation of systems in the
mid- to long term. **[The effective integration of UUVs will create a
manned-unmanned teaming paradigm in the undersea domain and pave the way
for a dramatic increase in the tracking capability and lethality of the
entire system]{.underline}**. Data Processing and Intelligence Fusion
Sonar has remained the chief tool for tracking submarines since its
inception. While the capability of automated systems has increased
dramatically, they still fall short of a well-trained human sonar
operator. This gap may prove difficult to completely overcome. Despite
this, [NATO]{.underline} and partner nations [should direct investments
that can automate portions of the acoustic intelligence exploitation
process. These technologies can help limit bandwidth requirements for
remote sensors and provide unmanned platforms the intelligence required
to identify and track potential targets and,]{.underline} if necessary[,
cue additional platforms.]{.underline} These investments will be
necessary to leverage many of the systems previously described in this
section. The amount of data that will be generated by increasing the
number of unmanned sys¬tems will be more than can be currently
processed. Onboard preprocessing will be a requirement for [**data
transmission** in bandwidth-limited environments, such as underwater,
and may prove to be required for all systems given the explosive growth
of data and the finite nature of the wireless spectrum.]{.underline}
Desired Effect: These investments will reduce manpower requirements for
undersea monitoring and improve the efficacy of remote, autonomous
sensing platforms.

### 2AC \-\-- AI ASW k Detection

#### Integrating AI in ASW is key to [underwater detection]{.underline} 

**Taylor 20**. Corey Taylor is a Major in the Canadian Armed Forces and

Creative Destruction -- Machine Learning for Acoustic Sensor Operation

In games, we saw that \"**[thinking machines are capable
of]{.underline}** original thought,\" sometimes coming up with **[novel
strategies to solve problems or complete their tasks]{.underline}**.\'
In some approaches, this consists of the system being trained to select
moves and at the end of the game evaluating the contribution of each
intermediate move to winning or losing the game.148 **[With the
predicted transition away from \'blue water\' ASW]{.underline}** and
toward littoral regions, **[the \"global trend towards smaller, but more
lethal flee]{.underline}**ts\" and the significant advancement of
capabilities like ASW helicopter dipping SONARs, tactics for
**[cooperative ASW]{.underline}** **[have not been updated in
doctrine]{.underline}** **[to reflect these new
capabilities]{.underline}**.149 While not directly related to the tasks
of sensor operators, **[having ML systems learn how to \"play the game\"
of ASW]{.underline}** **[could allow for optimization of co-ordinated
ASW between platforms and the development of novel experimental tactics
that humans may never consider.]{.underline}**

According to Perkins, **[the quieting of submarines has resulted in
targets that \"may be so quiet that the background ocean noise is louder
than the source the ASW force is attempting to
detect]{.underline}**.\"I5° **[This could drive changes in tactical
development,]{.underline}** **[with ML systems tuned to identify these
\"holes\" in sounds in the ocean,]{.underline}** **[where they may be
able to exploit the quietness of a submarine by how it causes a drop in
ambient noise along a certain bearing]{.underline}**. **[This
discrepancy could be missed by a human operator whose system may not be
optimized to search for this characteristic, or who is not actively
scrutinizing his sensors for this phenomenon]{.underline}**. **[While a
human operator cannot physically monitor several hydrophones at once,
and must instead cycle between them, an ML system could examine all
sensors simultaneously to look for clues to the presence of a target and
could be trained to advise on optimum positioning of sensors based on
the oceanographic profile to carry out a task like finding
quieter-than-the-ocean targets.]{.underline}** These tactics could
either consist of identifying scenarios and applying pre-determined
tactics, as was done with early computerized versions of chess, or could
be in the form of a simulations carried out on station to assesses
alternate options in real time to determine which tactics to employ
before beginning a live search.

**[An area]{.underline}** where new tactics are under development, and
which will **[no doubt]{.underline}** be **[heavily influenced by
ML]{.underline}** **[is Low Frequency Multi-Static Active (MSA)
search]{.underline}**, which is **[carried out through a network of
transmitters]{.underline}** and receivers which **[interact to achieve
significantly longer detection ranges]{.underline}**, **[as compared to
older traditional passive or high frequency active
sonobuoys]{.underline}**. Since \"receiver buoys are not collated with
the source buoys,\" the submarine \"cannot know which direction to turn
to avoid the pattem.\"151 MSA also **[gives platforms the ability to
cover larger areas, enhancing acoustic search as well as tracking and
attack capabilit]{.underline}**y. While **[ML/AI could manage the timing
and correlating of information across multiple receivers, as well as
optimize the positioning of sensors based on oceanography and sound
return characteristics of the submarine]{.underline}** (aspect), much of
the Canadian research into tactical development of MSA seems to involve
experimentation using mathematical models heavily influenced by inputs
from human experts\' experience and intuition.152

As has been well established in other fields of study, there have been
numerous instances of bias being unintentionally input into AI systems
by programmers. Whether seen in voice recognition software being more
likely to accurately recognise male speech, and ultimately threatening
safety if adopted in a car with a female driver, or algorithms landing
innocent people in jail, or influencing their sentences, bias in
training AI systems is a serious concem.I53 As seen in the use of deep
learning in games, sometimes allowing the system to learn without
supervision \"may actually be better since there will not be any teacher
bias.\"I54 Likewise, the development of tactics can benefit the more the
ML system is free to generate its own solutions.

The impacts of fatigue and other physiological factors was discussed in
the Problem Framing chapter. Another aspect of this factor is that the
design of platforms like aircraft, ships and submarines are restricted
by the need for a \"degree of comfort, to lessen the crew\'s fatigue,
and thus enhance their efficiency\" in the conduct of their duties.\"\'
The addition of \"adequate rest arrangements for off-watch
crew-members,\" \"efficient soundproofing,\" and any number of other
amenities such as more comfortable ship accommodations, means that
platforms need to be larger and heavier and may thus be restricted in
their maneuverability.I56 ASW platforms also sometimes determine their
operating parameters, such as altitude for an aircraft or how many
stations are manned on a ship in a certain sea state, based on impacts
on crew ability to carry out their tasks, which generates a kind of
human bias in developing tactics. Without restrictions due to either
crew comfort, design of the platform, or number of people onboard, ML
systems would likely generate tactics unfathomable to human operators.
While AI systems do not have to consider impacts of stress and other
physiological factors when problem solving, human factors must still be
taken into account and the balance between their needs and tactics
generated by an ML system could result in more creativity and wider
operating envelopes.

Another limitation to the use of ML generation of ASW tactics is the
hesitation to trust \`black boxes\' that calculate outputs but give no
indication of how they came to their conclusions.I57 In discussing
medicine, but equally applicable to the subject of this DRP, Topol
describes a \"legitimate worry about adoption of new technologies before
they have been adequately vetted and validated, or proven to be
cost-effective and ideally cost saving.\"159 High-profile incidents of
problems with AI related to safety, including self-driving cars running
red lights, surely have not alleviated these worries.I59

Layton argues that next-generation aircraft \"need electronic order of
battle data that includes the characteristics and electronic signatures
of systems likely to be encountered while on operations\...to allow
aircraft systems to be able to identify friendly, neutral, and adversary
systems when airbome.\"169 This could be achieved by storing large
amounts of data on board with advanced search tools or database look-up
functions. For operators who are now used to carrying smart devices in
their pockets, which can carry out complex tasks using AI (such as
speech recognition), however, it does not seem unreasonable to have a
system that can \"access the cloud from anywhere to exchange data or
request computation that is too large or complex to do locally.\"16I
Using the speech recognition example, a smart phone does not do the
process on the device; instead it \"captures the acoustic data, extracts
the basic features, and sends them to the cloud,\" and the \"actual
recognition is done in the cloud and the result is sent back to the
phone.\"I62

Having data transmitted over a network for a ground-based
**[AI]{.underline}** to conduct the **[analysis]{.underline}** and
sending it back may be **[necessary]{.underline}** given the small size
of some platforms and the physical space that would be required for
computers **[to carry out advanced ASW calculations.]{.underline}**
**[Also beneficial would be redundancy and ability to share data among
platforms in real-time,]{.underline}** which may be **[required for
tasks like multi-static active processing and tactical co-ordination in
shared operating areas]{.underline}**. On the other hand, theatre ASW is
often carried out in remote operating areas and real-time processing
would require significant bandwidth and would be subject to potential
jamming or interception of data transmissions.I63 **[Given the need for
the systems to work in contested environment where data flow may not be
reliable]{.underline}**, a self-contained solution to the real-time
processing may be required. This could be complemented by **[real-time
updates to and from a central database being broadcast as the networks
allow, for example to provide updates on previously unseen operating
regimes for a sub, particularly useful tracking sources, or sounds
indicating serviceability issues which could be exploitable during the
mission]{.underline}**. Whether housed onboard and powered by
significantly more processing power being housed in much smaller spaces,
or **[facilitated by the use of a "combat cloud," platforms will be able
to collect and leverage massive amounts of data, which will ultimately
impact their tactical deployment.]{.underline}**

### 2AC/1AR \-\-- Bad Data kills AI

#### Bad data makes AI ineffective \-\-- must have effective data for effective ML

**Hao '21**

(Karen, "Error-riddled data sets are warping our sense of how good AI
really is," pg online @
<https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/04/01/1021619/ai-data-errors-warp-machine-learning-progress/>
//um-ef)

**[The 10 most cited AI data sets are riddled with label
errors]{.underline}**, **[according to a new study out of
MIT]{.underline}**, and it's distorting our understanding of the field's
progress. Data backbone: **[Data sets are the backbone of AI
research]{.underline}**, but some are more critical than others.
**[There are a core set of them that researchers use to evaluate
machine-learning models as a way to track how AI capabilities are
advancing over time]{.underline}**. One of the best-known is the
canonical image-recognition data set ImageNet, which kicked off the
modern AI revolution. There's also MNIST, which compiles images of
handwritten numbers between 0 and 9. Other data sets test models trained
to recognize audio, text, and hand drawings. Yes, but: In recent years,
**[studies have found that these data sets can contain serious
flaws]{.underline}**. ImageNet, for example, contains racist and sexist
labels as well as photos of people's faces obtained without consent. The
latest study now looks at another problem: many of the labels are just
flat-out wrong. A mushroom is labeled a spoon, a frog is labeled a cat,
and a high note from Ariana Grande is labeled a whistle. The ImageNet
test set has an estimated label error rate of 5.8%. Meanwhile, the test
set for QuickDraw, a compilation of hand drawings, has an estimated
error rate of 10.1%. How was it measured? Each of the 10 data sets used
for evaluating models has a corresponding data set used for training
them. The researchers, MIT graduate students Curtis G. Northcutt and
Anish Athalye and alum Jonas Mueller, used the training data sets to
develop a machine-learning model and then used it to predict the labels
in the testing data. If the model disagreed with the original label, the
data point was flagged up for manual review. Five human reviewers on
Amazon Mechanical Turk were asked to vote on which label---the model's
or the original---they thought was correct. If the majority of the human
reviewers agreed with the model, the original label was tallied as an
error and then corrected. **[Does this matter? Yes. The researchers
looked at 34 models whose performance had previously been measured
against the ImageNet test set. Then they remeasured each model against
the roughly 1,500 examples where the data labels were found to be
wrong]{.underline}**. **[They found that the models that didn't perform
so well on the original incorrect labels were some of the best
performers after the labels were corrected.]{.underline}** In
particular, the simpler models seemed to fare better on the corrected
data than the more complicated models that are used by tech giants like
Google for image recognition and assumed to be the best in the field. In
other words, we may have an inflated sense of how great these
complicated models are because of flawed testing data. Now what?
**[Northcutt encourages the AI field to create cleaner data sets for
evaluating models and tracking the field's progress. He also recommends
that researchers improve their data hygiene when working with their own
data. Otherwise, he says, "if you have a noisy data set and a bunch of
models you're trying out, and you're going to deploy them in the real
world," you could end up selecting the wrong model.]{.underline}** To
this end, he open-sourced the code he used in his study for correcting
label errors, which he says is already in use at a few major tech
companies.

### 2AC \-\-- Continuous ups/data key

#### And, continuous updates to the dataset to build and expand the model are key 

**Pfau '21**

**[To build a great ML system, the models will have to be
updated]{.underline}**. **[New data]{.underline}** **[will be collected
and added to the training dataset to re-train the model so that it stays
relevant]{.underline}**. In these models, **[only certain model
parameters are updated]{.underline}**, not the design or structure of
the model. These updates, like any other digital file can be measured in
bytes. An important question for system designers to consider is how
these updates will be distributed to fleet units and how often. **[One
established model for this is the Acoustic- Rapid COTS Insertion (ARCI)
program used in the US Navy's Submarine Force]{.underline}**. In the
ARCI program, new hardware and software for sonar and fire control is
built, tested, and deployed on a regular, two-year cycle.7 But **[two
years may be too infrequent for ML systems that are capable of
incorporating new data and models rapidly.]{.underline}** **[The
software industry employs a system of continuous deployment, in which
engineers can push the latest model updates to their cloud-based systems
instantly.]{.underline}** This may work for some fleet units that have
the network bandwidth to support over the air updates or that can return
to base for physical transfer. Recognizing this gap, **[the Navy is
currently seeking a system that can simultaneously refuel and transfer
data]{.underline}**, up to 2 terabytes**[, from a USV]{.underline}**.8
This research proposal highlights the large volume of data will need to
be moved, both on and off unmanned vessels. Other units, particularly
submarines and UUVs, have far less communications bandwidth. If
over-the-air updates to submarines or UUVs are desired, then more
restrictions will be placed on model sizes to accommodate limited
bandwidth. If models cannot be made small enough, updates will have to
be brought to a unit in port and updated from a hard drive or other
physical device. **[Creating a good system for when and how to update
these models will drive other system requirements]{.underline}**.
Engineers will need these requirements, such as size limitations on the
model, ingestible data type, frequency of updates needed by the fleet,
and how new data will be incorporated into model training before they
start designing ML systems.

successfully integrate AI and share data, however, partners will also
need to establish technical standards to ensure data is stored and
formatted in ways that make it easily accessible to and usable by
various alliance members. In designing these agreements, alliance
policymakers might draw insights from existing state-level AI guidelines
and alliance standardization protocols. The U.S. National Institute for
Standards and Technology, for example, released its AI standards in
February 2019. The guidance calls for defining data specifications that
ensure AI technologies meet "critical objectives for functionality,
interoperability, and trustworthiness."117 In the alliance military
context, this might mean ensuring that data associated with geospatial
or signals intelligence are formatted and labeled in a common manner and
stored on shared alliance networks. Or, it could mean establishing
alliance-wide protocols for data security and integrity to minimize the
risks of data poisoning. These specifications could be codified in

**Economist 22** --- The Economist, 01-27-2022, \"Finding submarines is
likely to get easier,\" Economist,

Maritime mysteries are not unknown on the ragged western flank of the
British Isles, buffeted by cruel seas and bitter winds. But the tiny
stranded vessel reported to the coastguard on Tiree, the most westerly
island of the Inner Hebrides, in October 2020 was particularly
mysterious. It bore no markings, broadcast no identifying signal and
carried no running lights.

Once pictures showing its distinctive surfboard shape and solar
panelling were put online, though, it was quickly identified as a
"**[Wave Glider"---an uncrewed surface vessel ([usv]{.mark}) built by
Liquid Robotics, a California company owned by the aerospace giant
Boeing]{.underline}**. First developed to listen to humpback whales,
**[the vessels' ability to [carry sensors]{.mark} slowly [through the
seas]{.mark}]{.underline}** (they have an ingenious way of turning the
rise and fall of waves into forward motion) **[has seen them [put
to]{.mark} all sorts of [uses by]{.mark} researchers and [navies]{.mark}
alike; [over 500]{.mark} have been [sold]{.mark} to date.]{.underline}**

**[Whales are not the only things they listen to. When contacted about
the Wave Glider found in Tiree]{.underline}**, and others that have
washed up on the coasts of Lewis in the Outer Hebrides, Unst in Shetland
and Donegal, **[Liquid Robotics simply said it would let the owners
know]{.underline}**. But **[it is a matter of record that in 2016 Wave
Gliders were [used to detect and track a Royal Navy]{.mark} submarine in
an exercise; and it is past those north-western coasts that Britain's
nuclear armed submarines ([ssbns]{.mark}) make their way from their base
at Faslane, near Glasgow, to the open ocean.]{.underline}**

**[The idea that [submarines]{.mark} loitering in the depths are
undetectable is [fundamental to modern nuclear deterrence]{.mark}.
America, Britain, China, France, India, Israel and Russia act on the
basis that though a [nuclear-armed adversary could]{.mark} conceivably
destroy their land-based forces in a [first strike]{.mark}, it could
[not wipe out]{.mark} their [submarines]{.mark}. A [submarine]{.mark} at
depth [cannot be seen]{.mark} from afar---daylight is all but
undetectable at depths of more than a couple of hundred metres. [Radio
waves fare even worse,]{.mark} making [underwater radar]{.mark} a
[non-starter]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Sound carries, but the boats can be
remarkably silent; **[the [noise]{.mark} made by a modern ssbn is [less
than a millionth of]{.mark} the racket produced by the first such
[boats]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**[That leaves active [sonar]{.mark}]{.underline}**, which rather than
listening for noises made by its quarry emits sounds **[[designed to
bounce]{.mark} off them. This lets an [adversary locate]{.mark} a
[submerged submarine precisely]{.mark} enough to [attack it]{.mark}. But
it is [limited in its range]{.mark}, and by the ways sounds are
distorted and dissipated by changes in [pressure, temperature and
salinity]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

This is all taken to mean that **[[weapons]{.mark} on ssbns can be
[relied on for retali]{.mark}ation if a first strike devastates
everything else. That [guaranteed]{.mark} capability to respond is held
to keep [deterrence]{.mark} stable.]{.underline}**

**[From surfboards to Red October]{.underline}**

America's most recent review of nuclear policy concluded that "**[There
are [no known]{.mark}, near-term credible [threats to]{.mark} the
survivability of the [ssbn]{.mark} force]{.underline}**." But **[what is
near-term, and for that matter credible, is a [matter of
opinion]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In 2020 a panel of experts assembled by
the National Security College of the Australian National University
concluded that, "**[The [oceans ar]{.mark}e, in most circumstances, at
least likely...to become [transparent by]{.mark} the [2050]{.mark}s."
Trends making it [harder to hide]{.mark} above the waves---[more]{.mark}
numerous and more capable [sensors]{.mark} and more powerful ways of
sifting through their output---[are at play underwater]{.mark},
too.]{.underline}**

**[To put a submarine at risk you must first detect it, then track
it]{.underline}**. Since the 1980s **[[America]{.mark} and its allies
have [relied on]{.mark} the [hydrophone]{.mark} arrays of the Fixed
Distributed System ([fds]{.mark}) for such detection. The
[sensors]{.mark},]{.underline}** tethered to the sea floor,
**[[float]{.mark} at a "critical depth" where acoustical geometry
shields them from extraneous noise and makes the faint sounds of a
submarine passing overhead stand out. America now has fds systems in
both the Atlantic and the Pacific, with ships, submarines and aircraft
available to set about tracking anything they detect]{.underline}**.

Owen Cote, a submarine expert at mit, says that **[such [listening
arrays]{.mark} remain, for now, the [only]{.mark} truly [effective
method]{.mark} of detecting a very quiet submarine]{.underline}**. Their
drawback is that, being quite short range, **[[they]{.mark} [cannot
cover whole ocean basins]{.mark}. They [just]{.mark} cover [choke
points]{.mark}, such as the gaps between Greenland and Iceland and
Iceland and Britain, or the entrances to the Philippine
Sea.]{.underline}**

Unmanned Systems **[Current NATO policy on drones has improved in recent
years, but it is still lacking to keep up with swift technological and
military advances]{.underline}**. **[NATO is also working to further
develop unmanned vehicles and systems through its maritime unmanned
systems initiative, adjacent unmanned underwater vehicle efforts, and
the NATO Allied Ground Surveillance System]{.underline}**. **[Unmanned
systems will continue to increase in importance, as more countries
pursue such efforts]{.underline}**. **[Turkey recently tested an
unmanned anti-submarine warfare vessel]{.underline}**, highlighting the
push towards unmanned systems across domains. **[Estonia has also been
testing an autonomous]{.underline}** counter unmanned aerial
**[system]{.underline}**. **[While these developments from NATO alliance
members can provide helpful expertise and experience for NATO, Russia
has been testing unmanned ground vehicles (UGV) making clear the need to
always be adapting in response to new developments in tech and unmanned
systems]{.underline}**. The recent NATO summit and the NATO 2030 Agenda
highlighted the need to continue to preserve its technological edge.
Artificial Intelligence **[For NATO to preserve its technological edge
in this field, the rapid evolution of technology and especially
autonomous technologies will have an impact on the use of drones and
drone proliferation that needs to be addressed]{.underline}**. Future
drones have the potential to be fully automated, be programmed to
execute auto-auction, as well as enhanced intelligent piloting models.
Yet full and even partial automation through artificial intelligence
poses many risks. AI drones use facial-recognition technology, which can
easily go wrong. Further, AI technology can harbor biases or behave
unpredictably. It is also likely that drones will be adopted much more
for use outside of military and security reasons, as they have the
potential to be used in emergency preparedness and response. While
integrating AI into drone systems does pose many benefits such as
real-time data, improving human operation, and more, it poses much more
problematic risks. **[Yet as countries have already begun to incorporate
AI into their drones, NATO needs to be prepared to incorporate AI into
military preparedness, particularly drones, while also doing so
responsibly and fully aware of the risks.]{.underline}**
Counter-unmanned aerial systems efforts are also important because they
can have the ability to detect and/or intercept drones. This is
essential, because **[while NATO has been pursuing a dedicated C-UAS
effort since 2019\*, which is led by a specific new working group, this
effort still lacks the funding and dedication needed to keep up with the
ever changing and challenging drone market]{.underline}**. **[NATO
should prioritize C-UAS developments, which currently lag far behind UAS
developments]{.underline}**. **[Future C-UAS solutions will also need to
account for further autonomous decision-making approaches, which will
require stronger cooperation at every level of NATO to counter the
threat of drones]{.underline}**. **[Stronger]{.underline}** **[technical
cooperation]{.underline}** **[between NATO member states is especially
important]{.underline}** **[given the risk many of its Eastern European
members are to face the most immediate threats from gray zone or
conventional conflicts]{.underline}**. **[NATO should]{.underline}**
configure a special working group on how AI will affect drone
development and C-UAS systems. It should then **[serve as the leader in
pushing for C-UAS systems for all its members, encouraging technical
cooperation and sharing especially from countries like the U.S. that
have poured money into C-UAS developments]{.underline}**.

Looking to the Future

**[Drones, unmanned systems, and artificial intelligence have all been
at the forefront of discussions on technology and security around the
world]{.underline}**. **[Yet all of these developments require large
levels of funding and strong industrial and defense bases in order to
continue their production and advancements. And keeping up with the
development of adversaries on unmanned submarines, aircrafts and ships
is simply not economically viable]{.underline}**. **[NATO already
struggles with financing issues, with discussions about individual

with no solid conclusion in sight. **[Prioritization will have to be the
key going forward.]{.underline}** **[NATO will need to decide which
technological developments to prioritize]{.underline}** over the others
**[when it comes to funding]{.underline}**, **[and it should also work
to convince alliance members to increase their funding of such important
operations like drones, unmanned systems, and artificial

**[The future of robotic warfare, unmanned systems, and drones will be
characterized by increasing technological advancements across the board,
most presently including the incorporation of developments in
AI]{.underline}**. **[The new NATO AI strategy that has just been
released makes clear that NATO knows that AI has the ability to
significantly escalate and change threats and threat
perception]{.underline}**. Debates over weapons and systems
characterized by increasing autonomy will continue to be at the
forefront of thinking. **[NATO should continue to work across the board
to continue its recent focus on preserving its technological edge
through greater cooperation between allies]{.underline}**, **[and a
stronger look at newer technologies that have the possibility to
significantly affect security and defense]{.underline}**. This will also
require NATO to prioritize the funding of such developments and
investments. A strong funding base is needed to keep up with the

**[Russian]{.underline}** **[attack submarines]{.underline}**, the most
in two decades, **[are]{.underline}** **[prowling]{.underline}**
**[the]{.underline}** coastlines of Scandinavia and Scotland, the
Mediterranean Sea and the **[North Atlantic]{.underline}** **[in what
Western military officials say is a significantly increased
presence]{.underline}** **[aimed at contesting]{.underline}** American
and **[NATO undersea dominance]{.underline}**.

Adm. Mark Ferguson, the United States Navy's top commander in Europe,
said last fall that the **[intensity of Russian submarine patrols had
risen by almost 50 percent over the past year]{.underline}**, citing
public remarks by the Russian Navy chief, Adm. Viktor Chirkov. Analysts
say that tempo has not changed since then.

The **[patrols]{.underline}** are the **[most visible sign of a renewed
interest]{.underline}** **[in submarine warfare]{.underline}**
**[by]{.underline}** President Vladimir V. **[Putin]{.underline}**,
**[whose]{.underline}** **[government]{.underline}** **[has
spent]{.underline}** **[billions]{.underline}** of dollars **[for new
classes of diesel and nuclear-powered attack submarines]{.underline}**
that are quieter, better armed and operated by more proficient crews
than in the past.

The **[tensions are part of an expanding rivalry and military
buildup]{.underline}**, with echoes of the Cold War, between the United
States and Russia. Moscow is projecting force not only in the North
Atlantic but also in Syria and Ukraine and building up its nuclear
arsenal and cyberwarfare capacities in what American military officials
say is an attempt to prove its relevance after years of economic decline
and retrenchment.

Independent American military analysts see the **[increased Russian
submarine patrols as a legitimate challenge]{.underline}**
**[to]{.underline}** the United States and **[NATO]{.underline}**.
**[Even short of tensions, there is the possibility of accidents and
miscalculations]{.underline}**. **[But whatever the threat, the Pentagon
is also using the stepped-up Russian patrols as another argument for
bigger budgets for submarines and anti-submarine warfare.]{.underline}**

American naval officials say that **[in the short term]{.underline}**,
**[the growing number of Russian submarines,]{.underline}** with their
ability to shadow Western vessels and European coastlines, **[will
require]{.underline}** **[more]{.underline}** ships, planes and
**[subs]{.underline}** **[to monitor them]{.underline}**. In the long
term, the Defense Department has proposed \$8.1 billion over the next
five years for "undersea capabilities," including nine new
Virginia-class attack submarines that can carry up to 40 Tomahawk cruise
missiles, more than triple the capacity now.

"**[We're back to the great powers competition]{.underline}**," Adm.
John M. Richardson, the chief of naval operations, said in an interview.

Last week, unarmed Russian warplanes repeatedly buzzed a Navy destroyer
in the Baltic Sea and at one point came within 30 feet of the warship,
American officials said. Last year some of Russia's new diesel
submarines launched four cruise missiles at targets in Syria.

Mr. Putin's military modernization program also includes new
intercontinental ballistic missiles as well as aircraft, tanks and air
defense systems.

To be sure, there is hardly parity between the Russian and American
submarine fleets. **[Russia has about 45 attack
submarines]{.underline}** --- about two dozen are nuclear-powered and 20
are diesel --- **[which are designed to sink other submarines or
ships]{.underline}**, collect intelligence and conduct patrols. But
Western naval analysts say that only about half of those are able to
deploy at any given time. **[Most stay closer to home and maintain an
operational tempo far below a Cold War peak.]{.underline}**

**[The]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
**[has]{.underline}** **[53]{.underline}** **[attack
submarines]{.underline}**, all nuclear-powered, as well as four other
nuclear-powered submarines that carry cruise missiles and Special
Operations forces. **[At any given time, roughly a third of America's
attack submarines are at sea]{.underline}**, **[either on patrols or
training]{.underline}**, **[with the others undergoing
maintenance]{.underline}**. American Navy officials and Western analysts
say that **[American attack submarines]{.underline}**, which are made
for speed, endurance and stealth to deploy far from American shores,
**[remain]{.underline}** **[superior]{.underline}** **[to their Russian
counterparts.]{.underline}**

The **[Pentagon]{.underline}** is also **[developing]{.underline}**
sophisticated **[tech]{.underline}**nology **[to monitor encrypted
communications]{.underline}** **[from Russian submarines]{.underline}**
**[and]{.underline}** **[new kinds of]{.underline}** remotely controlled
or **[autonomous vessels]{.underline}**. Members of the
**[NATO]{.underline}** alliance, including Britain, Germany and Norway,
**[are at the same time buying or considering buying new submarines in
response to the Kremlin's projection of force in the Baltic and
Arctic.]{.underline}**

But Moscow's recently revised national security and maritime strategies
emphasize the need for Russian maritime forces to project power and to
have access to the broader Atlantic Ocean as well as the Arctic.

**[Russian submarines]{.underline}** and spy ships now **[operate near
the vital undersea cables]{.underline}** **[that carry almost all global
Internet communications]{.underline}**, **[raising concerns among some
American military and intelligence officials that the Russians could
attack those lines in times of tension or conflict]{.underline}**.
Russia is also building an undersea unmanned drone capable of carrying a
small, tactical nuclear weapon to use against harbors or coastal areas,
American military and intelligence analysts said.

And, like the United States, Russia operates larger nuclear-powered
submarines that carry long-range nuclear missiles and spend months at a
time hiding in the depths of the ocean. Those submarines, although
lethal, do not patrol like the attack submarines do, and do not pose the
same degree of concern to American Naval officials.

Analysts say that Moscow's continued investment in attack submarines is
in contrast to the quality of many of Russia's land and air forces that
frayed in the post-Cold War era.

"In the Russian naval structure, **[submarines are the crown jewels for
naval combat power]{.underline}**," said Magnus Nordenman, director of
the Atlantic Council's trans-Atlantic security initiative in Washington.
"The **[U.S. and NATO haven't focused on anti-submarine operations
lately]{.underline}**, **[and they've let that skill
deteriorate]{.underline}**."

**[That has allowed for a rapid Russian resurgence]{.underline}**,
Western and American officials say, partly in response to what they say
is Russia's fear of being hemmed in.

"I don't think many people understand the visceral way Russia views NATO
and the European Union as an existential threat," Admiral Ferguson said
in an interview.

In Naples, at the headquarters of the United States Navy's European
operations, including the Sixth Fleet, commanders for the first time in
decades are having to closely monitor Russian submarine movements
through the maritime choke points separating Greenland, Iceland and the
United Kingdom, the G.I.U.K. Gap, which during the Cold War were crucial
to the defense of Europe.

That stretch of ocean, hundreds of miles wide, represented the line that
Soviet naval forces would have had to cross to reach the Atlantic and to
stop United States forces heading across the sea to reinforce America's
European allies in time of conflict.

American anti-submarine aircraft were stationed for decades at the Naval
Air Station Keflavik in Iceland --- in the middle of the gap --- but
they withdrew in 2006, years after the Cold War. The Navy after that
relied on P-3 sub-hunter planes rotating periodically through the base.

Now, the **[Navy is poised to spend about \$20 million to upgrade
hangars and support sites at Keflavik to handle its new,]{.underline}**
more advanced P-8A Poseidon **[maritime patrol aircraft.]{.underline}**
That money is part of the Pentagon's new \$3.4 billion European
Reassurance Initiative, a quadrupling of funds from last year to deploy
heavy weapons, armored vehicles and other equipment to **[NATO
countries]{.underline}** in Central and Eastern Europe, to
**[deter]{.underline}** **[Russian aggression.]{.underline}**

Navy officials express concern that more Russian submarine patrols will
push out beyond the Atlantic into the Mediterranean and the Black Sea.
Russia has one Mediterranean port now, in Tartus, Syria, but Navy
officials here say Moscow wants to establish others, perhaps in Cyprus,
Egypt or even Libya.

"If **[you have a Russian nuclear attack submarine wandering around the
Med, you want to track it]{.underline}**," said Dmitry Gorenburg, a
Russian military specialist at the Center for Naval Analyses in
Washington.

This month, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency christened a
132-foot prototype drone sea craft packed with sensors, the Sea Hunter,
which is made with the intention of hunting autonomously for submarines
and mines for up to three months at a time.

The allies are also holding half a dozen anti-submarine exercises this
year, including a large drill scheduled later this spring called Dynamic
Mongoose in the North Sea. The exercise is to include warships and
submarines from Britain, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway,
Poland and the United States.

"**[We are not quite back in a Cold War]{.underline}**," said James G.
Stavridis, a retired admiral and the former supreme allied commander of
NATO, who is now dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at
Tufts University. "**[But]{.underline}** **[I sure can see one from
where we are standing."]{.underline}**

One hundred and one years ago, a great power released a new weapon on
the world. They allowed it to sidestep its adversaries' military
advantages and deal them a near-~~crippling~~ blow. Those weapons, the
U**[-boats of the German Empire]{.underline}**, **[used new
technologies]{.underline}** to blockade the British Isles and **[sink
millions of tons of Allied shipping]{.underline}**. Eventually, the
Royal Navy prevailed, but the outcome of that battle was never a
foregone conclusion. It **[took the development of an array of new
antisubmarine technologies]{.underline}** and tactics, as well as a
massive mobilization of resources, that **[enabled the Allies to win
this "First Battle of the Atlantic."]{.underline}**

**[Seventy-six years ago, the Second Battle of the Atlantic
began]{.underline}**. Again, **[German U-boats threatened the
Allie]{.underline}**s, this time with new tactics and technologies based
on experiences in the previous war. The Germans had learned how to
overcome the antisubmarine warfare (ASW) advantages of the Allies, and
only by again bringing new technologies, tactics, and resources to bear
did the Allies prevail.

**[During the Cold War,]{.underline}** our **[ASW forces engaged in a
constant cat-and-mouse game]{.underline}** with the Soviet Union's
submarines. Nuclear power, ballistic and cruise missiles, and quieter
systems empowered Soviet submarines in troubling ways. To respond,
**[the United States and its allies were forced to build greater and
more effective ASW forces]{.underline}** and **[continually refine their
own ASW technologies]{.underline}** **[and doctrine to counter the
Soviets. In the shadow of nuclear deterrence, the stakes of this
competition were as high as could be imagined.]{.underline}** This was
the Third Battle of the Atlantic, and, although it was not a shooting
war, it showed once again that **[a responsive, adaptive, and
forward-deployed ASW force is]{.underline}** **[necessary
to]{.underline}** **[deter aggression against our nation and its
allies]{.underline}**.1

In the early 1990s, the end of the Cold War, the collapse of the Soviet
Union, and commentary such as Francis Fukuyama's landmark essay "The End
of History?" led us to believe that our strategic rivalry with Russia
and our need to stay one step ahead of Russian capabilities had faded.
It has not. **[Once again,]{.underline}** **[an effective, skilled, and

us]{.underline}**. **[Russian submarines are prowling the

**[confronting our command of the seas,]{.underline}** **[and preparing
the complex underwater battlespace]{.underline}** **[to give them an
edge in]{.underline}** **[any future conflict]{.underline}**. Vice
Admiral Clive Johnstone, Royal Navy, the head of NATO's maritime forces,
noted recently that his forces **[report]{.underline}** "**[more
activity from Russian submarines]{.underline}** **[than we've seen since
the days of the Cold Wa]{.underline}**r."2 Some analysts believe that
**[even our underwater infrastructure]{.underline}**---such as oil rigs
and telecommunications cables---**[may be under threat by these new and
advanced forces.]{.underline}** Russian focus, investment, and activity
in the undersea domain are now so unmistakable that even the head of the
Russian Navy, Viktor Chirkov, has admitted that **[Russian submarine
patrols]{.underline}** have **[grown 50 percent since
2013]{.underline}**.3

**[Despite]{.underline}** the **[economic crisis]{.underline}** in
Russia, **[rubles continue to flow into the development of Russian
submarine technology]{.underline}** and the growth of that force. The
father of the modern Russian submarine force, the brilliant and highly
decorated design engineer Igor Spassky, admits **[Russian submarine
forces]{.underline}** **[are expanding and advancing]{.underline}**, and
that **[they will be a key part of the]{.underline}** **[country's
arsenal for the foreseeable future]{.underline}**.4

By 2020, the Russian Black Sea Fleet alone will receive the equivalent
of \$2.4 billion of investment.5 And these are not the submarines we
faced during the Cold War. There may be fewer of them, but **[they
are]{.underline}** **[much stealthier,]{.underline}**
**[carry]{.underline}** **[more devastating weaponry]{.underline}**,
**[and go on more frequent and longer deployments than
before.]{.underline}** The **[submarines]{.underline}** of the Russian
Federation are **[one of the most difficult threats the United States
has faced]{.underline}**. This threat is significant, and it is only
growing in complexity and capacity.

Russia's New Approach

Not only have **[Russia's]{.underline}** actions and capabilities
increased in alarming and confrontational ways, its **[national-security
policy is aimed at challenging the United States and]{.underline}** its
**[NATO]{.underline}** allies and partners. For example, the new Russian
national security-strategy **[depicts]{.underline}** the **[United
States and NATO as threats to Russian security and accuses us of
applying "political, economic, military, and information-related
pressure]{.underline}**" on Russia.6 **[Thus, not only is Russia
pursuing advanced military capabilities]{.underline}** (especially in
the underwater domain) that enable it to be a credible threat to us, it
is now boldly saying that it intends to act as one.

An **[enduring objective of Russian fo]{.underline}**reign
**[po]{.underline}**licy today **[is to challenge NATO]{.underline}**
**[and elevate Russia on the European stage once again]{.underline}**.7
Building on the national strategy, the new **[Russian]{.underline}**
**[maritime doctrine]{.underline}** **[reorients its naval forces in a
calculated and determined way.]{.underline}** By confronting NATO at
will, **[Russia confirms its status as a great power]{.underline}** in
the 21st century. The new maritime doctrine tells us that **[Russia will
counter]{.underline}** our **[existing ASW technologies;]{.underline}**
**[challenge]{.underline}** U.S. and **[NATO's maritime presence in the
Atlantic]{.underline}** as well as the **[Baltic, Black, and
Mediterranean seas]{.underline}**; and **[expand Russian permanent
presence]{.underline}** **[in the Arctic and
Mediterranean.8]{.underline}**

Furthermore, **[Russia is]{.underline}** **[rapidly closing the
technological ga]{.underline}**p with the United States. It has
**[created]{.underline}** an **[advanced military
designed]{.underline}** to **[overcome our advantages]{.underline}** and
**[exploit our weaknesses]{.underline}**---this is the epitome of
asymmetric warfare. **[Nowhere is this more evident]{.underline}**
**[than in the]{.underline}** maritime (and especially
**[underwater]{.underline}**) **[domain]{.underline}**. Russia
**[rapidly]{.underline}** is **[building]{.underline}** and deploying
**[more advanced and significantly quieter attack
submarines]{.underline}** and frigates armed **[with the long-range
Kalibr cruise missile]{.underline}** (including six new Kilo-class
diesel-electric attack submarines destined for the Black Sea).9 Not
coincidentally, **[these are the platforms that are the most challenging
for us to deal with because of their inherent stealth]{.underline}**. As
demonstrated last December by Kalibr launches into Syria from the
Eastern Mediterranean, Russian leaders will use such weapons at will,
without the same qualms we have about collateral damage. **[The clear
advantage that we enjoyed in antisubmarine warfare during the Cold War
is waning]{.underline}**.10 **[Russian submarines are]{.underline}**
**[more capable than before]{.underline}**, and so **[we are again in
a]{.underline}** **[technological arms race with
Russia]{.underline}**.11

**[Russia]{.underline}** is **[claiming maritime battlespace across
Europe]{.underline}** and deplo**[ying forces outside Russian
borde]{.underline}**rs. An interlocking system of Russian coastal
missiles, interceptor aircraft, air-defense systems, surface ships, and
**[submarines]{.underline}** now **[threatens all maritime forces in the
Baltic,]{.underline}** as well as our NATO allies in Lithuania, Estonia,
and Latvia---wh**[o no longer control even their own coastlines unless
Russian leaders allow them to do so.]{.underline}** A similar
anti-access/area-denial (**[A2/AD) "fortress]{.underline}**" was
**[constructed in the Black Sea]{.underline}** after Russian forces
invaded Ukraine and seized Crimea. Russian **[forces deployed to
Syria]{.underline}** are **[growing steadily,]{.underline}** and
**[Russia has constructed military]{.underline}** **[bases in the
Arctic,]{.underline}** **[militarizing and claiming large swaths of
it]{.underline}**, in contravention of customary international law.12 In
this way, **[Russia has]{.underline}** **[blunted our power-projection
capabilities]{.underline}** through A2/AD and extended its influence far
beyond its borders.

Russia now **[employs an "arc of steel" from the Arctic through the
Baltic and down to the Black Sea]{.underline}**.13 Combined with
extensive and frequent submarine patrols throughout the North Atlantic
and Norwegian Sea, and forward-deployed forces in Syria, **[Russia has
the capability to hold nearly all NATO maritime forces at risk. No
longer is the maritime spac]{.underline}**e
**[uncontested]{.underline}**. For the first time in almost 30 years,
**[Russia is a significant and aggressive maritime power.]{.underline}**

In his extensive academic research on naval innovation, Owen R. Cote,
Jr., of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Strategic Studies
Program has long warned of a potential "**[fourth battle" for control of
the undersea domain.14]{.underline}** It is now clear that a fourth
battle is not looming, but **[is]{.underline}** **[being waged
now]{.underline}**, across and underneath the oceans and seas that
border Europe. This is not a kinetic fight. It is a **[struggle between
Russian forces that probe for weakness]{.underline}**, **[and U.S. and
NATO]{.underline}** **[ASW forces that protect and deter]{.underline}**.
Just like in the Cold War, **[the stakes are high.]{.underline}**

Winning the Fourth Battle Today

**[With]{.underline}** our allies and partners in **[NATO]{.underline}**
and across the globe**[, we present a broad and united]{.underline}**
**[front against any]{.underline}** **[potential Russian
threats]{.underline}**. Our maritime partnerships yield a **[global
network of navies that together form the greatest maritime force for
peace]{.underline}** ever known. NATO exercises demonstrate our unity
superbly. For example, on 7 June 2015, 17 nations, with 49 ships, more
than 60 aircraft, and a vast array of ground forces, demonstrated their
abilities to operate together to defend the Baltic region in BALTOPS.
This exercise, in its 43rd year, made it clear that the United States,
NATO, and partner nations have an unwavering commitment to protect
themselves by acting in concert. Similarly, Sea Breeze 2015 **[sent a
clear signal to Russia that the United States]{.underline}** and its
allies **[will not back down in the Black Sea]{.underline}** region.
**[Eighteen ships from 11 nations (Bulgaria, Germany, Greece, Italy,
Moldova, Romania, Sweden, Turkey, Ukraine, the United
Kingdom]{.underline}**, and the United States) **[demonstrated the will
and ability to operate together]{.underline}** to achieve maritime
security and **[conduct air defense and antisubmarine warfare in the
Black Sea.]{.underline}**

A variety of policy and resource shifts have been enacted that signal
our resolve to Russia. For example, the U.S. Navy's revised Cooperative
Strategy for 21st Century Seapower notes the critical importance of
all-domain access and deterrence. The Chief of Naval Operations' recent
Design for Maintaining Maritime Superiority puts the Navy on a clear
path to adapt to the new global security environment.15 But we must act
now to implement such guidance before Russia provokes again. To do so,
we must engage and conduct operations forward more deliberately, more
strategically, and with more forethought---and in ways that encourage
responsible behavior by Russia while still deterring Russian
belligerence.

From a diplomatic perspective, we can find areas of common interest. One
of the most obvious examples is maintaining safety at sea. Despite the
recent aggressive "buzzing" of the USS Donald Cook (DDG-75) in the
Baltic by a Russian Su-24, the incidents-at-sea (INCSEA) agreements with
Russia remain a heartening example of how we can still cooperate with
Russia despite its leadership's adventurism. We also share a desire to
defeat violent extremist organizations such as ISIS. We must be prepared
to work with Russian leaders if they want to collaborate responsibly on
these or other issues of mutual interest. To do so, we can and should
meet with our Russian counterparts when possible and prudent. Track-two
diplomatic efforts, international symposiums, and other forums that
provide such opportunities should also be encouraged.

Of course, **[diplomacy alone is unlikely to be
sufficient]{.underline}**. **[To encourage]{.underline}** **[responsible
behavior]{.underline}** by Russia **[we must engage from]{.underline}**
**[a position of strength, not weakness]{.underline}**. **[Improving our
current force posture in Europe]{.underline}** will **[demonstrate our
strength]{.underline}** and thereby **[deter Russia from further
adventurism]{.underline}**. The first step in improving our force
posture is to leverage allied navies to enhance our maritime security.
**[We must work directly with our NATO partners]{.underline}** **[to
help them develop the capabilities and capacity to operate seamlessly
together and with the United States]{.underline}**, **[respond to
contingencies, and protect key maritime infrastructur]{.underline}**e.
Through combined exercises and maritime presence, a network of navies in
Europe and across the globe can face Russia from a position of strength
and ensure continued peace. Our part in supporting these efforts has
been clearly outlined by CNO Admiral John Richardson: We must
"**[prioritize]{.underline}** key **[international partnerships
through]{.underline}** **[information sharing, interoperability
initiatives, and combined operations]{.underline}** \[and\] **[explore
new opportunities for combined forward operations."]{.underline}**16 The
old saying "a house divided cannot stand" is more true now than it has
been in many years. **[To preserve peace]{.underline}**, **[we must
unite to deter Russian aggression.]{.underline}**

We also should **[reassess]{.underline}** our own **[global force
deployments and exercises]{.underline}**. **[Additional]{.underline}**
**[submarines, ASW forces]{.underline}**, carrier strike groups, and
other assets should be **[rotated through Europ]{.underline}**e and used
to show Russia that we can bring overwhelming force to bear if need be.
We should increase our ASW exercises with our NATO allies, in both the
Atlantic, Mediterranean, and elsewhere, to demonstrate that NATO can
track Russian submarines at will, no matter where they are.

Finally, **[we must not lose our technological edge.]{.underline}** More
than perhaps any other warfare area, **[ASW requires us to
stay]{.underline}** **[one step ahead of Russian
technologies]{.underline}**. In the world wars, the Allies prevailed
over German U-boats not by force alone, but by innovation. In the Cold
War, the rise of nuclear-powered Soviet submarines required us to
develop new acoustic and other technologies. Today, we are once again in
a technological arms race with Russia. **[We must]{.underline}**
maintain an innovative edge and **[rapidly field new
technologies]{.underline}** **[if we are to prevail]{.underline}**.17

At this time in history we would do well to remind ourselves **[it
is]{.underline}** **[better to prevent wars than to fight
them.]{.underline}** The U.S. Navy, **[through]{.underline}** forward
presence, power projection, and **[technological
advantage]{.underline}**, is the **[epitome of demonstrating resolve and
capability]{.underline}** in the **[service of war
prevention]{.underline}**. In today's world, wars can only be truly
prevented in partnership and cooperation with other nations. T**[he
stronger and more resolute we and our allies and partners are together,
the less likely that war will occur]{.underline}**. And therein lies the
true strength of the U.S. Navy---**[it is not simply by maintaining our
technological edge and our readiness to impose unacceptable costs on
Russia should the need arise]{.underline}**. What makes ours the world's
greatest and most effective navy is the fact **[that we act in concert
with our NATO allies and partners.]{.underline}** It is only in this way
that we, and **[all like-minded allies and partners, maintain peace---by
unmistakably and constantly deterring Russian aggression.]{.underline}**

### Uniq \-\-- Sub Ops Now

#### Submarine operations are expanding now, but NATO is [incapable]{.underline} of responding -- increasing artificial intelligence security under the sea is necessary to prevent [cataclysmic destruction]{.underline}.

In the classic film The Hunt for Red October, Soviet Admiral Ramius
addresses his crew prior to diving and declares, "They (the West) will
tremble again at the sound of our silence". The essence of the quote
could not be more timely with **[NATO]{.underline}** **[kicking
off]{.underline}** **[Exercise]{.underline}** **[DYNAMIC
MONGOOSE]{.underline}**, **[its advanced]{.underline}**
**[[a]{.mark}nti-[s]{.mark}ubmarine [w]{.mark}arfare]{.underline}**
(ASW) and anti-surface exercise in the High North. **[While exercises do
not receive the glory that political summits do]{.underline}**, **[the
need for NATO to test its ASW competency is]{.underline}**
**[[imperative]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[given]{.mark} the current
[great power competition]{.mark}]{.underline}** landscape and
integration of advanced technological weapons systems into current
military doctrine.

**[[ASW]{.mark} is]{.underline}** **[without a doubt]{.underline}**
**[one of the [most]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[difficult]{.mark}
missions]{.underline}** **[[for]{.mark} any]{.underline}** national navy
or **[[NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}** Maritime **[Command]{.underline}**
(MARCOM). The **[[scope]{.mark} of an ASW mission is]{.underline}**
**[[enormous]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[and]{.underline}**
**[unforgiving]{.underline}**. **[Enemy
[submarines]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[are]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[[permanently lurking]{.mark} threats]{.underline}** **[that can
[stealthily travel]{.mark} prolonged [distances]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[and [carry both]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[**[conventional]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}**
**[non-conventional]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[[missiles]{.mark} capable
of hitting targets hundreds of miles away]{.underline}**. Consequently,
**[[ASW]{.underline}]{.mark}** units **[must]{.underline}**
[**[always]{.underline}** **[remain
elite]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[.]{.underline}** The
**[playbook]{.underline}** for hunting a submarine in the 21st century
**[calls for]{.underline}** a **[combination of, sonar, lasers, surface
ships, and aircraft that is known as "Full Spectrum ASW".]{.underline}**

**[Sonars]{.underline}** using sound waves **[try to locate and identify
objects underwater based on their background signals through calculating
a signal-to-noise ratio]{.underline}**. This tactic remains the dominant
detection method within ASW. When looking for a submarine from a
land-based position, **[lasers act like as rangefinders as well as
target designators.]{.underline}** The use of lasers in ASW is growing
in prominence where powerful LEDS hold much potential to increase
detection chances. **[To engage in sub-killing]{.underline}**, a
**[diverse set of surface ships can patrol potential enemy areas, ready
to deliver a lethal torpedo to enemy submarines.]{.underline}** Like
laser detection, torpedoes are also becoming smarter weapons with an
expectation that they will be able to hunt submarines on their own
through a "fire and forget" approach. To round it all off, eyes in the
sky are provided by sub-hunting aeroplanes that can expose adversaries
at great altitude through image intensifiers, infrared sensors, and
sonobuoys which are dropped into the water to generate sonar pulses to
provide a better image of what lies below.

Given the complexity of ASW, the **[active deployment of [robot
submarines]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[is [no longer sci]{.mark}ence
[fi]{.mark}ction either.]{.underline}** Recently, an **[internal
study]{.underline}** from the Office of Secretary of Defense in
Washington **[examined]{.underline}** **[the role]{.underline}**
**[robot submarines]{.underline}** **[could play.]{.underline}**
Specifically, the **[study is looking to [free up larger]{.mark}
[manned]{.mark} [submarines]{.mark} [for]{.mark} more
[complex]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}**
**[sensitive]{.underline}** **[[missions]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[as
well as amplify the Navy's reconnaissance]{.underline}** **[resources
under the sea]{.underline}**. It is worth noting in a time of upcoming
austere defence budgets due to COVID19, these **[[robot]{.mark}
submarines are]{.underline}** **[[significantly
cheaper]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[than traditional attack
submarines]{.underline}**.

With the hazards lining this domain, **[[maintaining]{.mark} operational
readiness and [support for NATO's multinational submarine]{.mark}
[s]{.mark}afety is a [crucial]{.mark} task that cannot be taken
lightly]{.underline}**. According to Dr Sebastian Bruns, Head of the
Center for Maritime Strategy and Security at the Institute for Security
Policy at Kiel University, "**[[ASW]{.mark} has been a]{.underline}**
**[[much-neglected]{.mark} mission]{.underline}** **[in many NATO navies
in the era of counter-piracy and anti-terrorism maritime security
operations]{.underline}**. It is **[timely that the Alliance exercises
this more often than ever]{.underline}**. **[Submarines]{.underline}**
of third-party states are **[perhaps the most threatening challenge to
the Alliance at sea in the time of great-power
competition]{.underline}**. Given that the undersea domain is opaque and
rather poorly understood, and even more complicated to explore and
explain, defence-policy wise, the exercises such as Dynamic Mongoose are
vital to training for alliance and national defence. **[It also serves
as a useful reminder that [NATO is]{.mark} indeed [a maritime]{.mark},
an Atlantic [alliance]{.mark}]{.underline}**."

That is why NATO's MARCOM decision to simulate a multi-threat
environment in the northern Atlantic Ocean with naval forces from
Canada, France, Germany, Iceland, NATO, Norway, the United Kingdom, and
the United States is paramount for the safety of all members. In line
with the modern ASW playbook, this year's exercise will deploy for 5
surface ships, 5 submarines, 5 maritime patrol aircraft that will enable
the Alliance to test its response to threats posed by sub-surface forces
and demonstrate that the Alliance stands ready to defend all Allies. It
builds on NATO's recently held BALTOPS. Furthermore, **[joint
[exercises]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[such as Dynamic
Mongoose]{.underline}**, **[[enhance]{.mark} [NATO's collective
capability]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[to respond]{.mark} swiftly to a
variety of operational contingencies in the European theatre as well as
globally]{.underline}**

Canada's contribution to Dynamic Mongoose has derived in the form of the
HMCS Fredericton a Halifax-class frigate. When not participating in
MARCOM exercises, the Fredericton is deployed within NATO's Standing
NATO Maritime Group One, as part of OPERATION REASSURANCE, in support of
NATO assurance and deterrence measures in Europe. These exercise efforts
continue a proud tradition of Canadian excellency in the ASW domain that
dates back to Cold War. Throughout the Cold War, submarine warfare
constituted a major strategic priority for the Alliance to defend. The
**[most contested battlespace between the Soviets and NATO was the
Greenland-Iceland-United Kingdom (GIUK) Ga]{.underline}**p. Securing
this space for NATO was critical due to the fear of Soviet submarines
targeting American convoys reinforcing Europe in the event the conflict
escalated.

Today, **[the threat has]{.underline}** **[remerged]{.underline}**
**[and is more comprehensive due to new technologies on next-generation
delivery and detection evasion systems]{.underline}**.
**[Sweden's]{.underline}** 2014 **[hunt for a]{.underline}** **[Russian
submarine]{.underline}** off the coast of Stockholm was one of the
**[earliest indications of this resurgent threat]{.underline}**. In
August of **[2019]{.underline}**, **[Russia held its largest naval
exercise in 30 years]{.underline}**. Exercise OCEAN SHIELD consisted of
vessels from the Northern Fleet, Baltic Fleet and the Black Sea Fleet in
the Baltic Sea. More recently and concerning was the failure of the U.S.
Navy to track the Severodvinsk, a Project 885 Yasen class Russian guided
missile submarine that was stalking the American East Coast during the
fall of 2019. When debriefing this failure, it must be noted that the
Severodvinsk can carry up to 40 Kalibr land-attack cruise missiles with
a range of 2,575km (1600) miles that can be repurposed to be
nuclear-tipped. This troubling development led Commander of the U.S.
Navy's 2nd Fleet Vice Admiral Andrew Lewis, to assess that his service
no longer considers the East Coast as an "uncontested" area or automatic
"safe haven" for American ships and submarines.

The **[[dwindling monopoly]{.mark} in this operational
space]{.underline}** by Russia **[against]{.underline}**
**[the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
**[and]{.underline}** **[NATO]{.underline}** **[should [not]{.mark} come
as [a]{.mark} [surprise]{.mark}]{.underline}**. After a brief period of
atrophy during the post-Cold War environment, **[[Russia]{.mark}
has]{.underline}** **[[ramped up investment]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[as
well as research and development in its capabilities]{.underline}**. The
fictional Admiral Ramius would be supremely envious of the quality of
Russia's Borei-A class submarine. Currently, the Russian Navy has three
Project 955 Borei class submarines in active service that represents
some of the most advanced submarines in its fleet. Not only are the
Project 955 submarines deadly silent and better equipped to avoid radar
traps, but they also uniquely able to deliver the new RSM-56 Bulava
nuclear-armed submarine-launched ballistic missile.

Consequently, **[the]{.underline}** **[[danger]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[these submarines pose for the Alliance [cannot be
overestimated]{.mark}]{.underline}**. They **[[offer]{.mark} a wide
geographical coverage dilemma for NATO and can be sent across strategic
locations in the Arctic, Atlantic, and Mediterranean]{.underline}**. In
addition to their **[[first strike]{.mark} capabilities]{.underline}**,
**[they also complement]{.underline}** existing Russian Anti-Access and
Area Denial (**[[A2AD]{.underline}]{.mark}**)
**[capabilities]{.underline}** **[situated in the Baltic]{.underline}**
through Kaliningrad and Crimea in the Black Sea.

**[If Russia's growing technological clout]{.underline}** in the
submarine warfare domain **[was not troublesome]{.underline}**, their
recent "creative" interpretation of the 1936 Montreux Convention
confirms their intention to maximize the threat multiplication effect of
its submarines. Last April, a Kilo-class Russian submarine transitioned
through the Bosporus Strait in direct violation of the Convention
according to the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

Although the Russian Black Sea Fleet has submarines, it has never
received the level of investment compared to the flagship Northern or
Pacific Fleets. **[Despite not possessing any nuclear submarines, the
Black Sea Fleet Recently received upgraded Project 636]{.underline}**.3
Kilo Class submarines like the Rostov-on-Don. These are armed with
Kalibr land-attack cruise missiles akin to the U.S. Navy's Tomahawk
which should be respected from a NATO defence planning standpoint.

**[Should [Russia]{.mark}n begin to disregard the longstanding
principles of the Montreux Convention, they could conceivably [deploy
more powerful]{.mark} nuclear [submarines]{.mark} [to the Black
Sea]{.mark} [with little fear of having them enclosed
there]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} It would allow them to deploy
Black Sea Submarines more frequently to the Mediterranean doubling their
strength in both bodies of water and by extension creating a more
dynamic situation for NATO MARCOM to address.

Finally, **[the need for NATO test its ASW capabilities would be
incomplete without mentioning [China's growing submarine
prowess]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In late-April, **[two]{.underline}**
**[[newly upgraded]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[nuclear-powered]{.mark}
strategic [submarines]{.mark} went into service in China to coincide
with the 71st anniversary of the navy]{.underline}**. The vessels are
revamped versions of the Type 094, or Jin-class, nuclear-powered
ballistic missile submarines (SSBN). Typically, the Type 094 can deploy
16 JL-2 ballistic missiles, which carry a range of about 7,000km (4,350
miles). While Beijing continues to reply on the Type 094 as well as the
Typo 095, they are already hard at work on its successor. The Type 096
will carry 25 JL-3s, which are purported to possess an estimated range
of more than 10,000km (6,200 miles), pushing the United States, Europe,
India and Russia within targeting range. **[China's appetite for the
newest technology also knows no diplomatic alliance, as the recent
arrest of scientist Valery Mitko on charges of selling classified
information regarding Russian submarines to Chinese intelligence is
telling of Beijing's desire to further their expertise.]{.underline}**

As **[awesome components]{.underline}** **[of [tech]{.mark}nology
[continue to be incorporated into]{.mark} the domain of
[submarine]{.mark} [warfare]{.mark} and its growth as front tier
conflict zone grow globally]{.underline}**, **[it is clear the Alliance
will be preoccupied with this threat for some time]{.underline}**. In
addition to calling for silence, Admiral Ramius pronounces, "Comrades,
our own fleet doesn't know our full potential. They will do everything
possible to test us, but they will only test their own embarrassment".
In a time of heightened tensions, the last thing the Alliance wants to
do is fall prey to Admiral Ramius' words. **[Looking to the future,
[NATO Allies]{.mark}, coastal or landlocked, [should pay this theatre
the attention it deserves]{.mark} and remain circumspect of Exercise
Dynamic Mongoose results. Evidence suggests [we have only just started
this dive.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

cables]{.underline}** (Perkins, 2018; McLaughlin, 2017; and Birnbaum,
2017). All of this led Admiral James G. Foggo III, current Commander of
US Naval Forces Europe and NATO Joint Force Command Naples, to argue
that "**[Russian submarines]{.underline}** are prowling the Atlantic**[,
testing our defences,]{.underline}** confronting our command of the
seas, and **[preparing]{.underline}** the **[complex underwater
battlespace]{.underline}** **[to]{.underline}** **[give them an edge in
any future conflict]{.underline}**" (Foggo and Fritz, 2016).

2\. Russia may be the most immediate submarine threat to the Alliance,
but **[there are other submarine fleets which should concern
Allies.]{.underline}** First, **[China's]{.underline}** **[expanding
global forays]{.underline}** -- such as the One Belt, One Road
initiative or its increasing Arctic presence -- **[go hand-in-hand
with]{.underline}** increasing naval defence investments, including
**[submarine modernisation.]{.underline}** Second, as **[North Korea
seeks to]{.underline}** **[create an operational nuclear
deterrent]{.underline}** **[directed against]{.underline}** one
**[NATO]{.underline}** Ally in particular, its navy is seeking to
**[develop submarines armed with sea-launched ballistic
missiles.]{.underline}**

3\. The **[increase in Russian submarine patrols should concern the
political and military leadership of the Alliance. Since World War
I,]{.underline}** **[submarines have been a critical
threat]{.underline}** **[to civilian and naval vessels because of their
stealth, silence, and speed]{.underline}** (Perkins, 2016). A **[single
submarine could]{.underline}** **[shut down a strategic maritime
chokepoint]{.underline}**, **[threatening]{.underline}** **[everything
from merchant vessels to carrier strike group]{.underline}**s.
Submarines can **[thus]{.underline}** **[deny naval power projection and
disrupt critical sea lines of communication]{.underline}**. When
equipped with land-attack cruise missiles, they can also hold critical
points on land at risk. In short, "every submarine is a strategic
asset", as Germany's Submarine Force Commander, Captain Timo Cordes, has
noted (Bliddal, 2019).

4\. **[Unlike other 'hard' military capabilities]{.underline}** like
tanks or even missiles, **[submarines]{.underline}** are also **[very
well suited for asymmetric and hybrid tactics]{.underline}** **[because
they lend themselves to deceit and deniability.]{.underline}** In
particular, **[the threat to undersea communication
cables]{.underline}** **[has risen substantially.]{.underline}** Such
**[cables carry]{.underline}** about **[80% of data between North
America and Europe]{.underline}**, Vice Admiral Hervé Bléjean, Deputy
Commander of Allied Maritime Command (MARCOM), told a NATO PA
Sub-Committee on Technology Trends and Security (STCTTS) delegation in
June 2019. Satellites could only make up for 10% of the total
transatlantic data transfers, he said. **[Special purpose
submarines]{.underline}** **[play a key role in the threat to undersea
cable]{.underline}**s, as **[they can covertly tap or cut these
cables]{.underline}** to **[gain valuable intelligence or disrupt vital
services.]{.underline}**

5\. Another fact should worry NATO even more: **[a severe shortfall
of]{.underline}** anti-submarine warfare (**[ASW]{.underline}**)
**[capabilities]{.underline}** **[across the Alliance]{.underline}**. In
the words of then MARCOM Commander Vice Admiral Sir Clive Johnstone,
**[NATO faces a situation where]{.underline}** "**[we are very short of
high-end submarine warfare hunters]{.underline}**" (Fabey, 2018).
**[Allies have belatedly woken up to this capability
shortfall]{.underline}** and have **[committed to remedying the
situation]{.underline}**. NATO has conducted strategic assessments,
reinforced its maritime posture, initiated reforms of command and
control mechanisms, and intensified its ASW exercise regime.

**[In the]{.underline}** **[immediate]{.underline}**

**[[to]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[build out]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[its]{.underline}** **[[UAV]{.mark} fleet
[capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}**, incorporating and increasing swarm
and 'loyal wingman' abilities that tie together piloted and uncrewed
systems for greater striking range and better situational awareness.
**[Russia's]{.underline}** reconnaissance-fire and
**[reconnaissance-strike contours pose the [greatest challenge to
adversary forces]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[given Russia's continuing
efforts to refine UAV use in practically all major units and
formations]{.underline}**. **[[As]{.underline}]{.mark}** the
**[Russian]{.underline}** long-range **[UCAV]{.underline}**
**[[capabilities]{.mark} will [grow]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[[so will
Russia's ability to deliver strikes]{.mark} against ground and aerial
targets [at greater distances]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
**[[increasing]{.mark} the defence ministry's [combat
reach]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Just as important is the impending
proliferation of Russian combat and ISR drones, giving the Russian
industry access to new markets and new data on their potential use
against US assets and allies.229 The Russian defence ministry will also
continue to experiment with UAV--UGV teaming for more effective
battlefield management. **[In the near term]{.underline}**,
**[the UGV testing space will help define how Russian ground forces
could fight future wars]{.underline}**, and whether such systems can
function effectively with manned formations. This trend is exemplified
by the use of UGVs and UAVs in September 2021 during the Zapad-2021
military exercises, with the Russian military using Uran-9 UGVs for
combat reconnaissance and fire support, Uran-6s for demining operations,
Nerehta UGVs for reconnaissance and fire support, and Platforma-M for
urban combat missions and passing through minefields.230 Specifically,
Uran-9 and Nerehta UGVs were used in the combat formations of combined
arms units. Additionally, the Russian military used Orlan-10 and Forpost
UAVs for ISR and target acquisition missions, while Forpost and Orlan-10
combat versions, together with an Orion UCAV, were used for the first
time in support of ground attacks.231 **[[Russia's ability to
manufacture]{.mark} and test [deep-diving UUV]{.mark}s
[presents]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[one of the [growing challenges
to]{.mark} Western and [NATO forces]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[[as
the]{.mark} defence [ministry]{.mark} [will seek]{.mark} to gain
[better]{.mark} situational [awareness]{.mark} below the
waves]{.underline}**, **[while crafting an [unmanned systems]{.mark}
doctrine that could [challenge Western surface]{.mark} and sub-surface
[assets]{.mark}.]{.underline}** At the same time, the Russian navy is
far from the mass use of such systems, in contrast to the
nearly-ubiquitous aerial drone use. **[If the Russian military succeeds
in designing a multi-domain robotic swarm, it could potentially
[challenge current Western military superiority]{.mark} by forcing NATO
to expend its assets on low-cost Russian robotic systems]{.underline}**.
At the same time, unmanned and autonomous technologies were not used in
a true peer conflict until the Nagorny Karabakh war of 2020. **[Today,
the US, NATO and Russian forces are testing and using their autonomous
technologies against mostly militarily inferior and low-tech
adversaries]{.underline}**. In the future, the **[[Russia]{.mark}n
military [will]{.mark}]{.underline}** continue to
[**[refine]{.underline}** **[its]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[robotics
[tech]{.mark}nologies and will upgrade its proposed plans for
integrating these systems]{.underline}** with manned formations to train
for a conflict against a peer adversary. On 21 May 2021 Russian defence
minister Sergey Shoigu announced that his country had commenced mass
production of military robots with AI that can fight autonomously.232
**[He did not specify which vehicles he was referring to, and the
military expert community debated which of the systems described in this
chapter may have been implied in Shoigu's statement]{.underline}**.233
**[Regardless]{.underline}** **[of which vehicles may eventually fit
Shoigu's definition, this chapter has discussed multiple projects
undertaken by the defence ministry in order to develop technologies that
[could give Russia]{.mark}n forces [a battlefield
advantage]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Should such efforts prove successful,
the **[defence ministry's investments]{.underline}** may
**[result]{.underline}** **[in a force structure that would be better
positioned to engage its adversary]{.underline}** **[via]{.underline}**
a range of **[unmanned and autonomous systems]{.underline}** **[that are
first to the fight]{.underline}**, do not carry a human cost in case of
a failed mission, and can provide a better situational awareness of the
adversary's forces and intentions. These developments are not a foregone
conclusion, given the Russian military industry's ongoing struggles with
key manufacturing components for autonomous systems, such as
microelectronics and engines.234 **[Nonetheless, [Russia's mass
manufacturing]{.mark} of, and experimentation with, different types
of military autonomous systems [signals a]{.mark} readiness to
[change]{.mark} [how it conducts]{.mark} military
[operations]{.mark},]{.underline}** **[with speed, effectiveness,
precision and massed use as the ultimate goals]{.underline}**. To
address these impending changes to military CONOPS, **[the [US
and]{.mark} its [European allies should]{.mark} continue to [experiment
with]{.mark}, and conduct an ongoing analysis of, [robotic
tech]{.mark}nologies [for gaining a]{.mark} key [edge in this]{.mark}
emerging [tech]{.mark}nological [race]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Just as
important in the future will be the ability to develop training against
adversarial capabilities that is part of an objective evaluation
of Russian military robotics CONOPS and TTPs.

### AT: Ukraine Thumps\-\--2AC

#### Ukraine is our uniqueness -- without the plan, any conflict spills over.

**[[While trying to grasp]{.mark} Russia\'s ruthlessness and brutality
in [Ukraine]{.mark}, it is [essential to not lose sight]{.mark} of
regions beyond the present conflict zone. [The
Arctic]{.mark},]{.underline}** where Russia's coastline amounts to over
24,000 kilometres**[, is one such region]{.underline}**. Even though
**[[Moscow's]{.mark} chairing of the [Arctic Council]{.mark} was
effectively [suspended]{.mark} on 3 March, [the North remains]{.mark} a
[key strategic priority for the Kremlin]{.mark}. Aside from developing
the infrastructure aimed at taking the best advantage of expected
economic benefits of the Northern Sea Route and of vast resources made
available as the ice melts, [Russia]{.mark}, for over a decade now, [has
been militarizing the area that]{.mark} Mikhail Gorbachev [once]{.mark}
called [a 'zone of peace']{.mark} and scholars later labelled as
'exceptional' and immune to a conflict.]{.underline}**

**[[Moscow's Arctic policy]{.mark}, envisioning the country's role as a
'leading Arctic power', [explicitly refers to]{.mark} the maintenance of
[military formations in the region]{.mark} as one of the main policy
objectives]{.underline}**. This should **[not be mistaken as just empty
political rhetoric: the Northern Fleet on the [Kola
Peninsula]{.mark}]{.underline}**, which **[[hosts submarines]{.mark}
equipped [with ballistic missiles]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[comprises
[two-thirds of Russia's maritime nuclear strike
capacity]{.mark}]{.underline}** --- only one example of many. **[An
[escalation of the war in Ukraine]{.mark}, particularly in the event of
NATO involvement, [could easily trigger Russia]{.mark}'s further
aggression, [resulting in military]{.mark} repercussions [beyond the
polar circle.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

The **[absence of a dialogue]{.underline}**, or rather
**[[Moscow's]{.mark} seeming [incapacity to engage in]{.mark} a
meaningful one \[[dialogue\], exacerbates the risk]{.mark} for military
spillover.]{.underline}** Numerous scholars, myself included, have
argued for restoring a military-security dialogue between Russia and the
other seven Arctic countries after communication froze following the
occupation of Crimea in 2014. Such an argument was driven by our
**[naivety that a dialogue could mitigate strategic competition,
increase policy transparency and lower the risk of a conflict. We have
been proven wrong. As clearly manifested by Russia's murderous
encroachment of Ukraine and the mockery, displayed by the Kremlin's
officials, of [any attempts to negotiate]{.mark}, rogue states do not
perceive dialogues the way Western democracies do, and talks [will not
lead to]{.mark} agreements ensuring [peace]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**[With Russia in the picture]{.underline}**, let alone in charge as the
largest Arctic state and one that still officially chairs the Arctic
Council, **[the circumpolar North as 'immune to a conflict' has become a
meaningless expression.]{.underline}** **[In the foreseeable future, the
Arctic will no longer carry the idyllic title of a "zone of peace", and,
unless Russia's expansionist policies are hindered]{.underline}** by
Western sanctions and consequent budgetary constraints, **[its
great-power ambitions and merciless politics of intimidation and
callousness will likely have detrimental effects on a highly fragile
region.]{.underline}**

**[NATO]{.underline}**

In many ways, **[[NATO's deficiencies]{.mark} in this area [match
Russia's]{.mark}]{.underline}**. While **[on paper NATO fields a
formidable array of both subsurface and ASW assets, the whole is likely
to be less than the sum of its parts. [NATO's mobilization]{.mark} for a
high-intensity conflict would be in [three phases]{.mark}]{.underline}**
under the aegis of a gradual response plan. The **[first, occurring
within a week, entails the [deployment of the assets]{.mark} committed
to NATO's Very High Readiness Joint Task Force,]{.underline}** including
those of NATO's Standing Maritime Groups.45 **[The second phase of a
Graduated Response Plan ([GRP]{.mark}) entails a month to build up to
the '[four 30s']{.mark} -- 30 combat vessels, 30 battalions, and 30
aircraft squadrons in 30 days]{.underline}**.46 Finally, **[[follow-on
forces]{.underline}]{.mark}** under the aegis of the NATO Response Force
**[would mobilize [over a longer time]{.mark}
period]{.underline}**.47 We assume that **[[unless NATO can]{.mark}
either [prevail]{.mark} or at least contain Russian assets, [follow-on
forces are irrelevant]{.mark}]{.underline}**. And, by extension, **[the
balance of power in the earlier stages of a conflict is the most
vital,]{.underline}** with exercises such as Dynamic Mongoose being used
as the basis for determining the proportion of ASW assets that could be
mobilized within a relatively short time.48 Longer-term exercises, such
as Trident Juncture would suggest a larger force of NATO vessels being
deployed to the High North -- Trident Juncture involved 65 vessels,
including 24 surface combatants. However, **[two factors lead to a limit
the authors\' study of such a force ratio.]{.underline}**
First, **[[Trident Juncture took]{.mark} several [months]{.mark} to
prepare]{.underline}**. And, given that the median duration of a
militarized crisis is 70 days (including the kinetic conflict period),
it is **[likely [irrelevant in]{.mark} an [ASW
battle]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Even **[[assuming offensive
intent]{.mark} on NATO's part, [one would]{.mark} need to [assume
Russian passivity]{.mark} in this build-up, [which is
unlikely]{.mark}]{.underline}**. It is therefore the forces available at
the outset of a conflict that are most important. **[The forces of
NATO's standing maritime groups (SNMGs) and the assets at high
readiness]{.underline}** and very high readiness under the NATO
Readiness Initiative are assessed to be of greatest salience. This paper
treats **[[NATO]{.mark} assets as being at [50% readiness]{.mark} at the
outset of a conflict, reaching 70% within a month.]{.underline}** It
assesses **[[Russian]{.mark} assets as being at [80%]{.mark}
readiness]{.underline}** due to the fact that the **[Northern Fleet is
operating in its own backyard]{.underline}**. These numbers are broadly
reflective of the assumptions underpinning previous studies.49

Data Scarcity **[Another challenge in the field of ML that has salience
for sonar data are the challenges associated with very small, but
important datasets]{.underline}**. For an academic researcher, **[data
scarcity may come about due to the prohibitive cost of experiments or
rarity of events to collect data on, such as astronomical
observations]{.underline}**. For the DoN, these same challenges will
occur in addition to DoN specific challenges. **[Unlike academia or the
private sectors, stringent restrictions on classified data will limit
who can use this data to train and develop models.]{.underline}** **[How
will an ML model be trained to recognize an adversary's newest ship when
there are only a few minutes of acoustic recording?]{.underline}**
**[Since machine learning models require large quantities of data,
traditional training methods will not work or result in less effective
models]{.underline}**. **[Data augmentation, replicating and modifying
original data may be one answer to this problem.]{.underline}** In
computer vision research, **[data is augmented by rotating, flipping, or
changing the color balance of an image.]{.underline}** Since a car is
still a car, even if the image of the car is rotated or inverted, a
model will learn to recognize a car from many angles and in many
environments. **[In acoustics research, data is augmented by adding in
other sounds or changing the time scale or pitch of the original
audio]{.underline}**. From a few initial examples, **[a much larger
dataset to train on can be created]{.underline}**. However, these
methods have not been extensively researched on passive sonar data. It
is still unknown which methods of data augmentation will produce the
best results for sonar models, and which could produce worse models.
Further research into the best methods for data augmentation for
underwater acoustics is required.

this need. Specific investment is required to address several problems

of technical and policy solutions to solve them, and they must be solved

[There has been no shortage of debate lately about the future size and
shape of the U.S. Navy [in an era of great power
competition]{.mark}]{.underline}. Through the fog of competing
priorities, fiscal constraints and a growing list of force architecture
studies, one thing seems certain: [[The future Navy **will include
autonomous ships**]{.mark} in some form. [These vessels]{.mark} (it's
not even clear they'll be called "ships") will not replace the Navy's
highly capable combatants, but they [will extend]{.mark} their
[**fighting horizons**]{.mark} and deepen their magazines [to increase
combat power]{.mark}]{.underline}. There is an urgent need to build
trust before the Navy can safely and effectively integrate this emerging
technology. [While the debate rages in Washington, the Navy's autonomous
workhorse, **Sea Hunter**, is quietly approaching four years and 30,000
miles of underway experimentation and risk reduction]{.underline}. More
than half of those miles have been sailed under autonomous self-control.
[As with any new technology, lessons are learned along the way. Navy
Assistant Secretary James Geurts put it best: [To embrace
innovation]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[we must "learn fast and act
fast,]{.underline}]{.mark}" to "press the boundaries" and "expect
failure" with appropriate judgement and measured risk. Interestingly,
many of the lessons with [[Sea Hunter]{.mark} have involved issues
related to basic components like filters, switches and sensors that were
not originally designed for autonomous operation. Meanwhile, the
underlying [autonomy has proven to be]{.mark} remarkably **[resilient
and mature]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The good news is that these lessons
present solvable challenges. No magic is required. Last year, the Navy
sent Sea Hunter from San Diego, California, to Hawaii and back as part
of a major fleet exercise. There were lessons learned along the way, but
by the return transit, Sea Hunter made the entire 2,000-mile voyage
untouched over nine days. This was a major success, and prompted the
Navy to plan for a similar event in 2020. That exercise, unfortunately,
had to be scaled back due to the impacts of COVID-19. [With \$200
million and four years invested, the Navy is well down a learning curve
that is building the trust necessary to underpin fleet integration of
unmanned surface vessels, or USV. **[This head start is precious and
must not be wasted]{.mark}**]{.underline}. While USVs are not yet ready
for complex roles in close proximity with maneuvering ships, they will
soon be ready to fulfill independent missions. By taking a
"crawl-walk-run" approach, the Navy can realize operational benefits in
the near term while continuing to mature the technology and spiral in
increasingly complex behaviors. [[USV technology **is maturing
rapidly**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Ironically, the main obstacles are not
technological. Despite some in the Navy leaning forward, they're largely
cultural and programmatic. "Optional manning," for example, might
provide a level of comfort for developers, but the real effect is to
increase cost, consume precious space and soften the imperative for
pursuing fully autonomous capability. Consider what the Global Hawk or
Triton UAVs would look like today, and how many would exist, if the
services had insisted they be "optionally manned." Minimal or optional
manning makes sense if weapons are involved, for security and
maintenance, but surveillance and reconnaissance USVs will need to
optimize every inch and every dollar so they can be fielded in
sufficient numbers as the eyes and ears of the fleet. [The late Navy
captain, Wayne Hughes, wrote that [victory at sea]{.mark} often [**goes
to the one who can "fire effectively first."** Unmanned]{.mark} surface
[vessels can help the fleet do]{.mark} just [that]{.mark}. The U.S. Navy
has a precious head start, and [we should press that advantage **by
putting near-term capability to sea**]{.mark}, while steadily maturing
and incorporating more complex behaviors in stride. **[There's no time
to lose]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

- This is so shit

The idea behind **[[XLUUV]{.mark} is to take over missions that larger
submarines]{.underline}**, such as Virginia- and Los Angeles-class
attack submarines, **[perform now but that [shouldn't require]{.mark} a
[\$3]{.mark} [billion]{.mark} hull to perform.]{.underline}**

This is a problem that is **[exacerbated by an [adversary]{.mark} that
has [proven itself]{.mark}]{.underline}** more than **[[willing to dump
money into capacity]{.mark} that the [U.S.]{.mark} Navy [struggles to
compete with]{.mark}]{.underline}**, said Eric Wertheim, a naval analyst
and author of "Combat Fleets of the World."

"The whole **[[project is]{.mark} one of those [key]{.mark}
areas]{.underline}**, like directed energy, where **[the [U.S.
can]{.mark} [play to its advantage]{.mark} of [leveraging]{.mark}
[tech]{.mark}nology to offset its disadvantages]{.underline}** when
dealing with an adversary like **[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}**," he
said. "**[They just have the ability to [throw]{.mark} large numbers out
there, [large numbers of people to man equipment]{.mark} with, and
[people are]{.mark} among [the most expensive assets]{.mark} for armed
forces]{.underline}** --- especially **[in Western
countries."]{.underline}**

The **[missions that [XLUUV]{.mark}]{.underline}** would be most
well-suited to **[perform]{.underline}** are **[those]{.underline}**
that may be **[[too dangerous for]{.mark} a larger [manned]{.mark}
boat]{.underline}**, he said.

"You might be going into dangerous waters that otherwise you **[might
not want to send manned personnel into]{.underline}**," he said. "But
also, more importantly, is the kind of mission that Orca \[XLUUV\] would
be doing, has the **[potential to [help]{.mark} you [deal with]{.mark}
the kind of [mentally and physically exhausting]{.mark} missions like
[anti-submarine warfare]{.mark}]{.underline}**, mine warfare and
intelligence collection where human senses get dulled over time."

The **[Navy]{.underline}** is also **[developing]{.underline}** a family
of **[unmanned surface vessels that are intended to increase the
offensive punch for less money]{.underline}**, while
**[[increasing]{.underline}]{.mark}** the number of
**[[targets]{.underline}]{.mark}** the **[[Chinese military would have
to locate]{.mark} in a fight]{.underline}**.

Introduction [As a maritime nation, [naval power is the U.S.'s]{.mark}
most useful [means of responding to]{.mark} distant [crises]{.mark},
preventing them from harming our security or that of our allies and
partners, [and keeping]{.mark} geographically remote **[threats from
metastasizing into conflicts]{.mark}** that could approach our borders.
A maritime defense demands a maritime strategy]{.underline}. As national
resources are increasingly strained the need exists for a strategy that
makes deliberate choices to connect ends (security) with means (money
and the fleet it builds). This paper examines the need for a maritime
strategy, discusses options, and offers recommendations for policy
makers. After several decades of unchallenged world leadership, [[the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates once again [faces]{.mark} great power
**[competition]{.mark}**, this time featuring two other world powers.
China and Russia increasingly bristle under the constraints of the
post-World War II systems of global trade, finance, and governance
largely created by the United States and its allies, systems that the
United States has protected and sustained to the economic and security
benefit of its citizens and the citizens of other nations]{.underline}.
Both China and Russia are demonstrably improving the quality of their
armed forces while simultaneously acting aggressively toward neighboring
countries, some of which are US treaty allies[. Additionally, **both
[nations are turning]{.mark} their [attention to naval
operations]{.mark}** far from their own coasts, operations **[designed
to advance]{.mark} national [interests]{.mark} that are [often in
tension with]{.mark} those of [the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates**]{.underline}.1 For the past several decades, US
national security strategy has not had to contend with great powers.
Instead, it has concerned itself primarily with building alliances
designed to manage regional security more efficiently by proxy, while
devoting increasingly more resources to homeland defense and
intelligence aimed at stemming acts of terror by Islamic radical
organizations and their followers. To the extent that the US position of
leadership in the world was not threatened, this strategy was
reasonable, if imperfectly pursued. Such a strategy will no longer
suffice in a world of great power competition, especially one in which
powers of considerable---but unequal---strength are opposed. [Unbalanced
multi-polarity is an especially unstable condition, and the United
States is not effectively postured to manage that instability. Henry
Kissinger divides the concept of world order into two parts: a normative
system that defines acceptable action, and a 'balance of power'
arrangement that punishes the breach of such conventions2.]{.underline}
As the underlying balance of forces shifts, states with different ideas
of international order gain the power to reshape the system.
[Thucydides' ancient insight holds true -- [the rise]{.mark} in power
[of one]{.mark} actor [threatens all]{.mark} others. Where such threat
exists and if the balance of power between states or coalitions
approaches equilibrium, a "Cold War" between competing ideological camps
occurs]{.underline}. In an unbalanced system, the stronger side is
tempted to strike its weaker opponent while the balance of forces is
favorable. Unbridled competition for supremacy defined Europe during its
bloodiest periods. Europe's 16th and 17th century religious wars between
Catholics and Protestants and the global 20th century struggles between
totalitarian ideologies and democracy both represent the natural
end-state of unbalanced multipolar systems. Without norms to restrain
states and force to uphold these norms, violence is very likely. Today's
international system is moving toward unbalanced multi-polarity.
Unfortunately, the United States is not currently prepared to manage
such an international environment. If Americans want to preserve their
nation's secure and prosperous position as the world's great power, the
United States must begin now to prepare strategically for what it will
inevitably face. Otherwise, it will ultimately be forced into an
increasingly limited number of unattractive options to sustain its
position of leadership. There is little evidence that the people of the
United States wish to see our position in the world diminished. The 2016
Presidential Election raised important questions about the degree to
which globalization has served the interests of everyday Americans (and
their perceptions thereof), while the two dominant US political parties
have moved toward more protectionist policies, at least as articulated
by their nominees. Opinion polling indicates the divided nature of the
American public on issues like free trade and sustained foreign
commitments.3 However, Americans remain cognizant of threats to the
United States, and favor maintaining America's position as a great power
by sustaining a strong military.4 Moreover, it would be difficult to
identify meaningful numbers of Americans who would sacrifice national
security in favor of increased social spending, despite the continuing
rise in non-discretionary spending in the federal budget. Americans
understand that the US position of world leadership benefits the
nation's economy, its security, its allies, and the international order
that has been the object of US foreign and defense policy for over a
century. They know that their lives would be diminished if this position
of global leadership were surrendered to an adversary or group of them.
The paradox of the American experience is that the US is not simply a
great power -- it is an exceptional power, for which ideals count as
much as strength. The American public, despite its aversion to foreign
commitments, can rise to the occasion and respond to clear threats, as
it has in both World Wars, the Cold War, and after September 11th. The
job of the policymaker, therefore, is to ensure America remains a great
power, so that when the occasion arises, it can act as an exceptional
power[. It is critical then, for US political leaders to begin thinking
more strategically about protecting and [advancing America\'s position
in the face of growing great power competition]{.mark}. This monograph
asserts that a strategy to support such a goal [would]{.mark}
necessarily [be maritime]{.mark} in nature, [leveraging]{.mark} this
nation's great [**geographical advantages**]{.mark} in the service of
its national power.]{.underline} Sharing land borders with only two
nations---both of whom are friendly to the United States---and
[[separated **from other great powers by vast oceans**]{.mark}, [the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates enjoys a security position quite unlike
that of any other nation.]{.underline} For over a century, it has been
the unspoken (but doggedly pursued) national security aim of the United
States to [[ensure]{.mark} that [no power rise]{.mark} to prominence [in
Asia or Europe]{.mark} so as to occupy a position there as dominant as
the United States' position in the Western Hemisphere. Were this to
occur, not only could [that]{.mark} nation then [lock the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [out of]{.mark} the resources and activity of [that
region]{.mark}, but it could also then eventually turn its attention to
challenging our position in the Western Hemisphere]{.underline}.5
Underlying this approach is the reality that most the world's activity
does not occur in our own hemisphere, but in Asia and Europe. American
interests in these regions--- political, diplomatic, economic, and
military---are considerable and growing. Protecting and sustaining those
interests must remain a priority of American policy, and maritime
strategy is an effective tool in doing so. Maritime strategy is a subset
of grand strategy, and the relationship between the two is ably defined
by Professor John B. Hattendorf of the Naval War College: "In its
broadest sense, grand strategy is the comprehensive direction of power
to achieve particular national goals. Within those terms, maritime
strategy is the direction of all aspects of national power that relate
to a nation's interests at sea. The navy serves this purpose, but
maritime strategy is not purely a naval preserve. Maritime strategy
involves the other functions of state power that include diplomacy; the
safety and defence of merchant trade at sea; fishing; the exploitation,
conservation, regulation and defence of the exclusive economic zone at
sea; coastal defence; security of national borders; the protection of
offshore islands; as well as participation in regional and world-wide
concerns relating to the use of oceans, the skies over the oceans and
the land under the seas.6 [It is wholly [appropriate for the world's
dominant naval power]{.mark}---separated from its widely-flung interests
by thousands of miles of open ocean---**[to develop and execute coherent
maritime strategy]{.mark}**. In a time of re-emerging great power
competition, it is essential. The nation's current maritime strategy 7
is, unfortunately, not up to the task. It focuses insufficiently on
great power competition; it does not recognize the rise in importance of
conventional forces in deterring great power war; it does not provide a
theory of conventional deterrence appropriate to great powers and their
likely objectives; it does not suggest **a posture for naval forces
[that acts as an effective deterrent]{.mark}**; its derived force
structure is too small and short on effective logistic support; it does
not place sufficient value on naval partnerships with geographically
important nations which may not be traditional partners; and it is
silent on the need for the nation to invest in a maritime industrial
base that can enable an appropriate strategy.]{.underline} This
monograph urges new thinking about maritime strategy, a strategy
compatible with the United States' responsibilities as the leader of the
free world, as well as the world's premier political, military,
economic, and diplomatic power. Such a strategy would seek to protect
and sustain those leadership positions in the face of renewed great
power competition, competition that largely subsumes other, lesser
security concerns. There will be those who view this approach as a
return to "Cold War" strategic thinking, and we do not shy from this
comparison. [The United States acted for decades as a coherent strategic
actor when faced with expansionist Soviet totalitarianism, and it [must
act with]{.mark} equal coherence and [resolve to contest]{.mark} China
and Russia's brands of [aggressive]{.mark} mercantilism, regional
[expansion]{.mark}, and contempt for established global
order.]{.underline} There will be those who evaluate our suggestions in
this paper and conclude that the nation cannot afford it, that the
expense associated with moving to a maritime grand strategy would
imbalance the traditional "ends, ways, means" approach to the making of
strategy. And while the ends, ways, means approach is generally relevant
to military and operational strategy, it is unsuited to the making of
grand strategy for one very important reason. Unlike subordinate levels
of strategy, grand strategy re-allocates, realigns, and re-orients a
nation's "means" to serve strategic "ends". Military strategy starts
with the proposition that there is a certain resource level available to
pursue its ends. Grand strategy starts with the sum of the nation's
output capacity, and then determines how it can most effectively be
allocated to the achievement of strategic goals. Short of war itself,
there is nothing in American history that causes strategic realignment
more reliably than a change in Administration, and we wish to be part of
that dialogue. We argue here for a new theory of deterrence, one that
revises the Cold War approach in which the Soviet Union was deterred
from large-scale conventional attack by the threat of nuclear
escalation. Under that rubric, one could justifiably say that America's
conventional deterrent was dependent on its strategic deterrent. Today,
the decapitating "bolt from the blue" strike is even more remote than it
was in the Cold War, and to the extent that nuclear exchange between
great powers is conceivable, it is far more likely to flow from
conventional conflict that has gone awry. Therefore, to deter nuclear
war, we must deter conventional war. [[No aspect of]{.mark} American
military [power will be more critical to deterring]{.mark} either
[**nuclear**]{.mark} or conventional super-power]{.underline} **[[war
than seapower.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

**[Compared to air and land forces, [maritime
power]{.mark}]{.underline}** has two inter-related characteristics that
make it **[[particularly useful to]{.underline}]{.mark}** the modern
conventional (as well as nuclear) **[[deterrence]{.underline}]{.mark}**
mission: • **[Maritime forces can [project and sustain
forward-deployed]{.mark}, [combat-credible power]{.mark} in peacetime,
crises, and war]{.underline}** • **[[Maritime power is minimally
intrusive]{.underline}]{.mark}**; in other words**[, it does not require
a footprint on land]{.underline}** The fact that naval forces can
"loiter" and be minimally intrusive is an important and **[unique
contribution to deterrence]{.underline}**. The Army can loiter, but it
cannot be minimally intrusive; the Air Force can be minimally intrusive
(although, because it still needs some land-based infrastructure, it is
more intrusive than maritime forces), but it cannot loiter. Only naval
forces can do both simultaneously. These unique **[characteristics
are]{.underline}** likely to be especially **[useful for conventional
deterrence]{.underline}**. Given that an adversary is likely to pay
close attention to the local balance of power, **[naval
forces]{.underline}** are important because they **[can [rapidly respond
to an emerging crisis]{.mark} by bringing U.S. combat power to places
where none existed before]{.underline}**, or by augmenting existing
forces already in theater to further swing the local power balance in
the United States' favor. **[The [ability to quickly deploy]{.mark},
[and]{.mark} indefinitely [sustain]{.mark},
[power]{.mark}]{.underline}** in a region helps **[ensure that an
opponent cannot]{.underline}** hope to **[wait out U.S.
forces]{.underline}** in the belief that at some point there will be a
favorable "window of opportunity" for aggression. **[The ability to
sustain minimally intrusive power can be a valuable asset in both
general and immediate deterrence]{.underline}** (Phases 0 and 1). In
Phase 0, **[continual yet mobile forward presence]{.underline}** can
**[[give]{.mark} friends and [allies]{.mark} the [assurances]{.mark}
they desire]{.underline}** without requiring an expensive and
politically sensitive permanent presence on land. Repeated peacetime
engagements with regional partners, combined with the knowledge that
combat-credible U.S. military power is always relatively nearby if
trouble arises, can both assure allies and deter adversaries. **[Naval
power's [unobtrusiveness]{.mark} is also [useful for]{.mark} crisis
management]{.underline}** in Phase 1 and for compellence **[and
[escalation control]{.mark}]{.underline}** in Phase 2. In an acute
crisis, t**[he Navy can be the optimal mechanism to [signal credible
deterrence without]{.mark} also unnecessarily [provoking the
adversary]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[Naval forces can]{.underline}** get
close enough to the possible combat area to **[[communicate credible
threats]{.mark} of prompt denial and/or punishment, [while]{.mark} at
the same time [not getting so close that the leadership fears an
impending]{.mark} U.S. [attack and decides to strike
first]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This is also useful in Phase 2, as efforts
to employ compellence and signal escalation dominance (which, as
discussed earlier, is an important mechanism of escalation control) run
the risk of inadvertently triggering the actions that we hoped to
prevent. Although this risk cannot be completely avoided in Phase 2,
naval forces can, at least, sustain a visible presence in the theater to
signal the threat of additional costs without having to be stationed too
close to the immediate battlespace.

The Trump administration's [actions on the question of the U.S.
Navy]{.underline}'s future [will be the single most consequential policy
decision of the]{.underline} next four years, if not the next
[decade]{.underline}. [Its decisions will affect our national security,
if not our national survival --- and with those, the fate of the world
as well.]{.underline} Human inconsistency frustrates the study of
politics. Each [civilization has created distinct forms of political
order based on different concepts of legitimacy and
justice]{.underline}. This fact makes universal criteria for morality or
legitimacy difficult. As Germany's "Iron Chancellor" Otto von Bismarck
noted in an 1863 example of gross understatement, "politics is not an
exact science." However, [international relations are governed by a
handful of laws that manifest themselves consistently throughout
history]{.underline}. [The most important]{.underline} of these [is that
power balances power, and rising actors will resent the hierarchy
imposed by a more powerful hegemon]{.underline}. These laws apply best
to [great powers]{.underline} --- those states that [determine the
stability or instability of a system]{.underline} through their
application of coercive economic, military and political power. Not only
are [these powers]{.underline} the only major threats to one another,
they [are the only actors in the system with the capability to impose
their political and moral framework on others]{.underline}. [When great
powers compete, they clash over both material interests and competing
value systems]{.underline}. Structural hierarchy can mitigate
great-power competition. The overwhelming strength of one actor wards
off challenges, while the stability this power provides encourages
systemic economic prosperity. This explains the economic prosperity and
international stability that followed America's emergence as the single
most powerful state in the international system after 1991. Yet, power
shifts with time. The American economic advantage that translated into
political dominance has dissipated, leaving the U.S. as a global leader,
but not absent rivals. China has used integration into the
American-created international economic system to supercharge its own
economic growth. Moreover, [economic growth is not the only factor in
current structural shifts ---]{.underline} [military power is the
highest-value currency in great-power competition]{.underline}. Despite
its economic instability, [Russia has emerged as a formidable military
adversary, with a collection of capabilities designed to control
conflict escalation, and a select few high-end systems designed to match
their American counterparts and increase the cost of full-scale
warfare.]{.underline} [Smaller actors also use specific military
capabilities to give them outsized relevance; Iran's irregular forces
and North Korea's nuclear weapons afford them leverage over an
increasingly overstretched U.S. military. Iran, Russia and North Korea
cause significant strategic problems for the U.S.]{.underline} However,
China is America's greatest rival. [The Moscow-Tehran axis can pressure
the NATO alliance's eastern flank and attack America's Middle Eastern
allies and partners, and the nuclear-armed Kim family regime can engage
in apocalyptic Russian roulette]{.underline}, but only China has the
structural economic power to eliminate and replace the present global
order. China's first step in this project is dominating the
Asia-Pacific. [America's international system requires unimpeded freedom
of trade and navigation.]{.underline} Not only does [the West's economic
structure require significant material imports and exports, but
America's international alliance and base network is untenable absent
communication and transport over vast distances]{.underline}. [A
Chinese-dominated Pacific would give Beijing a stranglehold over trade
flows to, and communication with, critical American regional allies like
Japan, South Korea and Australia]{.underline}. With the South and East
China Seas functioning as China's private lakes, [Chinese President Xi
Jinping could force his American counterpart to choose between fighting
a major war to regain control of the Pacific or allowing the elimination
of today's international system, and accepting significant Chinese
revision]{.underline}. [Naval forces are therefore the most important
military variable in this Sino-American rivalry. A strong U.S. Navy and
Marine Corps is essential to maintaining freedom of navigation, ensuring
effective security relations with allies, deterring enemy escalation
and, in the event of a confrontation, neutralizing any threat with
overwhelming firepower. To put it more broadly, the prerequisite for an
international order, especially a liberal one that depends on free trade
and unmolested global commerce, is naval dominance]{.underline}. [Ours
is at risk]{.underline}. U.S. naval forces have been in decline since
the end of the Cold War. The current 275-ship, 10 capital-ship fleet is
a far cry from the 594-ship, 17 capital-ship fleet of the 1980s. To
fulfill America's defense commitments and deter its adversaries, a
350-ship fleet is critical. [Fleet diversity is necessary -- submarines
are needed for long-term war-fighting punch, aircraft carriers for
operational flexibility, surface combatants for deterrence patrols and
forward presence, and amphibious ships for operations against critical
maritime strong-points]{.underline} --- as is a robust Marine Corps that
is 190,000-200,000 strong. During the 2016 campaign, Trump promised to
rebuild U.S. naval capacity, particularly by expanding the Navy to 350
ships. Notwithstanding, the president's National Security Strategy (NSS)
is silent on the goal and how to reach it. The NSS's focus on high-end
great-power competition is an important step in the right direction, but
without explicit recognition of the force structure needed to win such a
contest, this shift in policy is meaningless. In his State of the Union
address, the president justifiably asked Congress to end the defense
sequester and fully fund the U.S. military. This is necessary, but does
not answer the question: Will President Trump ask Congress for the money
to build a 350-ship Navy, and will he fight for it? Playing catch-up
with a Chinese navy projected to break 400 ships by 2030 after another
decade and a half of U[.S. military stagnation is not an
option]{.underline}. [No lapsed great power has ever recovered its
position. A substantive imbalance in forces could tempt
China]{.underline} (or China together with other adversaries) [to strike
first against a U.S. that belatedly seeks to regain hard power, leading
to, at best, a multi-year war or, at worst, the destruction of the U.S.
Pacific Fleet or a nuclear exchange.]{.underline} Structure helps
dictate the general shape and direction of international politics.
However, [China's rise --- and America's decline --- are not
inevitable]{.underline}. Economic conditions can fluctuate for good or
ill, and the rise of Artificial Intelligence and economic automation can
reshape the international economic landscape in the next decade[.
Military power is the best instrument to ensure the U.S. national
position, safeguard the international order it has created, and preserve
the Western values on which its political structure rests. The U.S. has
the capacity to rebuild its military forces, deter its adversaries, and
defend its interests. But without political will for such measures, the
prospects for America's continued pre-eminence are dim.]{.underline} The
challenge that faces both this administration and its successors is how
to harness the nation's will.

**[Even as the private sector and academia have made rapid progress
in]{.underline}** the field of Artificial Intelligence (**[AI) and
Machine Learning]{.underline}** (ML), the Department of Defense (**[DoD)
remains hamstrung by significant technical and policy
challenges]{.underline}**. Only a fraction of this civilian-driven
progress can be applied to the AI and ML models and systems needed by
the DoD; **[the uniquely military]{.underline}** operational
**[environments]{.underline}** and modes of employment **[create unique
development challenges]{.underline}** for these potentially dominant
systems. In order for ML systems to be successful once fielded, these
issues must be considered now. **[The problems of dataset curation, data
scarcity, updating models, and trust between humans and machines will
challenge engineers]{.underline}** in their efforts to create accurate,
reliable, and relevant AI/ML systems. Recent studies recognize these
structural challenges. A GAO report found that only 38 percent of
private sector research and development projects were aligned with DoD
needs, while only 12 percent of projects could be categorized as AI or
autonomy research.1 The National Security Commission on Artificial
Intelligence's Final Report also recognizes this gap, recommending more
federal R&D funding for areas critical to advance technology, especially
those that may not receive private sector investment.2 The sea services
face particular challenges in adopting AI/ML technologies to their
domains because private sector interest and investment in AI and
autonomy at sea has been especially limited. **[One particular
area]{.underline}** **[that needs Navy-specific
investment]{.underline}** **[is]{.underline}** that of **[ML systems for
passive sonar]{.underline}** systems, though the approach certainly has
application to other ML systems. Why Sonar is in Particular Need of
Investment **[Passive sonar systems are]{.underline}** **[a critical
component on many naval platforms today]{.underline}**. **[Passive sonar
listens for sounds emitted by ships or submarines and is the preferred
tool of anti-submarine warfare]{.underline}**, particularly for
localizing and tracking targets. **[In contrast to active sonar, no
signal is emitted]{.underline}**, making it more covert and the method
of choice for submarines to locate other vessels at sea. Passive sonar
systems are used across the Navy in submarine, surface, and naval air
assets, and in constant use during peace and war to locate and track
adversary submarines. Because of this widespread use, any ML model for
passive sonar systems would have a significant impact across the fleet
and use on both manned and unmanned platforms. These models could easily
integrate into traditional manned platforms to ease the cognitive load
on human operators. They could also increase the autonomy of unmanned
platforms, either surfaced or submerged, by giving these platforms the
same abilities that manned platforms have to detect, track, and classify
targets in passive sonar data.

**[The American way of war centers on its ability to project
power]{.underline}** at great distances, **[across the
spectrum]{.underline}** **[of warfighting domains and in the face of
growing adversary capabilities]{.underline}**. In this context, **[it is
difficult to overstate the importance of the maritime component of the
U.S. defense posture]{.underline}**. Since the earliest days of the
republic, the United States has been a seafaring nation, championing
freedom of navigation, protecting sea lines of communication, and
fielding an effective expeditionary naval capability. **[For several
decades, the Navy has proven adept and resilient in the undersea
domain]{.underline}**. **[And]{.underline}** **[undersea
dominance]{.underline}**---the ability of the silent service to

Department of Defense (**[DoD]{.underline}**) **[depends]{.underline}**
**[heavily]{.underline}** **[on submarines for both deterrence and power
projection.1 Yet]{.underline}**, **[a combination of growing foreign
capabilities]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}** emerging **[U.S. force

what]{.underline}** Deputy Secretary of Defense Robert
**[Work]{.underline}** **[calls the "away game" operations that are
central to conventional deterrence]{.underline}**.2 "**[There is an
awful lot of competition]{.underline}**," Chief of Naval Operations
Admiral John Richardson observed in August 2016, "**[so we can't get
complacent, we can't rest on our laurels for one minute, otherwise that
window will close and we'll find that they've achieved parity
undersea]{.underline}**."3 While emerging security competitors do not
boast the roughly 250-submarine fleet of the Soviet Union, their
undersea warfighting prowess is arguably greater.4 **[Contemporary
nuclear]{.underline}** (SSN) **[and]{.underline}** diesel-electric (SSK)
**[attack submarines in the Russian and Chinese inventories are much
quieter than their Soviet-era predecessors]{.underline}**, **[as are the
nuclear ballistic missile]{.underline}** (SSBN) **[submarines fielded by
each.]{.underline}** (**[A lower acoustic profile]{.underline}** reduces
a defender's antisubmarine warfare options and therefore **[enhances
platform survivability]{.underline}**.) **[They are also comparatively
more lethal]{.underline}**: modern SSNs and SSKs, together with
guided-missile (SSGN) submarines, offer long-range antiship and/or
land-attack cruise missile capabilities, even as classic naval offensive
weapons including torpedoes and sea mines remain in play. In practice,

U.S. undersea presence is notably smaller than the roughly 100-
submarine attack fleet fielded at the height of the Reagan-era
buildup.]{.underline}**5 The Navy's existing requirement for 48 attack
submarines was set in 2006, "before the reemergence of the Russian fleet
and before China became a factor beneath the waves,"6 considerations
influencing the revised---but not yet released---force-structure
assessment of October 2016.7 And **[the trend line is
unfavorable]{.underline}**, **[with anticipated reductions in the
quantity of the current U.S. force complement of attack, ballistic and
guided-missile submarines slated for the next several
years]{.underline}**. And while the United States appears to maintain a
qualitative edge, **[the growing inventory of modern Russian and Chinese
submarines are highly capable and appear to have closed much of the
legacy performance gap]{.underline}**. Thus, **[even as DoD senior

**[Implications for the United States]{.underline}**

**[A [wider European conflict]{.mark} would pose the [stiffest challenge
to]{.mark} the global [standing of the]{.mark} United States [\[US\]
since the]{.mark} end of the [Cold War]{.mark} and to the [international
system]{.mark} it has built and underwritten for [decades
longer]{.mark}.]{.underline}** It would **[[test]{.mark} the durability
of its global system of [alliances]{.mark} and the [efficacy of
international regimes]{.mark} and institutions that have guarded world
peace]{.underline}**, **[security, and prosperity]{.underline}**. The
**[challenge would come [at a time when the]{.mark} United States
\[[US]{.mark}\] itself is in immense disarray]{.underline}**, as a
**[[deeply polarized polity]{.mark} confronts massive domestic
problems---]{.underline}**the **[pandemic, inflation, racial justice,
and cultural wars]{.underline}**---**[that [leave less time and fewer
resources for foreign matters]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The United States
will be tested to see whether it can muster the will, energy, and
creativity to execute an effective policy toward the unfolding crisis in
Europe.

**[At home, public attention has been focused on developments in and
around Ukraine]{.underline}**, but the Joe **[[Biden]{.mark}
administration [cannot ignore the home front]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In
response to U.S.-levied sanctions, **[[Russia]{.mark} can be expected to
[step up its cyber op]{.mark}eration[s]{.mark} against the United
States]{.underline}**. It will more actively **[[sow
disinformation]{.mark}, seek to [exacerbate domestic tension]{.mark}s,
and]{.underline} ~~paralyze~~ [[\[inhibit\] critical
infrastructure]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The severity of the attacks will
likely rise in proportion to the harshness of the sanctions Washington
levies on Moscow.

Abroad, **[[the fate of the transatlantic community]{.mark}, a central
pillar of U.S. security and prosperity, [would be a
stake]{.mark}]{.underline}**. One of the Biden administration's
priorities, as laid out in the Interim National Security Strategy
Guidance released in March 2021, is repairing U.S.
alliances---especially with Europe---after four disruptive years under
President Donald Trump. Although relations are more cordial, significant
substantive differences remain and the willingness of allies to align
behind a common purpose for the long haul remains questionable.

The United States' allies have rallied behind a harsh set of sanctions
in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but **[[preserving
unity]{.mark} as the conflict drags on [remains a challenge]{.mark},
especially if sacrifice is spread unevenly across NATO, as will likely
be the case. [Putin]{.mark} will seek to [exploit divisions]{.mark}
through differentiated levels of pressure on NATO members, targeted
energy cutoffs, offers of negotiation, and the like to most
[advance]{.mark} two long-standing Russian goals: the [end of
NATO]{.mark} as a collective defense organization [and]{.mark} the
[erosion of]{.mark} the foundations of [the EU]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
Should he succeed, **[the [new orde]{.mark}r]{.underline}** that would
emerge in Europe is far from certain. But **[[Russia]{.mark} would
undoubtedly [play a central role]{.mark} in its formulation, and almost
any conceivable new order would [diminish the power and role of
the]{.mark} United States \[[US]{.mark}\] on the
continent.]{.underline}**

**[A similar situation obtains in the [Indo-Pacific]{.mark}
region]{.underline}**. The **[[Biden]{.mark} administration spent 2021
[bolstering relations with]{.mark} its allies and
partners]{.underline}**---energizing **[[the Quad]{.underline}]{.mark}**
(the United States, Australia, India, and Japan), and **[cutting a
submarine deal with the United Kingdom and Australia---[to mee]{.mark}t
the growing strategic challenge posed by [China]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
A **[major, [prolonged]{.mark} European [distraction]{.mark} could
[undo]{.mark} further efforts to [pivot to Asia]{.mark}, [raise doubts
among allies]{.mark} and partners [about]{.mark} the
[cred]{.mark}ibility [of the U.S]{.mark}. commitment, and [free China to
pursue its objectives with greater vigor. The]{.mark} United States
\[[US]{.mark}\] could [avoid this outcome by]{.mark}]{.underline}**
pursuing lesser goals in Europe---leading to the quicker development of
a new order less favorable to American interests---or by **[[a massive
buildup of]{.mark} its [military capabilities]{.mark} that would enable
it to play a major, perhaps decisive, role in both
regions]{.underline}**. The latter would have to come at the cost of the
Biden administration's domestic priorities. Whether the Biden
administration could muster sufficient domestic political support, if it
decided to move in this direction, is far from certain.

In addition to regional challenges, **[a major [European
conflict]{.mark} would also [stress]{.mark} critical [international
regimes]{.mark} and institutions]{.underline}**. One of the first
victims would likely be the **[[arms control]{.mark}
regime]{.underline}** that has served as the foundation of strategic
nuclear stability for the past fifty-plus years. The United States
withdrew from some central elements---including **[the Anti-Ballistic
Missiles (ABM) and the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF)
treaties]{.underline}**---but two critical elements have remained in
place: the New START treaty and the Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT). **[A
wider conflict in Europe would all but [guarantee]{.mark} that the
United States and Russia could [no]{.mark}t agree to a
[follow-on]{.mark} treaty [to]{.mark} the [New START]{.mark} treaty
before it expires in 2026, and the NPT review conference tentatively
scheduled for August 2022 would fall by the wayside]{.underline}**. As a
consequence, the incipient arms race now underway, fueled by new
technologies---hypersonics, cyber tools, and artificial
intelligence---would accelerate. **[[A new wave of nuclear
prolif]{.mark}eration [could ensue]{.mark}, especially if U.S. allies
and partners lose faith in America's commitment to extended
deterrence.]{.underline}** Mutually assured destruction, which for
better or worse has anchored strategic stability since the early 1970s,
would be severely stressed in a multipolar nuclear landscape with Russia
and the United States fighting at least a proxy war.

Likewise, **[a [broader conflict]{.mark} in Europe [would
stress]{.mark},]{.underline}** perhaps to the breaking point,
**[[the]{.mark} United Nations \[[UN]{.mark}\] and many of its auxiliary
organizations]{.underline}**. Already stymied by a growing rift between
the Western permanent members and Russia and China, the Security Council
would have failed in its primary reason for being---to prevent the
outbreak of a major conflict in Europe. It could continue to exist as a
forum for the airing of grievances and acrimonious debate, but it would
serve little purpose as a platform for addressing major global issues.

Finally, **[the humanitarian costs of a wider conflict in Europe would
be staggering]{.underline}**, particularly given the destructiveness of
modern weapons. Beyond the physical destruction and loss of life, untold
numbers of refugees would flow across borders not only into Central East
Europe but perhaps further West depending on the scale of the fighting.
**[The strain on the socioeconomic systems]{.underline}**---coming on
top of the stress of the two-year-old pandemic, economic dislocation,
and mounting inflation---**[could bring some close to
collapse.]{.underline}**

**Harari '18** \[Yuval; September 26; Professor of History at Hebrew
University of Jerusalem; \"We need a post-liberal order now,\"
https://www.economist.com/open-future/2018/09/26/we-need-a-post-liberal-order-now\]

**[If the liberal order is collapsing, what new kind of global order
might [replace]{.mark} it?]{.underline}** So far, **[those who challenge
[the liberal order]{.mark}]{.underline}** do so mainly on a national
level. They have many ideas about how to advance the interests of their
particular country, but they **[don't have a viable vision for how the
world as a whole should function]{.underline}**. For example, Russian
nationalism can be a reasonable guide for running the affairs of Russia,
but Russian nationalism has no plan for the rest of humanity. Unless, of
course, nationalism morphs into imperialism, and calls for one nation to
conquer and rule the entire world. A century ago, several nationalist
movements indeed harboured such imperialist fantasies. Today's
nationalists, whether in Russia, Turkey, Italy or China, so far refrain
from advocating global conquest.

In place of violently establishing a global empire, **[some
nationalists]{.underline}** such as Steve Bannon, Viktor Orban, the
Northern League in Italy and the British Brexiteers dream about a
peaceful "Nationalist International". They **[argue]{.underline}** that
all nations today face the same enemies. The bogeymen of globalism,
multiculturalism and immigration are threatening to destroy the
traditions and identities of all nations. Therefore nationalists across
the world should make common cause in opposing these global forces.
Hungarians, Italians, Turks and Israelis should build walls, erect
fences and slow down the movement of people, goods, money and ideas.

**[The world will]{.underline}** then **[be divided into distinct
nation-states]{.underline}**, each with its own sacred identity and
traditions. Based on mutual respect for these differing identities, all
nation-states could cooperate and trade peacefully with one another.
Hungary will be Hungarian, Turkey will be Turkish, Israel will be
Israeli, and everyone will know who they are and what is their proper
place in the world. It will be a world without immigration, without
universal values, without multiculturalism, and without a global
elite---but with peaceful international relations and some trade. In a
word, **[the "Nationalist International" envisions the world as a
network of walled-but-friendly fortresses]{.underline}**.

Many people would think this is quite a reasonable vision. Why isn't it
a viable alternative to the liberal order? Two things should be noted
about it. First, it is still a comparatively liberal vision. It assumes
that no human group is superior to all others, that no nation should
dominate its peers, and that international cooperation is better than
conflict. In fact, liberalism and nationalism were originally closely
aligned with one another. The 19th century liberal nationalists, such as
Giuseppe Garibaldi and Giuseppe Mazzini in Italy, and Adam Mickiewicz in
Poland, dreamt about precisely such an international liberal order of
peacefully-coexisting nations.

The second thing to note about **[this vision of friendly
fortresses]{.underline}** is that it **[has been
tried]{.underline}**---**[and it failed spectacularly. All attempts to
divide the world into clear-cut nations have]{.underline}** so far
**[[resulted in war]{.mark} and genocide]{.underline}**. When the heirs
of Garibaldi, Mazzini and Mickiewicz managed to overthrow the
multi-ethnic Habsburg Empire, it proved impossible to find a clear line
dividing Italians from Slovenes or Poles from Ukrainians.

This had set the stage for the second world war. The key problem with
the network of fortresses is that each national fortress wants a bit
more land, security and prosperity for itself at the expense of the
neighbors, and without the help of universal values and global
organisations, rival fortresses cannot agree on any common rules. Walled
fortresses are seldom friendly.

But if you happen to live inside a particularly strong fortress, such as
America or Russia, why should you care? Some nationalists indeed adopt a
more extreme isolationist position. They don't believe in either a
global empire or in a global network of fortresses. Instead, **[they
deny the necessity of any global order whatsoever]{.underline}**. "Our
fortress should just raise the drawbridges," they say, "and the rest of
the world can go to hell. We should refuse entry to foreign people,
foreign ideas and foreign goods, and as long as our walls are stout and
the guards are loyal, who cares what happens to the foreigners?"

Such extreme isolationism, however, is completely divorced from economic
realities. Without a global trade network, all existing national
economies will collapse---including that of North Korea. Many countries
will not be able even to feed themselves without imports, and prices of
almost all products will skyrocket. The made-in-China shirt I am wearing
cost me about \$5. If it had been produced by Israeli workers from
Israeli-grown cotton using Israeli-made machines powered by non-existing
Israeli oil, it may well have cost ten times as much. Nationalist
leaders from Donald Trump to Vladimir Putin may therefore heap abuse on
the global trade network, but none thinks seriously of taking their
country completely out of that network. And we cannot have a global
trade network without some global order that sets the rules of the game.

Even more importantly, whether people like it or not,
**[[humankind]{.underline}]{.mark}** today
**[[faces]{.underline}]{.mark}** three **[common [problems]{.mark} that
make a mockery of all national borders]{.underline}**, and **[that can
[only]{.mark} be [solved through]{.mark} global [cooperation]{.mark}.
These are [nuclear war, climate change and tech]{.mark}nological
disruption. You cannot build a wall against nuclear winter or against
global warming, and no nation can regulate]{.underline}** artificial
intelligence (**[AI) or bioengineering single-handedly]{.underline}**.
It won't be enough if only the European Union forbids producing killer
robots or only America bans genetically-engineering human babies. Due to
the immense potential of such disruptive technologies, if even one
country decides to pursue these high-risk high-gain paths, other
countries will be forced to follow its dangerous lead for fear of being
left behind.

**[[An AI]{.mark} arms race [or]{.mark} a [biotech]{.mark}nological
[arms race]{.mark}]{.underline}** almost **[[guarantees]{.mark} the
worst outcome. Whoever wins]{.underline}** the arms race, **[the loser
will likely be [humanity]{.mark} itself]{.underline}**. For in an arms
race, **[all regulations [will collapse]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Consider, for example, conducting genetic-engineering experiments on
human babies. Every country will say: "We don't want to conduct such
experiments---we are the good guys. But how do we know our rivals are
not doing it? We cannot afford to remain behind. So we must do it before
them."

Similarly, **[consider developing autonomous-weapon
systems]{.underline}**, that can decide for themselves whether to shoot
and kill people. Again, **[every country will say: "This]{.underline}**
is a very dangerous technology, and it **[should be
regulated]{.underline}** carefully. **[But we don't trust our rivals to
regulate it, so we must develop it first]{.underline}**".

**[The only thing that can prevent]{.underline}** such **[destructive
arms races is [greater trust]{.mark} between countries. This [is
not]{.mark} an [impossible]{.mark} mission]{.underline}**. If today the
Germans promise the French: "Trust us, we aren't developing killer
robots in a secret laboratory under the Bavarian Alps," the French are
likely to believe the Germans, despite the terrible history of these two
countries. **[We need to build such trust globally]{.underline}**. We
need to reach a point when Americans and Chinese can trust one another
like the French and Germans.

Similarly, we need to create a global safety-net to protect humans
against the economic shocks that AI is likely to cause. Automation will
create immense new wealth in high-tech hubs such as Silicon Valley,
while the worst effects will be felt in developing countries whose
economies depend on cheap manual labor. There will be more jobs to
software engineers in California, but fewer jobs to Mexican factory
workers and truck drivers. We now have a global economy, but politics is
still very national. **[Unless we find solutions on a global level to
the disruptions caused by AI, entire countries might collapse, and the
resulting chaos]{.underline}**, violence and waves of immigration
**[will destabilise the entire world]{.underline}**.

This is the proper perspective to look at recent developments such as
Brexit. In itself, Brexit isn't necessarily a bad idea. But is this what
Britain and the EU should be dealing with right now? How does Brexit
help prevent nuclear war? How does Brexit help prevent climate change?
How does Brexit help regulate artificial intelligence and
bioengineering? Instead of helping, Brexit makes it harder to solve all
of these problems. Every minute that Britain and the EU spend on Brexit
is one less minute they spend on preventing climate change and on
regulating AI.

In order **[[to survive]{.underline}]{.mark}** and flourish **[in the
21st century, [humankind needs]{.mark} effective global
[cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and so far **[[the only]{.mark}
viable [blueprint]{.mark} for such cooperation [is]{.mark} offered by
[liberalism]{.mark}. Nevertheless, governments all over the world are
undermining the foundations of the liberal order]{.underline}**, and the
world is turning into a network of fortresses. **[The first to feel the

The "**[Forgotten Waters" exercise revealed]{.underline}** a **[lack of
familiarity with the GIUK Gap:]{.underline}** **[geographically,
strategically, and tactically]{.underline}**. It provided CNAS analysts
and participants with several important insights about hybrid threats,
the **[critical role of]{.underline}** Iceland, **[intelligence
sharing]{.underline}**, disparities among NATO states,
**[and]{.underline}** **[NATO decision-making]{.underline}**.
Particularly in its third move, which involved a more conventional set
of military threats, the exercise exposed **[numerous gaps
in]{.underline}** **[military capability and capacity]{.underline}**
**[as well as technical shortfalls]{.underline}**. Here, we focus first
on strategic issues, and then on alliance issues, that the exercise
highlighted.

Strategic and Planning Challenges

CNAS decided to host a tabletop exercise on the GIUK Gap because, as the
name of the exercise suggests, **[allies have forgotten]{.underline}**
why it is necessary, as well as **[how to operate there.]{.underline}**
At the end of the Cold War, NATO understandably turned away from the
North Atlantic to focus on expeditionary operations of growing
importance in places like the Balkans, Afghanistan, and Iraq. "Forgotten
Waters" held true to its name even before the exercise got underway:
CNAS staff often had to explain to potential participants and supporters
where the GIUK Gap was located, how Alliance naval activity in the gap
had atrophied in recent years, and why this Cold War hot spot has been
creeping back into focus. As the Alliance has returned to its core
mission of collective security in the wake of Russia's illegal
annexation of Crimea in 2014, many of NATO's recent efforts have focused
on the vulnerability of the Baltic States and Poland.

During the game, **[participants']{.underline}** questions and comments
also **[demonstrated]{.underline}** a **[lack of familiarity with NATO's
crisis management procedures]{.underline}**. As they **[grappled
with]{.underline}** everything from **[electronic warfare to a collision
between a surface ship]{.underline}** and a **[submarine to a breach in
an undersea cable,]{.underline}** players sought information on what was
illegal, **[what types of activities could be considered "normal," what
procedures]{.underline}** were in place to **[cope with specific
scenarios,]{.underline}** and **[how much they could "see" below the
surface]{.underline}**. While some players had been selected because of
their pre-existing interest in and knowledge of the GIUK Gap, most
players left the game with a much deeper understanding of this strategic
corner of the North Atlantic.

In addition to exposing a general lack of familiarity with the GIUK Gap,
"Forgotten Waters" showed participants how a **[hybrid threat affecting
the internal politics of a NATO ally could be a great disruptor to
transatlantic unity, resolve, and action.]{.underline}** In the second
move, for example, players were told that a disinformation campaign in
Iceland (assumed to be stemming from Russia) had altered the outcome of
that country's national election, putting into power a leader intent on
reducing the U.S. military presence in Iceland. Players faced a string
of complicated challenges: the need to expose and counter the
disinformation campaign, the need to maintain and fortify alliance
unity, and the need to develop alternative basing options for U.S. P-8
ASW patrol aircraft.

**[Responses by NATO and national governments]{.underline}** to the
disinformation scenarios **[often lacked imagination.]{.underline}**
Whereas in other parts of the exercise, participants would study their
orders of battle (documents outlining the military forces they could
deploy or use in a crisis), in Move 2, facing an aggressive
disinformation or cyber campaign, there was no "order of battle" that
participants could consult. The Alliance did dispatch the Secretary
General and SACEUR to Iceland to try to persuade the new Icelandic
leader to maintain close ties to NATO and its members. NATO also issued
many public statements stressing alliance solidarity and announcing its
actions. Participants learned in this game, however, that countering
disinformation with truth isn't necessarily effective. While national
capitals and international organizations such as NATO had an
understanding of such challenges, based on considerable firsthand
experience, most have failed to develop tools to cope with these types
of challenges. Addressing the disinformation challenge will require new
partnerships with the private sector, agile systems that allow countries
to respond rapidly, and more advanced digital operations.

The Iceland scenario in Move 2 offered another important lesson: the
geostrategic value of this small country. NATO's longstanding and heated
debates on burden-sharing tend to equate an ally's value with the
percentage of GDP it spends on defense. NATO members should of course
deliver on their pledges from the 2014 Wales Summit to spend more on
defense, but the indispensable nature of a country such as Iceland
cannot be fully evaluated by measuring its defense spending.5 Iceland's
unique geographic position highlights the strategic importance of
location and access within the broader debate. Although Iceland spends
nothing on military forces---because it does not have them---the
exercise highlighted the underlying hard truth that **[no plan can
adequately defend alliance interests]{.underline}** in the Atlantic
**[if it does not include access to Iceland.]{.underline}**

As participants grappled with the news from Iceland, they also had to
address the fact that an undersea cable between Iceland and Canada had
been cut. This part of the exercise provided interesting lessons about
intelligence sharing. The U.S. team had evidence that the Russians were
responsible for the cut in the cable, but in seeking agreement among the
allies to reproach the Russians about this incident and to warn against
any more such actions, they met some resistance. Some of the allies
expressed a lack of trust in U.S. intelligence and asked if any of the
other allies might serve as independent verifiers. Only after more than
one source could confirm that the Russian government was responsible did
the allies agree to proceed with the demarche.

**[Forgotten Waters highlighted]{.underline}** other **[disparities
among NATO states]{.underline}** that **[impeded action.]{.underline}**
First, allies varied in the degree to which they viewed the GIUK Gap as
an area of strategic importance. Second, some NA**[TO members considered
strategic deterrence assets to be a much greater concern than the
anti-submarine threat]{.underline}**, a variation reflected in the
allies' respective defense investments.

**[Even where allies have invested in ASW capabilities]{.underline}**
that are well suited to address the challenges NATO faces in the GIUK
Gap, **[not all those assets are deployed]{.underline}** in or near the
North Atlantic. U.S. P-8s and Triton Unmanned Aircraft Systems, for
example, are forward-deployed to Asia; the challenges associated with
"pivoting" those assets to the North Atlantic in a crisis were on full
display during Forgotten Waters.

The exercise also highlighted an array of allied views on the utility of
relying on the NATO-Russia Council (NRC) during a crisis. During Move 1,
the Russia team proposed a NATO-Russia Council meeting to discuss the
collision between a Russian submarine and an Italian vessel
participating in a NATO exercise. NATO debated this idea for some time
and, while most allies supported the idea of a meeting, some suggested
that NATO should make the meeting conditional on Russia leaving the
area. In making the NRC meeting conditional, however, NATO had to accept
that it might not happen at all: if Russia simply declined NATO's
request, the alliance would be without any open channel to help ease
tensions.

Perhaps the **[biggest impediment to action]{.underline}** during the
exercise **[was the NATO decision-making process]{.underline}**, which
was disinclined towards rapid action. This phenomenon was not an
artifact of the game; all participants attested that it reflected the
reality in NATO consultations. Here, blame is shared by all sides.
Inside NATO, SACEUR and other leaders lacked pre-formed plans or
coordination processes that would facilitate a decisive response to an
urgent situation. Considerable confusion over NATO's rules of engagement
produced yet more indecision. Some NATO allies, putting more emphasis on
their own domestic security needs, showed a preference for unilateral
action rather than helping develop a coordinated NATO response.

Alliance Capability Challenges

The challenges of the alliance's administrative and procedural processes
pale in comparison to the difficulties that will confront NATO after it
decides to act. Neither the individual member states, nor the alliance
as a whole, presently possess the ability to conduct a comprehensive and
coordinated anti-submarine warfare campaign under either peacetime or
wartime conditions. The Atlantic-facing members of NATO now possess far
fewer frigates---the premier class of surface vessels designated to
conduct ASW operations---than they did 20 years ago. Where they
collectively had around 100 frigates in 1995, that number hovers at 51
today. Similarly, these nations had, in 1995, 145 attack
submarines---those dedicated to anti-shipping and anti-submarine warfare
missions---but that number has plummeted to a present low of 84.
Moreover, most of the 52 U.S. attack submarines are presently being
"pivoted" to the rising threat in the Asian Pacific region.6 In
addition, the United States has placed its large underwater Sound
Surveillance System (SOSUS) in a standby condition, where data remains
available but is unmonitored, while the U.S. Navy's Surveillance
Towed-Array Sensor System (SURTASS) fleet is being cut from nine to five
ships. As a result, NATO's ability to monitor and track threats in the
underwater environment has been badly degraded, just as a revanchist
Russia is re-emerging to challenge NATO interests in the Atlantic Ocean
and the Mediterranean Sea.7

After the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Russia's
Navy struggled for a time to define its strategic role. In July 2015,
however, President Putin enunciated a new Maritime Doctrine for Russia
that defined the Arctic, Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans and the
Caspian Sea as geostrategic theaters. This new Maritime Doctrine
specified the Atlantic Ocean, in particular, as an arena for potential
conflict with the United States and NATO: "The national maritime policy
on the Atlantic regional direction is determined by the growing
economic, political and military pressure of NATO bloc countries ...
\[which are\] drastically reducing the capabilities of the Russian
Federation to implement its maritime activities."8 In other words, "we
are coming out into the Atlantic because you have threatened us along
our western border in Central Europe." If this strategy is carried out,
in all likelihood it will be Russia's submarine force---led by the
Sierra II, Victor III, and Akula-class submarines that were newly
commissioned or under construction as the USSR collapsed---that will
represent the vanguard of Russia's strategic assertiveness. These highly
effective older boats will be supplemented by new fast attack
submarines, the Yasen class, which first entered service in 2014. Armed
with land attack cruise missiles, anti-ship cruise missiles, and
anti-ship and anti-submarine torpedoes, the Yasen class brings a new
level of lethality to the undersea environment. It is also rumored to be
quieter than its predecessors, although not as quiet as American Seawolf
and Virginia-class submarines.9 Russia has been persistently testing the
NATO alliance in the Baltic Sea for years. Late in 2016, several news
sources reported that multiple Russian submarines had transited through
the North Atlantic and entered the Mediterranean Sea in support of a
Russian carrier strike group that was operating off Syria.10 Russian
submarines have appeared off the east coast of the United States as
well.11

The Forgotten Waters tabletop exercise made it clear that **[the
alliance is nowhere near ready to respond quickly to undersea
challenges]{.underline}**. The **[size of NATO's anti-submarine force is
smaller]{.underline}**, **[and]{.underline}** it is **[decidedly less
ready to conduct operations]{.underline}**; at least one knowledgeable
participant suggested that **[no less than 50 days would be required to
assemble a ready ASW force.]{.underline}** Some
**[nations]{.underline}** that **[possess new high-technology
capabilities are reluctant to share these across the
alliance]{.underline}** due to commercial and proprietary concerns.
Participants recognized **[that if even a group of multinational
alliance ships could be assembled]{.underline}** in a high material
condition of readiness, **[they would have had little to no ASW
training]{.underline}** together as a team in recent decades. The
**[effectiveness]{.underline}** of such a **[force under competitive
conditions of real-time ASW operations]{.underline}** **[would be
questionable.]{.underline}** Former Supreme Allied Commander General
Philip Breedlove, USAF (Ret), stated that the alliance lacks experience
in basic command and control. "NATO couldn't pull off Libya today," he
said, in an allusion to the alliance's 2011 Odyssey Dawn campaign, and
it could not execute high-end maritime combat, let alone a theater-wide
ASW campaign. It became clear from the Forgotten Waters exercise that
additional and persistent NATO ASW exercises are needed to rebuild
long-atrophied skills.

**[Deficits in]{.underline}** capabilities and
**[capacities]{.underline}**, in qualities and quantities, are
**[occurring as the undersea environment]{.underline}** is **[rapidly
gaining strategic importance]{.underline}**. In the past, the oceans
were viewed as a contested commons across which key supplies and troops
would flow to war. Today, in addition, **[key economic infrastructure
are undersea]{.underline}**, including communications cables and energy
wellheads and pipelines. **[Ninety-nine percent of all transoceanic
communications flow through undersea cables]{.underline}**; nearly one
third of all oil global and natural gas production is drawn from
undersea wells.12 **[These are persistently under threat.]{.underline}**
Forgotten Waters revealed both how crucial these investments are to the
daily lives of alliance members and the paucity of thought that has been
devoted to their defense. Assumptions that care and maintenance of
undersea assets are the responsibility of the commercial sector break
down during wartime conditions, when the presence of enemy combatants
can prevent commercial ships from making the repairs necessary to
maintain communications and energy flows. In a global economy that is
increasingly dependent upon access to the undersea environment, **[the
NATO alliance must adapt rapidly to these new conditions.]{.underline}**

Forward

**[Geography still rules]{.underline}**, **[despite]{.underline}** the
**[conceits of the]{.underline}** jet age and the **[information
age]{.underline}**. **[Geography is where any discussion of the
strategic environment must begin]{.underline}**. To know a country's
geography provides clues to its intentions better than any wiretap of
its national security meetings. The geography that concerned us in the
"Forgotten Waters" exercise described in this paper is the North
Atlantic passage between Greenland and Iceland to the west and the
United Kingdom to the east: the GIUK Gap, as it was known throughout the
Cold War. **[The key here is precisely the geography that]{.underline}**
**[cannot be seen from above]{.underline}**: **[the]{.underline}**
**[underwater domain]{.underline}** where the slope and composition of
the bottom, as well as nearly isothermal temperatures, **[make for ideal
sound propagation]{.underline}**. This geography is **[further
complicated by pipelines, communications cables, and economic exclusion
zones]{.underline}**. Indeed, **[below the surface of a boisterous ocean
is a critical strategic world]{.underline}**.

The **[GIUK Gap forms]{.underline}** the **[principal choke point
between Russia's great Northern Fleet]{.underline}** **[and
its]{.underline}** **[strategic interests in the North
Atlantic]{.underline}** and all points south. The
**[Russians]{.underline}**, as a resurgent power, **[have modernized
their military forces]{.underline}**, but they still face the same
geographical limitations as in the past. **[For a Russian warship to get
from]{.underline}** icy **[northern waters to the eastern
Mediterranean]{.underline}**, it **[must pass through the GIUK
Gap]{.underline}**. **[If American warships are sent with large numbers
of troops and materiel to reinforce Europe]{.underline}**, **[they must
cross Atlantic waters infested with Russian submarines]{.underline}**,
surface vessels, or aircraft that transited south through the gap. It is
here that the geographies of North America and Europe meet and
intermesh.

**[Because]{.underline}** the GIUK **[Gap made for a perfect strategic
gateway d]{.underline}**uring the Cold War, the **[West invested heavily
in capabilities there to keep the gate shu]{.underline}**t. Almost three
decades since the Berlin Wall fell, **[the Gap is returning to its Cold
War importance]{.underline}**, **[but it is]{.underline}** yet
underappreciated by contemporary policymakers. **[NATO]{.underline}**
**[faces threats from all directions,]{.underline}** so how can the
Alliance also pay attention to the North Atlantic? How can it rebuild
military capabilities and skillsets for this region when resources are
constrained? Should the NATO members in the region adopt a defensive
posture and protect convoys, or should they adopt an offensive posture
and venture out to hunt subs, or perhaps both? Such questions, pondered
by World War II naval planners, are once again relevant.

The Forgotten Waters tabletop exercise concentrated on what is hidden
from view, but is critical nevertheless. And something new and even
larger informed this exercise: the vast increase in container shipping
over the decades, underwater cables for electronic communications, and
the growth of the American, Chinese, Indian, and other navies have made
the seas as important as the dry land. They can no longer be relegated
to the outer boundaries of strategic thinking. Newly pertinent is the
celebrated 1904 essay by British geographer Sir Halford J. Mackinder,
"The Geographical Pivot of History," that shook the foundations of
strategic theory. It declared that the Central Asian heartland of
Eurasia had become the key battleground, as European power struggles had
grown to encompass the entire Eastern Hemisphere. This spatial way of
thinking would now, however, place increased importance on the seas.
Mackinder's theory would now conclude that, rather than the Central
Asian hub on dry land, it is the rim of the imaginary wheel that
revolves around that hub that has attained strategic dominance. Along
that rim are the seas: the East China Sea, the South China Sea, the
Indian Ocean, the Mediterranean via the Suez Canal, and the GIUK Gap.
And so this paper is concerned with a puzzle-piece of the earth that,
rather than obscure and marginal, is critical to NATO's strategic
thinking and its future.

Introduction

**[Russia's]{.underline}** **[aggressive actions]{.underline}** in
recent years have **[reminded us of the importance of transatlantic
resolve and]{.underline}** of **[maintaining strong
deterrence]{.underline}**. **[In the quarter-century since the end of
the Cold Wa]{.underline}**r, and particularly during the most recent
tenure of President Vladimir Putin, **[Russia has
changed]{.underline}**; once a reluctant but pragmatic partner, it is an
**[increasingly aggressive actor]{.underline}** as **[in]{.underline}**
earlier **[strategic eras]{.underline}**. Its **[military]{.underline}**
has **[begun to transition]{.underline}**, too: in a state of disrepair
after the collapse of the Soviet Union, it is now a steadily
**[modernizing force with significant capabilities
f]{.underline}**ocused on **[traditional and asymmetric
missions]{.underline}**. Russia has paired its military capabilities
with an **[array of gray zone tactics]{.underline}** involving proxies,
subterfuge, and **[disinformation designed to intimidate neighbors and
sow divisions]{.underline}** among the transatlantic partners. The
current reality of Russian power and ambition necessitates a renewed
examination of Russian strategy across traditional and emerging domains.

The maritime domain, in particular, is once again garnering increased
attention among NATO allies, especially as **[Russian
submarines]{.underline}** **[have become more capable]{.underline}**,
**[while]{.underline}** Allied anti-submarine warfare (**[ASW)
capabilities have atrophied]{.underline}** over time. **[Defense
experts]{.underline}** now **[caution]{.underline}** that the "**[GIUK
Gap"---]{.underline}**a line stretching between Greenland and Iceland to
the United Kingdom---**[is a]{.underline}** potential
**[flashpoint]{.underline}** **[between NATO and Russia]{.underline}**,
whose Murmansk-based Northern Fleet must transit the Gap to reach the
Atlantic.1 So that **[Russia's maritime assets might]{.underline}**
**[project force and support its interests]{.underline}**,
**[Putin]{.underline}** revamped Russia's national security strategy in
2016 to **[stress]{.underline}** **[unfettered maritime
access]{.underline}** to the Atlantic. This **[partially explains why
the GIUK Gap has seen more submarine traffic]{.underline}**
**[and]{.underline}** **[higher tensions i]{.underline}**n recent
years.2 Although **[Russia]{.underline}** recently announced cuts to its
defense spending, the authors believe that it **[will continue to devote
resources to advanced nuclear submarines]{.underline}** and other
platforms **[that promise asymmetric advantages]{.underline}**.3
**[Russian submarine patrols]{.underline}** in the area **[hit recently
a post--Cold War high;]{.underline}** low-level, high-speed Russian
aircraft flybys of U.S. naval warships have increased. As a result,
**[focus on Allied maritime capabilities that could deter these actions
has heightened.]{.underline}**

//um-ef)

Finally, improved **[MDA can support other policies]{.underline}**.
**[For example, sanctions against North Korea]{.underline}** **[have
been circumvented by Chinese and Russian provision of at-sea transfers
of oil to North Korean vessels]{.underline}**. As of September 2018,
some 148 transfers had provided North Korea with perhaps a million
barrels of illicit petrol, oil, and lubricants (POL).6 **[Many of these
transfers occur on the high seas]{.underline}**, outside any nation's
EEZ, **[and are therefore much harder to detect and
monitor]{.underline}**. For a country to have a fairly complete MDA, it
must collect the maximum amount of information about any ship or vessel
within national waters, as well as its own EEZ. A country must also be
aware of threats that might arise from international waters. Despite the
investment of substantial resources by some countries, including the
various members of the Quad as well as South Korea, Singapore, and the
PRC, most countries' ability to maintain MDA remains, at best,
incomplete. This fact was highlighted in the search for the lost
Malaysian passenger flight MH370. Despite air traffic control's radar
tracking the aircraft's initial flights and subsequent satellite updates
(from the aircraft's systems), it disappeared from regional air traffic
and air defense radars. A subsequent three-year search, involving 26
nations, 60 ships, and 50 aircraft, has not resolved the fate of the
hapless airliner.7 Seow Bei Yi, "MH370: Straits Times Web Special
Highlights Sea and Air Assets Used in Hunt," The Straits Times

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/mh370-straits-times-web-special-highlights-sea-and-air-assets-used-in-hunt
(accessed January 9, 2019). There is neither a single maritime
monitoring authority, nor complete, 24/7, all-weather coverage of the
world's waterways and open ocean. Even where regions are under
observation, states may not share that data for reasons of national
security. This is even more problematic due to the general decline in
the number of available naval and maritime law enforcement platforms.
The U.S. Navy, for example, is currently operating with fewer than 300
ships, set against a 355-ship requirement for global operations. The
U.S. Coast Guard has 243 vessels that are more than 65 feet in length,
but most of these are service vessels, such as buoy tenders and smaller
patrol craft. The total number of National Security Cutters, High
Endurance Cutters, and Medium Endurance Cutters available to patrol
American EEZs (which include not only the East and West Coasts, but the
waters around Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, and Puerto Rico) is only 37.8 U.S.

(accessed January 9, 2019). **[The challenge associated with MDA is only
partly one of data collection]{.underline}**. **[Thanks to the
proliferation of ship-tracking technologies and surveillance systems and
methods, there is a growing amount of available maritime
information]{.underline}**. But **[that information can only be useful
once it is analyzed]{.underline}**. **[Consequently, improved MDA
requires not only more and better coverage of the world's
oceans]{.underline}** (and associated activity above and below the
surface), **[but also more analytical capacity]{.underline}**.

**[[AI]{.mark} and unmanned systems [aid]{.mark} underwater [stealth
missions.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

While **[[submarines]{.mark} are [vital to undersea warfare,
success]{.mark} in the domain [requires]{.mark} the [integration
of]{.mark} a much broader array of systems and technologies, including
[artificial intelligence]{.mark} and unmanned systems.]{.underline}**

**[Undersea warfare is a lot more than just submarine versus
submarine]{.underline}**. My job is to make sure our undersea forces-and
that includes our ballistic missile submarines, our attack submarines,
our carrier strike group ASW \[anti-submarine warfare\] forces, maritime
patrol aircraft, fixed systems, unmanned and autonomous systems, all of
that-are able to integrate as part of an undersea battle force, explains
Rear Adm. Richard Seif, USN, commander, Undersea Warfighting Development
Center (UWDC), Groton, Connecticut.

**[The UWDC mission is to support undersea superiority]{.underline}**,
in part by integrating a wide array of technologies and developing
doctrine for multidomain undersea warfare. Priorities include
cross-domain tactical development and capability development; wargaming;
in-depth analysis of real-world operations; rapid integration of new
weapons, sensors and new technologies such as artificial intelligence
(AI) and machine learning (ML); and direct support of deployed undersea
forces. Based in Groton, the UWDC also has detachments in Norfolk,
Virginia, and San Diego and includes an Arctic Submarine Lab and a
Tactical Analysis Group.

We have to integrate across domains. When I say across domains, I mean
space and cyber all the way to the seafloor and then integrate all of
that combat power as part of a broader joint force

**[[Communications and]{.mark} a [common operating]{.mark} picture are
[integral to]{.mark} the joint-domain
[operations]{.mark}]{.underline}**, but **[both are a particular
challenge undersea]{.underline}**. When were talking about integrating
with the joint force and integrating across domains, what we\'re really
talking about is the ability to share a common operating picture and
communicate without giving up our stealth, communicate using a variety
of systems. My command, **[[UWDC]{.mark}, is working really hard
[integrating]{.mark} and [developing new tech]{.mark}nology and
experimenting with it and making sure we\'re ready to communicate across
domains with both manned and unmanned platforms]{.underline}**,\" Adm.
Seif notes.

Having served aboard five nuclear fast attack submarines, including as a
commanding officer on the USS Buffalo (SSN 715) and USS Jacksonville
(SSN 699), Adm. Seif does not discount the critical role of submarines.
\"Within the submarine force, as part of the undersea domain, our
nuclear attack submarine force does take up a fair amount of my
priorities. I think of our attack submarines as our country\'s apex
predators ready to appear at the time of our choosing and deliver just
overwhelming combat power,\" he says.

**[[Submarines]{.mark} remain [vital]{.mark} in part [because of]{.mark}
their [stealth and versatility.]{.mark}]{.underline}** \"We expect our
submarine force, as a stealth force and endurance capability, **[to
operate inside an adversary\'s defensive perimeters and [deliver]{.mark}
all kinds of effects-precision strike, [anti-surface]{.mark} weapons,
[anti-sub]{.mark}marine weapons, [seabed warfare, mining]{.mark},
delivery of [SEAL]{.mark} \[sea, air and land\] teams and really every
kind of effect you can think of\" he adds.]{.underline}** \"But what
really makes us most effective is when our undersea forces are able to
integrate with other stealth forces and share targeting, communicate and
ultimately provide access as part of the broader joint force\"

The Navy currently is building Columbia-class submarines to replace
Ohio-class ballistic missile subs. They are considered the Navy\'s
number one acquisition priority and will be the \"largest, most capable
and most advanced submarines\" according to a Navy fact sheet.

The service also is building the Block V Virginia-class submarine, a
nuclear-powered fast attack vessel that incorporates stealth
technologies and intelligence gathering capabilities and will carry more
Tomahawk cruise missiles than its predecessors. \"The ability to put a
variety of weapon systems and payloads into the Block V Virginia class
is just really gamechanging for the undersea enterprise. As new weapon
systems and new long-range weapons and different capabilities come
online, my team\'s job is to make sure the crews are ready to work with

### 1AC/2AC \-\-- New Russia Capabilities

#### Russia has new submarines with AI capabilities\-\--they are *[ginormous]{.underline}*

**Tiwari 22 ---** Sakshi Tiwari, \"World's 2 Largest Submarines,\"
Latest Asian, Middle-East, EurAsian, Indian News, 6-27-2022,
https://eurasiantimes.com/worlds-2-largest-submarines-russian-navys-belgorod-dmitri-donskoi/,
accessed 6-30-2022, WMK

Meanwhile, a **[significant development concerning Russia's largest
submarines has been observed in the White Sea]{.underline}** --- several
miles away from the theatre of war and close to Russia's northwestern
coast.

On June 26, Naval Analyst HI Sutton citing Open Source Intelligence
revealed that **[the two largest submarines in the world]{.underline}**-
the Belgorod (K-239) and the Dmitriy Donskoi (TK-208) of the Typhoon
Class **[were caught on the surface of the White Sea.]{.underline}**

He further claimed that **[these subs are ginormous, much bigger
than]{.underline}** **[anything in the West]{.underline}**, **[even the
US Navy's Ohio Class which is US Navy's prized possession and a
nuclear-powered submarine in the American fleet.]{.underline}** However,
it was not immediately clear why the two submarines appeared suddenly in
the White Sea.

The White Sea is a southern inlet of the Barents Sea on Russia's
northwest coast. It is pertinent to note that the White Sea serves as a
vital conduit between Russia's Far Eastern ports and the economically
vibrant regions of northwest Russia and other nations.

The White Sea-Baltic Canal, which flows into Lake Onega, connects it to
the waterway network of European Russia.

Although the exact purpose of the two submarines floating in the White
Sea is unknown, there are speculations that the Dmitry Donskoi was
assisting the sea trials of a submarine --- potentially the Belgorod.
EurAsian Times could not independently verify this information.

"**[White Sea is Russia's backyard, close to Finland and
Sweden]{.underline}**. It is possible that the two submarines were
headed to the Barents Sea via the White Sea-Baltic Canal for some
routine operation. Since the canal is not too deep, the **[submarines
might have had to surface and transit"]{.underline}**, according to
military analyst Joseph P Chacko.

When **[asked whether the submarines had anything to do with soon-to-be
NATO members Finland and Sweden]{.underline}**, Chacko said, **["These
are strategic submarines that only use long-range ballistic
missiles]{.underline}**. To guard against the Nordics, the Iskander
missile would suffice. So, I think it was just Russia guarding its
perimeter against the US or undertaking a routine exercise."

The Dmitry Donskoi was reportedly first sighted in the White Sea last
week, on June 17 or 18. However, the appearance of the Belgorod-class
evokes interest as the mammoth submarine is still on trial, according to
Sutton.

**[Ginormous Russian Submarine In The White Sea]{.underline}**

The Project 941 Akula class RFS Dmitri Donskoy (TK-208) **[nuclear
ballistic missile submarine]{.underline}** is part of the Russian Navy
and goes by the NATO reporting name Typhoon.

The submarine, which is 175 meters long --- nearly 600 feet --- has been
operational since 1980 and has undergone substantial upgrades throughout
its existence. The ship has a crew of about 160 people and has a
displacement of 48,000 tons.

The **[submarine can unleash a]{.underline}** **[wave of missiles at
targeted ships and cause significant damage]{.underline}** when
unchallenged, thanks to its powerful missile artillery. These submarines
can also relatively covertly launch massive ballistic missiles from
anywhere in the world.

Even though it is the last serving submarine of its class, with all
other sister ships decommissioned over the years, Russian state news
agency TASS reported that the Dmitry Donskoi would remain in service for
the next five years at least. It was the biggest submarine in the world
until the Belgorod, also sighted in the White Sea.

The Belgorod is a sizable, stealthy, specially designed nuclear vessel
that was constructed from the unfinished hull of an Oscar-II cruise
missile submarine. Everything from underwater drones like the
Klavesin-2R to Losharik miniature submarines is believed to be
compatible.

The ship's hull was extended to a length of around 184 meters (604
feet), and its displacement was increased to 30,000 tons (when
submerged), which was less than half that of the Ohio-class ballistic
missile submarines used by the US Navy.

According to an article by HI Sutton, Belgorod will be manned by Russian
sailors but run by the covert Main Directorate Deep-Sea Research company
GUGI.

He also stated that although **[the submarine]{.underline}** **[has
undergone considerable renovations and may even have some of the newest
technology,]{.underline}** she is still an earlier generation of the
submarine and is probably less stealthy than the most recent generations
of submarines.

It was earlier revealed that the **[artificial intelligence-guided
nuclear-tipped Poseidon torpedoes will be integrated into the 14,700-ton
submarine]{.underline}**.

EurAsian Times had earlier **[reported that it would most likely be used
in the Pacific fleet, w]{.underline}**hich **[might endanger US naval
bases on the West Coast and significant cities like Los
Angeles]{.underline}**. Additionally, its **[underground construction
and inexhaustible nuclear power]{.underline}** **[could move undetected
to any region.]{.underline}**

**["Many assessments of]{.underline}** what **[the Russian
military]{.underline}** can and cannot do **[have been
inaccurate]{.underline}**. **[This isn't just problematic for the facts'
sake]{.underline}** -- more troubling, **[it risks skewing our

**[When]{.underline}** **[Western analysts]{.underline}** -- and in
turn, Western **[leaders -- seek to discredit Russian military
capabilities, Moscow will likely continue to take the opportunity to
prove them wrong."]{.underline}**

Since non-NATO submarine deployments nearly ceased in the mid-1990s,
**[NATO]{.underline}** now **[has a generation of]{.underline}**
officers and civilian **[leaders who did not grow up experiencing the
"cat and mouse" environment of submarine warfare which existed during
the Cold War]{.underline}**. **[NATO]{.underline}** has conducted three
major **[joint operations]{.underline}** during **[since the end of the
Cold Wa]{.underline}**r. **[None]{.underline}** of these operations
**[were conducted in an area challenged by the presence of an adversary
submarine]{.underline}**. Just as air chiefs fight the perception NATO
will always have air superiority in any campaign, **[maritime leaders
must]{.underline}** also **[engage to challenge the perception that
NATO's maritime forces will always have maritime
superiority]{.underline}**. **[This perception]{.underline}**,
**[coupled with]{.underline}** **[inaccurate beliefs regarding the
capability of the Russian Federation's maritime
capability]{.underline}**, **[has coloured maritime defence spending for
decades]{.underline}**. As a result, **[NATO has ceded]{.underline}**
much of **[the advantage it earned at the conclusion of the Cold
War]{.underline}**. Therefore, to dispute this prevailing theory, this
study is intended to be read by a much broader audience than purely the
maritime component.

**[Unlocated submarines present numerous problems for]{.underline}**
both the Maritime component and for **[NATO writ large]{.underline}**.
**[An adversary submarine which is not tracked]{.underline}** from a
theatre level will have freedom of movement to **[pose numerous threats
to NATO forces and territories]{.underline}**. **[A single submarine
can]{.underline}** effectively **[close a maritime choke
point]{.underline}**, such as the Strait of Gibraltar, preventing
merchant traffic or naval forces from transiting.  An unlocated
submarine can **[lie in wait for a naval task force and effectively pick
off the high value]{.underline}** capital **[ships]{.underline}**,
**[removing in a single blow]{.underline}** a significant part of the
joint **[capability to project power]{.underline}** **[(aircraft
carrier, amphibious assault ship) or]{.underline}** resupply naval
forces at sea Adversary attack submarines (SSN) are charged with
detecting and potentially engaging not only NATO surface ships, but
NATO's **[ballistic]{.underline}** missile submarines serving as the
seaborne aspect of the **[nuclear deterrent]{.underline}**. **[If those
submarines are not tracked]{.underline}** at a theatre level, **[it puts
the nuclear deterrent force at risk.]{.underline}** Furthermore, **[an
unlocated submarine could establish a covert operating area close to a
NATO nation's coastline]{.underline}**. From there, it **[can project
striking power deep into NATO]{.underline}**, exploiting recent
advancements in modern cruise missile capability (some with ranges in
excess of 1500km) and ballistic missile capability. All of these
situations become significantly mitigated by tracking submarines
throughout their deployment at a theatre level. **[NATO]{.underline}**
excelled at tracking submarines in the Cold War, but the **[skills have
atrophied]{.underline}** and the resources have dwindled.

**[After]{.underline}** Russia's 2014 **[attack on
Ukraine]{.underline}**, the **[US \"saw an uptick of Russian navy
submarine out-of-area deployers,]{.underline}** which culminated in
Russian general-purpose submarines\" **[operating off of the US East
Coast]{.underline}**, Vice Adm. Daniel Dwyer, commander of the US Navy's
2nd Fleet, said at the WEST Conference in San Diego in February.

\"It was determined at that point that the **[Atlantic]{.underline}**
**[no longer provided that geography that enabled our
protection]{.underline}** **[and that standoff
\[distance\]]{.underline}** that we've enjoyed for so many decades,\"
added Dwyer, whose command was reactivated in 2018 in response to that
undersea activity.

Russian **[submarines]{.underline}** have **[also added the ability to
attack land targets with cruise missiles,]{.underline}** which they
demonstrated for the first time with strikes on ISIS targets in Syria in
2015, surprising US military leaders in Europe.

NATO commanders fear those **[missiles]{.underline}** **[could be used
against ports and other infrastructure in Europe]{.underline}**,
potentially **[interfering with]{.underline}** **[resupply and
reinforcement efforts.]{.underline}** Recent US and NATO drills have
focused on getting convoys across the Atlantic and to disembarkation
points in Europe.

US military leaders also see those **[missiles]{.underline}** as a
**[growing threat to the US mainland.]{.underline}** US Air Force Gen.
Glen VanHerck, who is responsible for North America as head of Northern
Command and NORAD, has repeatedly **[warned]{.underline}** about air-
and **[sea-launched cruise missiles]{.underline}**.

VanHerck has pointed specifically to **[Russia's Severodvinsk-class
guided-missile submarines]{.underline}**, calling them \"**[on par with
ours\"]{.underline}** and telling lawmakers this month that those subs,
also called the Yasen class, \"**[are designed to deploy undetected
within cruise-missile range of our coastlines to threaten critical
infrastructure during an escalating crisis]{.underline}**.\"

\"This **[challenge]{.underline}** **[will be compounded]{.underline}**
in the next few years as the Russian Navy adds the Tsirkon **[hypersonic
cruise missile]{.underline}** to the Severodvinsk's arsenal,\" VanHerck
told the House Armed Services Committee.

VanHerck has advocated **[new]{.underline}** and **[modernized detection
systems]{.underline}** **[to]{.underline}** **[spot activity in the sea
and the air around the US,]{.underline}** including updates to the
Navy's Integrated Undersea Surveillance System, which is important
\"**[as Russia and China continue to field highly advanced
guided-missile submarines]{.underline}**,\" VanHerck told lawmakers.

Russia's struggles on the ground in Ukraine have raised questions about
the quality of its military and its leadership after years of investment
and upgrades. **[Russia's navy has had a limited role in the
conflict]{.underline}** so far, and the US Navy's top **[civilian
official has cautioned against drawing conclusions about its
capabilities.]{.underline}**

\"One should **[never underestimate one's adversary,\"]{.underline}**
Navy Secretary Carlos del Toro said this month at the McAleese defense
conference. \"Perhaps the **[shortcomings that we've seen with regards
to the Russian army]{.underline}** as it invades Ukraine, the same
disadvantage **[doesn't necessarily translate over to the navy and their
submarine force.\"]{.underline}**

Moscow is **[investing]{.underline}** **[\"very strategically and
wisely\" in its submarines,]{.underline}** \"**[and their
technolog]{.underline}**y **[approaches ours,\"]{.underline}** del Toro
said, \"so one should never underestimate that capability and the threat
that that capability presents to us.\"

### 2AC \-\-- Seapower k NATO Deterrence

WMK

8\. **[The importance of the sea for the Alliance]{.underline}** **[can
hardly be overstated]{.underline}** (see also Map 1). The
**[conventional defence of Europ]{.underline}**e **[rests on two
pillars]{.underline}** (Breedlove, 2018). First, the **[Alliance must
have robust military power]{.underline}**, including Canadian and US
forces, **[present and ready in Europe,]{.underline}** **[including its
maritime approaches.]{.underline}** Second, **[the North American Allies
must]{.underline}** **[be able to reinforce and resupply the European
continent]{.underline}** with materiel and personnel in times of crisis
or war. **[International law, norms, and multinational
institutions]{.underline}** **[underpin the principle of freedom of
navigation]{.underline}** in peace time (Tamnes, 2018). However, **[in
contingency situations,]{.underline}** the **[Alliance will only be able
to guarantee such freedom if it can exercise control of the sea and
project power into and across it.]{.underline}**

9\. As its name makes abundantly clear, **[the North Atlantic
Ocean]{.underline}** **[is at the core of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization.]{.underline}** It is a **[vital part of NATO's area of
responsibility]{.underline}** and its **[most important sea line of
communication]{.underline}** (Olsen, 2018). **[It is "NATO's
lifeblood]{.underline}**", as General Philip M. Breedlove, NATO's former
Supreme Allied Commander Europe, so aptly puts it (Breedlove, 2018). In
addition to its military importance, **[it also remains the key to
economic prosperity]{.underline}** in North America and Europe **[and
hosts]{.underline}** **[critical undersea communication
cables.]{.underline}**

10\. While the North Atlantic may be the most important maritime
environment for the Alliance, **[NATO should also be in a position
to]{.underline}** **[exercise control of]{.underline}**, or guarantee
access to, its **[other maritime areas of responsibility]{.underline}**,
most importantly the Baltic, Mediterranean, and Black Seas.

11\. **[The Baltic Sea connects]{.underline}** nine European countries,
including **[six Allies.]{.underline}** **[Maritime traffic
is]{.underline}** **[extremely dense]{.underline}**. Almost 15% of
global maritime cargo traffic is related to the region (Nordenman,
2018). Moreover, the **[Baltic Sea is the third most important energy
node]{.underline}** after the Strait of Hormuz and the Strait of
Malacca. **[If Russia ever succeeded in closing]{.underline}** the
104-kilometre land border between Poland and Lithuania (**[the Suwalki
gap]{.underline}**), the **[maritime approaches in the Baltic
Sea]{.underline}** **[would also be the only viable reinforcement and
resupply route]{.underline}** for Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania.

12\. In recent decades, **[the Mediterranean Sea has
become]{.underline}** **[increasingly important]{.underline}** for the
Alliance and especially **[for the nine Allies with Mediterranean
shores]{.underline}**. **[Maritime trade between countries in the region
accounts for almost a quarter of global maritime trade]{.underline}**
(UFM, n.d.). Another **[key reason remains the continuing difficult
security environment]{.underline}** in the Maghreb and the Eastern
Mediterranean. A very visible sign of the Mediterranean Sea's rising
importance was the move of the US Sixth Fleet's headquarters from London
to Naples in the mid-2000s.

13\. **[While the Black Sea boasts far less maritime
traffic]{.underline}**, it **[still represents a highly complex
geopolitical environment]{.underline}** for NATO as a whole and for
Bulgaria, Romania, and Turkey in particular. This has been especially
true after the 2008 Russia-Georgia conflict, Russia's illegal and
illegitimate annexation of Crimea in 2014, and the ongoing aggression in
eastern Ukraine. The **[military picture remains complicated for all
sides]{.underline}**. The 1936 Montreux Convention imposes firm legal
restrictions as regards vessels of war. The scope of these restrictions
differs for littoral and non-littoral states. Non-Black Sea countries
cannot send submarines through the Turkish Straits. **[Restrictions also
apply to surface ships]{.underline}**. Limits apply to the size of ships
and fleets as well as to the duration of stay (maximum 21 days).
Moreover, **[Black Sea countries can only send submarines through the
Straits if they are joining their base in the Black Se]{.underline}**a
for the first time or if they return from maintenance or repair outside
the Black Sea. Two new submarines assigned to Russia's Black Sea Fleet
have not yet joined their home base but remain in Tartus, Syria.

14\. As new opportunities and challenges arise due to the changing
climate, **[the High North is another area deserving of close monitoring
by the Alliance]{.underline}**. Arctic oil and gas projects could still
alter the global energy market. **[New maritime sea routes connecting
the Atlantic and the Pacific could change global trade]{.underline}**.
Commercial fishing in the North Atlantic and North Pacific already
accounts for about 40% of commercial fish landings globally. Tourism is
on the rise. In short, the human footprint in the Arctic is increasing -
and, with it, state interests. Submarines are ideally adapted to operate
in the Arctic. They can thus show presence, gather valuable
intelligence, present hybrid challenges, and close off increasingly busy
Arctic chokepoints. In addition to Russia as an Arctic state, Chinese
researchers are working on making the country's submarines ice-capable
for the Arctic (Goldstein, 2019), and the United States has noted that
**[China could aspire to send its submarines]{.underline}** **[into the
Arctic in the future]{.underline}** (US DOD, 2019a).

### AT: Russia = Defensive Posture

#### Russian subs are [offensive]{.underline}

WMK

23\. The Rapporteur would agree with the latter. **[One basic problem of
Russia's strategy]{.underline}** is that **[actions Russia
would]{.underline}** (**[want to) perceive as defensive]{.underline}**
-- denying access beyond the GIUK gap to protect its nuclear arsenal --
**[should be seen as a strategic challenge]{.underline}** **[to the
Alliance]{.underline}** -- **[threatening the transatlantic
link.]{.underline}**

24\. **[Another element in Russia's naval modernisation]{.underline}**
also **[points towards an offensively oriented posture]{.underline}**:
**[the]{.underline}** new **[Kalibr-3M14 long-range precision-guided
missiles]{.underline}** which can **[target both surface vessels and
land targets]{.underline}** from as far as 1,500 to 2,500 kilometres. As
a result, **[Russian submarines not only present a threat to the
transatlantic link]{.underline}**; they can now **[also deny access to
Alliance littorals]{.underline}** **[in support of the much broader
A2/AD threat]{.underline}** (Tamnes, 2018). Kalibr missiles **[could
hold critical nodes deep in Alliance territory at risk,]{.underline}**
even when on station in the Barents and White Seas. Indeed, **[Russia
has tested launching these missiles from their home base]{.underline}**,
significantly reducing the time to launch (O'Dwyer, 2019). If the upper
estimate holds true, a submarine in the White Sea could place a Kalibr
on NATO Headquarters in Brussels and at least 13 Allied capitals (see
also Map 4). In a crisis or war, **[Russian submarines]{.underline}**
could **[target critical disembarkation ports]{.underline}** **[for
troop reinforcements and potentially even North America's eastern
seaboard]{.underline}** if they slipped undetected into the western
North Atlantic. Such **[a situation would have significant military,
political, and psychological effects]{.underline}** on member states,
**[potentially undermining]{.underline}** **[NATO's ability and will to
fulfil its core tasks]{.underline}** (Allport, 2018).

#### Yes revisionist\-\--they seek power to assert their position in the global order

Jeffrey **Edmonds 20**, Adjunct Senior Fellow, Transatlantic Security

https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02681307.2019.1731209

In addition to maintaining influence along its periphery and halting
NATO's eastward expansion, **[Russian foreign policy has long focused on
reasserting Russia's status as a great power. Russians have historically
seen their country as a great nation and its precipitous domestic
decline and global retreat in the 1990s created widespread domestic
resentment.]{.underline}** The Kremlin seeks to be treated as an equal
of the US and to ensure that Moscow's interests are taken into account
in all major international decisions. **[Re-establishing Russia's global
prestige has been an important source of Putin's domestic popularity.
Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea and to a lesser extent its
intervention in Syria, as well as Russia's expanded influence in the
Middle East and other global hotspots such as Afghanistan, North Korea
and Libya have also boosted Putin's domestic standing]{.underline}**.
However, as public dissatisfaction over Russia's economic stagnation has
grown, the popular euphoria over Ukraine and Putin's international
accomplishments has waned. Putin's public approval rating stood at 68%
in December 2019, down from a high of 87% in August 2014 in the
aftermath of Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea.2

In addition to these long-term objectives of the Russian state, Putin
has emphasised several other, related priorities that have caused
Russian foreign policy to evolve over the 20 years he has been in
power.3

First, **[Putin has placed great emphasis on countering what he views as
US and Western unilateralism. Russian foreign policy has long sought to
create a multipolar]{.underline}** − or what Russian foreign policy
circles describe as 'polycentric' − **[world where Russia serves as an
independent and unaligned pole]{.underline}**. Although Russian
officials likely understand that Moscow's ability to project positive
influence that would attract other countries into its sphere of
influence or to shape the policies of other states has declined,
**[Russia seeks to ensure that no other power can dictate terms to
Moscow. Putin also appears to view it as his personal mission to oppose
what he sees as Western hypocrisy -- namely, attempts by the West to
uphold international rules and norms when they serve Western interests,
and to circumvent those same rules when they impede Western
goals]{.underline}**. Several leaders, including Turkish President Recep
Tayyip Erdogan and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, appear to
admire and at times emulate Putin's willingness to stand up to the West.

Similarly, Putin has actively focused on countering 'colour
revolutions', or what he sees as US and Western efforts to unseat
unfriendly regimes by fomenting internal instability. Putin appears to
genuinely believe that the US and the West seek to overthrow him and
bring about regime change, and he views efforts to promote democracy --
especially US efforts -- as thinly veiled attempts to undermine his
legitimacy. Putin has long sought to counter these initiatives, and his
efforts to do so have grown in scope and intensity. Since 2014, Russia
has no longer been content to push back against democracy promotion but
has actively taken the fight to Western democracies. Because Moscow
gauges its power in relation to the US, the Kremlin views weakening
these countries as a means of enhancing its own standing.4 **[In the
NATO context, this means that the Kremlin has accelerated efforts to
exploit the fault lines within and between European states and between
the US and Europe, and to fuel doubts among vulnerable NATO members
about their Allies' commitment to collective defence.]{.underline}**5

**[Putin has also increased the emphasis on militarism and grown more
reliant on military tools to advance Russian interests. His
interventions in Georgia, Ukraine and Syria have reinforced his
confidence that military action serves as an effective means of
achieving his foreign policy objectives. Putin has seen that the use of
military force enhances Russia's bargaining position with the West, and
in particular that these types of actions are the most effective way to
gain the attention of the West]{.underline}**.6 Moreover, **[Russia has
modernised its military over the past decade, successfully creating a
highly capable force]{.underline}**.7 In this respect, **[military
instruments]{.underline}** -- including cyber weapons -- **[have become
relatively more effective than Russia's soft power or economic tools,
suggesting that the Kremlin will continue to rely on military
options.]{.underline}**

**[Putin has undertaken more active and assertive efforts to advance
Russian objectives. Moscow's increasingly assertive foreign policy is a
reflection not of the country's growing strength, but of the perception
that US and Western disarray has created an opening for Russia to
exploit]{.underline}**.8 In other words, **[Moscow assesses that the
current US-led world order is coming to an end and that rising powers
such as China and Russia should have a greater influence in world
affairs.]{.underline}** Notably, Putin has found common cause with
China's President Xi Jinping, and the two countries have deepened
cooperation across key dimensions of their relationship, including in
the political, economic and defence realms. Despite the historic
mistrust and growing power asymmetry between Russia and China, there is
potential for Moscow and Beijing to cooperate in the next 10 to 15 years
in ways that could threaten US and European interests. Russia and China
share an interest in reducing US global influence and undermining the
strength and cohesion of US−Europe relations.

**[Given the growing instability in the international system and the
longstanding challenges within the Russian Federation]{.underline}**,
such as its weak economic foundation, **[Putin appears to be calculating
that he must act now to influence the international order while he still
has the ability to do so]{.underline}**. The West's failure to mount
sufficient opposition to his moves so far, along with challenges
internal to the West -- such as Brexit, the Yellow Vest protest movement
in France and the rise of far-right populist leaders in Europe -- have
only reinforced his perception that this is a promising path to
restoring Russian influence.

With the main threat to NATO coming from Russia, there are five critical
regions near or in the North Atlantic area that require focused NATO
attention albeit for different reasons. **[NATO must focus on (1) the
Arctic, (2) the Baltic Sea, and (3) the Black Sea]{.underline}** regions
**[because they are under the direct threat of Russian
aggression]{.underline}**. NATO must focus on (4) the Balkans because
the region remains the unfinished business of Euro-Atlantic integration
and is susceptible to malign Russian influence. The social and economic
conditions in some places in the Balkans makes the region ripe for
Islamist extremism. NATO must finally focus on (5) the Middle East and
North Africa (MENA). While not part of NATO's area of responsibility in
terms of collective defense, problems originating in the MENA region
have a tendency to spill over into Europe. 1. **[NATO and the Arctic.
The Arctic,]{.underline}** commonly referred to as the High North, **[is
a strategically important region]{.underline}**. **[The possibility of
decreasing ice coverage during the summer months, and advances in
technology, mean that shipping, natural resource exploration, and
tourism will bring an increase of economic activity]{.underline}**.
Although the Arctic region has been an area of low conflict among the
Arctic powers, **[NATO should consider the implications of Russia's
recent aggressive military behavior]{.underline}**. NATO is a collective
security organization designed to defend the territorial integrity of
its members. Five NATO members (Canada, Denmark, Iceland, Norway, and
the United States) are Arctic countries, and each has territory above
the Arctic Circle. In addition, **[two closely allied
nations]{.underline}** (**[Finland and Sweden) also have Arctic
territory.]{.underline}** NATO has no agreed common position on its role
in the Arctic region. No NATO Summit Declaration even mentions the word
Arctic, and neither does the Alliance's 2010 Strategic Concept. **[NATO
has been internally divided on the role that the Alliance should play in
the High North]{.underline}**. Norway is the leading voice inside the
Alliance for promoting NATO's role in the Arctic. It is the only country
in the world that has its permanent military headquarters above the
Arctic Circle, and it has invested extensively in Arctic defense
capabilities. Canada has likewise invested heavily in Arctic defense
capabilities. However, unlike Norway, Canada has stymied past efforts by
NATO to play a larger role in the region. Generally speaking, there is a
concern in Canada that an Alliance role in the Arctic would afford
non-Arctic NATO countries influence in an area where they otherwise
would have none. As a sovereign nation-state, Canada has a prerogative
to determine which role, if any, NATO should play in Canada's Arctic
region. However, as a collective-security alliance, NATO cannot ignore
the Arctic altogether, and the Alliance should not remain divided on the
issue. **[Russia has a long history in the Arctic]{.underline}**. In the
early 18th century, Russia sent a number of large expeditions to explore
and map the Siberian coastline at crippling cost to the treasury. The
explorers, scientists, and adventurers who partook in the Kamchatka
expeditions, known as the Great Northern Expeditions, numbered in the
thousands. Even by today's standards, these are still probably the
largest scientific expeditions in history. **[Almost 300 years later,
Russia is still staking new claims in the Arctic]{.underline}**. In
2007, Artur Chilingarov, then a member of the Russian Duma, led a
submarine expedition to the North Pole and planted a Russian flag on the
seabed. Later he declared: "The Arctic is Russian."88 Paul Reynolds,
"Russia Ahead in Arctic 'Gold Rush,'" BBC News, August 1, 2007,
http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/6925853.stm (accessed October 1,
2019). Today, **[Russia is motivated to play an active role in the
Arctic region]{.underline}** for three reasons: **[Low-risk promotion of
Russian nationalism]{.underline}**. **[Because nationalism is on the
rise in Russia]{.underline}**, President Vladimir **[Putin's Arctic
strategy is popular among the population]{.underline}**. For Putin,
**[the Arctic is an area that allows Russia to flex its muscles without
incurring any significant geopolitical risk]{.underline}**. **[The
economic potential of the region]{.underline}**. Russia is also eager to
promote its economic interests in the region. Half of the world's Arctic
territory and half of the Arctic region's population is located in
Russia. It is well known that **[the Arctic is home to large stockpiles
of proven, yet unexploited, oil and gas reserves]{.underline}**. The
majority of these reserves is thought to be located in Russia. In
particular, **[Russia hopes that the Northern Sea Route (NSR) will
become one of the world's most important shipping lanes]{.underline}**.
Russia's security in the region. **[Russia has invested heavily in
militarizing its Arctic region]{.underline}**. While the Arctic region
remains peaceful, Russia's recent steps to militarize the region,
coupled with its bellicose behavior toward its neighbors, makes the
Arctic a security concern. It is worth closely examining Russia's recent
steps to militarize its presence in the Arctic region. In March 2017, a
decree signed by Putin gave the Federal Security Service (FSB), which
controls law enforcement along the NSR, additional powers to confiscate
land "in areas with special objects for land use, and in the border
areas."89 Russia's Arctic territory is within this FSB-controlled border
zone. The FSB and its subordinate coast guard have added patrol vessels
and built up Arctic bases, including a new coast guard base in Murmansk
that opened in December 2018.90 is also taking on an increased role in
the Arctic and is now charged with protecting infrastructure sites that
are deemed to be of strategic importance, including a new liquefied
natural gas (LNG) export terminal at Sabetta that opened in December
2017.92 Atle Staalesen, "National Guard Becomes Arctic Protector," The

factors heavily into Russia's basing, procurement, and military
structuring]{.underline}**. As a recent report summarized: **[Russia's
military leadership accords absolute priority to perimeter defence of
the Kola Peninsula, to ensure the survivability of second-strike nuclear
assets]{.underline}**. The Kola Peninsula and its surrounding areas are
considered of strategic importance for Russian national security.
Perimeter defence around Kola and the extension of the "Bastion" defence
concept are designed to give Russia defence in depth.96 Mathieu

The two Connecticut Democrats spoke Jan. 24 at a virtual event hosted by
submarine builder General Dynamics Electric Boat.

Russian President Vladimir **[[Putin]{.underline}]{.mark}** "**[will
test us in every single place that he can.]{.underline}** He's doing it
right now in Ukraine: **[he [wants to restore]{.mark} the
[hegemony]{.mark} over countries that formerly were part of the Soviet
Union]{.underline}**; **[[bring back Ukraine]{.mark} into Mother
Russia]{.underline}**; conduct a hybrid war of military actions,
cyber-attack and misinformation. **[[And]{.underline}]{.mark}** part of
his **[overall strategy]{.underline}** is **[to bols[ter undersea
warfare]{.mark} and thereby]{.underline}** **[push the]{.underline}**
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates, **[try [to]{.mark}
divide allies]{.underline}**, **[and [create
instability]{.mark}]{.underline}**," Blumenthal said in response to a
question regarding how naval forces could help get Putin to back down in
Ukraine.

"**[[Undersea warfare]{.underline}]{.mark}** --- **[because we're
talking about the Mediterranean, about the Black Sea as potential areas
of tension and conflict]{.underline}** --- [**[is]{.underline}** **[very
much]{.underline}** **[in play]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[even though it
isn't directly involved in the confrontation]{.underline}** in the
Eastern Ukraine area or Crimea or in the northern borders of Ukraine,
which represent perhaps the greatest immediate threat in Belarus, where
Putin is amassing forces right now," he added.

The senator said he agreed with President Joe Biden's statement that
U.S. **[troops]{.underline}** **[should not]{.underline}** **[be
sent]{.underline}** into Ukraine to fight, **[but]{.underline}** he said
**[[strengthening]{.underline}]{.mark}** and bolstering **[[NATO
capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the region **[would be
[important]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[[as]{.mark} well as
[finding]{.mark}]{.underline}** other **[[ways to show
strength]{.underline}]{.mark}** "around the world **[in other areas
[where we go head-to-head with the Russians]{.mark}."]{.underline}**

He added that the U.S. should also focus on economic sanctions against
Russia, including export controls on semiconductors and other
technologies Russia needs to keep its economy going; disconnecting
Russia from the international financial system; supplying more arms to
Ukraine so the country can defend itself; and getting NATO allies,
especially Germany, united in their efforts to respond to Russia.

Though the world's focus has been on Ukraine's border with Russia to the
east and Belarus to the north, **[[Russia]{.mark} announced last week
that it would [hold]{.mark} a series of [large naval drills]{.mark} in
all its geographically dispersed fleets, [upping the ante]{.mark} in its
standoff against the West.]{.underline}**

"The drills are intended to practice navy and air force action to
protect Russian national interests in the world's
**[oceans]{.underline}** and to counter military threats to the Russian
Federation," the defense ministry said, adding that they will start this
month and run through February in the Mediterranean, North Atlantic and
Pacific.

Just the day before that announcement, the U.S. Navy announced its
guided-missile submarine Georgia was in Cyprus for a port call --- an
unusual move, announcing the location of this large submarine loaded to
the gills with conventional missiles, that in recent history has only
been done to send a message to Russia or North Korea.

Courtney, in following up to the same question at the event, said the
Harry S. Truman Carrier Strike Group exercising with NATO forces in the
Mediterranean represented "the most visible sign of presence that the
Navy is exercising out there." **[But, he said, the [submarine
fleet]{.mark} would have an [important]{.mark}, if less visible, [role
in checking Russian aggression]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

Saying that **[Russia's string of exercises would "flood the zone" with
submarines in the North Atlantic]{.underline}**, where Russia's
submarine-heavy Northern Fleet operates, Courtney said: "**[There's no
question that our [undersea fleet is going to be very busy at
thi]{.mark}s very [tense moment]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[and]{.mark}
is definitely going to play a big role [in]{.mark} terms of [making
sure]{.mark} [that]{.mark} whatever possible [conflict]{.mark} may
emerge, that it [does not escalate]{.mark} into something more
serious.]{.underline}**"

**["Many assessments of]{.underline}** what **[the Russian
military]{.underline}** can and cannot do **[have been
inaccurate]{.underline}**. **[This isn't just problematic for the facts'
sake]{.underline}** -- more troubling, **[it risks skewing our
assessment of how far Moscow will go]{.underline}**...
**[When]{.underline}** **[Western analysts]{.underline}** -- and in
turn, Western **[leaders -- seek to discredit Russian military
capabilities, Moscow will likely continue to take the opportunity to
prove them wrong."]{.underline}**

Since non-NATO submarine deployments nearly ceased in the mid-1990s,
**[NATO]{.underline}** now **[has a generation of]{.underline}**
officers and civilian **[leaders who did not grow up experiencing the
"cat and mouse" environment of submarine warfare which existed during
the Cold War]{.underline}**. **[NATO]{.underline}** has conducted three
major **[joint operations]{.underline}** during **[since the end of the
Cold Wa]{.underline}**r. **[None]{.underline}** of these operations
**[were conducted in an area challenged by the presence of an adversary
submarine]{.underline}**. Just as air chiefs fight the perception NATO
will always have air superiority in any campaign, **[maritime leaders
must]{.underline}** also **[engage to challenge the perception that
NATO's maritime forces will always have maritime
superiority]{.underline}**. **[This perception]{.underline}**,
**[coupled with]{.underline}** **[inaccurate beliefs regarding the
capability of the Russian Federation's maritime
capability]{.underline}**, **[has coloured maritime defence spending for
decades]{.underline}**. As a result, **[NATO has ceded]{.underline}**
much of **[the advantage it earned at the conclusion of the Cold
War]{.underline}**. Therefore, to dispute this prevailing theory, this
study is intended to be read by a much broader audience than purely the
maritime component.

**[Unlocated submarines present numerous problems for]{.underline}**
both the Maritime component and for **[NATO writ large]{.underline}**.
**[An adversary submarine which is not tracked]{.underline}** from a
theatre level will have freedom of movement to **[pose numerous threats
to NATO forces and territories]{.underline}**. **[A single submarine
can]{.underline}** effectively **[close a maritime choke
point]{.underline}**, such as the Strait of Gibraltar, preventing
merchant traffic or naval forces from transiting.  An unlocated
submarine can **[lie in wait for a naval task force and effectively pick
off the high value]{.underline}** capital **[ships]{.underline}**,
**[removing in a single blow]{.underline}** a significant part of the
joint **[capability to project power]{.underline}** **[(aircraft
carrier, amphibious assault ship) or]{.underline}** resupply naval
forces at sea Adversary attack submarines (SSN) are charged with
detecting and potentially engaging not only NATO surface ships, but
NATO's **[ballistic]{.underline}** missile submarines serving as the
seaborne aspect of the **[nuclear deterrent]{.underline}**. **[If those
submarines are not tracked]{.underline}** at a theatre level, **[it puts
the nuclear deterrent force at risk.]{.underline}** Furthermore, **[an
unlocated submarine could establish a covert operating area close to a
NATO nation's coastline]{.underline}**. From there, it **[can project
striking power deep into NATO]{.underline}**, exploiting recent
advancements in modern cruise missile capability (some with ranges in
excess of 1500km) and ballistic missile capability. All of these
situations become significantly mitigated by tracking submarines
throughout their deployment at a theatre level. **[NATO]{.underline}**
excelled at tracking submarines in the Cold War, but the **[skills have
atrophied]{.underline}** and the resources have dwindled.

Recommendation: **[Improve Information Sharing to Develop a Common
Undersea Operating Picture]{.underline}**

**[One of the most potent attributes of Russia\'s undersea
capabilities]{.underline}** **[is]{.underline}** the **[strategic
ambiguity created by the submarine force]{.underline}**. Many of the
**[NATO and partner nations]{.underline}** in Northern Europe **[already
possess relevant ASW capabilities]{.underline}**, **[but they are not
integrated]{.underline}** **[to produce a common undersea operating
picture.]{.underline}** **[Developing allied and partner
information-sharing capabilities will help lift the veil on Russia\'s
undersea activities and decrease its coercive power]{.underline}**. To
achieve greater integration, **[NATO should develop a
transmission-agnostic, encrypted data standard for undersea sensing
data]{.underline}**. **[Data streams from static and mobile sensors
could not only feed local assets but be relayed to a shore-based NATO
fusion center,]{.underline}** potentially colocated with the ASW COE and
aligned with the ASW-focused SNMG**[, to provide analytic
capability]{.underline}**. **[For submarine operations, this capability
should include maintaining synchronized charts of allied and partner
submarine areas of operation.]{.underline}**

Desired Effect: **[Decreases the strategic ambiguity created by Russian
undersea capabilities]{.underline}**. A common undersea operating
picture can also help **[ensure the resiliency of undersea
infrastructure to minimize underwater incidents and deconflict ASW
operations.]{.underline}**

WASHINGTON --- [The **U**nited **S**tates and its allies have been
chilling out this summer]{.underline}, but [experts and officials say
something has been missing that prevents them from making the most of
the experience.]{.underline}

A flurry of exercises, patrols and news releases has made one point
clear: **[The [[Arctic is a strategic hot
spot]{.mark}](https://www.defensenews.com/naval/2020/05/11/the-us-navy-returns-to-an-increasingly-militarized-arctic/)]{.underline}**.
Over the past few months, **[the [U.S.]{.mark} has [sent]{.mark} some of
its [highest-end]{.mark} and most sophisticated [assets]{.mark} to the
Arctic region, [including]{.mark} the highly secretive
[attack [submarine
Seawolf](https://www.navy.mil/Press-Office/News-Stories/display-news/Article/2321399/uss-seawolf-operates-in-6th-fleet/)]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
its Rota, Spain-based missile defense destroyers, and [Air Force B-2
bombers](https://www.airforcemag.com/article/flexing-in-the-arctic/).

And it has not been alone. [The United Kingdom, Canada, France, Denmark
and [others]{.mark}
have [[joined]{.mark}](https://www.navy.mil/Press-Office/News-Stories/display-news/Article/2299799/us-forces-participate-in-canadian-operation-nanook/) the
U.S. [in patrols]{.mark} and exercises in the High North, as both
[Russia and China]{.mark} have [stepped up]{.mark} their
[presence]{.mark} in the region.]{.underline}

But according to analysts, governments and a senior former military
official, **[the [Western coalition lacks]{.mark} adequate [surveillance
and intelligence]{.mark} in the region]{.underline}**.

"**[We have significant domain awareness challenges, and that really
begins in the high latitudes]{.underline}**," former U.S. Coast Guard
Commandant Adm. Paul Zukunft told a virtual audience at the 2020 Defense
News Conference, which took place Sept. 9-10. "**[Things start to get
pretty dark once you get up higher than 72 degrees
north]{.underline}**."

Among the allies, a consensus has formed that **[as China and Russia
seek to exploit the warming Arctic for new, faster shipping routes and
for resources, it's [essential]{.mark} they [invest in greater
surveillance capabilities.]{.mark}]{.underline}** To illustrate the
issue, Zukunft said the Coast Guard recently made a stunning discovery
in the Arctic --- something for which the service should have received
early warning from intelligence officials.

"**[We sent a national [security cutter]{.mark} to patrol that region in
a relatively ice-free portion of the season]{.underline}**," Zukunft
recounted. "And **[we [stumbled upon]{.mark} a [joint]{.mark} exercise
between [Russia and China]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Our intelligence
community did not have awareness that this was going on. So we were the
originators of this information and otherwise we would not have known.
**[[We need]{.mark} to continue to invest in [domain
awareness.]{.mark}"]{.underline}**

Zukunft posited that **[it should be possible to [identify high-threat
locations]{.mark} in the Arctic region [and]{.mark} send assets to
[monitor]{.mark} those areas]{.underline}**. That would be more
effective than trying to saturate the whole region with air and surface
assets, he said.

Snow blind

That's an assessment agreed to by U.S. allies such as
**[Denmark]{.underline}**. Last winter, the Danish prime minster [said
in an
interview](https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2019-12-03/danish-pm-suggests-increasing-arctic-surveillance-in-response-to-russian-activity) that
the **[increased Russian activity in the Arctic meant her country should
invest in more space-based surveillance as well as anti-submarine
capabilities.]{.underline}**

But that is **[[easier said than done]{.underline}]{.mark}**, according
to Bryan Clark, a retired U.S. Navy submarine officer and analyst with
the Hudson Institute.

"To get Arctic and Antarctic imagery, **[you have to use polar
orbits]{.underline}**," Clark explained. \"**[[Geostationary satellites
won't work]{.mark} down there: You'd get a very small area for a very
expensive satellite]{.underline}**. ... Unless you want to put in place
a dozen polar-orbiting satellites, **[you just aren't going to get the
kind of real-time imagery]{.underline}** that you get in the
mid-latitudes.

**Arctic submarine warfare is coming and [we're behind]{.underline} --
ASW barriers will be [penetrated now]{.underline} and an [offensive
posture]{.underline} is key.**

**[Key Points]{.underline}**

Despite a quantitative decline since the collapse of the Soviet Union,
there have been **[several qualitative improvements in [Russia's]{.mark}
submarine force]{.underline}** that partially offset this fact.

**[The force now has a number of missions which may not require it to
sortie far from the Arctic]{.underline}**. These include **[[conducting
precision strikes against ground targets at long ranges]{.mark} and,
potentially, [exerting sea control over the NSR]{.mark}. Simply [placing
forces in the]{.mark} Greenland-Iceland-UK ([GIUK]{.mark}) Gap [is
not]{.mark} an [adequate]{.mark} riposte to this force.]{.underline}**

**[In the models run to inform the campaign analysis in this chapter,
[both Russian and NATO sub]{.mark}marine[s]{.mark} are
[effective]{.mark} [at penetrating]{.mark} each other's [ASW
barriers]{.mark}]{.underline}**. For NATO, **[this [incentivizes]{.mark}
a [forward posture]{.mark} in a conflict with Russia.]{.underline}** On
the one hand, **[a [reactive posture emphasizing containing Russian
sub]{.mark}marine[s]{.mark} may [lead to failure]{.mark} while an
[offensive posture can exploit Russia's asymmetrical
vulnerabilities.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**[The [subsurface environment]{.mark} has a rough, but [highly
offence-dominated balance of power]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**Modernization of ASW and offense is key to [stop Russia]{.underline}
-- otherwise, [nuclear war]{.underline} and they'll [cut our
cables]{.underline}.**

**[Russia's Northern Fleet submarines]{.underline}** have been a
mainstay of its maritime force posture during the Soviet era and since.
The defense of the maritime component of **[[Russia's nuclear
triad]{.mark} has [historically]{.mark} been the [primary focus]{.mark}
of this force]{.underline}**, with the interdiction of Atlantic SLOCs in
wartime occupying a secondary
role.[1](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/02681307.2022.2030966) Post-Cold
War, however, **[the changing maritime geography of the Arctic, as well
as the evolution of Russia's strategic position, have incentivized an
evolution of the Northern Fleet's subsurface capabilities and
missions]{.underline}**.

After a post-Cold War trough in its capabilities, which saw the Russian
navy's submarine force shrink in size from 266 operational boats in 1991
to 64 in 2000, **[the [fleet embarked on]{.mark} a process of
[modernization]{.mark} to restore both capacity and
capability]{.underline}**.[2](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/02681307.2022.2030966) While
the number of vessels in service is smaller, modernization under the
Russian Federation's 10-year state armament plan, launched in 2010, have
increased the lethality of the force. **[The Russian navy was the
largest beneficiary of the 2010 State Armament Plan, receiving 26.3% of
the roughly RUB10 trillion (about \$140 billion) allocated between 2011
and
2020]{.underline}**.[3](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/02681307.2022.2030966) This
expenditure has underpinned the progress of ambitious projects, such as
the Yasen-class and Yasen-M-class guided missile submarines (SSGNs),
Russia's most advanced nuclear-powered submarines to date. **[The
Russian navy is also [no longer alone in]{.mark} the [subsurface]{.mark}
[space]{.mark}]{.underline}**. It has been **[[joined by GUGI]{.mark},
which fields a number of [special purpose
sub]{.mark}marine[s]{.mark},]{.underline}** including
the **[Belogorod and Khabarovsk]{.underline}** -- two
modified Oscar-class SSGNs that can act as motherships for deep-sea
surveillance assets. These include the **[[Harpsichord
UUV]{.underline}]{.mark}** (unmanned underwater vehicle) and
the **[Losharik]{.underline}** -- a specialized deep-diving vessel ---
**[which can [carry]{.mark} the [nuclear]{.mark}-armed [Poseidon
torpedo]{.mark}]{.underline}**.[4](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/02681307.2022.2030966) These
**[assets [enable]{.mark} the [Russian sub]{.mark}marine force
[to]{.mark} act in a variety of clandestine activities, from
[plac]{.mark}ing [underwater sensors]{.mark} to the [disruption]{.mark}
of an adversary's [sensor]{.mark} networks [and undersea
cables.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

While the decline in the number of submarines in the Russian navy has
continued, this has been offset by **[qualitative improvements in the
force]{.underline}**. As of 2016, **[the [Northern Fleet]{.mark} was
estimated to [comprise 24 active sub]{.mark}marine[s]{.mark}, excluding
SSBNs.]{.underline}**[5](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/02681307.2022.2030966) The
**[[Pacific fleet]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which controls the other major
route of egress from the Arctic, **[has [six]{.mark} SSGNs [and
four]{.mark} Akula-class attack submarines]{.underline}** (SSNs), **[as
well as 11 Kilo-class diesel-electrics]{.underline}** (SSKs), two of
which are the modern improved Kilo.

The **[mission set of the [Russian]{.mark} navy's [submarines has
evolved]{.mark} in a number of ways]{.underline}**. While the protection
of SSBNs remains paramount, **[the Russian submarine fleet has taken on
a number of additional roles.]{.underline}** The force has followed the
rest of the navy by **[[embracing]{.mark} a role in a conventional
[precision strike]{.mark} campaign]{.underline}**. Its
newest **[Yasen-class nuclear submarines have a Vertical Launch System
([VLS]{.mark}) [capacity]{.mark}]{.underline}** that hold up to 40
Kalibr land-attack
missiles.[6](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/02681307.2022.2030966) **[Precision
strike is [crucial to]{.mark} Russia's approach to [localizing
conventional wars]{.mark} on its periphery]{.underline}** -- both by
inflicting calibrated 'assigned damage' on an adversary's society and by
slowing the pace of
deployment.[7](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/02681307.2022.2030966) **[The
ability to launch conventionally armed precision strike assets is
therefore highly beneficial to a service seeking to stake its claim to
limited national resources. The [Russian navy]{.mark}]{.underline}** has
effectively made a case for itself as a **[force [capable of
conducting]{.mark}]{.underline}** a full spectrum of strike operations
ranging from conventional precision strikes to **[[low-yield]{.mark}
nuclear strikes [and]{.mark}, at the top of the escalation ladder,
[strategic nuclear strikes]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Its **[subsurface
assets are central]{.underline}** to its ability to play this
role.[8](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/02681307.2022.2030966) **[Russian
military science scholarship reveals a fear of foreign powers conducting
a conventional strike campaign against the country's
interior]{.underline}**.[9](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/02681307.2022.2030966)

In addition to this function, **[[subsurface assets]{.mark} will be
[critical to]{.mark} any Russian effort to exert [control]{.mark} over
[the NSR]{.mark}]{.underline}**. While it is true that submarines are
less useful as a tool of presence missions than more visible surface
vessels, **[a tacit understanding of the balance of power underneath the
ocean's surface tends to shape the behavior of competing
parties]{.underline}**.[10](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/02681307.2022.2030966) For
example, during the so-called 'Third Battle of the Atlantic', in which
the US and USSR competed to secure an undersea advantage during the Cold
War, both nations sought to demonstrate their ability to, respectively,
break out into the ocean and deny their opponent the ability to do so.
In other words, **[the [subsurface balance of power is an 'elephant in
the room']{.mark}, which [shapes]{.mark} the [behavior of
parties]{.mark} across a range of
scenarios.]{.underline}**[11](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/02681307.2022.2030966)

Finally, **[it is likely that at least a portion of the [Russia]{.mark}n
submarine fleet in the Arctic will attempt to [break out of its
bastions]{.mark} into the North Atlantic [in crisis and
wartime]{.mark}]{.underline}**, though analysts debate the relative
weight placed on this
mission.[12](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/02681307.2022.2030966) **[[Special
purpose sub]{.mark}marine[s]{.mark} such as the
GUGI-controlled Belgorod can potentially play a crucial role in a range
of scenarios given potential co[ercive value]{.mark} of their ability to
[impact]{.mark} the functioning of [undersea
cables]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Similarly, **[if Russian Arctic-based
SSGNs manage to get into the Norwegian Sea or the Atlantic, they could
in principle [threaten infrastructure]{.mark} such as bases hosting

finding cables easier and faster. In]{.underline}** time-sensitive
military or diplomatic operations, the loss of communications for a few
minutes or hours can be catastrophic. With financial transactions, the
loss of even fractions of a second can cost millions of dollars as
high-speed trades miss their targets and other transactions fail to go
through or are lost entirely. The dozens of cable outages that occur
each year do not cause a complete loss of service, but they do slow
data-transfer speeds as information is re-routed through fewer intact
cables. Most of these cable breaks happen in relatively shallow water,
when rough weather moves cables around until they break or fishing
trawlers catch a cable in a net. Some outages, however, have more
nefarious origins. In 2013, three divers with hand tools cut the main
cable connecting Egypt with Europe, reducing Egypt's Internet bandwidth
by 60%.

**[[Repairing]{.mark} a submarine [cable]{.mark} at sea [is
difficult]{.mark}]{.underline}** and time consuming. First the
**[[break]{.mark} has to be [located using built-in monitoring]{.mark}
systems that can [indicate]{.mark} the cable [segment in which the break
is likely to have occurred]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} **[Cable
repair ships]{.underline}** then **[must go to that
location]{.underline}** and pull up the cable until they get to the
damaged spot. A new section of cable can then be spliced in, which can
take several days to complete.

In addition to the cables themselves, their onshore **[[termination
points]{.mark} are [particularly vulnerable]{.mark}]{.underline}** --
**[and easier to find]{.underline}** than a submerged cable. Sometimes
**[consisting of a non-descript building on a beach or
marshland]{.underline}**, these locations are often the junction of
several cables that are then connected with terrestrial phone and
cellular networks. An **[[accident or attack]{.underline}]{.mark}** on
one of them could have the same effect, in the **[[short-term, of
cutting multiple cables at once]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Because they are
easier to monitor, a break at the termination point could be diagnosed
more quickly; but it may be harder to repair because more damage could
be caused to an exposed cable than one hundreds of feet underwater.

As more cables are installed on the ocean floor, redundancy will
increase the resilience of communication networks. But as the case of
Egypt shows, the reduction of bandwidth from cutting one or more cables
can still be significant. Although communications are not completely
lost, lowered bandwidth may have a similar effect on time-critical
transmissions as a complete loss of connectivity. For example, stock
exchanges must be tightly synchronized for buyers and sellers to work
off the same prices. Similarly, military cryptology systems tie codes to
time standards; if bandwidth goes down, networks can "drop synch" and be
unable to properly decode messages.

Given the likely economic and military impacts of cable breaks, the
ability to threaten or protect submarine cables and their shore landings
will be increasingly important in future conflicts. In a crisis, an
aggressor could use multiple coordinated attacks on cables to compel an
opponent to back down or employ them as part of an opening offensive to
cut off the defender's military forces from national commanders,
intelligence data, and sensor information. [**[Cable attacks
could]{.underline}**]{.mark} also **[[be]{.mark} highly

The good news for us is that scientists think the world will be
habitable for at least a few hundred million more years. **[The bad news
is there's a lot that could change that]{.underline}**. The risk of the
threats highlighted in the report actually causing mass casualties are
still small, but that doesn't mean they're not important to pay
attention to --- especially when the worst-case scenario means human
extinction. Here's what should be keeping you up at night and what,
realistically, might cause humans to go the way of dinosaurs. **[1)
[Nuclear war]{.mark} A nuclear [detonation]{.mark} from one of today's
more powerful weapons would cause a fatality rate of 80 to 95 percent in
the blast zone stretching out to a radius of 4 kilometers --- although
"severe damage" could reach six times as far.]{.underline}** But it
isn't just the immediate deaths we need to worry about --- **[it's the
[nuclear winter]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This is when the clouds of dust
and smoke released shroud the planet and block out the sun, **[[causing
temperatures to drop]{.mark}, possibly [for years]{.mark}. If [4,000
nuclear weapons were detonated]{.mark} --- a possibility [in]{.mark} the

**[[Russia's massive]{.mark} 70-warship [Ocean Shield]{.mark} exercise
in the Baltic Sea last year [signaled]{.mark} the Kremlin's [intention
to be the dominating Arctic power]{.mark} [militarily and
economically]{.mark}]{.underline}**, two international security experts
said Tuesday.

"The **[[complexity of exercises]{.mark} has [expanded]{.mark}
significantly over the last twelve years]{.underline}**" as **[Moscow
has [pushed conventional and nuclear military modernization]{.mark}
programs forward to assert its dominance regionally]{.underline}**,
Katarzyna Zysk, head of the Centre for Security Policy at Norway's
Institute of Defence Studies, said in a Center for Strategic and
International Studies online forum on June 30.

The **[exercises]{.underline}**, often unannounced, **[are more
sophisticated now than when they resumed following Russia's moves
against Georgia and later Ukraine]{.underline}**. They **[involve [joint
land, air and naval forces]{.mark} in combined operations, "[making it
less predictable" to NATO planners]{.mark} in assessing the immediate
and long-term goals of the Russian military.]{.underline}**

But what is clear from this stepped-up tempo is that the "**[Russian
military [force in the Arctic]{.mark} is [not necessarily]{.mark} going
to [stay in the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}**," she added. This can mean
**[exerting [pressure]{.mark} from the [Baltic]{.mark} to the [Black
Sea]{.mark}, as it did by moving warships closer to Ukraine and also
showing the flag in the eastern [Mediterranean]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

Heather Conley, director of CSIS' Europe program, said at the event that
the **[United States and NATO "just can't seem to get it
right"]{.underline}** when it comes to Arctic security. **[The
shortfalls run from the U.S. level of investment]{.underline}** in
ice-hardened warships and icebreakers to many European nations
downplaying the risks in the region to the alliance.

"**[[We have to make]{.mark} those [investments]{.mark},]{.underline}**"
so the United States can demonstrate its credible presence in the North
Atlantic and the North Pacific, Conley said. She added that **[presence
would translate into conducting freedom of navigation operations in the
Arctic]{.underline}**, as well as responding to manmade or natural
disaster and assisting in search and rescue. It also would mean more
**[exercises like Trident Juncture to give U.S. and NATO forces real
training in harsh conditions.]{.underline}**

"**[[We have to have access" to]{.mark} what some call [the "Fifth
Ocean]{.mark}]{.underline}**," she said.

For the Russians, **[the Northern Sea Route \[[NSR]{.mark}\] through
Arctic water is an [economic lifeline]{.mark} in its exporting of energy
to major consumers like China]{.underline}**. Conley said the route also
**[offers]{.underline}** them **[advantages in moving naval forces from
one ocean to another as the situation demands]{.underline}**. That
flexibility overcomes shortcomings in its shipbuilding and its
modernization of its blue-water fleet.

The **[Northern Sea Route]{.underline}**, which is now more often free
of ice**[, is also the [reason why]{.mark} [they are building]{.mark}
airfields and other [military facilities]{.mark} from the Pacific back
toward the Kola Peninsula.]{.underline}**

**[In the west on the [Kola Peninsula]{.mark}]{.underline}**, the home
of the Northern Fleet with **[[ballistic missile and attack
submarines]{.mark} and surface combatants]{.underline}**, Conley said
the Kremlin has maintained "**[a significant [conventional
deterrent]{.mark}" in terms of aircraft, including [strategic bombers
and advanced fighters]{.mark}, as well as [S-400
radars]{.mark}]{.underline}**. She estimated **[[60 percent of the naval
assets]{.mark} based there "are doing territorial defense" through
anti-access/area denial missions.]{.underline}**

But, as Zysk added, **[the Kremlin also "has successfully modernized its
submarine ballistic fleet]{.underline}**" to assert its offensive reach
from the Kola Peninsula. In fact, she said this was Moscow's top
military priority when it upped its defense spending in 2010: to
maintain "nuclear deterrence and second-strike capability."

Although Russia's shipbuilding has sputtered in delivering large ships
such as aircraft carriers and in overhauling aging Cold War-era
cruisers, Zysk saw its defense industrial base "pushing harder and
harder" in developing precision weapons, hypersonic cruise missiles,
robotic mines, and nuclear-capable drones.

The weapons are effective as offensive threats and deterrents, she said.

But as effective as these new systems are, Zysk said the **[Russians
still realize that "having a blue-water navy is symbolic of a great
power]{.underline}**," and they **[haven't shelved that as a long-term
objective.]{.underline}**

At the same time as the Kremlin has boosted the number of military
exercises, it also has increasingly tested NATO's defenses. Zysk said
Russia has simulated attacks on potential major targets and used
electromagnetic jamming to cripple GPS in Norway. "There's great
uncertainty \[in Norway over\] these kinds of activity."

Conley said that uncertainty marks much of Russia's military activity in
the far north. The lack of transparency of Russian military activities
-- from announcing exercises to reporting accidents in the Arctic --
raises the stakes of a miscalculation of intent. She specifically cited
the secrecy that surrounded the deaths of 14 crew members in a fire
aboard a deep-sea submersible in the Barents Sea as an example of why a
new international forum was needed to address Arctic security concerns.

The bottom line is **[[NATO and the]{.mark} United States \[[US\] "need
maritime]{.mark} and air [awareness" in the Arctic to effectively
deter]{.mark} an assertive [Russia]{.mark} as arms control agreements
lapse]{.underline}**. Conley added, "we do not have the capability or
the experience to operate there."

In early March, an estimated **[7,500 American combat troops will travel
to Norway to join thousands of soldiers from other [NATO]{.mark}
countries in a massive [mock battle]{.mark} with imagined invading
forces from Russia]{.underline}**. In this futuristic **[simulated
engagement]{.underline}**---it goes by the name of **[Exercise Cold
Response 2020]{.underline}**---allied forces will "conduct
**[multinational joint exercises with a high-intensity combat scenario
in demanding winter conditions,"]{.underline}** or so claims the
Norwegian military anyway. At first glance, this may look like any other
NATO training exercise, but think again. There's nothing ordinary about
Cold Response 2020. As a start, it's being **[[staged]{.mark} above the
[Arctic Circle]{.mark}, far from any previous traditional NATO
battlefield, and it [raises]{.mark} to a new level the [possibility
of]{.mark} a great-power conflict that might end in a [nuclear exchange
and mutual annihilation]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}
**[Welcome]{.underline}**, in other words, **[to [World War III's newest
battlefield]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

For the soldiers participating in the exercise, the potentially
**[thermonuclear dimensions of Cold Response 2020]{.underline}** may not
be obvious. At its start, Marines from the United States and the United
Kingdom will practice massive **[[amphibious landings]{.mark} along
[Norway's coastline]{.mark}, much as they do in similar exercises
elsewhere in the world]{.underline}**. Once ashore, however, the
scenario becomes ever more distinctive. **[After collecting tanks and
other heavy weaponry "prepositioned" in caves in Norway's interior, the
[Marines]{.mark} will proceed toward the country's far-northern Finnmark
region to [help Norwegian forces stave off Russia]{.mark}n forces
supposedly pouring across the border]{.underline}**. From then on, the
**[two sides will engage in]{.underline}**---to use current Pentagon
terminology---**[[high-intensity combat]{.mark} operations under Arctic
conditions (a type of warfare not seen on such a scale since World War
II).]{.underline}**

And that's just the beginning. Unbeknownst to most Americans, the
**[[Finnmark]{.mark} region of Norway and adjacent Russian territory
have become one of the most [likely battlegrounds]{.mark} for the first
[use of nuclear weapons in]{.mark} any future [NATO-Russian
conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Because **[[Moscow]{.mark} has
[concentrated]{.mark} a significant part of its [nuclear]{.mark}
retaliatory [capability on the Kola Peninsula]{.mark}, a remote stretch
of land abutting northern Norway---any US-NATO success in actual combat
with Russian forces near that territory would endanger a significant
part of Russia's nuclear arsenal]{.underline}** and so might precipitate
the early use of such munitions. Even a simulated victory---the
predictable result of Cold Response 2020---will undoubtedly set Russia's
nuclear controllers on edge.

To appreciate just how risky any NATO-Russian clash in Norway's far
north would be, consider the region's geography and the strategic
factors that have led Russia to concentrate so much military power
there. And all of this, by the way, will be playing out in the context
of another existential danger: climate change. The melting of the Arctic
ice cap and the accelerated exploitation of Arctic resources are lending
this area ever greater strategic significance.

**[ENERGY EXTRACTION IN THE FAR NORTH]{.underline}**

Look at any map of Europe and you'll note that Scandinavia widens as it
heads southward into the most heavily populated parts of Denmark,
Finland, Norway, and Sweden. As you head north, however, it narrows and
becomes ever less populated. At its extreme northern reaches, only a
thin band of Norway juts east to touch Russia's Kola Peninsula. To the
north, the Barents Sea, an offshoot of the Arctic Ocean, bounds them
both. This remote region---approximately 800 miles from Oslo and 900
miles from Moscow---has, in recent years, become a vortex of economic
and military activity.

Once prized as a source of vital minerals, especially nickel, iron ore,
and phosphates, this remote area is now the center of extensive oil and
natural gas extraction. **[With temperatures rising in the Arctic twice
as fast as anywhere else on the planet]{.underline}** and sea ice
retreating ever farther north every year, offshore fossil-fuel
exploration has become increasingly viable. As a result, **[large
reserves of oil and natural gas]{.underline}**---the very fuels whose
combustion is responsible for those rising temperatures---**[have been
discovered beneath the Barents Sea and both countries are seeking to
exploit those deposits]{.underline}**. Norway has taken the lead,
establishing at Hammerfest in Finnmark the world's first plant above the
Arctic Circle to export liquified natural gas. In a similar fashion,
Russia has initiated efforts to exploit the mammoth Shtokman gas field
in its sector of the Barents Sea, though it has yet to bring such plans
to fruition.

For Russia, even more significant oil and gas prospects lie further east
in the Kara and Pechora Seas and on the Yamal Peninsula, a slender
extension of Siberia. Its energy companies have, in fact, already begun
producing oil at the Prirazlomnoye field in the Pechora Sea and the
Novoportovskoye field on that peninsula (and natural gas there as well).
Such fields hold great promise for Russia, which exhibits all the
characteristics of a petro-state, but there's one huge problem: The only
practical way to get that output to market is via specially designed
icebreaker-tankers sent through the Barents Sea past northern Norway.

The exploitation of Arctic oil and gas resources and their transport to
markets in Europe and Asia has become a major economic priority for
Moscow as its hydrocarbon reserves below the Arctic Circle begin to dry
up. Despite calls at home for greater economic diversity, President
Vladimir Putin's regime continues to insist on the centrality of
hydrocarbon production to the country's economic future. In that
context, production in the Arctic has become an essential national
objective, which, in turn, requires assured access to the Atlantic Ocean
via the Barents Sea and Norway's offshore waters. Think of that waterway
as vital to Russia's energy economy in the way the Strait of Hormuz,
connecting the Persian Gulf to the Indian Ocean, is to the Saudis and
other regional fossil-fuel producers.

**[THE MILITARY DIMENSION]{.underline}**

No less than **[[Russia's]{.underline}]{.mark}** giant energy firms,
**[its [navy]{.mark} [must]{.mark} be able to [enter]{.mark} the
Atlantic [via the Barents Sea]{.mark} and northern
Norway]{.underline}**. **[Aside from its Baltic and Black Sea ports,
accessible to the Atlantic only via passageways easily obstructed by
NATO, the sole Russian harbor with unfettered access to the Atlantic
Ocean is at Murmansk on the Kola Peninsula.]{.underline}** Not
surprisingly then, **[that port is also the headquarters for Russia's
Northern Fleet---its most powerful]{.underline}**---and the **[site of
numerous air, infantry, missile, and radar bases along with naval
shipyards and nuclear reactors.]{.underline}** In other words, it's
among **[the most sensitive military regions in Russia
today.]{.underline}**

Given all this, President Putin has substantially rebuilt that very
fleet, which fell into disrepair after the collapse of the Soviet Union,
equipping it with some of the country's most advanced warships. In 2018,
according to The Military Balance, a publication of the International
Institute for Strategic Studies, it already possessed the largest number
of modern cruisers and destroyers (10) of any Russian fleet, along with
22 attack submarines and numerous support vessels. Also in the Murmansk
area are dozens of advanced MiG fighter planes and a wide assortment of
anti-aircraft defense systems. Finally, as 2019 ended, Russian military
officials indicated for the first time that they had deployed to the
Arctic the Kinzhal air-launched ballistic missile, a weapon capable of
hypersonic velocities (more than five times the speed of sound), again
presumably to a base in the Murmansk region just 125 miles from Norway's
Finnmark, the site of the upcoming NATO exercise.

More significant yet is the way **[[Moscow]{.mark} has been
[strengthening]{.mark} its [nuclear forces]{.mark} in the
region]{.underline}**. Like the United States, Russia maintains a
"triad" of nuclear delivery systems, including intercontinental
ballistic missiles (ICBMs), long-range "heavy" bombers, and
submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs). Under the terms of the
New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START), signed by the two
countries in 2010, **[the Russians can [deploy]{.mark} no more than 700
delivery systems capable of carrying no more than [1,550
warheads]{.mark}]{.underline}**. (That pact will, however, expire in
February 2021 unless the two sides agree to an extension, which appears
increasingly unlikely in the age of Trump.) According to the Arms
Control Association, the Russians are currently believed to be deploying
the warheads they are allowed under New START on 66 heavy bombers, 286
ICBMs, and 12 submarines with 160 SLBMs. Eight of those nuclear-armed
subs are, in fact, assigned to the Northern Fleet, which means about 110
missiles with as many as 500 warheads---the exact numbers remain
shrouded in secrecy---are deployed in the Murmansk area. 

For Russian nuclear strategists, such **[[nuclear-armed
submarines]{.mark} are considered the most "survivable" of the country's
retaliatory systems]{.underline}**. In the event of a nuclear exchange
with the United States, **[the country's [heavy bombers and
ICBMs]{.mark} could prove relatively vulnerable to pre-emptive strikes
as their locations are known and can be targeted by American bombs and
missiles with near-pinpoint accuracy]{.underline}**. Those subs,
however, can leave Murmansk and disappear into the wide Atlantic Ocean
at the onset of any crisis and so presumably remain hidden from US
spying eyes. **[To do so, however, [requires]{.mark} that they pass
through the [Barents Sea, avoiding]{.mark} the [NATO forces]{.mark}
lurking nearby]{.underline}**. For Moscow, in other words, the very
possibility of **[deterring a US nuclear strike hinges on its ability to
defend its naval stronghold in Murmansk, while maneuvering its
submarines past Norway's Finnmark region]{.underline}**. No wonder,
then, that this area has assumed enormous strategic importance for
Russian military planners---and the upcoming Cold Response 2020 is sure
to prove challenging to them.

**[WASHINGTON'S ARCTIC BUILDUP]{.underline}**

During the Cold War era, Washington viewed the Arctic as a significant
strategic arena and constructed a string of military bases across the
region. Their main aim: to intercept Soviet bombers and missiles
crossing the North Pole on their way to targets in North America. After
the Soviet Union imploded in 1991, Washington abandoned many of those
bases. Now, however, with the Pentagon once again identifying "great
power competition" with Russia and China as the defining characteristic
of the present strategic environment, many of those bases are being
reoccupied and new ones established. Once again, the Arctic is being
viewed as a potential site of conflict with Russia and, as a result, US
forces are being readied for possible combat there.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was the first official to explain this
new strategic outlook at the Arctic Forum in Finland last May. In his
address, a kind of "**[Pompeo Doctrine," he indicated that the United
States was shifting from benign neglect of the region to aggressive
involvement and militarization.]{.underline}** "We're entering a new age
of strategic engagement in the Arctic," he insisted, "complete with new
threats to the Arctic and its real estate, and to all of our interests
in that region." To better protect those interests against Russia's
military buildup there, "**[we are fortifying America's security and
diplomatic presence in the area]{.underline}**...hosting military
exercises, strengthening our force presence, rebuilding our icebreaker
fleet, expanding Coast Guard funding, and creating a new senior military
post for Arctic Affairs inside of our own military."

The Pentagon has been unwilling to provide many details, but a close
reading of the military press suggests that this activity has been
particularly focused on northern Norway and adjacent waters. To begin
with, the Marine Corps has established a permanent presence in that
country, the first time foreign forces have been stationed there since
German troops occupied it during World War II. A detachment of about 330
Marines were initially deployed near the port of Trondheim in 2017,
presumably to help guard nearby caves that contain hundreds of US tanks
and combat vehicles. Two years later, a similarly sized group was then
dispatched to the Troms region above the Arctic Circle and far closer to
the Russian border.

From the Russian perspective, even more threatening is the construction
of a US radar station on the Norwegian island of Vardø about 40 miles
from the Kola Peninsula. To be operated in conjunction with the
Norwegian intelligence service, the focus of the facility will evidently
be to snoop on those Russian missile-carrying submarines, assumedly in
order to target them and take them out in the earliest stages of any
conflict. That Moscow fears just such an outcome is evident from the
mock attack it staged on the Vardø facility in 2018, sending 11 Su-24
supersonic bombers on a direct path toward the island. (They turned
aside at the last moment.) It has also moved a surface-to-surface
missile battery to a spot just 40 miles from Vardø.

In addition, in August 2018, the US Navy decided to reactivate the
previously decommissioned Second Fleet in the North Atlantic. "A new
Second Fleet increases our strategic flexibility to respond---from the
Eastern Seaboard to the Barents Sea," said Chief of Naval Operations
John Richardson at the time. As last year ended, that fleet was declared
fully operational.

**[DECIPHERING COLD RESPONSE 2020]{.underline}**

Exercise Cold Response 2020 must be viewed in the context of all these
developments. Few details about the thinking behind the upcoming war
games have been made public, but it's not hard to imagine what at least
part of the scenario might be like: a US-Russian clash of some sort
leading to Russian attacks aimed at seizing that radar station at Vardø
and Norway's defense headquarters at Bodø on the country's northwestern
coast. The invading troops will be slowed but not stopped by Norwegian
forces (and those US Marines stationed in the area), while thousands of
reinforcements from NATO bases elsewhere in Europe begin to pour in.
Eventually, of course, the tide will turn and the Russians will be
forced back.

No matter what the official scenario is like, however, for Pentagon
planners the situation will go far beyond this. **[Any [Russian
assault]{.mark} on critical Norwegian military facilities [would]{.mark}
presumably [be preceded by]{.mark} intense [air and missile
bombardment]{.mark} and the forward deployment of major naval
vessels.]{.underline}** This, in turn, would prompt comparable moves by
the United States and NATO, probably resulting in violent encounters and
the loss of major assets on all sides. In the process, **[Russia's [key
nuclear retaliatory forces]{.mark} would be [at risk]{.mark} and quickly
placed on high alert with senior officers operating in hair-trigger
mode]{.underline}**. **[Any [misstep]{.mark}]{.underline}** might then
**[[lead to]{.underline}]{.mark}** what humanity has feared since August
1945: **[a [nuclear apocalypse]{.mark} on Planet Earth.]{.underline}**

There is no way to know to what degree such considerations are
incorporated into the classified versions of the Cold Response 2020
scenario, but it's unlikely that they're missing. Indeed, a 2016 version
of the exercise involved the participation of three B-52 nuclear bombers
from the US Strategic Air Command, indicating that the American military
is keenly aware of the escalatory risks of any large-scale US-Russian
encounter in the Arctic.

In short, what might otherwise seem like a routine training exercise in
a distant part of the world is actually part of an emerging US strategy
to overpower Russia in a critical defensive zone, an approach that could
easily result in nuclear war. The Russians are, of course, well aware of
this and so will undoubtedly be watching Cold Response 2020 with genuine
trepidation. Their fears are understandable---but we should all be
concerned about a strategy that seemingly embodies such a high risk of
future escalation.

Ever since the Soviets acquired nuclear weapons of their own in 1949,
strategists have wondered how and where an all-out nuclear
war---**[World War III---would break out.]{.underline}** At one time,
that incendiary scenario was believed most likely to involve a clash
over the divided city of Berlin or along the East-West border in
Germany. After the Cold War, however, fears of such a deadly encounter
evaporated and few gave much thought to such possibilities. Looking
forward today, however, the prospect of a **[catastrophic World War III
is again becoming all too imaginable and this time,]{.underline}** it
appears, an incident **[in the [Arctic could]{.mark} prove the
[spark]{.mark} for [Armageddon]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**All of NATO is key -- Worldwide conflict [quickly
follows]{.underline}.**

The primary forward **[deployed component]{.underline}** of the
**[[US]{.mark} naval]{.underline}** commitment **[to Europe is
four Arleigh [Burke-class]{.mark} destroyers based at Rota, [in
Spain]{.mark}, and four P-8A [Orions]{.mark} at Sigonella, [in
Sicily]{.mark}]{.underline}**. While the primary purpose of the Arleigh
Burkes is their **[contributions to the ballistic missile defense (BMD)
system]{.underline}** envisioned as part of the European Phased Adaptive
Approach, **[the vessels are [ASW
capable]{.mark}]{.underline}**.[50](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/02681307.2022.2030966) Arleigh
Burkes are **[equipped with the AN/SQR-19 towed-array
sonar,]{.underline}** as well as the AN/SQS-53C hull-mounted
sonar.[51](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/02681307.2022.2030966) It
is, however, **[an open question whether any of these vessels will be
diverted from their primary mission of BMD in an Arctic
scenario.]{.underline}**

The **[reconstitution of the US Navy's Second
Fleet]{.underline}**,[52](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/02681307.2022.2030966) and
a series of recent visits to northern waters by assets such as
the Seawolf-class submarine, **[suggest that the US will
[maintain]{.mark} a [large]{.mark}r number of [assets]{.mark} engaged
[in the northern theatre]{.mark} of the European region in the
future]{.underline}**. At present, **[if it is correct to assume that
the US will strive to maintain [60%]{.mark} of its [SSN fleet in the
Indo-Pacific]{.mark} at any given time, this would leave approximately
21 out of the remaining 51 vessels available for
deployment.]{.underline}**[53](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/02681307.2022.2030966) If
one assumes a high peacetime **[readiness rate of 80%]{.underline}** of
the fleet being at -- or close to -- readiness, this **[implies that 16
vessels would in theory be available for deployment to northern European
waters.]{.underline}** Following work done by other analysts on the
subject of rapid redeployment, we assume **[a baseline of 50% of vessels
capable of redeploying in the early stages of a conflict]{.underline}**,
which would **[imply that approximately eight submarines could rapidly
redeploy to Europe in the first week of a conflict]{.underline}** --
though fewer than this may be deployed, given the existence of other
missions beyond great power
competition.[54](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/02681307.2022.2030966) On
the other hand, **[given a month to build up assets in the region, it
can be assumed that [13 SSNs]{.mark}]{.underline}** -- 70% of the
available force -- **[could be [deployed]{.mark} to NATO's northern
flank.]{.underline}** Similarly, one might expect to see an **[initially
limited number of surface combatants reallocated to northern Europe in a
crisis]{.underline}**, with institutions such as Sweden's FOI placing
the number at four to seven in a week. **[Not all US surface assets
deployed to Europe in a crisis involving Russia will be allocated to the
High North]{.underline}**. **[[Missions in the Baltic]{.mark} Sea
[and]{.mark} the [Atlantic]{.mark} will also likely [take up
resources]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The authors assume, therefore, that
half the available assets will be allocated to High North
missions.[55](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/02681307.2022.2030966)

For the purpose of this analysis, the authors assume that allied
**[fleets such as the [Royal Navy]{.mark} and the [French navy]{.mark}
are likely to be able to [contribute]{.mark} a maximum of [three
ASW]{.mark}-optimized [frigates]{.mark} apiece in the first weeks of a
crisis and up to six after 30
days]{.underline}**.[56](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/02681307.2022.2030966) Currently,
**[the Royal Navy would likely deploy its Type-23 frigate, though the
arrival of the more modern Type-26 as a replacement is
imminent]{.underline}**. While the Royal Navy expects to field 12
frigates (FFGs), including eight Type-26s by the late 2020s, **[the
demands of force protection for the UK's carrier battle groups are
likely to compete with other
missions]{.underline}**.[57](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/02681307.2022.2030966) **[The
French navy maintains a similar force]{.underline}**, though in any
crisis involving **[[Russia]{.mark} it may well [see Mediterranean
security as a competing priority, given]{.mark} the activity of the
[Black Sea fleet]{.mark} in this
area]{.underline}**.[58](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/02681307.2022.2030966) It
is assumed that **[Allies such as [Germany and Italy]{.mark} would
[allocate]{.mark} their [ASW-capable vessels]{.mark} closer to home in
regions such as the Baltic Sea and Mediterranean in any conflict
involving Russia]{.underline}**. The Royal Navy has three Astute-class
SSNs in active service, with another four entering service in the 2020s.
It is assumed that the Royal Navy can deploy between one and three SSNs
to the Arctic at present, based on the force likely to be available to
the service over the course of the 2020s, and up to five over a longer
period.[59](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/02681307.2022.2030966) **[Britain
expects to deploy nine P-8 Poseidon MPAs]{.underline}**, while **[France
sends 18 Atlantique II planes]{.underline}**. Assuming a **[readiness
rate of 50%,]{.underline}** and the division of French assets discussed
earlier, it is estimated that **[roughly four to six MPAs are available
from each state over the course of a week and a month,
respectively]{.underline}**.[60](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/02681307.2022.2030966)

Regional navies such as the **[[Belgian, Norwegian and Danish]{.mark}
navies]{.underline}** will likely be **[able to [contribute]{.mark} one
or two [ASW]{.mark}-capable vessels]{.underline}** and, in the case of
Norway, one or two SSKs at short notice. The **[Royal Norwegian air
force expects to deploy five Poseidons by the
mid-2020s]{.underline}**.[61](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/02681307.2022.2030966) In
addition NATO members **[[Germany and Italy]{.mark} could contribute one
or two MPAs]{.underline}** -- although **[their [focus]{.mark} is likely
to be [on the Baltic]{.mark} Sea [and]{.mark} the
[Mediterranean]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**[Implications for the United States]{.underline}**

**[A [wider European conflict]{.mark} would pose the [stiffest challenge
to]{.mark} the global [standing of the]{.mark} United States [\[US\]
since the]{.mark} end of the [Cold War]{.mark} and to the [international
system]{.mark} it has built and underwritten for [decades
longer]{.mark}.]{.underline}** It would **[[test]{.mark} the durability
of its global system of [alliances]{.mark} and the [efficacy of
international regimes]{.mark} and institutions that have guarded world
peace]{.underline}**, **[security, and prosperity]{.underline}**. The
**[challenge would come [at a time when the]{.mark} United States
\[[US]{.mark}\] itself is in immense disarray]{.underline}**, as a
**[[deeply polarized polity]{.mark} confronts massive domestic
problems---]{.underline}**the **[pandemic, inflation, racial justice,
and cultural wars]{.underline}**---**[that [leave less time and fewer
resources for foreign matters]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The United States
will be tested to see whether it can muster the will, energy, and
creativity to execute an effective policy toward the unfolding crisis in
Europe.

**[At home, public attention has been focused on developments in and
around Ukraine]{.underline}**, but the Joe **[[Biden]{.mark}
administration [cannot ignore the home front]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In
response to U.S.-levied sanctions, **[[Russia]{.mark} can be expected to
[step up its cyber op]{.mark}eration[s]{.mark} against the United
States]{.underline}**. It will more actively **[[sow
disinformation]{.mark}, seek to [exacerbate domestic tension]{.mark}s,
and]{.underline} ~~paralyze~~ [[\[inhibit\] critical
infrastructure]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The severity of the attacks will
likely rise in proportion to the harshness of the sanctions Washington
levies on Moscow.

Abroad, **[[the fate of the transatlantic community]{.mark}, a central
pillar of U.S. security and prosperity, [would be a
stake]{.mark}]{.underline}**. One of the Biden administration's
priorities, as laid out in the Interim National Security Strategy
Guidance released in March 2021, is repairing U.S.
alliances---especially with Europe---after four disruptive years under
President Donald Trump. Although relations are more cordial, significant
substantive differences remain and the willingness of allies to align
behind a common purpose for the long haul remains questionable.

The United States' allies have rallied behind a harsh set of sanctions
in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but **[[preserving
unity]{.mark} as the conflict drags on [remains a challenge]{.mark},
especially if sacrifice is spread unevenly across NATO, as will likely
be the case. [Putin]{.mark} will seek to [exploit divisions]{.mark}
through differentiated levels of pressure on NATO members, targeted
energy cutoffs, offers of negotiation, and the like to most
[advance]{.mark} two long-standing Russian goals: the [end of
NATO]{.mark} as a collective defense organization [and]{.mark} the
[erosion of]{.mark} the foundations of [the EU]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
Should he succeed, **[the [new orde]{.mark}r]{.underline}** that would
emerge in Europe is far from certain. But **[[Russia]{.mark} would
undoubtedly [play a central role]{.mark} in its formulation, and almost
any conceivable new order would [diminish the power and role of
the]{.mark} United States \[[US]{.mark}\] on the
continent.]{.underline}**

**[A similar situation obtains in the [Indo-Pacific]{.mark}
region]{.underline}**. The **[[Biden]{.mark} administration spent 2021
[bolstering relations with]{.mark} its allies and
partners]{.underline}**---energizing **[[the Quad]{.underline}]{.mark}**
(the United States, Australia, India, and Japan), and **[cutting a
submarine deal with the United Kingdom and Australia---[to mee]{.mark}t
the growing strategic challenge posed by [China]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
A **[major, [prolonged]{.mark} European [distraction]{.mark} could
[undo]{.mark} further efforts to [pivot to Asia]{.mark}, [raise doubts
among allies]{.mark} and partners [about]{.mark} the
[cred]{.mark}ibility [of the U.S]{.mark}. commitment, and [free China to
pursue its objectives with greater vigor. The]{.mark} United States
\[[US]{.mark}\] could [avoid this outcome by]{.mark}]{.underline}**
pursuing lesser goals in Europe---leading to the quicker development of
a new order less favorable to American interests---or by **[[a massive
buildup of]{.mark} its [military capabilities]{.mark} that would enable
it to play a major, perhaps decisive, role in both
regions]{.underline}**. The latter would have to come at the cost of the
Biden administration's domestic priorities. Whether the Biden
administration could muster sufficient domestic political support, if it
decided to move in this direction, is far from certain.

In addition to regional challenges, **[a major [European
conflict]{.mark} would also [stress]{.mark} critical [international
regimes]{.mark} and institutions]{.underline}**. One of the first
victims would likely be the **[[arms control]{.mark}
regime]{.underline}** that has served as the foundation of strategic
nuclear stability for the past fifty-plus years. The United States
withdrew from some central elements---including **[the Anti-Ballistic
Missiles (ABM) and the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF)
treaties]{.underline}**---but two critical elements have remained in
place: the New START treaty and the Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT). **[A
wider conflict in Europe would all but [guarantee]{.mark} that the
United States and Russia could [no]{.mark}t agree to a
[follow-on]{.mark} treaty [to]{.mark} the [New START]{.mark} treaty
before it expires in 2026, and the NPT review conference tentatively
scheduled for August 2022 would fall by the wayside]{.underline}**. As a
consequence, the incipient arms race now underway, fueled by new
technologies---hypersonics, cyber tools, and artificial
intelligence---would accelerate. **[[A new wave of nuclear
prolif]{.mark}eration [could ensue]{.mark}, especially if U.S. allies
and partners lose faith in America's commitment to extended
deterrence.]{.underline}** Mutually assured destruction, which for
better or worse has anchored strategic stability since the early 1970s,
would be severely stressed in a multipolar nuclear landscape with Russia
and the United States fighting at least a proxy war.

Likewise, **[a [broader conflict]{.mark} in Europe [would
stress]{.mark},]{.underline}** perhaps to the breaking point,
**[[the]{.mark} United Nations \[[UN]{.mark}\] and many of its auxiliary
organizations]{.underline}**. Already stymied by a growing rift between
the Western permanent members and Russia and China, the Security Council
would have failed in its primary reason for being---to prevent the
outbreak of a major conflict in Europe. It could continue to exist as a
forum for the airing of grievances and acrimonious debate, but it would
serve little purpose as a platform for addressing major global issues.

Finally, **[the humanitarian costs of a wider conflict in Europe would
be staggering]{.underline}**, particularly given the destructiveness of
modern weapons. Beyond the physical destruction and loss of life, untold
numbers of refugees would flow across borders not only into Central East
Europe but perhaps further West depending on the scale of the fighting.
**[The strain on the socioeconomic systems]{.underline}**---coming on
top of the stress of the two-year-old pandemic, economic dislocation,
and mounting inflation---**[could bring some close to
collapse.]{.underline}**

**Harari '18** \[Yuval; September 26; Professor of History at Hebrew
University of Jerusalem; \"We need a post-liberal order now,\"
https://www.economist.com/open-future/2018/09/26/we-need-a-post-liberal-order-now\]

**[If the liberal order is collapsing, what new kind of global order
might [replace]{.mark} it?]{.underline}** So far, **[those who challenge
[the liberal order]{.mark}]{.underline}** do so mainly on a national
level. They have many ideas about how to advance the interests of their
particular country, but they **[don't have a viable vision for how the
world as a whole should function]{.underline}**. For example, Russian
nationalism can be a reasonable guide for running the affairs of Russia,
but Russian nationalism has no plan for the rest of humanity. Unless, of
course, nationalism morphs into imperialism, and calls for one nation to
conquer and rule the entire world. A century ago, several nationalist
movements indeed harboured such imperialist fantasies. Today's
nationalists, whether in Russia, Turkey, Italy or China, so far refrain
from advocating global conquest.

In place of violently establishing a global empire, **[some
nationalists]{.underline}** such as Steve Bannon, Viktor Orban, the
Northern League in Italy and the British Brexiteers dream about a
peaceful "Nationalist International". They **[argue]{.underline}** that
all nations today face the same enemies. The bogeymen of globalism,
multiculturalism and immigration are threatening to destroy the
traditions and identities of all nations. Therefore nationalists across
the world should make common cause in opposing these global forces.
Hungarians, Italians, Turks and Israelis should build walls, erect
fences and slow down the movement of people, goods, money and ideas.

**[The world will]{.underline}** then **[be divided into distinct
nation-states]{.underline}**, each with its own sacred identity and
traditions. Based on mutual respect for these differing identities, all
nation-states could cooperate and trade peacefully with one another.
Hungary will be Hungarian, Turkey will be Turkish, Israel will be
Israeli, and everyone will know who they are and what is their proper
place in the world. It will be a world without immigration, without
universal values, without multiculturalism, and without a global
elite---but with peaceful international relations and some trade. In a
word, **[the "Nationalist International" envisions the world as a
network of walled-but-friendly fortresses]{.underline}**.

Many people would think this is quite a reasonable vision. Why isn't it
a viable alternative to the liberal order? Two things should be noted
about it. First, it is still a comparatively liberal vision. It assumes
that no human group is superior to all others, that no nation should
dominate its peers, and that international cooperation is better than
conflict. In fact, liberalism and nationalism were originally closely
aligned with one another. The 19th century liberal nationalists, such as
Giuseppe Garibaldi and Giuseppe Mazzini in Italy, and Adam Mickiewicz in
Poland, dreamt about precisely such an international liberal order of
peacefully-coexisting nations.

The second thing to note about **[this vision of friendly
fortresses]{.underline}** is that it **[has been
tried]{.underline}**---**[and it failed spectacularly. All attempts to
divide the world into clear-cut nations have]{.underline}** so far
**[[resulted in war]{.mark} and genocide]{.underline}**. When the heirs
of Garibaldi, Mazzini and Mickiewicz managed to overthrow the
multi-ethnic Habsburg Empire, it proved impossible to find a clear line
dividing Italians from Slovenes or Poles from Ukrainians.

This had set the stage for the second world war. The key problem with
the network of fortresses is that each national fortress wants a bit
more land, security and prosperity for itself at the expense of the
neighbors, and without the help of universal values and global
organisations, rival fortresses cannot agree on any common rules. Walled
fortresses are seldom friendly.

But if you happen to live inside a particularly strong fortress, such as
America or Russia, why should you care? Some nationalists indeed adopt a
more extreme isolationist position. They don't believe in either a
global empire or in a global network of fortresses. Instead, **[they
deny the necessity of any global order whatsoever]{.underline}**. "Our
fortress should just raise the drawbridges," they say, "and the rest of
the world can go to hell. We should refuse entry to foreign people,
foreign ideas and foreign goods, and as long as our walls are stout and
the guards are loyal, who cares what happens to the foreigners?"

Such extreme isolationism, however, is completely divorced from economic
realities. Without a global trade network, all existing national
economies will collapse---including that of North Korea. Many countries
will not be able even to feed themselves without imports, and prices of
almost all products will skyrocket. The made-in-China shirt I am wearing
cost me about \$5. If it had been produced by Israeli workers from
Israeli-grown cotton using Israeli-made machines powered by non-existing
Israeli oil, it may well have cost ten times as much. Nationalist
leaders from Donald Trump to Vladimir Putin may therefore heap abuse on
the global trade network, but none thinks seriously of taking their
country completely out of that network. And we cannot have a global
trade network without some global order that sets the rules of the game.

Even more importantly, whether people like it or not,
**[[humankind]{.underline}]{.mark}** today
**[[faces]{.underline}]{.mark}** three **[common [problems]{.mark} that
make a mockery of all national borders]{.underline}**, and **[that can
[only]{.mark} be [solved through]{.mark} global [cooperation]{.mark}.
These are [nuclear war, climate change and tech]{.mark}nological
disruption. You cannot build a wall against nuclear winter or against
global warming, and no nation can regulate]{.underline}** artificial
intelligence (**[AI) or bioengineering single-handedly]{.underline}**.
It won't be enough if only the European Union forbids producing killer
robots or only America bans genetically-engineering human babies. Due to
the immense potential of such disruptive technologies, if even one
country decides to pursue these high-risk high-gain paths, other
countries will be forced to follow its dangerous lead for fear of being
left behind.

**[[An AI]{.mark} arms race [or]{.mark} a [biotech]{.mark}nological
[arms race]{.mark}]{.underline}** almost **[[guarantees]{.mark} the
worst outcome. Whoever wins]{.underline}** the arms race, **[the loser
will likely be [humanity]{.mark} itself]{.underline}**. For in an arms
race, **[all regulations [will collapse]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Consider, for example, conducting genetic-engineering experiments on
human babies. Every country will say: "We don't want to conduct such
experiments---we are the good guys. But how do we know our rivals are
not doing it? We cannot afford to remain behind. So we must do it before
them."

Similarly, **[consider developing autonomous-weapon
systems]{.underline}**, that can decide for themselves whether to shoot
and kill people. Again, **[every country will say: "This]{.underline}**
is a very dangerous technology, and it **[should be
regulated]{.underline}** carefully. **[But we don't trust our rivals to
regulate it, so we must develop it first]{.underline}**".

**[The only thing that can prevent]{.underline}** such **[destructive
arms races is [greater trust]{.mark} between countries. This [is
not]{.mark} an [impossible]{.mark} mission]{.underline}**. If today the
Germans promise the French: "Trust us, we aren't developing killer
robots in a secret laboratory under the Bavarian Alps," the French are
likely to believe the Germans, despite the terrible history of these two
countries. **[We need to build such trust globally]{.underline}**. We
need to reach a point when Americans and Chinese can trust one another
like the French and Germans.

Similarly, we need to create a global safety-net to protect humans
against the economic shocks that AI is likely to cause. Automation will
create immense new wealth in high-tech hubs such as Silicon Valley,
while the worst effects will be felt in developing countries whose
economies depend on cheap manual labor. There will be more jobs to
software engineers in California, but fewer jobs to Mexican factory
workers and truck drivers. We now have a global economy, but politics is
still very national. **[Unless we find solutions on a global level to
the disruptions caused by AI, entire countries might collapse, and the
resulting chaos]{.underline}**, violence and waves of immigration
**[will destabilise the entire world]{.underline}**.

This is the proper perspective to look at recent developments such as
Brexit. In itself, Brexit isn't necessarily a bad idea. But is this what
Britain and the EU should be dealing with right now? How does Brexit
help prevent nuclear war? How does Brexit help prevent climate change?
How does Brexit help regulate artificial intelligence and
bioengineering? Instead of helping, Brexit makes it harder to solve all
of these problems. Every minute that Britain and the EU spend on Brexit
is one less minute they spend on preventing climate change and on
regulating AI.

In order **[[to survive]{.underline}]{.mark}** and flourish **[in the
21st century, [humankind needs]{.mark} effective global
[cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and so far **[[the only]{.mark}
viable [blueprint]{.mark} for such cooperation [is]{.mark} offered by
[liberalism]{.mark}. Nevertheless, governments all over the world are
undermining the foundations of the liberal order]{.underline}**, and the
world is turning into a network of fortresses. **[The first to feel the
impact are the weakest members of humanity]{.underline}**, who find
themselves without any fortress willing to protect them: refugees,
illegal migrants, persecuted minorities. **[But if the walls keep
rising]{.underline}**, eventually **[the whole of humankind will feel
the squeeze]{.underline}**.

**[RUSSIAN MILITARY AND ECONOMIC INTERESTS IN THE ARCTIC]{.underline}**

**[[Russia has three]{.mark} key military [interests in the
Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Foremost is **[[securing]{.mark} the
[second-strike capability of its]{.mark} ballistic missile submarine
([SSBN) force on the Kola Peninsula]{.mark}---home to seven of the
Russian Navy's eleven ballistic missile submarines]{.underline}**---in a
conflict with NATO.8 **[Concerns about the [security of these
assets]{.mark} largely acc[ount for Russia's efforts to improve
its]{.mark} anti-access/area-denial \[[A2/AD\] systems]{.mark} and
monitoring and surveillance capabilities]{.underline}**, the increasing
tempo of strategic exercises and patrols of long-range bombers and
**[anti-submarine warfare ([ASW]{.mark}) aircraft, [and]{.mark} the
[upgrading of]{.mark} military [infrastructure]{.mark} to support these
operations.]{.underline}**9

A **[[second]{.underline}]{.mark}**, partly related, interest is
**[[protecting]{.mark} Russia's [ability to operate in the North
Atlantic]{.mark} and the European Arctic [in the event of a conflict
with NATO]{.mark}. Unlike Russia's other fleets, the [Northern Fleet has
direct access to the Barents]{.mark} and [Norwegian]{.mark} Seas
[and]{.mark} the [Atlantic Ocean]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Its **[ability
to operate]{.underline}** there **[could be [critical in]{.mark}
determining [the outcome of a conflict]{.mark} on NATO's eastern
flank.]{.underline}**10

A **[[third]{.mark} interest is [military protection for]{.mark}
Russia's growing [economic development]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
investments, and commercial interests **[in the Arctic. The vastness of
the region]{.underline}**, the long and open borders whose only
protection is offered by remoteness and inhospitable climate, the
**[poor communications systems and infrastructure]{.underline}**, the
**[overall harsh environmental conditions]{.underline}**, and **[growing
civilian activities]{.underline}** there **[increase the risk of
maritime shipping, nuclear, and environmental
accidents]{.underline}**---and **[thus the need to be able to rapidly
deploy military-response capabilities.]{.underline}**

**[Russia's [peacetime]{.mark} military [presence in the Arctic]{.mark}
and the allocation of resources to improve its military capabilities and
infrastructure there are [aligned with these
interests]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Maintaining a predominant **[military
position in the Arctic]{.underline}** is seen as **[a necessary
component of Russia's posture there, given]{.underline}** the Kremlin's
priorities in Europe and tense relationship with the West, **[NATO's
enhanced military capabilities near the Russian border, and Western
sanctions t]{.underline}**argeted to constrain Russian energy
exploration and production activities in the Arctic.

**[[IMPLICATIONS FOR]{.mark} U.S./[NATO]{.mark} POLICY]{.underline}**

**[Mutual [accusations and warnings]{.mark} by NATO and Russia
[about]{.mark} the [threat]{.mark} they pose to each other risk becoming
[a self-fulfilling prophecy]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The situation is
**[similar to the classic "security dilemma," in which states take steps
to increase their security, prompting other states to respond with their
own security measures, thereby decreasing security for the first
state]{.underline}**.72 This is risky. The **[[commitment of NATO
members]{.mark} to each other]{.underline}** and Russia's vision of its
security requirements, which **[[emphasizes strategic depth]{.mark} and
[buffers to shield it from]{.mark} perceived [threats]{.mark} to the
homeland, [meet toe-to-toe along the]{.mark} alliance's [northern
flank.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

An **[outright [military conflict in the Arctic]{.mark} would [not be
confined to the region]{.mark} and would [prove catastrophic]{.mark} for
both sides]{.underline}**. All the **[Arctic stakeholders have an
obvious interest in avoiding such an outcome,]{.underline}** as the
**[[result of]{.mark} either a [deliberate or]{.mark} an [unintended
escalation]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The **[latter is the more likely
scenario and this risk is likely to increase as the opposing forces
continue to operate in close proximity to each other.]{.underline}**

However, **[[neither side]{.mark} has shown [will]{.mark}ingness to
[back down]{.mark}]{.underline}**. For **[NATO]{.underline}** it is a
**[matter of maintaining the credibility of its commitment to mutual
defense]{.underline}**; for **[Russia, its main adversary has advanced
to the gates of the homeland and is intent on denying the security,
geopolitical, and economic claims to which it feels
entitled]{.underline}**. The rising **[[tensions]{.underline}]{.mark}**
are **[not the result of mutual misunderstandings---both sides' actions
[are deliberate and reflect clashing interests]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

## 1AC Scenario \-\-- Black Sea

### 1AC\-\--Black Sea ADV

#### Cohesive ASW in the Black Sea is key to deter [Russian aggression]{.underline} in the region

Energy Center (ROEC). George Vișan (2018) Eurasia Daily Monitor Volume:

In the four years that have passed since Russia annexed Crimea, the
**[number of]{.underline}** **[Russian submarines active in
the]{.underline}** **[Black Sea has grown]{.underline}** from one to
seven. These submarines **[pose a]{.underline}** **[grave threat to the
security of t]{.underline}**he North Atlantic Treaty Organization's
(**[NATO]{.underline}**) eastern flank. And together with the Kremlin's
military buildup on the occupied peninsula, they have **[shifted the
balance of forces in the region in Russia's favor.]{.underline}**

Immediately after the annexation of Crimea, **[Russia embarked
on]{.underline}** an **[ambitious program of modernizing its Black Sea
Fleet]{.underline}**, based out of Sevastopol. Originally, six Admiral
Grigorovich--class (Project 11356P/M) guided-missile frigates and six
Kilo-class submarines were to be constructed and deployed in the Black
Sea (Interfax, May 13, 2014). Both frigates and submarines are capable
of launching Kalibr land-attack cruise missiles with a range of over
2,000 kilometers. However, the ongoing war in eastern Ukraine has
delayed the building of the Admiral Grigorovich frigates as Kyiv stopped
supplying Russian defense contractors with the gas turbines necessary to
power them (see EDM, January 25, 2017; The Moscow Times, June 8, 2015).
Presently, only three ships have been commissioned.

Nevertheless, all six of the Kilo-class submarines have been delivered
and commissioned. Furthermore, four of these submarines have fired their
cruise missiles in anger in support of the Russian intervention in Syria
(the Rostov-na-Donu, Krasnodar, Veliky Novgorod and Kolpino). In
operational terms, this means that their crews are battle-tested and
have a high degree of confidence in their boats and weapons systems.

A veteran of the Cold War, the Kilo diesel-electric attack submarine
remains a potent weapons system to this day. It is one of the quietest
conventional submarines in service and one of the safest. In the
confines of the Black Sea and of the Eastern Mediterranean, these
submarines can strike targets with torpedoes and cruise missiles with
relative ease, while being protected by Russia's burgeoning anti-access
and area denial (A2/AD) "bubbles" (ROEC, July 14, 2015). Their
**[capability to launch Kalibr cruise missiles]{.underline}** **[makes
them extremely dangerous]{.underline}**, being **[able to hit targets
well inside the Black Sea region]{.underline}**, as well as in Europe,
Central Asia and the Middle East. As such, the Kilo **[submarine is an
A2/AD asset]{.underline}** **[as well as an]{.underline}** **[offensive
power projection platform,]{.underline}** **[capable of hitting NATO
facilities]{.underline}** in Central and Eastern Europe or to threaten
the Deveselu missile defense base in Romania (see EDM, February 16,
2017; September 19, 2017).

Among NATO members in the Black Sea, region only
**[Turkey]{.underline}** has fully developed anti-submarine warfare
(ASW) capabilities and can meet the challenge posed by Russian undersea
vessels. Furthermore, Turkey's control over the Bosporus and Dardanelles
Straits allows for easy monitoring of transiting Russian submarines.
However, Ankara's ASW **[capabilities]{.underline}** **[are divided
between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean Sea]{.underline}** **[and
its readiness is being put to the test by Russia's
assertiveness.]{.underline}** Romania and Bulgaria, the other two NATO
members in the region that possess navies, are struggling to offer up
any kind of effective response.

For NATO**[, the writing is on the wall]{.underline}**---it **[needs to
increase its ASW capabilities fast]{.underline}** **[in order to
deter]{.underline}** **[the Russian submarine threat.]{.underline}** As
part of the European Reassurance Initiative (ERI) US P-8 Poseidon
aircraft have begun patrolling over the Black Sea in order to track
these submarines and gather intelligence. Nevertheless, the presence of
Russian fighter aircraft as well as sophisticated air defense systems in
and around Crimea makes the P-8s vulnerable to interception and/or
interference (România Liberă, September 9, 2017). Clearly, besides a
stronger Alliance presence in the region, **[there needs to be an
overall increase in regional ASW capabilities.]{.underline}**

An obvious response to the Russian submarine threat in the Black Sea is
increasing Romania's and Bulgaria's naval capabilities. Romanian and
Bulgarian navies operate old ships equipped mostly with outdated Russian
sensors and weapons systems. Both countries have not acquired military
vessels since joining the North Atlantic Alliance, mostly due to
economic reasons. Nevertheless, the Russian military buildup in Crimea
has created a sense of urgency concerning naval capabilities for
Bucharest and Sofia.

In 2017, Bulgaria announced plans to acquire two multi-role corvettes
(Defense News, August 29, 2017), in effect reviving a program dating
back to 2007 (Novinite, October 2007). Romania is also preparing to
acquire multi-role corvettes, which it views as the single most
effective type of surface combatant for littoral areas (MApN.ro,
December 8, 2017). Bucharest is likely to purchase four such vessels in
a program that will span seven years and is estimated to be worth \$1.9
billion. Furthermore, the Romanian Navy plans to modernize its vintage
Type 22 frigates, acquired from the United Kingdom in 2003, using the
offset agreement from the corvette purchase (MApN.ro, December 8, 2017).
A decision concerning the corvette program is expected in 2018. Plans
have also been drawn up to buy submarines; but such an acquisition
process may not begin until sometime between 2020 and 2026 (Agerpres,
January 26, 2017).

Besides looking to obtain new ships for their aging fleets, Romania and
Bulgaria have been involved, since 2014, in numerous US- and NATO-led
naval exercises in the Black Sea and the Mediterranean. Exercises like
Sea Breeze 2017 (C6f.navy.mil, July 25, 2017) have included not only a
large number of NATO allies, but also Ukraine and Georgia, targets of
Russian aggression. Increasing the number of NATO joint exercises in the
Black Sea sends a clear deterrence signal to Moscow, while also
increasing capabilities and readiness at a fraction of the cost of new
military acquisitions.

**[In the short term]{.underline}**, it seems that **[Russia has the
upper hand in the Black Sea region]{.underline}** **[due to its
fast-paced rearmament drive]{.underline}** and sophisticated A2/AD
assets. However, **[NATO can overcome this threat by developing regional
capabilities]{.underline}** **[designed to thwart
apparen]{.underline}**t **[Russian advantages.]{.underline}** Smart
defense investments in critical capabilities, such as ASW, combined with
complex joint exercises **[can restore the regional military balance in
favor of the Alliance.]{.underline}**

#### Deterrence breakdown ensures escalating [conflicts there]{.underline} and [in Syria]{.underline}

Next, **[[NATO's presence in the Baltics]{.underline}]{.mark}** and
Poland **[[is]{.mark} the right size]{.underline}**: **[[large enough
to]{.mark} present a credible [deter]{.mark}rent to [Russia, but
not]{.mark} large enough to [present an offensive]{.mark} military
[threat]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[NATO was right to beef up]{.mark}
its [presence]{.mark} in the Baltics after 2014]{.underline}**. After
all, the three tiny Alliance members are simply incapable of defending
themselves alone in the unlikely event of war with Russia. But deploying
seven full brigades totaling 40,000 to 50,000 troops, as some analysts
suggest, would be destabilizing. Russia would doubtless perceive this
deployment as an offensive threat and increase its forces in response.
The four NATO battle groups currently deployed -- one each to the three
Baltic republics and Poland -- are important for their composition as
much as their size. These 5,000-plus troops could do no more than delay
a Russian incursion while NATO deployed reinforcements. But the fact
that 24 of the 30 NATO members contribute forces to the Alliance's
"Enhanced Forward Presence" mission makes it clear to Russia that NATO
is united in its determination to defend the Baltics, and that war there
means war with nearly all of NATO.

Lastly, **[[there is no indication]{.mark} that [Moscow has any
intention of invading the Baltics]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[Russia has
always seen the Baltics as different]{.underline}** from the rest of the
former Soviet Union. In short, when the Kremlin looks at Estonia,
Latvia, and Lithuania **[[it sees]{.mark}
[Europe]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[and it had always played by different
rules in Europe than in its self-designated "near
abroad"]{.underline}**. Anatol Lieven remarked on this Russian tendency
in his book The Baltic Revolution: "A large proportion of Baltic
Russians have been prepared to acknowledge that the Balts have a
superior civic culture, are cleaner, more orderly and harder working.
They may qualify this by saying that Russian life is 'friendlier', or
'more humane', but this is the exact reverse of the usual colonizer:
colonized self-images."

**[[Russia]{.mark}'s behavior toward the Baltic States immediately after
the collapse of the Soviet Union made clear the extent to which it
treats them differently. As it was intervening on behalf of separatist
movements in Georgia and Moldova, it [scrupulously avoided
escalating]{.mark} the situation with the Russian-speaking minorities in
Latvia and Estonia]{.underline}**. Despite the fact that Moscow was
exceptionally unhappy with the treatment of Russians speakers there, and
had military forces deployed to both countries until 1994, it always
expressed its grievances through official, institutional channels
instead of trying to rally the Russian-speaking minorities to violence
or intervening directly as it did elsewhere.

**[[Rather than]{.mark} fixate on [the Baltics]{.mark}, where the threat
is low and a deterrent force is in place]{.underline}**, **[[NATO should
pay]{.underline}]{.mark}** more **[[attention to the Black Sea]{.mark}
region. [It is here that Russia has already intervened]{.mark}
militarily, [and is attempting to fracture the Alliance and erode
confidence in its commitments]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [**[The Black
Sea]{.mark}** region also [serves as the hub for Russia's recent
expansion into]{.mark} the Eastern Mediterranean and is critical to its
efforts to support its intervention in [Syria]{.mark}]{.underline}.

There are four main reasons the Black Sea region demands more attention.

First, three of the six littoral states -- Romania, Bulgaria, and Turkey
-- are NATO members and two -- [**[Ukraine and Georgia]{.underline}** --
**[were]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[[promised membership]{.mark} in
2008]{.underline}**. [[Whether the Alliance should have
committed]{.mark} to membership for Ukraine and Georgia [is no longer
relevant; **it made the commitment and routinely reiterates it**]{.mark}
**at NATO summits**]{.underline}. **[[Every year that]{.mark} the fear
of Russia's reaction [delays]{.mark} progress on [bringing]{.mark} Kyiv
and Tbilisi [into NATO erodes confidence in NATO's other
commitments]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

Next, an examination of Russian military activities in the last
decade-plus leads to the conclusion that **[the Black Sea and Eastern
Mediterranean is the area of greatest geopolitical importance for
Russia]{.underline}**. [All of [its military interventions in]{.mark}
this period]{.underline} -- **[[Georgia, Ukraine and
Syria]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- [have [occurred in this region]{.mark},
and **[Moscow]{.mark} clearly [intends to challenge the]{.mark} [West in
this part of the world. NATO provides the best vehicle to meet this
challenge]{.mark}**]{.underline} and protect the important national
interests Western states have in this region.

Conclusion

These three **[[conflict scenarios are plausible]{.mark} risks [for the
Black ]{.mark}]{.underline}**Sea in 2020. Looking at "the wider Black
Sea area" over a medium-term perspective, a more complex array of
challenges is visible. In the Western Balkans, proposed land swaps and
**[[France's veto]{.mark} [against]{.mark} the European Union
[expansion]{.mark} add tension to a vulnerable region at the heart of
Europe]{.underline}**. To the south, Turkey's divergence from other NATO
members **[[and]{.underline}]{.mark}** the development of **[[Russia's
offensive military capability]{.mark} development]{.underline}** and
projection into the Mediterranean **[[add fuel to the
fire]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Along Turkey's southern border, **[[Iraq
and Syria will be consumed]{.mark} by humanitarian
tragedies.]{.underline}** Finally, looking east, **[China's
[B]{.mark}elt and [R]{.mark}oad [I]{.mark}nitiative [is
expanding]{.mark} Beijing's influence in the Black Sea]{.underline}**
and into Europe more broadly. **[[Increased]{.mark} security and
[stability in the Black Sea will be essential.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**[To prevent further conflict, [American]{.mark} and]{.underline}**
European **[[policymakers should prioritize the Black Sea]{.mark} as [a
security region]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} At a minimum, sanctions
against Russia should be maintained. The West should support Ukraine's
and Georgia's sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as their
Western path. To prevent China's buying up of the region, Western powers
should consider offering infrastructure investment opportunities as
alternatives to a poor and underdeveloped region while ensuring
visibility with regard to regional public opinion. Lastly, in the NATO
framework, pressure should be exerted to prevent Turkey from acting
against collective interests.

#### Additional Russian incursions into Syria cause Russia-Israel war, which draws in the US and causes great power nuclear war 

**Peck 19** \[Michael Peck, "A Nuclear Nightmare: How a War Between
Russia and Israel Could Start," Nov 16, 2019,
https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/nuclear-nightmare-how-war-between-russia-and-israel-could-start-96861\]

**[The potential for war is real]{.underline}**.

Key point: In the end, **[either Israel or Russia will have to back
down]{.underline}**.

Could Israeli air strikes in Syria trigger war between Israel and
Russia?

Israel remains determined to continue pounding Iranian forces in Syria
in a bid to keep Tehran's forces away from Israel's northern border. At
the same time, **[Russia]{.underline}** has thousands of troops in Syria
that **[could]{.underline}** be caught in the crossfire---or even
**[become belligerents if Moscow tires of its Syrian ally being
pummeled.]{.underline}**

And **[if Israel and Russia come to blows]{.underline}**, **[would
Israel's big brother---the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates---**[feel compelled to
intervene?]{.underline}**

Not that Jerusalem or Moscow are eager for such a fight. "Neither of us
desire a military confrontation," a senior Israel Defense Forces (IDF)
official told me during a recent interview in Jerusalem. "It would be
detrimental to both sides."

Yet **[Israel]{.underline}**'s policy boils down to this: it **[will do
whatever it sees as necessary to eject Iranian forces from
Syria]{.underline}**. **[And if Russia doesn't like it, then that's just
the price of ensuring that Syria doesn't become another Iranian rocket
base on Israel's border.]{.underline}**

Relations between Jerusalem and Moscow are far warmer than during the
Cold War. The result is a strange embrace reminiscent of the U.S.-Soviet
detente of the 1970s. On the surface, a certain friendliness and desire
for cooperation. Yet beneath the smiles is wariness, suspicion and a
clash of fundamental interests.

"**[No one in Israel]{.underline}** is confused about who the Russians
are and who they are aligned with," **[said the IDF]{.underline}**
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "**[The Russians are not
our allies, to put it mildly.]{.underline}** We have one ally, and that
is the United States. **[The Russians are]{.underline}** here for
totally different objectives. They are **[supporting a regime \[Syria\]
that has an outspoken goal of annihilating Israel]{.underline}** if it
only could. They are also part of a coalition that supports Iran."

Just how easily Israeli military operations can trigger an incident
became evident during a September 2018 strike on ammunition depots in
western Syria. Anti-aircraft missiles launched by Syrian gunners
accidentally shot down a Russian Il-20 surveillance aircraft, killing
fifteen people. Israel denies Russian accusations that it deliberately
used the Russian plane as cover, or failed to give Moscow sufficient
warning of the raid. Yet Russia still blamed Israel for the mishap and
retaliated by supplying advanced S-300 anti-aircraft missiles to Syria.

Nonetheless, Israel sees value in Russia as a potential restraint on
Iran, and a possible lever to get Iranian forces out of Syria. After a
February meeting between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President
Vladimir Putin to mend fences after the Il-20 incident, Israeli
officials claimed Putin had agreed that foreign forces should withdraw
from Syria. For Moscow, friendly relations with Israel offer more
influence in the Middle East even as America may be scaling down its
presence in the region.

Still, the Kremlin has denounced Israeli strikes in Syria as
"illegitimate." Syria has been a Russian ally for more than fifty years,
and it was Russian air strikes---along with Iranian and Hezbollah
troops---that saved Syrian president Bashar al-Assad's faltering regime
from ISIS and other rebel groups. At least 63,000 Russian troops have
served in Syria since 2015. Though Putin has promised since 2016 that
Russian forces would withdraw, Russia currently retains more than 5,000
troops and private military contractors in Syria, backed by several
dozen aircraft and helicopters.

And Russia is in Syria to stay. The Syrian port of Tartus is Russia's
only naval base in the Mediterranean: in 2016, Moscow and Damascus
signed a forty-nine-year agreement that allows nuclear-powered Russian
warships to operate from there. In addition, Russian aircraft and
surface-to-air missiles, including the long-range S-400 air defense
system, operate from at least two air bases in western Syria.

**[Israel can live with the Russians next door---but not the
Iranians]{.underline}**. Israeli officials warn of Tehran's plan to
station 100,000 Iranian and allied troops in Syria.
**[Hezbollah]{.underline}**, with its estimated arsenal of 130,000-plus
rockets, already **[menaces Israel's Lebanon frontier]{.underline}**.
**[Syria joining Lebanon]{.underline}** **[as a second Iranian rocket
base is the stuff of Israeli nightmares]{.underline}**.

"We can -- and we intend to -- make it as difficult as possible and
inflict a price tag that the Iranians aren't willing to pay," the IDF
official said. And the Israeli Air Force has been just doing that,
attacking "Iranian and Hezbollah targets hundreds of times," Netanyahu
announced after a devastating attack on Iranian arms depots near
Damascus International Airport in January.

"**[We continue to implement our plans]{.underline}**," the IDF official
replied when asked if Russia would deter Israeli raids into Syria. "Our
activities suggest that, despite everything, we enjoy significant
freedom of action."

But more telling was his one-word response when asked how willing is
Israel to fight for that freedom of action.

"Willing."

Which leaves the question: **[Can Israel target Iran in Syria without
triggering a clash with Russia]{.underline}**?

There are deconfliction mechanisms in place, including a hotline between
the Israeli and Russian militaries. "We are very strict about informing
the Russians about our activities and that their operational picture is
up to date," said the IDF official. Yet those procedures were not
sufficient to avoid a downing of a Russian plane.

Perhaps that ill-fated Il-20 was just at the wrong place at the wrong
time. Still, **[it is not hard to imagine a multiplicity of equally
fatal scenarios]{.underline}**. Russian **[advisers]{.underline}** or
technicians **[caught in an Israeli raid]{.underline}** on an Iranian or
Syrian installation. **[An errant Israeli smart bomb]{.underline}** that
**[hits a Russian base]{.underline}**, or a Russian pilot or
anti-aircraft battery spooked by a nearby Israeli raid into opening
fire. Or, **[perhaps Russia will just feel obligated to support the
prestige of its Syrian ally]{.underline}** and its shaky government.
Just how incendiary Syrian skies are for everyone became evident in
December 2017, when U.S. F-22 fighters fired flares to warn off two
Russian Su-25 attack jets that breached a no-go zone in eastern Syria.

To be clear, the IDF is neither boastful nor belligerent about its
capabilities versus Russia, a former superpower with the largest nuclear
arsenal on the planet. The IDF official likened Israel to "The Mouse
that Roared," the classic novel of a tiny nation that challenges the
United States.

But if **[Israel]{.underline}** resembles any mouse,
it**['s]{.underline}** Mighty Mouse: small, **[powerful and not afraid
to use its fists]{.underline}**. In fact, what makes a potential
**[Israel-Russia battle]{.underline}** so dangerous is that it **[is not
hypothetical]{.underline}**. **[After]{.underline}** the 1967 Six-Day
War, Soviet fighters were sent to Egypt. This led to a notorious July
**[1970]{.underline}** incident when in a well-planned aerial ambush
over the Suez Canal, **[Israeli fighters shot down five
Soviet]{.underline}**-piloted MiG-21 **[jets]{.underline}** in three
minutes.

On the other hand, Russia doesn't need to fight Israel to hurt Israel.
Indeed, the IDF official seemed less concerned about a physical clash
between Israeli and Russian forces, and more concerned that Russia could
choose to supply advanced weapons---such as anti-aircraft missiles---to
Israeli enemies such as Syria and Iran. In the early 1970s, the Soviet
Union supplied numerous air defense missiles and guns to Egypt and
Syria, which inflicted heavy losses on Israeli planes in the 1973
October War. If it wants to, Russia can make Israeli air operations very
expensive.

As always with the Arab-Israeli (or Iranian-Israeli) conflict, **[the
real danger]{.underline}** isn't the regional conflict, but **[how it
might escalate]{.underline}**. In the 1973 war, **[the Soviets
threatened]{.underline}** to send troops to Egypt unless Israel agreed
to a cease-fire. **[The United States responded by going on nuclear
alert.]{.underline}**

**[Were the Israelis and Russians to come to blows]{.underline}**, or if
Moscow were to seriously threaten military force against Israel,
**[could the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[risk a
grave loss of prestige by not intervening to back its longtime
ally]{.underline}**? **[Could Russia---whose Syrian intervention is a
proud symbol of its reborn military muscle and great power
status]{.underline}**---**[not retaliate]{.underline}** for another
downed Russian plane or a dead Russian soldier?

Which leads to the ultimate question: **[could tensions between Israel
and Russia lead to a clash between American and Russian
troops]{.underline}**?

In the end, **[somebody will have to back down]{.underline}**. **[But
Iran isn't about to]{.underline}** give up its outpost on Israel's
border, and **[Russia]{.underline}** probably **[can't]{.underline}**
force them to. **[Then there is Israel]{.underline}**, which is grimly
determined to stop Iran.

As the IDF official said, "We have proven over more than 70 years as a
sovereign state that you don't push us around."

#### NATO Cohesion is key to solve

\-- Iowa

**[What practical steps can NATO take]{.underline}** towards this end?
First, **[it should recognize the strategic significance of the Black
Sea region and eliminate the existing "tiered" forward presence, which
includes "enhanced Forward Presence" in the Baltic Sea region and
"tailored Forward Presence" in the Black Sea region. Next, NATO members
should improve situational awareness and prepare for rapid political and
military responses to Kremlin provocations along the entire eastern
flank. Third, allies need to upgrade air and missile capabilities and
improve security cooperation programs, procedures, and personnel
assignments. And finally, NATO should support NATO partners in the Black
Sea region --- Ukraine and Georgia --- while increasing investment in
their economic development]{.underline}**.

The Strategic Setting

**[In response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2014, NATO created an
asymmetrical defense posture along its eastern flank. It prioritized the
defense of the Baltic Sea region and the Baltic states --- Estonia,
Latvia, and Lithuania --- which the alliance considered most vulnerable
to Russian pressure]{.underline}**. This included deploying enhanced
Forward Presence battle groups, bolstering Baltic air policing,
increasing military readiness and exercises, improving integrated air
and missile defense and long-range fires, and establishing an array of
mission command and control headquarters. NATO continues to prioritize
the region.

**[[In the Black Sea Region, on the other hand, the alliance]{.mark}
settled for tailored Forward Presence and [took a more ad hoc
approach]{.mark} to improving mission command, regional air policing,
and exercises]{.underline}**. It strengthened coastal radar systems and
slowly established new land force headquarters. The United States
expanded its capabilities at Mihail Kogălniceanu air base by bringing
Aegis Ashore ballistic missile defenses online in Romania. Bulgaria and
Romania are also modernizing their air forces. The U.S. and allied naval
presence has increased in the Black Sea, but must operate within the
parameters of the 1936 Montreux Convention, which recognizes Turkish
sovereignty over the Bosporus Straits, grants Ankara the authority to
restrict military access, and prevents non-littoral countries from
possessing a permanent naval presence in the region.

**[[NATO's asymmetrical eastern flank deterrence]{.mark} --- enhanced
Forward Presence versus tailored Forward Presence --- [has created
gaps]{.mark} and seams [in both the Baltic and]{.mark} the [Black Sea
regions that Moscow could]{.mark} potentially [exploit. By not
presenting a]{.mark} more [unified,]{.mark} coherent [front, the
alliance remains exposed to]{.mark} Moscow's military [probing,]{.mark}
subversion, disinformation, [cyberattacks]{.mark}, and overt diplomatic
and economic pressure.]{.underline}**

**[In contrast, Moscow views the eastern flank --- its western flank ---
more coherently than NATO, and employs a long-term strategy aimed to
restore a sphere of influence in Central and Eastern Europe. In the
Baltic Sea region, the Kremlin has modernized its forces in the Western
Military District, transformed the Kaliningrad exclave into a potential
platform for limited ground invasions or attacks against NATO members,
emplaced cutting-edge mobile short-range Iskander-M missiles and S-400
air defense systems, threatened nuclear attack against allies and
partners, and conducted large exercises which are aggressive towards
Poland and the Baltic states.]{.underline}**

**[[In the Black Sea region, the Kremlin has demonstrated]{.mark} an
even greater [willingness to use force]{.mark}. This is due to NATO's
more ad hoc deterrence posture, and less formal partnerships with
regional countries compared to the Baltic Sea region. The Black Sea
region [is]{.mark} also, in many respects, [of]{.mark} even [greater
strategic value to Moscow because it is the "launching pad" for]{.mark}
destabilizing operations in Syria and naval operations in [the Eastern
Mediterranean]{.mark}. Russia has continued militarizing Crimea and its
war in eastern Ukraine, maintained the occupation of Moldovan and
Georgian territories, pursued destabilizing campaigns in the Western
Balkans and South Caucasus, and is attempting to drive a wedge between
Turkey and NATO while threatening Ankara with mass migration flows from
Idlib in Syria. Russia brazenly attacked Ukrainian navy vessels in
November 2018 --- only releasing the 24 Ukrainian sailors in September
2019 --- and holds more than 200 "hostages."]{.underline}**

**[[Effective deterrence is]{.mark} not just about a mathematical
balance of forces, but [about conveying]{.mark} to the Kremlin the
[capabilities and resolve of NATO and its partners. Any perceived
absence of cohesion and coherence --- like NATO's asymmetric approach to
the Baltic]{.mark} Sea region [and Black Sea region --- could]{.mark}
unintentionally [signal to Moscow that it can exploit]{.mark} seams
within the alliance [with impunity. This necessitates a new strategy for
the eastern flank.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Meeting the Russian Threat

**[[NATO needs a coherent]{.mark} strategy across the Baltic and Black
Sea regions with a balance of capabilities that present a united,
unassailable front against Moscow's assertiveness --- in short, taking
the [view of "one flank, one threat, one presence." The alliance can
make substantial progress towards this goal]{.mark} with the following
practical steps.]{.underline}**

### Impacts \-\-- Nuke Terror

#### Black Sea instability causes terrorist nuclear acquisition \-\-- it's the heart of the global nuclear black market 

**Meakins 17** \[Joss Meakins, "Trafficking in Destruction: Nuclear
Smuggling in the Black Sea Region," 5 September, 2017,
<https://shoc.rusi.org/informer/trafficking-destruction-nuclear-smuggling-black-sea-region>\]

Nuclear terrorism is a severe and credible threat. In July, the
Washington Post reported that Daesh (also known as the Islamic State of
Iraq and Syria, ISIS) had almost 'stumbled on the ingredients for a
dirty bomb.'

Today, **[the Black Sea region is the heart of the world's nuclear black
market]{.underline}**. **[Russia retains the world's largest nuclear
stockpile]{.underline}**, which is dispersed across hundreds of
sites**[, many poorly guarded due to corruption and political
instability]{.underline}**. While Russia is likely the primary source
for black-market radiological material, **[former Soviet countries
between Russia and the Black Sea similarly possess weakly guarded
nuclear]{.underline}** and radiological **[materials]{.underline}**. In
theory, **[these materials can easily be transported by]{.underline}**
land or via **[Black Sea ports]{.underline}** to actors that seek to use
it, including non-state actors in Turkey, Iraq or Syria.

Understandably, the most widely analysed worst-case scenario concerning
nuclear terrorism has primarily focused on terrorists detonating a
nuclear bomb. Although this is a terrifying possibility, it remains
extremely difficult to manufacture or steal a nuclear weapon.

Indeed, producing weapons-usable, 'highly-enriched' uranium (HEU) -- at
least 20% U-235 and probably much higher -- or plutonium is almost
certainly beyond the ability of most terrorist groups. The enrichment
process is highly technical and expensive, and plutonium can only be
created inside a nuclear reactor. Similarly, nuclear weapons and
weapons-usable materials are (comparatively) tightly guarded, mostly in
high-security military installations.

**[It would be considerably easier for a terrorist group to
create]{.underline}** and use a dirty bomb or 'radiological dispersion
device' (**[RDD]{.underline}**), which would spread dangerous
radioactive substances over a large area. The potential threat posed by
an RDD is clearly demonstrated by a radioactive contamination incident
in the Brazilian city of Goiânia in 1987. Here, scavengers in a
scrapyard deliberately broke open the radioactive capsule inside an
abandoned teletherapy unit, containing an isotope of caesium-137.

The men distributed the curious glowing material as a gift to friends
and family, contaminating 249 people and killing four. The incident
caused \$36 million in damage and produced three football fields of
radioactive waste. 112,000 people sought medical attention, fearing that
they had been contaminated. An RDD could provoke a similar reaction,
overwhelming hospitals and causing a breakdown in public health
services. In Goiânia, contaminated soil or buildings had to be removed
wholesale; a similar clean-up operation in central London, for example,
could necessitate the demolition or abandonment of part of the city.

Although only a handful of radioactive substances are suitable to create
a RDD, many of these are widely available, being used in hospitals,
universities, mines and other civilian sites. From 1993--2014, 1,150
incidents of theft or loss of radiological materials were reported to
the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), many of which could be
used in an RDD.

Caesium-137, a radioactive powder, is of particular concern because it
is dispersible, water soluble and can be made into an aerosol spray.
**[Those seeking to use it for destructive purposes might]{.underline}**
not use a dirty bomb, but rather **[contaminate the water
supply]{.underline}** or target an enclosed space such as a subway
system. With no tell-tale explosion, it could take hours for the
attack's source or the attack itself to be discovered.

Worryingly, **[there is a well-documented trade in dirty-bomb
ingredients in the Black Sea region.]{.underline}** Large ports such as
Batumi and Odessa and frozen conflict zones such as Abkhazia, South
Ossetia and Transnistria are known as hotspots for radiological (and
indeed nuclear) trafficking. In these locations, **[criminal syndicates
exploit the endemic corruption present]{.underline}**, while
**[utilising]{.underline}** **[existing]{.underline}** human, drugs and
weapons **[trafficking routes to smuggle radioactive
materials.]{.underline}**

In particular, Georgia and Armenia have seen several notable cases in
recent years.

In 2003, Garik Dadayan, an Armenian, was sentenced to jail but served
only 2.5 years for trying to smuggle 200 g of weapons-grade uranium into
Georgia. In 2010, Dadayan supplied weapons-grade uranium to two
smugglers who thought they were selling a sample to Islamic terrorists.

In 2012, three men were arrested in Batumi for trying to sell
caesium-137, while in 2014, two Armenians were apprehended trying to
smuggle caesium-137 into Georgia.

In January 2016, three Georgians were arrested for attempting to sell
Caesium-137 to undercover police, while in April 2016, six people were
arrested for attempting to sell Uranium in Tbilisi.

Moldova is another important node in the radiological and nuclear
smuggling network. In 2011, investigations in Moldova uncovered a deal
to sell bomb-grade uranium to a buyer in Sudan. The seller ranted about
his hatred of America and claimed to have 10 kg of uranium and access to
plutonium. The deal was orchestrated by a Russian-Ukrainian citizen
known as the 'the Colonel' who lived in Transnistria and was found to
have paid a corrupt policeman to transport the materials.

Since 2015, meanwhile, Russian crime groups have made four known
attempts to sell illegal radioactive materials in the country. Again in
2015, two Moldovans were arrested for trying to sell Caesium-135. The
dealer was revealed to have claimed that ISIS could potentially use the
substance to make a dirty bomb. The supplier was supposedly a Russian
FSB officer who had access to more dangerous material, but when the
arrests were made, the supplier vanished.

Such examples reveal the emergence of **[an unholy alliance in the Black
Sea region between corrupt security]{.underline}** personnel, organised
crime groups and non-state buyers, **[spawned by corruption, poverty and
weak rule of law.]{.underline}** In the words of one Moldovan
investigator, 'as long as the smugglers think they can make big money
without getting caught, they will keep doing it'.

#### Nuclear terrorism causes extinction 

**Hayes 18** \[Peter Hayes, Director of the Nautilus Institute and
Honorary Professor at the Centre for International Security Studies at
the University of Sydney, January 18, 2018. "NON-STATE TERRORISM AND
INADVERTENT NUCLEAR WAR."
https://nautilus.org/napsnet/napsnet-special-reports/non-state-terrorism-and-inadvertent-nuclear-war\]

That is, non-state actors with nuclear weapons or threat goals and
capacities do not seek the same goals, will not use the same control
systems, and will use radically different organizational procedures and
systems to deliver on their threats compared with nuclear armed states.
If used tactically for immediate terrorist effect, a non-state nuclear
terrorist could violently attack nuclear facilities, exploiting any
number of vulnerabilities in fuel cycle facility security, or use actual
nuclear materials and even warheads against military or civilian
targets. If a persistent, strategically oriented nuclear terrorist
succeed in gaining credible nuclear threat capacities, it might take
hostage one or more states or cities. If such an event coincides with
already high levels of tension and even military collisions between the
non-nuclear forces of nuclear armed states, then
**[[a]{.underline}]{.mark}** non-state **[[nuclear terrorist
attack]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[could impel a nuclear armed
state]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[to escalate]{.underline}]{.mark}** its
threat or even **[[military actions]{.underline}]{.mark}** [**[against
other states]{.underline}**, **[in]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[the
[belief]{.mark} that [this]{.mark} targeted [state]{.mark} may have
[sponsored]{.mark} [the]{.mark} non-state
[attack]{.mark},]{.underline}** or was simply the source of the attack,
whatever the declared identity of the attacking non-state entity.
**[[This]{.underline}]{.mark}** outcome **[[could]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[[trigger]{.underline}]{.mark}** these states to go onto one or more
of the pathways to **[[inadvertent nuclear war]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
especially if the terrorist attack was on a high value and high risk
nuclear facility or involved the seizure and/or use of fissile material.
**[Some]{.underline}** experts **[dismiss this possibility
as]{.underline}** **[so remote]{.underline}** as to be not worth
worrying about. **[Yet the history]{.underline}** **[of nuclear
terrorism]{.underline}** globally and in the Northeast Asian region
**[suggests]{.underline}** **[otherwise]{.underline}**. Using the sand
castle metaphor, once built on the high tide line, sand castles may
withstand the wind but eventually succumb to the tide once it reaches
the castle---at least once, usually twice a day. Also, theories of
organizational and technological failure point to the coincidence of
multiple, relatively insignificant driving events that interact or
accumulate in ways that lead the "metasystem" to fail, even if each
individual component of a system works perfectly. Thus, the potential
catalytic effect of a nuclear terrorist incident is not that it would of
itself lead to a sudden inter-state nuclear war; but that **[[at a time
of crisis]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[when]{.underline}** **[[alert levels
are]{.mark} already [high]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[when control
systems on nuclear forces have already shifted from primary emphasis on
negative to positive control, when [decision making is]{.mark} already
[stressed]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[when [the potential
for]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[miscalc]{.underline}]{.mark}**ulation
**[[is]{.underline}]{.mark}** already **[[high]{.underline}]{.mark}**
due to shows of force indicating that first-use is nigh, when rhetorical
threats promising annihilation on the one hand, or collapse of morale
and weakness on the other invite counter-vailing threats by nuclear
adversaries or their allies to gain the upper hand in the "contest of
resolve," and when organizational cybernetics may be in play such that
purposeful actions are implemented differently than intended, then **[a
terrorist nuclear attack]{.underline}** **[may shift]{.underline}** a
coincident combination of some or all of these **[factors to a threshold
level]{.underline}** **[where they]{.underline}** collectively **[lead
to]{.underline}** **[a first-use decision]{.underline}** **[by one or
more nuclear-armed states]{.underline}**. If the terrorist attack is
timed or happens to coincide with high levels of inter-state tension
involving nuclear-armed states, then some or all of these tendencies
will likely be in play anyway---precisely the concern of those who posit
pathways to inadvertent nuclear war as outlined in section 2 above. The
critical question is, just as a catalyst breaks some bonds and lets
other bonds form, reducing the energy cost and time taken to achieve a
chemical reaction, how would a nuclear terrorist attack at time of
nuclear charged inter-state tension potentially shift the way that
nuclear threat is projected and perceived in a four or five-way
nuclear-prone conflict, and how might it affect the potential pathways
to inadvertent nuclear war in such a system? Such a pervasive
incremental effect is shown in Figure 6 below. Any one or indeed all of
these starting nuclear control profiles may be disputed, as might the
control profile at the end of the response arrow. (In Figure 6, each
nuclear state responds to a terrorist nuclear attack by loosening or
abandoning negative controls against unauthorized use, and shifts
towards reliance mostly on positive procedural controls biased towards
use). But each nuclear armed state will make its moves in response to
the posited terrorist nuclear attack partly in response to its
expectations as to how other nuclear armed states will perceive and
respond to these moves, as well as their perception that an enemy state
may have sponsored a terrorist nuclear attack---and considered together,
it is obvious that they may not share a common image of the other
states' motivations and actions in this response, leading to cumulative
potential for misinterpretation and rapid subsequent action, reaction,
and escalation. It is also conceivable---although intuitively it would
seem far less likely--that a terrorist nuclear attack at such a
conjuncture of partly or fully mobilized nuclear armed states might
induce one or more of them to stand down, slow down its decision making
or deployments, establish new communication channels with potential
nuclear enemy states, and even make common cause to hunt down and
eliminate the non-state nuclear terrorist entity, or coordinate
operations to respond to the threat of a second terrorist nuclear
attack---the credibility of which would be high in the aftermath of a
successful initial non-state nuclear attack. As Robert Ayson concluded:
In considering the ways in which **[[a terrorist nuclear
attack]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[could]{.underline}]{.mark}**
(wittingly or unwittingly) **[[spark off a wider nuclear
exchange]{.underline}]{.mark}** government leaders are entitled to be
just as worried about their own actions---how they would respond to a
terrorist nuclear attack and how that response might get very
catastrophically out of control---as about the terrorist act per se. If
so, **[states need to do more than consider the best ways to prevent
terrorists from acquiring, deploying and then detonating a nuclear
weapon]{.underline}**. They also need to think about how they can
control themselves in the event of a nuclear terrorist attack (even if
some might suggest this risks handing the terrorist a premature and
unnecessary victory by giving them indirect influence over the choices
states
make).[\[20\]](https://nautilus.org/napsnet/napsnet-special-reports/non-state-terrorism-and-inadvertent-nuclear-war/#_ftn20)

While the Baltic region is incredibly important for NATO, this lack of
focus on **[[the Black Sea]{.underline}]{.mark}** was unfortunate. The
region **[[matters]{.mark} to the U.S. and its NATO allies. The Black
Sea is home to three NATO members]{.underline}** (Romania, Turkey and
Bulgaria) **[and two aspirant NATO countries that face partial Russian
occupation]{.underline}** (Ukraine and Georgia). **[Important oil and
gas transit links crisscross the region. So do many important fiber
optic cables and shipping lanes.]{.underline}**

On the tactical level, Moscow's action in the region and its
militarization of Crimea furthers its goal of making the Black Sea a
Russian lake. Russia has deployed 28,000 troops to Crimea and has
embarked on a major program to build housing, restore airfields, and
install new radars there. In addition, **[Russia has deployed advanced
air defense and anti-ship missiles that give it a leg up above the rest
in terms of controlling the surface and the skies above the Black
Sea]{.underline}**.

**[On the strategic level]{.underline}**, **[[Russia uses the Black Sea
as a springboard to challenge U.S. interests]{.mark} [elsewhere]{.mark}
in the world]{.underline}**. For example, **[[Russia]{.mark} has
[used]{.mark} its [Black Sea]{.mark} presence]{.underline}** on occupied
Crimea **[[to launch]{.underline}]{.mark}** and support naval

**[Syria]{.underline}**, the Moskva, **[[a Russian navy guided]{.mark}

defense]{.mark} for Russian forces]{.underline}**. Hundreds of thousands
of tons of grain and wheat have been shipped from Crimea to Syria to
help the Assad Regime's food shortage problems. Hundreds of trips have
been made between Crimea's port city of Sevastopol and the Russian naval
base in Tartus, Syria to transport military hardware and resupplies.

Thankfully **[[policymakers are]{.mark} now [waking

<https://truthout.org/articles/there-can-be-no-winners-in-a-nuclear-war/>

**[Nuclear war has no winner]{.underline}**. Beginning in 2006, several
of **[the [world's leading climatologists]{.mark}]{.underline}** (at
Rutgers, UCLA, John Hopkins University, and the University of
Colorado-Boulder) **[published a series of studies that evaluated the
long-term environmental consequences of a nuclear war]{.underline}**,
including baseline scenarios fought with merely 1% of the explosive
power in the US and/or Russian launch-ready nuclear arsenals. **[They
[concluded]{.mark} that the consequences of [even a "small" nuclear war
would include catastrophic disruptions of global climate and]{.mark}
massive [destruction of]{.mark} Earth's protective [ozone
layer]{.mark}]{.underline}**. These and more recent studies predict that
global agriculture would be so negatively affected by such a war, a
global famine would result, which would cause up to 2 billion people to
starve to death. **[These [peer-reviewed studies]{.mark}]{.underline}**
-- **[which were analyzed by the best scientists in the world and [found
to be without error]{.mark}]{.underline}** -- also **[[predict]{.mark}
that [a war fought with]{.mark}]{.underline}** less than half of US or
Russian strategic **[[nuclear weapons would destroy the human
race]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In other words, a US-Russian nuclear war
would **[create [such extreme long-term damage]{.mark} to the global
environment that [it would leave the Earth uninhabitable]{.mark} for
humans and most animal forms of life]{.underline}**. A recent article in
the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, "Self-assured destruction: The
climate impacts of nuclear war," begins by stating: "**[A nuclear
war]{.underline}** between Russia and the United States, even after the
arsenal reductions planned under New START, **[could produce a nuclear
winter. Hence, [an attack by either side could]{.mark} be suicidal,
[result]{.mark}ing [in self-assured destruction]{.mark}]{.underline}**."
In 2009, I wrote "Catastrophic Climatic Consequences of Nuclear
Conflicts" for the International Commission on Nuclear Non-proliferation
and Disarmament. The article summarizes the findings of these studies.
**[It explains that [nuclear firestorms]{.mark} would [produce]{.mark}
millions of [tons of smoke,]{.mark} which [would rise]{.mark} above
cloud level [and form a]{.mark} global [stratospheric smoke
layer]{.mark} that would rapidly encircle the Earth. The smoke layer
would remain for at least a decade, and it would act to destroy the
protective ozone layer]{.underline}** (**[vastly increasing the UV-B
reaching Earth]{.underline}**) **[as well as [block]{.mark} warming
[sunlight]{.mark}, thus [creating Ice Age]{.mark} weather
[conditions]{.mark}]{.underline}** that would last 10 years or longer.
Following a US-Russian nuclear war, **[temperatures]{.underline}** in
the central US and Eurasia **[would fall below freezing every
day]{.underline}** for one to three years**[; the [intense cold
would]{.mark} completely [eliminate growing
seasons]{.mark}]{.underline}** for a decade or longer. **[No crops could
be grown, leading to a famine that would [kill most humans]{.mark} and
large animal populations. [Electromagnetic pulse]{.mark} from
high-altitude nuclear detonations would [destroy]{.mark} the integrated
circuits in all modern electronic devices, including those in
[commercial]{.mark} nuclear [power plants]{.mark}. Every [nuclear
reactor would]{.mark} almost [instantly meltdown]{.mark}; every nuclear
spent fuel pool]{.underline}** (which contain many times more
radioactivity than found in the reactors) **[would boil off,
[releasing]{.mark} vast amounts of long-lived [radioactivity]{.mark}.
The fallout]{.underline}** would make most of the US and Europe
**[uninhabitable]{.underline}**. Of course, **[the [survivors]{.mark} of
the nuclear war [would]{.mark} be [starv]{.mark}ing [to
death]{.mark}]{.underline}** anyway. Once nuclear weapons were
introduced into a US-Russian conflict, there would be little chance that
a nuclear holocaust could be avoided. **[Theories of "limited nuclear
war" and "nuclear de-escalation" are unrealistic]{.underline}**. In 2002
the Bush administration modified US strategic doctrine from a
retaliatory role to permit preemptive nuclear attack; in 2010, the Obama
administration made only incremental and miniscule changes to this
doctrine, leaving it essentially unchanged. Furthermore, Counterforce
doctrine -- used by both the US and Russian military -- emphasizes the
need for preemptive strikes once nuclear war begins. Both sides would be
under immense pressure to launch a preemptive nuclear first-strike once
military hostilities had commenced, especially if nuclear weapons had
already been used on the battlefield. Both the US and Russia each have
400 to 500 launch-ready ballistic missiles armed with a total of at
least 1800 strategic nuclear warheads, which can be launched with only a
few minutes warning. Both the US and Russian Presidents are accompanied
24/7 by military officers carrying a "nuclear briefcase," which allows
them to transmit the permission order to launch in a matter of seconds.
Yet top political leaders and policymakers of both the US and Russia
seem to be unaware that their launch-ready nuclear weapons represent a
self-destruct mechanism for the human race. For example, in 2010, I was
able to publicly question the chief negotiators of the New START treaty,
Russian Ambassador Anatoly Antonov and (then) US Assistant Secretary of
State Rose Gottemoeller, during their joint briefing at the UN (during
the Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference). I asked them if they
were familiar with the recent peer-reviewed studies that predicted the
detonation of less than 1% of the explosive power contained in the
operational and deployed US and Russian nuclear forces would cause
catastrophic changes in the global climate, and that a nuclear war
fought with their strategic nuclear weapons would kill most people on
Earth. They both answered "no." More recently, on April 20, 2014, I
asked the same question and received the same answer from the US
officials sent to brief representatives of the NGOS at the
Non-Proliferation Treaty Preparatory Committee meeting at the UN. None
of the US officials at the briefing were aware of the studies. Those
present included top officials of the National Security Council. It is
frightening that President Obama and his administration appear unaware
that the world's leading scientists have for years predicted that a
nuclear war fought with the US and/or Russian strategic nuclear arsenal
means the end of human history. Do they not know of the existential
threat these arsenals pose to the human race . . . or do they choose to
remain silent because this fact doesn't fit into their official
narratives? We hear only about terrorist threats that could destroy a
city with an atomic bomb, while the threat of human extinction from
nuclear war is never mentioned -- even when the US and Russia are each
running huge nuclear war games in preparation for a US-Russian war. Even
more frightening is the fact that the neocons running **[US foreign
policy believe that the US has "nuclear primacy"]{.underline}** over
Russia; **[that is, the US could successfully launch a nuclear sneak
attack against]{.underline}** Russian (and **[Chinese]{.underline}**)
**[nuclear forces and completely destroy them]{.underline}**. This
theory was articulated in 2006 in "The Rise of U.S. Nuclear Primacy,"
which was published in Foreign Affairs by the Council on Foreign
Relations. By concluding that the Russians and Chinese would be unable
to retaliate, or if some small part of their forces remained, would not
risk a second US attack by retaliating, the article invites nuclear war.
Colonel Valery Yarynich (who was in charge of security of the
Soviet/Russian nuclear command and control systems for 7 years) asked me
to help him write a rebuttal, which was titled "**[Nuclear Primacy is a
Fallacy]{.underline}**." Colonel Yarynich, who was on the Soviet General

## Cables Adv/Scenario

### 1AC \-\-- Cables Advantage

#### Underwater cables undergird [global stability]{.underline} facilitating [financial transactions]{.underline} and [military communication]{.underline} -- disruptions cascade [globally]{.underline}.

**Sunak 17** -- Rishi Sunak is the Member of Parliament for Richmond
(Yorkshire). He was elected in 2015 and has the privilege of
representing both the Army's largest garrison, Catterick Garrison, and
also RAF Leeming. (\"Undersea Cables Indispensable, insecure,\" Policy
Exchange, 2017,
https://policyexchange.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Undersea-Cables.pdf,
Accessed 7-1-2022, LASA-SC)

As Rishi Sunak's powerful report highlights, **[we have
allowed]{.underline}** this **[vital infrastructure]{.underline}**
**[of]{.underline}** **[undersea cables]{.underline}** **[to
grow]{.underline}** **[increasingly vulnerable]{.underline}**. **[This
should worry us all.]{.underline}** **[Cables are]{.underline}**
isolated **[in the midst of the oceans]{.underline}**, their locations
are known, **[and they are often subject to only]{.underline}**
**[minimal security]{.underline}** **[at on-shore landing
sites]{.underline}**. Furthermore, the **[technical capabilities
required to damage cables are relatively low]{.underline}** **[and
unsophisticated.]{.underline}** The risk posed to these **[garden
hose-thin connections]{.underline}** that **[carry]{.underline}**
everything from **[military]{.underline}**
**[intelligence]{.underline}** **[to]{.underline}** **[global financial
data]{.underline}** is real and growing. In the most severe scenario of
an **[all-out attack upon undersea cable]{.underline}** infrastructure
**[by a hostile actor]{.underline}** the impact of connectivity loss
**[is]{.underline}** potentially **[catastrophic]{.underline}**, but
**[even]{.underline}** relatively **[limited sabotage]{.underline}**
**[has the potential to]{.underline}** cause significant economic
disruption and **[damage military communications]{.underline}**. The
waters of the Atlantic have long symbolised the spirit of openness and
exploration and, today, the course once charted by the Mayflower is the
world's busiest digital sea-lane. But if that openness is to be
preserved, we must be prepared to act with both creativity and strength.
This Policy Exchange report accurately highlights the
**[Russian]{.underline}** **[dimension to this risk]{.underline}**. Over
my own career, I have seen the **[Atlantic transition from being a
theatre characterised by near complete NATO supremacy following the
collapse of the Soviet Union to a space that Russia is actively
contesting through a resurgent and revanchist naval
doctrine]{.underline}**. This rise in Russia's maritime assertiveness
has been well-documented and in many respects this bellicosity is a
symptom of weakness, attempting to deflect from domestic economic
failures that once led Senator John McCain to describe the Putin regime
as "a gas station masquerading as a country". But if the relative
weakness of the Russian position makes a conventional conflict with NATO
unlikely, it also raises the appeal of asymmetric targets like
fibre-optic cables. **[Recent reports make clear that Russian submarine
forces have undertaken detailed monitoring and targeting activities in
the vicinity of North Atlantic deep-sea cable
infrastructure]{.underline}**. And as another example of Russian
interest in asymmetric targets, it is worth remembering that in Crimea,
**[Russia successfully took control of land based communications
infrastructure early in its annexation of the peninsula]{.underline}**.
Russia's relative weakness also attracts it to conducting hybrid
warfare. The **[fundamental idea of hybrid warfare is hostile activity
that stops short of full, overt, offensive action and is sufficiently
ambiguous that it allows the aggressor plausible deniability and makes
international response more difficult]{.underline}**. Hybrid warfare has
traditionally been land-based, but as I have argued previously, **[this
is about to change and we should prepare for increased maritime hybrid
activity.]{.underline}** Chinese activities in the South China Sea and
Iranian actions in the Arabian Gulf already show characteristics of a
hybrid approach, using civilian vessels rather than easily identifiable
'gray hull' naval platforms to obfuscate the involvement of state
actors**[. Underwater cables are an obvious target for such hostile
action: they are a vital infrastructure asset with ambiguous protection
in international law that can be damaged with relatively
unsophisticated, non-military hardware.]{.underline}** The question that
this provokes is what we should do about it? The recommendations Mr
Sunak sets out in this report are a serious contribution to the field
and a welcome recognition of the precautions that nations like the UK
and the US must take in confronting risks posed to communications
infrastructure. **[As well as the actions each government must take
unilaterally to improve their security, there is much that can be
achieved through partnership]{.underline}**. Firstly, governments
working with private companies can build more redundancy into their
cable systems by creating more "dark cables" which are kept in reserve.
Secondly, **[NATO partners must collectively ready themselves to face
this new mix of naval tactics.]{.underline}** Where necessary, **[NATO
must be prepared to defend global submarine cables]{.underline}**,
**[exactly as we defend our electrical grid, industrial base and
transportation network]{.underline}**s. This **[will require highly
technical and capable undersea navies from allied countries, better used
to working together through regular joint exercises and operations. The
need for sea power is greater than ever.]{.underline}**

the alliance said.

"Each surface ship will have the opportunity to conduct a variety of
submarine warfare operations. The submarines will take turns hunting and
being hunted, closely coordinating their efforts with the air and
surface participants," NATO Maritime Command said in a statement.
Maritime patrol aircraft will also take part.

The drill comes as **[NATO gives increased attention]{.underline}**
**[to the Arctic]{.underline}** and North Atlantic, **[where Russia
has]{.underline}** **[been building up a presence]{.underline}**, and
where melting sea ice will make it easier for commercial and military
vessels to operate in the future, allies have said.

**[Moscow has]{.underline}** "**[taken an]{.underline}** **[aggressive
approach]{.underline}** **[to the Arctic]{.underline}**," reoccupying
old Soviet bases and deploying air defense systems, the commander of
U.S. Naval Forces Europe-Africa, Adm. James Foggo said last week.

"**[We're seeing]{.underline}** a **[new area]{.underline}**
**[of]{.underline}** **[maritime competition]{.underline}** **[in the
Arctic]{.underline}**. Strong **[navies are needed to protect common
interests and ensure the timely flow of trade]{.underline}**," Foggo
said during a virtual speech Thursday for the International Institute
for Strategic Studies.

The **[U.S.]{.underline}** **[is]{.underline}** also
**[concerned]{.underline}** that **[Russian forces could]{.underline}**
**[damage undersea cables]{.underline}** **[that transmit most of the
electronic data between the U.S. and Europe.]{.underline}**

While commanders involved in Dynamic Mongoose did not address such
concerns Monday, officials said the exercises are about preparing for a
"high-end" fight.

"**[Exercises today seize opportunities for NATO and Allied nations to
sharpen warfighting skills]{.underline}** by **[focusing on high-end
capabilities including Anti-Submarine Warfare]{.underline}**," said Vice
Adm. Keith Blount, head of NATO's Allied Maritime Command, in a

https://www.lawfareblog.com/evaluating-russian-threat-undersea-cables,
Accessed 7-1-2022, LASA-SC)

**[Is]{.underline}** **[vital internet infrastructure]{.underline}**
**[at risk from]{.underline}** new **[Russian naval
capabilities]{.underline}**? **[NATO's]{.underline}** military
**[leadership]{.underline}** **[has warned]{.underline}** in recent
months **[that the Russian navy is aggressively]{.underline}**
**[probing undersea communications cable networks]{.underline}**.
**[These cables]{.underline}** form a global infrastructure system that
**[transmits]{.underline}** **[99 percent]{.underline}** **[of
the]{.underline}** international data sent over the
**[internet]{.underline}**. **[Should we be concerned]{.underline}**?
Despite the ominous warnings, defense officials have not provided much
specific information about the actual substance of the Russian threat.

**[In the worst scenario]{.underline}**, **[an attack that cut submarine
cables]{.underline}** coming into the United States
**[could]{.underline}** **[significantly harm]{.underline}** its access
to **[the global internet]{.underline}**. Ordinary users would probably
experience massive losses in bandwidth, particularly for services such
as Google and Facebook that host much of their data overseas.
**[Since]{.underline}** most **[government]{.underline}** also **[relies
on commercial internet infrastructure]{.underline}**, **[the outages
would also interrupt official communications]{.underline}**. **[Any data
hosted outside the U.S. would become nearly inaccessible to U.S. parties
and vice versa]{.underline}**. For people who depend on the internet in
daily life, such an attack would be a national disaster. But it is not
clear whether NATO believes Russia has the capability or the intention
of attacking cable networks in that fashion.

What is known about this problem can be broken down into four
categories: **[Russia's cable warfare capabilities, the Russian navy's
potential underwater targets, potential effects from damage to submarine
cables, and NATO's publicly acknowledged efforts to respond to
Russia.]{.underline}** In this post, I summarize existing information on
each of these and then pose outstanding questions about the potential
Russian threat. My earlier piece on Lawfare provides more background on
submarine cables as well as the international law protecting them.

**[Russia's]{.underline}** cable warfare **[capabilities]{.underline}**

**[Moscow]{.underline}** **[threatens]{.underline}** **[undersea
cables]{.underline}** primarily **[with]{.underline}**
**[submarines]{.underline}** and spy ships **[that deploy deep-sea
submersibles.]{.underline}** At DefenseOne, a national security news
site from Atlantic Media, Magnus Nordenman detailed how **[Russia has
converted ballistic missile subs to deploy the highly
secretive]{.underline}** AS-12 Losharik **[deep-sea
submarine]{.underline}**. The Losharik can dive down thousands of
meters, enabling it to target cables at depths that would be very
difficult to repair.

The most prominent Russian spy ship is the Yantar. Classified as an
\"oceanographic research vessel,\" the Yantar on its 2015 voyage probing
a cable route to Cuba provoked some of the first reporting that Russia
was targeting cables. That trip drew attention to the Yantar's
capabilities for intelligence operations. It carries advanced
surveillance equipment, including a remotely operated underwater vehicle
and two manned submersibles that the BBC reported can dive about 6,000
meters. For context, the average depth of the ocean floor is about 3,700
meters.

**[With all its advanced gear, the Yantar has been busy since it came
into service in 2015. The ship deployed off a U.S. submarine base in
Georgia in 2015]{.underline}**, **[located the wrecks of crashed Russian
fighter jets in the eastern Mediterranean in 2016 and assisted in the
search for a missing Argentine submarine in 2017.]{.underline}** The
Russian navy is scheduled to complete construction on a second
Yantar-class ship in 2019 and to begin building a third in 2020.

https://www.wired.co.uk/article/apocalypse-no\]

Many **[great [civilisations]{.mark} have
[fall]{.mark}en]{.underline}**, leaving nothing but cracked ruins and
scattered genetics. Usually this results
**[[from]{.underline}]{.mark}**: natural **[disasters, resource
depletion]{.underline}**, economic meltdown, **[disease, [poor
info]{.mark}rmation [flow]{.mark}]{.underline}** and corruption. **[But
we're luckier]{.underline}** than our predecessors **[because we
command]{.underline}** a technology that no one else possessed: **[a
rapid communication network that finds its highest expression in the
[internet]{.mark}]{.underline}**. I propose that there are six ways in
which **[the net has vastly reduced the threat of societal
collapse]{.underline}**.

**[Epidemics can be deflected by telepresence]{.underline}**

One of our more dire prospects for collapse is an infectious-disease
epidemic. **[Viral and bacterial epidemics precipitated the fall
of]{.underline}** the Golden Age of Athens, **[the Roman Empire
and]{.underline}** most of the empires of the **[Native Americans. The
internet can be our key to survival because the ability to work
telepresently can inhibit microbial transmission by reducing
human-to-human contact]{.underline}**. In the face of an otherwise
devastating epidemic, businesses can keep supply chains running with the
maximum number of employees working from home. This can reduce host
density below the tipping point required for an epidemic. If we are well
prepared when an epidemic arrives, **[we can fluidly shift into a
self-quarantined society]{.underline}** in which microbes fail due to
host scarcity. Whatever the social ills of isolation, they are worse for
the microbes than for us.

The internet will predict natural disasters

We are witnessing the downfall of slow central control in the media:
news stories are increasingly becoming user-generated nets of
up-to-the-minute information. During the recent California wildfires,
locals went to the TV stations to learn whether their neighbourhoods
were in danger. But the news stations appeared most concerned with the
fate of celebrity mansions, so Californians changed their tack: they
uploaded geotagged mobile-phone pictures, updated Facebook statuses and
tweeted. The balance tipped: **[the [internet carried
news]{.mark}]{.underline}** about the fire **[more quickly and
[accurately]{.mark}]{.underline}** than any news station could. In this
grass-roots, decentralised scheme, there were embedded reporters on
every block, and the news shockwave kept ahead of the fire. This head
start could provide the extra hours that save us. If the Pompeiians had
had the internet in 79AD, they could have easily marched 10km to safety,
well ahead of the pyroclastic flow from Mount Vesuvius. If the Indian
Ocean had the Pacific's networked tsunami-warning system, South-East
Asia would look quite different today.

Discoveries are retained and shared

**[Historically, critical information has required constant rediscovery.
Collections of learning]{.underline}** \-- from the library at
Alexandria to the entire Minoan civilisation \-- **[have fallen to the
bonfires of invaders or the wrecking ball of natural disaster. Knowledge
is]{.underline}** hard won but **[easily lost]{.underline}**. And
information that survives often does not spread. Consider smallpox
inoculation: this was under way in India, China and Africa centuries
before it made its way to Europe. By the time the idea reached North
America, native civilisations who needed it had already collapsed.
**[The net solved the problem. [New discoveries catch on
immediately]{.mark}; information spreads widely]{.underline}**. In this
way, societies can optimally ratchet up, using the latest bricks of
knowledge in their fortification against risk.

**[[Tyranny is mitigated]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Censorship of ideas was a familiar spectre in the last century, with
state-approved news outlets ruling the press, airwaves and copying
machines in the USSR, Romania, Cuba, China, Iraq and elsewhere. In many
cases, such as Lysenko's agricultural despotism in the USSR, it directly
contributed to the collapse of the nation. Historically, a more
successful strategy has been to confront free speech with free speech
\-- and the internet allows this in a natural way. It democratises the
flow of information by offering access to the newspapers of the world,
the photographers of every nation, the bloggers of every political
stripe. Some posts are full of doctoring and dishonesty whereas others
strive for independence and impartiality \-- but all are available to us
to sift through. Given the attempts by some governments to build
firewalls, it's clear that this benefit of the net requires constant
vigilance.

**[Human capital is vastly increased]{.underline}**

**[Crowdsourcing brings people together to solve problems. Yet far fewer
than one per cent of the world's population is involved. We need expand
human capital]{.underline}**. Most of the world not have access to the
education afforded a small minority. For every Albert Einstein, Yo-Yo Ma
or Barack Obama who has educational opportunities, uncountable others do
not. This squandering of talent translates into reduced economic output
and a smaller pool of problem solvers. The net opens the gates education
to anyone with a computer. A motivated teen anywhere on the planet can
walk through the world's knowledge \-- from the webs of Wikipedia to the
curriculum of MIT's OpenCourseWare. The new **[[human capital]{.mark}
will [serve us]{.mark} well when [we confront existential
threats]{.mark} we've never imagined before]{.underline}**.

Energy expenditure is reduced

Societal collapse can often be understood in terms of an energy budget:
when energy spend outweighs energy return, collapse ensues. This has
taken the form of deforestation or soil erosion; currently, the worry
involves fossil-fuel depletion. The internet addresses the energy
problem with a natural ease. **[Consider the massive energy
savings]{.underline}** inherent in the shift from paper to electrons \--
as seen in the transition from the post to email. Ecommerce reduces the
need to drive long distances to purchase products. Delivery trucks are
more eco-friendly than individuals driving around, not least because of
tight packaging and optimisation algorithms for driving routes. Of
course, there are energy costs to the banks of computers that underpin
the internet \-- but these costs are less than the wood, coal and oil
that would be expended for the same quantity of information flow.

The tangle of events that triggers societal collapse can be complex, and
there are several threats the net does not address. But **[vast,
networked [communication]{.mark} can be an [antidote to]{.mark} several
of the most deadly [diseases threatening
civilisation]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The next time your coworker laments
internet addiction, the banality of tweeting or the decline of
face-to-face conversation, you may want to suggest that the net may just
be the technology that saves us.

III\. THE **[RUSSIAN SUBMARINE THREAT TO NATO]{.underline}** A.
**[SUBMARINES IN RUSSIA'S STRATEGY]{.underline}** 15. **[Russia's
submarines must be placed in the context of the larger strategic
picture, as submarines play a vital role in]{.underline}** this respect.
**[Russia's]{.underline}** **[grand strategy]{.underline}** remains
**[to reclaim its status as a great power on the global
stage]{.underline}**. **[A key pillar]{.underline}** of this effort
**[is]{.underline}** a substantial military modernisation premised on
high levels of defence spending. Russia does not publish reliable,
transparent figures on this spending. According to one of the most
reliable estimates, the level of defence spending has fallen slightly
since its high point in 2015, when Russia spent 4.83% of its GDP on
defence. Still, in 2018, it remained high at 4% (IISS, 2019).
Regardless, Russian military spending, including on
**[submarines]{.underline}**, does not need to be high to achieve
effective asymmetric effects, as should become clear below. 16.
Alongside military modernisation, Russia continues to seek political and
military buffer zones in what it calls its 'near abroad'. For one,
**[Russia pursues hybrid and asymmetric tactics to create strategic
uncertainty and localised surprises]{.underline}** (Metrick and Hicks,
2018). Additionally, its leadership pursues targeted tactical overmatch
by creating anti-access/area-denial (A2/AD) 'bubbles' (Metrick and
Hicks, 2018). Russia's northern shores and the Baltic and Black Seas are
critical links in this A2/AD approach. 17. **[Russia's maritime
strategy]{.underline}** seeks to **[fulfil]{.underline}** several
fundamental goals, most prominently the **[provision]{.underline}** and
protection **[of]{.underline}** its **[submarine-based nuclear
deterrent]{.underline}**, the defence of its homeland, and increasing
Russia's power, influence, and economic strength (Allport, 2018). As an
important consequence, the Russian navy continues to prioritise a) the
**[replacement of its submarines equipped with nuclear
warheads]{.underline}**, b) **[strengthening its naval forces for
conventional anti-surface]{.underline}** 150 STC 19 E rev. 1 fin 4
warfare and land attack (Allport, 2018), **[and c) improving its
capabilities for asymmetric and maritime hybrid
operations.]{.underline}** 18. Overall, Russia's naval capabilities
still remain "vastly inferior to the collective power of the Alliance"
(Allport, 2018). As in other domains, Moscow seeks to compensate by
maximising its asymmetric strengths -- often to great effect. That is
one reason Russia also turns to maritime hybrid tactics, "to turn its
weak hand into a strong one", notes Admiral James G. Stavridis, former
NATO Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) (Stavridis, 2018). In
hybrid scenarios, Russia could employ the full range of military and
civilian capabilities and operate as ambiguously as possible (Stavridis,
2018). Submarines are well suited for hybrid tactics, as they can create
deniable effects and conduct seabed operations. 19. In particular,
**[Allied defence leaders have sounded warnings]{.underline}** **[that
Russia could tap or sever undersea communication cables]{.underline}**
(see Box 1 and Map 2). **[Its vessels have been spotted near these
cables]{.underline}**, perhaps to map the network. **[Although designed
with redundancy in mind, the tapping or severing of undersea
communication cables could be extremely consequential for transatlantic
and intra-European communications]{.underline}**. **[If
Russia]{.underline}** or any other state **[could tap into this
network,]{.underline}** **[it could covertly gain
intelligence]{.underline}** **[of strategic importance]{.underline}**,
for example on financial streams, trading data, and classified military
or government information. The **[international trading and financial
systems are critically dependent on this network]{.underline}**. **[A
disruption would have massive and immediate effects on economic
markets]{.underline}** (BBC, 2017; Stavridis, 2018). As Keir Giles, a
senior consulting fellow at Chatham House has argued, Russia has learnt
from its Crimea campaign: "physical access to the **[communications
infrastructure and telecommunications]{.underline}**" was the **[key to
information dominance]{.underline}** (BBC, 2017). 20. **[Currently, no
truly effective systems for monitoring undersea cable networks
exist]{.underline}** (Analytic Exchange Progam, 2017). **[Hence, a key
advantage of disrupting undersea cables lies in
deniability]{.underline}**. A 2008 incident illustrates this. No bad
actor was behind the **[near-simultaneous cutting of undersea
cables]{.underline}** from the Middle East to Europe and Asia. A ship
dragging an anchor and an undersea landslide were responsible. However,
if this **[happened to cables crucial for the Allies, how could they be
sure a state was behind this]{.underline}** (Smith and Hendrix, 2017)?
**[Even if one Ally had good intelligence, would it be able to share
enough]{.underline}** to convince others? **[And what would happen if
this took place at critical points in time]{.underline}**? One senior
interlocutor during the recent STCTTS visit to the United Kingdom said
that Russia could lay mines near these cables. If they were detonated at
the right time, **[the Alliance could lose a war before it would even
start]{.underline}**. **[It is time for NATO to come up with a good
answer.]{.underline}** 21. With Moscow's revived focus on submarines,
two classic Cold War concepts of operations have made a return when it
comes to the North Atlantic: 'bastions' and 'bastion defence' (Olsen,
2018). Bastions are those maritime zones where Russia concentrates its
at-sea nuclear deterrent. Naturally, Russia wants to keep these
strategic submarines safe and thus heavily protects these bastions.
Russia's European bastion is centred on its northern shores (see Map 3).
Beyond the bastion, a defensive perimeter of bastion defence stretches
all the way to the so-called Greenland-Iceland-UK gap (GIUK gap). One
reason the GIUK gap is important to Russia is the fact that, from this
line onwards, US assets equipped with Tomahawk cruise missiles can hit
vital targets in Russia (Allport, 2018). Russia cannot challenge the
Alliance for control of the North Atlantic (Olsen, 2018). Thus, Russian
naval assets, most importantly tactical submarines, would seek to deny
access to Allied vessels venturing beyond the gap in times of crisis or
war (Olsen, 2018). 22. Not every element of Russian maritime strategy,
naval modernisation, and operational activities should be seen as
inherently threatening. After all, the Russian military was at a
particularly low point when it initiated modernisation efforts.
Reasonable experts differ on whether Russia's evolving maritime posture
is defensively or offensively oriented. Some argue that Russia's
maritime strategy and posture is defensive at its core (Allport, 2018).
Others read Moscow's actions as geared towards the offensive (Olsen,
2018). 150 STC 19 E rev. 1 fin 5 23. The Rapporteur would agree with the
latter. One basic problem of Russia's strategy is that actions Russia
would (want to) perceive as defensive -- denying access beyond the GIUK
gap to protect its nuclear arsenal -- should be seen as a strategic
challenge to the Alliance -- threatening the transatlantic link. Box 1:
Notable quotes on the threat against undersea cables 24. Another element
in Russia's naval modernisation also points towards an offensively
oriented posture: the new Kalibr-3M14 long-range precision-guided
missiles which can target both surface vessels and land targets from as
far as 1,500 to 2,500 kilometres. As a result, **[Russian
submarines]{.underline}** **[not only present a threat to the
transatlantic link]{.underline}**; **[they can now also deny access to
Alliance littorals in support of the much broader A2/AD
threat]{.underline}** (Tamnes, 2018). Kalibr missiles could hold
critical nodes deep in Alliance territory at risk, even when on station
in the Barents and White Seas. Indeed, Russia has tested launching these
missiles from their home base, significantly reducing the time to launch
(O'Dwyer, 2019). If the upper estimate holds true, a submarine in the
White Sea could place a Kalibr on NATO Headquarters in Brussels and at
least 13 Allied capitals (see also Map 4). In a crisis or war, Russian
submarines could target critical disembarkation ports for troop
reinforcements and potentially even North Admiral (Ret.) James
Stavridis, former NATO Supreme Allied Commander Europe (Sunak, 2017):
"**[Recent reports make clear that Russian submarine forces have
undertaken detailed monitoring and targeting activities in the vicinity
of North Atlantic deep-sea cable infrastructure]{.underline}**." Air
Chief Marshal Sir Stuart Peach, Chief of the Defence Staff, UK Ministry
of Defence (Peach, 2017): "**[There is a new risk to our way of
life]{.underline}** **[that is the vulnerability of the cables that
crisscross the seabed."]{.underline}** Arnor Sigursjonsson, Director
General of the Defence Directorate in Iceland's Ministry of Foreign
Affairs, December 2018 (Willet, 2018): "\[**[Undersea
cables]{.underline}**\] are not only linking Iceland to Europe and to
North America, but they **[are the linkages between North America and

### Uniq \-\-- Cables at Risk

#### Cables are [increasingly vulnerable]{.underline} -- ASW is key to protection

**Sunak 17** -- Rishi Sunak is the Member of Parliament for Richmond
(Yorkshire). He was elected in 2015 and has the privilege of
representing both the Army's largest garrison, Catterick Garrison, and
also RAF Leeming. (\"Undersea Cables Indispensable, insecure,\" Policy
Exchange, 2017,
https://policyexchange.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Undersea-Cables.pdf,
Accessed 7-1-2022, LASA-SC)

As Rishi Sunak's powerful report highlights, **[we have
allowed]{.underline}** this **[vital infrastructure]{.underline}**
**[of]{.underline}** **[undersea cables]{.underline}** **[to
grow]{.underline}** **[increasingly vulnerable]{.underline}**. **[This
should worry us all.]{.underline}** **[Cables are]{.underline}**
isolated **[in the midst of the oceans]{.underline}**, their locations
are known, **[and they are often subject to only]{.underline}**
**[minimal security]{.underline}** **[at on-shore landing
sites]{.underline}**. Furthermore, the **[technical capabilities
required to damage cables are relatively low]{.underline}** **[and
unsophisticated.]{.underline}** The risk posed to these **[garden
hose-thin connections]{.underline}** that **[carry]{.underline}**
everything from **[military]{.underline}**
**[intelligenc]{.underline}**e **[to]{.underline}** **[global financial
data]{.underline}** is real and growing. In the most severe scenario of
an **[all-out attack upon undersea cable]{.underline}** infrastructure
**[by a hostile actor]{.underline}** the impact of connectivity loss
**[is]{.underline}** potentially **[catastrophic]{.underline}**, but
**[even]{.underline}** relatively **[limited sabotage]{.underline}**
**[has the potential to]{.underline}** cause significant economic
disruption and **[damage military communications]{.underline}**. The
waters of the Atlantic have long symbolised the spirit of openness and
exploration and, today, the course once charted by the Mayflower is the
world's busiest digital sea-lane. But if that openness is to be
preserved, we must be prepared to act with both creativity and strength.
This Policy Exchange report accurately highlights the
**[Russian]{.underline}** **[dimension to this risk]{.underline}**. Over
my own career, I have seen the **[Atlantic transition from being a
theatre characterised by near complete NATO supremacy following the
collapse of the Soviet Union to a space that Russia is actively
contesting through a resurgent and revanchist naval
doctrine]{.underline}**. This rise in Russia's maritime assertiveness
has been well-documented and in many respects this bellicosity is a
symptom of weakness, attempting to deflect from domestic economic
failures that once led Senator John McCain to describe the Putin regime
as "a gas station masquerading as a country". But if the relative
weakness of the Russian position makes a conventional conflict with NATO
unlikely, it also raises the appeal of asymmetric targets like
fibre-optic cables. **[Recent reports make clear that Russian submarine
forces have undertaken detailed monitoring and targeting activities in
the vicinity of North Atlantic deep-sea cable
infrastructure]{.underline}**. And as another example of Russian
interest in asymmetric targets, it is worth remembering that in Crimea,
**[Russia successfully took control of land based communications
infrastructure early in its annexation of the peninsula]{.underline}**.
Russia's relative weakness also attracts it to conducting hybrid
warfare. The **[fundamental idea of hybrid warfare is hostile activity
that stops short of full, overt, offensive action and is sufficiently
ambiguous that it allows the aggressor plausible deniability and makes
international response more difficult]{.underline}**. Hybrid warfare has
traditionally been land-based, but as I have argued previously, **[this
is about to change and we should prepare for increased maritime hybrid
activity.]{.underline}** Chinese activities in the South China Sea and
Iranian actions in the Arabian Gulf already show characteristics of a
hybrid approach, using civilian vessels rather than easily identifiable
'gray hull' naval platforms to obfuscate the involvement of state
actors**[. Underwater cables are an obvious target for such hostile
action: they are a vital infrastructure asset with ambiguous protection
in international law that can be damaged with relatively
unsophisticated, non-military hardware.]{.underline}** The question that
this provokes is what we should do about it? The recommendations Mr
Sunak sets out in this report are a serious contribution to the field
and a welcome recognition of the precautions that nations like the UK
and the US must take in confronting risks posed to communications
infrastructure. **[As well as the actions each government must take
unilaterally to improve their security, there is much that can be
achieved through partnership]{.underline}**. Firstly, governments
working with private companies can build more redundancy into their
cable systems by creating more "dark cables" which are kept in reserve.
Secondly, **[NATO partners must collectively ready themselves to face
this new mix of naval tactics.]{.underline}** Where necessary, **[NATO
must be prepared to defend global submarine cables]{.underline}**,
**[exactly as we defend our electrical grid, industrial base and
transportation network]{.underline}**s. This **[will require highly
technical and capable undersea navies from allied countries, better used
to working together through regular joint exercises and operations. The
need for sea power is greater than ever.]{.underline}**

#### Cutting cables would be REALLY BAD

**David 22** -- Rona has been a journalist for over 20 years,
collaborating with various media trusts: Pro Tv, Prima Tv, RFI,

and Security Threats,\" Energy Industry Review, 3-25-2022,

**[Cutting]{.underline}** **[submarine cables]{.underline}**,
**[a]{.underline}**n old and **[proven]{.underline}** **[practice of
war]{.underline}**

Recent attacks on cables carrying voice and data traffic between North
America and Europe lead to the idea that they seem to be undergoing a
new development. France and the United Kingdom had already dealt with
this experience on the part of the Germans during the First World War.
These infrastructures were part of the global cable telegraph network.
Similarly, the United States cut wartime cables as a means of disrupting
the ability of an enemy power to command and control distant forces.

The first such attacks took place in 1898, during the Spanish-American
War. That year, in the Gulf of Manila (Philippines), the USS Zafiro cut
the cable connecting Manila to the Asian continent to isolate the
Philippines from the rest of the world, as well as the cable connecting
Manila to the Philippine city of Capiz. Other spectacular cable attacks
took place in the Caribbean, plunging Spain into the dark during the
conflict in Puerto Rico and Cuba, which contributed greatly to the final
victory of the United States.

Russia interested in NATO's subsea infrastructure

**[Russia]{.underline}** **[seems to materialize the
concerns]{.underline}** **[at the highest level in this
field.]{.underline}** In 2015, the **[presence of Russian
vessel]{.underline}** Yantar along the US coast, **[near the
cables]{.underline}**, **[did not fail to arouse tensions between the
two states. At the end of 2017]{.underline}**, **[the situation
repeated.]{.underline}**

"**[We are]{.underline}** now **[seeing Russian]{.underline}**
**[underwater activity]{.underline}** **[in the vicinity of undersea
cables that I don't believe we have ever seen]{.underline}**. **[Russia
is clearly taking an interest in NATO and NATO nations' undersea
infrastructure]{.underline}**," said Admiral Andrew Lennon, commander of
the organization's submarine forces. **[It's like going back to the days
of the Cold War]{.underline}**... To the point where Policy Exchange has
devoted an entire chapter of its "Russia Risk" report to this topic. The
think tank recalls the episode of the annexation of Crimea in 2014, when
the peninsula was isolated from the rest of Ukraine by physically
cutting off communications.

"If the relative weakness of the Russian position makes a conventional
conflict with NATO unlikely, **[fibre-optic cables can be a target for
Russia]{.underline}**. We should prepare for an **[increase in hybrid
actions in the maritime field, not only in Russia, but also in China and
Iran]{.underline}**," underlines the former commander of the NATO allied
forces, the American Admiral James G. Stravridis.

Three major security risks

The first risk factor is the **[growing]{.underline}** **[volume of
data]{.underline}** **[flowing through cables]{.underline}**, **[which
encourages third countries to spy on or disrupt traffic.]{.underline}**

The second risk factor is the **[increasing capital intensity of these
facilities]{.underline}**, **[which leads to the creation of
international consortia involving up to dozens of owners]{.underline}**.
These owners are separated from the entities that produce the cable
components and from those that position the cables along the ocean
floor. **[Timeshare makes it possible to reduce costs substantially, but
at the same time allows the entry in these consortia of state actors who
could use their influence to disrupt data flows, or even to interrupt
them in a conflict scenario]{.underline}**. At the other end of the
spectrum, GAFAMs (Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, and Microsoft) now
have the financial and technical capacity to build their own cables.
Thus, the Dunant cable, which links France to the United States, is
entirely owned by Google. **[The Chinese giants have also embarked on a
strategy of submarine conquest: this is the case of the Peace cable,
which connects China to Marseilles, owned by the Hengtong company,
considered by the Chinese government as a model of
"civilian-military".]{.underline}**

**[Another threat is]{.underline}** **[espionage]{.underline}**,
**[which requires specially equipped submarines, or submarines operating
from ships, capable of intercepting, or even modifying, data passing
through fibre-optic cables without damaging them. So far, only China,
Russia and the United States have such means.]{.underline}**

The most vulnerable point of submarine cables, however, is where they
reach land: the landing stations Thus, the town of Lège-Cap-Ferret,
where the interface room between the Franco-American cable "Amitié" will
be built, has recently become a veritable nest of spies, according to
informed sources.

**[Is]{.underline}** **[vital internet infrastructure]{.underline}**
**[at risk from]{.underline}** new **[Russian naval
capabilities]{.underline}**? **[NATO's]{.underline}** military
**[leadership]{.underline}** **[has warned]{.underline}** in recent
months **[that the Russian navy is aggressively]{.underline}**
**[probing undersea communications cable networks]{.underline}**.
**[These cables]{.underline}** form a global infrastructure system that
**[transmits]{.underline}** **[99 percent]{.underline}** **[of
the]{.underline}** international data sent over the
**[internet]{.underline}**. **[Should we be concerned]{.underline}**?
Despite the ominous warnings, defense officials have not provided much
specific information about the actual substance of the Russian threat.

**[In the worst scenario]{.underline}**, **[an attack that cut submarine
cables]{.underline}** coming into the United States
**[could]{.underline}** **[significantly harm]{.underline}** its access
to **[the global internet]{.underline}**. Ordinary users would probably
experience massive losses in bandwidth, particularly for services such
as Google and Facebook that host much of their data overseas.
**[Since]{.underline}** most **[government]{.underline}** also **[relies
on commercial internet infrastructure]{.underline}**, **[the outages
would also interrupt official communications]{.underline}**. **[Any data
hosted outside the U.S. would become nearly inaccessible to U.S. parties
and vice versa]{.underline}**. For people who depend on the internet in
daily life, such an attack would be a national disaster. But it is not
clear whether NATO believes Russia has the capability or the intention
of attacking cable networks in that fashion.

What is known about this problem can be broken down into four
categories: **[Russia's cable warfare capabilities, the Russian navy's
potential underwater targets, potential effects from damage to submarine
cables, and NATO's publicly acknowledged efforts to respond to
Russia.]{.underline}** In this post, I summarize existing information on
each of these and then pose outstanding questions about the potential
Russian threat. My earlier piece on Lawfare provides more background on
submarine cables as well as the international law protecting them.

**[Russia's]{.underline}** cable warfare **[capabilities]{.underline}**

**[Moscow]{.underline}** **[threatens]{.underline}** **[undersea
cables]{.underline}** primarily **[with]{.underline}**
**[submarines]{.underline}** and spy ships **[that deploy deep-sea
submersibles.]{.underline}** At DefenseOne, a national security news
site from Atlantic Media, Magnus Nordenman detailed how **[Russia has
converted ballistic missile subs to deploy the highly
secretive]{.underline}** AS-12 Losharik **[deep-sea
submarine]{.underline}**. The Losharik can dive down thousands of
meters, enabling it to target cables at depths that would be very
difficult to repair.

The most prominent Russian spy ship is the Yantar. Classified as an
\"oceanographic research vessel,\" the Yantar on its 2015 voyage probing
a cable route to Cuba provoked some of the first reporting that Russia
was targeting cables. That trip drew attention to the Yantar's
capabilities for intelligence operations. It carries advanced
surveillance equipment, including a remotely operated underwater vehicle
and two manned submersibles that the BBC reported can dive about 6,000
meters. For context, the average depth of the ocean floor is about 3,700
meters.

**[With all its advanced gear, the Yantar has been busy since it came
into service in 2015. The ship deployed off a U.S. submarine base in
Georgia in 2015]{.underline}**, **[located the wrecks of crashed Russian
fighter jets in the eastern Mediterranean in 2016 and assisted in the
search for a missing Argentine submarine in 2017.]{.underline}** The
Russian navy is scheduled to complete construction on a second
Yantar-class ship in 2019 and to begin building a third in 2020.

power is emerging]{.underline}** --- **[unmanned

Nearly two decades into the 21st Century, **[both nations are
putting]{.underline}** **[significant effort]{.underline}** **[into
adding autonomous and semi-autonomous platforms to their surface and
subsurface naval forces]{.underline}**. The **[underwater
realm]{.underline}** is the most difficult because of the limitations of
underwater communications, which **[makes]{.underline}** **[some form of
artificial intelligence]{.underline}** (AI) **[mandatory]{.underline}**.

China has been uncharacteristically open about its intentions for AI,
from an announced underwater city inhabited and operated entirely by
robots to official government goals of capitalizing on AI to transform
their military into the strongest in the world.

While **[Chinese government spending on AI research is far
greater]{.underline}** **[than that of the U.S]{.underline}**., however,
a large percentage of global effort is coming from the U.S. commercial
sector, on which the Pentagon relies heavily for technology advances.
Still, **[Chinese companies also are increasing their AI
investments.]{.underline}**

The **[influence of massive spending]{.underline}** **[on]{.underline}**
developing **[AI for undersea systems portends the greatest change in
military sea power since the introduction of nuclear-powered
vessels.]{.underline}**

"Equipping our military vessels with a higher-level of artificial
intelligence is the answer to the increasing size and complexity of data
to be processed as well as the need to reduce staff," says Dominique
Giannoni, an executive at Thales Underwater Systems in Valbonne, France.

**[China]{.underline}** **[autonomous undersea]{.underline}**
**[efforts]{.underline}**

In a rare July 2018 interview with the South **[China]{.underline}**
Morning Post, Lin Yang, director of a classified program at the Shenyang
Institute of Automation in Shenyang, China, says her country has
**[plans to develop new-generation military underwater
robots]{.underline}** by 2021. His 912 Project's goal is to develop
AI-driven unmanned submarines to handle surveillance, mine laying, and
attack missions.

Western China-watchers say the **[Chinese navy has several AI-enabled
vessels]{.underline}** in development --- **[with a focus on autonomous
submarines]{.underline}** --- as **[part of a major push to overtake
U.S. dominance in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond.]{.underline}**
That includes 100-foot long extra-large unmanned underwater vehicles
(XLUUVs) intended for deployment early in the next decade.

Another civilian project is China's most ambitious undersea AI effort to
date, with significant military potential. In **[2018, China announced
it was working on an AI-run underwater base, equipped with autonomous
submarines to extend its reach]{.underline}**.

According to published reports, the **[submarines would deploy for
investigation and scientific surveillance missions, then return to the
unmanned base to download data and recharge]{.underline}**. The base
itself, located on the ocean floor as deep as 36,000 feet, also would
conduct research on the immediate area, process and fuse all collected
data, and transmit the results to a surface ship or land station.

No location for the base or a timetable for its deployment have been
released, but, given the speed with which China is developing AI across
the board, and especially for undersea applications, the first elements
are expected in the near future.

While being promoted as a major advance in research on undersea life and
topography**[, the military potential of such long-endurance unmanned
cooperative systems cannot be ignored.]{.underline}**

**[China must]{.underline}** "grasp the changes of national security
circumstances, **[speed up preparations for military
struggl]{.underline}**e, including battle planning, **[capacity building
and command system building]{.underline}**," Chinese President Xi
Jinping said in a speech during a naval inspection in Qingdao, China,
according to China Daily.

**[Russia also is putting considerable effort into AI]{.underline}**,
but is not believed to be anywhere near the level of the U.S. or China.

**[U.S]{.underline}**. autonomous undersea **[programs]{.underline}**

The 2020 Pentagon budget request cites advances of potential adversaries
in asking for major funding increases for autonomous weapons programs.
Requests include a **[ten-fold increase in spending on large unmanned
surface vessels]{.underline}** by the Navy and more than 50 percent more
for Army robotics development. The requests total \$3.7 billion on
unmanned systems across the services, plus another \$900 million on AI.

The Embracing Artificial Intelligence in Undersea Warfare session at the
Navy Submarine League's Submarine Technology Symposium in May summarized
the U.S. Navy's increasing focus on AI --- especially undersea:

"**[As the current submarine force trusts mechanical and electrical
technology to execute the mission]{.underline}**, **[the future force
will need to trust AI]{.underline}** **[to extract and exploit
actionable patterns among an ocean of data]{.underline}**," the session
says. "The advent of big data and deep learning technology has rendered
signal detection and classification an increasingly automated process.
**[Furthermore, advances in autonomous navigation have enabled unmanned
platforms to operate alone or in swarms.]{.underline}**

"**[It will be]{.underline}** **[critical]{.underline}** for the 21st
century **[that the undersea fleet advance in its AI
capabilities]{.underline}**, **[develop algorithms that are intuitive
and explainable, cultivate users' trust in AI]{.underline}**,
**[and]{.underline}** **[design]{.underline}** **[future
systems]{.underline}** **[around the use of AI]{.underline}**.
Meanwhile, we must also recognize our adversaries' disruptive AI

**[Despite]{.underline}** technological **[strides]{.underline}**
**[in]{.underline}** **[AI]{.underline}**, **[unmanned maritime vessels
face a host of new and potentially disabling challenges]{.underline}**
--- **[especially in underwater applications]{.underline}**. A 2014 Rand
Corp. research paper on Designing Unmanned Systems with Greater Autonomy
looked at how AI is being implemented --- and researched for future
application --- across the board for unmanned systems. The report also
noted the unique challenges facing UUV autonomy.

"**[Achieving]{.underline}** and maintaining
**[communication]{.underline}** **[with underwater
vehicles]{.underline}** and even with surface vehicles
**[is]{.underline}** technically **[challenging]{.underline}**,
especially at longer ranges. **[Water attenuates radio waves and other
wireless signals that can easily be used at long range in air-to-ground
or air-to-air communications]{.underline}**," the report stated. "This
means that high-bandwidth communications underwater are largely
impractical using traditional communication technologies."

"Although there has been some experimentation with laser communications
for underwater applications, laser communications systems are expensive
and consume considerable amounts of power. **[Because of these
communications limitations, UUVs that do not require continuous
communications links are essential]{.underline}**. For example,
**[autonomous path planning is needed to avoid underwater obstacles and
unanticipated terrain features."]{.underline}**

### Uniq \-\-- Russia Cuts Cables Now

####  Russian [submarine dominance]{.underline} causes [cable cutting]{.underline}\-\--[deniability]{.underline} makes it [highly likely]{.underline}. Assumes [cable redundancy]{.underline}

19\. In particular, **[Allied defence leaders]{.underline}** have
**[sounded warnings]{.underline}** that **[Russia could]{.underline}**
tap or **[sever undersea]{.underline}** communication
**[cables]{.underline}** (see Box 1 and Map 2). Its **[vessels have
been]{.underline}** **[spotted near these cables]{.underline}**, perhaps
to map the network. **[Although designed with redundancy in
mind]{.underline}**, the tapping or **[severing]{.underline}** of
**[undersea communication cables]{.underline}** **[could be extremely
consequential for]{.underline}** transatlantic and intra-European
**[communications]{.underline}**. If Russia or any other state could tap
into this network, it **[could covertly gain intelligence of strategic
importance]{.underline}**, for example on financial streams, trading
data, and classified military or government information. The
international trading and financial systems are critically dependent on
this network. A **[disruption]{.underline}** **[would have massive and
immediate effects on economic markets]{.underline}** (BBC, 2017;
Stavridis, 2018). As Keir Giles, a senior consulting fellow at Chatham
House has argued, **[Russia has learnt from its Crimea campaign:
"physical access to the communications infrastructure and
telecommunications]{.underline}**" **[was the key to information
dominance]{.underline}** (BBC, 2017).

20\. **[Currently]{.underline}**, **[no truly effective
systems]{.underline}** **[for monitoring undersea cable networks
exist]{.underline}** (Analytic Exchange Progam, 2017). Hence, **[a key
advantage of disrupting undersea cables]{.underline}** **[lies in
deniability]{.underline}**. A **[2008]{.underline}** incident
illustrates this. **[No bad actor was behind the near-simultaneous
cutting of undersea cables]{.underline}** from the Middle East to Europe
and Asia. A **[ship]{.underline}** **[dragging an anchor and an undersea
landslide were responsible]{.underline}**. However, **[if this happened
to cables crucial for the Allies,]{.underline}** **[how could they be
sure a state was behind this]{.underline}** (Smith and Hendrix, 2017)?
**[Even if one Ally had good intelligence,]{.underline}** **[would it be
able to share enough to convince others?]{.underline}** And **[what
would happen if this took place at critical points in
time?]{.underline}** One senior interlocutor during the recent STCTTS
visit to the United Kingdom said that **[Russia could lay mines near
these cables. If they were detonated]{.underline}** at the right time,
**[the Alliance could lose a war before it would even
start.]{.underline}** **[It is time for NATO to come up with a good
answer.]{.underline}**

### Uniq \-\-- Russia Will Cut

#### Moscow has the means and motives to attack cables -- fosters [espionage]{.underline} and disrupts [military planning]{.underline}.

**Morcos 21** -- Pierre Morcos is a visiting fellow in the Europe,
Russia, and Eurasia Program at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies, where he focuses on European security issues. A
career diplomat with the French Foreign Service, he most recently served
as deputy head of the Strategic Affairs and Cybersecurity Division,
focusing on NATO and European defense issues. Trained as a civil servant
in the National School for Administration (Ecole Nationale
d\'Administration), he holds a B.A. and an M.P.A. from the Paris
Institute of Political Studies (Sciences Po). (\"Invisible and Vital:
Undersea Cables and Transatlantic Security,\" CSIS, 6-11-2021,
https://www.csis.org/analysis/invisible-and-vital-undersea-cables-and-transatlantic-security,
Accessed 7-5-2022, LASA-SC)

Indeed, in recent years, **[Russian attention]{.underline}** **[to
transatlantic undersea cables]{.underline}**, particularly in the North
Atlantic Ocean, **[has increased]{.underline}**
**[commensurately]{.underline}** **[with NATO's perception of undersea
cables' importance and vulnerability]{.underline}**. **[Moscow
has]{.underline}** **[two]{.underline}** primary **[means]{.underline}**
**[by which it could directly threaten the cables: submarines and
surface vessels]{.underline}** **[that can deploy autonomous or manned
submersibles]{.underline}**. An example of the former was the Losharik
spy submarine, which---before a tragic fire in 2019 decommissioned
it---likely had the deep-sea capability necessary to map or destroy
undersea cables. **[While the Losharik is being repaired, the Russian
Navy has other such submarines and is developing unmanned undersea
drones, such as the nuclear-powered Poseidon]{.underline}**. As for
surface ships, the most famous is the Yantar, which is ostensibly a
research vessel but is understood to act as a spy ship that could deploy
underwater submersibles to attack and destroy sections of cables.

There are **[several conceivable objectives]{.underline}** **[severing a
cable might achieve:]{.underline}** **[cutting off
military]{.underline}** or government **[communications]{.underline}**
in the early stages of a conflict, **[eliminating internet
access]{.underline}** for a targeted population, **[sabotaging an
economic competitor]{.underline}**, **[or causing economic disruption
for geopolitical purposes]{.underline}**. Actors could also pursue
several or all of these objectives simultaneously.

**[More]{.underline}** difficult and **[subtle]{.underline}** than
destroying the cables **[is]{.underline}** **[tapping them to record,
copy, and steal data]{.underline}**, **[which would be later collected
and analyzed for espionage]{.underline}**. It is believed this could be
done in one of three ways: **[inserting backdoors during the cable
manufacturing process]{.underline}**, **[targeting onshore landing
stations and facilities linking cables to networks on
land]{.underline}**, **[or tapping the cables at sea]{.underline}**.
Each is more difficult than the one before, and the last---tapping the
cables at sea--- is believed to be so technically challenging that it is
not publicly known whether any country is even capable of it.

### Impacts \-\-- Cables Turn Econ/New Scenario

#### Cable cutting [collapses the economy]{.underline}\-\-- [submarine deterrence]{.underline} is key to solve

**BBC 17 ---** \"Could Russia cut undersea communication cables?,\" BBC
News, 12-15-2017, https://www.bbc.com/news/world-42365191, accessed
7-1-2022, WMK

The UK's top military officer has warned **[that Russia could strike a
\"catastrophic\" blow to the economy by targeting communications and
internet cables that run under the sea.]{.underline}**

Air Chief Marshal Sir Stuart Peach, the chief of the defence staff, said
the **[lines could potentially be cut or disrupted.]{.underline}**

The suggestion raises several questions:

Is that something Russia's likely to do?

What would happen if they - or someone else - did such a thing?

What do the cables do?

They provide internet and communications links between separate
countries and continents.

The full network of around 428 cables spans 683,508 miles (1.1 million
km), circling the globe.

Huge quantities of data fly around under the waves, in cables filled
with fibre optics - strands of glass as thin as a sheet of paper.

Unfortunately, **[while]{.underline}** their **[technology is
reliable]{.underline}**, **[these pivotal cables are physically
fragile.]{.underline}** The fibres are encased in steel wire and then
coasted in plastic - but many cables are still only around 3cm in
diameter.

Natural disasters can damage them and **[even a ship dropping anchor can
sever a cord]{.underline}**. That's happened before at the port of
Alexandria in Egypt, straining connections between Europe, Africa and
Asia.

Why are defence chiefs worried?

The BBC's defence correspondent, Jonathan Beale, says **[fears of Russia
cutting, disrupting or \"wire-tapping]{.underline}**\" **[undersea
communication lines are growing.]{.underline}**

**[Defence and intelligence chiefs cite the country's modernised
navy]{.underline}**, **[increased submarine activity and willingness to
use information warfare.]{.underline}**

**[Russian subs are increasingly present in the North
Atlantic,]{.underline}** **[particularly the GIUK Gap]{.underline}**, a
strip of ocean between Greenland, Iceland, and the UK.

Air Chief Marshal Peach is **[flagging up that]{.underline}** Britain
and its **[Nato]{.underline}** allies **[lack the subs,]{.underline}**
ships and aircraft to **[sustain constant vigilance.]{.underline}**

Our correspondent notes that the UK will get new Maritime Patrol
Aircraft within the next decade, but until then is **[reliant on Nato
support to spot subs.]{.underline}**

Nato's former top military chief, Admiral James G Stavridis, is also
concerned. \"We've **[allowed this vital infrastructure to grow
increasingly vulnerable]{.underline}** and **[this should worry us
all,\"]{.underline}** he said recently.

What would happen if the cables were cut?

Keir Giles, an expert in Russian information warfare who works with the
Chatham House think tank, stresses that this is not a new concern.

He thinks it's unlikely to happen as the economic fallout would also
affect Russia \"but it is definitely a scenario for which they are
practising\".

And if it did happen, **[the damage would be
considerable.]{.underline}**

\"The fact that people wouldn't be able to log on to Facebook would be
just a tiny, tiny aspect of all the disruption that would be caused if
these cables were interfered with,\" says Mr Giles.

\"**[International trading and financial transactions]{.underline}**
**[are managed across sub-sea cables]{.underline}**. The **[economic
impact would be enormous and immediate.\"]{.underline}**

He believes **[Russia is conflict-proofing itself]{.underline}**,
\"se**[eking to reduce its reliance on the correct functioning of the
interne]{.underline}**t by setting up its own parallel systems\", and
rehearsing for what would happen if its internet connection collapsed.

Russia is not the only nation with an interest in undersea cables.
During the Cold War, for example, the US attached a recording device to
a Soviet cable to learn more about the USSR's submarine and missile
capabilities.

However, Mr Giles says it's the only state \"with an intensive programme
looking at ways of isolating targets from information\".

Has Russia attempted to disrupt UK cables in the past? We can't be
sure - it's classified.

What's in it for Russia?

Information control, in short.

\"They are probing the vulnerabilities of civilian communications
infrastructure,\" Mr Giles says.

\"You can't see what they're doing underwater. You can see what they're
doing on land or with satellites.

\"What **[Russia learned]{.underline}** from Crimea is that in order to
take over communications for a target area you don't need expensive
cyber weapons, **[you don't need noisy and disruptive techniques like
denial of service attacks.]{.underline}**

\"All you need is **[physical access to the communications
infrastructure]{.underline}** and **[telecommunications expertise
embedded with your special forces.]{.underline}**

interdependent world, the shockwaves resulting from a major cable
disruption]{.underline}** at a leading financial centre such as London,
New York, Hong Kong, or Singapore **[are]{.underline}** potentially
**[catastrophic]{.underline}**. As Karl Rauscher (President Emeritus of
the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers and the author of
a major report on the risks associated with undersea cables) puts it:
"The **[impact of such a failure on international security and economic
stability could be devastating]{.underline}**\... **[It is unclear if
civilization can recover]{.underline}** **[from the failure of a
technology that has been so rapidly adopted without a backup
plan]{.underline}**\... Without (the network), **[the world's economic
financial market would immediately freeze]{.underline}**."ii Put simply,
if an adversary were to succeed in executing a successful attack against
Britain's undersea cable infrastructure **[the result would be financial
disaster on an unprecedented scale]{.underline}**. In the words of
Federal Reserve chief of staff Steve Malphrus: "**[When communications
networks go down, the financial services sector does not grind to a

Forced to choose sides, **[[governments]{.mark} may [face

**[[consequences]{.underline}]{.mark}**, as **[proxy disputes play out
[in]{.mark} control over]{.underline}** economic or geographic
resources. The deepening of **[[geopolitical fault
lines]{.underline}]{.mark}** and the lack of viable middle power
alternatives **[make it harder for countries to cultivate connective
tissue]{.underline}** **[with a diverse set of partner
countries]{.underline}** based on mutual values and maximizing
efficiencies. Instead, networks will become thick in some directions and
non-existent in others. The **[[COVID]{.underline}]{.mark}**-19 crisis

At the same time, without superpower referees or middle power
enforcement, **[global norms]{.underline}** may **[no longer govern

solidification of rival blocs as an opportunity to engage in regional
posturing, which will have destabilizing effects.24 Across societies,

restriction of movement and abrogation of rights.25

**[Economic crises will also amplify the challenges for middle
powers]{.underline}** as they navigate geopolitical competition.
**[ASEAN countries]{.underline}**, for example, had offered a potential
new manufacturing base as the United States and China decouple, but
**[the pandemic has left these countries strapped for cash to invest in
the necessary infrastructure and productive capacity]{.underline}**.26
**[[Economic fallout is pushing]{.mark} many [countries to debt
distress]{.mark}]{.underline}** (see Chapter 1, Global Risks 2021).
While G20 countries are supporting debt restructure for poorer
nations,27 **[[larger economies]{.mark} too [may]{.mark} be at risk of
[default]{.mark} in the longer term]{.underline}**;28 **[this would
leave them further stranded]{.underline}**---and unable to exercise

Multilateral meltdown

Middle power weaknesses will be reinforced in weakened institutions,
which may translate to more uncertainty and lagging progress on shared
global challenges such as climate change, health, poverty reduction and
technology governance. In the absence of strong regulating institutions,
[**[the Arctic and space]{.underline}** **[represent new realms
for]{.underline}** ]{.mark}**[potential [conflict]{.mark} as the
superpowers and middle powers alike compete to extract resources and
secure strategic advantage]{.underline}**.29 If the global superpowers
continue to accumulate economic, military and technological power **[in
a zero-sum playing field]{.underline}**, some middle powers could
increasingly fall behind. Without cooperation nor access to important
innovations, middle powers will struggle to define solutions to the
world's problems. In the long term, GRPS **[[respondents

# Mine Warfare Advantage

## Top Shelf

### 1AC \-\-- Mine Warfare ADv

#### NATO has the largest minesweeper fleet, but modernization is required

Andrea **Daolio 19**, Andrea Daolio, from Italy, has an engineering
background and a longstanding passion for wargaming and for
geopolitical, historical, and military topic, 10/21/19, "Meeting the
Mine Warfare Challenge with Unmanned Systems," CIMSEC,
https://cimsec.org/meeting-the-mine-warfare-challenge-with-unmanned-systems/

During World War II, Operation Starvation which mined Japanese home
waters severely disrupted Japanese maritime traffic and sunk more than
1.2 million tons of shipping for the loss of only 15 airplanes, while
demanding only 5.7 percent of the XXI Bomber Command's total sorties.
Yet a few years later the U.S. Navy was unprepared when it had to face
enemy mines itself in the Korean War, resulting in the delay of the
amphibious landing at Wonsan. At the end of the war, the mine
countermeasures forces, which accounted for less than two percent of all
UN naval forces, had suffered 20 percent of naval casualties.

The 1987-1988 and 1991-1992 Gulf crises once again showed how deadly
mines can be even for a totally superior force, damaging the USS Samuel
B. Roberts (FFG-58), the flagship for Airborne Mine Countermeasures
operations USS Tripoli (LPH-10) and the USS Princeton (CG-59). Since
World War II, mines have damaged or sunk four more times more US Navy
ships than all other weapons.[\
](https://cimsec.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Daolio-e1571428943683.jpg)**[These
events have been studied in detail by the Chinese People's Liberation
Army and other [potential adversaries]{.mark} of the U.S. [like Iran and
No]{.mark}rth [Ko]{.mark}rea, and all those nations [have significant
mine arsenals]{.mark}. China has a fleet of 33 mine warfare vessels and
over 50,000 mines]{.underline}** (some put the estimate as high as
80,000 or even 100,000), consisting of over 30 varieties of contact,
magnetic, acoustic, water pressure and mixed reaction sea mines, remote
control sea mines, rocket-rising and mobile mines.1

**[Russia has a fleet of 47 Mine Warfare vessels and inherited an
arsenal of "upwards of 250,000" mines from the Soviet Union, while
[Iran]{.mark} is [estimated]{.mark} to have [between 3,000 and
20,000]{.mark} mines and North Korea is said to have 50,000
mines]{.underline}**.2 As if these numbers were not threatening enough,
Iraq was able to damage two U.S. Navy ships by deploying only around
1,000 mines, many of them old types dating back to before World War I
that can be replicated cheaply (contact mines cost as little as \$1500)
even by third world nations. More than 30 countries produce and more
than 20 countries export mines, and even highly sophisticated versions
of the weapon are available in the international arms trade.

**[[NATO]{.mark} on the other hand [has the largest MCM fleet]{.mark} in
the world with 149 ships (as of 2016), [but those ships are]{.mark}
becoming [old and obsolete]{.mark} (many are [second-hand vessels
retired by their original owner and then sold to smaller NATO
countries]{.mark}). And only 7 percent of these vessels are part of the
U.S. Navy. [The need to renovate and enlarge this force is immediately
apparent]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

#### AI submarines solve minesweeping, minelaying, and avoidable collisions; they cost less too

Mehak **Dhiman 21**, Dihman is a student at the Jindal School of
International Affairs and Research Intern at the Centre for Security

**[Integration of [AI]{.mark} in navy [will help in developing]{.mark}
new offensive ships and [submarines]{.mark} [which]{.mark} will be able
to [perform various functions]{.mark} at once]{.underline}**. This will
not only result in more deadly attacks but will also save on the number
of ships and manpower required to carry out such tasks separately on
separate ships and separate locations. One such unmanned submersible is
the one recently acquired by the US Navy, based on Boeing's Echo Voyager
prototype UUV Orca Extra Large Unmanned Undersea Vehicles (XLUUVs).

This is a 15.5m long submersible which offers a range of 6,500 nautical
miles and numerous months of operation on a single fuel module. It uses
a Kalman filtered inertial navigation unit aided by a set of doppler
velocity logs, and depth sensors to navigate underwater since it can
only use GPS at the surface. **[This is a [multi-functional]{.mark},
offensive undersea [vehicle]{.mark} which [can indulge in mine]{.mark}
[countermeasures]{.mark}, anti-[submarine warfare]{.mark}, anti-surface
warfare, electronic warfare and strike missions.]{.underline}** It was
also put to test. Ocean testing tasks included charging the battery,
controlling the vehicle in currents and wave action, submerging the
vehicle and returning to the surface. Echo Voyager returned to sea in
2018 through early this year for Bravo sea trials, designed to expand
the operational envelope from the initial test series." a Boeing
spokesperson said.

**[The [current system]{.mark} of navigating in water [has proven to be
very problematic]{.mark} for the department of navy and has [also been
heavy on the capital]{.mark} resources [due to the number of avoidable
collisions]{.mark}.]{.underline}** **[These [incidents]{.mark} can be
[checked by deploying AI for such tasks]{.mark} which will make
navigation reliable and efficient]{.underline}**. It will help in
detecting obstacles in unfavorable conditions and from a great distance.
This will also give more time for maneuvering past the object without
putting too much pressure on the sailor. Sea Hunter is one such
autonomous ship procured by the US Navy which performs most of its
functions without human interference. The most surprising part about
this ship is its completely autonomous navigation system. Sea Hunter
became the first ship to autonomously navigate from San Diego to Pearl
Harbor, Hawaii, and back without a single crew member aboard and without
any major collision.

The Sea Hunter is the first entirely unmanned sea voyager. It was
engineered by Reston, Va.- based Leidos. They say that it is
**[[navigated]{.mark} [by]{.mark} a specially designed artificial
intelligence ([AI]{.mark}), which assimilates the required data from
sensors, radars and AI cameras installed on the vessel. It can be on its
own for weeks while [perform]{.mark}ing various [functions like tracking
enemy submarines, removing mines, detecting torpedoes]{.mark} and acting
as a communication relay. Like any other AI based autonomous naval
vehicle this ship [also costs way less than fully manned
ships]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Operating Sea Hunter costs \$20,000 a day,
which is 35 times less than the daily running costs of an Arleigh
Burke-class destroyer (\$700,000).

**[[Threat detection]{.mark} in navy usually involves spotting static as
well as moving objects in the route finalized for carrying out any task.
This further [helps]{.mark} in navigating efficiently and [avoiding
collisions]{.mark} and unwanted confrontations [and encounters with
underwater mines]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In a research conducted by
Albert Michael we see how pre-processing and minimum risk routes have
been combined to navigate aircraft carriers for a successful flight.

\"unsafe\" encounter amid soaring nuclear tension", Navy Times

**[A U.S. [Navy warship fired]{.mark} a [warning flare to wave off an
Iranian]{.mark} Revolutionary Guard [speedboat]{.mark} coming straight
at it during a tense [encounter]{.mark} in the strategic Strait of
Hormuz]{.underline}**, officials said Tuesday. The incident on Monday
involving the Guard and the **[Navy [comes as tensions remain high over
stalled negotiations
over]{.mark} [Iran](https://www.cbsnews.com/us-iran-tensions/)\'s
[tattered nuclear deal]{.mark}]{.underline}** with world powers and as
Tehran [enriches uranium closer than ever to
weapons-grade](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/iran-news-nuclear-deal-iaea-grossi-tehran-removes-cameras-fatal-blow/) levels
under decreasing international oversight.

**[Meanwhile, the [U]{.mark}nited [N]{.mark}ations\' nuclear watchdog
[said Iran now plans to enrich uranium]{.mark} through a second set of
advanced centrifuges]{.underline}** at its underground Fordo facility
amid the standoff.

The Cyclone-class patrol ship USS Sirocco and Spearhead-class
expeditionary fast transport USNS Choctaw County found themselves in the
close encounter with three Iranian fast boats while coming through the
Strait of Hormuz to enter the Persian Gulf, the Navy said.

In a video released by the Navy\'s Bahrain-based 5th Fleet, a high-speed
Guard Boghammar is seen turning head-on toward the Sirocco. The Sirocco
repeatedly blows its horn at the Boghammar, which turns away as it
closes in. **[The flare shot can be heard, but not seen, as the
Boghammar passes the Sirocco with the Iranian flag flying above
it]{.underline}**.

The Navy said the Boghammar came within 50 yards of the Sirocco, raising
the risk of the vessels running into each other. The overall encounter
lasted about an hour, the Navy said.

**[The [Guard\'s \"actions did not meet international standards of
professional or safe maritime behavior]{.mark},]{.underline}**
increasing the risk of miscalculation and collision,\" the Navy said.

**[[Iran did not]{.mark} immediately [acknowledge the incident]{.mark}
in the strategic waterway --- a [fifth of all traded oil passes through
the strait.]{.mark} The Navy separately told The Associated Press that
this marked the second so-called \"unsafe and unprofessional\"
incident]{.underline}** it had with Iran in recent months.

#### Iran escalating in the Strait of Hormuz with mines poses a major threat to American ships in the Gulf; only a comprehensive strategy to remove the mines solves

**[[Creating new routes for its oil exports]{.mark} may [offer Iran
escalatory options in the Strait of Hormuz]{.mark}]{.underline}**. But
would Iran take such a step? **[Such an Iranian naval offensive would
represent a serious provocation]{.underline}** --- the most direct
confrontation yet between Washington and Tehran. Some may question
whether Iran would really choose to go this route. Hypothetically, **[we
assume they may cite the resources necessary to build out Rouhani's
plan, at a time when [Iran is under increasing economic pressure]{.mark}
and facing political challenges in an upcoming domestic election
cycle]{.underline}**. Or the fact that the recent energy market crash
coupled with the pandemic crisis make such an expensive undertaking not
cost effective for Iran's oil exporting program. While all are
reasonable points for debate, these counter-arguments miss the point of
Iran's moves. **[Because [the Strait of Hormuz plays both]{.mark}
important [practical and symbolic roles in the region, advancing Iranian
capabilities to disrupt the]{.mark} waterway [is a real deterrence
tool]{.mark}, and a means by which to pressure neighbors as well as the
United States and those aligned with it]{.underline}**. **[[The credible
threat that Iran could shut down the strait]{.mark} now [is backed
by]{.mark} its increasingly effective and multi-layered [arsenal of
water and limpet mines]{.mark},]{.underline}** fast and attack boats,
drone boats, anti-ship missiles, coastal defense**[, and
submarines.]{.underline}**

So, Iran may have increasing capabilities to conduct more aggressive
operations in the strait. But who would risk making the decision to go
ahead with it? **[On paper, the two Iranian navies still share the
Strait of Hormuz as an area of responsibility]{.underline}**. But in
practice, the Guards have the upper hand there. And in addition to being
better funded and equipped than the traditional Iranian navy, the
Revolutionary Guards are also more aggressive than their conventional
counterparts. The Revolutionary Guards navy will continue to employ an
asymmetric doctrine when deciding how its naval assets are used. The
objective is not naval superiority, but rather the bread and butter of
the Guards' operations: a mix of lower cost, sometimes proxy-executed,
asymmetric tactics that can cause pain, sow concern, and build leverage.

**[Meanwhile, [the U.S. Navy's fleet of minesweepers
is [aging](https://www.propublica.org/article/iran-has-hundreds-of-naval-mines-us-navy-minesweepers-find-old-dishwashers-car-parts)]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
As Pro
Publica [reported](https://www.propublica.org/article/iran-has-hundreds-of-naval-mines-us-navy-minesweepers-find-old-dishwashers-car-parts) in
2019, "**[[the sonar meant to detect mines was so imprecise]{.mark} that
in training exercises [it flagged dishwashers]{.mark}, crab traps and
cars on the ocean floor as potential bombs]{.underline}**." The U.S.
Navy has
rightly[ prioritized](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/weapons/RL32665.pdf) increased
readiness and force upgrades across the fleet. **[Recent [budget
cycles](https://armedservices.house.gov/_cache/files/4/c/4c91c1c0-d977-46bb-9a4b-3c0d4775ffbb/35D45A722F7BFAD3E36A9B95A88F6809.fy21-ndaa-chairman-s-mark-summary-vfinal.pdf) support
that initiative but the debate over the what systems to upgrade and how
much to invest is not over, [the time horizon for the initiative is
long]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and a key focus remains on tools to address
great power competition --- specifically in the Pacific. **[The Navy's
serious undertaking is not aided by distractions]{.underline}** from
President Trump and his administration, commenting on[ naval rules of
engagement](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-05-03/trump-s-dangerously-wrong-about-destroying-iranian-speedboats),

Finally, the uneven responses to Iranian provocations last year
culminating in the killing of Guards Commander Qassem Soleimani have
reinforced the unpredictability of U.S. staying power. All these
elements likely factor into Iran's calculus. **[Its new comprehensive

the Rouhani government's "most strategic plan," might produce a new
lever Iran may plan to use in its favor in the Persian Gulf.

**[[Iran's plan]{.mark} to set the conditions that [would allow for
effectively closing the Strait of Hormuz]{.mark} has been lost in a busy
news cycle in the United States]{.underline}**. But its implications, if
implemented, are likely to reverberate for years to come, **[including
[drawing China]{.mark} further into the region]{.underline}**. As the
United States continues to send mixed signals about its strategy and
presence in the Middle East and the U.S. Navy rightly continues to shift
its attention and resources to the Pacific, **[[Iran is building its
capabilities]{.mark} and [signaling]{.mark} its [intention]{.mark} [to
consider adopting a more aggressive posture in the Persian Gulf and Gulf
of Oman.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**[[Without a clear and comprehensive strategy towards Iran in
particular]{.mark} and the region in general, the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [risks]{.mark} perpetuating an "either/or" [debate about
its interests]{.mark} in the Middle East]{.underline}** while not
planning for and managing for evolving threats. Developing plans to
assess Iran's intentions in the Strait of Hormuz and wider Persian Gulf
does not mean the United States, or its military, will become dragged
deeper into the region. But effective management would begin by putting
this development in the proper context of a pattern of escalation with
Iran, isolation from allies on Iran policy, and the lack of any
diplomatic efforts to de-escalate increasing tensions across the board
with Iran. **[[Without this broader analysis]{.mark}, diplomatic effort,
and military planning combined, [America's Iran strategy will continue
to fall short.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**[Last week, an [oil tanker]{.mark} traveling through the Gulf of Oman
[was [struck](https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/israeli-ship-attacked-in-gulf-of-oman-report-675389)]{.mark} by
a suspected kamikaze drone, killing two crew members]{.underline}**. And
yesterday, several vessels traveling through the nearby Strait of Hormuz
reported sudden emergencies, while another
was [boarded](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-58083671) by
operatives suspected of being Iranian troops. **[A terrible situation
for all affected, to be sure. But the rest of us should be concerned
too.]{.underline}**

**[[Global shipping is extraordinarily efficient]{.mark}, managing to
transport [80
percent](https://unctad.org/webflyer/review-maritime-transport-2018) of
global trade so reliably that consumers take it for
granted]{.underline}**. As the Mercer Street vessel's misfortune
demonstrates, though, shipping is also highly vulnerable to disruptions.
And increased maritime aggression stands to harm ordinary consumers as
well.

The U.S., U.K. and Israeli governments all [blame
Iran](https://apnews.com/article/middle-east-business-iran-persian-gulf-tensions-419efc522acbd213a79696c9876af6dc) for
the Gulf of Oman attack, saying they are [certain of the country's
guilt](https://apnews.com/article/middle-east-business-iran-persian-gulf-tensions-419efc522acbd213a79696c9876af6dc) regarding
events on the Liberian-flagged vessel, which is owned by a Japanese firm
and managed by a U.K. company belonging to Israeli billionaire Eyal
Ofer**[. [Iran has]{.mark} [denied striking the Mercer Street]{.mark}
and no footage of the incident has been released, [but most shipping
analysts suspect the country]{.mark} as well.]{.underline}**

Yesterday, another tanker, the Panama-flagged Asphalt Princess,
was [reported](https://www.reuters.com/article/shipping-security-emirates-seizure-idUSL8N2PA6EE) to
have been boarded by armed men, thought to be Iranian operatives, in the
Strait of Hormuz, while other cargo ships also reported sudden steering
problems.

**["[This is a shadow conflict between Iran and Israel]{.mark}, where
[shipping]{.mark} has been [caught in the middle]{.mark}," said Cormac
McGarry,]{.underline}** a maritime analyst with the global risk
consultancy Control Risks, referring to the Mercer Street.

"You can attack a Japanese-owned, Liberian-flagged vessel simply because
it's linked to an Israeli billionaire. It's a very useful way of
launching deniable attacks that don't directly target your adversary,"
he added.

**[Indeed, the alleged attack on the Mercer Street and these suspected
new attacks are only the latest incidents involving cargo
ships]{.underline}** traveling through the Gulf of Oman and its twin,
the Strait of Hormuz.

**[The Gulf of Oman and the [Strait of Hormuz]{.mark}, [through which
vast quantities of oil and other essential goods travel, form a vital
artery of the globalized economy]{.mark}, with several dozen cargo
vessels owned by a range of companies, many in Western
countries]{.underline}**, and carrying flags ranging from the
Philippines and Liberia [traversing its
waters](https://www.marinevesseltraffic.com/HORMUZ-STRAIT/ship-traffic-tracker?full_screen=yes&map=dual) at
any given time.

As the shadow wars between Iran and Israel and Iran and Saudi Arabia
intensify, **[those [commercial vessels]{.mark} --- [without
whose]{.mark} [cargo]{.mark}, [companies around the world would have to
cease operations]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[--- [face the risk of being
harmed]{.mark} simply [because of their affiliation with a particular
country]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

In the past couple of years, Israel is thought to have used mines
to [attack](https://www.wsj.com/articles/israel-strikes-target-iranian-oil-bound-for-syria-11615492789) several
Iranian tankers transporting oil to Syria, while a range of attacks
thought to have been perpetrated by Iran have targeted ships linked to
Israel.

**["Lots of things happen in the Gulf of Oman," said Simon Lockwood, a
maritime expert with the global insurance broker Willis Towers
Watson.]{.underline}** "This is the fourth incident in a short time
involving an Israel-affiliated vessel."

For example, two years ago, the Stena Impero was thought to have been
seized by Iran's Revolutionary Guards not because of any serious
maritime infractions but as an apparent proxy for the U.K., which itself
had [seized an Iranian
tanker](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/04/royal-marines-gibraltar-tanker-oil-syria-eu-sanctions) suspected
of breaching EU sanctions on Syria a short time earlier.

**[Ships are set up to transport goods and, these days, also
rudimentarily defend themselves against pirate]{.underline}**s --- which
is why the Mercer Street had a security guard on board. However, they're
not set up to defend themselves against hostile-state attacks.

"**[[If Iran wanted to cause serious supply chain disruptions, it could
escalate]{.mark} these attacks [in the Strait of
Hormuz]{.mark}]{.underline}**," McGarry said.

A century later, Russia became aggressive under similar circumstances.

#### Scenario #2: China

#### China will invade Taiwan now; Ukraine has set the stage and draws in Russia

Enrico **Colombatto 22**, Enrico Colombatto is a professor of economics
at the University of Turin, Italy; he is also director of research at
the Institut de Recherches Economiques et Fiscales (IREF) in Paris,
5/12/22, "Taiwan: Scenarios for an invasion from China," *GIS*,
<https://www.gisreportsonline.com/r/china-taiwan-invasion/>, JH

**[The [Russian invasion of Ukraine]{.mark} has [shown]{.mark} that the
quest for personal prestige]{.underline}**, historical nostalgia and
beliefs in national myths still play a role in shaping international
politics. **[The economy is important, of course, but it is only part of
the story in some cases. Indeed, [Taiwan may be another victim of the
rhetoric of "reunification]{.mark} with the motherland" and Beijing's
need to boost its image with the illusion of an easy gain on the
international stage]{.underline}**. 

Some speculate that Russian President
Vladimir [Putin](https://www.gisreportsonline.com/r/containing-russia/)'s
blunder in Ukraine will make mainland China more cautious. As Ukraine
has taught the Russians, reunification is not always welcome -- spoiling
the aggressor's plans to present the world with a fait accompli before
reactions and countermeasures take force.

**[There are important differences, however, between Ukraine and
Taiwan]{.underline}**. The world has recognized Ukraine as an
independent nation since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, while
**[many nations]{.underline}** **[do not support Taiwan's
independence]{.underline}** and recognize the [People's Republic of
China](https://english.www.gov.cn/) as the sole legal government of
China.

**[One may also argue that [Beijing]{.mark} might be [encouraged to take
advantage of the West's]{.mark} [preoccupation]{.mark} with Eastern
Europe and possibly reluctance to oppose Russia and China
simultaneously.]{.underline}** In this light, of course, **[[ongoing
tensions in Ukraine]{.mark} would [justify]{.mark} a [deal between
Russia and China]{.mark} to allow Russia to circumvent Western sanctions
[and set the stage for China's possible invasion of
Taiwan]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**[The current global situation will soon hit the well-performing
Taiwanese economy]{.underline}**. Thanks to its free-market approach,
Taiwan is a success story. It features an impressive growth record and
low inflation (the government predicts 2 percent in 2022, up from 1.6
percent in 2021). Taiwan is a world player in electronics (microchips),
a significant machinery exporter and a major destination for high-tech
foreign direct investments. 

**[For the Taiwanese, [heightened tensions threaten]{.mark} its [robust
trade with]{.mark} mainland [China]{.mark} and Hong Kong, which absorb
about 50 percent of the island's exports]{.underline}**. A political
crisis will force the Taiwanese to direct more resources to the defense
industry, while future investments by domestic and international actors
will be threatened. **[Growth can suffer. In short, independence is
expensive even without overt aggression. ]{.underline}**

#### That war goes nuclear because Chinese nuclear and conventional forces are intermingled

**[As China's power has grown]{.underline}** in recent years,
**[so]{.underline}**, **[too]{.underline}**, **[has the risk of war with
the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates.
**[Under]{.underline}** President **[Xi]{.underline}** Jinping,
**[[China has increased]{.mark} its]{.underline}** political and
economic **[[pressure on Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark}** and built
military installations on coral reefs in the South China Sea, **[fueling
Washington's fears that Chinese expansionism will threaten U.S. allies
and influence]{.underline}** in the region. **[U.S. destroyers have
transited the Taiwan Strait]{.underline}**, **[to loud protests from
Beijing]{.underline}**. American policymakers have wondered aloud
whether they should send an aircraft carrier through the strait as well.
Chinese fighter jets have intercepted U.S. aircraft in the skies above
the South China Sea. **[Meanwhile]{.underline}**, U.S. President Donald
**[Trump has brought]{.underline}** long-simmering **[economic disputes
to a rolling boil]{.underline}**. A war between the two countries
remains unlikely, but **[the prospect of a [military
confrontation]{.mark}]{.underline}**---**[resulting]{.underline}**, for
example, [**[from]{.underline}** **[a Chinese campaign against
Taiwan]{.underline}**]{.mark}---**[no longer
[seems]{.mark}]{.underline}** as **[im[plausible]{.mark}]{.underline}**
as it once did. And **[the odds of such a confrontation going
nuclear]{.underline}** **[are higher]{.underline}** **[than
most]{.underline}** policymakers and analysts **[think]{.underline}**.
Members of China's strategic community tend to dismiss such concerns.
Likewise, U.S. studies of a potential war with China often exclude
nuclear weapons from the analysis entirely, treating them as basically
irrelevant to the course of a conflict. Asked about the issue in 2015,
Dennis Blair, the former commander of U.S. forces in the Indo-Pacific,
estimated the likelihood of a U.S.-Chinese nuclear crisis as "somewhere
between nil and zero." This assurance is misguided. **[If deployed
against China]{.underline}**, the Pentagon's preferred style of
**[conventional warfare would be a]{.underline}** potential **[recipe
for nuclear escalation]{.underline}**. Since the end of the Cold War,
the United States' signature approach to war has been simple: punch deep
into enemy territory in order to rapidly knock out the opponent's key
military assets at minimal cost. But the Pentagon developed this formula
in wars against Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and Serbia, none of which was
a nuclear power. **[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}**, by contrast, not only
**[[has nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark}]{.underline}**; it has also
**[[intermingled]{.underline}]{.mark}** them **[[with its
conventional]{.mark} military [forces]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, **[making
it difficult to attack one without]{.underline}**]{.mark} attacking
**[[the other]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[This means that
a]{.underline}** major U.S. **[military campaign]{.underline}**
**[targeting China's]{.underline}** **[conventional
forces]{.underline}** **[would]{.underline}** likely **[also threaten
its nuclear arsenal]{.underline}**. **[Faced with such a
threat]{.underline}**, Chinese **[leaders could decide to
use]{.underline}** their **[nuclear weapons]{.underline}** while they
were still able to. As U.S. and Chinese **[leaders navigate a
relationship fraught with mutual suspicion]{.underline}**, they must
come to grips with the fact that a **[conventional war could skid into a
nuclear confrontation]{.underline}**. Although this risk is not high in
absolute terms, its **[consequences]{.underline}** for the region and
the world **[would be devastating]{.underline}**. **[As long as the
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[and China continue to
pursue their current]{.underline}** grand **[strategies]{.underline}**,
**[the risk is likely to endure]{.underline}**. This means that leaders
on both sides should dispense with the illusion that they can easily
fight a limited war. They should focus instead on managing or resolving
the political, economic, and military tensions that might lead to a
conflict in the first place. A NEW KIND OF THREAT There are some reasons
for optimism. For one, China has long stood out for its nonaggressive
nuclear doctrine. After its first nuclear test, in 1964, China largely
avoided the Cold War arms race, building a much smaller and simpler
nuclear arsenal than its resources would have allowed. Chinese leaders
have consistently characterized nuclear weapons as useful only for
deterring nuclear aggression and coercion. Historically, this narrow
purpose required only a handful of nuclear weapons that could ensure
Chinese retaliation in the event of an attack. To this day, China
maintains a "no first use" pledge, promising that it will never be the
first to use nuclear weapons. The prospect of a nuclear conflict can
also seem like a relic of the Cold War. Back then, the United States and
its allies lived in fear of a Warsaw Pact offensive rapidly overrunning
Europe. NATO stood ready to use nuclear weapons first to stalemate such
an attack. Both Washington and Moscow also consistently worried that
their nuclear forces could be taken out in a bolt-from-the-blue nuclear
strike by the other side. This mutual fear increased the risk that one
superpower might rush to launch in the erroneous belief that it was
already under attack. Initially, the danger of unauthorized strikes also
loomed large. In the 1950s, lax safety procedures for U.S. nuclear
weapons stationed on NATO soil, as well as minimal civilian oversight of
U.S. military commanders, raised a serious risk that nuclear escalation
could have occurred without explicit orders from the U.S. president. The
good news is that these Cold War worries have little bearing on
U.S.-Chinese relations today. Neither country could rapidly overrun the
other's territory in a conventional war. Neither seems worried about a
nuclear bolt from the blue. And civilian political control of nuclear
weapons is relatively strong in both countries. What remains, in theory,
is the comforting logic of mutual deterrence: in a war between two
nuclear powers, neither side will launch a nuclear strike for fear that
its enemy will respond in kind. The bad news is that
**[one]{.underline}** other **[trigger remains]{.underline}**: **[a
conventional war that threatens China's nuclear arsenal]{.underline}**.
**[[Conventional forces]{.mark} can threaten nuclear forces in ways that
[generate pressures to escalate]{.mark}]{.underline}**---**[especially

[viable]{.mark} option]{.underline}** to defend itself. STRAIT SHOOTERS
**[[The most worrisome flash point]{.underline}]{.mark}** for a
U.S.-Chinese war **[[is Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
**[Beijing's]{.underline}** long-term **[objective of reunifying the
island with mainland China is]{.underline}** clearly **[in conflict with
Washington's]{.underline}** longstanding **[desire to maintain the
status quo in the strait]{.underline}**. It is not difficult to imagine
how **[this might lead to war]{.underline}**. For example, **[[China
could decide that the]{.underline}]{.mark}** political or military
**[[window for]{.mark} regaining [control]{.mark}]{.underline}** over
the island **[[was closing and]{.mark} launch an
[attack]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[[using air]{.underline}]{.mark}** and
naval **[[forces to blockade Taiwanese harbors or bombard]{.mark} the
[island]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Although U.S. law does not require
Washington to intervene in such a scenario, the Taiwan Relations Act
states that the United States will "consider any effort to determine the
future of Taiwan by other than peaceful means, including by boycotts or
embargoes, a threat to the peace and security of the Western Pacific
area and of grave concern to the United States." **[Were Washington to
intervene on Taipei's behalf]{.underline}**, **[the world's sole
superpower and its rising competitor would find themselves
in]{.underline}** the first **[great-power war]{.underline}** of the
twenty-first century. **[In the course of such a war]{.underline}**,
**[U.S. conventional military operations would likely
threaten]{.underline}**, disable, or outright eliminate some **[Chinese
nuclear capabilities]{.underline}**---whether doing so was Washington's
stated objective or not. In fact, if the United States engaged in the
style of warfare it has practiced over the last 30 years, **[this
outcome would be all but guaranteed]{.underline}**. Consider submarine
warfare. **[[China could use its]{.underline}]{.mark}** conventionally
armed attack **[[sub]{.mark}marine[s]{.mark} [to blockade Taiwanese
harbors]{.mark}]{.underline}** or bomb the island, **[[or]{.mark} to
[attack]{.mark} [U.S]{.mark}.]{.underline}** and allied
**[[forces]{.mark} in the region]{.underline}**. **[If that
happened]{.underline}**, **[the [U.S.]{.mark} Navy would]{.underline}**
almost certainly **[undertake an [antisubmarine
campaign]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[which would likely threaten
China's]{.underline}** "boomers," the four **[nuclear-armed ballistic
missile submarines]{.underline}** that form its naval nuclear deterrent.
**[China's]{.underline}** conventionally armed and nuclear-armed
**[submarines share the same]{.underline}** shore-based
**[communications system]{.underline}**; **[a U.S. attack]{.underline}**
**[on]{.underline}** these **[transmitters]{.underline}** would thus not
only disrupt the activities of China's attack submarine force but also
**[[cut off its boomers]{.mark} from contact]{.underline}** with
Beijing, **[[leaving Chinese leaders unsure]{.mark} of the fate of their
naval nuclear force]{.underline}**. In addition, nuclear ballistic
missile submarines depend on attack submarines for protection, just as
lumbering bomber aircraft rely on nimble fighter jets. If the United
States started sinking Chinese attack submarines, it would be sinking
the very force that protects China's ballistic missile submarines,
leaving the latter dramatically more vulnerable. Even more dangerous,
**[U.S. forces]{.underline}** hunting Chinese attack submarines **[could
inadvertently sink a Chinese boomer]{.underline}** instead. After all,
at least some Chinese attack submarines might be escorting ballistic
missile submarines, especially in wartime, when China might flush its
boomers from their ports and try to send them within range of the
continental United States. Since correctly identifying targets remains
one of the trickiest challenges of undersea warfare, a U.S. submarine
crew might come within shooting range of a Chinese submarine without
being sure of its type, especially in a crowded, noisy environment like
the Taiwan Strait. Platitudes about caution are easy in peacetime. In
wartime, when Chinese attack submarines might already have launched
deadly strikes, the U.S. crew might decide to shoot first and ask
questions later. **[[Adding to China's sense of
vulnerability]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[the small size of its
nuclear]{.underline}**-**[armed submarine force means that just
two]{.underline}** such **[incidents would eliminate half of
its]{.underline}** **[sea-based deterrent]{.underline}**. Meanwhile, any
Chinese **[boomers that escaped this fate would]{.underline}** likely
**[be cut off from communication]{.underline}** with onshore commanders,
left without an escort force, and unable to return to destroyed ports.
If that happened, **[China would essentially have no naval nuclear
deterrent]{.underline}**. The situation is similar onshore, where any
U.S. military campaign would have to contend with China's growing
land-based conventional ballistic missile force. Much of this force is
within range of Taiwan, ready to launch ballistic missiles against the
island or at any allies coming to its aid. Once again, U.S.
**[victory]{.underline}** would hinge on the ability to degrade this
conventional ballistic missile force. And once again, it **[would be
virtually impossible]{.underline}** to do so **[while leaving China's
nuclear ballistic missile force unscathed]{.underline}**. **[Chinese
conventional and nuclear ballistic missiles are]{.underline}** often
**[attached to the same base headquarters]{.underline}**, meaning that
**[they]{.underline}** likely **[share transportation and supply
networks]{.underline}**, **[patrol routes]{.underline}**, **[and other
supporting infrastructure]{.underline}**. It is also possible that they
share some command-and-control networks, or that the United States would
be unable to distinguish between the conventional and nuclear networks
even if they were physically separate. To add to the challenge, some of
China's ballistic missiles can carry either a conventional or a nuclear
warhead, and the two versions are virtually indistinguishable to U.S.
aerial surveillance. In a war, targeting the conventional variants would
likely mean destroying some nuclear ones in the process. Furthermore,
**[sending manned aircraft to attack Chinese missile launch
sites]{.underline}** and bases **[would require]{.underline}** at least
**[partial control of the airspace over China]{.underline}**,
**[which]{.underline}** in turn **[would require weakening Chinese air
defenses]{.underline}**. But degrading **[China's coastal air defense
network]{.underline}** in order to fight a conventional war
**[would]{.underline}** also **[leave much of its nuclear force without
protection]{.underline}**. Once China was under attack, its leaders
might come to fear that even intercontinental ballistic missiles located
deep in the country's interior were vulnerable. For years, observers
have pointed to the U.S. military's failed attempts to locate and
destroy Iraqi Scud missiles during the 1990--91 Gulf War as evidence
that mobile missiles are virtually impervious to attack. Therefore, the
thinking goes, China could retain a nuclear deterrent no matter what
harm U.S. forces inflicted on its coastal areas. Yet recent research
suggests otherwise. **[Chinese intercontinental ballistic
missiles]{.underline}** are **[larger and less mobile
than]{.underline}** the **[Iraqi Scuds]{.underline}** were, and they are
harder to move without detection. **[The U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[is]{.underline}** also **[likely to have
been tracking them]{.underline}** much more closely in peacetime. As a
result, China is unlikely to view a failed Scud hunt in Iraq nearly 30
years ago as reassurance that its residual nuclear force is safe today,
especially during an ongoing, high-intensity conventional war. China's
vehement criticism of a U.S. regional missile defense system designed to
guard against a potential North Korean attack already reflects these
latent fears. Beijing's worry is that this system could help Washington
block the handful of missiles China might launch in the aftermath of a
U.S. attack on its arsenal. That sort of campaign might seem much more
plausible in Beijing's eyes if a conventional war had already begun to
seriously undermine other parts of China's nuclear deterrent. It does
not help that China's real-time awareness of the state of its forces
would probably be limited, since blinding the adversary is a standard
part of the U.S. military playbook. Put simply, **[the [favored U.S.
strategy]{.mark} to ensure a conventional victory
[would]{.mark}]{.underline}** likely **[[endanger]{.underline}]{.mark}**
much of **[China's [nuclear arsenal]{.mark}]{.underline}** in the
process, at sea and on land. **[Whether the United States actually
intended to target]{.underline}** all of China's nuclear **[weapons
would be incidental]{.underline}**. **[All that would matter is that
Chinese leaders would consider them threatened]{.underline}**. LESSONS
FROM THE PAST At that point, the question becomes, How will China react?
Will it practice restraint and uphold the "no first use" pledge once its
nuclear forces appear to be under attack? Or will it use those weapons
while it still can, gambling that limited escalation will either halt
the U.S. campaign or intimidate Washington into backing down? Chinese
writings and statements remain deliberately ambiguous on this point. It
is unclear which exact set of capabilities China considers part of its
core nuclear deterrent and which it considers less crucial. For example,
if China already recognizes that its sea-based nuclear deterrent is
relatively small and weak, then losing some of its ballistic missile
submarines in a war might not prompt any radical discontinuity in its
calculus. The danger lies in **[[wartime
developments]{.underline}]{.mark}** that **[[could shift China's
assumptions about U.S. intentions]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[If
[Beijing]{.mark} interprets the erosion]{.underline}** of its sea- and
land-based **[nuclear forces as a deliberate effort]{.underline}** to
destroy its nuclear deterrent, or perhaps even as a prelude to a nuclear
attack, **[it [might see]{.mark} limited [nuclear escalation as a way
to]{.mark} force an [end]{.mark} to [the
conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}**. For example, **[[China could use
nuclear weapons to]{.underline}]{.mark}** instantaneously
**[[destroy]{.mark} the [U.S. air bases]{.mark} that posed the biggest
threat to its arsenal]{.underline}**. **[It could also launch a nuclear
strike with no]{.underline}** direct **[military
purpose]{.underline}**---on an unpopulated area or at sea---**[as a way
to signal that the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[had
crossed a redline]{.underline}**. [**[If such escalation appears
far-fetched]{.underline}**, **[China's history suggests
otherwise]{.underline}**]{.mark}. **[In 1969]{.underline}**, **[similar
dynamics]{.underline}** **[brought China to the brink of nuclear war
with the Soviet Union]{.underline}**. In early March of that year,
Chinese troops ambushed Soviet guards amid rising tensions over a
disputed border area. Less than two weeks later, the two countries were
fighting an undeclared border war with heavy artillery and aircraft.
**[The conflict quickly escalated beyond what Chinese
leaders]{.underline}** had **[expected]{.underline}**, **[and before the
end of March]{.underline}**, **[Moscow was making thinly veiled nuclear
threats]{.underline}** to pressure China to back down. Chinese leaders
initially dismissed these warnings, only to radically upgrade their
threat assessment once they learned that the Soviets had privately
discussed nuclear attack plans with other countries. Moscow never
intended to follow through on its nuclear threat, archives would later
reveal, but Chinese leaders believed otherwise. On three separate
occasions, they were convinced that a Soviet nuclear attack was
imminent. Once, when Moscow sent representatives to talks in Beijing,
China suspected that the plane transporting the delegation was in fact
carrying nuclear weapons. **[Increasingly fearful]{.underline}**,
**[China test-fired a thermonuclear weapon]{.underline}** in the Lop Nur
desert **[and put its rudimentary nuclear forces on
alert]{.underline}**---a dangerous step in itself, as it increased the
risk of an unauthorized or accidental launch. Only after numerous
preparations for Soviet nuclear attacks that never came did Beijing
finally agree to negotiations. China is a different country today than
it was in the time of Mao Zedong, but **[the 1969 conflict offers
important lessons]{.underline}**. **[China started a war in which it
believed nuclear weapons would be irrelevant]{.underline}**, even though
the Soviet arsenal was several orders of magnitude larger than China's,
just as the U.S. arsenal dwarfs China's today. **[Once the conventional
war did not go as planned]{.underline}**, **[the Chinese reversed their
assessment of the possibility of a nuclear attack]{.underline}** **[to a
degree bordering on paranoia]{.underline}**. Most worrying, **[China
signaled that it was]{.underline}** actually **[considering using its
nuclear weapons]{.underline}**, **[even though it had to
expect]{.underline}** devastating **[retaliation]{.underline}**.
Ambiguous wartime information and worst-case thinking led it to take
nuclear risks it would have considered unthinkable only months earlier.
This pattern could unfold again today.

#### Mine warfare and unmanned submarines are key to deter Chinese invasion of Taiwan

**[A US navy [commander suggests]{.mark} that [laying mines in]{.mark}
the [Yellow Sea and]{.mark} [Pearl River]{.mark} Delta could
[help]{.mark} [bring Beijing to]{.mark} the [negotiating

The United States could pursue an aggressive but low-cost strategy of
laying mines in the Yellow Sea and Pearl River Delta to **[force China
to negotiate in the event of conflict between the two
powers]{.underline}**, according to an American naval analyst.

**[He said the [countermeasure]{.mark} could be [seen as a form of
deterrence]{.mark} or economic warfare designed [to prevent
an escalation]{.mark} [if the US decided to
intervene](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3160692/us-has-practised-strategic-ambiguity-taiwan-decades-set-change) [following]{.mark}
a [[mainland Chinese attack on
Taiwan]{.mark}](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/military/article/3182168/beijing-likely-step-its-campaign-reunify-taiwan-analysts-say)]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}

In an article published by the US Naval Institute this month, Commander
Victor Duenow wrote that the country\'s armed forces would be at a
\"significant and immediate disadvantage\" when dealing with the
aggressive and capable [People\'s Liberation
Army](https://www.scmp.com/topics/china-military) as [China had closed
the military capability gap with the
US](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/military/article/3182724/keep-china-pentagon-must-cut-red-tape-and-embrace-latest),
and even gained superiority in several areas.

The article, which won the first prize in naval mine warfare essay
contest sponsored by the Mine Warfare Association, a non-profit aimed at
promoting awareness of the weapons, suggested **[the US Indo-Pacific
Command (IndoPaCom) should \"pursue offensive mining capabilities to use
in the Yellow Sea and Pearl River Delta]{.underline}**\".

Duenow, who has experience of airborne mine countermeasures, said the
PLA Navy (PLAN) was \"limited\" in how it could respond, and had mainly
focused on countering mines in ports and near the shore.

\"**[Finding a way to bring China into diplomatic negotiations on
favorable terms to the United States is the goal, and offensive mine
warfare can help achieve it]{.underline}**,\" he wrote, adding
that mine warfare would also jeopardise China\'s economy by disrupting
trade and oil supplies.

\"The United States can also dispute Chinese sea control while preparing
for a counteroffensive \... By investing in cost-effective mine warfare,
IndoPaCom can deter Chinese aggression and buy time while it builds
high-end warfighting capabilities to better counter China.\"

**[Tensions in the Taiwan Strait have mounted in recent years as
the [PLA has stepped up its military
operations](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/military/article/3180160/chinese-pla-bombers-carry-out-night-raid-drills-around-taiwan)]{.underline}**,
prompting a renewed focus on what the US reaction would be to an attack
on the island.

Beijing considers Taiwan as a renegade province that should be brought
into its fold - by force if necessary.

**[\"Naval [mining is a nasty countermeasure that would put]{.mark} both
[Chinese warships]{.mark} and commercial vessels [at high
risk]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,\"]{.mark} Beijing based naval analyst Li
Jie said, but argued the tactic was more likely to trigger a response
from the PLA than force China to the negotiating table.

\"**[The PLAN will stage a comprehensive minesweeper campaign by
blocking waterways in the region]{.underline}**. If Washington wants to
push Beijing into a corner, it might push the PLA to take tit-for-tat
action by laying naval mines in some waterways used by American
vessels.\"

Macau-based military observer Antony Wong Tong said the US could use
stealth fighter jets to drop homing torpedoes in the Pearl River Delta.

\"The Pearl River Delta area includes inland rivers and has no warships.
Moves to lay mines in that area would actually be targeting civilian
vessels, which will violate international law,\" Wong said.

**[The US [navy]{.mark} is [developing]{.mark} a new type
of [mine warfare]{.mark} that can be [placed covertly on]{.mark} the
[seabed by a robot submarine with sensors]{.mark} to spot a
target]{.underline}** by firing an encapsulated homing torpedo.

Drew Thompson, a visiting senior research fellow at the National
University of Singapore\'s Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, said:
\"If \[mainland\] **[[China]{.mark} decides [to use force against
Taiwan]{.mark}, [there will be intervention, and]{.mark} there will
be [escalation]{.mark}]{.underline}**,\" **[[adding naval mining]{.mark}
could be seen as a form of economic warfare.]{.underline}**

\"Economic warfare is a major tool in China\'s toolkit, as is economic
coercion \[against Taiwanese businesses\], just as the US and UN use
financial sanctions. China denounces other countries\' unilateral
sanctions, even when it practices its own**[. Blockades are an extension
of warfare]{.underline}**.\"

Collin Koh, a research fellow with the S Rajaratnam School of
International Studies at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore,
said: \"Naval mining is ultimately one of the tools used in the lead up
to, and during war.

\"Assuming naval mining is done in the window of tension that precedes
the possible outbreak of conflict, such a known act will of course be
inflammatory and escalatory, **[but it may also [help to cool heads and
compel the other party to reconsider]{.mark} his
[options]{.mark}.\"]{.underline}**

During the Vietnam war, the US conducted a short minelaying campaign
after North Vietnam launched its Easter offensive in March 1972, that
saw thousands being laid in the waters off Haiphong and other ports.

A year later it had to remove them all in a six-month operation agreed
under the Paris Peace Accords.

Also, in a China--Taiwan scenario, **[a good counter [A2/AD]{.mark} zone

antisubmarine capabilities as a potential vulnerability.]{.underline}**
Since China has weak antisubmarine capabilities, the joint force,
Taiwan, and allies can position submarines as a deterrent force that
could inflict an extremely high cost to China's fleets. **[The [use of

**[While, [Turkish President]{.mark} Recep Tayyip Erdogan [said]{.mark}
that [his government was vigilant]{.mark}]{.underline}** and had taken
necessary steps, **[the [threat of undiffused mines]{.mark} crossing the
Bosphorus [lingers]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[On the west of the
Bosphorus lies the Mediterranean]{.underline}**- consisting of European
countries like Greece, Italy and France; African countries including
Egypt, Algeria and Morocco and the Jewish state of Israel. Arab states,
including Lebanon and Syria, which are already shadowed by decades of
war, also lie on the Mediterranean coast. **[[Turkey]{.mark}, which
holds control over the Bosphorus [is under maximum
threat]{.mark}. Experts and observers have opined that [even a single
explosion could lead to heavy destruction.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**[Notably, a [total of 420 mines were deployed off the coast of
Odesa]{.mark} by Ukrainian authorities]{.underline}** to deter Russian
troops. It **[is now known how many of them are currently floating free

#### Those mines undermine the Black sea economy which is key to food, semiconductors, supply shipping, and the global economy Joshua **Keating 22**, Joshua Keating is a global security reporter for Grid focused on conflict, diplomacy and foreign policy, author of the book, \"Invisible Countries: Journeys to the Edge of Nationhood," a graduate of Oberlin College, 5/25/22, "Why the battle for the Black Sea may be the most important showdown in the war --- for Ukraine and for the world," Grid, <https://www.grid.news/story/global/2022/05/25/why-the-battle-for-the-black-sea-may-be-the-most-important-showdown-in-the-war-for-ukraine-and-for-the-world/>, JH

**[Russia had an advantage in the Black Sea from the
start]{.underline}**. Prior to 2014, both countries maintained naval
fleets in Crimea under a [treaty signed in the
1990s](https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/01/world/setting-past-aside-russia-and-ukraine-sign-friendship-treaty.html).
When Russian President Vladimir Putin's forces annexed the Crimean
Peninsula, they also took over about [75 percent of Ukraine's
fleet](https://www.defensenews.com/naval/2021/08/09/after-2014-decimation-ukrainian-navy-rebuilds-to-fend-off-russia/),
leaving it reliant on a "mosquito fleet" of mostly small patrol boats to
defend its southern coast.

In the early days of the current war, **[[Russia's navy]{.mark} [[moved
quickly to
enact](https://warontherocks.com/2022/04/the-russo-ukrainian-war-at-sea-retrospect-and-prospect/) a
blockade]{.mark} of the Ukrainian coast. It closed off the Kerch Strait,
which connects the smaller Sea of Azov to the Black Sea.]{.underline}**
The important Sea of Azov port cities of Berdyansk and Mariupol have
since fallen to Russian forces. Some 20 Russian naval vessels including
six submarines are also patrolling the southern coast.

**[Further west, Russian warships and the forces now stationed on Snake
Island are also enforcing a blockade on Odessa]{.underline}**, Ukraine's
largest seaport. Ukrainian forces have been fighting to retake
the [now-iconic
outcropping](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61406808), hoping to
prevent the Russians from setting up surface-to-air missile capabilities
there.

**[[Adding to the danger are hundreds of sea mines]{.mark} that both

these mines [[have become

ships](https://www.ft.com/content/8151ba97-5c07-4cef-9ad9-234c532b2481) are
stuck in Ukrainian ports, and at least 10 have been
attacked.]{.underline}**

A few ships have been moving along coastal routes between Odessa and the
Black Sea's outlet to the Danube River at the town of Izmail. In theory,
this could allow Ukraine to ship goods as far west as the Netherlands
via Europe's inland waterways. Unfortunately, Izmail also lies within
artillery range of Snake Island.

Economic impact

The [effect of international sanctions on Russia's
economy](https://www.grid.news/story/global/2022/05/12/is-the-russian-economy-stabilizing-or-doomed-both/) has
gotten more attention, but **[the damage done to the country where
fighting is actually taking place has been far more
profound.]{.underline}**

**[The [World Bank
projects](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/04/ukraine-economy-decline-war/#:~:text=World%20Bank%3A%20Ukraine%20economy%20to%20contract%20by%2045%25%20in%202022,global%20slowdown%20and%20surging%20inflation.) that
Ukraine's economy will contract by up to 45 percent this
year]{.underline}**. Some of this is pure physical destruction: The Kyiv
School of Economics estimated that as of the beginning of May, the
war [had caused \$94
billion](https://kse.ua/about-the-school/news/direct-damage-caused-to-ukraine-s-infrastructure-during-the-war-has-reached-over-94-billion/) in
infrastructure damage. **[Then there's the lost economic output of the 6
million Ukrainians who have left the country, and the roughly equal
number who have been internally displaced.]{.underline}**

**[But when asked about the first thing [the international community
could]{.mark} do to support Ukraine's economy, Natalie Jaresko, the
country's former minister of finance, answered "[unblock the
ports]{.mark}." Prior to the war, Black Sea shipping accounted for half
of the country's total external [trade]{.mark} and 90 percent of its
trade in grains including wheat and sunflower oil. [Ukraine is the
world's [fourth-largest grain
exporter](https://www.reuters.com/business/ukraine-could-lose-6-bln-grain-exports-with-ports-blocked-2022-03-21/),
and losses could top \$6 billion]{.mark}.]{.underline}** "There's about
20 million tons sitting in storage that has to be exported to make room
for the new harvest," Jaresko said. "Otherwise, we know something's
going to rot."

**[[Critical as food is, it's not the only commodity]{.mark} affected by
the maritime blockade. [Ukraine produces]{.mark} [around [half the
world's
supply](https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-ukraine-halts-half-worlds-neon-output-chips-clouding-outlook-2022-03-11/) of
the neon gas used to produce semiconductor chips]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Ukraine is also a [major producer of the wire
harnesses](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-15/ukraine-plant-shutdowns-may-cost-europe-output-of-700-000-cars?sref=C3P1bRLC) used
in European cars' electrical systems.

**[All of these goods have traditionally left Ukraine by
sea.]{.underline}**

The shutdown of Ukraine's most important trade route has left the
country heavily dependent on foreign aid. The good news for Ukrainians:
They are receiving quite a bit of aid. The \$40 billion economic
assistance package passed by Congress last week includes [\$8.76 billion
in economic
assistance](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/5/19/unprecedented-us-congress-passes-massive-ukraine-aid-package).
But these funds are neither sufficient nor sustainable in the long run.

**[Shipping analyst John Konrad said Russia's [blockade is a reminder of
the still-critical role of shipping in the global
economy]{.mark}]{.underline}**. "We have a kind of global 'sea
blindness,'" he told Grid. "We think everything can just be airlifted
out. It can't. Grain is too heavy and bulky. And it would be extremely
expensive to truck it all."

**[Critical as it is for Ukraine, the effects of the blockade are being
felt globally via disruptions to the [international food
supply](https://www.grid.news/story/360/2022/04/04/casualty-of-war-in-ukraine-the-global-food-supply/),
[particularly in food-vulnerable countries in the Middle East
and]{.mark} [Africa]{.mark} that were heavily dependent on Ukrainian
grain]{.underline}**. Ukraine [grows enough
food](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/05/19/the-coming-food-catastrophe) to
feed 400 million people around the world, at a time when prices were

Beasley [warned last
month](https://www.ft.com/content/8151ba97-5c07-4cef-9ad9-234c532b2481),
"**[Millions of people will die because these ports are blocked." Or as
Jaresko put it to Grid, "what Putin has done is declare war against the
world's poor."]{.underline}**

**[The battle for control of the Black Sea has gotten less international
attention than the fights over territory on land. One could argue it's
the front of this war that matters most for the rest of the
world.]{.underline}**

barley shortage**[: How Russia-Ukraine [war triggered a global food
crisis]{.mark}]{.underline}**," Fox
11https://www.foxla.com/news/wheat-barley-shortage-russia-ukraine-war-trigger-food-crisis

**[[Russian hostilities]{.mark} in Ukraine are [preventing grain from
leaving]{.mark} the \"[breadbasket of the world]{.mark}\" and making
food more expensive across the globe, threatening to worsen shortages,
hunger and political instability in developing countries]{.underline}**.

**[Together, [Russia and
Ukraine](https://www.fox5dc.com/tag/russia-ukraine) export nearly a
third of the world's wheat and barley, more than 70% of its sunflower
oil and are big suppliers of corn]{.underline}**. Russia is the top
global fertilizer producer.

**[[World food prices were already climbing]{.mark}, and the war made
things worse, preventing some 20 million tons of Ukrainian grain from
getting to the Middle East, North Africa and parts of
Asia]{.underline}**.

**[Weeks of [negotiations]{.mark} on safe corridors to get grain out of
Ukraine\'s Black Sea ports [have made little
progress]{.mark}]{.underline}**, with urgency rising as the summer
harvest season arrives.

\"**[[This needs to happen in the next couple of months (or) it's going
to be horrific]{.underline}]{.mark}**,'' said Anna Nagurney, who studies
crisis management at the University of Massachusetts Amherst and is on
the board of the Kyiv School of Economics.

**[She says 400 million people worldwide rely on Ukrainian food
supplies. The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization projects up to 181
million people in 41 countries could face food crisis or worse levels of
hunger this year.]{.underline}**

Here's a look at the global food crisis:

What\'s the situation?

**[Typically, [90% of wheat]{.mark} and other grain from Ukraine\'s
fields are [shipped]{.mark} to world markets [by sea]{.mark} but have
been held up by Russian blockades of the Black Sea coast]{.underline}**.

**[Some grain is being rerouted through Europe by rail, road and river,
but the amount is a drop in the bucket compared with sea
routes]{.underline}**. The shipments also are backed up because
Ukraine's rail gauges don\'t match those of its neighbors to the west.

Ukraine's deputy agriculture minister, Markian Dmytrasevych, asked
European Union lawmakers for help exporting more grain, including
expanding the use of a Romanian port on the Black Sea, building more
cargo terminals on the Danube River and cutting red tape for freight
crossing at the Polish border.

But that means food is even farther from those that need it.

**[\"Now you have to go all the way around Europe to come back into the
Mediterranean. It really has added an incredible amount of cost to
Ukrainian grain,']{.underline}**' said Joseph Glauber, senior research
fellow at the International Food Policy Research Institute in
Washington.

Ukraine has only been able to export 1.5 million to 2 million tons of
grain a month since the war, down from more than 6 million tons, said
Glauber, a former chief economist at the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

**[Russian grain isn\'t getting out, either. Moscow argues that Western
sanctions on its banking and shipping industries make it impossible for
Russia to export food]{.underline}** and fertilizer and are scaring off
foreign shipping companies from carrying it. Russian officials insist
sanctions be lifted to get grain to global markets.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and other Western
leaders say, however, that sanctions don\'t touch food.

What are the sides saying?

Ukraine has accused Russia of shelling agricultural infrastructure,
burning fields, stealing grain and trying to sell it to Syria after
Lebanon and Egypt refused to buy it. Satellite images taken in late May
by Maxar Technologies show Russian-flagged ships in a port in Crimea
being loaded with grain and then days later docked in Syria with their
hatches open.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says **[Russia has provoked a
global food crisis]{.underline}**. The West agrees, with officials like
European Council President Charles Michel and U.S. Secretary of State
Antony Blinken saying Russia is weaponizing food.

**[[Russia says exports can resume once Ukraine removes mines in the
Black Sea]{.mark} and [arriving ships can]{.mark} [be checked]{.mark}
for weapons.]{.underline}**

**[[Russian]{.mark} Foreign [Minister]{.mark} Sergey Lavrov
[promised]{.mark} that [Moscow would not \"abuse\" its naval]{.mark}
[advantage]{.mark} and would \"take all necessary steps to ensure that
the ships can leave there freely.\"]{.underline}**

Ukraine and Russia mainly export staples to developing countries that
are most vulnerable to cost hikes and shortages.

**[Countries like Somalia, Libya, Lebanon, Egypt and Sudan are heavily
reliant on wheat, corn and sunflower oil from the two warring
nations.]{.underline}**

\"**[The burden is being shouldered by the very poor,\" Glauber said.
\"That's a humanitarian crisis, no question.'']{.underline}**

Beside the threat of hunger, **[[spiraling food prices risk political
instability in such countries]{.mark}. They were one of the causes of
the Arab Spring, and there are worries of a repeat]{.underline}**.

The governments of developing countries must either let food prices rise
or subsidize costs, Glauber said. A moderately prosperous country like
Egypt, the world\'s top wheat importer, can afford to absorb higher food
costs, he said.

Weapons of Mass Destruction

**[Detonating just]{.underline}** **[[50]{.underline}]{.mark}**--100 out
of the global arsenal of nearly 15,000 **[[nuc]{.mark}lear
weapon[s]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[would]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[suffice to [end civilisation in]{.mark} a [nuclear winter]{.mark},
causing]{.underline}** **[worldwide famine]{.underline}**
**[and]{.underline}** **[economic collapse]{.underline}** **[affecting
even]{.underline}** **[distant]{.underline}** **[nations]{.underline}**,
as we saw in the previous chapter in the section dealing with South
Asia. **[Eight nations]{.underline}** now **[have the power
to]{.underline}** **[terminate civilisation]{.underline}** should they
desire to do so -- **[and]{.underline}** **[two]{.underline}** **[have
the power to]{.underline}** **[extinguish the human
species]{.underline}**. According to the nuclear monitoring group
Ploughshares, this arsenal is distributed as follows:

> -- Russia, 6600 warheads (2500 classified as 'retired')
>
> -- America, 6450 warheads (2550 classified as 'retired')
>
> -- France, 300 warheads
>
> -- China, 270 warheads
>
> -- UK, 215 warheads
>
> -- Pakistan, 130 warheads
>
> -- India, 120 warheads
>
> -- Israel, 80 warheads
>
> -- North Korea, 15--20 warheads.11

Although actual numbers of warheads have continued to fall from its peak
of 70,000 weapons in the mid 1980s, scientists argue
**[the]{.underline}** [**[danger]{.underline}** **[of
nuc]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[lear [conflict]{.mark} in
fact]{.underline}** **[[increased]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[in the first
two decades of the twenty-first century]{.underline}**. This was **[due
to]{.underline}** the **[modernisation]{.underline}** of existing
stockpiles, the adoption of dangerous **[new]{.underline}**
**[tech]{.underline}**nologies **[such as robot delivery systems,
hypersonic missiles,]{.underline}** **[a]{.underline}**rtificial
**[i]{.underline}**ntelligence **[and]{.underline}**
**[e]{.underline}**lectronic **[w]{.underline}**arfare,
**[and]{.underline}** the **[continuing leakage]{.underline}** **[of
nuclear]{.underline}** **[materials]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}**
**[knowhow]{.underline}** to nonnuclear nations and potential terrorist
organisations.

In early 2018 the hands of the 'Doomsday Clock', maintained by the
Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, were re-set at two minutes to
midnight, the highest risk to humanity that it has ever shown since the
clock was introduced in 1953. This was due not only to the state of the
world's nuclear arsenal, but also to irresponsible language by world
leaders, the growing use of social media to destabilise rival regimes,
and to the rising threat of uncontrolled climate change (see below).12

In an historic moment on 17 July 2017, 122 nations voted in the UN for
the first time ever in favour of a treaty banning all nuclear weapons.
This called for comprehensive prohibition of "a full range of
nuclear-weapon-related activities, such as undertaking to develop, test,
produce, manufacture, acquire, possess or stockpile nuclear weapons or
other nuclear explosive devices, as well as the use or threat of use of
these weapons."13 However, 71 other countries -- including all the
nuclear states -- either opposed the ban, abstained or declined to vote.
The Treaty vote was nonetheless interpreted by some as a promising first
step towards abolishing the nuclear nightmare that hangs over the entire
human species.

In contrast, 192 countries had signed up to the Chemical Weapons
Convention to ban the use of chemical weapons, and 180 to the Biological
Weapons Convention. As of 2018, 96 per cent of previous world stocks of
chemical weapons had been destroyed -- but their continued use in the
Syrian conflict and in alleged assassination attempts by Russia
indicated the world remains at risk.14

As things stand, the only entities that can afford to own nuclear
weapons are nations -- and **[if humanity is to be wiped out,
it]{.underline}** **[will]{.underline}** **[most likely]{.underline}**
**[be as a result of an atomic conflict]{.underline}** between nations.
It follows from this that, if the world is to be made safe from such a
fate it will need to get rid of nations as a structure of human
self-organisation and replace them with wiser, less aggressive forms of
self-governance. After all, the nation state really only began in the
early nineteenth century and is by no means a permanent feature of
self-governance, any more than monarchies, feudal systems or priest
states. Although many people still tend to assume it is. Between them,
nations have butchered more than 200 million people in the past 150
years and it is increasingly clear the world would be a far safer, more
peaceable place without either nations or nationalism. The question is
what to replace them with.

Although there may at first glance appear to be no close linkage between
weapons of mass destruction and food, **[in the twenty-first century
[with]{.mark} world resources of [food]{.mark}, land and water under
growing [stress, nothing can be ruled out]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Indeed, **[chemical weapons have]{.underline}**
**[frequently]{.underline}** **[been deployed in the Syrian civil war,
which had drought]{.underline}**, **[ag]{.underline}**ricultural
**[failure]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}** **[hunger]{.underline}**
**[among its]{.underline}** **[early drivers]{.underline}**. And
[**[nuclear conflict]{.underline}** **[remains]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[a]{.underline}** **[distinct [possibil]{.mark}ity in [South
Asia]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}**[and the [Middle
East]{.mark}]{.underline}**, especially, **[as these regions
are]{.underline}** already **[stressed]{.underline}** **[in terms of
food, land and water, and their]{.underline}** **[nuclear
firepower]{.underline}** or access to nuclear materials
**[is]{.underline}** **[multiplying]{.underline}**.

It remains an open question whether [**[panicking
regimes]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[in]{.underline}** **[Russia, the
USA]{.underline}** **[or even France]{.underline}**
**[[would]{.underline}]{.mark}** be ruthless enough to **[[deploy atomic
weapons]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[in an attempt
[to]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[quell]{.mark} invasion]{.underline}**
**[by]{.underline}** tens of millions of **[desperate [refugees,
fleeing]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[famine]{.mark} and climate
chaos]{.underline}** in their own homelands -- but the possibility ought
not to be ignored.

That nuclear war is at least a possible outcome of food and climate
crises was first flagged in the report The Age of Consequences by Kurt
Campbell and the US-based Centre for Strategic and International
Studies, which stated 'it is clear that even **[nuclear
war]{.underline}** **[cannot be excluded]{.underline}** **[as
a]{.underline}** **[political consequence]{.underline}**
**[of]{.underline}** global warming'. 15 **[[Food
insecurity]{.underline}]{.mark}** is therefore a driver in the
preconditions for the use of nuclear weapons, whether limited or
unlimited.

A global famine is a likely outcome of limited use of nuclear weapons by
any country or countries -- and would be unavoidable in the event of an
unlimited nuclear war between America and Russia, making it unwinnable
for either. And **[that, as the]{.underline}** mute **[hands of the
'Doomsday Clock' so eloquently admonish, [is]{.mark}]{.underline}** also
[**[the]{.underline}** **[most likely scenario]{.underline}**
**[for]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[the]{.underline}** **[premature
[termination of the]{.mark} human [species]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

Such a grim scenario can be alleviated by two measures: the voluntary
banning by the whole of humanity of nuclear weapons, their technology,
materials and stocks -- and by a global effort to secure food against
future insecurity by diverting the funds now wasted on nuclear armaments
into building the sustainable food and water systems of the future (see
Chapters 8 and 9).

**[Another major complicating development could be the advent of
constellations or swarms of smart robotic devices]{.underline}**. For
example, **[by 2040, large numbers of [smart sea mines]{.mark} could
[pose enormous threats to]{.mark} [shipping]{.mark}; in the scenario of
Russian aggression, [NATO]{.mark} would [need to mount a
response]{.mark} to these
threats]{.underline}**.[\[6\]](https://www.brookings.edu/research/ai-and-future-warfare/#footnote-6) The
devices might in effect be miniature submarines, with sensors and
explosives as payload. **[Russia is already strong in submarine
technology[\[7\]](https://www.brookings.edu/research/ai-and-future-warfare/#footnote-7) ]{.underline}**and
could probably master this type of technology in the years to come.
**[Such unmanned underwater vehicles ([UUVs]{.mark}) [could be widely
deployed]{.mark} in places like the Baltic Sea in times of crisis.
Rather than having to hunt for a couple dozen Russian submarines, as
might be the case today---already a daunting proposition---[NATO]{.mark}
forces seeking to reach Baltic ports might need to [search for]{.mark}
hundreds or even [thousands of potent threats]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
**[It seems implausible]{.underline}** that arms control agreements
would prevent the development and **[deployment of such autonomous
systems, not only because of the verification challenges but also
because the United States itself will feel powerful incentives to create
more autonomous systems]{.underline}**, including those with the ability
to employ lethal force under certain types of conditions, as Paul
Scharre has convincingly
argued.[\[8\]](https://www.brookings.edu/research/ai-and-future-warfare/#footnote-8)

**[Another type of [robotic swarm]{.mark} might be [used to create an
interconnected network of unmanned aquatic systems functioning]{.mark},
in effect, as mobile mines or torpedoes. [This is not]{.mark} presently
a [tech]{.mark}nology concept that [the U.S. Navy has come close to
operationalizing]{.mark}]{.underline}**; a 2013 RAND study lists the
technology maturity of such systems as between 1 and 3 on a Technology
Readiness Level scale that goes from 1 to
9.[\[11\]](https://www.brookings.edu/research/ai-and-future-warfare/#footnote-11) **[[However]{.mark},
the constituent technologies, such as automated sensors, are already
largely
available]{.underline}**.[\[12\]](https://www.brookings.edu/research/ai-and-future-warfare/#footnote-12) **[[As
AI improves]{.mark}, a constellation of such [devices could be]{.mark}
made largely [autonomous]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**[Much of the [relevant tech]{.mark}nology is [already
available]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Drug-trafficking organizations have
been using semisubmersibles to transport drugs to the United States for
years, now craft with very slender vessel designs that are efficient at
cutting through waves (though still slower than most
warships).[\[13\]](https://www.brookings.edu/research/ai-and-future-warfare/#footnote-13) A
decade ago, it was already possible to build such boats with a payload
of 10 tons and at a cost of less than \$1 million per vessel; they were
often manned then, but making them fully autonomous would not be a major
leap.[\[14\]](https://www.brookings.edu/research/ai-and-future-warfare/#footnote-14)

**[Such [capabilities create]{.mark} the specter of not just "[smart
mines]{.mark}"]{.underline}** (able to distinguish one type of ship from
another before detonating) **[but mobile, re-deployable, [and agile
mines]{.mark} operating as autonomous networks]{.underline}**. Since
mines have been responsible for most U.S. Navy ship losses since World
War II, **[this is a particularly unsettling
prospect]{.underline}**.[\[15\]](https://www.brookings.edu/research/ai-and-future-warfare/#footnote-15) In
modern times, **[the U.S. [Navy]{.mark} has [primarily avoided mines by
staying clear of waters]{.mark} where they might be
deployed]{.underline}**, as opposed to having any particularly effective
counter to them. The main alternative, as outlined by Caitlin Talmadge,
would be to conduct extensive clearing operations to create relatively
narrow channels for movement, if enough time is available for such
purposes. (**[[Talmadge]{.mark} [estimated]{.mark} a month or more in a
[scenario in which Iran mined the Persian Gulf and the U.S.]{.mark} Navy
[and allies]{.mark} then [sought to clear the
waterways]{.mark}]{.underline}**.)[\[16\]](https://www.brookings.edu/research/ai-and-future-warfare/#footnote-16) Used
against America's enemies of recent decades, this might have been a
doable proposition. But when a U.S. Navy vessel has to approach a Baltic
port against a Russian foe of 2025 or 2030 or 2035 or 2040, the
situation could be very different. **[[Clearing operations]{.mark}
against what [would in effect be]{.mark} mobile and self-healing
[minefields populated by devices]{.mark} that [can communicate with each
other]{.mark} and reposition themselves to create dense, [lethal
networks will be much more difficult than clearing current
threats]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**[If [NATO figured out]{.mark} how to jam the [communications
between]{.mark} smart, unmanned, mobile [mines]{.mark}, the adversary's
robotic [systems]{.mark} might simply be [deployed in redundant
patterns]{.mark}]{.underline}** to be sure there were no gaps in
coverage. They could also be programmed to change their positions every
so often to elude neutralization and to repair any potential gaps in
their coverage---even if there were no central data processor that
actually knew where the gaps were located and even if space-based
navigation systems were disabled (since the UUVs could have various
types of inertial or bottom-following
guidance).[\[17\]](https://www.brookings.edu/research/ai-and-future-warfare/#footnote-17) **[The
network could be set up simply to play the odds, in an environment of
little communication and poor information exchange.]{.underline}**

Because of NATO's strategic depth and its enormous resource disparity
when measured against Russia's---**[[two advantages]{.mark} the
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates and its [allies would likely not have in
the Pacific theater against China]{.mark}]{.underline}**---NATO would
still be favored to win a conventional-only conflict in eastern Europe
20 years from now. But the degree of difficulty would be quite
considerable and the degree of escalatory risk highly unsettling. In my
book, **[I attempt to [offer]{.mark} Washington and other [NATO]{.mark}
capitals some policy options. For the purposes of this essay, the simple
point is this: [robotics and AI could take on a central, and very
important, role in warfare by 2040]{.mark}---even without anything
resembling a terminator or a large killer robot.]{.underline}**

#### NATO has the largest minesweeper fleet, but modernization is required

Andrea **Daolio 19**, Andrea Daolio, from Italy, has an engineering
background and a longstanding passion for wargaming and for
geopolitical, historical, and military topic, 10/21/19, "Meeting the
Mine Warfare Challenge with Unmanned Systems," CIMSEC,
https://cimsec.org/meeting-the-mine-warfare-challenge-with-unmanned-systems/

During World War II, Operation Starvation which mined Japanese home
waters severely disrupted Japanese maritime traffic and sunk more than
1.2 million tons of shipping for the loss of only 15 airplanes, while
demanding only 5.7 percent of the XXI Bomber Command's total sorties.
Yet a few years later the U.S. Navy was unprepared when it had to face
enemy mines itself in the Korean War, resulting in the delay of the
amphibious landing at Wonsan. At the end of the war, the mine
countermeasures forces, which accounted for less than two percent of all
UN naval forces, had suffered 20 percent of naval casualties.

The 1987-1988 and 1991-1992 Gulf crises once again showed how deadly
mines can be even for a totally superior force, damaging the USS Samuel
B. Roberts (FFG-58), the flagship for Airborne Mine Countermeasures
operations USS Tripoli (LPH-10) and the USS Princeton (CG-59). Since
World War II, mines have damaged or sunk four more times more US Navy
ships than all other weapons.[\

over 50,000 mines]{.underline}** (some put the estimate as high as
80,000 or even 100,000), consisting of over 30 varieties of contact,
magnetic, acoustic, water pressure and mixed reaction sea mines, remote
control sea mines, rocket-rising and mobile mines.1

**[Russia has a fleet of 47 Mine Warfare vessels and inherited an
arsenal of "upwards of 250,000" mines from the Soviet Union, while
[Iran]{.mark} is [estimated]{.mark} to have [between 3,000 and
20,000]{.mark} mines and North Korea is said to have 50,000
mines]{.underline}**.2 As if these numbers were not threatening enough,
Iraq was able to damage two U.S. Navy ships by deploying only around
1,000 mines, many of them old types dating back to before World War I
that can be replicated cheaply (contact mines cost as little as \$1500)
even by third world nations. More than 30 countries produce and more
than 20 countries export mines, and even highly sophisticated versions
of the weapon are available in the international arms trade.

**[[NATO]{.mark} on the other hand [has the largest MCM fleet]{.mark} in
the world with 149 ships (as of 2016), [but those ships are]{.mark}
becoming [old and obsolete]{.mark} (many are [second-hand vessels
retired by their original owner and then sold to smaller NATO
countries]{.mark}). And only 7 percent of these vessels are part of the
U.S. Navy. [The need to renovate and enlarge this force is immediately
apparent]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

#### AI submarines solve mine detection and avoidable collisions; they cost less too

**[Integration of [AI]{.mark} in navy [will help in developing]{.mark}
new offensive ships and [submarines]{.mark} [which]{.mark} will be able
to [perform various functions]{.mark} at once]{.underline}**. This will
not only result in more deadly attacks but will also save on the number
of ships and manpower required to carry out such tasks separately on
separate ships and separate locations. One such unmanned submersible is
the one recently acquired by the US Navy, based on Boeing's Echo Voyager
prototype UUV Orca Extra Large Unmanned Undersea Vehicles (XLUUVs).

This is a 15.5m long submersible which offers a range of 6,500 nautical
miles and numerous months of operation on a single fuel module. It uses
a Kalman filtered inertial navigation unit aided by a set of doppler
velocity logs, and depth sensors to navigate underwater since it can
only use GPS at the surface. **[This is a [multi-functional]{.mark},
offensive undersea [vehicle]{.mark} which [can indulge in mine]{.mark}
[countermeasures]{.mark}, anti-[submarine warfare]{.mark}, anti-surface
warfare, electronic warfare and strike missions.]{.underline}** It was
also put to test. Ocean testing tasks included charging the battery,
controlling the vehicle in currents and wave action, submerging the
vehicle and returning to the surface. Echo Voyager returned to sea in
2018 through early this year for Bravo sea trials, designed to expand
the operational envelope from the initial test series." a Boeing
spokesperson said.

**[The [current system]{.mark} of navigating in water [has proven to be
very problematic]{.mark} for the department of navy and has [also been
heavy on the capital]{.mark} resources [due to the number of avoidable
collisions]{.mark}.]{.underline}** **[These [incidents]{.mark} can be
[checked by deploying AI for such tasks]{.mark} which will make
navigation reliable and efficient]{.underline}**. It will help in
detecting obstacles in unfavorable conditions and from a great distance.
This will also give more time for maneuvering past the object without
putting too much pressure on the sailor. Sea Hunter is one such
autonomous ship procured by the US Navy which performs most of its
functions without human interference. The most surprising part about
this ship is its completely autonomous navigation system. Sea Hunter
became the first ship to autonomously navigate from San Diego to Pearl
Harbor, Hawaii, and back without a single crew member aboard and without
any major collision.

The Sea Hunter is the first entirely unmanned sea voyager. It was
engineered by Reston, Va.- based Leidos. They say that it is
**[[navigated]{.mark} [by]{.mark} a specially designed artificial
intelligence ([AI]{.mark}), which assimilates the required data from
sensors, radars and AI cameras installed on the vessel. It can be on its
own for weeks while [perform]{.mark}ing various [functions like tracking
enemy submarines, removing mines, detecting torpedoes]{.mark} and acting
as a communication relay. Like any other AI based autonomous naval
vehicle this ship [also costs way less than fully manned
ships]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Operating Sea Hunter costs \$20,000 a day,
which is 35 times less than the daily running costs of an Arleigh
Burke-class destroyer (\$700,000).

**[[Threat detection]{.mark} in navy usually involves spotting static as
well as moving objects in the route finalized for carrying out any task.
This further [helps]{.mark} in navigating efficiently and [avoiding
collisions]{.mark} and unwanted confrontations [and encounters with
underwater mines]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In a research conducted by
Albert Michael we see how pre-processing and minimum risk routes have
been combined to navigate aircraft carriers for a successful flight.

**[Of the 62 missions and functions we evaluated, 27 are highly suitable
for USV employment.]{.underline}** Table 4.1 divides the full list of
missions and functions into three levels of suitability for USV
employment (highly suitable, possibly suitable, and less suitable) and
three levels of USV technological development (in or near market,
emerging, and incipient).

As the left-hand cell of the top row shows, **[USV applications that are
already in or near the combined civilian/military market are almost all
highly suitable for U.S. Navy missions]{.underline}** and functions. For
example, USVs for the SAR of conscious victims have already been
employed on beaches, particularly for the rescue aspect of this mission,
in which the USV is directed to the victim, who grabs it and rides it to
safety. Using a USV rather than a manned asset for this mission can
reduce risk to additional personnel. **[[USVs]{.mark} are already
[capable of persistent]{.mark} ISR and environmental collection in
permissive environments and have long been used for both testing and
training]{.underline}**; for all of these applications, USVs can reduce
costs and the requirement for capital assets. Other nations' navies
already employ USVs for influence minesweeping. **[Mechanical
[minesweeping]{.mark} and "[mine harvesting]{.mark}"]{.underline}**
(collecting detached, floating mines in a net) **[[require only]{.mark}
the use of [simple towing capabilities.]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[Employing [USVs]{.mark} for these mine warfare missions would [reduce
the risk posed to personnel and]{.mark} [capital assets]{.mark} by
exposure to minefields]{.underline}**. The U.S. Navy could acquire USVs
to fulfill these concepts of employment within the next several years.

The concepts of employment listed in the center and right-hand cells of
the top row are also highly suitable for naval missions, but they depend
on technological capabilities that are less developed. The military
deception, information operations, and electronic warfare missions could
be conducted at lower risk to personnel and capital assets, as well as
at potentially lower cost**[. In addition, [the relative expendability
of USVs]{.mark} could [enable]{.mark} these [missions to be conducted in
new]{.mark}, bolder [ways]{.mark}, [including]{.mark} in
anti-access/area-denial ([A2/AD]{.mark}) environments. USVs could play a
role in diminishing the effectiveness of an adversary's A2/AD systems
not only by deceiving adversary sensors but also by jamming or targeting
them to impair overall network performance.]{.underline}**

**[Using USVs to conduct mine warfare missions would reduce the risk
mines pose to personnel and capital assets. [Minelaying]{.mark} by USVs
could [enable]{.mark} this [mission]{.mark}, now performed exclusively
by aircraft, to [be conducted more clandestinely]{.mark} in more
dangerous A2/AD environments without imposing further demand and risk on
high-value assets]{.underline}**. In those same environments, and for
the same reasons, it would be advantageous to conduct ISR and
environmental collection using unmanned systems; USVs could be employed
when their cross-domain capabilities, payload capacity, endurance, or
other attributes make them preferable to other unmanned systems.
**[Moreover, even when [UAVs]{.mark} or UUVs are preferred, USVs could
play an important supporting role by providing them with resources,
cross-domain links, and services such as data processing]{.underline}**.
USVs could also provide such support in more benign environments, as
well as shuttle goods between ships and shore locations without
requiring the use of additional personnel.

USVs would also be highly suitable for protecting other platforms,
performing missions that are often dull but occasionally dangerous. For
example, they could serve as armed escorts for ships, keeping personnel
out of harm's way and freeing up resources for other missions.
Protecting port infrastructure and ships in port from FAC using USVs
would be advantageous if the USVs in question could be fully autonomous.
**[This would [reduce the risk to personnel]{.mark} ([and]{.mark}
potentially reduce [costs]{.mark}) [compared with having manned
vessels]{.mark} conduct the mission. Unarmed ASW area sanitization---a
painstaking mission to detect and classify any enemy submarines---could
be performed by USVs at lower risk]{.underline}** and with less demand
on capital assets than with manned platforms.

**[To reiterate, USVs are highly suitable for all of the missions and
functions listed]{.underline}** in the first row of Table 4.1. **[The
U.S. Navy could consider investing in R&D to bring these capabilities to
fruition]{.underline}**. A key consideration for resource allocation in
this context is the degree of technological advancement required, which
is not perfectly correlated with the TRL. **[Some prospective missions,
such as minelaying, may be relatively easy from a technical
standpoint;]{.underline}** **[[USV]{.mark} [capabilities]{.mark} have
[yet to be developed]{.mark} for this purpose [due to a lack of
interest]{.mark}, not technical challenges.]{.underline}** However,
developing fully autonomous USVs to counter FAC would require dramatic
advances in autonomy for threat identification and use of force.

## Iran Scenario

### 1AC \-\-- Iran Scenario

#### Scenario #\_\_: Iran

#### Iran escalating in the Strait of Hormuz with mines poses a major threat to American ships in the Gulf; only a comprehensive strategy to remove the mines solves

**[[Creating new routes for its oil exports]{.mark} may [offer Iran
escalatory options in the Strait of Hormuz]{.mark}]{.underline}**. But
would Iran take such a step? **[Such an Iranian naval offensive would
represent a serious provocation]{.underline}** --- the most direct
confrontation yet between Washington and Tehran. Some may question
whether Iran would really choose to go this route. Hypothetically, **[we
assume they may cite the resources necessary to build out Rouhani's
plan, at a time when [Iran is under increasing economic pressure]{.mark}
and facing political challenges in an upcoming domestic election
cycle]{.underline}**. Or the fact that the recent energy market crash
coupled with the pandemic crisis make such an expensive undertaking not
cost effective for Iran's oil exporting program. While all are
reasonable points for debate, these counter-arguments miss the point of
Iran's moves. **[Because [the Strait of Hormuz plays both]{.mark}
important [practical and symbolic roles in the region, advancing Iranian
capabilities to disrupt the]{.mark} waterway [is a real deterrence
tool]{.mark}, and a means by which to pressure neighbors as well as the
United States and those aligned with it]{.underline}**. **[[The credible
threat that Iran could shut down the strait]{.mark} now [is backed
by]{.mark} its increasingly effective and multi-layered [arsenal of
water and limpet mines]{.mark},]{.underline}** fast and attack boats,
drone boats, anti-ship missiles, coastal defense**[, and
submarines.]{.underline}**

So, Iran may have increasing capabilities to conduct more aggressive
operations in the strait. But who would risk making the decision to go
ahead with it? **[On paper, the two Iranian navies still share the
Strait of Hormuz as an area of responsibility]{.underline}**. But in
practice, the Guards have the upper hand there. And in addition to being
better funded and equipped than the traditional Iranian navy, the
Revolutionary Guards are also more aggressive than their conventional
counterparts. The Revolutionary Guards navy will continue to employ an
asymmetric doctrine when deciding how its naval assets are used. The
objective is not naval superiority, but rather the bread and butter of
the Guards' operations: a mix of lower cost, sometimes proxy-executed,
asymmetric tactics that can cause pain, sow concern, and build leverage.

**[Meanwhile, [the U.S. Navy's fleet of minesweepers

Navy has

readiness and force upgrades across the fleet. **[Recent [budget

that initiative but the debate over the what systems to upgrade and how
much to invest is not over, [the time horizon for the initiative is
long]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and a key focus remains on tools to address
great power competition --- specifically in the Pacific. **[The Navy's
serious undertaking is not aided by distractions]{.underline}** from
President Trump and his administration, commenting on[ naval rules of

Finally, the uneven responses to Iranian provocations last year
culminating in the killing of Guards Commander Qassem Soleimani have
reinforced the unpredictability of U.S. staying power. All these
elements likely factor into Iran's calculus. **[Its new comprehensive

the Rouhani government's "most strategic plan," might produce a new
lever Iran may plan to use in its favor in the Persian Gulf.

**[[Iran's plan]{.mark} to set the conditions that [would allow for

news cycle in the United States]{.underline}**. But its implications, if
implemented, are likely to reverberate for years to come, **[including
[drawing China]{.mark} further into the region]{.underline}**. As the
United States continues to send mixed signals about its strategy and
presence in the Middle East and the U.S. Navy rightly continues to shift
its attention and resources to the Pacific, **[[Iran is building its
capabilities]{.mark} and [signaling]{.mark} its [intention]{.mark} [to
consider adopting a more aggressive posture in the Persian Gulf and Gulf
of Oman.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**[[Without a clear and comprehensive strategy towards Iran in

[S]{.mark}tates [risks]{.mark} perpetuating an "either/or" [debate about
its interests]{.mark} in the Middle East]{.underline}** while not
planning for and managing for evolving threats. Developing plans to
assess Iran's intentions in the Strait of Hormuz and wider Persian Gulf
does not mean the United States, or its military, will become dragged
deeper into the region. But effective management would begin by putting
this development in the proper context of a pattern of escalation with
Iran, isolation from allies on Iran policy, and the lack of any
diplomatic efforts to de-escalate increasing tensions across the board
with Iran. **[[Without this broader analysis]{.mark}, diplomatic effort,

**[[An Act of War]{.mark}?]{.underline}**

In early 2012, **[[tensions between]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [and Iran]{.mark} were [spiking]{.mark}, and
"mine-rattling" [threats from]{.mark} [Teheran to close the Arabian Gulf
and the Strait of Hormuz]{.mark} exacerbated jittery world petroleum
markets]{.underline}**. Iranian rhetoric generated increasingly
draconian U.S. and UN sanctions. Given the experience of the 1980s
"tanker war," the naval mine threat could not be ignored. On 12 February
2012, [Vice Admiral Mark I.
Fox](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-02-12/u-s-would-block-iran-from-mining-hormuz-strait-commander-says.html),
Commander U.S. Fifth Fleet, declared**[: "[If Iran mines the Arabian
Gulf, it'll be an act of war]{.mark}."]{.underline}**

Is this correct? As it turns out, there are international guidelines for
naval mining and, if followed, they empower nations to deploy their
"weapons that wait" in peacetime and during "armed conflict." In the
latter case, mining by non-state actors, e.g., terrorist groups, might
also be permitted.

For example, [the Hague Convention VIII of
1907](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/hague08.asp) focuses on
"The Laying of Automatic Submarine Contact Mines" (Section VII) during
times of war. "**[Automatic" mines are those weapons not under the
direct control of the miner, whether anchored to the sea bottom or
not.]{.underline}** In 1907, this meant primarily contact weapons (still
in many navies' inventories in 2014), **[but the rules would also apply
to "influence" mines that fire on the magnetic, acoustic, pressure,
electric-potential and seismic "signatures" of a target surface ship or
submarine]{.underline}**. In that regard, Articles 1-2 state, **["[It is
forbidden" to lay]{.mark}]{.underline}**:

**[[Unanchored]{.mark} (i.e., drifting) automatic contact
[mines]{.mark}]{.underline}**, except when they are so constructed as to
become harmless one hour at most after the person who laid them ceases
to control them

Anchored automatic contact mines **[which do not become harmless as soon
as they have broken loose]{.underline}** from their moorings

**[Automatic contact mines, whether anchored or not]{.underline}**, off
the coast and ports of the enemy, with the sole object of intercepting
commercial shipping

**[Article 3 stipulates that when anchored automatic contact mines are
employed, every possible precaution must be taken for the security of
peaceful]{.underline}** (a broader category than just commercial)
shipping. Belligerents must "do their utmost' to render these mines
harmless within a limited time (not just an hour). **[Furthermore,
should these mines cease to be under the miner's surveillance, the
mining countries must notify ship owners and governments]{.underline}**
through diplomatic channels about the mine danger zones "as soon as
military exigencies permit."

**[Neutral countries that lay automatic contact mines off their coasts
must follow the same rules imposed on belligerents]{.underline}**. The
neutral state must inform ship owners, by a notice issued in advance,
where automatic contact mines have been laid, and this notice must be
communicated at once to the governments through diplomatic channels.

At the close of the war, the "Contracting Powers" (i.e., states party to
the 1907 convention) must do their utmost to remove the mines that they
have laid, with each government responsible for removing its own mines.
With regard to anchored automatic contact mines laid by one of the
belligerents off the coast of the other, their positions must be
notified to the other party by the Power that laid them. For example,
after the U.S. Navy mined Haiphong harbor and other North Vietnamese
waterways in July 1972 and the Paris Peace Talks resumed in January
1973, U.S. mine countermeasures (MCM) forces were responsible for
clearing all mined areas----Operation End Sweep----later that year. As
it turned out, most of the naval mines had already been [rendered safe
through
self-sterilization](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003HIWQKO/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B003HIWQKO&linkCode=as2&tag=httpwaronthec-20&linkId=Q2RLVGTW6LX2MU2K).

**[And each Power must proceed with the least possible delay to remove
the mines in its own waters]{.underline}**.

For the U.S. Navy today, the [Commander's Handbook on the Law of Naval
Operations](https://www.usnwc.edu/getattachment/a9b8e92d-2c8d-4779-9925-0defea93325c/) outlines
the naval mining rules of the road that must be followed, whether during
peace, crisis or war, to determine whether deploying "weapons that wait"
is a legal action or an act of war.

Section 9.2.2 Peacetime Mining

**[Mindful of the safety of its citizens, during peacetime a nation may
deploy armed and controlled mines in its own internal waters at any time
without notification]{.underline}**. A nation may also mine its own
archipelagic waters and territorial sea during peacetime when necessary
for its national security. If a nation deploys armed mines in its
archipelagic waters or the territorial sea, appropriate international
notification----e.g., through the International Maritime Organization
and other diplomatic channels----of the existence and location of such
mines is required. However, deploying controlled mines in a nation's own
archipelagic waters or territorial sea is not subject to such
notification or removal requirements.

**[[Because the right of innocent passage]{.mark} through territorial
seas can be suspended only temporarily, armed [mines must be
removed]{.mark} or rendered harmless as soon as the security threat that
generated their deployment has ended.]{.underline}** **[[Armed mines may
not be emplaced in international straits]{.mark} or archipelagic
sea-lanes [during peacetime]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**[A nation may deploy controlled mines in international
waters]{.underline}** (i.e., beyond the territorial sea) **[if they do
not unreasonably interfere with other lawful uses of the
oceans]{.underline}**. The determination of what constitutes an
"unreasonable interference" involves a balancing of several factors,
including the reason for their emplacement (e.g., self-defense), the
extent of the area to be mined, the hazard (if any) to other lawful
ocean uses, and the duration of their emplacement. Because controlled
mines do not constitute a hazard to navigation, international notice of
their emplacement is not required.

The Handbook notes that armed mines may not be deployed in international
waters prior to the outbreak of armed conflict, except under the most
demanding requirements of individual or collective self-defense. If
armed mines were to be deployed in international waters, the deploying
nation must provide prior notification of their location. **[Moreover,
[a nation deploying armed mines]{.mark} in international waters during
peacetime must [maintain an on-scene presence]{.mark} in the area to
ensure that appropriate warning is provided to ships approaching the
mine danger area]{.underline}**. All armed mines must be expeditiously
removed or rendered harmless, either by sweeping or self-sterilization,
when the imminent danger that justified their deployment has passed.

Thus, Gaddafi's mining of the Red Sea and Gulf of Suez in 1984 could
have been regarded as an act of war, but it took about a year to
determine, beyond reasonable doubt, that Libyan naval forces were indeed
responsible for the mines.

**[Finally, [armed]{.mark} or controlled [mines may not be emplaced
in]{.mark} internal waters, [territorial seas]{.mark}, or archipelagic
waters [of another nation in peacetime]{.mark} without that nation's
consent.]{.underline}**

It is interesting to note that the Handbook here refers only to "nation"
and not other non-state actors, e.g., terrorist groups. This must mean
that any use of naval mines by non-state actors in peacetime is illegal.

Honored in their Breach!

Perhaps honored more in their breach than observance (as evidenced by
Albania's mining of the Corfu Channel in 1946 and Iran and Iraq's
indiscriminate use of mines during the 1980s "Tanker War"), the laws of
naval mining are nonetheless clear**[. If the rules were
followed,]{.underline}** in peacetime, **[crisis and armed conflict,
China's, Russia's, Iran's and any other country's use, including the
United States, of naval mines]{.underline}**----particularly in
self-defense roles----**[would not, per se, be an "act of
war.]{.underline}**"

**[But, that's a big "if."]{.underline}**

And, so it **[might be in the Black Sea]{.underline}**, as well. **[Or
in the South China Sea, too.]{.underline}**

was [reported](https://www.reuters.com/article/shipping-security-emirates-seizure-idUSL8N2PA6EE) to
have been boarded by armed men, thought to be Iranian operatives, in the
Strait of Hormuz, while other cargo ships also reported sudden steering
problems.

**["[This is a shadow conflict between Iran and Israel]{.mark}, where

McGarry,]{.underline}** a maritime analyst with the global risk

"You can attack a Japanese-owned, Liberian-flagged vessel simply because
it's linked to an Israeli billionaire. It's a very useful way of
launching deniable attacks that don't directly target your adversary,"
he added.

**[Indeed, the alleged attack on the Mercer Street and these suspected

ships]{.underline}** traveling through the Gulf of Oman and its twin,
the Strait of Hormuz.

**[The Gulf of Oman and the [Strait of Hormuz]{.mark}, [through which

Iranian tankers transporting oil to Syria, while a range of attacks
thought to have been perpetrated by Iran have targeted ships linked to
Israel.

**["Lots of things happen in the Gulf of Oman," said Simon Lockwood, a
maritime expert with the global insurance broker Willis Towers
Watson.]{.underline}** "This is the fourth incident in a short time
involving an Israel-affiliated vessel."

For example, two years ago, the Stena Impero was thought to have been

An erosion of the public's capacity to impose democratic constraint has
a similar impact on the audience cost arguments and, more broadly, on
our understandings of democratic credibility and conflict reciprocation.
International relations scholars generally agree that leaders usually
feel some pressure to actually carry out the threats and promises that
they make in the international system. This might be because they care
about their reputation with other leaders, but the usual argument is
that democracies are more likely than autocracies to follow through on
threats because they have domestic audiences who will hold them to
account if they fail to do so (Fearon 1994; Schultz 2001). Polarization
undermines that linkage, thereby potentially undermining the democratic
advantage in foreign crisis negotiations and, ultimately, making war
more likely. [**The [tribal]{.mark} element** of **polarized
[politics]{.mark}** [means]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[followers are
**unlikely**]{.mark} to [hold]{.mark} their [leader to account.
Opposition]{.mark}]{.underline}, in turn, [is [**unlikely** to give
the]{.mark} president **any [credit regardless]{.mark} of the
policy**]{.underline}. Thus, while traditional versions of audience cost
theory assumed that in democracies domestic audiences would judge a
vacillating leader harshly, such [accountability is **less
likely**]{.underline} to emerge [in **a polarized
environment**]{.underline}.3 In this respect, [polarization]{.underline}
thus [causes democratic leaders to **more closely resemble** their
autocratic counterparts]{.underline}.

As we have noted, even in the information environment that preceded
cable, satellite, and the Internet, the public had a low baseline of
attentiveness. But voters were able to use heuristics to help them
determine both when to engage with foreign policy issues and what to
think about them when they did (Popkin 1991; Sniderman et al. 1991).
This was accomplished primarily through reliance on partisan elites
(Iyengar and Kinder 1987; Krosnick and Kinder 1990). However,
[**[opposition and disaffected]{.mark} copartisans** [have
**no**]{.mark} **meaningful [access]{.mark}** [to the public in **a
polarized**]{.mark} **and fragmented [media]{.mark} ecosystem**. Elite
[whistle-blowing will **only inhibit**]{.mark} [leaders
when]{.mark}]{.underline} there is a credible threat that [[the public
will hear **the whistle**]{.mark} **being blown**]{.underline}, but the
audience cost mechanism relies on precisely this hand-tying process. If
it breaks down there is no reason for democratically elected leaders to
fear punishment for backing down on their threats and commitments and
therefore no boost to their credibility when they make commitments.

[**The [polarized]{.mark}** and **[fragmental info]{.mark}rmation
environment**]{.underline} also [[has]{.mark} [**corrosive effects**
on]{.mark} **the [rally-round-the-flag]{.mark}
phenomenon**]{.underline}, at least with regard to how it has been
widely understood to date. Since approval rallies for presidents
following uses of force abroad were traditionally located primarily
among opposition partisans, partisan tribalism seems likely to result in
smaller and less frequent rallies. For instance, when President Obama
drew a "red line" with Syria over President Assad's use of chemical
weapons against civilians, he faced widespread criticism from
Republicans in Congress and low marks from the public over his handling
of the crisis. At the same time, public support for intervening in Syria
remained low, arguably complicating Obama's efforts to credibly
communicate America's resolve to Assad.

That said, while we may observe smaller and less frequent spikes in
presidential approval ratings as a consequence of heightened
polarization, [**a different sort of rally effect** may become **more
common**]{.underline}. That is, [**the [intensity of support]{.mark}
for** [and **opposition**]{.mark} **to** the president [might
spike]{.mark}]{.underline} among his supporters or opponents
[[in]{.mark} **the immediate aftermath of [a crisis]{.mark}
event**]{.underline}. A case in point is President Trump's recent
sounding of the alarm over a Central American migrant caravan during the
run-up to the 2018 midterm election. Notwithstanding the assertions of
many pundits, there is little evidence that President Trump succeeded in
increasing overall support for Republicans by characterizing the migrant
caravan as an invasion. Trump first tweeted about the caravan on October
18, 2018. According to data on fivethirtyeight.com, Democrats led
Republicans by 8.4 percentage points in the generic ballot during
October 1--18. The Democratic lead from October 19 through election day
was 8.3 points, or basically unchanged. Indeed, one postelection
analysis (Winston Group 2018) concluded that late-deciding voters broke
toward the Democrats by 12 points and cited the emphasis on the migrant
caravan, which crowded out good news on the economy, as a key causal
factor. However, among Republicans, concern over illegal immigration
measurably increased with Trump's caravan-related tweets. It is entirely
possible, albeit uncertain, that Republican turnout in some states
consequently rose, thereby improving the performance of Republican
candidates in close elections, such as the Senate race in Florida and
the gubernatorial race in Georgia. Since Democrats were already at
historic levels of intensity leading up to the election, such a spike
could have produced a net benefit for Republican candidates. The
implication is that [[**prior concerns** about "diversionary" conflict
were **overblown**]{.mark} because]{.underline} the types of
[conflicts]{.underline} that a leader might initiate for such a purpose
were precisely those most likely to collapse the elasticity of reality
(**[mak]{.underline}**ing [the risk greater than the potential

environment]{.mark}**]{.underline} where the electoral battle is more

Abstract

We argue that the growth rate, but not the level of aggregate income,
affects the support for extreme political parties. In our model, extreme
parties offer short-run benefits to part of the population at the
expense of a minority. Growth effects on the support for such parties
arise when uncertainty exists over whether the same subset of
individuals will receive the same benefits in the future. [**More
people** are willing to take **political risks** if]{.underline}
economic [growth is slow]{.underline}. Based on a panel of 16 European
countries, our [empirical analysis shows]{.underline} that
**[[slow]{.mark}er [growth]{.mark}]{.underline}** rates are associated
with a significant [[increase]{.underline}]{.mark} in **[right-wing
[extremism]{.mark}]{.underline}**. We find no significant effect of
economic growth on the support for extreme left-wing parties.

1 Introduction

Distributional consequences are associated with political extremism,
both in the short run and in the long run. Extreme political parties
often propose to redistribute resources away from specific subgroups of
society, such as the rich, ethnic minorities, or citizens living in
specific regions. This paper analyzes the impact of economic growth on
the support for extreme political parties in western democracies. We
argue that the growth rate, but not the level of aggregate income,
affects the support for extremism.

In the first part of our paper, we discuss three alternative
explanations for why an increase in the economic growth rate reduces the
support for extreme political parties. Two well-known explanations are
related to retrospective voting and behavioral effects, the latter
meaning that voters may react more strongly to changes in than to levels
of economic well-being. The third, novel explanation is that parties
with extreme political platforms are perceived to create considerable
uncertainty about the future distribution of income.

[We develop **a simple game-theoretic model** that analyzes]{.underline}
that [uncertainty]{.underline} effect. In our model, [extreme political
parties offer **short-run gains** from redistribution to a
group]{.underline} of individuals. [However, the same
individuals]{.underline} also [face **long-run losses**]{.underline}
owing [to the]{.underline} higher [income risk]{.underline} that is
[associated with an extreme regime]{.underline}.1 The model permits a
comparative static analysis with respect to several key variables of
interest. The [growth]{.underline} rate [is associated with **larger
future income risk**]{.underline}. Such [risk reduces the number of
voters favoring extreme parties]{.underline}. The level of aggregate
income has no effect on the support for extremism. Income inequality
raises support for redistribution and affects the impact that a change
in the growth rate has on the support for extremism.

An important feature of our model is that the effect of economic growth
on the support for extremism depends on uncertainty of future income
redistribution. If redistributive policies are perceived as
predictable---in the sense that the same group will have income taken
away from it in the future---then the political support for an extremist
party is unaffected by growth.

In the empirical part of our paper, we estimate the relationship between
economic growth and the support for extreme political parties using a
**[panel [data]{.mark}]{.underline}**set
compris[[in]{.underline}]{.mark}g **[[16]{.mark} European
[countries]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Our dependent variable is a
survey-based measure, compiled by Euro-barometer, of respondents\'
support for extreme right-wing parties and extreme left-wing parties. We
use that data, [[which spans]{.underline}]{.mark} more than **[three
[decades]{.mark}]{.underline}** and contains entries [on **a semi-annual
frequency**]{.underline}, to estimate the effects of economic growth on
the support for extremism. Our empirical analysis
[[show]{.underline}]{.mark}s a significant negative effect of real per
capita GDP growth on the support for extreme right-wing parties:
controlling for country and time fixed effects, [[a **one
percent**]{.underline}]{.mark}age point [[decline
in]{.underline}]{.mark} real per capita [**GDP [growth]{.mark}**
[increases]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[vote share of **extreme**]{.mark}
**right-wing [parties]{.mark}** [by]{.mark}]{.underline} up to
**[[one]{.mark} percent]{.underline}**age point. We document that
[the]{.underline} negative [effect]{.underline} of economic growth on
the support for right-wing extremism [is **robust** across **estimation
techniques** and **model specifications**]{.underline}. We do not find a
systematic effect of growth on the support for left-wing extremism.

A possible explanation for the differential effects between left-wing
and right-wing extremism that relates closely to our theoretical model
is that right-wing extremism might be associated with more uncertainty
over what groups will be subject to income expropriation in the future.
Left-wing extremism is associated with income redistribution, but little
uncertainty exists over its target. Communist doctrine (see, for
example, the Communist Manifesto by Marx and Engels 1848), envisions a
classless society; i.e., a society wherein incomes are distributed
equally. Over the past century, extreme left-wing parties have followed
closely that doctrine by proposing to redistribute incomes from rich to
poor; as opposition parties they have voted against laissez faire
policies and, when in power, they have implemented programs that reduced
the wealth and income prospects of the rich (see, e.g., Brown 2010).

Right-wing extremism, in contrast to left-wing extremism, does not
advocate a classless society. Instead, it often is associated with
discrimination against specific groups of society for racial, religios,
political or other reasons.2 An extreme case of a murderous and
discriminatory regime was the German fascist rule during the first half
of the 20th century. One can see it as a direct consequence of the Nazi
party\'s \"Fuhrerprinzip\"---\"the principle of unconditional authority
of the leader\" (Bernholz 2017, p.9)---which created considerable
uncertainty over who might be stigmatized, imprisoned or killed in the
future.3 Indeed, from the Nazi period we know that various groups were
stigmatized for different reasons4 and that stigmatization also was
particularly erratic.5,6

The empirical analysis of our paper is related to Stevenson (2001), who
examines the determinants of aggregate policy preferences in a panel of
14 European countries. One of Stevenson\'s main findings is that
declines in economic growth cause policy preferences to shift to the
right, while increases in economic growth cause policy preferences to
shift to the left.7 Our paper differs from Stevenson in at least three
important aspects. First, in contrast to Stevenson, we show that our
[empirical results are robust to [controlling for]{.mark} **country
[fixed effects]{.mark}**, meaning]{.underline} that our
[results]{.underline} also [hold at the **within-country level**, and
not just in **cross-section**]{.underline}. Relatedly, Acemoglu et al.
(2008, 2009) showed that the cross-country relation between income and
democracy turns insignificant when country fixed effects are entered
into the econometric model. Second, we provide evidence that our
[empirical findings [reflect a **causal effect** of]{.mark} **economic
[growth]{.mark}** [on]{.mark} **political
[extremism]{.mark}**]{.underline}. We show that our main findings are
robust to estimating dynamic models that enable to test for Granger
causality; [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} we also show that the main
findings [[hold with]{.underline}]{.mark} an **[[instrumental
variables]{.underline}]{.mark}** approach. Third, we distinguish in our
empirical analysis between extreme right-wing and extreme left-wing
parties. That distinction matters: a robust negative effect of economic
growth is found on the support for extreme right-wing parties, whereas
no systematic effect exists for the support of extreme left-wing
parties. Our finding of a significant negative effect of economic growth
on the support for right-wing extremism is in line with the finding of
Bromhead et al. (2012), who show that the [vote share of right-wing
extremists during **the Great Depression** was significantly larger
in]{.underline} those [countries that experienced a more severe economic
crisis]{.underline}. Using subnational [data for **218 European
regions** during 1990-2016]{.underline}, Rao et al. (2018) [find a
**significant negative effect** of]{.underline} regional [output on the
vote share of extreme right-wing parties]{.underline}, but no signicant
effect on extreme left-wing parties.

Is the likelihood that a democracy will take military action against
other countries largely influenced by which party controls the
presidency? Many believe so (Palmer, London, and Regan 2004; Arena and
Palmer 2009; Clare 2010). In modern American politics, one party is
consistently identified as more hawkish than the other.
[Surveys]{.underline} have [reveal]{.underline}ed that [Republican
voters]{.underline} consistently [prefer more aggressive
policies]{.underline} (Eundak 2006; Trager and Vavreck 2011; Gries
2014). Moreover, many believe that Al Gore, had he been elected, would
not have invaded Iraq like President George W. Bush did (Jervis 2003;
Lieberfeld 2005), and that the foreign policies of Hillary Clinton and
Donald Trump would be similarly opposed (Paletta 2016).

Nevertheless, it is very difficult to determine whether the party in
control of the presidency really has an important impact on foreign
policy due to the selection of parties into particular domestic and
international contexts. Put simply, which party controls the presidency
is not random. For example, the victory of George W. Bush in 2004 can be
attributed to a number of domestic and international factors at the
time, including the American public\'s heightened concerns over national
security following September 11. Similarly, Barack Obama\'s success in
2008 was influenced by problems at home and a decrease in public
willingness to engage in military adventurism. Therefore, an
[**observational [analysis]{.mark}** would]{.underline} likely [be
[**biased** by]{.mark}]{.underline} such **[[selection]{.mark}
processes]{.underline}**. Thus, [even if countries behave differently
when certain parties control the presidency, it would be]{.underline}
very [**difficult** to know if that]{.underline} difference [is
explained by]{.underline} the [parties or]{.underline} by [**the
environments** into which the parties are selected]{.underline}.

In principle, [[we]{.underline}]{.mark} could [[**overcome**
this]{.underline}]{.mark} problem [by]{.underline} running [an
experiment in which we **randomly assigned countries** to be ruled by
**leaders from different parties**. Such]{.underline} an ideal research
design [would avoid]{.underline} the **[confounding]{.underline}**
problem, [making it **possible to test** whether countries tend to
be]{.underline} more or less [aggressive when]{.underline} certain
[parties control the presidency]{.underline}. Experiments are unmatched
in their ability to identify causal effects, so this type of study could
greatly improve our understanding of how electing candidates from
different parties influences foreign policy.

We approximate this ideal experiment by [using]{.underline} a
**[[regression discontinuity]{.underline}]{.mark}** (RD) design.
Specifically, [we look at **close presidential elections** where a
candidate]{.underline} from one party [barely defeated]{.underline} a
candidate from [a different party]{.underline}. Such a design works if
it is close to random which party won in these cases, a premise which is
plausible given the inherent randomness in large national elections.
Thus, we use close elections to get data that are similar to what would
result from a real experiment. Such natural experimental designs are
extremely rare in the study of war and thus warrant attention in the
exceptional instances when they do occur.

We run two main analyses. First, we look at whether countries tend to be
more (or less) aggressive when presidential candidates from right-wing
parties barely defeat candidates from left-wing parties. This
quasi-experimental comparison involves a small sample size (n = 29), but
we still find noteworthy evidence that electing right-wing candidates
increases the likelihood that countries will initiate high-level
military disputes against other states. Second, to increase our
statistical power, we examine cases where candidates from incumbent
parties barely won or barely lost to candidates from challenger parties
(n = 36). Specifically, we test whether countries experienced a larger
change in their propensity to engage in military disputes when the
candidate from the challenger party barely won. Thus, our key outcome of
interest here is how much countries deviated from their prior levels of
dispute involvement. [We [find **statistically significant
ev**]{.mark}**idence** that]{.underline} electing candidates from
challenger parties causes countries to experience a larger change in
their propensity to engage in military conflict with other states.

Upon further examination of the data, we find that the results from our
second test are largely explained by a tendency for candidates from
challenger parties to initiate military disputes in their first year in
office. Thus, these findings support the theory that major
**[[leadership transitions]{.underline}]{.mark}** tend to
[[increase]{.underline}]{.mark} the chances of [state
[aggression]{.mark}]{.underline}, either [[because new leaders
**lack**]{.mark} **the [experience]{.mark}** [to **manage**]{.mark}
**international [crises]{.mark}** effectively [or]{.mark}]{.underline}
because [they [need to **prove**]{.mark} **their [resolve]{.mark}** [by
**acting tough**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

This article makes several important contributions to the study of
international relations. First, there is a long-standing debate in
political science over whether leaders have an important independent
impact on interstate conflict or whether their influence is largely
constrained by strategic realities (Byman and Pollack 2001; Mearsheimer
and Walt 2003; Jones and Olken 2009; Chiozza and Goemans 2011; Saunders
2011; Horowitz, Stam, and Ellis 2015; Croco 2015). This study provides
quasi-experimental evidence that leaders do have a meaningful impact on
foreign policy. Second, the results presented here suggest that domestic
political ideology can spill over into the international realm. One of
the main explanations for the democratic peace is that democracies act
in accordance with their domestic norms when it comes to foreign policy
(Morgan and Campbell 1991). The findings presented here support that
hypothesis by showing that left-wing leaders do tend to behave more
dovishly in international affairs. Third, these [[results
suggest]{.underline}]{.mark} that we should be alert to the potential
for [[**interstate conflict** when]{.underline}]{.mark} right-wing
leaders are in office, as well as after elections where party control of
the [[presidency changes]{.mark} hands]{.underline}.

[This study is]{.underline} also notable because it is one of [the
**first**]{.underline} in the international relations literature [to
use]{.underline} a [**preanalysis plan**. Prior to looking
at]{.underline} any of the [results, we **pre-registered**
the]{.underline} main [tests]{.underline} that we planned to conduct in
this article. Our motivation here was [to **tie our
hands**]{.underline}, so that [there could be **no question** of sifting
through the data to find]{.underline} the statistical tests that
produced the most interesting or [significant results]{.underline}. The
temptation for scholars to run many tests and then report the ones that
are most \"interesting\" can lead to misleading findings. This danger
has attracted a great deal of attention across scientific fields over
the last decade, and it is seen by many as a major problem for
quantitative research (Nosek et al. 2015). The purpose of preanalysis
plans is to help ensure that research remains credible.

The article proceeds as follows. We first discuss the theoretical bases
for the claim that party control of the presidency influences conflict
decisions and review the existing empirical work on this subject. We
then outline the research design in more detail. Next, we conduct design
checks to verify that the research design is appropriate. We then
present the results for party ideology. After that, we test whether
party turnover leads to changes in the likelihood of state aggression.
We then discuss the findings and conclude.

Leaders, Parties, and International Conflict

In recent years, much debate has arisen over whether leaders influence
the chances of interstate conflict, and if so, how. A major question in
this research program is whether leaders from certain parties are more
likely to behave aggressively in foreign affairs or whether the ideology
of the leader is largely unrelated to state behavior.

The theory that party control of the presidency influences the chances
of interstate conflict can be derived from three premises. The first is
that [conservatives and liberals hold different views about the
legitimacy or efficacy of military force. This]{.underline} assumption
[is backed by **cross-national survey data**]{.underline} showing that
liberals tend to be more concerned with fairness, duties of care, and
preventing harm, while conservatives tend to favor the preservation of
social orders, the purity of sanctified objects, and loyalty to
in-groups (Graham, Haidt, and Nosek 2009; Boer and Fischer 2013).
[**Several studies** have]{.underline} also [found]{.underline} that
these differences in moral foundations influence foreign policy
attitudes (Schwartz 1992; Kertzer et al. 2014; Kertzer and Rathbun
2015). In particular, [liberals]{.underline} are more \"prosocial\" and
[seek **[compromise]{.mark}**]{.underline} internationally, [in
[contrast]{.mark} to [conservatives, who]{.mark}]{.underline} are more
\"proself" and therefore **[[bargain]{.mark} more
[aggressively]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Schwartz, Caprara, and Vecchione
2010).

The second assumption is that general differences in party attitudes
appear at the elite level. There are two ways that these differences
could affect the behavior of political elites. First, the political
leaders could sincerely hold beliefs and preferences similar to those of
their constituents, leading them to have different foreign policy
strategies and goals. Alternatively, the leaders could have different
beliefs and attitudes than their constituents, but nonetheless recognize
that they must carry out their supporters\' agenda if they hope to stay
in office.

Although it is difficult to know the extent to which leaders true
foreign policy preferences reflect those of their constituents, several
observational studies show that changes in a leader\'s base correlate
with changes in their approach to international affairs. First, Mattes,
Leeds, and Carroll (2015) find that changes in the supporting coalitions
of leaders predict foreign policy change, measured by the policy
positions taken by nations in the United Nations General Assembly.
Rathbun (2004) and Haas (2005) come to a similar conclusion looking at
support for peace-enforcement missions, and [Solingen]{.underline}
(2009) [finds]{.underline} that economic interests and the
[[ideologies]{.mark} of partisan coalitions [influence nuclear
weapons]{.mark}]{.underline} policy. Therefore, [even when a leader has
different]{.underline} foreign policy [beliefs]{.underline} and goals
[than]{.underline} the rest of [the party, there may]{.underline} still
[be pressure to **toe the party line**]{.underline}.

The third assumption is that leaders from different parties can act on
their divergent preferences. This means that international and domestic
constraints on leaders cannot be so powerful that they largely limit
leaders to a single course of action. For example, some realists argue
that there is little room for leaders to have an independent impact on
foreign policy because they all need to defend and advance the national
interest (Mearsheimer 2001; Mearsheimer and Walt 2003). Regarding
domestic constraints, Trager and Vavreck (2011) find that right-wing and
left-wing leaders can have incentives to hide their \"types.\" Liberal
leaders may be forced to adopt more hawkish foreign policies because
they fear that their moderation will sometimes be interpreted as
weakness (Schultz 2005), whereas conservative leaders may have
incentives to adopt more moderate policies because the public would
likely judge them unduly aggressive if they acted hawkishly. Thus,
leader preferences and political incentives could actually push in
opposite directions.

Several **[previous studies]{.underline}** have examined whether
right-wing leaders tend to behave more aggressively in foreign policy
than left-wing leaders. Using logistic regression on panel data covering
eighteen parliamentary democracies from 1949 to 1992, Palmer, London and
Regan (2004) find that right-wing governments are more likely to be
involved in military disputes, while left-wing governments are more
likely to see the disputes in which they are involved in escalate. Their
explanation is that right-wing parties favor using force more often, so
their leaders will engage in military conflict more often. However, when
left-wing leaders engage in conflict, they will need to emerge
victorious to justify their involvement, so they will be more likely to
bargain tough and escalate if necessary. These researchers find that a
shift from left to right government increases the chances of dispute
initiation by about 50 percent and that left-wing governments are about
twice as likely to escalate conditional on being in a dispute. Second,
Arena and Palmer (2009) apply a probit model to panel data covering
twenty stable democracies from 1960 to 1996 and find that right-wing
governments are more likely to initiate disputes. Their theory is based
on the finding that right-wing leaders are less likely to be removed
from office for using force unwisely than left-wing leaders. This makes
right-wing leaders more likely to start international conflicts in the
hopes of increasing their domestic support. Third, Clare (2010) applies
logistic regression to twenty parliamentary democracies from 1950 to
1998 and finds that parliamentary democracies are about twice as likely
to initiate disputes when they are controlled by right-wing parties.

The central limitation of these studies is that their conclusions [rest
on]{.underline} the results of [**regression analysis** on
cross-national panel data]{.underline}. Such an approach is not
guaranteed to eliminate bias from omitted variables. In fact, the
results from [this]{.underline} type of [analysis can be **badly
biased**, even when researchers control for]{.underline} a wide range of
important [covariates]{.underline} (Clarke 2005). In some cases,
[[controlling for]{.underline}]{.mark} potential [[con-founders]{.mark}
can]{.underline} even **[[amplify bias]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Pearl
2013). Thus, the results from these [[past studies should be interpreted
as]{.mark} a **[tentative]{.mark} first cut**]{.underline} at answering
this question [[rather than]{.mark} the **[final]{.mark}
word**]{.underline} on the subject.

[The design]{.underline}-based approach that [we employ]{.underline} in
this article [gets around the omitted variable bias problem because the
as-if random assignment of leaders to office should create **balance**
across]{.underline} observable and unobservable [pretreatment
characteristics]{.underline}. In many other scientific fields, [the
results of **[conventional]{.mark} observational [analyses]{.mark}**
[have been overturned]{.mark}]{.underline} by design-based studies. For
example, the validity of hormone replacement therapy and a variety of
theories in development economics, psychology, and elsewhere have been
overturned when experimental and quasi-experimental approaches were
brought to bear (Women\'s Health Initiative 2002; Freedman 2009; Dunning
2012). Therefore, the tests that we present in this article provide an
important step forward in our understanding of the empirical
relationship between party control of the presidency and interstate
conflict.

Before moving on to our research design, though, we should first lay out
the hypotheses that we want to test. As we detail in our preanalysis
plan, we started this project with the belief that leaders do matter and
that electing leaders from different parties does affect the likelihood
of state aggression. Given this prior, we formulated two main
hypotheses. The first is the party ideology hypothesis, which predicts
that electing leaders from right-wing parties will increase the
likelihood of state aggression. The second hypothesis is highly general
and speaks directly to the question of whether leaders matter in
international relations. It posits that electing a leader from the
incumbent party will lead to less change in international dispute
behavior than electing a leader from a challenger party. We refer to
this as the incumbent/challenger hypothesis.

Party Ideology Hypothesis: Electing presidential candidates from
right-wing parties will make countries more aggressive than electing
candidates from left-wing parties.

Incumbent/Challenger Hypothesis: Electing candidates from challenger
parties will lead to a greater change in state aggression than electing
candidates from incumbent parties (the absolute difference in aggression
between presidential terms will be greater when there is party
turnover).

One issue that is related to the incumbent/challenger hypothesis is that
new leaders may be particularly likely to act aggressively early in
their terms. There are several reasons why this might be the case.
First, new leaders may lack the experience to manage international
crises effectively, making it more likely that disagreements with other
states will turn into military conflicts (Potter 2007). Second, new
leaders may be more likely to want to show the international community
that they are willing to use force abroad, which could strengthen their
bargaining leverage in future international negotiations (Wolford 2007;
Dafoe 2012). Third, new leaders may want to send a signal to their
domestic audiences that they are tough when it comes to foreign affairs,
which could increase their popularity at home. This idea that leaders
are more likely to get involved in military disputes when they first
arrive in office has received support from cross-national logistic
regression analysis on panel data (Gelpi and Grieco 2001) and a
mixed-methods analysis that looks at American presidents (Potter 2007).

While most of the existing theory and research on leadership transitions
has focused on cases where new leaders come to office, a similar logic
might be applied to party control of the presidency, particularly when
it comes to the reputational mechanisms. New leaders who are from the
same party as the old one should be able to associate themselves with
the previous leader\'s reputation, giving them less of a need to signal
their resolve. On the other hand, when leaders from challenger parties
come to power, there should be less certainty that the new leader will
have an approach to foreign policy that is similar to the old one\'s. In
short, when party control of the presidency changes hands, it marks a
more significant leadership transition (Mattes, Leeds, and Matsumura
2016). Thus, even if parties tend to behave pretty similarly across
ideologies, we might still find that leaders from challenger parties
might be much more aggressive early in their tenures.

Challenger Aggression Hypothesis: Electing candidates from challenger
parties will lead to an increase in state aggression when the new leader
takes office.

We did not preregister the challenger aggression hypothesis prior to
looking at the results, but this was the only hypothesis we tested
outside of those we preregis-tered. Thus, the findings do not reflect
data mining. Nevertheless, some readers may wish to interpret the test
of this particular hypothesis as exploratory.

Research Design

There are several different design-based approaches that could be used
to investigate how leaders affect state behavior. One would be to look
at all cases of leadership turnover and compare how countries behaved
before and after the leadership change. This research design rests on
the idea that countries are comparable before and after leadership
transitions. This assumption may be plausible in some cases, but in
others, it is clearly invalid. For example, the periods before and after
normal electoral leader transitions are usually not comparable. Many
countries elect the leader and members of the legislature at the same
time, making it difficult to determine the effect of leadership change
by itself. Similarly, looking at cases when leaders were forcibly
removed from office also has its limitations, since leaders are usually
removed at times of extreme political tension. Likewise, leadership
changes that are caused by assassinations are not likely to provide
valid comparisons. The new leader will probably have to deal with a more
complicated political situation in the aftermath of the assassination,
making the beginning of their term much different from the end of the
previous leader\'s term.

Another potentially promising approach would be to focus on changes in
leadership that resulted from the natural deaths of leaders. The timing
of natural leader deaths should be fairly unrelated to the domestic and
international environments. Moreover, the legislature will typically not
change following the natural death of a leader, making it much easier to
isolate the independent effect of leaders on foreign policy. However,
the natural death approach is not well-suited for this particular study.
The reason is that the new leader almost always comes from the same
party as the old leader. Thus, this exogenous change in leadership does
not provide much leverage in determining how party control of the
presidency affects interstate conflict. This research design could be
useful in looking at other types of variation in leaders, such as age,
military experience, and occupational background. However, it is not a
promising design for this study.

The approach that we take instead is to use an RD design. RD involves
comparing units that barely surpassed and barely fell short of an
important cut point that influenced treatment assignment. For example,
if there was a test where everyone who scored a fifty or higher got a
scholarship, researchers could assess the effects of getting the
scholarship by comparing the students who scored fifty and fifty-one to
the students who scored forty-eight and forty-nine. So long as there is
no sorting at the cut point, as could happen if the graders had
opportunity and motive to nudge some test takers above the cut point, it
should be close to random which of these students won the scholarship,
since they were all on the verge of getting it (Lee 2008).

Close elections provide an excellent opportunity to use RD analysis.
Given the inherent randomness in the electoral process, whether
candidates barely win or barely lose in close elections is plausibly
as-if random (Eggers et al. 2015).1 Political scientists have used RD to
study questions like how winning an election influences a party\'s
likelihood of winning the next election (Lee 2008) and how winning an
election affects a candidate\'s wealth later in life (Eggers and
Hainmueller 2009). Scholars have also used RD to test how economic and
political outcomes differ when Republican candidates for mayor barely
defeat or barely lose to Democratic candidates (Pettersson-Lidbom 2008;
Gerber and Hopkins 2011; Beland 2015; de Benedictis-Kessner and Warshaw
2016).

In this article, we look at close presidential elections. To our
knowledge, this study is the first to apply RD specifically to
presidential elections. For our analysis, we followed the procedures
that were outlined in our preanalysis plan (which is available at the
end of the Online Appendix). We will briefly summarize these procedures
in the remainder of this section.

Our Statistical Approach

There are two general ways to analyze an RD. The first, known as the
continuity approach, involves plotting two smoothing functions on either
side of the cut point and estimating the difference at the cut point
(Voeten 2014). This method should be used when the score, or \"forcing
variable,\" is continuous. The second method is the local-randomization
approach, appropriate when the forcing variable is discrete (Lee and
Card 2008; Cattaneo, Frandsen, and Titiunik 2015; Bertoli 2017). It
involves drawing a window around the cut point and treating the units
within that window like they were in a randomized experiment.

Since the forcing variable in this study is vote share in a presidential
election, which is essentially continuous, we would normally use the
continuity approach. However, we discovered in our preanalysis plan that
the continuity approach had a type 1 error rate (false-positive rate) of
12 percent for this study, which we believe is due to our small sample
size. Since the type 1 error rate should be 5 percent by design, we
chose not to use this method, since it was overly likely to give us
significant results. Instead, we used the local-randomization approach,
which we found had a type 1 error rate of about 4 percent.

Defining Close Elections

We considered elections to be close if the top two candidates were
within 2 percent of the cut point (48 percent to 52 percent range). Data
on close races were available in the data set constructed by Bertoli,
Dafoe, and Trager (2018). This data set includes every democratic
election between 1815 and 2010, where democracies are defined as
countries with Polity IV Institutionalized Democracy scores above five.
The data set provides information on the top two candidates including
their names, parties, and vote shares in the election. If there were
more than two candidates running in an election, we focused only on the
votes for the top two candidates, rescaling their vote shares
accordingly. In cases where there were runoffs, we used their vote
shares from the runoff rather than the initial election. We also
excluded close elections in nondemocracies because we were concerned
about fraud in these cases. Given the possibility of fraud, we did not
feel confident in assuming that the outcomes of these elections were
as-if random.

One complication that arose is that the United States elects presidents
through the electoral college. This system makes it possible for
candidates to lose the popular vote but still win the election if they
defeat their rival in the electoral college. To deal with this issue, we
counted the electoral college vote rather than the popular vote when
looking at the United States. This decision is consistent with other
similar studies (Bertoli, Dafoe, and Trager 2018). For every other
country, we used the popular vote.

Measuring Party Ideology

To identify parties as left or right-wing, we evaluated the parties
against each other according to their positions at the time of the
election on social questions associated with liberalism and
conservatism. Parties were judged further to the right when they
expressed support for \"traditional values,\" national, religious,
racial, or ethnic in-groups, or the benefits of authority and
traditional sources of authority such as a monarchy. Parties were judged
further to the left when they expressed inclusive sentiments, a duty of
care for vulnerable groups, and support for democratic principles.
Secondarily, we evaluated parties as left or right on economic policy
preferences. Advocacy for wealthier interests placed a candidate further
to the right, and advocacy for the less well-off is associated with the
left. These two social and economic dimensions are highly correlated,
with the principal exceptions coming from communist and postcommunist
countries. In these cases, the primary social dimension determined the
left-right coding. When parties could not be easily classified as left
or right according to these metrics, we excluded the election from the
ideology test.

Main Analyses

We looked at two different types of close elections. The first were
close elections between right-wing and left-wing parties, where it was
essentially random whether the presidency was controlled by a leader
with a right-wing or left-wing ideology. In total, we have twenty-nine
close elections between right-wing and left-wing parties. The second set
of close elections that we analyzed was narrow races between an
incumbent and challenger party. In these cases, it was as-if random
whether the country experienced party continuity or change in the
executive branch. We have thirty-six of these close elections in our
data set. For this group of cases, we were particularly interested in
testing whether a change in party control of the presidency increased
the likelihood of a change in state aggression.

Although our sample sizes are not large, the power tests that we ran at
the beginning of this project indicated that we had a good chance of
picking up a medium-sized or large effect. For the test of left- versus
right-wing parties, we determined we would correctly detect (at a = .05)
a medium-sized effect (0.5 standard deviation \[SD\]) 30 percent of the
time, a large effect (0.8 SD) 54 percent of the time, and a very large
effect (1.2 SD) 82 percent of the time. In the incumbency power
analysis, we found that we would detect a medium-sized effect 55 percent
of the time, a large effect 93 percent of the time, and a very large
effect over 99 percent of the time. Also, if the effects were small or
nonexistent, the power tests indicated that we would be able to
establish confidence intervals that were precise enough to rule out very
large (+1.2 SD) positive and negative effects.2

Moreover, although the results turn out to be significant at
conventional levels, we encourage readers to avoid interpreting p values
as either significant (p \< .05) or not while reading this article and
to bear the bias-variance trade-off in research design in mind. Almost
all quantitative research in international relations lacks any claim to
strong causal identification, being based on observational data and
linear adjustment of largely ad hoc covariate sets. By contrast, the
design presented here has a strong claim to causal identification and
unbiasedness, providing a crucial complement to the vast majority of the
literature which does not. Thus, since p values provide a continuous
measure of how inconsistent the evidence is with the null hypothesis, a
higher p value in an unbiased design may actually reflect more evidence
against the null than a lower p value in a biased one. Small p values
(e.g., p \< .2), even if not significant at conventional standards, also
provide important evidence in these contexts.

In addition to our two main tests, we examined whether candidates from
challenger parties are more likely to initiate military disputes at the
beginning of their terms than candidates from incumbent parties, which
would be consistent with the theory that major leadership transitions
make state aggression more likely. Our motivation for running this test
came from reading Wolford (2007), Dafoe (2012), and Wu and Wolford
(2016). These articles advance a compelling theory and intriguing
empirical evidence that new leaders have reputational incentives to act
tough when they first come to office. We find strong evidence consistent
with this hypothesis.

Outcomes

We measured aggression using the number of militarized interstate
disputes (MIDs) that a country initiates. These disputes are cases where
countries explicitly threatened, displayed, or used force against other
states (Ghosn, Palmer, and Bremer 2004). Specifically, we look at the
number of these disputes that a state initiated starting from when the
leader took office and ending at the date that the winner of the next
election was scheduled to start. In cases where leaders were replaced
part of the way through their term, we used the day that they left
office instead. Since the length of time that candidates held office
varied, we divided the total number of disputes by the duration of the
time period. Thus, the unit of measurement is military disputes
initiated per year in office.

We use slightly different versions of the outcome variables for our
different tests. For the ideology test, we use military disputes
initiated per year, as described in the previous paragraph. For the main
incumbency test, we use the absolute change in military disputes
initiated per year from the previous term. We use this variable because
we are interested in evaluating whether there was a larger absolute
change in military aggression when the challenger party barely won.
Thus, the measure is:

Absolute change in military aggression =\|MIDs/year during winner\'s
term

---MIDs/year during previous term\|

In other words, we are testing whether challenger parties gaining
control of the presidency makes countries with high levels of prior
aggression more likely to experience a decrease in dispute initiation
and countries with low levels of prior aggression more likely to
experience an increase in dispute initiation. We conduct a one-sided
test for this analysis, since we expect that the absolute change will be
larger for countries where the challenger party barely wins. Lastly, for
the exploratory test about whether challenger candidates tend to be more
aggressive when they first take office, we look at the number of
disputes that each country initiated in the first year of the new
presidential term.

Across these tests, our main outcomes are (1) military disputes
initiated and (2) high-level military disputes initiated. High-level
disputes are cases where countries used force against other states or
entered into international wars.3 Following the preanalysis plan, we
examine high-level disputes, which constitute actual uses of force,
separately because the factors that drive posturing may be different
from those that drive actual violence. As secondary outcomes, we look at
(3) all disputes that countries engaged in and (4) all high-level
disputes that countries engaged in. These cases include disputes that
countries did not start but participated in nonetheless.

Estimation

We employ two estimation strategies. Our primary statistical analysis
involves t tests. This is a simple approach, recommended for its
parsimony and robustness, which is appropriate given the assumption that
close elections were as-if random (Dunning 2012). As a secondary test,
we plot the outcome as a function of the electoral result and estimate
how the expected value of the outcome changes at the cut point using
local linear regression, as is often done for RD designs. An advantage
with using this approach is that it makes it possible to visualize how
outcomes change at the cut point.

Design Checks

Our research design rests on one main assumption, necessary for
internally valid estimates: the outcomes of the close elections
considered in this study are as-if random. For example, the design would
be invalid if any candidates could precisely manipulate their vote
shares around the cut point, such as by counting the votes and adding
just enough to win. This assumption should be valid for democracies
provided that elections are fair (Eggers et al. 2015).

A second \"representativeness\" assumption facilitates generalizing from
our results, and this is that the democracy years experiencing close
elections are not dissimilar to democracy years in which elections are
not close. If this assumption is reasonable, then we can generalize from
our results to all democracy years. However, if the countries that had
close elections are not representative of other democracies, then the
causal estimates that we find may not reflect broader patterns in
international relations.

We can test the as-if randomness assumption in two ways. First, we can
check that the samples are balanced on important pretreatment
characteristics. Figure 1 plots the balance using two-sided t tests. The
graph on the left shows that countries where right-wing parties barely
won were very similar to countries where left-wing parties barely won,
and the graph on the right shows that countries where incumbent parties
barely won were similar to countries where challenger parties barely
won. In Figure 1, we look at twenty-four covariates, and not a single
one is significantly imbalanced. Thus, the data are consistent with the
assumption that who won these close elections was as-if random.

\[Figure One Omitted\]

\[Figure Two Omitted\]

Second, we can test whether there is balance in the number of cases on
either side of the cut point. Figure 2 shows how close right-wing and
incumbent parties were to winning the presidency. For the twenty-nine
close elections between right-wing and left-wing parties, there were
sixteen cases where the right-wing party won and thirteen cases where
the left-wing party won (p = .71). Similarly, for the thirty-six close
elections between incumbent and challenger parties, there were seventeen
cases where the incumbent party won and nineteen cases where the
challenger party won (p = .87). Thus, there is no evidence of sorting in
either sample.

\[Figure Three Omitted\]

We can also evaluate the external validity assumption by comparing the
two samples to the broader population of all democracies since 1815.
Figure 3 uses box-plots to compare our samples to the broader population
with respect to covariates related to military power. The comparisons
show that our samples are very similar to the broader population of
democracies from 1815 to 2010. Thus, at least with respect to these
covariates, there is little reason to believe that either of our samples
consist of an idiosyncratic group of countries that would behave
differently than most other democracies. Rather, the representativeness
of our samples indicates that our results should be indicative of
broader trends in international relations.

In sum, the outcomes of the close elections appear to be random, and the
countries where the close elections happened are fairly representative
of all other democracies. Therefore, the design appears to have worked
very well. In the next two sections, we will look at how electing
presidential candidates from different parties affects state aggression
using this new empirical approach.

Results for Party Ideology

Our results indicate that [right-wing parties tend to be **more
aggressive** than left-wing parties]{.underline}. Table 1 shows the
aggression levels of the countries that had close elections between
right-wing and left-wing candidates. On average, the countries where
right-wing parties barely won started .06 more disputes per year than
countries where left-wing parties barely won. Similarly, they engaged in
.10 more high-level disputes per year than countries where left-wing
parties barely won. Given that the average duration of a presidential
term for these countries is 4 years and 169 days, this adds up to .32
more disputes initiated and .43 more high-level disputes initiated over
an average presidential term.

Figure 4 plots the estimates for the two main outcome variables along
with the two other indicators of aggression. The **[confidence
intervals]{.underline}** are based on two-tailed t tests. They
[suggest]{.underline} that [electing right-wing parties does increase
state aggression]{.underline}, particularly when it comes to high-level
disputes. Of course, all of these confidence intervals cover zero, so we
cannot rule out zero effect with 95 percent confidence based on this
analysis alone. The estimate most different from zero is of high-level
disputes initiated (p = .25). For disputes initiated, the results appear
to be more consistent with no effect (p = .64), as do the results for
the supplemental tests of all disputes and all high-level disputes.

\[Table One Omitted\]

\[Figure Four Omitted\]

However, [if we look at]{.underline} the **[specific
disputes]{.underline}** in more detail, [the evidence]{.underline} that
electing right-wing leaders increases state aggression [grows
stronger]{.underline}. While [[all]{.underline}]{.mark} the high-level
[[disputes]{.mark} that]{.underline} the [right-wing leaders engaged in
[involved **unequivocal**]{.mark} **uses of
[force]{.mark}**]{.underline}, the only high-level dispute that any of
the left-wing leaders initiated is questionable and should probably be
excluded. This dispute was between Costa Rica and Nicaragua in 1995, and
it did not involve any military action by either country. Costa Rican
police crossed the Nicaraguan border in pursuit of suspects and were
arrested. Two days later, the Costa Rican police force retaliated by
arresting two Nicaraguan police officers who had crossed the border \"to
get a drink of water.\" The two sides made a prisoner swap on the
following day. If this case is dropped, then electing right-wing parties
appears to lead countries to initiate . 12 more high-level disputes per
year (p = .162).4

Moreover, the only reason that these results are not significant is
because the United States (2001) is an outlier, which inflates the
standard errors. We can address this issue by [modifying the outcome to
a **simple indicator variable**]{.underline} for whether countries
initiated any high-level disputes ([no]{.underline} = 0,
[yes]{.underline} = 1), which [makes our test **insensitive to
outliers**]{.underline}. The estimates then suggest that electing
right-wing parties increases the chances that countries will initiate
high-level military disputes by 25 percent (p = .041). Therefore, even
though the initial tests were not statistically significant, they become
more conclusive after we address some minor issues with the data.

Given the number of democracies in the world today, there may be enough
close elections to get much more precise estimates a decade or two from
now or maybe even after the next expansion of the MID data set. This
design is definitely worth returning to in the near future. However, for
the present, we will turn to a second test in the next section on more
data that yields increased statistical power. This test provides further
evidence that which party controls the presidency does affect the
likelihood of state aggression.

Results for Incumbent versus Challenger Parties

The second test that we run compares cases where challenger parties
barely defeated incumbent parties to cases where they barely lost to
incumbent parties. In these cases, it was as-if random whether the
incumbent or challenger party won. Thus, we can test how much military
aggression changes when the party that controls the executive branch
changes. The outcomes that we use for this test are the absolute changes
in the military indicators between the term when the incumbent or
challenger party barely won and the previous term. For this analysis, we
use one-sided tests that assume that there will tend to be a larger
change in military aggression when the challenger party barely wins.

Table 2 shows the absolute change in aggression levels for the countries
that had close elections between candidates from incumbent and
challenger parties. [[When the]{.underline}]{.mark} candidates from
[[challenger]{.underline}]{.mark} parties barely
[[won]{.underline}]{.mark}, the absolute change in disputes initiated
per year was .031 greater than when candidates from incumbent parties
barely won (p = .30; 26 percent increase from baseline). For high-level
disputes, the difference is even more notable. The absolute change in
[[**high-level disputes** initiated]{.underline}]{.mark} per year
[[was]{.underline}]{.mark} .074 greater than when candidates from
incumbent parties barely won (p = .046, [[133 percent increase]{.mark}
from baseline]{.underline}). The average length of the presidential
terms for these data was 4.42 years, so this adds up to a difference of
.33 high-level disputes initiated per presidential term. Figure 5 plots
the confidence intervals for the aggression indicators.

[This]{.underline} estimated [effect is **substantively large** relative
to other determinants of conflict]{.underline} that international
relations scholars have analyzed. For example, past studies have found
that revolutions increase the likelihood that countries will initiate
military disputes by about 74 percent (Colgan 2010), arms transfers by
about 60 percent (Krause 2004), and neutrality pacts with potential
conflict joiners by about 57 percent (Leeds 2003). The effect of
challenger parties winning appears to be in the ballpark of these
estimates, although it is hard to nail down this effect very precisely
because of the relatively small sample size.

Figure 6 illustrates the effect for high-level disputes across a greater
range of margins of victory. As countries move from incumbent party
victories (the points on the left) to challenger party victories (the
points on the right), there is a large shift in the absolute change in
high-level disputes initiated. Countries where the challenger party
barely won experienced a much larger change than countries where the
incumbent party barely won. Although this method of estimating the
treatment effect was not the primary method that we discussed in our
preanalysis plan, the [results]{.underline} for this approach [are
**fairly conclusive**]{.underline}.

**[A U.S. [Navy warship fired]{.mark} a [warning flare to wave off an
Iranian]{.mark} Revolutionary Guard [speedboat]{.mark} coming straight
at it during a tense [encounter]{.mark} in the strategic Strait of
Hormuz]{.underline}**, officials said Tuesday. The incident on Monday
involving the Guard and the **[Navy [comes as tensions remain high over

**[Meanwhile, the [U]{.mark}nited [N]{.mark}ations\' nuclear watchdog
[said Iran now plans to enrich uranium]{.mark} through a second set of
advanced centrifuges]{.underline}** at its underground Fordo facility
amid the standoff.

The Cyclone-class patrol ship USS Sirocco and Spearhead-class
expeditionary fast transport USNS Choctaw County found themselves in the
close encounter with three Iranian fast boats while coming through the
Strait of Hormuz to enter the Persian Gulf, the Navy said.

In a video released by the Navy\'s Bahrain-based 5th Fleet, a high-speed
Guard Boghammar is seen turning head-on toward the Sirocco. The Sirocco
repeatedly blows its horn at the Boghammar, which turns away as it
closes in. **[The flare shot can be heard, but not seen, as the
Boghammar passes the Sirocco with the Iranian flag flying above
it]{.underline}**.

The Navy said the Boghammar came within 50 yards of the Sirocco, raising
the risk of the vessels running into each other. The overall encounter
lasted about an hour, the Navy said.

**[The [Guard\'s \"actions did not meet international standards of
professional or safe maritime behavior]{.mark},]{.underline}**
increasing the risk of miscalculation and collision,\" the Navy said.

**[[Iran did not]{.mark} immediately [acknowledge the incident]{.mark}

this marked the second so-called \"unsafe and unprofessional\"

TEHRAN, Iran (AP) --- **[Two members of the paramilitary Revolutionary

high-ranking Guard members amid the growing crisis.

The semiofficial Fars and Tasnim news agencies, believed to be close to
the Guard, identified one of the dead as Ali Kamani and said he died in
Iran's central city of Khomein. Tasnim said that Kamani died in a "car

### 2AC \-\-- Iran Uses Mines

#### Mines are the most likely weapon to cut off the Strait

TNI Staff 21, for over almost three decades, The National Interest,
founded in 1985 by Irving Kristol and Owen Harries, has displayed a
remarkable consistency in its approach to foreign policy, 10/24/21,
"Iran\'s Antiquated Mines Could Sink a U.S. Aircraft Carrier," *The
National Interest*,
<https://nationalinterest.org/blog/reboot/irans-antiquated-mines-could-sink-us-aircraft-carrier-195380>,
JH

Here\'s What You Need to Remember: **[[Iran's]{.mark} [most]{.mark}
[effective]{.mark} and proven [weapon to cut off the Straits]{.mark} of
Hormuz are likely [to be sea mines.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

The United States is accusing Iran of testing rockets near one of its
aircraft carriers in the Persian Gulf as it passed through the Straits
of Hormuz. U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) denounced the Iranian actions
as "highly provocative." **[But could Iran actually sink one of the U.S.
Navy's mighty flattops?]{.underline}**

**[According to CENTCOM, Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) naval
vessels conducted live-fire drills less than 1,500 yards away from
the Nimitz-class carrier USS Harry S. Truman (CVN-75), the Arleigh
Burke-class destroyer USS Bulkeley (DDG-84) destroyer and the French
frigate FS Provence on Saturday]{.underline}**. Moreover, **[civilian
shipping traffic was in the area]{.underline}**.

"**[Firing weapons so close to passing coalition ships and commercial
traffic within an internationally recognized maritime traffic lane is
unsafe, unprofessional and inconsistent with international maritime
law]{.underline}**," said CENTCOM spokesman Commander Kyle Raines in a
statement. He noted, however, that the Iranians were clearly not firing
in the direction of the U.S. ships.

**[The Straits of [Hormuz]{.mark} are a [natural chokepoint for
entry]{.mark} into the Persian Gulf. The channel is only about
twenty-one miles wide at its narrowest while the shipping lane is about
two miles wide]{.underline}**. There is also a two-mile buffer zone on
either side of the sea lane. **[The [narrow straits are an ideal
point]{.mark} for Tehran [to make an attempt at blocking access]{.mark}
to the Persian Gulf or to ambush allied naval forces---which indeed it
attempted during the 1980s.]{.underline}**

According to CENTCOM, the handful of IRGC vessels fired unguided
rockets---which are not especially threatening to a vessel the size of
USS Harry S. Truman in small numbers. **[However, a lucky shot could
have damaged the massive ship and the aircraft carried
onboard]{.underline}**. At such close range, even unguided weapons have
a decent chance of hitting a target. At best, the Iranian boats might
have achieved a "mission kill" on the U.S. and French vessels. It's very
unlikely that the IRGC vessels could have actually sunk Harry S.
Truman or its escorts.

**[[Iranian]{.mark} [forces]{.mark} would have [had to employ
their]{.mark} small [attack craft]{.mark} en masse to have a chance of
doing real damage to the U.S. Navy task force]{.underline}**---as the
Millennium Challenge 2002 simulation demonstrated. Indeed, the IRGC has
rehearsed such an attack on a mock-up of the USS Nimitz in the Straits
of Hormuz in previously during an exercise called [\"Ninth Great
Prophet.\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=widl5Tz4QfA)

Those Iranian drills involved hordes of speedboats armed with cruise
missiles and rockets, medium- and large-caliber torpedoes, sea mines,
heavy machine guns and shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles. Those
swarming boats were coupled with shored-based missiles and other
weapons. The U.S. Navy's Littoral Combat Ship program---specifically,
its surface warfare module---was developed to counter the Iranian
swarming boat threat, but the service has yet to arm those vessels with
an appropriate missile system.

While the swarming boat concept might work in exercises and simulations,
it has never been demonstrated during a real war. **[[Iran's most
effective]{.mark} and proven [weapon]{.mark} to cut off the Straits of
Hormuz are [likely to be sea mines]{.mark}. Sea mines have [sunk or
disabled the majority of the]{.mark} nineteen U.S. Navy [vessels]{.mark}
lost since World War II. Of those nineteen ships, fifteen vessels were
victims of sea mines.]{.underline}** Indeed, an Iranian sea mine---an
antique World War I design, no less---nearly sank the frigate USS Samuel
B. Roberts (FFG 58) on April 14, 1988.

**[More recently, during the 1991 Gulf War, Iraqi [sea mines proved to
be a vexing problem for the U.S. Navy]{.mark}. "In February 1991, the
U.S. Navy lost command of the northern Arabian Gulf to more than 1,300
mines that had been sown by Iraqi forces virtually under the 'noses' of
multinational coalition naval forces constrained by their rules of
engagement]{.underline}**," [wrote naval warfare guru Scott
Truver,](https://www.usnwc.edu/getattachment/19669a3b-6795-406c-8924-106d7a5adb93/Taking-Mines-Seriously--Mine-Warfare-in-China-s-Ne) director

[cruiser]{.mark} USS Princeton]{.underline}** (CG 59) and the Iwo
Jima-class amphibious assault ship USS Tripoli (LPH-10) on the same day
during that conflict. The mines cost less than \$25,000 each.

#### Iran seeks to escalate tensions with mine warfare

Seth J. **Frantzman 19**, Seth J. Frantzman is Senior Middle East
Correspondent and Middle East affairs analyst at The Jerusalem Post and
received his Ph.D from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 2010,
6/13/19, "Pompeo: Iran behind tanker strike, part of campaign to
\'escalate tension\',"
<https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/incident-in-gulf-of-oman-explosions-affect-two-oil-tankers-report-592351>,
JH

**[[Iran]{.mark} was likely [behind a coordinated attack on two
tankers]{.mark} in the Gulf of Oman early Thursday morning, the United
States said, [as "limpet mines" were spotted]{.mark} on one of the
wrecked ships.]{.underline}**

**[The attack comes a month after four tankers were sabotaged off the
United Arab Emirates]{.underline}** in May and will raise US-Iran
tensions to their worst point in years.

**[US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the attack on two oil tankers
on June 13 was one in a list of Iranian and Iranian-backed attacks over
the last month]{.underline}**. It was a "clear threat to peace, security
and freedom of navigation," he said, asserting that Iran was disrupting
world oil markets and that the international community condemns the
assault. The US has instructed its UN ambassador to raise the attack at
the UN. "**[[The US will defend its force, interests, partners and
allies.]{.mark} We call upon all nations threatened to join us in that
endeavor]{.underline}**."

**[The attacks began after 6 a.m. in the morning when the US Fifth Fleet
heard a distress call from a tanker in the Gulf of Oman that had exited
the Strait of Hormuz]{.underline}**. Forty-five minutes later another
distress call was made. Two tankers, the Kokuka Courageous, which had
left the Saudi Arabian port of Al Jubail on June 10, and the Front
Altair, which had left UAE port of Ruwais with 75,000 tonnes of Naphta
on board, were in damaged by explosions. **[The Kokuka Courageous had
been attacked twice, according to numerous reports, while the Front
Altair was on fire and its starboard side blackened from the bridge to
half-way down its lengthwise bulkhead.]{.underline}**

In Oman and Pakistan locals received reports of the explosions and
passed them on to Iran's Al-Alam TV which soon broadcast the first
reports. Iranian-linked media pushed the story and were soon running
images of one of the tankers on fire and even posted dated video of a
different attack by Iranian-backed Houthis on a Saudi ship from 2017.

Iran's Foreign Minister Javad Zarif was nonplussed, calling the incident
"suspicious" as it took place during a historic state visit of Japanese
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe**[. [It also comes amid tensions]{.mark} with
the US [and US threats to retaliate for any Iranian
attacks.]{.mark}]{.underline}** The US said Iran was "almost certainly"
responsible for attacks last month on four tankers. But this incident on
June 13 was far more serious, forcing the evacuation of the ships.

The USS Bainbridge assisted in the rescue of 21 crew from one of the
tankers, CNN reported. A US Navy P-8, **[which carried surveillance and
anti-submarine warfare systems, was dispatched to the
scene]{.underline}**. The P-8 would have taken almost an hour to reach
the area and likely by the time it got there whoever had carried out the
attack was gone. The USS Bainbridge is a guided-missile destroyer which
was sent with the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group toward the
Persian Gulf in early May. **[It was sent during the rising tensions
with Iran after US National Security Advisor John [Bolton threatened
retaliation for any Iranian, or Iranian proxy, attacks on the US or US
allies.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

CBS reported that a US Defense official told correspondent David Martin
that it was "highly likely Iran caused these attacks." **[CNN reported
that the crew of the Bainbridge saw an "[unexploded mine" attached to
one of the ships]{.mark} that was harmed.]{.underline}**

Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov warned against "hasty
attempts to pin the blame" after the attack. France also said it was
disturbed by the incident, linking it with a cruise missile attack on a
Saudi airport earlier this week. That attack was carried out by the
Houthis against an airport on June 12.

**[The attack on the tankers was "well planned and coordinated," the
International Association of Independent Tanker Owners
said]{.underline}**. All forty-four crew from the two ships were rescued
by the afternoon. Iranian media reported that Iran had rescued the crew
and that the Front Altier had sunk, but the US said that in fact the
Bainbridge had rescued the 21 sailors of one of the ships, apparently
from the Kokuka Courageous. The Front Altair had not sunk, although
damage to it was significant**[. [A magnetic mine was fingered as the
culprit behind the damage]{.mark} to the Kokuka Courageous which claimed
to have suffered two attacks]{.underline}**. Smoke belching from the
Front Altair was visible from satellites in the afternoon.

US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was expected to speak about the
incident in the afternoon on Tuesday. It is the third serious incident
since the US threatened against Iranian aggression in May. It comes in
the wake of the May 12 sabotage on four tankers and the May 19 rocket
attack near the US embassy in Baghdad.

Iran meanwhile has been seeking to ease tensions with the US with visits
by the German foreign minister this week and also Japan's Prime
Minister.

The price of crude oil jumped after the attacks, rising four percent to
at least \$62. Around thirty percent of the world's seaborne crude oil
passes through the Strait of Hormuz, according to the chairman of the
INTERTANKO tanker association. Iran has threatened in the past to close
the Straits, most recently in comments by an Iranian naval commander in
April. Iran also has a naval base only twenty miles from the attack on
the two ships at the port of Jask. The base has been used to drill
Iranian submarines and anti-ship missiles in the past. **[As recently as
February [Iran demonstrated its latest missiles and naval
power]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

#### Iran submarines/mines

4/5/17, "'This Presence will Continue Forever': An Assessment of Iranian
Naval Capabilities in the Red Sea," <https://cimsec.org/tag/mines/>, JH

Sinc e 1988, the **[main effort by the [Iranian naval leadership has
concentrated on building up]{.mark} Iran's asymmetric capabilities,
including acquiring a [strong submarine
force]{.mark}]{.underline}**.38 Although most of Iran's submarines are
small or midget craft designed for operations in the shallow waters of
Persian Gulf, Iran does possess at least four blue-water submarines.39

Three of these are diesel-electric Kilo­-class submarines, purchased from
Russia in the 1990s.40 The Kilo-class was designed as a quiet attack
submarine, but because they were intended for colder climates, Iran's
three Kilos do not operate well in the warm waters of the Persian Gulf.
**[For this reason, whilst they are currently based in the main Iranian
naval station at Bandar Abbas [in the Strait of Hormuz, a new submarine
base]{.mark} for them is reportedly under construction at Chah Bahar on
the Gulf of Oman]{.underline}**.41 Not much is yet known about the
fourth submarine, the lead boat of the domestically-produced
Fateh-class, but it is designed for service in blue water.42

**[The three [Kilo submarines represent Iran's]{.mark} main operating
[capability in the Red Sea]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Whilst its surface
ships are hampered by their vulnerability to air attack and small
operating range, the Kilo-class submarine is designed for extended
operations in open waters.43 **[Each Kilo is thought to be armed with
wake-homing torpedoes, and they [can carry]{.mark} a total payload of 24
[mines]{.mark}, deployable through the torpedo tubes]{.underline}**.44 A
batch of 1,000 mines was included in the original purchase from
Russia.45

**[Since then, Iran is estimated to have built up a stockpile of at
least 2,000 mines]{.underline}**, including the M-08 contact mine, the
MDM-6 pressure mine, and the EM-52 smart mine.46 The Red Sea and the
Bab-el-Mandeb Strait are too deep for the M-08 contact mine, which
operates at depths of up to 110 meters, but potentially within the range
for both the MDM-6 and EM-52.47 **[The EM-52 is a particularly lethal
threat, as it is laid on the sea floor and is a guided, rocket-propelled
warhead. It is also powerful enough to penetrate a carrier
hull.]{.underline}**48

**[Seafloor mines are especially challenging to detect; it took a Royal
Navy minesweeper six days to detect a single Iranian smart mine in the
Red Sea]{.underline}** in the 1980s.49 Caitlin Talmadge, in her analysis
of Iranian capabilities in the Strait of Hormuz, **[calculated that a
task force of 12 NATO ships managed to clear an Iraqi minefield at a
rate of 1.18 mines per day, a rate that was unusually fast and done
under ideal conditions.]{.underline}**50 Given the rugged geography of
the Red Sea's floor and the proliferation of smart mines, it is not
clear whether another task force would be able to clear an Iranian
minefield at the same rate.

However, the Kilo class is aging, and these vessels are vulnerable to
U.S. and British hunter-killer groups. **[The proximity of Western
forces to the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait and the strategic importance of the
Red Sea to Western interests suggests that the Kilo submarines would
probably only get one voyage to the Red Sea before being neutralized in
the case of hostilities]{.underline}**. If Iran deployed all three of
its blue-water submarines, which is unlikely, they could sow 72 mines at
most. If a naval task force was to achieve the same rate of minesweeping
as in Talmadge's analysis, it would take 61 days to clear this minefield
completely. Nevertheless, it is improbable that the Iranian leadership
would risk all three of its largest submarines on such a risky, possibly
one-way mission, and similarly it is unlikely that minesweepers would be
able to operate with the same speed in the Red Sea as in the Persian
Gulf. **[Therefore, a rough estimate of Iran's submarine capabilities
and mine stock would indicate that a single Kilo submarine with a
well-trained crew could close the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait for at least a
week in an attempt to divert attention away from combat in the Persian
Gulf.]{.underline}**

Despite the willingness of Iran\'s new President, Hassan Rouhani to make
all reasonable concessions to US demands, Israeli pressure groups in
Washington continue to demand **[[an attack on
Iran]{.underline}]{.mark}**. But such an attack **[[might escalate into
a global nuclear war]{.underline}]{.mark}**, with catastrophic
consequences. As we approach the 100th anniversary World War I, we
should remember that this colossal disaster escalated uncontrollably
from what was intended to be a minor conflict. There is a danger that an
attack on Iran would escalate into a large-scale war in the Middle East,
entirely destabilizing a region that is already deep in problems. The
unstable government of **[[Pakistan might be overthrown]{.mark}, and the
revolutionary [Pakistan]{.mark}i government [might enter]{.mark} the war

through long-lasting radioactive contamination, **[a nuclear war
would]{.underline}** damage **[global agriculture to such a extent that
a global famine]{.underline}** of previously unknown proportions
**[would result]{.underline}**. Thus, **[nuclear war is the ultimate

#### US and Russia get drawn in -- ensures accidents

How Great-Power Wars Get Started," 6/21/17.
https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/06/21/this-is-how-great-power-wars-get-started/

Are **[[the U.S. and Russia]{.mark} being [sucked into]{.mark} war [in
the Middle East]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and if so, how can escalation be
averted? The present political dynamics in the Middle East are unsettled
and kaleidoscopic. But in the interests of brevity, leaving aside
smaller players, and before we think about the role of the United States
and Russia, the basic configurations of power in the region since the
2011 Arab Spring can be simplified in terms of five loose groupings.
First, a grouping of Sunni monarchies (Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates, Jordan, and Bahrain); Arab secular nationalists (Egypt since
President Abdel Fatteh el-Sisi took over in 2013, Algeria, Morocco, and
Tunisia); and Gen. Khalifa Haftar's faction in eastern Libya. Second, a
grouping of Turkey; Qatar; and Muslim Brotherhood affiliates such as
Hamas in Gaza, Egypt under President Morsi before 2013, and the
internationally-recognized Libyan government based in the western part
of that country. Third, a grouping of Iran and its Shiite allies,
including Iraq (at least among key factions of the Baghdad government),
the Assad regime in Syria, and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Fourth, the
collection of various Sunni jihadi networks, including the Islamic
State, various al Qaeda affiliates, and any number of smaller factions.
Fifth, there is Israel, which does not fit into any of the above, but is
most closely aligned with members of the first grouping. Three key
stories since the 2011 Arab Spring broadly explain how the United States
and Russia fit into these dynamics, and why these two great powers are
being dragged into confrontation in the Middle East. The first story is
**[the tension between human rights and stability. Initially motivated
by humanitarian impulse, the United States and its Western allies
achieved regime change in Libya and attempted it in Syria, by backing
rebels in each case. These rebellions rapidly became infected by radical
Islamists, giving Russia the opportunity,]{.underline}** not
unreasonably, **[to claim that]{.underline}**, in the interest of
preventing Islamist chaos, **[it was backing strongmen on the opposite
side (]{.underline}**Haftar in Libya and Assad in Syria). Egypt is a
similar case. Russia took advantage of the Obama administration's
aversion to the Sisi regime's human rights abuses following the
overthrow of Muslim Brotherhood rule to increase Russian influence in
Cairo, as exemplified by Egypt's current diplomatic support for the
Russian intervention in Syria. The second story is the 2015 Iran nuclear
deal brokered by the Obama administration, and reluctantly accepted by
the Trump administration, whose advocates claimed that it was the best
way to stop Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon without the resort to
force. Russia joined sanctions against Iran, but since they were lifted,
Moscow has developed warmer relations with Tehran, as exemplified by the
way it acted as a key broker between Saudi Arabia and Iran to set up the
November 2016 OPEC agreement. By contrast **[with Moscow, the
[Trump]{.mark} administration [has taken a hard-line stance toward
Tehran]{.mark}]{.underline}**. It has various motives for that shift:
**[Iranian missile testing since the deal was signed; Iranian support
for Shiite militia groups in Iraq, Syria, Yemen, and Lebanon; and a
belief that traditional U.S. allies such as Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and
Israel are in need of greater support]{.underline}** (notwithstanding
that many Israelis supported the nuclear deal). The third story is the
role that **[radical Sunni Islamist networks now play in the region,
enabled by social media and other online tools that facilitate
networking]{.underline}**. One simply cannot explain the speed and scale
at which the Islamic State formed, for example, without that network
effect. These fluid jihadi networks have proved effective in exploiting
tears in the fabric of order in fragile states, and then governing
captured ground, predominantly in areas with Sunni majority populations,
above all in western Iraq, northern Syria, and southern Yemen. When one
puts these three stories together, **[we see the nexus of the current
U.S.- Russia standoff in Syria]{.underline}**.When one puts these three
stories together, we see the nexus of the current U.S.- Russia standoff
in Syria. At the center of the nexus is the fact that while the U.S.-led
coalition has done a good job of beating back the Islamic State in Iraq
and Syria, the policy goal under both the Obama and Trump
administrations has only been negatively defined as the defeat of the
Islamic State. Neither administration has set out a positive vision for
who will govern territory cleared of the Islamic State. In other words,
the U.S. has a military strategy without a political counterpart --- and
the more the Islamic State's territorial control has been squeezed, the
more evident the absence of U.S. political strategy has become. Enter
the Trump administration, which in keeping with its broader hard-line
stance toward Iran, has been consistently clear about who it does not
want to govern r-captured ground, namely, Iran-backed Shiite militias,
who form a large part both of Assad's ground forces and indeed
Baghdad's. Hence the **[Trump]{.underline}** administration **[has taken
the view that both Sunni jihadi groups and Shiite militias should be
grouped under the same category of radical Islamic
terrorism]{.underline}**. Consistent with this, it has stepped up action
against Shiite paramilitary groups in Syria. Furthermore, the
administration's hard-line attitude, conveyed by Trump in his visit to
Riyadh in May, encouraged the blockade of Qatar by Saudi Arabia, the
UAE, Bahrain, and Egypt, on the basis of alleged Qatari support for
Iranian proxies. But the glaring absence of a U.S. positive political
vision in the Middle East has left its negatively defined anti-Islamic
State and anti-Iranian goals untethered, which has generated regional
confusion. Imagine a sheepdog who is good at barking, but has little
sense of direction: The Middle East is now in the position of its
harried flock. **[Even the administration itself seemed confused about
how to respond to the implications of its own strategy, as was clear
from its plainly contradictory signals on the Qatar crisis: While
President Trump initially enthusiastically endorsed the blockade of
Qatar in public, his national security team sought to de-escalate it
behind the scenes]{.underline}**, and this calmer line seems to be
prevailing. So, **[what does Washington positively want? Who
knows]{.underline}**.So, what does Washington positively want? Who
knows. Although the most likely outcome of the Qatar crisis at this
point is a U.S. brokered de-escalation, it is likely that a jilted Doha
will subsequently look to become less dependent on the United States by
building up existing relations with Turkey, which already has a base in
Doha; Russia, which already has strong commercial links with the emirate
(Qatar owns a large stake in Rosneft, for example); and Iran, with whom
it needs good relations given the need to cooperate over the shared
exploitation of natural gas fields in the Persian Gulf. The limits of
having no positive political strategy are also evident in Iraq and
Syria. In Iraq, the United States military has effectively helped clear
ground for Iranian Shiite militias to backfill, which contradicts the
administration's anti-Iranian position. The only real alternative is to
support a greater governance role for Kurdish groups, potentially as
part of an enlarged independent Kurdish state. But so far, the U.S.
position has been to support the unity of Iraq. In Syria, the situation
is more complex, because unlike the Iraqi Kurds, who have reasonably
good relations with Ankara, the Turkish government is vehemently opposed
to any kind of independent Kurdish state in northern Syria. But the
U.S.-led coalition overwhelmingly relies on Kurdish ground forces in
Syria, and they hold most of the ground cleared from the Islamic State.
Does the United States support a Kurdish state in northern Syria? We
don't know. Has it provided any alternative to a Kurdish state in
northern Syria? No. Is the territory still legally part of Syria? Yes.
Unsurprisingly, there is serious confusion on the ground, which has
produced the U.S.-Russian escalation we see today. So back to the
original question: **[Are we are headed toward a great-power conflict in
the middle east?]{.underline}** In my view, **[until the U.S. presents a
positive political strategy, [we will continue to have direct clashes
between Russian-supported Shiite militias and U.S.
forces]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, **[which may well produce an
accident]{.underline}** ]{.mark}**[in which [either Russia shoots down a
U.S. plane or vice versa]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Even then, I think that
neither Washington nor Moscow would rationally want a conventional
fight. But conflict dynamics are never wholly rational; far from it.
**[[Violence can]{.mark} generate new emotional pressures in conflict
and [spin out of control]{.mark} in a direction nobody
anticipated.]{.underline}** Besides the risk of escalation with Russia,
the more the United States starts directly attacking Shiite militias,
the more likely **[the Iranian nuclear deal will completely break down.
This would reopen the possibility of a U.S. war with
Iran]{.underline}**. Even before that point, **[Iran]{.underline}**
**[would]{.underline}** likely **[react to counter the United States in
the region by exerting much more aggressive influence over
Baghdad]{.underline}**. The nightmare scenario would be **[an Iranian
puppet like ex-Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki getting back into power
and issuing a demand for U.S. forces to leave Iraq, which would put
Washington in a vexed position of either accepting or returning to
direct rule.]{.underline}** To avoid escalations of this sort, the Trump
administration should now lay out a positively defined political vision
for the Middle East, which would accompany and tether its negatively
defined anti-Islamic State and anti-Iranian goals. At this time, the
fundamental part of this vision must be a clear U.S. position on the
future of Kurdish-held areas in Iraq and Syria.

#### That guarantees nuclear escalation

Security at the Primakov National Research Institute of World Economy
and International Relations. "Beyond the Nuclear Threshold: Russia,
NATO, and Nuclear First Use," 10/17.
https://www.europeanleadershipnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Beyond-the-Nuclear-Threshold.pdf

**[It is worthy of note that the latest versions of the Russian Military
Doctrine]{.underline}** of December 2014 **[and the U.S. Nuclear
Posture]{.underline}** of 2010 **[have only two principal
differences]{.underline}**. One is **[that the [U.S. is]{.mark}
apparently [willing to defend]{.mark} its [allies with]{.mark} the use
of [nuclear weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}**, if they are attacked by
overwhelming conventional forces, whereas Russia does not provide such
assurance. The other is that **[[Russia is ready to use nuclear arms if
facing]{.mark} the prospect of [defeat]{.mark} by large-scale
conventional aggression]{.underline}**, while the United States for
obvious reasons does not envision such a contingency. As for
hypothetical NATO-Russia conflict, which at present should be of primary
concern, **[[there are three]{.mark} conceivable [causes of nuclear
first use]{.mark}:]{.underline}** 1. The "**[traditional" scenario of
using tactical nuclear weapons as an escalation from a conventional
conflict to prevent]{.underline}** one's **[imminent
defeat]{.underline}**. 2. **[Nuclear use due to an
accident]{.underline}** or provocation. 3. **[Reaction to attacks by an
enemy's conventional weapons against one's nuclear forces and their C3I
systems]{.underline}** (which may be **[[defined
by]{.underline}]{.mark}** a term
"**[[entanglement]{.underline}]{.mark}**"). In today's world, there are
two trends aggravating the danger of first use. **[One is the tense
standoff between Russian and U.S./NATO armed forces over Ukraine, and in
the Baltic, Black Sea, and Arctic regions, as well as a lack of
cooperation in parallel military operations in Syria]{.underline}**. To
some extent, similar conflict might erupt between China and the U.S. or
its allies in the Western Pacific over Taiwan and disputed islands and
the jurisdiction of territorial seas. The second trend is the
development of new weaponry, C3I systems and operational concepts, which
erode the traditional delineation between nuclear and conventional arms,
between offensive and defensive systems, and between a local conflict
and a regional---or even global---war. Escalation of local conflict One
of the great paradoxes of today is that the level of armed forces
concentrated on both sides of NATO-Russia common border is much lower
than 25 years ago,1 but the risk of armed conflict is much higher. This
is due to several factors. In the absence of mutually recognized
dividing lines, "quasi-frozen" **[[conflicts]{.mark} in Ukraine,
Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Moldova [could suddenly erupt]{.mark} and draw
Poland, the Baltic states, Turkey, and Romania]{.underline}** - together
**[with the rest of NATO - into a military clash with
Russia.]{.underline}** Discarding the fears of its weaker neighbors,
Russia considers NATO expansion to its borders to be inherently unlawful
and threatening. Although the present scale of the alliance deployment
is modest, these forces are considered only a forward echelon of NATO's
altogether superior conventional military power, which may be promptly
redeployed from the rest of Europe and across the Atlantic from the
United States. **[The next war might thus take place much closer to
Russia's heartland than envisioned]{.underline}** 40- 50 years ago,
which makes Moscow's fears and stakes in a potential conflict much
higher. To demonstrate its resolve and toughness Russia is challenging
NATO near its territory, where Russian conventional forces are naturally
superior. Even in peacetime, **[large-scale military exercises of
Russian and NATO armed forces close to each other create a threat of
collisions and accidents between ships and aircraft]{.underline}** with
an **[accompanying risk of escalation]{.underline}**. Such **[a chain
reaction might be hard to stop:]{.underline}** **[the Kremlin is keen to
prove that the weakness of the 1990s will never return, while the White
House is determined to demonstrate that it remains the "toughest guy on
the block".]{.underline}** In the present state of confrontation, a
**[direct military conflict between Russia and NATO in Eastern Europe,
the Baltic or the Black seas would provoke an early use of nuclear
arms]{.underline}** by any side which consider defeat otherwise
unavoidable. This **[[risk is exacerbated by]{.mark} the fact that
tactical nuclear and conventional systems are co-located at the bases of
general purpose forces]{.underline}** and employ dual-purpose launchers
and delivery vehicles of the Navy, Air Force, and ground forces. Should
the Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF)2 collapse, and deployment
of new medium and shorter range missiles in Europe by either or both
sides become a reality, the prospect of early nuclear use and a
consequential prompt escalation of nuclear strikes from theater to
strategic level would be much more probable. The way to deal with the
above-mentioned dangers requires making several moves: The first is to
apply a more concerted effort to peacefully settle Europe's ongoing
conflicts, above all in Ukraine and Moldova. If the Minsk agreements are
not implemented, two years since their conclusion, they should be
supplemented with effective enforcement mechanisms. Secondly, the INF
Treaty must be preserved and mutual accusatiounites of non-compliance
should be addressed and removed through diplomacy. Thirdly, the scale of
military exercises of Russia and NATO should be reduced on a mutual
basis and separated geographically. Confidence-building and transparency
measures (Vienna Document, Open Skies Treaty) should be expanded and the
U.S.-Soviet accident voidance conventions (of 1972 and 1989) should be
enhanced and put on a NATO-Russia footing. Finally, an agreement should
be reached to halt the military buildup on both sides of the
NATO-Russian border at the present level, with the intention to reduce
force deployments in the future. **[[Accidents]{.mark}]{.underline}** As
reliable as negative control systems are (e.g. the prevention of
unauthorized nuclear use), accidents are possible, even between the U.S.
and Russia. A **[frightening example of things going terribly wrong was
provided by the 1995 accident involving the launch of a Norwegian
geodesic]{.underline}** **[rocket]{.underline}**, which was taken for a
Trident 2 missile, **[triggering the Russian early warning
system]{.underline}**. The event was urgently reported to the president,
the "Cheget" system was activated, and Boris Yeltsin, as he said later,
for several minutes held his finger "on the nuclear button" -- until the
incident was settled. But what if the event had been in fact an
unauthorized single launch of Trident-2, or a French SLBM? **[Would it
have started a massive exchange of nuclear strikes and a global
catastrophe?]{.underline}** To complicate the picture further**[, a
growing number of nations will in the near and medium term acquire
[sea-based ballistic]{.mark} and cruise [missiles and hypersonic
boost-glide weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}** with variable trajectories,
**[which would [make accidents]{.mark} or provocations [more
likely]{.mark} and the process of identifying an attacker less
certain.]{.underline}** The avoidance of nuclear war by miscalculation
or provocation should be the top priority for the U.S. and Russia in
spite of the tensions in their relations, or rather precisely because of
such tensions.

## China-Taiwan Scenario

### 1AC \-\-- China-Taiwan Scenario

#### Scenario #\_\_: China

#### China will invade Taiwan now; Ukraine has set the stage and draws in Russia

Enrico **Colombatto 22**, Enrico Colombatto is a professor of economics
at the University of Turin, Italy; he is also director of research at
the Institut de Recherches Economiques et Fiscales (IREF) in Paris,
5/12/22, "Taiwan: Scenarios for an invasion from China," *GIS*,
<https://www.gisreportsonline.com/r/china-taiwan-invasion/>, JH

**[The [Russian invasion of Ukraine]{.mark} has [shown]{.mark} that the
quest for personal prestige]{.underline}**, historical nostalgia and
beliefs in national myths still play a role in shaping international
politics. **[The economy is important, of course, but it is only part of
the story in some cases. Indeed, [Taiwan may be another victim of the
rhetoric of "reunification]{.mark} with the motherland" and Beijing's
need to boost its image with the illusion of an easy gain on the
international stage]{.underline}**. 

Some speculate that Russian President
Vladimir [Putin](https://www.gisreportsonline.com/r/containing-russia/)'s
blunder in Ukraine will make mainland China more cautious. As Ukraine
has taught the Russians, reunification is not always welcome -- spoiling
the aggressor's plans to present the world with a fait accompli before
reactions and countermeasures take force.

**[There are important differences, however, between Ukraine and
Taiwan]{.underline}**. The world has recognized Ukraine as an
independent nation since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, while
**[many nations]{.underline}** **[do not support Taiwan's
independence]{.underline}** and recognize the [People's Republic of
China](https://english.www.gov.cn/) as the sole legal government of
China.

**[One may also argue that [Beijing]{.mark} might be [encouraged to take
advantage of the West's]{.mark} [preoccupation]{.mark} with Eastern
Europe and possibly reluctance to oppose Russia and China
simultaneously.]{.underline}** In this light, of course, **[[ongoing
tensions in Ukraine]{.mark} would [justify]{.mark} a [deal between
Russia and China]{.mark} to allow Russia to circumvent Western sanctions
[and set the stage for China's possible invasion of
Taiwan]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**[The current global situation will soon hit the well-performing
Taiwanese economy]{.underline}**. Thanks to its free-market approach,
Taiwan is a success story. It features an impressive growth record and
low inflation (the government predicts 2 percent in 2022, up from 1.6
percent in 2021). Taiwan is a world player in electronics (microchips),
a significant machinery exporter and a major destination for high-tech
foreign direct investments. 

**[For the Taiwanese, [heightened tensions threaten]{.mark} its [robust
trade with]{.mark} mainland [China]{.mark} and Hong Kong, which absorb
about 50 percent of the island's exports]{.underline}**. A political
crisis will force the Taiwanese to direct more resources to the defense
industry, while future investments by domestic and international actors
will be threatened. **[Growth can suffer. In short, independence is
expensive even without overt aggression. ]{.underline}**

#### That war goes nuclear because Chinese nuclear and conventional forces are intermingled

published Nov/Dec 2018\]

**[As China's power has grown]{.underline}** in recent years,
**[so]{.underline}**, **[too]{.underline}**, **[has the risk of war with
the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates.
**[Under]{.underline}** President **[Xi]{.underline}** Jinping,
**[[China has increased]{.mark} its]{.underline}** political and
economic **[[pressure on Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark}** and built
military installations on coral reefs in the South China Sea, **[fueling
Washington's fears that Chinese expansionism will threaten U.S. allies
and influence]{.underline}** in the region. **[U.S. destroyers have
transited the Taiwan Strait]{.underline}**, **[to loud protests from
Beijing]{.underline}**. American policymakers have wondered aloud
whether they should send an aircraft carrier through the strait as well.
Chinese fighter jets have intercepted U.S. aircraft in the skies above
the South China Sea. **[Meanwhile]{.underline}**, U.S. President Donald
**[Trump has brought]{.underline}** long-simmering **[economic disputes
to a rolling boil]{.underline}**. A war between the two countries
remains unlikely, but **[the prospect of a [military
confrontation]{.mark}]{.underline}**---**[resulting]{.underline}**, for
example, [**[from]{.underline}** **[a Chinese campaign against
Taiwan]{.underline}**]{.mark}---**[no longer
[seems]{.mark}]{.underline}** as **[im[plausible]{.mark}]{.underline}**
as it once did. And **[the odds of such a confrontation going
nuclear]{.underline}** **[are higher]{.underline}** **[than
most]{.underline}** policymakers and analysts **[think]{.underline}**.
Members of China's strategic community tend to dismiss such concerns.
Likewise, U.S. studies of a potential war with China often exclude
nuclear weapons from the analysis entirely, treating them as basically
irrelevant to the course of a conflict. Asked about the issue in 2015,
Dennis Blair, the former commander of U.S. forces in the Indo-Pacific,
estimated the likelihood of a U.S.-Chinese nuclear crisis as "somewhere
between nil and zero." This assurance is misguided. **[If deployed
against China]{.underline}**, the Pentagon's preferred style of
**[conventional warfare would be a]{.underline}** potential **[recipe
for nuclear escalation]{.underline}**. Since the end of the Cold War,
the United States' signature approach to war has been simple: punch deep
into enemy territory in order to rapidly knock out the opponent's key
military assets at minimal cost. But the Pentagon developed this formula
in wars against Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and Serbia, none of which was
a nuclear power. **[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}**, by contrast, not only
**[[has nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark}]{.underline}**; it has also
**[[intermingled]{.underline}]{.mark}** them **[[with its
conventional]{.mark} military [forces]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, **[making
it difficult to attack one without]{.underline}**]{.mark} attacking
**[[the other]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[This means that
a]{.underline}** major U.S. **[military campaign]{.underline}**
**[targeting China's]{.underline}** **[conventional
forces]{.underline}** **[would]{.underline}** likely **[also threaten
its nuclear arsenal]{.underline}**. **[Faced with such a
threat]{.underline}**, Chinese **[leaders could decide to
use]{.underline}** their **[nuclear weapons]{.underline}** while they
were still able to. As U.S. and Chinese **[leaders navigate a
relationship fraught with mutual suspicion]{.underline}**, they must
come to grips with the fact that a **[conventional war could skid into a
nuclear confrontation]{.underline}**. Although this risk is not high in
absolute terms, its **[consequences]{.underline}** for the region and
the world **[would be devastating]{.underline}**. **[As long as the
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[and China continue to
pursue their current]{.underline}** grand **[strategies]{.underline}**,
**[the risk is likely to endure]{.underline}**. This means that leaders
on both sides should dispense with the illusion that they can easily
fight a limited war. They should focus instead on managing or resolving
the political, economic, and military tensions that might lead to a
conflict in the first place. A NEW KIND OF THREAT There are some reasons
for optimism. For one, China has long stood out for its nonaggressive
nuclear doctrine. After its first nuclear test, in 1964, China largely
avoided the Cold War arms race, building a much smaller and simpler
nuclear arsenal than its resources would have allowed. Chinese leaders
have consistently characterized nuclear weapons as useful only for
deterring nuclear aggression and coercion. Historically, this narrow
purpose required only a handful of nuclear weapons that could ensure
Chinese retaliation in the event of an attack. To this day, China
maintains a "no first use" pledge, promising that it will never be the
first to use nuclear weapons. The prospect of a nuclear conflict can
also seem like a relic of the Cold War. Back then, the United States and
its allies lived in fear of a Warsaw Pact offensive rapidly overrunning
Europe. NATO stood ready to use nuclear weapons first to stalemate such
an attack. Both Washington and Moscow also consistently worried that
their nuclear forces could be taken out in a bolt-from-the-blue nuclear
strike by the other side. This mutual fear increased the risk that one
superpower might rush to launch in the erroneous belief that it was
already under attack. Initially, the danger of unauthorized strikes also
loomed large. In the 1950s, lax safety procedures for U.S. nuclear
weapons stationed on NATO soil, as well as minimal civilian oversight of
U.S. military commanders, raised a serious risk that nuclear escalation
could have occurred without explicit orders from the U.S. president. The
good news is that these Cold War worries have little bearing on
U.S.-Chinese relations today. Neither country could rapidly overrun the
other's territory in a conventional war. Neither seems worried about a
nuclear bolt from the blue. And civilian political control of nuclear
weapons is relatively strong in both countries. What remains, in theory,
is the comforting logic of mutual deterrence: in a war between two
nuclear powers, neither side will launch a nuclear strike for fear that
its enemy will respond in kind. The bad news is that
**[one]{.underline}** other **[trigger remains]{.underline}**: **[a
conventional war that threatens China's nuclear arsenal]{.underline}**.
**[[Conventional forces]{.mark} can threaten nuclear forces in ways that
[generate pressures to escalate]{.mark}]{.underline}**---**[especially
when]{.underline}** ever more capable **[U.S.]{.underline}**
conventional **[forces face adversaries with]{.underline}** relatively
small and **[fragile]{.underline}** nuclear **[arsenals]{.underline}**,
**[such as China]{.underline}**. **[[If U.S. operations
endangered]{.underline}]{.mark}** or damaged **[[China's nuc]{.mark}lear
[forces]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, **[Chinese leaders
might]{.underline}**]{.mark} come to **[[think that Washington had aims
beyond]{.mark} winning [the conventional
war]{.mark}]{.underline}**---**[that it might be seeking
to]{.underline}** disable or **[destroy China's nuclear
arsenal]{.underline}** outright, perhaps as a prelude to regime change.
**[In the fog of war]{.underline}**[, **[Beijing
might]{.underline}**]{.mark} reluctantly **[[conclude]{.mark}
that]{.underline}** limited **[[nuc]{.mark}lear
[escalation]{.mark}]{.underline}**---an initial strike small enough that
it could avoid full-scale U.S. retaliation---**[[was]{.mark} a
[viable]{.mark} option]{.underline}** to defend itself. STRAIT SHOOTERS
**[[The most worrisome flash point]{.underline}]{.mark}** for a
U.S.-Chinese war **[[is Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
**[Beijing's]{.underline}** long-term **[objective of reunifying the
island with mainland China is]{.underline}** clearly **[in conflict with
Washington's]{.underline}** longstanding **[desire to maintain the
status quo in the strait]{.underline}**. It is not difficult to imagine
how **[this might lead to war]{.underline}**. For example, **[[China
could decide that the]{.underline}]{.mark}** political or military
**[[window for]{.mark} regaining [control]{.mark}]{.underline}** over
the island **[[was closing and]{.mark} launch an
[attack]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[[using air]{.underline}]{.mark}** and
naval **[[forces to blockade Taiwanese harbors or bombard]{.mark} the
[island]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Although U.S. law does not require
Washington to intervene in such a scenario, the Taiwan Relations Act
states that the United States will "consider any effort to determine the
future of Taiwan by other than peaceful means, including by boycotts or
embargoes, a threat to the peace and security of the Western Pacific
area and of grave concern to the United States." **[Were Washington to
intervene on Taipei's behalf]{.underline}**, **[the world's sole
superpower and its rising competitor would find themselves
in]{.underline}** the first **[great-power war]{.underline}** of the
twenty-first century. **[In the course of such a war]{.underline}**,
**[U.S. conventional military operations would likely
threaten]{.underline}**, disable, or outright eliminate some **[Chinese
nuclear capabilities]{.underline}**---whether doing so was Washington's
stated objective or not. In fact, if the United States engaged in the
style of warfare it has practiced over the last 30 years, **[this
outcome would be all but guaranteed]{.underline}**. Consider submarine
warfare. **[[China could use its]{.underline}]{.mark}** conventionally
armed attack **[[sub]{.mark}marine[s]{.mark} [to blockade Taiwanese
harbors]{.mark}]{.underline}** or bomb the island, **[[or]{.mark} to
[attack]{.mark} [U.S]{.mark}.]{.underline}** and allied
**[[forces]{.mark} in the region]{.underline}**. **[If that
happened]{.underline}**, **[the [U.S.]{.mark} Navy would]{.underline}**
almost certainly **[undertake an [antisubmarine
campaign]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[which would likely threaten
China's]{.underline}** "boomers," the four **[nuclear-armed ballistic
missile submarines]{.underline}** that form its naval nuclear deterrent.
**[China's]{.underline}** conventionally armed and nuclear-armed
**[submarines share the same]{.underline}** shore-based
**[communications system]{.underline}**; **[a U.S. attack]{.underline}**
**[on]{.underline}** these **[transmitters]{.underline}** would thus not
only disrupt the activities of China's attack submarine force but also
**[[cut off its boomers]{.mark} from contact]{.underline}** with
Beijing, **[[leaving Chinese leaders unsure]{.mark} of the fate of their
naval nuclear force]{.underline}**. In addition, nuclear ballistic
missile submarines depend on attack submarines for protection, just as
lumbering bomber aircraft rely on nimble fighter jets. If the United
States started sinking Chinese attack submarines, it would be sinking
the very force that protects China's ballistic missile submarines,
leaving the latter dramatically more vulnerable. Even more dangerous,
**[U.S. forces]{.underline}** hunting Chinese attack submarines **[could
inadvertently sink a Chinese boomer]{.underline}** instead. After all,
at least some Chinese attack submarines might be escorting ballistic
missile submarines, especially in wartime, when China might flush its
boomers from their ports and try to send them within range of the
continental United States. Since correctly identifying targets remains
one of the trickiest challenges of undersea warfare, a U.S. submarine
crew might come within shooting range of a Chinese submarine without
being sure of its type, especially in a crowded, noisy environment like
the Taiwan Strait. Platitudes about caution are easy in peacetime. In
wartime, when Chinese attack submarines might already have launched
deadly strikes, the U.S. crew might decide to shoot first and ask
questions later. **[[Adding to China's sense of
vulnerability]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[the small size of its
nuclear]{.underline}**-**[armed submarine force means that just
two]{.underline}** such **[incidents would eliminate half of
its]{.underline}** **[sea-based deterrent]{.underline}**. Meanwhile, any
Chinese **[boomers that escaped this fate would]{.underline}** likely
**[be cut off from communication]{.underline}** with onshore commanders,
left without an escort force, and unable to return to destroyed ports.
If that happened, **[China would essentially have no naval nuclear
deterrent]{.underline}**. The situation is similar onshore, where any
U.S. military campaign would have to contend with China's growing
land-based conventional ballistic missile force. Much of this force is
within range of Taiwan, ready to launch ballistic missiles against the
island or at any allies coming to its aid. Once again, U.S.
**[victory]{.underline}** would hinge on the ability to degrade this
conventional ballistic missile force. And once again, it **[would be
virtually impossible]{.underline}** to do so **[while leaving China's
nuclear ballistic missile force unscathed]{.underline}**. **[Chinese
conventional and nuclear ballistic missiles are]{.underline}** often
**[attached to the same base headquarters]{.underline}**, meaning that
**[they]{.underline}** likely **[share transportation and supply
networks]{.underline}**, **[patrol routes]{.underline}**, **[and other
supporting infrastructure]{.underline}**. It is also possible that they
share some command-and-control networks, or that the United States would
be unable to distinguish between the conventional and nuclear networks
even if they were physically separate. To add to the challenge, some of
China's ballistic missiles can carry either a conventional or a nuclear
warhead, and the two versions are virtually indistinguishable to U.S.
aerial surveillance. In a war, targeting the conventional variants would
likely mean destroying some nuclear ones in the process. Furthermore,
**[sending manned aircraft to attack Chinese missile launch
sites]{.underline}** and bases **[would require]{.underline}** at least
**[partial control of the airspace over China]{.underline}**,
**[which]{.underline}** in turn **[would require weakening Chinese air
defenses]{.underline}**. But degrading **[China's coastal air defense
network]{.underline}** in order to fight a conventional war
**[would]{.underline}** also **[leave much of its nuclear force without
protection]{.underline}**. Once China was under attack, its leaders
might come to fear that even intercontinental ballistic missiles located
deep in the country's interior were vulnerable. For years, observers
have pointed to the U.S. military's failed attempts to locate and
destroy Iraqi Scud missiles during the 1990--91 Gulf War as evidence
that mobile missiles are virtually impervious to attack. Therefore, the
thinking goes, China could retain a nuclear deterrent no matter what
harm U.S. forces inflicted on its coastal areas. Yet recent research
suggests otherwise. **[Chinese intercontinental ballistic
missiles]{.underline}** are **[larger and less mobile
than]{.underline}** the **[Iraqi Scuds]{.underline}** were, and they are
harder to move without detection. **[The U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[is]{.underline}** also **[likely to have
been tracking them]{.underline}** much more closely in peacetime. As a
result, China is unlikely to view a failed Scud hunt in Iraq nearly 30
years ago as reassurance that its residual nuclear force is safe today,
especially during an ongoing, high-intensity conventional war. China's
vehement criticism of a U.S. regional missile defense system designed to
guard against a potential North Korean attack already reflects these
latent fears. Beijing's worry is that this system could help Washington
block the handful of missiles China might launch in the aftermath of a
U.S. attack on its arsenal. That sort of campaign might seem much more
plausible in Beijing's eyes if a conventional war had already begun to
seriously undermine other parts of China's nuclear deterrent. It does
not help that China's real-time awareness of the state of its forces
would probably be limited, since blinding the adversary is a standard
part of the U.S. military playbook. Put simply, **[the [favored U.S.
strategy]{.mark} to ensure a conventional victory
[would]{.mark}]{.underline}** likely **[[endanger]{.underline}]{.mark}**
much of **[China's [nuclear arsenal]{.mark}]{.underline}** in the
process, at sea and on land. **[Whether the United States actually
intended to target]{.underline}** all of China's nuclear **[weapons
would be incidental]{.underline}**. **[All that would matter is that
Chinese leaders would consider them threatened]{.underline}**. LESSONS
FROM THE PAST At that point, the question becomes, How will China react?
Will it practice restraint and uphold the "no first use" pledge once its
nuclear forces appear to be under attack? Or will it use those weapons
while it still can, gambling that limited escalation will either halt
the U.S. campaign or intimidate Washington into backing down? Chinese
writings and statements remain deliberately ambiguous on this point. It
is unclear which exact set of capabilities China considers part of its
core nuclear deterrent and which it considers less crucial. For example,
if China already recognizes that its sea-based nuclear deterrent is
relatively small and weak, then losing some of its ballistic missile
submarines in a war might not prompt any radical discontinuity in its
calculus. The danger lies in **[[wartime
developments]{.underline}]{.mark}** that **[[could shift China's
assumptions about U.S. intentions]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[If
[Beijing]{.mark} interprets the erosion]{.underline}** of its sea- and
land-based **[nuclear forces as a deliberate effort]{.underline}** to
destroy its nuclear deterrent, or perhaps even as a prelude to a nuclear
attack, **[it [might see]{.mark} limited [nuclear escalation as a way
to]{.mark} force an [end]{.mark} to [the
conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}**. For example, **[[China could use
nuclear weapons to]{.underline}]{.mark}** instantaneously
**[[destroy]{.mark} the [U.S. air bases]{.mark} that posed the biggest
threat to its arsenal]{.underline}**. **[It could also launch a nuclear
strike with no]{.underline}** direct **[military
purpose]{.underline}**---on an unpopulated area or at sea---**[as a way
to signal that the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[had
crossed a redline]{.underline}**. [**[If such escalation appears
far-fetched]{.underline}**, **[China's history suggests
otherwise]{.underline}**]{.mark}. **[In 1969]{.underline}**, **[similar
dynamics]{.underline}** **[brought China to the brink of nuclear war
with the Soviet Union]{.underline}**. In early March of that year,
Chinese troops ambushed Soviet guards amid rising tensions over a
disputed border area. Less than two weeks later, the two countries were
fighting an undeclared border war with heavy artillery and aircraft.
**[The conflict quickly escalated beyond what Chinese
leaders]{.underline}** had **[expected]{.underline}**, **[and before the
end of March]{.underline}**, **[Moscow was making thinly veiled nuclear
threats]{.underline}** to pressure China to back down. Chinese leaders
initially dismissed these warnings, only to radically upgrade their
threat assessment once they learned that the Soviets had privately
discussed nuclear attack plans with other countries. Moscow never
intended to follow through on its nuclear threat, archives would later
reveal, but Chinese leaders believed otherwise. On three separate
occasions, they were convinced that a Soviet nuclear attack was
imminent. Once, when Moscow sent representatives to talks in Beijing,
China suspected that the plane transporting the delegation was in fact
carrying nuclear weapons. **[Increasingly fearful]{.underline}**,
**[China test-fired a thermonuclear weapon]{.underline}** in the Lop Nur
desert **[and put its rudimentary nuclear forces on
alert]{.underline}**---a dangerous step in itself, as it increased the
risk of an unauthorized or accidental launch. Only after numerous
preparations for Soviet nuclear attacks that never came did Beijing
finally agree to negotiations. China is a different country today than
it was in the time of Mao Zedong, but **[the 1969 conflict offers
important lessons]{.underline}**. **[China started a war in which it
believed nuclear weapons would be irrelevant]{.underline}**, even though
the Soviet arsenal was several orders of magnitude larger than China's,
just as the U.S. arsenal dwarfs China's today. **[Once the conventional
war did not go as planned]{.underline}**, **[the Chinese reversed their
assessment of the possibility of a nuclear attack]{.underline}** **[to a
degree bordering on paranoia]{.underline}**. Most worrying, **[China
signaled that it was]{.underline}** actually **[considering using its
nuclear weapons]{.underline}**, **[even though it had to
expect]{.underline}** devastating **[retaliation]{.underline}**.
Ambiguous wartime information and worst-case thinking led it to take
nuclear risks it would have considered unthinkable only months earlier.
This pattern could unfold again today.

#### Mine warfare and unmanned submarines are key to deter Chinese invasion of Taiwan

Minnie **Chan 22**, Minnie Chan is an award-winning journalist,
specialising in reporting on defence and diplomacy in China, 6/28/22,
"US urged to plan minelaying campaign to halt mainland Chinese attack on
Taiwan," *South China Morning Post*,

**[A US navy [commander suggests]{.mark} that [laying mines in]{.mark}
the [Yellow Sea and]{.mark} [Pearl River]{.mark} Delta could
[help]{.mark} [bring Beijing to]{.mark} the [negotiating
table]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

The United States could pursue an aggressive but low-cost strategy of
laying mines in the Yellow Sea and Pearl River Delta to **[force China
to negotiate in the event of conflict between the two
powers]{.underline}**, according to an American naval analyst.

**[He said the [countermeasure]{.mark} could be [seen as a form of
deterrence]{.mark} or economic warfare designed [to prevent
an escalation]{.mark} [if the US decided to
intervene](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3160692/us-has-practised-strategic-ambiguity-taiwan-decades-set-change) [following]{.mark}
a [[mainland Chinese attack on
Taiwan]{.mark}](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/military/article/3182168/beijing-likely-step-its-campaign-reunify-taiwan-analysts-say)]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}

In an article published by the US Naval Institute this month, Commander
Victor Duenow wrote that the country\'s armed forces would be at a
\"significant and immediate disadvantage\" when dealing with the
aggressive and capable [People\'s Liberation
Army](https://www.scmp.com/topics/china-military) as [China had closed
the military capability gap with the
US](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/military/article/3182724/keep-china-pentagon-must-cut-red-tape-and-embrace-latest),
and even gained superiority in several areas.

The article, which won the first prize in naval mine warfare essay
contest sponsored by the Mine Warfare Association, a non-profit aimed at
promoting awareness of the weapons, suggested **[the US Indo-Pacific
Command (IndoPaCom) should \"pursue offensive mining capabilities to use
in the Yellow Sea and Pearl River Delta]{.underline}**\".

Duenow, who has experience of airborne mine countermeasures, said the
PLA Navy (PLAN) was \"limited\" in how it could respond, and had mainly
focused on countering mines in ports and near the shore.

\"**[Finding a way to bring China into diplomatic negotiations on
favorable terms to the United States is the goal, and offensive mine
warfare can help achieve it]{.underline}**,\" he wrote, adding
that mine warfare would also jeopardise China\'s economy by disrupting
trade and oil supplies.

\"The United States can also dispute Chinese sea control while preparing
for a counteroffensive \... By investing in cost-effective mine warfare,
IndoPaCom can deter Chinese aggression and buy time while it builds
high-end warfighting capabilities to better counter China.\"

**[Tensions in the Taiwan Strait have mounted in recent years as
the [PLA has stepped up its military
operations](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/military/article/3180160/chinese-pla-bombers-carry-out-night-raid-drills-around-taiwan)]{.underline}**,
prompting a renewed focus on what the US reaction would be to an attack
on the island.

Beijing considers Taiwan as a renegade province that should be brought
into its fold - by force if necessary.

**[\"Naval [mining is a nasty countermeasure that would put]{.mark} both
[Chinese warships]{.mark} and commercial vessels [at high
risk]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,\"]{.mark} Beijing based naval analyst Li
Jie said, but argued the tactic was more likely to trigger a response
from the PLA than force China to the negotiating table.

\"**[The PLAN will stage a comprehensive minesweeper campaign by
blocking waterways in the region]{.underline}**. If Washington wants to
push Beijing into a corner, it might push the PLA to take tit-for-tat
action by laying naval mines in some waterways used by American
vessels.\"

Macau-based military observer Antony Wong Tong said the US could use
stealth fighter jets to drop homing torpedoes in the Pearl River Delta.

\"The Pearl River Delta area includes inland rivers and has no warships.
Moves to lay mines in that area would actually be targeting civilian
vessels, which will violate international law,\" Wong said.

**[The US [navy]{.mark} is [developing]{.mark} a new type
of [mine warfare]{.mark} that can be [placed covertly on]{.mark} the
[seabed by a robot submarine with sensors]{.mark} to spot a
target]{.underline}** by firing an encapsulated homing torpedo.

Drew Thompson, a visiting senior research fellow at the National
University of Singapore\'s Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, said:
\"If \[mainland\] **[[China]{.mark} decides [to use force against
Taiwan]{.mark}, [there will be intervention, and]{.mark} there will
be [escalation]{.mark}]{.underline}**,\" **[[adding naval mining]{.mark}
could be seen as a form of economic warfare.]{.underline}**

\"Economic warfare is a major tool in China\'s toolkit, as is economic
coercion \[against Taiwanese businesses\], just as the US and UN use
financial sanctions. China denounces other countries\' unilateral
sanctions, even when it practices its own**[. Blockades are an extension
of warfare]{.underline}**.\"

Collin Koh, a research fellow with the S Rajaratnam School of
International Studies at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore,
said: \"Naval mining is ultimately one of the tools used in the lead up
to, and during war.

\"Assuming naval mining is done in the window of tension that precedes
the possible outbreak of conflict, such a known act will of course be
inflammatory and escalatory, **[but it may also [help to cool heads and
compel the other party to reconsider]{.mark} his
[options]{.mark}.\"]{.underline}**

During the Vietnam war, the US conducted a short minelaying campaign
after North Vietnam launched its Easter offensive in March 1972, that
saw thousands being laid in the waters off Haiphong and other ports.

A year later it had to remove them all in a six-month operation agreed
under the Paris Peace Accords.

#### Minelaying could deter China but neither US or Taiwan has the capability

Lt Col Julian **Thomas 22**, Lieutenant Colonel Thomas is a student at

Also, in a China--Taiwan scenario, **[a good counter [A2/AD]{.mark} zone
[strategy]{.mark} would [involve creating a forbidden]{.mark}
[zone]{.mark} within the Strait of Taiwan, exploiting China's
antisubmarine capabilities as a potential vulnerability.]{.underline}**
Since China has weak antisubmarine capabilities, the joint force,
Taiwan, and allies can position submarines as a deterrent force that
could inflict an extremely high cost to China's fleets. **[The [use of
very cheap and effective sea mines]{.mark} [would be a]{.mark} good
[element of any sea denial course]{.mark} of action. However, the [US
Navy lacks even a threadbare capability]{.mark} in this warfare area.
[Taiwan has a modest one]{.mark} [but]{.mark} probably [not
sufficient]{.mark} given the hydrography of the Taiwan
Strait]{.underline}**. **[Mines take some time and effort to
sweep]{.underline}**. If nothing else, this would seriously affect any
time, space, and force consideration of invaders and **[thus make any
mine laying forces an early target in a war]{.underline}**. In addition,
**[Beijing is heavily dependent on seaborne
commerce]{.underline}**.[64](https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/JIPA/Display/Article/3019529/bold-and-unprecedented-moves-building-a-us-taiwan-defense-strategy-in-the-strai/#sdendnote64sym) If
inbound Chinese vessels and aircraft perceive that they cannot safely
navigate through Taiwan's counter A2/AD zone, it would make it extremely
difficult for Beijing to receive goods. Chinese trade traveling through
the counter **[A2/AD zone could be targeted to frustrate and pressure
China economically to change its behavior in the

### 2AC \-\-- Mines Stop Invasion

#### Minelaying allows for negotiations and stops invasion

Meera **Suresh 22**, Senior writer at International Business Times with
a degree in Journalism and lives currently in India, 6/28/22, "US Navy
Commander Floats Alarming Plan On China: Mine Yellow Sea, Pearl River
Delta," *International Business Times*,
https://www.ibtimes.com/us-navy-commander-floats-alarming-plan-china-mine-yellow-sea-pearl-river-delta-3554456

**[The [U.S. can bring Beijing to the negotiation table by
mining]{.mark} the [Yellow Sea]{.mark} and Pearl River Delta in the
event of a conflict between the two superpowers]{.underline}**, a U.S.
Navy commander has noted. Mining these two key waterways would strike
the Chinese economy, he added.

Commander Victor Duenow made these observations in
an [article](https://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/2022/june/disputing-chinese-sea-control-through-offensive-sea-mining) published
by the U.S. Naval Institute this month. **[According to the naval
expert, possible future conflict scenarios between the United States and
an \"increasingly aggressive and capable]{.underline}**\" China will
leave the former at a disadvantage.

**[[Mines are cheap and effective weapons that can help the U.S. buy
time]{.mark} and space for a counterattack in the event of Beijing
launching a conflict through surprise and deception]{.underline}**,
Duenow said. The commander\'s essay reportedly won the first prize in
the naval mine warfare essay contest sponsored by the Mine Warfare
Association. 

\"If the People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) had free use of its naval
facilities during a conflict with the United States, China would be
better able to attain and sustain sea control. **[[Mining Chinese waters
would exploit China's relative weakness in mine countermeasures]{.mark},
challenge and deter PLAN activity]{.underline}**, and disrupt logistics
support for PLAN offensive operations,\" noted Duenow, who is
experienced in airborne mine countermeasures.  

**[Though China has mine countermeasures platforms, its equipment is
outdated, limited and focused on mine countermeasures in the nearshore
and port environments. [This would leave China vulnerable,]{.mark} he
added. ]{.underline}**

**[He added that mining the Pearl River Delta and the Yellow Sea would
[also disrupt China's economy by interrupting the flow of
Chinese]{.mark} trade [goods]{.mark} and oil imports]{.underline}**.
\"Finding a way to bring China into diplomatic negotiations on favorable
terms to the United States is the goal, and offensive mine warfare can
help achieve it. Mines complicate China's military problem, placing PLAN
forces at risk. The United States can also dispute [Chinese sea
control](https://ibtimes.com/habitual-offender-beijing-lashes-out-after-uss-benfold-enters-south-china-sea-3553116) while
preparing for a counteroffensive,\" he added.

However, many think the tactic would infuriate China further. According
to Beijing-based naval analyst Li Jie, mining the waterway will trigger
a response from the PLA than force China to the negotiating table.

\"The PLAN will stage a comprehensive minesweeper campaign by blocking
waterways in the region. If Washington wants to push Beijing into a
corner, it might push the PLA to take tit-for-tat action by laying naval
mines in some waterways used by American vessels,\" Li told [South China

Collin Koh, a research fellow with the S Rajaratnam School of
International Studies at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore,
also thinks the act will be escalatory. \"**[Assuming naval mining is

#### UUVs uniquely allow minelaying campaigns in the SCS and Taiwan Strait

assistant Lecturer and PhD Student at People\'s Friendship University of
Russia, 1/12/22, "Underwater drones herald sea change in Pacific
warfare," *Asia times,*

JH

**[The [drones]{.mark} that have changed the complexion of war from the
sky are being [replicated at sea,]{.mark} as great powers develop and
[deploy]{.mark} unmanned underwater vessels ([UUVs]{.mark}) to gain a
strategic edge in the Pacific and beyond.]{.underline}**

**[The United States, United Kingdom, China and Russia are all
developing and deploying the vessels]{.underline}**, indicating the
"**[dronification" of future maritime warfare]{.underline}**.

**[The UK, which is expanding its military presence in the Pacific, is
set to operate its [first extra-large underwater
drone](https://ukdefencejournal.org.uk/royal-navy-looking-for-extra-large-drone-submarine/)]{.underline}** to
complement its Astute-class submarines. The Royal Navy's efforts to
design, build, and test such a drone have been designated Project CETUS,
and aim to produce a 27-tonne, 12-meter Autonomous Underwater Vehicle
(AUV) demonstrator.

The contract for Project CETUS is projected to be finalized in financial
year 2021-2022, with a projected cost of 21.5 million pounds (US\$29.3
million.)

The Royal Navy is also working on the [Manta underwater
drone](https://www.navylookout.com/manta-the-royal-navy-gets-its-first-extra-large-autonomous-submarine/),
an unmanned version of the existing S201 manned submersible made by
MSubs, a British manufacturer.

The US is working on the similar [Orca Extra Large Unmanned Undersea
Vehicle
(XLUUV)](https://news.lockheedmartin.com/2017-10-30-Lockheed-Martin-to-Design-U-S-Navys-Extra-Large-Unmanned-Undersea-Vehicle-XLUUV-Orca),
as the US Navy awarded Boeing contracts worth a total of \$274.4 million
to produce five Orca XLUUVs in 2019.

The Orca can be used for mine countermeasures, anti-submarine warfare,
anti-surface warfare, electronic warfare and strike missions without
risking the lives of its operators.

**[[China]{.mark} is also [known to be using underwater drones,
with]{.mark} [[Indonesia]{.mark} seizing three Chinese
drones](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/military/article/3117076/chinas-underwater-drones-seized-indonesia-expose-tech-routes) labeled

drones in the Indian Ocean to gather oceanographic data to support
submarine operations. Island in December 2020.

Moreover, China operates the [HSU-001 underwater
drone](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/41478/china-tested-an-ai-controlled-submarine-hunting-underwater-drone-a-decade-ago-report),
which is roughly analogous to the Project CETUS, Manta, and Orca drones.
The HSU-001 was reportedly tested off Fujian or the Taiwan Strait,
simulating anti-submarine operations. 

**[The [proliferation of underwater drones in the Pacific region]{.mark}
is [changing]{.mark} the complexion of [underwater
warfare]{.mark}]{.underline}**, as the region's maritime environment
poses unique operational challenges to underwater operations.

The contested South China Sea is a semi-enclosed body of water with
numerous unmapped underwater features and shallows, which makes
navigation hazardous for both crewed surface and underwater combatants.

**[At the same time, the South China Sea provides an ideal operating
environment for shallow-water conventional submarines, as the area's
underwater features and high shipping traffic enables such vessels to
stay undetected for prolonged periods]{.underline}** by using
environmental factors to mask their signatures.

**[By extension, the [S]{.mark}outh [C]{.mark}hina [S]{.mark}ea [is an
ideal proving ground for underwater drones]{.mark}]{.underline}**, as
they can perform underwater tasks that may be too dull, demanding,
dangerous or even dirty for humans.

Underwater drones can be used for bathymetric mapping, alongside
recording the thermal, magnetic, and acoustic properties of specific
underwater passages to find blind spots where submarines can travel
undetected safely.

**[As such, this capability is particularly suited for use in the South
China Sea, which is among the most challenging bodies of water for
submarine navigation]{.underline}** due to its shallow waters, numerous
underwater peaks and sandbars.

**[The [[recent collision]{.mark} [of]{.mark} the USS

with]{.mark} an [unmapped]{.mark} [seamount]{.mark} in the South China
Sea [illustrates the danger]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In addition, these
drones can also find submarine hiding spots to serve as staging areas
for underwater operations, or sanctuaries to avoid enemy anti-submarine
warfare operations.

**[They can [also]{.mark} potentially be [used for mine-hunting and
minelaying operations]{.mark}. Underwater drones can scout underwater
minefields and possibly disarm naval mines. They may [reduce the need
for specialized diver teams]{.mark} to reconnoiter, identify, and demine
potential landing beaches for amphibious warfare
operations.]{.underline}**

**[The drones can also perform anti-submarine operations by actively
searching and tracking enemy submarines]{.underline}**, without
endangering manned surface vessels or submarines. The [1971 sinking of
the Indian frigate INS
Kukri](http://www.indiandefencereview.com/interviews/1971-war-sinking-of-the-khukri/) by
the Pakistani submarine PNS Hangor illustrates the possibility of
anti-submarine warships becoming easy prey for enemy submarines.

**[The use of underwater drones for anti-submarine purposes will thus
minimize the need to commit manned warships for such
operations.]{.underline}**

**[More significantly, [underwater drones can become strategic]{.mark}
weapons [when loaded with nuclear weapons]{.mark}. Such nuclear-armed
underwater drones can bypass enemy missile defenses by traveling
underwater, slipping near or into major coastal cities, ports and naval
bases for attack purposes.]{.underline}**

**[One such weapon is Russia's [Poseidon
drone](https://www.thedefensepost.com/2021/01/20/russia-base-underwater-drones/),
which gives Russia a credible second-strike capability in the event of a
nuclear attack.]{.underline}**

the well- known, well-established, and well-connected Chinese and
American respondents were asked a number of questions, including "What
US interests are at stake in the Taiwan Strait such that the United
States would risk war with China over Taiwan?" (Table 1) and "What are
the reasons China wants Taiwan back badly enough to risk war with the
US?" (Table 2) In each case, it was made clear to the interviewees that
the question was in reference to the perceptions and considerations of
Chinese and American decision-making elites and the time of the
1995--1996 crisis. In giving their responses, respondents were asked to
rank them in importance, giving greater weight to the reasons that they
thought carried greater importance in the decision-making process. For
example, if there were two reasons of equal importance, they might rate
them each at 50%; if there were three reasons, a policy was pursued or
three interests that were at stake, the first might be 60% of the
reason, the second 30% and the third 10% and so on, always adding up to
100% so as to facilitate quantifying the results.11 Table 1 indicates
the results of the interviews on the question regarding American
interests in the Taiwan Strait in 1995--1996. Both **[the]{.underline}**
American and Chinese **[respondents saw American
interests]{.underline}** in the Strait at the time **[as consistent with
a security-centric focus]{.underline}**. American respondents'
emphasized strategic interests (46.5% of respondent emphasis) and
economic interests in the region (4.6%) as motivations for US policy in
the Strait in 1995--1996. Another factor that was important here,
however, was domestic politics (19%) and in this case the influence of
the Taiwan lobby. President Clinton was under heavy pressure from
Congress to grant Lee Teng-hui a visa in 1995, and there is no doubt
this was a primary reason he did so. Again, the visa and the Lee visit
were the matters that got the whole crisis rolling. Also important were
the facts that Taiwan was a democracy (and the United States supports
democracy) and that Taiwan was a friend (and the United States supports
its friends).12 As it regards Chinese interests in Taiwan, however, the
story was a bit different in terms of the type of factors driving
policy. Table 2 above indicates that **[the most important interest for
the Chinese decision-making elite]{.underline}** concerning Taiwan,
according to both the American and Chinese respondents, **[was to
uphold]{.underline}** what is here called **[China's "sacred
commitments" to Taiwan by blocking anything or anyone who would take it
away from China]{.underline}**. In other words, **["[sacred
commitments]{.mark}" [are the single most important reason China wanted
Taiwan back enough to risk war with the U]{.mark}]{.underline}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates in 1995--1996 according to both
Chinese and American respondents. What are "sacred commitments"?
**[Sacred commitments are]{.underline}** defined here as a basket of
**[emotional, nationalistic, historical and almost spiritual notions
held by many in China about]{.underline}** the "sacredness" of
**[territorial integrity and the commitment of the
founders]{.underline}** and revolutionaries of modern China **[to the
reunification of the motherland, including Taiwan]{.underline}**.
"Sacred commitments" accurately describes and reflects the content of
numerous Chinese government and scholarly statements on the "sacred"
character of Taiwan and the "mission" of bringing Taiwan back to the
Mainland. "**[Sacred commitments]{.underline}**" **[is a
label]{.underline}** I have **[given to]{.underline}** the following
sorts of notions which were found in the secondary literature,
statements of policy elites, and in the words of the interviewees: 1. a
heartfelt desire to engender a **[sense of dignity]{.underline}** among
the Chinese people **[as they seek to finally end]{.underline}** (in
part by regaining Taiwan) the period of **[foreign oppression and
domination]{.underline}** they endured **[after 1839]{.underline}**,13
along with a sense of the restoration of national "face" ("mianzi" or )
that the return of Taiwan would bring 2. a historical view of the need
for China to be unified to be great (and the sense of perception of
national greatness China would then achieve with reunification) 3. a
commitment to China's forefathers to complete the revolution started in
1911 and continued in 1949 (and Taiwan represents unfinished business in
this regard)14 4. a Chinese sense of identity that Taiwan is simply an
important part of China, and the unique place accorded Taiwan in China's
discourse on unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity in the last 60
years.15 **[Based on the research]{.underline}** presented here,
**[sacred [commitments, not unlike]{.mark} the commitments of [religious
practitioners]{.mark}, are commitments that [go beyond the
pragmatic]{.mark} or [utilitarian]{.mark} ([and]{.mark} thus
[material]{.mark}), but are kept because of]{.underline}** vows made,
beliefs held, and **[emotions deeply felt]{.underline}**. "**[Sacred
commitments]{.underline}**" **[have a life of their own in the
mind]{.underline}** and the heart, can be powerful motivators, **[and
are "a-rational"]{.underline}** in nature, in other words not
necessarily "rational" in the utilitarian sense, and yet not at all
"irrational" from the perspective of those who hold them. The term
"sacred commitments" was derived from the Chinese word for "sacred,"
"shen sheng de," which can be translated as "sacred," "divine," or
"holy," and is found in many places in the official Chinese lexicon and
scattered throughout other Chinese writings---official, scholarly and
popular---in reference to Taiwan.16 **[Upon close analysis of official
government statements on Taiwan]{.underline}** and reunification (before
and after the 1995--1996 crisis), the term **["sacred" is]{.underline}**
found **[paired]{.underline}** together **[with]{.underline}** other
terms like **["mission," "task,' and "duty" in the context of getting
Taiwan back]{.underline}**, and in descriptions of Taiwan itself Taiwan
was sometimes referred to as China's "sacred territory." Because
"sacred" was paired with various other words in the interviews,
secondary literature and in official statements, the term "sacred
commitments" was coined to encompass all of the meanings associated with
"sacred" in China's discourse about Taiwan and reunification. In other
words, because Taiwan has been viewed as China's "sacred territory," and
the idea that getting it back is the Chinese people's "sacred mission,"
"sacred task," or "sacred duty," Mainland Chinese have a commitment to
reunification that is itself "sacred." This is the logic behind the
term, "sacred commitments." **[[Sacred commitments should be
distinguished from]{.underline}]{.mark}** Beijing's more fundamental and
more general national interests, as well as from what Beijing calls its
"**[[core interests]{.underline}]{.mark}**," though certainly getting
Taiwan back constitutes both a national interest and a core interest.
China has many national interests, **[[including development,
security]{.mark}, clean air]{.underline}** to breath and water to drink
for its people, access to sufficient supplies of **[fossil fuels, and
the like]{.underline}**. The Chinese government does not have "sacred
commitments" to each of these, as sacred commitments is defined here,
however. Nor does "Taiwan as core interest" capture what is entailed in
"sacred commitments." **[China has a number of core interests, including
[Tibet, Xinjiang]{.mark}]{.underline}**, Taiwan, **[[the
S]{.underline}]{.mark}**outh **[C]{.underline}**hina
**[S]{.underline}**ea **[[and]{.mark} the [E]{.mark}]{.underline}**ast
**[[C]{.underline}]{.mark}**hina **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**ea,17 but
**[while all are important to Beijing]{.underline}**, and the violation
of any of these are arguably casus belli, **[it can[not]{.mark} be said
that all are [comparable to]{.mark}]{.underline}** the "sacred
commitments" that Beijing has to reunification with
**[[Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark}**.18 Zheng Wang argues that since the
1989 Tiananmen incident and the end of the Cold War, the CCP's
overriding raison d'etre has been redefined from class struggle and
communist revolution, to national liberation and rejuvenation following
imperialist-driven national humiliation (Wang:101-- 129). In this
context, he argues, "**[[Taiwan is fundamental
because]{.underline}]{.mark}** after Hong Kong and Macau's return19
**[[it is the single remaining inhabited Chinese territory not yet
returned to the motherland]{.underline}]{.mark}**" (131). What is here
called "sacred commitments," this basket of issues, was easily the most
common response of both Chinese and American interviewees, and the one
interviewee gave the most weight to in responding to the question about
China's interests in getting Taiwan back. 49.4% of the Chinese
interviewees' emphasis was placed on what is here called sacred
commitments. In fact, "of the 28 Chinese respondents interviewed, only
four failed to refer to some aspect of what has here been called 'sacred
commitments.'" Typical of Chinese responses, Tsinghua University's Chu
Shulong emphasized that **[the conceptual, historical idea that China
should be united]{.underline}**---what the Chinese call "da yi
tong"---**[was the primary force behind China's interest in
Taiwan]{.underline}**.20 Another interviewee, a senior member of China's
research and intelligence community, argued that
**[reunification]{.underline}** with Taiwan **[is China's "historical
task"]{.underline}** and that this was the bulk of the impetus behind
the drive for reunification. A researcher/diplomat at a Chinese Foreign
Ministry think tank said China's interest in Taiwan was not economic
because China had so much Taiwanese investment already, nor was it
strategic, but rather it was about "dignity," "completion of national
unity," and historical Chinese notions regarding the importance of a
unified China ("da yi tong" again). A scholar at one of China's best
universities said she believed getting Taiwan back was primarily (65% of
her emphasis) about "national dignity." Another well-known scholar in
Beijing said he believed that while **[the government did fear the
"domino effect" of letting Taiwan go as it regarded other regions of
China]{.underline}** (Tibet, Xinjiang, etc.), **[as well as the
legitimacy crisis that Chinese leaders]{.underline}** allowing Taiwan to
go **[would face]{.underline}** (together 40% of his emphasis), **[the
most fundamental issues included fear of losing "national
face"]{.underline}** (mianzi), Taiwan's "symbolic importance" or the
issue of "national pride," and again the historical notion of the
importance of a unified China. He added another factor as well that the
last 50 years have created an incremental structure of relations between
the PRC and Taiwan that has made it difficult to break out of,21 a
social structural factor. A researcher at another of China's government
think tanks said unifying the Chinese people/ race ("tongyi Zhonghua
minzu") was the most important issue as it regarded China's interest in
Taiwan. Another interesting dimension of the "sacred commitments" issue
and Taiwan is that two of the interviewees said **[the [Taiwan]{.mark}
issue [is more emotional for the average Chinese people than]{.mark} for
the]{.underline}** more pragmatic **[government [officials]{.mark}, that
for the average Chinese the key issue is the historical, emotional,
passionate appeal of]{.underline}** what is here called "**[sacred
commitments]{.underline}**." One after another of China's international
relations and America experts described what is here called "sacred
commitments" as the, or at least a, primary reason the Mainland Chinese
were/are so passionate about Taiwan. Moving on to other factors given by
interviewees, **[the second most common answer]{.underline}** among the
Chinese **[was domestic political concerns]{.underline}** (21.2%). More
specifically, the interviewees argued that **[leaders feared that any
policy that led to [letting Taiwan go would anger the people, leading to
a loss of political legitimacy]{.mark} which would possibly lead them
[to]{.mark}]{.underline}** lose power and possibly even **[[be
deposed]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The people of China are truly passionate
about Taiwan and a number of the interviewees maintained that the
leaders really fear the backlash that would come from military leaders
and the Chinese "laobaixing"22 if they were to be in power at the time
Taiwan were allowed to successfully secede.23 The third most common
response was strategic/security interests (10.1%), or the fear that
Taiwan would be subsumed into the American orbit and be used by the
Americans as an "unsinkable aircraft carrier" against China, threatening
Chinese security interests. Fourth was the fear that losing Taiwan would
have negative ramifications for territorial integrity above and beyond
the loss of Taiwan itself (7.3%). The argument here was that Tibetans,
Uighurs, Mongolians, and other non-Han separatist groups in China would
say, "If the Taiwanese can declare independence, why can't we?"24 While
they didn't give this one a lot of emphasis in percentages, many of the
Chinese interviewees raised this point (seven of 28 explicitly mentioned
it). It was not something that appeared in official statements, however,
most likely because it would have been too sensitive to express
publically. Moving now from the interviews to statements of policy
elites (which form the second leg of this tripartite methodology), in
the speeches of Chinese officials, there is much to support the notion
that sacred commitments are the key to understanding China's desire to
get Taiwan back in 1995--1996 as well.25 For example, on March 8, 1996,
Central Military Commission vice chair and defense minister Chi Haotian
quoted People's Liberation Army founding father Zhu De, saying, "As long
as Taiwan is not liberated, the Chinese people's historical humiliation
is not washed away; as long as the motherland is not reunited, our
people's armed forces' responsibility is not fulfilled."26 Deng Xiaoping
himself said, "It is the common wish of the Chinese people to reunify
our country. Once the country is unified, all the Chinese people cannot
only stand tall, but also soar" (Bai 1995:23). President Jiang Zemin put
it this way. "To put an end to the separation between the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait and achieve the reunification of the motherland is the
strong aspiration and unshakable determination of all the Chinese
people, including our Taiwan compatriots. It is also an irresistible
historical trend" (Jiang 1995:8). Yet more interesting are a number of
other statements that specifically ascribe a "sacred" character to the
return of Taiwan. In a March 21, 1996, press release commenting on
United States House Resolution 148, which explicitly urged the Clinton
administration to support Taiwan militarily in the event of a Chinese
attack,27 an official Chinese government statement was made, that "the
Chinese government and the people express our resolute opposition to and
strong indignation at this detestable act of the US side which
constitutes a serious encroachment upon China's sovereignty and a gross
interference in China's internal affairs\... Taiwan is China's sacred
territory" (PRC Press Release 1996:49). In a letter to the UN Secretary
General in 1998 regarding Taiwanese accession to the UN, Chinese
Permanent Representative to the UN Qin Huasun wrote, "The settlement of
the question of Taiwan and the reunification of the motherland are the
sacred missions of all the Chinese people, including those in Taiwan"
(BBC and Xinhua News Agency). In March 2000, then-Premier Zhu Rongji
called the resolution of "the Taiwan question" and "the complete
reunification of the motherland" a "sacred mission" (MacIntyre and
August). Hong Kong Chinese correspondent Willy Wo-Lap Lam quoted a
senior PLA officer as arguing for a tough stand on Taiwan after Chen
Shui-bian's August 2002 statements by saying, "If we don't do anything,
we may forever fail in the holy task of liberating the island" (Lam).
Here it's about a "holy task."28 This recitation of the **[statements of
Chinese leaders]{.underline}** and scholars,
**[particularly]{.underline}** when taken **[alongside]{.underline}**
the answers provided by **[the respondents]{.underline}** (who were free
to say what they really thought),29 **[is indicative of the notion
that]{.underline}** statement, such as "Taiwan is China's **[sacred
territory]{.underline}**," **[is clearly an ideational, emotional, even
"religious" commitment]{.underline}** that is widely held to in China,
not just a government slogan. **[Such a "sacred" commitment is not
rooted in the material]{.underline}**. While anyone familiar with
official Chinese government statements can become cynical about them,
the use of this particular language and the fact that it is repeated so
often in conversation with persons who have no personal political
interest in repeating "the party line," underline the notion that these
"sacred commitments" are very real,30 and they clearly play a role in
how the Chinese view/handle Taiwan. There is support in the secondary
literature as well for these arguments that China's commitment to Taiwan
is not based primarily on material security considerations, but on an
ideational fixation on Taiwan and reunification. In his excellent study
of the role of Taiwan in China's historical nationalism, Christopher
Hughes argues that the cession of Taiwan to Japan in 1895 following
China's loss to Japan in the Sino-Japanese War of that year, was "one of
the sparks that set off the prairie fire of Chinese nationalism,"31
underlining again that for Mainland Chinese thinkers, Taiwan's loss has
an outsize importance in the Chinese nationalist narrative. American
China specialist John Garver emphasizes the connections between what
have been called here "sacred commitments" and China's domestic politics
in understanding the crisis. Garver argues that in the wake of the
failures of CCP policies from the Great Leap Forward (1958) to the
Cultural Revolution (1966--1976) to the Tiananmen Incident (1989),
during the 1990s, the Party was relying on nationalism as a rallying
point to sustain its legitimacy, and this made the Taiwan problem much
more sensitive (Garver 1997:47--49). Seemingly treating China's
commitment to Taiwan as a given, a matter with a historical force of its
own, Garver maintains that **[[as Chinese]{.mark} domestic [politics
shifted to nationalism]{.mark} as a basis for]{.underline}** political
**[legitimacy, the [Taiwan]{.mark} issue [became the litmus test for the
younger]{.mark}, more moderate [leaders]{.mark}]{.underline}**, the way
in which they had to show the older, revolutionary leaders that they
remained men and women of mettle. **[[There could be no
compromise]{.mark} on Taiwan]{.underline}**. Added to this was the
succession crisis with Deng Xiaoping's failing health in 1994 and
thereafter (he died in 1997)---the new technocratic leadership lacked
the revolutionary credentials of their elders and yet needed the elders'
support to rule, so **[they had little room for compromise on the Taiwan
issue]{.underline}** given its sensitivities (50).32 In his description
of the central importance of Taiwan to Sino-American relations,
Principal Deputy Director of the US State Department's Policy Planning
Staff during the time of the crisis, Alan Romberg, says of the island,
"For Beijing it symbolized sovereignty, occupying a place at the very
core of China's own sense of national identity and dignity. It stood as
an issue of principle that permitted no compromise." (Romberg 2003:217)
Continuing in the vein of the statements above on Taiwan's value,
well-known Chinese scholar Su Ge has said, "\... \[F\]rom ancient times
Taiwan has been a sacred (shensheng de in the original Chinese) and
indivisible part of China's territory, and this is a fact of history
that no one can change" (Su 1999:6; translation by the author). Hao
Yufan, with an argument consistent with this study as well, says the
Taiwan issue is "an internal problem," a problem that exists "\... due
to the interference of foreign powers and an unfinished civil war" (Hao
2001:183). He adds "\... \[Taiwan\] is a symbol of the invasions and
bullying China has suffered by the foreign powers\...
**[no]{.underline}** \[Mainland **[Chinese]{.underline}**\] **[leader
can exhibit any weakness on]{.underline}** the **[Taiwan]{.underline}**
issue" (183). Sourcing "Sacred" Where have these "sacred commitments"
come from? What is it about Taiwan that evokes such deep feelings among
Mainland Chinese? Does "identity" have something to say about this?
Chinese identity is usually rooted in conceptions of the Yellow River
region and the civilization that grew up there over the past five
thousand years, focusing in particular on the dynastic system of a
unified China that began under Emperor Qin some two thousand-plus years
ago. A concept with primarily ideational and social derivations,
identity in China's case can certainly be related in part as well to the
physical, material geography of the Asian landmass on which the Chinese
people live. As it regards this case study, it is important to note that
**[[Chinese identity on the Mainland has been constructed to include
Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In fact, **[it is not possible for most
Mainland Chinese to conceive of China without Taiwan]{.underline}**, so
successful has been the production of this view of Chinese identity in
Mainland China.33 There are several ways in which today's Mainland
Chinese identity is closely tied to Taiwan and by which **[Taiwanese
independence movements and US policy sometimes threatens
it.]{.underline}** To substantiate this point, a bit of history must be
recalled. Again, the Mainland Chinese notion that "a strong China is a
united China" is hundreds of years old, though the notion is very much
alive today in China and many of the Chinese interviewees mentioned it
in interviews for this study. When the ruling Chinese dynasty was
strong, China was unified and could in most cases thwart threats to
China's sovereignty. When China's ruling dynasty became weak, order
would break down, the country would sometimes break apart, and "foreign
devils" would take advantage of China's weakness, dividing it further.
The latter scenario characterized China's situation in the nineteenth
century when the Qing Dynasty floundered and foreign powers began
encroaching on China's dignity and its territory. **[Since
1839]{.underline}** in particular, **[China has suffered much at the
hands of foreign powers]{.underline}**, starting with the Opium Wars
that began at that time, and **[continuing with the loss of
Taiwan]{.underline}** to Japan in 1895, and on through the 1930s and
1940s with the Japanese invasion of Mainland China and the Chinese Civil
War. Out of this have come notions of China's "century of humiliation"
(approximately 1839--1949). **[This [history and]{.mark} the
[strong]{.mark} sense of [indignation]{.mark}]{.underline}** it has
engendered in the Chinese people, **[which is boldly
[propagated]{.mark}]{.underline}** today **[[by]{.mark}
China's]{.underline}** government **[[media and education]{.mark}al
system, [is a powerful part]{.mark} of]{.underline}** today's Mainland
Chinese **[identity]{.underline}**. It has led to what Gries (2001) has
called "the victimization narrative," a narrative or discourse in China
about China's suffering at foreign hands since 1839, which has also
become a fundamental part of Chinese identity today in the PRC. This, as
Zheng Wang argues, is the key element of China's constructed identity
today, for "**[historical memory is the prime raw material for
constructing China's national identity]{.underline}**," (Wang:223) and
this victimization narrative (or as Wang puts it, this narrative of
national humiliation) is the key element the Party has inculcated in the
people since 1992 to shore up support and its own legitimacy.34 This
narrative of Chinese **[identity]{.underline}** in today's PRC is the
soil in which **[grows]{.underline}** what has here been called
"**[sacred commitments]{.underline}**" to Taiwan---**[[the emotionalism,
nationalism, and indignation at]{.mark} the roles of [foreign
powers]{.mark}]{.underline}** in (i) **[[wresting Taiwan away from
China]{.underline}]{.mark}**,35 and (ii) in keeping Taiwan away from
China.36 The Taiwan question is close to the heart of the deepest lore
of the Chinese Communist Party's rise to power and its epic battles with
the Japanese, then the KMT, and then the KMT's flight to Taiwan, where
the Americans protected them from what Mainlanders saw as their just
desserts. For all of these reasons, from the Mainland Chinese
perspective, **[[to allow Taiwan to leave]{.mark} China]{.underline}**,
whether **[by]{.underline}** plebiscite or by **[foreign incursion,
[is]{.mark} tantamount to [treason,]{.mark} an assault on "Chinese
identity]{.underline}**" as it is presented here, **[and]{.underline}**,
if Zheng Wang is right, is **[[a threat to the]{.mark} core identity and
fundamental legitimacy of the]{.underline}** Chinese Communist
**[[Party]{.underline}]{.mark}** today. A China that is not strong
enough to stop its territory from being carved up (as was the case in
1895, and as the departure of Taiwan would indicate to them today) could
not be the China that Mainland Chinese see gloriously rising from the
ashes of the Western incursions and Japanese invasions of China, the
Chinese civil war and the Cultural Revolution. In Mainland Chinese eyes
this rise started under the bold but often flawed leadership of Mao
Zedong, but has continued under the pragmatic oversight of Deng, Jiang,
Hu and now Xi, as China's booming economy continues to strengthen the
country and enrich the people. A Taiwan that successfully secedes
creates in effect cognitive dissonance as it regards Mainland Chinese
identity, for this would be a serious disconnect between the "what is"
(in this case) and the "what should be." Moreover, allowing Taiwan to go
is also seen as an insult to China's dignity given all that has happened
to China at foreign hands. A very important point here is that
reunification is seen as a way to finally put right what first Japan,
then the KMT/Nationalists, and then the United States have perpetuated
in Mainland eyes in engineering and then maintaining the separation of
Taiwan from China. Letting Taiwan go is also seen as a betrayal by
today's Chinese of their ancestors who pledged to get Taiwan back, a
powerful point in a society in which Confucianism (and its respect for
elders) has been an important part of its historical identity. China's
"sacred commitments" to regaining Taiwan strike very close to the heart
of the Mainland Chinese identity as currently conceived. Addressing
Counter-Arguments As it regards this study's conclusions, how would one
know whether they were wrong? Realists like John Mearsheimer argue that
non-material factors like "sacred commitments" do not drive major policy
decisions, but rather material factors do.37 To test this approach
against the one offered in this study, one might ask what this case
would have looked like had such material factors and interests been the
driving forces? **[One employing a [material-driven Realist
approach]{.mark}]{.underline}**[38]{.mark} **[to China's interest in
Taiwan]{.underline}** and the 1995--1996 crisis **[[might have
expected]{.underline}]{.mark}** to have observed several things. First,
one would have expected **[the Chinese to consider Taiwan's importance
primarily in terms of economic]{.underline}**/resource
**[benefits]{.underline}** that might accrue by regaining the island
**[or]{.underline}** by its **[[strategic value]{.underline}]{.mark}**
as the "unsinkable aircraft carrier." Second, the difference in status
between Taiwan's **[[actual independence]{.mark} and its present
status]{.underline}** (that is, as independent in every way except for
formal, declaratory independence and the international recognition that
would accompany it) **[would [not]{.mark} have been]{.underline}**
expected to have been all that **[[important]{.underline}]{.mark}** to
Beijing. In strictly strategic terms, there is no difference between the
two statuses of Taiwan---in reality it is administratively separate from
China in either case, with its own government, its own currency, its own
military. Third, China must be expected to have looked at its security
as its primary interest, so the matter of Taiwan can be taken in no
other context. Therefore, in line with Realists assumptions, its
identity and/or emotionalism connected to unresolved conflicts from the
past would not be expected to trump the deeper issue of national
security. Given that a war to regain Taiwan could put China in a
position of being at war with the United States, the nation that poses
the most serious potential security threat to China, the nation most in
a position to thwart China's rise as a great power, and (ironically) the
foreign nation singly most responsible for helping facilitate the
astronomical growth of China's export-led economy (by its own foreign
policy in the 1970s and its open trade policies since), **[one would
expect China to take a long view of its economic and security interests
and do everything it could to avoid war with the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates over the symbolism involved in Taiwan's status,
at least until China's power matures. How do these three assumptions
inherent to a Realist, material-driven approach compare to the results
of this study? First, while there certainly is a strategic value to
Taiwan that could benefit Mainland China, it was not the issue this
research found to be the driving force for China's interest in Taiwan
under the period of study. Rather, **["[sacred commitments" were]{.mark}
found to be [most salient]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Moreover, the argument
that China's primary interest in Taiwan is strategic has been made by
some, but is found wanting here. For example, Alan Wachman has argued
that China's primary interest in Taiwan is strategic, most importantly
so that China's navy has a break-out capability, enabling its ships and
in particular its submarines39 greater freedom to move eastward from
Taiwan into deeper water with greater ease and less detectability by the
United States and its security partners. The argument is that presently
China is blocked in to some degree, from Japan's main islands to the
Ryukyus, to Taiwan, to the Philippines, and around to Singapore and the
Malacca Straits. Taiwan would give China naval projection power, hence
its value.40 Wachman's argument has a number of problems as presented.
William Murray, retired submariner, expert on China's maritime policy,
and associate professor at the US Naval War College, says he does not
agree with Wachman that China's possession of Taiwan would give its navy
(its submarines in particular) a break-out capacity, allowing its ships
and subs greater ease and less detectability to move out of the
first-string of islands surrounding China's coast: "I don't really think
China's submarines would have much of a problem getting to deep water
undetected in wartime, as is, so I don't really agree with Dr. Wachman's
premise."41 Wachman's argument has another problem. In his case for the
importance of the geo-strategic factors from the Chinese point of view,
he presents primarily the PLA perspective. Almost all of sources and
quotes he presents are from the PLA.42 It is no surprise that these
thinkers would emphasize the geo-strategic salience of getting Taiwan
back. The data I have presented here, while it includes the PLA point of
view, is not limited there to. In his arguments, Wachman makes great
concessions to what I have called "sacred commitments" and the role of
domestic political pressures on the leadership,43 though in the end he
dismisses their importance in favor of geo-strategic factors. Yet while
he has written an entire book on the question, "Why Taiwan? Geostrategic
Rationales for China's Territorial Integrity," he makes an enormous
concession in his conclusion that, "\... the foreign policy elites and
even individuals in the central leadership may share the conviction that
Taiwan has geostrategic salience, although conclusive evidence of that
has yet to be presented."44 This study has presented evidence that while
Taiwan has strategic value in Beijing's eyes, what is more important in
this case are "sacred commitments" and domestic political pressures.
Second, again regarding the necessary assumptions of a material-driven
approach and the outcome of this study, Beijing clearly is concerned
about the symbolic difference between (i) a Taiwan that is formally
independent, and (ii) a Taiwan that is not formally independent but
exists as a de facto independent political entity as is the case today.
Chinese leaders have stated time and again that China reserves the right
to go to war if Taiwan declares formal independence. In fact, they have
registered their vehement opposition to any removal of "Republic of
China" from ROC passports and passed an Anti-Secession Law in 2005
saying that (i) any moves by Taipei to separate itself from China, (ii)
any actual separation of Taiwan from China, or (iii) anything that
results in the permanent delaying of reunification are each sufficient
causes for Chinese use of force. Third, **[because [China is willing to
go to war over Taiwan]{.mark}]{.underline}** if the latter declares
independence, **[[even if it means war with the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates,
**[[neither strategic long-term nor short-term material interests appear
to be driving its calculations]{.underline}]{.mark}**. It must be
something else, for surely **[Beijing knows that a war]{.underline}**
with the United States over Taiwan **[would do much more to threaten
China's security]{.underline}** and other material interests **[than any
other]{.underline}** international **[scenario]{.underline}** Beijing
might imagine short of outright invasion by a foreign power or a
foreign-led insurrection inside China.45 The point is, this research and
other studies46 show that what are here called **["sacred
commitments"]{.underline}** and domestic political concerns **[have been
the driving forces]{.underline}** in Beijing's Taiwan policy, **[not
material factors and interests]{.underline}** and that because of these
factors **[China is prepared to go to war over Taiwan]{.underline}** if
it comes to that, **[[despite the costs]{.mark}.]{.underline}** A note
is due here about sacred commitments and generalizability. **[It is not
suggested here that [sacred commitments]{.mark} is a general predictor
of Chinese behavior in any given situation]{.underline}**, for the
sacred commitments **[narrative seems to be a factor [relegated to
application to Taiwan alone]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The **[sacred
narrative has not been applied by Beijing to the South China Sea, the
Diaoyu Islands or any other feature]{.underline}**. How are Chinese
commitments to Taiwan comparable to China's commitments to the East
China Sea or the South China Sea? Speaking first of similarities, China
has claims to not only Taiwan, but to islands in both the East China and
South China Seas.47 The Diaoyus/East China Sea and the South China Sea,
if possessed unchallenged by China, would bring Beijing certain
territorial, resource, and security benefits as well, as with Taiwan.
With the Diaoyu Islands, another similarity with Taiwan is that 1895 is
the year that both were taken by Japan according to the Chinese
narrative.48 Another similarity has arisen, in that recently the South
China Sea and the East China Sea have been defined as being part of
China's "core interests," which has been the case for Taiwan for as long
as the PRC has existed. The similarities end there, however. First,
neither the Diaoyu Islands nor the South China Sea has figured
prominently in China's nationalism discourse until more recently. During
WW2 ROC President Chiang Kai-shek had argued (successfully) with
Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin for the inclusion of Formosa/ Taiwan in
the Cairo and Potsdam Declarations as needing to be returned to China,
though such prominence was not given to the Diaoyu Islands or the South
China Sea. As for Mao, while he made claims about the importance of
retaking Taiwan from the establishment of the People's Republic of China
in 1949 on, there was very little discussion of the South China Sea or
the Diaoyu Islands from top Chinese leaders until the early 1970s, and
even then there was no comparison to the importance of the role played
in Chinese discourse that Taiwan has held. Second, no one lives on the
maritime features that comprise the South China Sea and the East China
Sea, except in the case of Sansha City on Yongxing (Woody) Island in the
Paracel Island Group, which quite recently has acquired approximately
600 inhabitants. Taiwan, on the other hand, has 23 million inhabitants,
approximately 98% of which have Han Chinese heritage. Moreover, those
Chinese inhabitants have created a democracy and buy their defensive
equipment from the United States. Third, Taiwan has an area of about
14,000 square miles, whereas Yongxing (Woody) Island, the largest of the
Paracels, comprises 0.8 square miles, and the five isles which comprise
the Diaoyu Islands together make up 2.7 square miles. Fourth, most of
the nations of the world recognize Taiwan as belonging historically to
China based on historical documents (only 22 nations and the Vatican
recognize the Republic of China, the rest of the world's nations
recognizing the PRC and accepting it as the sole representative of
China), demographic realities (a majority Chinese population), and at
least two international legal documents (the Cairo and Potsdam
Declarations) noting China's rightful claim to Taiwan and stating that
the island should return to China (along with other territories taken by
Japan)49 at the end of WW2. On the contrary, few nations of the world
recognize China's claims to either the East China Sea and Diaoyu Isles
or the South China Sea nine-dotted line area. Fifth, Chinese public
opinion is highly supportive of central government efforts to prevent
the separation of Taiwan from the Mainland, even if it meant war,
whereas the South and East China Seas do not have the emotional,
historical or nationalistic appeal Taiwan does to ordinary Chinese.50
**[The Chinese government enjoys little room for compromise on Taiwan as
it regards public opinion, whereas it might enjoy greater policy
flexibility in dealing with the East and South China
Seas]{.underline}**. For example, while the Chinese government might
have the flexibility to work out a compromise arrangement with Japan on
joint management of the East China Sea, etc., there will be no
compromise in Mainland Chinese policy/minds on the ultimate return of
Taiwan to the Mainland. Finally, while the Chinese government has
sharpened its rhetoric regarding its claims in the South and East China
Seas in the last few years, it has not used the emotional, "sacred
commitments" narrative in these two cases, as it has with Taiwan. For
all of these reasons, while China may in the end go to war over some of
the features in the East and South China Seas in coming years if
situations warrant it---as its confrontations with Japan
(Diaoyudao/Senkakus), the Philippines (Huangyandao/Penatag,) and Vietnam
(Spratleys and Paracels) in recent years suggest is at least a
possibility---this is not a given in the sense that war over Taiwan
would be if Taiwan were to make any moves toward independence, etc.
While they have upgraded the status of the South and East China Sea
claims to "core interests" (as has been the case with Taiwan since the
establishment of the PRC), the Chinese government has not constructed a
"sacred commitments" narrative about the South and East China's Seas.
Consequently, I would not expect the level of commitment to these areas
and their features as I would to Taiwan, I would expect greater policy
flexibility in these areas than I would with Taiwan, and I would expect
a higher threshold for major armed conflict in these areas than with
Taiwan. That said, and given the stable relations between Beijing and
Taipei presently, minor armed conflict (skirmishes) over maritime
features in the East and South Chinese Seas may in the short term be a
greater danger than armed conflict over Taiwan, which would be of a more
serious nature given the long history of unresolved conflict, the
significant military forces arrayed on both sides of the Strait, the
emotionalism, and the proximity of a large non-combatant population
which could be impacted on both sides of the Strait. Another question
that might arise in response to the arguments presented here is why has
China exhibited some degree of policy flexibility toward Taiwan though
sacred commitments must be viewed more or less as a constant? Sacred
commitments as argument claims to explain motivations, but makes no
pretense of explaining tactics, or what policymakers will actually do in
a given situation. Actual policy in any state is impacted by many
factors, including domestic policy, perceptions, events, and strategic
and cost--benefit analyses of achieving desired goals, etc. Beijing's
policy flexibility, where seen, depends on situational, domestic
political, strategic and other factors including political trends in
Taiwan such as the election of Ma with his more amiable Beijing policy,
all depending on which season of policy flexibility is being addressed.
Conclusions and Implications for Theory and Policy The most basic
Chinese interest in the crisis in the Taiwan Strait in 1995--1996 was to
prevent any moves by Taiwan toward becoming independent primarily
because of China's "sacred commitments" to reunification and secondarily
because of concerns among the leadership that the loss of Taiwan would
be a serious blow to their legitimacy.51 Wrapped up in all of this was
China's identity as a developing "socialist state with Chinese
characteristics" which has suffered a "century of humiliation" and is
informed by "the victimization narrative" (Gries 2001), all of which
made the government and people of the PRC very sensitive to events
regarding Taiwan (Wang 2012). In Beijing's eyes Lee Teng-hui's visit to
the United States and his highly political speech at Cornell symbolized
both Lee-inspired Taiwan separatism and American complicity therein.
This was in part due to the Chinese misperception that Clinton could and
would block the Lee visa in Congress, and China's misperception as to US
motives in the Strait (believing that the United States really was bent
on encouraging Taiwan to become independent).52 Consequently, by
granting Lee a visa, the Chinese concluded that America had threatened a
vital Chinese interest---it had challenged China's "sacred commitments"
to Taiwan. After the Lee visit, China's commitment to preventing Taiwan
from declaring independence meant a need to deter Taiwan from walking
down the road to independence, which the Chinese sought to achieve by
missile firings and military exercises in and around the Taiwan Strait
in 1995 and 1996. This study has concluded that China's interest in
regaining Taiwan53 is constituted by a combination of the following
variables, in order of salience: "sacred commitments," domestic politics
(which include leaders' fear of angering people and leaders' fear of
loss of legitimacy and loss of power if Taiwan was let go), security
interests, the fear that losing Taiwan could presage a loss of other
areas (Tibet, etc.), and economic interests. It has concluded that all
of these have worked in conjunction to serve construct China's
"interest" in and policy of striving to regain (or at least not lose)
Taiwan. These are not mutually exclusive because, for example, the
domestic political pressure on the leaders not to "lose" Taiwan comes in
part from the peoples' own notion of "sacred commitments" to Taiwan,
which was created in part by government-run media sources and
educational institutions. Likewise, strategic and economic interests in
Taiwan put pressure on the leaders not to let Taiwan go, but to honor
these "sacred commitments." The fear of the precedent of letting Taiwan
go, as it regards independence movements in Tibet and Xinjiang, also
added to the pressure on the leaders not to compromise on Taiwan. Though
not equal in their impact, these things all worked together to shape
policy and bring about the policy outcome described above. Understanding
their interplay is not a clean, tidy, or necessarily scientific process,
however. This is why triangulation via the tripartite method described
here was selected as a way of trying to understand the factors that were
most salient in the minds of the policymakers in this case. This study
has a number of theoretical implications, the most important of which is
the role of ideational factors, sacred commitments in particular, in
China's Taiwan policy. It has been conventional wisdom54 to see China's
foreign policy as very much in the tradition of realpolitik. 55 However,
while many ascribe to China Realist world views and the primacy of
realpolitik-driven foreign policy proclivities, as it concerns this
particular case China's policy toward Taiwan in the 1995--1996 crisis
seems to have been driven more so by idealpolitik---or more
specifically, constructed notions of a "sacred commitment" to
reunification---than toward the strategic and material gains it could
gain by reunification. This is consistent with a school of thought, as
it regards understanding China's foreign policy, that material-driven,
rational choice approaches to understanding Chinese foreign policy do
not get us as far as approaches that utilize in addition (or in some
cases exclusively) non-material (ideational, social, normative,
identity-based, etc.) factors toward the same end.56 Making this same
case is Taiwan-based scholar Shih Chih-yu, who argues that if in fact
security considerations were Beijing's primary concern regarding
Taiwan's importance, why not just let Taiwan become independent, and
then seek a security pact with it? He maintains that it was not Chinese
concerns about national security that motivated the strong Chinese show
of force in the Taiwan Strait in 1995 and 1996, but rather nationalism
and emotionalism that were the primary motivating forces,57 arguing that
despite its possible use as a forward naval base, Taiwan is in fact more
trouble than it's worth, particularly if its attainment meant war with
the United States, which could truly threaten Mainland China's national
security. Thomas Christensen's study of Chinese foreign policy behavior
concurs with Shih's conclusions. Since realpolitik would suggest
attention to political realities, not legalities, it is puzzling why the
change from de facto independence, which Taiwan has had since 1949, to
legal independence would drive China to risk damage to its economy and
war with the world's only superpower \[the US\]. But there is convincing
evidence that China is prepared to do just that." (Christensen 1996:45)
Christensen buttresses the point that an ahistorical Realism just does
not explain China's attitudes toward Taiwan, for China's obsession with
Taiwan is simply not "rational" from a conventional rationalist,
utilitarian, or material-driven Realist perspective. Taken alone,
perhaps China's "sacred" rhetoric might be seen as simply rhetoric. Yet
considering the consistency with which this language has been used by
China's highest officials and its scholars and researchers, and taken
against the backdrop of the comments of the respondents in this study,
it must be taken seriously. Subsequently, a number of policy
implications flow from this study. First, policymakers in the United
States and Taiwan must remain clear that China's commitment to Taiwan is
unwavering, not entirely "rational"58 from a realpolitik perspective,
and is even "sacred" in nature. While pragmatism probably is the
reigning worldview in China today and much of China's foreign policy
behavior is consistent with it, its approach to Taiwan is different, as
this study has shown. Relations between Beijing and Taipei have since
2008 been good, and we all hope they'll continue to improve. Yet this is
not a given, however, because (i) the stakes for Beijing have not
changed (Beijing still wants Taiwan back and will not compromise on
that), (ii) Taiwan is a democracy and so a continuation of today's
relatively Beijing-friendly policy under the Ma Administration is not
guaranteed, and (iii) with Beijing's growing economic and military
capabilities the scales are slowly tipping in its favor if it does
eventually decide to resort to force.59 The second implication of this
study is that armed conflict in the Taiwan Strait, with China on one
side and Taiwan and the United States on the other, remains all too easy
to slip into, even today. **[[Though]{.underline}]{.mark}** the
**[increasing [economic interdependence]{.mark}]{.underline}** between
Mainland China and Taiwan **[certainly [raises the costs]{.mark} of
going to war, [it is not clear that it has lessened the dangers of
conflict]{.mark} considerably]{.underline}** once the term of the
present leadership in Taiwan comes to an end in 2016, **[particularly as
the balance of power across the Strait continues to tip in Beijing's
favor]{.underline}**.60 Third, and consequently, the United States will
have little choice but to continue its "double deterrence" policy toward
Beijing and Taipei (Bush 2013), that is, attempting to deter Beijing
from using force vis a\` vis Taiwan, and at the same time attempting to
deter Taiwan from moves toward independence or otherwise unilaterally
altering the status quo between it and China. This would include
continuing to sell Taiwan, in the least provocative (to Beijing) manner
possible, the basic tools Taiwan needs for its defense (Kan 2013), while
doing all it can to maintain good relations with both Beijing and
Taipei. Washington might do a better job as well of communicating to
Beijing that it is not opposed to reunification as long as Taiwan finds
the means thereto acceptable. In this respect, there is a fundamental
misunderstanding of US policy on Beijing's part, for **[Beijing seems
convinced that the United States is bent on keeping Taiwan and the
Mainland divided]{.underline}**.61 This study found that in this classic
confrontation between a status quo hegemonic power (the United States)
and a rising power (China), squaring off over a wealthy island in a
strategic waterway (Taiwan), **[there is]{.underline}** surprisingly
**[[little evidence that]{.mark} the stuff of standard
[material-driven]{.mark} discourse on [security concerns]{.mark} and
balancing [drove China's policy.]{.mark}]{.underline}** All of this
leads to the conclusion that while Realism may be the best lens through
which to view some foreign policy behavior, in this case it **[[would
not have been very fruitful to employ Realist approaches to SinoAmerican
relations]{.underline}]{.mark}**, depending as they do so exclusively on
strategic material factors and material definitions of interests for
their explanatory power. For cases such as this one, more fruitful are
approaches like constructivism, and methodologies like the one employed
in this study, that incorporate domestic politics, interests defined in
non-material ways, and non-material (ideational and social) factors more
fully and systematically. Failing to do so leaves one with the
unfortunate consequence of overlooking or at least under accounting for
the force of factors such as China's "sacred commitments" to Taiwan.

Why is the political status of Taiwan so important to China? **[For

sovereignty]{.mark} and territorial integrity.]{.underline}** That
itself is important for any country. Second, **[it is also a matter of
[national dignity and respect]{.mark}]{.underline}**. For over a hundred
years **[after the Opium War]{.underline}** in 1840, **[imperialist

independent and regained most of its territories. However, **[[Taiwan

Russia's invasion of **[Ukraine has raised the specter of nuclear
war]{.underline}**, as Russian President Vladimir Putin has placed his
nuclear forces at an elevated state of alert and has warned that any
effort by outside parties to interfere in the war would result in
"consequences you have never seen." Such saber-rattling has
understandably made headlines and drawn notice in Washington. **[But [if
China attempted to]{.mark} forcibly [invade Taiwan]{.mark} and the
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[came to Taipei's aid,
the threat of escalation could outstrip]{.underline}** even
**[the]{.underline}** current nerve-wracking **[situation in
Europe]{.underline}**.

A recent war game, conducted by the Center for a New American Security
in conjunction with the NBC program "Meet the Press," demonstrated just
how quickly such a conflict could escalate. The game posited a fictional
crisis set in 2027, with the aim of examining how the United States and
China might act under a certain set of conditions. The game demonstrated
that **[China's military modernization and expansion of its nuclear
arsenal---not to mention the importance Beijing places on unification
with Taiwan---mean]{.underline}** that, in the real world, **[[a
fight]{.mark} between China and the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates could very well **[[go
nuclear]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Beijing views Taiwan as a breakaway republic. **[[If the
C]{.underline}]{.mark}**hinese **[[C]{.underline}]{.mark}**ommunist
**[[P]{.underline}]{.mark}**arty decides to
**[[invade]{.underline}]{.mark}** the island, **[[its leaders may
not]{.underline}]{.mark}** be able to **[[accept
failure]{.underline}]{.mark}** without seriously harming the regime's
legitimacy. Thus, **[the CCP might]{.underline}** be willing to **[take
significant risks to ensure that the conflict ends on terms that it
finds acceptable]{.underline}**. That would mean convincing the United
States and its allies that the costs of defending Taiwan are so high
that it is not worth contesting the invasion. While China has several
ways to achieve that goal, from Beijing's perspective, **[using
[nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s may be the most effective]{.mark} means to
keep the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[out of the
conflict]{.underline}**.

China is several decades into transforming its People's Liberation Army
(PLA) into what the Chinese President Xi Jinping has called a
"world-class military" that could defeat any third party that comes to
Taiwan's defense. China's warfighting strategy, known as
"anti-access/area denial," rests on being able to project conventional
military power out several thousand miles in order to prevent the
American military, in particular, from effectively countering a Chinese
attack on Taiwan. Meanwhile, a growing nuclear arsenal provides Beijing
with coercive leverage as well as potentially new warfighting
capabilities, which could increase the risks of war and escalation.

China has historically possessed only a few hundred ground-based nuclear
weapons. But last year, nuclear scholars at the James Martin Center for
Nonproliferation Studies and the Federation of American Scientists
identified three missile silo fields under construction in the Xinjiang
region. The Financial Times reported that China might have carried out
tests of hypersonic gliders as a part of an orbital bombardment system
that could evade missile defenses and deliver nuclear weapons to targets
in the continental United States. The U.S. Department of Defense
projects that by 2030, China will have around 1,000 deliverable
warheads---more than triple the number it currently possesses. Based on
these projections, Chinese leaders may believe that as early as five
years from now the PLA will have made enough conventional and nuclear
gains that it could fight and win a war to unify with Taiwan.

Our recent war game---in which members of Congress, former government
officials, and subject matter experts assumed the roles of senior
national security decision makers in China and the United
States---illustrated that **[[a]{.mark} U.S.-Chinese [war]{.mark} could
[escalate quickly]{.mark}]{.underline}**. For one thing, it showed that
**[[both countries]{.mark} would [face]{.mark} operational [incentives
to strike]{.mark}]{.underline}** military forces on **[[the other's
territory]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In the game, such strikes were
intended to be calibrated to avoid escalation; both sides tried to walk
a fine line by attacking only military targets. But **[such [attacks
crossed red lines]{.mark} for both countries, [and produced a]{.mark}
tit-for-tat [cycle]{.mark} of attacks [that broadened]{.mark} the scope
and [intensity]{.mark} of the conflict]{.underline}**.

For instance, in the simulation, China launched a preemptive attack
against key U.S. bases in the Indo-Pacific region. The attacks targeted
Guam, in particular, because it is a forward operating base critical to
U.S. military operations in Asia, and because since it is a territory,
and not a U.S. state, the Chinese team viewed striking it as less
escalatory than attacking other possible targets. In response, the
United States targeted Chinese military ships in ports and surrounding
facilities, but refrained from other attacks on the Chinese mainland.
Nevertheless, both sides perceived these strikes as attacks on their
home territory, crossing an important threshold. Instead of
mirror-imaging their own concerns about attacks on their territory, each
side justified the initial blows as military necessities that were
limited in nature and would be seen by the other as such. Responses to
the initial strikes only escalated things further as the U.S. team
responded to China's moves by hitting targets in mainland China, and the
Chinese team responded to Washington's strikes by attacking sites in
Hawaii.

A NEW ERA

One particularly alarming finding from the war game is that China found
it necessary to threaten to go nuclear from the start in order to ward
off outside support for Taiwan. This threat was repeated throughout the
game, particularly after mainland China had been attacked. At times,
efforts to erode Washington's will so that it would back down from the
fight received greater attention by the China team than the invasion of
Taiwan itself. But China had difficulty convincing the United States
that its nuclear threats were credible. In real life, China's
significant and recent changes to its nuclear posture and readiness may
impact other nations' views, as its nuclear threats may not be viewed as
credible given its stated doctrine of no first use, its smaller but
burgeoning nuclear arsenal, and lack of experience making nuclear
threats. This may push China to preemptively detonate a nuclear weapon
to reinforce the credibility of its warning.

China might also resort to a demonstration of its nuclear might because
of constraints on its long-range conventional strike capabilities. Five
years from now, the PLA still will have a very limited ability to launch
conventional attacks beyond locations in the "second island chain" in
the Pacific; namely, Guam and Palau. Unable to strike the U.S. homeland
with conventional weapons, China would struggle to impose costs on the
American people. Up until a certain point in the game, the U.S. team
felt its larger nuclear arsenal was sufficient to deter escalation and
did not fully appreciate the seriousness of China's threats. As a
result, China felt it needed to escalate significantly to send a message
that the U.S. homeland could be at risk if Washington did not back down.
Despite China's stated "no-first use" nuclear policy, the war game
resulted in Beijing detonating a nuclear weapon off the coast of Hawaii
as a demonstration. The attack caused relatively little destruction, as
the electromagnetic pulse only damaged the electronics of ships in the
immediate vicinity but did not directly impact the U.S. state. The war
game ended before the U.S. team could respond, but it is likely that the
first use of a nuclear weapon since World War II would have provoked a
response.

The most likely paths to nuclear escalation in a fight between the
United States and China are different from those that were most likely
during the Cold War. The Soviet Union and the United States feared a
massive, bolt-from-the-blue nuclear attack, which would precipitate a
full-scale strategic exchange. In a confrontation over Taiwan, however,
Beijing could employ nuclear weapons in a more limited way to signal
resolve or to improve its chances of winning on the battlefield. It is
unclear how a war would proceed after that kind of limited nuclear use
and whether the United States could de-escalate the situation while
still achieving its objectives.

AN OUNCE OF PREVENTION

The clear lesson from the war game is that **[the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[needs to strengthen its conventional
capabilities]{.underline}** in the Indo-Pacific **[[to ensure]{.mark}
that [China never views]{.mark} an [invasion]{.mark} of Taiwan
[as]{.mark} a [prudent]{.mark} tactical move]{.underline}**. To do so,
the United States will need to commit to maintaining its conventional
military superiority by expanding its stockpiles of long-range munitions
and investing in undersea capabilities. Washington must also be able to
conduct offensive operations inside the first and second island chains
even while under attack. This will require access to new bases to
distribute U.S. forces, enhance their survivability, and ensure that
they can effectively defend Taiwan in the face of China's attacks.

Moreover, **[[the U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[[needs to]{.underline}]{.mark}**
develop an integrated network of partners willing to **[[contribute to
Taiwan]{.mark}'s defense]{.underline}**. Allies are an asymmetric
advantage: the United States has them, and China does not. The United
States should **[[deepen]{.mark} strategic and operational
[planning]{.mark} with key partners [to]{.mark} send a strong [signal of
resolve]{.mark} to China]{.underline}**. As part of these planning
efforts, the United States and its allies will need to develop
war-winning military strategies that do not cross Chinese red-lines. The
game highlighted just how difficult this task may be; what it did not
highlight is the complexity of developing military strategies that
integrate the strategic objectives and military capacities of multiple
nations.

Moving forward, military planners in the United States and in

[[The most **worrisome**]{.mark} **[flash point]{.mark} [for a
U.S.-Chinese war is Taiwan]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Beijing\'s long-term
objective of reunifying the island with mainland China is clearly in
conflict with Washington\'s longstanding desire to maintain the status
quo in the strait. It is not difficult to imagine how this might lead to
war. For example, [[China could decide]{.mark}
[that]{.mark}]{.underline} [[the]{.mark} political]{.underline} [or
military **[window]{.mark}** [for regaining control]{.mark}]{.underline}
over the island [**[was closing and launch an attack]{.mark}**,
[using]{.mark}]{.underline} air and [[naval forces to blockade Taiwanese
harbors]{.underline}]{.mark} or bombard the island. [Although U.S. law
does not require Washington to intervene]{.underline} in such a
scenario, [the T]{.underline}aiwan [R]{.underline}elations
[A]{.underline}ct [states]{.underline} that [the United States will
\"consider any effort to determine the future of Taiwan by other than
peaceful means]{.underline}, including by boycotts or embargoes, [a
threat to the peace and security of the Western Pacific area and of
grave concern to the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates.\" [[Were
Washington to intervene]{.underline}]{.mark} on Taipei\'s behalf, [the
world\'s sole superpower and its rising competitor [would find
themselves in **the first great-power war** of the twenty-first
century]{.mark}]{.underline}[. In]{.mark} the course of such a war, U.S.
conventional military operations would likely threaten, disable, or
outright eliminate some Chinese nuclear capabilities- whether doing so
was Washington\'s stated objective or not. In fact, if the United States
engaged in the style of warfare it has practiced over the last 30 years,
this outcome would be all but guaranteed. [[Consider submarine
warfare]{.mark}. [China could use its conventionally armed attack
sub]{.mark}]{.underline}marine[s [to blockade Taiwanese harbors]{.mark}
or bomb the island]{.underline}, or to attack U.S. and allied forces in
the region. If that happened, [[the U.S. Navy]{.mark} [would]{.mark}
almost certainly [undertake an antisub]{.mark}]{.underline}marine
[[campaign,]{.mark} which would]{.underline} likely [threaten China\'s
\"boomers,\" the]{.underline} four [nuclear armed ballistic missile
sub]{.underline}marine[s that form its naval nuclear deterrent.
China\'s]{.underline} conventionally armed and [nuclear-armed
sub]{.underline}marine[s share the same shore-based
com]{.underline}munications [system]{.underline}; [[a U.S. attack
on]{.mark}]{.underline} these [[transmitters would]{.mark} thus not only
disrupt the activities of China\'s attack sub]{.underline}marine [force
but also [cut off its boomers]{.mark} [from contact with
Beijing]{.mark}, l[eaving Chinese leaders **unsure of the fate of their
naval nuclear forc**]{.mark}**e**.]{.underline} [In addition, nuclear
ballistic missile sub]{.underline}marine[s depend on attack submarines
for protection]{.underline}, just as lumbering bomber aircraftrely on
nimble fighter jets. [If the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[started sinking Chinese attack submarines, it would be sinking the very
force that protects China\'s ballistic missile sub]{.underline}marine[s,
leaving the latter dramatically more vulnerable]{.underline}. [Even more
dangerous, U.S. forces hunting Chinese attack sub]{.underline}marine[s
could inadvertently sink a Chinese boomer instead]{.underline}. After
all, at least some Chinese attack submarines might be escorting
ballistic missile submarines, especially in wartime, when China might
flush its boomers from their ports and try to send them within range of
the continental United States. [[Since correctly identifying
targets]{.mark} [remains one of the trickiest challenges]{.mark} [of
undersea warfare,]{.mark} a U.S. sub]{.underline}marine [crew might come
within shooting range of a Chinese sub]{.underline}marine [without being
sure of its type]{.underline}, especially in a crowded, noisy
environment like the Taiwan Strait. Platitudes about caution are easy in
peacetime. In wartime, when Chinese attack submarines might already have
launched deadly strikes, [[the U.S. crew might decide to **shoot first**
and **ask questions later**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Adding to China\'s
sense of vulnerability, the small size of its nucleararmed submarine
force means that just two such incidents would eliminate half of its
sea-based deterrent. Meanwhile, any Chinese boomers that escaped this
fate would likely be cut offfrom communication with onshore commanders,
leftwithout an escort force, and unable to return to destroyed ports. If
that happened, China would essentially have no naval nuclear deterrent.

Today, [**the People's Republic of China (PRC)**]{.underline} and the
Russian Federation (RF) **[employ all instruments of their national
power to undermine and remake the international system to serve their
own interests.]{.underline}** Each conduct a variety of malign
activities incrementally, attempting to achieve their objectives without
triggering a military response. Both nations back their revisionist
activities with regionally powerful militaries and obscure their
aggressive behavior by mixing military and paramilitary forces with
proxies. China's and Russia's attempts to exert control over natural
marine resources and restrict access to the oceans have negative
repercussions for all nations. **[China has implemented a strategy and
revisionist approach that aims at the heart of the United States'
maritime power. It seeks to corrode international maritime governance,
deny access to traditional logistical hubs, inhibit freedom of the seas,
control use of key chokepoints, deter our engagement in regional
disputes]{.underline}**, and displace the United States as the preferred
partner in countries around the world. **[To enable its strategy, China
deploys a]{.underline}** multilayered fleet that includes **[the
People's Liberation Army Navy, the China Coast Guard, and the People's
Armed Forces Maritime Militia]{.underline}**---naval auxiliaries
disguised as civilian vessels---**[to subvert other nations' sovereignty
and enforce unlawful claims. It continues to militarize disputed
features in the South China Sea]{.underline}** and assert maritime
claims inconsistent with international law. Its state-subsidized
distantwater fishing fleet steals vital resources from nations unable to
defend their own exclusive economic zones. To support its multilayered
fleet[, **China is also developing the world's largest missile force,
with nuclear capabilities, which is designed to strike U.S. and allied
forces in Guam and in the Far East with everything from ballistic
missiles to maneuverable cruise and hypersonic missiles.**]{.underline}
Further, [**China has centralized its robust strategic, space, cyber,
electronic, and psychological warfare capabilities**.]{.underline} With
**[naval forces as the cornerstone of its efforts, China is aggressively
growing and modernizing its military. Already commanding the world's
largest naval force]{.underline}**, the PRC is building modern surface
combatants, submarines, aircraft carriers, fighter jets, amphibious
assault ships, ballistic nuclear missile submarines, large coast guard
cutters, and polar Figure 1: Growth of China's maritime forces since

icebreakers at alarming speed. China's navy battle force has more than
tripled in size in only two decades (Figure 1). This rapid growth is
enabled by a robust shipbuilding infrastructure, including multiple
shipyards that exceed those in the United States in both size and
throughput. In conflict, excess PRC industrial capacity, including
additional commercial shipyards, could quickly be turned toward military
production and repair, further increasing China's ability to generate
new military forces. Whereas U.S. naval forces are globally dispersed,
supporting U.S. interests and deterring aggression from multiple
threats, China's numerically larger forces are primarily concentrated in
the Western Pacific. However, as China seeks to establish regional
hegemony, it is also expanding its global reach. China's One Belt One
Road initiative is extending its overseas logistics and basing
infrastructure that will enable its forces to operate farther from its
shores than ever before, including the polar regions, Indian Ocean, and
Atlantic Ocean. These projects often leverage predatory lending terms
that China exploits to control access to key strategic maritime
locations.

### 2AC \-\-- China Navy Dom = Taiwan Invasion

#### Chinese naval dominance in the SCS leads to Taiwan invasion

**Carpenter 19**, Ted Galen Carpenter is senior fellow for defense and
foreign policy studies at the Cato Institute, (7-15-19"China Flexes Its
Military Muscles in the Western Pacific", Cato Institue,
<https://www.cato.org/commentary/china-flexes-its-military-muscles-western-pacific>)MS

It was just a matter of time until the surging economic capabilities of
the People's Republic of China would translate into more serious
military capabilities. After more than two decades of annual (usually
double‐​digit) boosts in defense spending, that time has arrived.
**[China's new clout is especially evident with the deployment of a
modern navy equipped with an array of sophisticated weapons systems.
Beijing's policies in the South China Sea, the Taiwan Strait, and to
some extent throughout the Western Pacific, are exhibiting greater
assertiveness to match its's rising military clout. That posture is
leading to mounting tensions with the United States]{.underline}** and
Washington's East Asian allies. **[It will be an important challenge for
both sides to manage such frictions so that they do not produce a war
that would be disastrous for all concerned.]{.underline}** Beijing\'s
military buildup and modernization has reached the point that US
policymakers and defense planners are paying very close attention. The
US Defense Intelligence Agency\'s 2019 report to **[Congress concludes
that Beijing is building up its ground, air, and naval forces to achieve
a more robust capability to invade Taiwan]{.underline}**. Some of those
moves also apply to China\'s ambitions in other areas of the Western
Pacific. China has focused especially on developing potent anti-access,
area denial (A2/AD) capabilities in recent years. Deployment of a new
generation of anti-ship missiles and torpedoes, surface to air missiles,
and aerial defense systems, is central to that strategy. Such weapons
increase the vulnerability of US forces if Washington contemplates
intervening militarily to prevent a Chinese armed initiative against
Taiwan. They also materially reduce the advantage that US naval and air
forces currently enjoy in the South China Sea. Beijing\'s apparent
expectation is that it can raise the risk level to the United States
high enough that US leaders will have to reconsider the strategy of
maintaining US primacy in the Western Pacific, especially in the Taiwan
Strait and the South China Sea. Xi Jinping pledged to complete the
modernisation of the country's military by 2035 and to transform it into
a world-class fighting force by 2050 It is not a far-fetched goal. Some
**[US analysts and pundits believe that Beijing already is becoming
America\'s full-fledged military peer competitor in the
Pacific]{.underline}**. That concern seems premature, since it is
unlikely that China can hope to match the US militarily on a global
basis (or even throughout the Pacific Basin) for several more decades,
if then. But matching or even exceeding Washington\'s air and naval
power throughout the Western Pacific, especially in China\'s\'s
immediate neighborhood, is another matter. Beijing may be very close to
achieving that goal already. As its military power has expanded,
**[China\'s behavior has become noticeably more assertive, if not
aggressive, in such locales as the East China Sea, the Taiwan Strait,
and the South China Sea.]{.underline}** In the East China Sea, Beijing
is contesting Japan\'s control of the Senkaku islands and pressing its
own claim to that territory. In addition to national pride, the China\'s
pressure reflects a desire to control extensive fishing resources and
probable oil and mineral wealth in the waters surrounding the
uninhabited Senkakus. The Japanese government has refused to budge on
the territorial dispute, and Washington firmly backs Tokyo\'s position,
but officials in both countries are increasingly worried about the
extent of Chinese military power in that area. **[Beijing's belligerence
is even more evident in the Taiwan Strait. China conducted 16 military
drills around Taiwan in 2017 alone]{.underline}**, compared to just
eight in 2016 and even fewer during the previous decade. The accelerated
pace continued in 2018 and into 2019. Beijing's naval and air power war
games included having a flotilla led by an aircraft carrier, transit
through the Strait. A senior Chinese official, Liu Junchuan, boasted
that "the contrast in power across the Taiwan Strait will become wider
and wider, and we will have a full, overwhelming strategic advantage
over Taiwan." Speaking on June 1, 2019, at the Shangri-La Dialogue, an
annual multilateral conference on Pacific security issues, Defense
Minister Wei Fenghe warned against efforts either in Taiwan or foreign
countries to thwart China's goal of reunification. Wei added ominously
that, "If anyone dares to split Taiwan from China, the Chinese military
will have no choice but to fight at all costs, for national unity." In
addition to its own accelerated military activities in the Taiwan
Strait, **[China is reacting with more intense hostility to the presence
of naval vessels from any other country in those waters]{.underline}**.
Most of Beijing's angry protests have been directed at the United States
for sending warships through the Strait, but Chinese officials display
similar intolerance toward other powers. An especially odd incident
occurred in April 2019 when, for reasons not entirely clear, France sent
one of its naval vessels through the Strait. Beijing responded with a
vitriolic protest. **[It is increasingly evident that Chinese leaders
not only regard Taiwan as part of China, but they consider the Strait to
be Chinese territorial waters.]{.underline}**

**[While, [Turkish President]{.mark} Recep Tayyip Erdogan [said]{.mark}
that [his government was vigilant]{.mark}]{.underline}** and had taken
necessary steps, **[the [threat of undiffused mines]{.mark} crossing the
Bosphorus [lingers]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[On the west of the
Bosphorus lies the Mediterranean]{.underline}**- consisting of European
countries like Greece, Italy and France; African countries including
Egypt, Algeria and Morocco and the Jewish state of Israel. Arab states,
including Lebanon and Syria, which are already shadowed by decades of
war, also lie on the Mediterranean coast. **[[Turkey]{.mark}, which
holds control over the Bosphorus [is under maximum
threat]{.mark}. Experts and observers have opined that [even a single
explosion could lead to heavy destruction.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**[Notably, a [total of 420 mines were deployed off the coast of
Odesa]{.mark} by Ukrainian authorities]{.underline}** to deter Russian
troops. It **[is now known how many of them are currently floating free
in the Black Sea or if any of them had entered the Mediterranean, but
experts have said the [mines]{.mark}-each containing 20 kgs of TNT-
[pose a serious threat to ships, cargoes and towns located at
coasts]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

#### Those mines undermine the Black sea economy which is key to food, semiconductors, supply shipping, and the global economy Joshua **Keating 22**, Joshua Keating is a global security reporter for Grid focused on conflict, diplomacy and foreign policy, author of the book, \"Invisible Countries: Journeys to the Edge of Nationhood," a graduate of Oberlin College, 5/25/22, "Why the battle for the Black Sea may be the most important showdown in the war --- for Ukraine and for the world," Grid, <https://www.grid.news/story/global/2022/05/25/why-the-battle-for-the-black-sea-may-be-the-most-important-showdown-in-the-war-for-ukraine-and-for-the-world/>, JH

**[Russia had an advantage in the Black Sea from the
start]{.underline}**. Prior to 2014, both countries maintained naval
fleets in Crimea under a [treaty signed in the
1990s](https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/01/world/setting-past-aside-russia-and-ukraine-sign-friendship-treaty.html).
When Russian President Vladimir Putin's forces annexed the Crimean
Peninsula, they also took over about [75 percent of Ukraine's
fleet](https://www.defensenews.com/naval/2021/08/09/after-2014-decimation-ukrainian-navy-rebuilds-to-fend-off-russia/),
leaving it reliant on a "mosquito fleet" of mostly small patrol boats to
defend its southern coast.

In the early days of the current war, **[[Russia's navy]{.mark} [[moved
quickly to
enact](https://warontherocks.com/2022/04/the-russo-ukrainian-war-at-sea-retrospect-and-prospect/) a
blockade]{.mark} of the Ukrainian coast. It closed off the Kerch Strait,
which connects the smaller Sea of Azov to the Black Sea.]{.underline}**
The important Sea of Azov port cities of Berdyansk and Mariupol have
since fallen to Russian forces. Some 20 Russian naval vessels including
six submarines are also patrolling the southern coast.

**[Further west, Russian warships and the forces now stationed on Snake
Island are also enforcing a blockade on Odessa]{.underline}**, Ukraine's
largest seaport. Ukrainian forces have been fighting to retake
the [now-iconic
outcropping](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61406808), hoping to
prevent the Russians from setting up surface-to-air missile capabilities
there.

**[[Adding to the danger are hundreds of sea mines]{.mark} that both
sides placed off Ukraine's coast in the early days of the war. Many of
these mines [[have become
unmoored]{.mark}](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/floating-mines-black-sea-endangering-grain-oil-trade-officials-2022-04-05/) and
are floating into open waters, imperiling shipping.]{.underline}**

**[The result is that, even though Russia has not formally declared a
blockade, that's the current reality. "[No one's going to take a chance
of going in there right now]{.mark}, either running astray of mines or
the Russian navy,"]{.underline}** Sal Mercogliano, a former merchant
mariner and shipping historian, told Grid. Even if a shipping company
were willing to take the risk, insurance rates are skyrocketing, making
travel to Ukrainian ports prohibitively expensive. **[At [least 80
merchant
ships](https://www.ft.com/content/8151ba97-5c07-4cef-9ad9-234c532b2481) are
stuck in Ukrainian ports, and at least 10 have been
attacked.]{.underline}**

A few ships have been moving along coastal routes between Odessa and the
Black Sea's outlet to the Danube River at the town of Izmail. In theory,
this could allow Ukraine to ship goods as far west as the Netherlands
via Europe's inland waterways. Unfortunately, Izmail also lies within
artillery range of Snake Island.

Economic impact

The [effect of international sanctions on Russia's
economy](https://www.grid.news/story/global/2022/05/12/is-the-russian-economy-stabilizing-or-doomed-both/) has
gotten more attention, but **[the damage done to the country where
fighting is actually taking place has been far more
profound.]{.underline}**

**[The [World Bank
projects](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/04/ukraine-economy-decline-war/#:~:text=World%20Bank%3A%20Ukraine%20economy%20to%20contract%20by%2045%25%20in%202022,global%20slowdown%20and%20surging%20inflation.) that
Ukraine's economy will contract by up to 45 percent this
year]{.underline}**. Some of this is pure physical destruction: The Kyiv
School of Economics estimated that as of the beginning of May, the
war [had caused \$94
billion](https://kse.ua/about-the-school/news/direct-damage-caused-to-ukraine-s-infrastructure-during-the-war-has-reached-over-94-billion/) in
infrastructure damage. **[Then there's the lost economic output of the 6
million Ukrainians who have left the country, and the roughly equal
number who have been internally displaced.]{.underline}**

**[But when asked about the first thing [the international community
could]{.mark} do to support Ukraine's economy, Natalie Jaresko, the
country's former minister of finance, answered "[unblock the
ports]{.mark}." Prior to the war, Black Sea shipping accounted for half
of the country's total external [trade]{.mark} and 90 percent of its
trade in grains including wheat and sunflower oil. [Ukraine is the
world's [fourth-largest grain
exporter](https://www.reuters.com/business/ukraine-could-lose-6-bln-grain-exports-with-ports-blocked-2022-03-21/),
and losses could top \$6 billion]{.mark}.]{.underline}** "There's about
20 million tons sitting in storage that has to be exported to make room
for the new harvest," Jaresko said. "Otherwise, we know something's
going to rot."

**[[Critical as food is, it's not the only commodity]{.mark} affected by
the maritime blockade. [Ukraine produces]{.mark} [around [half the
world's
supply](https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-ukraine-halts-half-worlds-neon-output-chips-clouding-outlook-2022-03-11/) of
the neon gas used to produce semiconductor chips]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Ukraine is also a [major producer of the wire

in European cars' electrical systems.

**[All of these goods have traditionally left Ukraine by
sea.]{.underline}**

The shutdown of Ukraine's most important trade route has left the
country heavily dependent on foreign aid. The good news for Ukrainians:
They are receiving quite a bit of aid. The \$40 billion economic
assistance package passed by Congress last week includes [\$8.76 billion
in economic
assistance](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/5/19/unprecedented-us-congress-passes-massive-ukraine-aid-package).
But these funds are neither sufficient nor sustainable in the long run.

the still-critical role of shipping in the global
economy]{.mark}]{.underline}**. "We have a kind of global 'sea
blindness,'" he told Grid. "We think everything can just be airlifted
out. It can't. Grain is too heavy and bulky. And it would be extremely
expensive to truck it all."

**[Critical as it is for Ukraine, the effects of the blockade are being
felt globally via disruptions to the [international food
supply](https://www.grid.news/story/360/2022/04/04/casualty-of-war-in-ukraine-the-global-food-supply/),

#### Semiconductor shortages sparks US China War

Julian E. **Barnes 22**, Julian E. Barnes is a national security
reporter for The New York Times covering the intelligence agencies,
1/26/22, "How the Computer Chip Shortage Could Incite a U.S. Conflict
With China," *The New York Times*,
https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/26/us/politics/computer-chip-shortage-taiwan.html

WASHINGTON --- The war game scenario conducted by a Washington think
tank began with a sudden failure at three Taiwanese semiconductor
foundries that make high-end computer chips used in such items as
smartphones, automobiles and military equipment.

The halt in production raised questions of whether a cyberattack by
Beijing was responsible --- touching off an international crisis between
China and the United States that the researchers said could grind the
global economy to a halt and incite a military confrontation.

The war game and **[[study]{.mark} by the Center for a New American
Security]{.underline}**, which is set to be released on Thursday**[,
[illustrate how dependent the world is on]{.mark} Taiwanese computer
[chips]{.mark} --- and how that dependence [could draw the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and China into various]{.mark} kinds of
[conflict]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

The report comes as Congress has put new energy into bills to increase
domestic production of semiconductors in the United States. Diversifying
the global supply chain for computer chips is a key recommendation in
the report.

Last week, President Biden urged Congress to pass those bills and
promised he would work to bring production of semiconductor chips back
to the United States.

"**[Today we barely produce 10 percent of the computer
chips]{.underline}**, despite being the leader in chip design and
research," Mr. Biden said. "And we don't have the ability to make the
most advanced chips now --- right now. **[But today, 75 percent of
production takes place in East Asia. Ninety percent of the most advanced
chips are made in Taiwan]{.underline}**. China is doing everything it
can to take over the global market so they can try to outcompete the
rest of us and have a lot of applications --- including military
applications."

**[[Even if Congress approves]{.mark} new government
[investments]{.mark} in America's microchip production capacities,
[matching Taiwanese expertise is years away]{.mark}]{.underline}**, if
it is even possible, the report's authors say. The United States is
already more dependent on Taiwan's high-end microchips than it was on
Middle Eastern oil in decades past, the report said.

**[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the war game predicts, **[[could
use]{.mark} economic coercion, cyberoperations and [hybrid tactics to
try to]{.mark} [seize or harm Taiwan's semiconductor
industry]{.mark}]{.underline}** --- **[and the United States must become
better able to identify and counter Chinese tactics that could threaten
the microchip supply.]{.underline}**

War games like this one involve current and former officials, academics
and other experts sitting around a table playing various roles. After an
initial scenario is presented, the teams take turns making strategic
decisions. Such exercises are supposed to yield insights about how
different players would act, and lay plain what sort of moves each group
might make.

Becca Wasser, who helped design and lead the scenario, said that while
many war games were conducted to study China, most focused on
conventional military threats, giving short shrift to the many ways
China could exert pressure on Taiwan.

And countering those pressure points could be difficult, especially if
the United States and Taiwan were at odds over the best strategy. In the
scenario, the U.S. team presumed the Taiwan team would go along with its
strategies to counter China. But Taiwan's interest sometimes led it to
cross-purposes. For example, when the United States wanted to bring
semiconductor engineers to the safety of America, Taiwan resisted,
worried about a brain drain.

"**[Whatever the United States tried to do by itself in the game really
fell flat]{.underline}**," Ms. Wasser said. "**[We have seen a variety
of examples of that in real life]{.underline}**."

**[As a result, multilateral responses and global efforts to build
resiliency in the supply chain for computer chips are most likely the
best strategy]{.underline}**, the report said.

**[[Taiwan has relied on its dominance of the microchip industry for its
defense]{.mark}. The "silicon shield" theory argued that because its
semiconductor industry is so important to Chinese
manufacturing]{.underline}** and the United States consumer economy,
actions that threaten its foundries would be too risky.

Martijn Rasser, a co-author of the study and a former C.I.A. analyst,
said it was crucial for the international community to convince Taiwan
that its shield strategy needed to be internationalized. "The long-term
play has to be a geographic dispersal of those capabilities out of
Taiwan in exchange for enhanced security guarantees for the island," he
said.

**[The Biden administration has made clear that [in the case of
Ukraine]{.mark}, while the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates would
economically punish Russia for any invasion, it [would not commit
troops]{.mark} to fight alongside Kyiv]{.underline}** to stop any
intervention by Moscow. The longstanding American policy toward Taiwan
calls for shoring up its defenses and practicing strategic ambiguity
over whether Washington would militarily intervene in a conflict over
the island.

**[But [Taiwan and its semiconductors are far more important to
America's economy]{.mark} than Ukraine is --- meaning it would very
likely be far more difficult for the United States to stay out of a
conflict involving Taiwan.]{.underline}**

Taiwan accounts for half of the overall production of microchips that
are critical to the functioning of mobile phones, consumer electronics,
cars, military equipment and more. South Korea, the nearest competitor,
has about 17 percent of the overall market. But Taiwanese chips are the
smallest and fastest, and its foundries account for 92 percent of the
most advanced designs.

"It's almost impossible to duplicate Taiwan's manufacturing capability
of high-end chips, of low-end chips," said Dan Blumenthal, a scholar at
the American Enterprise Institute. "It's just the manufacturing hub of
the world."

Although the United States and Europe are trying to boost their own
domestic design and production of semiconductors, they do not have the
abilities to mass produce the most advanced designs that the Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or TSMC, can make.

["**[If the semiconductor supply chain is infringed upon by
China]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[in some way, all of the [sudden the

Causes, Consequences, and Addressing the Challenges,"

**[Rising food prices contribute to [food insecurity]{.mark}, which [is
a]{.mark} clear and [serious threat to human security]{.mark}. Interest
in food security as a catalyst for political instability and
conflict]{.underline}** has grown rapidly since 2007--2008, when food
protests and riots broke out in 48 countries as a result of record world
prices. In February 2011, the food price index of the Food and
Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) reached a new
historic peak, and the rise in food prices contributed to the wave of
protests across North Africa and the Middle East that toppled Tunisian
president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali and Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak.

Among major development organizations, the unchallenged consensus is
that war and conflict are development issues: conflict ravages local
economies, often leading to forced migration, refugee populations,
disease, a collapse of social trust, and acute food insecurity. **[But
is food insecurity itself a cause of conflict?]{.underline}** Based on a
review of recent research, **[the answer is a highly qualified yes.
[Food insecurity]{.mark}]{.underline}**, especially **[when caused by
higher food prices, [heightens the risk of]{.mark}]{.underline}**
democratic breakdown, **[civil conflict]{.underline}**, protest,
rioting, **[and communal [conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The evidence
linking food insecurity to interstate conflict is less strong, though
there is some historical evidence linking declining agricultural yields
to periods of regional conflict in Europe and Asia.

These links are highly context-specific: they are contingent on existing
political institutions, levels of economic development, social safety
nets and demographic pressures. Food insecurity is neither a necessary
nor sufficient condition for acute political violence and conflict.
Generally, the risk of violent conflict is higher where political
regimes intermingle democratic and authoritarian institutions or when a
youth bulge, low levels of development, deteriorating economic
conditions, or high inequalities among groups are present.

**[[Fragile states]{.underline}]{.mark}** (which have a high share of
food imports), and the households within them (who must spend a large
share of their income on food), **[[are particularly vulnerable]{.mark}
to higher food prices]{.underline}**. Moreover, this vulnerability has
increased over time. On the other hand, violent conflicts have also
contributed to higher food prices and food insecurity, contributing to a
vicious cycle.

While the situation seems bleak, the contingent nature of food
insecurity's effect on conflict suggests that governments, international
organizations (IOs), and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) can take
positive steps to reduce food insecurity and break the relationship
between food insecurity and conflict. **[Governments can act to shield
their citizens from higher prices and volatility in world markets by
initiating measures to stabilize food prices and by establishing social
protection systems that mitigate the impact of high food prices on
vulnerable groups]{.underline}**. Unfortunately, **[the capacity of
fragile states to do that is limited.]{.underline}** The World Food
Programme and NGOs can assist in times of acute crisis to provide
relief. Finally, governments, IOs and NGOs can work to make food
security a part of the post-conflict peacebuilding and reconstruction
process. **[The challenges are great, but [the]{.mark} potential
[social, economic, and political costs of inaction are]{.mark} even
[great]{.mark}er]{.underline}**.

#### Rigorous [empirical]{.underline} studies prove [food insecurity]{.underline} causes [conflict]{.underline}.

https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12571-016-0610-x

What do these findings indicate about the variation in the risk of
conflict and civil conflict? Firstly, **[[all]{.mark} four [models
support]{.mark} the argument that [a significant relationship]{.mark}
exists [between food]{.mark} insecurity [and
conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}**. More specifically, these findings
suggest that, for an average country, the baseline risk of conflict and
civil conflict increases in regions that provide at least some access to
food -- supporting the expectation that global demands for food should
generally direct conflict towards agricultural areas. At the same time,
within agricultural areas, **[conflict is intuitively more likely to
arise in regions where the levels of food per capita are low -- that is,
where food supplies are scarce]{.underline}**. Secondly, and in line
with previous research (Burke et al. 2009; O'Loughlin et al. 2012;
Hsiang and Meng 2014; Hendrix and Salehyan 2012), warmer regions and
areas with lower precipitation were significantly more likely to
experience conflict. This supports the argument that food scarcity can
serve, to some extent, as a mediating factor for the effects of climate
variables, in addition to the independent impact of food insecurity
related concerns on conflict. Thirdly, as extant studies (e.g., Hegre
and Sambanis 2006) suggest, poorer regions are more likely to experience
conflict, as are more ethnically diverse regions, although it appears
that higher levels of democracy do not translate into more peace once
cell level characteristics are taken into account.3 Perhaps
unsurprisingly, regions with larger populations are more likely to
experience conflict, as are more rural regions, as some scholars have
argued (Fearon and Laitin 2003; Kalyvas 2006; Buhaug et al. 2009).

In sum, four models involving different explanatory variables have been
utilized to examine two conceptualizations of conflict as an outcome of
interest. The results strongly support extant arguments that access to
and availability of food are each associated with an increased
occurrence of armed conflict. **[This evidence does not negate previous
[explanations]{.mark} of conflict [that emphasize]{.mark} the importance
of [political and economic development]{.mark} or climactic variation.
However, by highlighting the strong association between food access and
availability on one hand, and local political violence on the other, the
above findings do show that these past expositions]{.underline}** (e.g.
Miguel et al. 2004; Burke et al. 2009; Hsiang and Meng 2014) **[in and
of themselves [are insufficient]{.mark} to fully explain the likelihood
of local level conflict]{.underline}**. Simply put, the present study
confirms that **[there exists a systematic, and global, relationship
between food insecurity]{.underline}** on one hand,
**[and]{.underline}** the occurrence and persistence of social
**[conflict]{.underline}** on the other.

Discussion

What do these findings imply about the effect of food insecurity and
conflict? Naturally, even the most detailed and elaborate models are
simplistic, especially when containing as diverse a range of
observations as those examined above. Nevertheless, **[in terms of
conditional probabilities, all [models show a]{.mark} statistically
significant first difference [change of]{.mark} approximately [+92 %
in]{.mark} the probability of [conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}** when a
high risk scenario is simulated for an average cell.4

The conditional probabilities discussed above highlight the inherent
complexity of social systems, as a phenomenon as notable as violent
conflict ultimately arises due to a variety of stressors. Therefore, it
should be emphasized that the above findings should not be interpreted
as explaining conflict onset. Conflict can erupt due to various
political (Buhaug 2010; Fearon and Laitin 2003) or economic (Hegre and
Sambanis 2006; Collier and Hoeffler 2005) reasons -- which may or may
not be related to food insecurity -- that are beyond the scope of this
paper. Rather, the present study more simply suggests that political
violence will have a higher likelihood of concentrating in regions that
(i) offer more access to food resources and (ii) face low levels of food
availability within areas that offer some access to food resources.

This study adopts an economic perspective on food security to explain
this variation in the concentration of social conflict. From the demand
side, violent conflict is most likely to revolve primarily around access
to food sources. **[When food insecurity produces higher [demands for
food]{.mark}, these demands will directly [compel groups]{.mark} and
individuals [to]{.mark} seek out and [fight over]{.mark} existing food
[resources]{.mark}, rather than leading these actors to pursue and fight
over geographic areas that lack any]{.underline}** (or have very little)
**[agricultural resources]{.underline}**. Thus, access to croplands and
food is a necessary condition for food insecurity-induced conflict,
which is confirmed in the cropland analyses presented here. From the
supply side, and within those areas that do already offer access to
agriculture and/or food, conflict is most likely to occur in regions
that offer lower levels of food availability, or insufficient food
supplies. This is because **[lower food availability]{.underline}** (or
supplies) in these contexts **[directly implies higher levels of
resource scarcity, which can engender social grievances, and ultimately,
social and political conflict]{.underline}** (Brinkman and Hendrix 2011;
Hendrix and Brinkman 2013). **[More broadly, several causal mechanisms
could plausibly link food security and social conflict]{.underline}**.

**[For one, conflict in regions with higher food access and lower
availability might arise as a principal outcome of food insecurity. This
approach is most directly in tune with the body of research concerned
with the resource scarcity-based security implications of climate change
(e.g. Miguel]{.underline}** et al. 2004; **[Burke]{.underline}** et al.
2009; **[O'Loughlin]{.underline}** et al. 2012), **[as well as with
broader studies of conflict dynamics and food security in both rural and
urban contexts (Brinkman and Hendrix]{.underline}** 2011; **[Hendrix and
Brinkman]{.underline}** 2013; **[Messer and Cohen]{.underline}** 2006).
From this perspective, individuals and **[groups actively
fight]{.underline}** with one another **[due to [food]{.mark}
insecurity-induced [grievances]{.mark}, which may [manifest in]{.mark}
groups' [attempts to overthrow]{.mark} existing [political
structures]{.mark}, or in these actors' efforts to more directly seize
and control available (but scarce) agricultural resources in an effort
to better guarantee long-term food security for their constituents. If
future global projections for population growth, consumption, and
climate change hold true, then these dynamics suggest that incidences of
violent conflict over food scarcity and food insecurity may increase as
individuals and groups fight over a continuously shrinking pool of
resources, including food]{.underline}**.

**[A second mechanism involves the existence of logistic support in
conflict-prone regions]{.underline}**, or lack thereof. Throughout
history and well into the nineteenth century, armies living off the land
have been a regular characteristic of warfare. The utilization of
motorized transport vehicles and airlifts has significantly reduced the
need of modern militaries to rely on local populations for support, at
least among modernized, highly technological militaries (Kress 2002,
12--13). However, given the bureaucratic and economic capabilities
required to maintain such systems, **[the majority of]{.underline}**
state and non-state **[armed groups]{.underline}** in the developing
world **[are]{.underline}** still **[unlikely to be supported by
well-developed logistic supply chains]{.underline}** (Henk and Rupiya
2001). Taking into account the consistent relationship between economic
welfare and conflict (Hegre and Sambanis 2006; Fearon and Laitin 2003),
**[unsupported warring groups on all sides of a conflict may move into
regions that offer more access to cropland in order to forage and
pillage to support themselves, which in turn produces higher incidences
of hostilities]{.underline}**, especially if there is not much food per
person available within these fertile regions. Hence, violent conflict
in this case is not the direct result of food insecurity, but rather is
shaped by food insecurity concerns. **[The identified
[relations]{.mark}hips between food security and conflict [are robust
across numerous]{.mark} alternative model [spec]{.mark}ification[s, and
imply an independent effect]{.mark} of food insecurity in shaping
conflict dynamics and conflict risk]{.underline}**. Especially when
considered alongside current, and projected, climatic and
political-economic conditions, this linkage suggests that **[[countries
could see]{.mark} an increase in localized [conflict worldwide
in]{.mark} the [coming years]{.mark}]{.underline}**. However, this
anticipated trend should be considered with caution for several key
reasons.

drifting freely in the Black Sea after breaking loose in a storm. **[The

### 2AC \-\-- Mine Risk High

#### Mines found as far as Mediterranean

**News 24 22**, 3/28/22, "Turkey and Romania find mines floating off
coast,"
<https://www.news24.com/news24/World/News/turkey-and-romania-find-mines-floating-off-coast-20220328>,
JH

**[[Turkey]{.mark} on Monday [said a]{.mark} second [mine]{.mark} which
could have come [from Ukraine was discovered]{.mark}]{.underline}** near
its coastline, while **[[Romania]{.mark} also [said a mine had been
found off]{.mark} its [Black Sea coast]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

**[Russia had warned more than a week ago that some aged mines that
Ukrainians had deployed in the Black Sea]{.underline}** against its
invading troops had become dislodged from their cables by storms and
could **[[drift]{.mark} as [far as]{.mark} the [Straits of Bosphorus and
the Mediterranean Sea]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}

On Monday, the Turkish defence ministry tweeted that \"**[a mine was
[detected]{.mark} off Igneada [near]{.mark} the [Bulgarian
border]{.mark}]{.underline}**\" on the Black Sea.

\"The mine has been secured**[\... and an intervention launched to
neutralise it]{.underline}**,\" it said.

Later, the ministry confirmed the device had been defused.

Also on Monday, Romanian authorities said another mine had been found 39
nautical miles (70-72 km) from the coastal town of Capul Midia.

According to the defence ministry, the device was spotted by a fishing
vessel on Monday morning and was then destroyed by a specialised
disposal squad.

A first mine was found on Saturday and defused by the Turkish navy,
after a fisherman had reported seeing it about two kilometres  off
Rumelifeneri, on the entrance of the Bosphorus north of Istanbul.

**[[Ankara]{.mark} has spoken to Ukrainian and Russian authorities [to
follow up \"coordination on this subject]{.mark},\" Turkey\'s defence
minister]{.underline}** said on Saturday.

In its warning on 19 March, **[Russia\'s FSB security service said that
\"dilapidated\" mines that Ukrainians had deployed]{.underline}**
against its forces had broken from their cables and were floating in the
Black Sea.

Several days ago, **[Turkish authorities warned on the NAVTEX maritime
alert system that there was a risk of mines floating from Ukrainian
waters]{.underline}** after being dislodged from their anchors by a
storm.

Underwater mines normally have to be equipped with systems that render
them harmless if they break free from their anchors.

**[But [older mines could lack]{.mark} this [safety measure]{.mark},
Turkish media reported.]{.underline}**

A rare interview with the **[leader of a Chinese unmanned-submarine
program]{.underline}** offers tantalizing new **[hints]{.underline}**
about the **[direction of China's artificial-intelligence and
naval-technology efforts]{.underline}** --- **[as well as]{.underline}**
Beijing's messaging and **[deterrence strategies.]{.underline}**

Lin Yang runs the 912 Project, a classified **[program]{.underline}** to
**[develop]{.underline}** **[new-generation military underwater
robots]{.underline}** by 2021. He told the South China Morning Post that
**[the]{.underline}** **[robot boats]{.underline}** are **[intended to
supplement the PLA Navy's manned subs]{.underline}** **[by handling such
tasks as]{.underline}** **[surveillance, minelaying, and even attacks on
enemy vessels]{.underline}**, **[relying on AI to adjust to changing
conditions.]{.underline}**

One close observer of China's military technology efforts found the
interview remarkable.

\"It is quite striking that a senior Chinese \[scientist\] is willing to
confirm the story and discuss a classified program, the 912 Project, in
an English-language publication," said Elsa B. Kania, adjunct fellow at
the Center for New American Security. "Presumably, that uncharacteristic
transparency reflects a recognition of the relevance of this disclosure
for signaling and deterrent purposes.\"

The researchers' **[statements on the new autonomous submarines
reflect]{.underline}** a **[recent push]{.underline}** by Chinese media
to **[highlight]{.underline}** **[naval innovation and
capabilities.]{.underline}** The China Daily reported that during a
naval inspection in Qingdao, China, in June, President
**[Xi]{.underline}** Jinping **[delivered a speech atop]{.underline}** a
**[new submarine recently shown]{.underline}** in a **[naval parade in
the S]{.underline}**outh **[C]{.underline}**hina **[S]{.underline}**ea.
He **[stressed the need "to grasp the changes of national security
circumstances, speed up preparations for military
struggle]{.underline}**, including **[battle planning, capacity building
and command system building."]{.underline}**

\"The PLA **[recognizes]{.underline}** a **[potential opportunity to
undermine current]{.underline}** **[U.S. dominance in undersea
warfare,"]{.underline}** Kania said. \"It is difficult to evaluate the
veracity of the story or the maturity of these efforts, so such accounts
should be assessed critically but taken seriously.\"

Last week, Chinese media reported the unveiling of new remote-controlled
undersea vehicles for "emergency rescue, marine salvage, and undersea
engineering projects," which it purported to be among the most advanced
of its kind. Similarly, Chinese media released plans for a
multi-functional rescue ship that will be commissioned in 2021 for use
in the South China Sea. The submarines, however, would be unique in
their use of artificial intelligence.

"The **[PLA is actively pursuing a range of AI-enabled
capabilities]{.underline}**, recognizing their potential to **[disrupt
the military balance in the Indo-Pacific and beyond,"]{.underline}**
Kania said. "In particular, **[the PLA is concentrating on naval
applications of AI]{.underline}**, including for decision support and in
increasingly autonomous vessels and submarines.\"

**[In early October, the US submarine USS Connecticut hit an \"uncharted
seamount\" underwater]{.underline}**, prompting an investigation leading
to the removal of the captain and two officers. However**[, this is not
the only incident involving US Navy vessel]{.underline}**s, **[which
only underscores issues such as operational demands in keeping up with
China\'s activities,]{.underline}** **[as well as the fact that the
South China Sea is]{.underline}** indeed **[becoming congested with
submarines]{.underline}**, **[with little communication between various
users]{.underline}**. ISEAS academic Ian Storey tells us more.

For the sailors aboard the US Navy's nuclear-powered submarine
USS Connecticut, the events of 2 October constitute every submariner's
worst nightmare.

On that day, the 9,000-tonne Seawolf-class fast-attack submarine struck
an undersea mountain (known as a seamount) hundreds of feet below the
pitch-black waters of the South China Sea.

Miraculously only 15 of the 116 crew members sustained injuries. The
vessel's bow was crumpled, but the hull was not breached, and the
nuclear reactor was undamaged.  The submarine was able to surface and
make its way to Guam under its own power. 

Two months on, the investigation into the **[crash]{.underline}** is
closed, the Connecticut has been patched up and will return to its home
port in Washington state to undergo further repairs.

While the incident may be over, it is worth looking at in closer detail,
for the causes, responses and implications **[highlight several
important issues]{.underline}** **[pertinent to the
ongoing]{.underline}** territorial, jurisdictional and **[geopolitical
dispute being played out in the heart of Southeast Asia.]{.underline}**

**[Accidents involving submarines are surprisingly
common]{.underline}**, with 37 over the past 20 years. **[Since the
advent of nuclear-powered submarines]{.underline}** in the 1950s, the US
Navy has lost two and Russia seven.

Let's start with the causes. A month after the accident, the US Navy
confirmed that the Connecticut had hit an \"uncharted seamount\" and not
another warship. Subsequently, **[the Navy concluded]{.underline}** that
the **[accident had been preventable]{.underline}**. The **[seamount was
uncharted because]{.underline}** the **[constant seismic activity along
the Asia-Pacific's \"Ring of Fire'\" occasionally throws up new
seamounts]{.underline}**. Nevertheless, the Navy sacked the captain and
two other senior officers because they had failed to follow proper
navigational procedures.

**[An almost identical incident]{.underline}** to the Connecticut
**[happened]{.underline}** in 2005 when the USS San Francisco, a Los
Angeles-class nuclear submarine, collided with a seamount at full tilt
**[near Guam]{.underline}**. On that occasion, the submarine was almost
lost; the front section of the submarine was severely damaged, one crew
member died, and 98 were injured. That both submarines survived is a
testament to the professionalism of the crew and the robust construction
of the vessels.

But the Connecticut accident deals another blow to the reputation of the
US Navy in Asian waters**[. In 2017, in separate incidents, two
destroyers, the]{.underline}** USS Fitzgerald and the USS John S.
McCain, **[collided with merchant ships]{.underline}** with the loss of
seven and ten sailors, respectively.

56) is towed away from the pier at Changi Naval Base, 5 October 2017.

These mishaps highlighted troubling leadership, training and maintenance
issues, exacerbated by the heavy operational demands placed on America's
Pacific Fleet as it struggles to keep pace with China's naval activities
in the region while at the same time maintaining a presence across the
Western Pacific. China's navy now has more battle force ships than its
US counterpart, operates shiny new warships (though perhaps not as
capable as US vessels) and can focus its activities on Northeast and
Southeast Asia.

**[China used the incident to strengthen its narrative that America's
military presence in the South China Sea undermines regional
stability]{.underline}**. China has been particularly vexed at US
military reconnaissance missions near its coast and bases in the Paracel
and Spratly Islands (the Connecticut was, according to one report, in
the vicinity of the Paracels when the accident happened).

The Global Times, the Chinese Communist Party-owned mouthpiece, even put
up an online petition calling for America to provide more information on
the accident, accusing it of a cover-up.

After the accident, Beijing called on the US to cease its military
activities in the South China Sea**[,]{.underline}** and claimed that
the presence of US submarines increased **[the risk of a collision or
nuclear accident]{.underline}** (it didn't mention that the PLA-Navy's
fleet of a dozen nuclear-powered submarines also operates in the area).
China also used the seamount accident to criticise the Australia-UK-US
(AUKUS) agreement which aims to supply Australia with eight
nuclear-powered subs.

Politicking aside, there **[are legitimate concerns about the potential
for a submarine accident in the South China Sea.]{.underline}**

**[In some areas, the waters are too shallow for submarines to operate,
but in other areas, there are deep trenches of the kind submarines love
to lurk in]{.underline}**. **[The problem is that]{.underline}** those
underwater **[troughs are becoming increasingly crowded with
submarines]{.underline}** from both regional and extra-regional states. 

Although **[submarines]{.underline}** are covered by the Code for
Unplanned Encounters at Sea (CUES) --- which is designed to prevent
dangerous incidents at sea from occurring --- they **[cannot
conduct]{.underline}** the type of **[signalling and
communications]{.underline}** surface warships can. Singapore has
advocated a code of conduct for submarines to supplement CUES, but given
the inherently clandestine nature of submarine operations, this is
almost certainly a non-starter. In 2009, a British and French submarine
bumped into each other in the North Atlantic. **[If close allies like
the UK and France can't communicate the positions of their submarines to
each other]{.underline}**, **[what hope is there in the contested waters
of the South China Sea?]{.underline}**

Moreover**[, as retired PLA Colonel Zhou Bo recently
argued]{.underline}**, **[given the growing mutual animosity and
mistrust between China and America, if an accident involving their
submarines were to occur]{.underline}**, **[de-escalating it would prove
far more challenging than previous Sino-US military
incidents]{.underline}**. It isn't reassuring that since President Biden
took office, the US and Chinese defence ministers haven't even spoken to
each other.

**[What are the pitfalls and blind spots that could result in a
multi-billion dollar submarine loaded with the most advanced sensors on
earth colliding with something underwater?]{.underline}**

**[Submarine navigation requires very detailed knowledge of the
immediate surrounding area]{.underline}**. There are two common methods
of achieving safe, submerged navigation: Detailed charts and active
high-frequency sonar employment. 

Highly accurate charts are always the first choice. Active sonar
transmissions are used to confirm the water depth checks with the chart.
These active sonar pulses can be transmitted in front and to the sides
of modern submarines. These short-range, high-frequency sonar systems
reveal nearby underwater objects with great clarity. Submerged objects,
such as mines, wrecks, and other submarines are [plainly visible to a
trained sonar
operator](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/35603/veteran-submariner-on-how-sonar-crews-tirelessly-hunt-enemies-they-cant-even-see). 

The downside to the use of active sonar is that it is detectable and at
approximately two times the range it allows the operator to search, in
most ocean environments. A typical high-frequency, high-resolution sonar
may see out to 5,000 yards and is vulnerable to detection out to least
10,000 yards or farther in good conditions. This means an adversary can
localize a submarine's position, and it can remain undetected [while
trailing](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/33090/how-american-and-allied-submarines-regularly-fight-to-the-death-off-the-bahamas) the
active-sonar emitting submarine for as long as it uses its
high-resolution sonar.

This vulnerability to detection is why active sonar is rarely used. If
bottom-mapping sonars verify the submarine\'s position on the chart,
there is less need to use a high-frequency, forward-looking sonar that
may reveal your position.

U.S. Navy charts [are the most accurate
charts](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/31838/heres-the-story-behind-that-mysterious-navy-cube-croatian-fishermen-pulled-from-the-sea) in
use today. They are digital (with paper backups), which allows them to
be updated more frequently. Ideally, every sub in the U.S. Navy has the
most recent chart that accurately reflects reality outside the hull. In
practice, we have found that this is not always the case. Some areas of
the world have tens of yards between soundings, these blind spots may
hide topographical formations that rise up from the bottom into a
submarine's operating envelope.

**[If a submarine is operating in an area where they suspect the
presence of adversary submarines, they may choose to not use
high-frequency active sonar]{.underline}** to verify surrounding
topography. This, as described earlier, is **[because]{.underline}** the
sonar **[transmissions will give away their position if
detected]{.underline}**. **[This means the submarine relies on
accelerometer dead-reckoning for the ship's position.  ]{.underline}**

**[This type of navigation has]{.underline}** very **[small errors that
compound over time]{.underline}**. **[Eventually, the submarine
can]{.underline}** **[be]{.underline}** **[out of position by hundreds
of yards or more]{.underline}**. **[The error grows with
time]{.underline}** until the next navigational fix. There are ways to
fix the submarine\'s position that doesn't involve sonar, but they
don\'t reveal what topography is hidden between soundings on a chart.

How can other submarines and the emergence of unmanned underwater
vehicles be a factor?

**[Collision with manned submarines in the South China Sea is a very
real concern]{.underline}**. **[The body of water is bordered by many
nations]{.underline}** **[that operate conventional]{.underline}**
**[and nuclear-powered submarines]{.underline}**. **[China operates the
largest submarine base]{.underline}** in Asia, [Yulin Naval
Base](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/35837/image-shows-chinese-submarine-entering-mysterious-cave-facility-at-south-china-sea-base)**[,
in the South China Sea]{.underline}**. **[At any time, there could be
multiple submarines operating in the area. ]{.underline}**

Cooperative nations like Australia and Vietnam work with allies to
manage water space and avoid collisions. This helps mitigate the risk of
collision. Other **[countries that do not deconflict submarine
operations]{.underline}** **[pose a real risk to]{.underline}**
themselves and other **[submarines]{.underline}**.

**[The risk of submarine collision in the South China Sea]{.underline}**
**[is more likely than in other areas of the world]{.underline}**
**[because it's a very busy area for]{.underline}** vessels of all
types, including **[submarines]{.underline}**. The **[increased activity
makes passive sonar less effective.]{.underline}**
**[Submarines]{.underline}** can, and will, **[hide in noisy areas to
mask their passive broadband signature]{.underline}** with background
noise. The means **[[two submarines may
pass](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/33018/modern-submarine-torpedo-attacks-are-nothing-like-what-you-see-in-the-movies) very
close to each other, and neither will hear the other]{.underline}**, if
background noise is loud enough to mask both submarines.

[**[Unmanned underwater
vehicles]{.underline}**](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/38443/snakehead-will-be-the-largest-underwater-drone-that-u-s-nuclear-submarines-can-deploy) are **[[changing

UUVs [can operate in very
shallow](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/37713/check-out-these-navy-special-operators-deploying-an-underwater-scout-drone) or [restricted

a **[nuclear submarine]{.underline}** would not be able to. UUVs
**[use]{.underline}** a combination of **[[sonars and artificial

with less risk]{.underline}** to human life. If a UUV runs aground, it
doesn't risk damaging a nuclear reactor or injuring crewmen because it
has neither. This capability has put UUVs in high demand and [employed
by many
navies](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/14733/the-us-navy-has-created-its-first-ever-underwater-drone-squadron) around
the globe.

The South China Sea is supposedly very challenging to navigate for
submarines in some areas, especially large types. Is its unique
underwater 'littoral' topography a major issue?

**[The topography of the South China Sea is very difficult to navigate
because of]{.underline}** its **[high tectonic activity.]{.underline}**
**[The bottom is in]{.underline}** a **[constant]{.underline}** **[state
of change]{.underline}**. **[Some areas]{.underline}** of the South
China Sea **[are very deep, with]{.underline}** **[sudden
changes]{.underline}** in depth **[to very shallow]{.underline}**, near
vertical-like structures that can rise to the surface. 

These **[pinnacles are navigation hazards]{.underline}**
**[and]{.underline}**, if not detected in time, **[may result in a
submerged collision]{.underline}**. Measuring bottom depth below the
submarine may not give it enough time to maneuver out of the way of a
near-vertical topographical change just ahead.

military muscles]{.underline}** as Chinese military bosses declared "war
between the US and China is now reality". [**Warships, missiles, and
nuclear-capable bombers are flooding the region as both superpowers
prepare for a potentially nuclear conflict.** **The cradle of this war
zone is the South China Sea which Beijing claim belongs to the Chinese
by right while the US weighs in support of the Asian power's Pacific
neighbours**]{.underline}. Experts have warned **[just one wrong move
could cause the region to explode into war between the US and
China]{.underline}**. Daily Star Online can now reveal just how close
the world is to war **[igniting]{.underline}** between the US and China
and **[the start of World War 3]{.underline}**. David L. Goldwyn, a
former special envoy for the US State Department, warned of conflict
with China in a report to the Atlantic Council seen by Daily Star
Online. He said: \"China is prone to testing new US presidents and Mr.
Trump seems intent on testing, if not provoking, China. **[\"A
miscalculation on either side creates a non-negligible risk of military
conflict."]{.underline}** Defiant **[Beijing have been continuing to
expand into the disputed waters as they claim islands and sandbars to
build giant defensive bases packed with missiles and designed to launch
warplanes]{.underline}**. The Communist giant claims the seas flanked by
nations such as the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia due to its strategic
importance -- offering access from the Indian Ocean to the Pacific. Half
of the world's merchant ships pass through the disputed waters, and
China is staking its claim as part of the brewing trade war with the US.
It is also believed the sea is rich in oil and natural gas, according to
studies by the Department of the Environment and Natural Resources.
China understands the power which can be seized by claiming the sea, and
packing the region with weapons including nuclear submarines base in
Hainan. The superpower has also deployed its aircraft carrier, and
announced their second will be stationed in the swirling conflict
cauldron. Meanwhile, **[the US is expanding its reach as it places
nuclear-capable bombers in]{.underline}** their bases in
**[Guam]{.underline}**, fighter jets and marines in **[Japan,
and]{.underline}** missile systems in **[South Korea]{.underline}**.

surrounding China in a pincer movement designed to provoke Beijing. War

#### And, Sub bumping causes US/China and China/Japan war---rallies nationalism and miscalculation

**Farley, 15** (Robert, assistant professor at the Patterson School of
Diplomacy and International Commerce, "3 ways China and the US could go
to war in the South China Sea," The National Interest, 6-6-15,
http://nationalinterest.org/feature/3-ways-china-the-us-could-go-war-the-south-china-sea-13055)

In the Cold War, the Soviet Union and NATO suffered innumerable
submarine "near misses," as boats hunted each other, and occasionally
bumped each other, in the Atlantic, the Arctic, and the North Sea. The
dynamics of U.S.-Chinese sub interaction hasn't yet played out in quite
the same way, in part because China has yet to establish a sustained
SSBN patrol, and in part because Chinese boats do not range as far as
their Soviet counterparts. But **[as the submarine force of the PLAN
becomes more adventurous, submarine incidents may
increase.¶]{.underline}** Many **[analysts are arguing that the PLAN
needs to push its submarines past the first island chain in order to
seriously threaten U.S. access to China's littoral]{.underline}**.
Preparing for **[this would require increasing the tempo of the PLAN's
submarine operations, which would more often put China's boats in
proximity with Japanese and American subs.]{.underline}** To be sure,
Chinese submarines are loud enough that U.S. boats should have plenty of
time to get out of their way, but the same could be said of Soviet boats
for much of the Co ld War.¶ If **[a major submarine
incident]{.underline}** happened between the United States and China,
the nature of the medium might offer some hope for de-escalation (we
often don't hear about these accidents until much later). But such an
incident **[would]{.underline}** also **[put more lives and property at
stake than a fighter collision.¶ Accidental war is rare, but not
impossible. Common to all of these scenarios is the potential that
Chinese]{.underline}** (**[or]{.underline}** less likely,
**[American]{.underline}**) public **[opinion might become so inflamed
as to box in policymakers.]{.underline}** **[If Xi]{.underline}**
Jinping, who has made assertive foreign policy a cornerstone of his
administration, **[feels that he cannot back down and survive
politically, then things could get unpredictable very
quickly.]{.underline}**

#### That war goes nuclear.

**[There is no guarantee]{.underline}** that **[China and Japan will be
able to keep]{.underline}** their **[bilateral military interactions in
the E]{.underline}**ast **[C]{.underline}**hina **[S]{.underline}**ea
**[below the threshold of armed violence]{.underline}**, even if it is
their continuing preferences to do so. This event would not necessarily
ruin Asia's long record for the avoidance of major interstate wars. The
downing of a plane or the sinking of a coastguard vessel would not
automatically spell the beginning of a catastrophic conflict. But
**[Asia's]{.underline}** relative **[peace has induced a tendency to
assume that war]{.underline}** of almost any sort **[is]{.underline}**
largely **[unthinkable because it would be so costly]{.underline}**,
including for economic reasons. **[It is important to
question]{.underline}** any **[prevailing assumptions that this logic
will remain robust in a serious Sino-Japanese crisis]{.underline}**
which could well be just around the corner.¶ There may also be a
corresponding assumption that Japan would not be the first to use force
because of long-standing constitutional and moral restraints. Again this
should be questioned. Some years back, when the transformation of the
Japanese Coastguard (JCG) was already becoming evident, Richard Samuels
observed that in contrast to the Maritime Self Defense Force (which 'is
denied authority to fire on enemy ships unless fired on first') the JCG
'is now allowed by law to initiate armed conflict under conditions that
are vaguely defined and easily justifiable in retrospect. Local
commanders are now authorised to use force under the conditions of
"justifiable defense" and during an "emergency."' 2 M. Taylor Fravel has
argued that China tends to restrict its use of force in territorial
disputes to situations when its claim is weak.3 But this limitation is
of little comfort whenever the Senkaku/Diaoyu dispute is seen as one of
those weaker claims. ¶ Should minor hostilities eventuate, either
accidentally or by design, a good deal would then depend on the
political temperature of the Sino-Japanese relationship. In the event of
any public coverage, **[nationalist sentiment in both countries would
likely put both governments in a difficult position, even if restraint
was their preferred option]{.underline}**. **[The paucity of ongoing
political contact between China and Japan at the highest
level]{.underline}** (in contrast to Sino-US relations under Xi and
Obama) **[might make an agreement on restraint harder to
agree]{.underline}**, as would the absence of the maritime
communications mechanism that the two countries are currently
discussing. There is little sign that Sino-Japanese strategic relations
constitute what Coral Bell once called an adverse partnership which the
Cold War superpowers had already begun to develop by the time they found
themselves in the Cuban Missile Crisis. The absence of a similar
mutually chastening experience is probably one reason **[today's North
Asia lacks a 'consciousness between the dominant powers]{.underline}**,
that they have solid common interests as well as sharp conflicting
interests.'4¶ Something Small May Escalate Very Quickly¶ Whatever the
evolving atmospherics of the Xi-Abe relationship, it is difficult to
avoid the view that **[Japan and China are locked in]{.underline}** one
of Asia's closest approximations to **[a zero-sum-game over status and
prestige]{.underline}**. An ascendant China is bad for Japan's status
and a more vital Japan is a direct challenge to China's aspirations.
**[These dynamics play out in their E]{.underline}**ast
**[C]{.underline}**hina **[S]{.underline}**ea **[contest]{.underline}**.
And even if an improved political environment in North Asia can be
reached with more amicable Japan-China relations, **[perverse
military-technical incentives for the rapid escalation of conflict
could]{.underline}** still **[be viciously destabilising in the event of
even a minor outbreak of violence]{.underline}**. ¶ Perhaps the most
pernicious of these escalatory dynamics is the duality of China's
strategic predicament. On the one hand China's growing assertiveness in
the East China Sea is a sign of greater national confidence that the
People's Republic now has the power to revise the regional conditions
that it has hitherto had to put up with. On the other hand, China's
growing military presence in Asia's maritime theatres is the visible tip
of a military iceberg characterised by severe vulnerabilities in
C4SIR---Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence,
Surveillance and Reconnaissance--- and inexperience in operating
effectively beyond the first island chain. **[If Beijing
thought]{.underline}** for some reason, rightly or wrongly, that a more
**[significant use of force against the PLA by Japan was
imminent]{.underline}**, the **[pressures to preempt by way of China's
own escalation would be very significant]{.underline}**. If Japan's
knowledge of China's military weaknesses were accompanied by a Chinese
underestimation of Japan's surveillance power, any hint of Chinese
breakout could be a very hazardous moment in their strategic
relationship. In an excellent study, Avery Goldstein has pointed to the
real dangers of crisis instability between the China and the United
States.5 But more scholarly and official attention needs to be directed
to crisis instability problems between China and Japan.¶ Of course it
cannot be expected that any such escalating Sino-Japanese conflict will
necessarily remain between the two of them. **[The U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates, Japan's alliance guarantor,
**[will]{.underline}** likely **[face]{.underline}** some very **[early
decision points about whether to enter the fray]{.underline}**. In some
senses at least, a degree of **[American involvement
seems]{.underline}** almost **[automatic]{.underline}**. There are
intimate links between Japan's and America's armed forces and C4SIR
systems in North Asia, including their cooperation in underwater Sound
Surveillance Systems (SOSUS) facilities.6 **[It is difficult to imagine
Washington having anything less than a front seat in the evolving
violent drama. This raises the costs of China's escalation in a way that
might first be thought to generate great caution]{.underline}** in
Beijing; for the disablement of Japanese systems is also likely to
impinge on America's military eyes and ears in Asia.¶ China would need
to think twice about escalating a bilateral conflict with Japan because
of the distinct possibility of direct US military involvement.
**[But]{.underline}** knowing the resources that Japan's ally could
bring to bear, **[China could]{.underline}** in fact **[face incentives
to escalate very quickly]{.underline}** against Japan **[before America
made that fateful decision]{.underline}**. And if for some reason
Beijing believed that the United States was unlikely to come good on its
confirmation that the Mutual Security Treaty applies to Japan in the
context of Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands, the deterrence of Chinese escalation
could in fact be weakened. There is at least some speculation that China
might exploit an emerging crisis with Japan in an attempt to force the
United States to blink.7 ¶ Beijing could well be uncertain about what
Washington would do. But in the pressure and confusion of an already
serious crisis, China's leaders only need to think that American
involvement is a possibility to face some additional escalatory
pressures. The PLA would be operating in the knowledge that its
vulnerable C4SIR systems would be among the very first targets of
American military action to defend its alliance partner. China would
therefore face at least two types of escalatory pressures. The first one
is more general: to use what forces it has available over which it may
lose effective command should its control systems be disabled. In this
way the possibility of American involvement may, through China's
preemptive moves, become an absolute certainty. The second pressure is
more specific: China would find it too tempting not to target American
C4SIR systems including America's satellite capabilities. ¶ A Nuclear
Exchange is Also Possible¶ In this sequence, **[the move from a
small]{.underline}** and even accidental **[use of force]{.underline}**
involving China and Japan **[to a much more]{.underline}** serious and
**[damaging triangular conflict with U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[participation]{.underline}** suddenly
**[seems plausible]{.underline}**. By no means is it too much to imagine
**[China's early resort to
a]{.underline}**nti-**[sat]{.underline}**ellite
**[attacks]{.underline}**, its exploitation of asymmetric advantages
with **[its]{.underline}** growing missile **[capabilities to target
America's]{.underline}** aircraft **[carriers, and an acceleration in
Chinese cyber-attacks]{.underline}** for military purposes. Nor in
response, or in anticipation, is it implausible to envision devastating
American and Japanese attacks against China's C4SIR and missile systems.
All three parties would very likely be aiming to keep this escalating
exchange in the conventional domain (and only two of them have nuclear
weapons that might be used). But there are **[strategic and material
factors]{.underline}** which **[suggest]{.underline}** that **[nuclear
escalation is less unlikely than some]{.underline}** might wish to
**[presume]{.underline}**.¶ An outwardly confident but inwardly
vulnerable China may resort to nuclear threats against Japan as a form
of intimidation. That would immediately require America's closest
attention. Nuclear weapons remain for China the great equaliser. But
this also means that as prized assets, **[China may]{.underline}** want
to **[use its nuclear weapons early]{.underline}** if it feels that its
ability to retain the capacity to do so is at risk. Two material issues
surface here to make this hugely destabilising situation possible. The
first is that **[China lacks separate tactical and strategic
C4SIR]{.underline}** systems. This raises the prospect that American
(and Japanese) conventional attacks designed to degrade China's control
of its conventional forces may also reduce Beijing's confidence in its
ability to retain a nuclear deterrence capability. China may face a
horrible dilemma such that if it wants to retain a nuclear option, it
has to use it early rather than as a last resort. The second is that,
because of basing arrangements, **[China may assume that an American
conventional attack will also remove some of its land based nuclear
missiles]{.underline}** and sea based nuclear systems. **[This
is]{.underline}** also **[a perverse incentive to nuclear
escalation]{.underline}**.

#### And, SSBN [escalation]{.underline} AND [bumping accidents]{.underline} with the U.S. and Russia are [under-estimated]{.underline} but a [greater risk]{.underline} than [any other weapon]{.underline}

Against this desperate tactic, even the US had no effective
countermeasure. The problem it presented to strategic stability was that
**[it brought Soviet sub]{.underline}**marine**[s even closer to
American anti-sub]{.underline}**marine **[forces]{.underline}** than
**[when they hid mid-ocean or under the umbrella of their own
anti-submarine forces close to home, implying]{.underline}** that
**[they had to fire first]{.underline}** in a crisis **[to be sure of
annihilating]{.underline}** the **[American leadership]{.underline}** as
a way **[to disable US nuclear forces and]{.underline}** thereby
**[limit]{.underline}** the **[damage]{.underline}** to the USSR
**[from]{.underline}** a **[perceived, pending American first
strike.]{.underline}** And **[for the US, it suggested]{.underline}**
that **[these sub]{.underline}**marine**[s]{.underline}** **[should be
attacked early in]{.underline}** a **[crisis]{.underline}**,
**[before]{.underline}** **[even one Soviet missile was fired from a
sub]{.underline}**marine, **[a step that could accelerate escalation
even if Soviet intentions had actually been only to
threaten]{.underline}** nuclear attack, **[not]{.underline}** to
**[actually use nuc]{.underline}**lear weapon**[s]{.underline}**.

**[From being the most secure]{.underline}**, lost in the deep ocean,
and therefore the ultimate and **[unassailable second
strike]{.underline}** force that could and would retaliate, no matter
what happened to the homeland, **[sub]{.underline}**marine **[nuclear
forces and their antithesis became the most provocative weapons of all.
These forces were no longer the ultimate guarantor of "strategic
stability," better called the balance of terror, instead they were less
controllable due to distance and communications difficulties and more
prone to pre-delegation of nuclear-use authority in case]{.underline}**
the **[home national command disappeared off the periscope, possibly
literally. Their weapons]{.underline}** were now **[the most rapidly
deliverable even compared to missiles or forward-deployed fighter
bombers in Alaska, Europe and East Asian bases in Japan,
Korea]{.underline}** and **[Guam.]{.underline}**

Indeed, it is now known that **[a Soviet sub]{.underline}**marine
**[nearly fired nuclear weapons]{.underline}** at US warships **[at the
height of the]{.underline}** 1962 **[Cuban missile
crisis]{.underline}**; and as part of that confrontation, the Soviets
had dispatched a nuclear missile-firing submarine to stand off Honolulu,
ready to nuke it if the situation had escalated. And, off the beaches
and ports, **[superpower submariners engaged in cat-and-mouse games,
sometimes even colliding]{.underline}** with each other. **[American
sub]{.underline}**marine**[s]{.underline}** also **[tapped
into]{.underline}** Soviet submarine communication **[cables in the Sea
of Okhotsk to secure]{.underline}** fantastic quantities of
**[communications data]{.underline}** for the US,
**[operating]{.underline}** even **[inside Soviet]{.underline}**
territorial **[waters. Enormous risks were taken]{.underline}**, which
only came to light in subsequent decades as submariners recounted their
experiences.

Post-Cold War submarine proliferation

When the Soviet Union collapsed, on the surface it looked like the
superpower submarine competition was over. The now-Russian submarine
fleet in the Pacific (and Atlantic) was moored in port. Some subs sank
at the dock, reactors and all; others caught on fire. **[For a decade,
no-one paid much attention]{.underline}** to what was going on
**[under]{.underline}** the **[water]{.underline}**, offshore **[in the
Pacific.]{.underline}**

**[In reality, the submarine game never stopped.]{.underline}**
**[Competition resumed]{.underline}** in the early 2000s
**[between]{.underline}** the **[US and Russian strategic nuclear
submarines and their respective anti-submarine forces]{.underline}**.
China, India, and Pakistan have all put nuclear missile-firing
submarines to sea or begun to test them seriously. Even North Korea
tested submarine-launched missiles and declared its intention to emulate
the superpowers.

with our common future."
http://www.wagingpeace.org/denuclearization-of-the-oceans-linking-our-common-heritage-with-our-common-future/

**[Accidents aboard nuclear submarines have caused a number of them to
sink with long-term adverse environmental consequences for the
oceans]{.underline}**. In addition to accidents, many countries have
purposefully dumped radioactive wastes in the oceans. With regard to
proper stewardship of the planet, it is time to raise the issue of
denuclearizing the world's oceans. To fail to raise the issue and to
achieve the denuclearization of the oceans is to abdicate our
responsibility for the health and well-being of the oceans and the
planet. Nuclearization of the Oceans Nuclearization of the oceans has
taken a variety of forms. The primary ones are: 1. the oceans have
served as a medium for hiding nuclear deterrent forces located on
submarines; 2. **[nuclear reactors have been used to power ships,
primarily submarines, some of which have gone down at sea with their
nuclear fuel and nuclear weapons aboard]{.underline}**; 3. increasing
use is being made of the oceans for the transportation of nuclear wastes
and reprocessed nuclear fuels; 4. the oceans have been used as a dumping
ground for nuclear wastes; 5. atmospheric nuclear weapons testing,
particularly in the Pacific, has been a source of nuclear pollution to
the oceans as well as the land; and 6. underground nuclear weapons
testing, such as that conducted by France in the South Pacific, has
endangered fragile Pacific atolls and caused actual nuclear
contamination to the oceans as well as risking a much greater
contamination should the atolls crack due to testing or future
geological activity. The problems arising from nuclearization of the
oceans can be viewed from several perspectives. From an environmental
perspective, **[issues arise with regard to nuclear contamination in the
oceans working its way up through the food chain. The biological
resources of the oceans will eventually affect human
populations]{.underline}** which are reliant upon these resources. The
threat of nuclear contamination has diminished with regard to nuclear
testing, which has not taken place in the atmosphere since 1980.
Moreover, the nuclear weapons states have committed themselves to a
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which they have promised to conclude by
1996. This treaty, if concluded, will end all underground nuclear
testing. The dumping of high-level radioactive waste material was
curtailed by the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by the
Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter, which entered into force in 1975. A
later amendment to this Convention prohibited ocean dumping of all
radioactive wastes or other radioactive matter. However, exemptions
authorized by the International Atomic Energy Agency and non-compliance
remain a concern. **[Problems can be anticipated in the future when
radioactive contaminants]{.underline}** already dumped in canisters or
**[contained in fuel or weapons aboard sunken submarines breach their
containment]{.underline}**. Increased use of the oceans to transport
nuclear wastes and reprocessed nuclear fuel (between Japan and France,
for example) has substantially increased the risk of contamination.
Coastal and island states that are on the route of the transportation of
nuclear materials stand **[high risks of contamination in the event of
an accident at sea]{.underline}**. International law regarding the
transportation of hazardous material must be strengthened and strictly
enforced by the international community to prevent **[catastrophic
accidents]{.underline}** in the future. From a human rights perspective,
inhabitants of island states in the Pacific have suffered serious health
effects and dislocation as a result of atmospheric and underground
nuclear weapons testing. In response to assurances by France that their
underground testing in the South Pacific is entirely safe, the islanders
in Polynesia and throughout the Pacific have retorted: If it is so safe,
why isn't it being done in France itself? The response of the French
government has been that French Polynesia is French territory,
highlighting the arrogance and abuse that accompanies colonialism. Human
rights issues also arise with regard to maintaining a nuclear deterrent
force that threatens the annihilation of much of humanity. The Human
Rights Committee stated in November 1984 in their general comments on
Article 6 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,
i.e., the right to life, that "the production, testing, possession,
deployment and use of nuclear weapons should be prohibited and
recognized as crimes against humanity." The deployment of nuclear
weapons on submarines, therefore, arguably constitutes a crime against
humanity, and thus a violation of the most fundamental human right, the
right to life. From a security perspective, the nuclear weapons states
argue that having a submarine-based deterrent force assures their
security. Thus, to varying degrees, each of the nuclear weapons states
maintains strategic submarines capable of causing unthinkable
destruction if their missiles were ever launched. (See Appendix.) Viewed
from the self-interests of nearly all the world's population-except the
nuclear weapons states whose leaders appear addicted to maintaining
their nuclear arsenals -the continued reliance on nuclear deterrence, at
sea or on land, poses a frightening threat to continued human existence.
In 1972 the Seabed Agreement prohibited the emplacement of nuclear
weapons on the seabed, ocean floor, or subsoil thereof. This agreement
prohibited what was already deemed unnecessary by the nuclear weapons
states; placing nuclear weapons on submarines made them less vulnerable
to detection and destruction than placing them on or beneath the seabed
or ocean floor. The oceans continue to be used by the nuclear weapons
states as an underwater shadow world for their missile carrying
submarines. The United States alone currently has 16 Trident submarines,
each carrying some 100 independently targeted nuclear warheads. Each
Trident submarine has a total explosive force greater than all the
explosive force used in World War II, including at Hiroshima and
Nagasaki. Britain, with the help of the United States, is replacing its
older class of Polaris SSBNs with a fleet of four Trident submarines.
France currently has five strategic missile submarines with four more of
a superior class to be commissioned by 2005. Russia has over 35
strategic missile submarines with an estimated capacity of 2,350 nuclear
warheads. China has two modern ballistic missile submarines. Its Xia
class submarine carries twelve 200 kiloton nuclear warheads. The total
destructive force that day and night lurks beneath the oceans is a
chilling reminder of our technological capacity to destroy ourselves.
That this threat was created and is maintained in the name of national
security suggests a collective madness that must be opposed and overcome
if, for no other reason, we are to fulfill our obligation to posterity
to preserve human life. An ongoing responsibility resides with the
nuclear weapons states to fulfill the obligations set forth in Article
VI of the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), "to pursue negotiations in
good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear
arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament, and on a treaty
on general and complete disarmament under strict and effective
international control." At the NPT Review and Extension Conference in
April and May 1995, the treaty was extended indefinitely after extensive
lobbying by the nuclear weapons states. At the same time the nuclear
weapons states promised to enter into a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty by
1996, and to engage in a "determined pursuit" of the ultimate
elimination of their nuclear arsenals. Protecting the Common Heritage
The Law of the Sea Treaty enshrines the concept of the oceans as the
common heritage of \[hu\]mankind. Maintaining the oceans as a common
heritage **[demands that the oceans be protected from contamination by
nuclear pollutants]{.underline}**; that they not be used in a manner to
undermine basic human rights, particularly the rights to life and to a
healthy environment; and that the oceans not be allowed to serve as a
public preserve for those states that believe their own security
interests demand **[the endangerment of global human
survival]{.underline}**.

I lived most of my adult life during the Cold War, and, throughout, I
never lost sight of one overwhelming reality --- at any time, **[the
Cold War could turn hot, resulting in the extinction of our
civilization]{.underline}**. Now, inexplicably, we are recreating many
of the conditions of the Cold War. In fact, **[I believe that, today,
the likelihood of a nuclear catastrophe is actually greater than it was
during the Cold War.]{.underline}** The **[relations]{.underline}**
**[between the United States and Russia are as hostile as they were
during the]{.underline}** **[Cold War.]{.underline}** [**Russia has
dropped its long-term policy of \"N**o **F**irst **U**se\" of nuclear
weapons]{.underline} **[and is rebuilding its nuclear arsenal. It is
threatening its neighbors with these deadly weapons and indirectly
threatening the U.S.]{.underline}** Responding to this challenge, **[the
U.S. has begun rebuilding its nuclear arsenal. We seem determined to
replay the Cold War arms race]{.underline}**, with costs estimated at
more than \$1 trillion **[--- with predictably terrible
dangers.]{.underline}** Have we simply forgotten the immense dangers of
the Cold War? **[Several times during the Cold War, we faced the
prospect of a nuclear war by miscalculation]{.underline}**, most
dramatically during the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962. After that crisis,
President Kennedy said that he believed we had a one-in-three chance of
nuclear war. But Kennedy did not know --- which we now know --- that the
Soviet Union had already placed tactical nuclear weapons on the island
that were fully operational. If Kennedy had accepted the unanimous
recommendation of his Joint Chiefs of Staff to invade Cuba, our troops
would have been decimated on the beachheads by tactical nuclear weapons
and a general nuclear war would surely have followed. **[The
miscalculations of Soviet and U.S. leaders almost subjected the world to
a nuclear holocaust]{.underline}**. I believe **[we avoided that
catastrophe as much by good luck as by good management]{.underline}**.
[**Today, because of the ongoing hostility between the U.S. and Russia,
we are recreating the conditions that could lead to a nuclear war by
miscalc**ulation**. A higher risk is that of an accidental nuclear
war**]{.underline}. **[Because of our]{.underline}** \"**[Launch on
Warning\" policy]{.underline}**, **[a nuclear war could result by
accident if our missile attack warning system experienced a false
alarm]{.underline}**. **[During the Cold War, there were three such
false alarms]{.underline}** in the U.S. and two that we know about in
the Soviet Union. In 1979, I personally experienced one of the false
alarms in the U.S., and it changed forever my way of thinking about
nuclear dangers. I was awoken at 3 a.m. by the watch officer at the
North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) saying that the
computer was showing 200 intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) on
the way from the Soviet Union to the United States. We were spared a
disaster because the watch officer correctly concluded that the computer
was giving a false reading --- as it turns out, due to human error. But
what if that false alarm had occurred during the Cuban Missile Crisis?
In that context, the watch officer surely would have passed the alarm on
to the president, who, after being awoken at 3 a.m., would have had less
than 10 minutes to decide whether to launch our ICBMs before they were
destroyed in their silos. Humans will err again. Machines will
malfunction again. **[Today, just as in the Cold War, we face the
possibility of an accidental war destroying our
civilization]{.underline}**. Besides the return of those Cold War
dangers, we now have two new dangers: the possibility of a regional
nuclear war or a nuclear attack by a terror group.

### 2AC \-\-- Risk of Accidents High

The **[unexpected appearance of an alleged Chinese submarine
in]{.underline}** the **[Taiwan Strait]{.underline}** this week has
**[highlighted the dangers posed by the frequent presence of military
vessels in the narrow waterway]{.underline}**, **[which analysts warn
could ultimately spark an unintended conflict.]{.underline}** Writing on
the Covert Shores blog Monday, submarine expert H.I. Sutton identified
the vessel as a Chinese Type-94 nuclear-powered ballistic missile sub in
a photo from the open source European satellite imagery service,
Sentinel-2. **[The sub was spotted allegedly cruising above the surface
of the waters separating Taiwan from mainland China]{.underline}**,
**[where many analysts say conflict is more likely to start from an
accidental collision than a planned event]{.underline}** \-- **[and the
more warships in a confined space]{.underline}**, **[the more chances
there are for accidents to happen]{.underline}**. The reason for its
alleged presence in the strait is unknown, but Sutton said it was likely
**[the Chinese sub \-- also known as an SSBN or boomer \-- was on a
routine mission]{.underline}**, possibly heading back to a People\'s
Liberation Army (PLA) Navy port on the Bohai Sea for repairs or
maintenance. But other experts who viewed the satellite image said the
alleged presence of a boomer on the surface was perplexing. \"An SSBN on
the surface is all but unheard of,\" said Carl Schuster, an ex-US Navy
captain and former director of operations at the US Pacific Command\'s
Joint Intelligence Center. \"This may suggest a hull or engineering
problem that requires a major shipyard to investigate and fix.\" The
Taiwan Strait is just 110 miles (180 kilometers) across at its narrowest
point. It has become one of the world\'s military hotspots as China puts
increasing pressure on self-governed Taiwan, which Chinese President Xi
Jinping has vowed to bring under Beijing\'s control. In response,
supporters of the government in Taipei, including the United States,
have stepped up their military presence in the region. This week, the
commander of the US Navy\'s 7th Fleet, headquartered in Japan, said more
US and partner aircraft carriers are needed in the western Pacific. Vice
Adm. Karl Thomas, speaking on board the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson
after large-scale naval exercises involving the US, Japan, Australia,
Canada and Germany, said aircraft carriers make a big statement of
deterrence. \"When we think about how we might fight, \... four aircraft
carriers is a good number, but six, seven or eight would be better,\"
Thomas said, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal.
Meanwhile, China \-- which already boasts the world\'s largest navy by
number of ships \-- is continuing to churn out new naval vessels. In
November, its fourth Type 55 destroyer, the Anshan, joined the People\'s
Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) fleet and a fifth is expected to do so by
year\'s end, Naval News reported. The Type 55s are considered to be
among the world\'s most modern and powerful surface combat ships. And
**[with more ships comes more potential for a mishap]{.underline}**, as
the US Congressional Research Service wrote last year in a report on the
South and East China Seas. **[Stepped-up US and Chinese military ship
and aircraft operations in the South China Sea \"could increase the risk
of a miscalculation or inadvertent action that could cause an accident
or lead to an incident that in turn could escalate into a crisis or
conflict,]{.underline}**\" the report said. And in 2018, that\'s almost
what happened when a Chinese destroyer sailed dangerously close to a US
guided missile destroyer in the South China Sea \-- in what the US Navy
described as an \"aggressive maneuver.\" The two ships came within 45
yards (41 meters) of each other, according to US Navy reports. But
Taiwan and its supporters are not standing still. Taipei last month
started construction on the first of a planned eight indigenously built
submarines. Australia, a vocal supporter of Taiwan and critic of
Beijing\'s increasing military pressure around the region, said earlier
this year it plans to build a fleet of nuclear-powered subs. Japan in
October launched the second boat in its new class of diesel-electric
submarines. The first in the Taigei class is expected to be commissioned
in March. **[The potential for collisions at sea was brought into focus
in October, when a US Navy sub, USS Connecticut, struck what the US
Pacific Fleet said was an undersea mountain in the South China
Sea]{.underline}**. The Connecticut, a nuclear-powered fast attack sub,
limped on the surface back to the US naval base on the Pacific island of
Guam after that incident. And in 2017, a spate of US Navy accidents in
Asia raised similar concerns. While there has been no indication the
alleged Chinese sub spotted Monday suffered an accident, \"it is an
interesting mystery,\" said Schuster, who also noted the PLA could have
simply been showing its muscle in the strait, as the US and its partner
navies have done recently.

increased spy ship activities in S.China Sea: think tank report," pg

**[A Beijing-based think tank is keeping an eye on an increase in
close-range reconnaissance activities this year by US Navy ocean
surveillance ships]{.underline}** i**[n the South China
Sea,]{.underline}** saying in a report released on Tuesday that the
**[US is attempting to monitor Chinese submarine activities in the
region and provide anti-submarine intelligence support. This situation
poses a significant threat not only to]{.underline}** the Chinese
People\'s Liberation Army (**[PLA) submarines, but also to its
submarine-based nuclear missiles]{.underline}**, Chinese experts warned,
and suggested countermeasures including noise disruptions by using
civilian and military vessels. In the first half of 2021, the South
China Sea saw a surge in US maritime reconnaissance activities, with all
five ocean surveillance ships owned by the US Navy - four
Victorious-class ships and an Impeccable-class ship - having conducted
missions in the region, the South China Sea Strategic Situation Probing
Initiative (SCSPI) said in the report. **[The US deployed at least one
surveillance ship to the South China Sea in at least 161 days out of the
total of 181 days in the first half of 2021]{.underline}**, a coverage
rate of 89 percent that indicates such deployments have become routine,
the SCSPI said. The US ships\' missions were likely intended to monitor
PLA submarine movements, analyze their key activity regions and
frequently used routes, and provide anti-submarine intelligence support,
the report said, noting that the US ocean surveillance ship activities
were accompanied by aerial monitoring, with more than 2,000 US spy
aircraft conducting close-range reconnaissance on China each year.
According to the SCSPI\'s monitoring, waters off the Xisha and Zhongsha
islands were some key points of interest for the US surveillance ships,
as the ocean there is more than 2,000 meters deep and has a complicated
environment, making the region a natural battlefield for underwater and
anti-submarine warfare. Before 2021, the US Navy rarely deployed ships
to the west of the Xisha Islands, but both the USNS Victorious and USNS
Impeccable conducted reconnaissance this year, the report pointed out.
**[Reportedly planning to build seven next-generation ocean surveillance
ships, the US is expected to further increase its maritime
reconnaissance activities in the South China Sea]{.underline}**, the
report said. **[US ocean surveillance ship activities are a huge threat
to the PLA, not only to its submarine forces, but also to its
submarine-based strategic nuclear missiles]{.underline}**, Song
Zhongping, a Chinese military expert and TV commentator, told the Global
Times on Tuesday. **[The US is gathering environmental information on
underwater battlefields and creating a database that can be used to
search for and attack PLA submarines much faster in a possible future
battle]{.underline}**, Song said.

Program). "The Risk of Nuclear War with China: A Troubling Lack of
Urgency." Union of Concerned Scientists. May 2016.

**[Summary Twenty-four hours a day, 365 days a year, the governments of
the United States and the People's Republic of China are a few poor
decisions away from starting a war that could escalate rapidly and end
in a nuclear exchange. Mismatched perceptions increase both the
possibility of war and the likelihood it will result in the use of
nuclear weapons. Miscommunication or misunderstanding could spark a
conflict that both governments may find difficult to stop. War between
the United States and the People's Republic of China is not inevitable,
but failing to acknowledge the risks is certain to make it more
likely.]{.underline}** Introduction The possibility that the United
States of America and the People's Republic of China (PRC) could become
involved in a nuclear war is increasing. Both governments must
acknowledge the danger if they hope to avoid it. Several factors
contribute to the risk of a nuclear war between the United States and
the People's Republic of China: • **[The United States and China have a
contentious history. Mutual mistrust sustains an entrenched and
deepening antagonism despite sincere and occasionally successful efforts
to cooperate on shared concerns such as climate change and nuclear
terrorism. • Both governments are preparing for war, including improving
their nuclear arsenals.]{.underline}** U.S. and PRC decision makers
believe they need a demonstrable readiness to use military force---
including nuclear weapons---to ensure the other nation will yield in a
military confrontation. • U.S. and PRC leaders try to avoid conflict,
but their discussions of contentious issues are inadequate. The
extensive military exchanges the governments have conducted have
produced memoranda of understanding on the conduct of naval vessels and
aircraft, but strategic dialogues on their nuclear forces, missile
defenses, and anti-satellite weapons are perfunctory. • U.S. and PRC
officials see the risk differently. U.S. officials are concerned that if
a military conflict starts, they may need to use nuclear weapons to stop
it. PRC officials assume that no nation would ever invite nuclear
retaliation by using nuclear weapons first. Their concern is to assure
the PRC maintains a credible ability to retaliate after a U.S. nuclear
attack. Can this peace that is not peace be maintained indefinitely?
**[Diplomacy has not slowed steadily accelerating preparations for war,
nor has it resolved U.S.-PRC disputes over the status of Taiwan, North
Korean threats, or the freedom of military navigation in East Asian
waters]{.underline}**. Keeping the peace depends on the skill and
patience of political leaders who seek to avoid conflict even as they
keep a nervous eye on the balance of rapidly evolving military
technologies they are not trained to assess. Former U.S. secretary of
defense Robert McNamara closed a lifetime of watching that balance by
warning, "The indefinite combination of human fallibility and nuclear
weapons will destroy nations" (Morris 2003). It is a warning the leaders
of the United States and the People's Republic of China should take to
heart.

Washington to deploy an ASW-capable USV as early as 2018. Unmanned ASW
platforms are expected to be deployed first along the First Island Chain

//um-ef)

WASHINGTON -- **[The U.S. Navy is collecting proposals for a new
autonomous glider drone that can collect data --- such as water
temperatures over time]{.underline}** --- as a way **[to improve how it
hunts for enemy submarines. The system will be the next generation of
the current Littoral Battlespace Sensing Glider]{.underline}**, which
generally deploys from one of the Navy's five oceanographic survey
ships. That glider became the center of an international incident in
2016 when China seized the drone, calling it a hazard to navigation.
**[The Navy would use the drones for measuring water conditions in
places where it might expect to need to hunt submarines in the future
and help guide fleet operational planning.]{.underline}** The drone
would need to be able to operate for 90 days at a time, dive to depths

according to documents posted to Naval Information Warfare Systems
Command's website. **[The Navy wants the drone to be able to loiter at

iridium satellite or a line-of-site datalink and be recoverable by

### 2AC \-\-- Subs Inevitable\-\--China/U.S

#### U.S and China AI Sub deployment inevitable

**StrategyPage 22** 6-3-2022, \"Submarines: The Robotic Naval Arms
Race,\" StrategyPage,
<https://www.strategypage.com/htmw/htsub/articles/20220603.aspx>

The **[navies of the United States and China are in a naval arms race as
each turns out more unmanned surface and subsurface
ships]{.underline}**. So far in 2022 **[China has produced the Zhu Hai
Yun]{.underline}**, a 2,000-ton ship that **[carries up to fifty
unmanned submarine, surface and airborne vehicles]{.underline}**. Zhu
Hai Yun is operated remotely to get it out to the high seas, where the
**[ship operates autonomously to carry out a variety of missions it is
capable of]{.underline}**. China is depending on its AI (Artificial
Intelligence) software to effectively carry out its mission and then
signal that it is returning. The **[U.S. Navy has similar but smaller
(145-ton) unmanned surface ships that do not carry and operate other
autonomous vehicles but can stay at sea for up to sixty days carrying
out ASW (Anti-submarine warfare) missions.]{.underline}** The **[navy
has also developed larger autonomous cargo ships to move supplies long
distances]{.underline}**. Smaller armed and unarmed autonomous vessels
have been in service for decades to patrol ports and coastal areas.
China believes it has a lead in AI control software and the Zhu Hai Yun
is an effort to test that. The Americans are depending on less ambitious
technologies that have produced impressive results so far and a **[new
Orca autonomous submarine takes those proven concepts further than ever
before.]{.underline}**

A month before China presented the Zhu Hai Yun, **[the Americans
received the first of 24 Orca 80-ton XLUUV]{.underline}** (extra-large
UUVs) that can carry and deploy a variety of naval mines and evade enemy
detection due to their small size.

Orca was the U.S. Navy solution to the difficulties with deploying
offensive mobile naval mines and a robotic submarine in enemy controlled
waters, like the South China Sea. Orca could even operate as an
offensive weapon against Chinese submarines seeking to block access to
the South China Sea and Taiwan. China is considered the major submarine
threat in the Pacific and the South China Sea is seen as a major future
battleground.

Currently China has about 55 diesel-electric subs of recent design in
service versus 42 operated by Japan and South Korea, each with 21.
Malaysia and Indonesia each have two and Australia has six. The United
States has about 30 nuclear attack subs in the Pacific. The anti-China
coalition also has a large array of surface and aerial ASW forces.

To even the odds **[China has built a network of underwater sensors in
the South China Sea that is complemented by ASW aircraft and surface
ships]{.underline}**. South Korea and Japan have similar technology
monitoring their coastal waters. The only nation capable of blocking
Chinese subs from moving out of the South China Sea is the United
States, which has underwater sensors and a large fleet of ASW aircraft.
The problem is defeating the Chinese diesel-electric submarine force.
China has been trying to build effective SSNs for decades and that is
still a work-in-progress. Chinese non-nuclear subs are another matter
and they have become world-class.

The U.S. Navy believes robotic subs carrying mobile mines would be an
effective new ASW asset because the **[U.S. is already developing some
of the new ASW technology needed for this.]{.underline}** This includes
UUVs (Unmanned Underwater Vessels) and mobile mines. Over a decade ago
the navy **[adopted civilian underwater UUVs used for monitoring the
oceans and has been using them to do that as well as collect data useful
for wartime submarine operations.]{.underline}** With a growing number
of civilian and military customers, **[American UUV developers and
manufacturers have been coming up with new ocean research UUVs that also
have military applications]{.underline}**. The latest example of this is
the new class of XLUUVs with the ability to go deeper, carry a cargo bay
for other research gear to be stored and deployed from, and operate
autonomously for up to six months. The first of these XLUUVs was the
Echo Voyager, which Boeing developed from a research project and had the
first one ready for testing in 2016. The tests were successful and have
involved more complex and completely autonomous operations. In 2019 the
navy ordered **[four militarized "Orca" versions of the Echo Voyager for
\$11 million each.]{.underline}** Both models are diesel-electric
powered autonomous subs that are 16 meters (51 feet) long with a payload
compartment 9.1 meters long and 2.6 meters (8.5 feet) in diameter and
inside the pressure hull. Propulsion is by battery powered electric
motors and diesel generators to recharge the batteries when on or near
the surface. This XLUUV has no topside sail and can stay underwater for
days at a time because there is no crew on board to sustain. While
submerged these UUVs can move at 14 kilometers an hour and have
sufficient generator fuel to travel 12,000 kilometers. The main
difference between Echo Voyager and Orca is that Echo Voyager is built
to dive to extreme (3,400 meters/11,000 feet) depths. Orca does without
that but adds additional passive sensors and signal processing computers
to detect other submarines or surface ships. There is also an underwater
communications system for arming the dozen Hammerhead mobile mines Orca
is designed to carry and place on the ocean floor in areas like the
South China Sea. These Hammerhead bottom mines carry a Mk 54 lightweight
torpedo, which is normally carried by ASW helicopters and aircraft. Mk
54 has a range of ten kilometers and a guidance system that is regularly
updated. Hammerhead is being used in a similar fashion to a larger
version of this used during the Cold War that deployed a larger Mk 48
torpedo. Hammerhead is an encapsulated system equipped with passive
sensors to detect and identify submarines and surface ships and attack
specific types of targets, like diesel-electric subs larger than Orca.

intelligence](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/techland-when-great-power-competition-meets-digital-world/how-strengthen-america%E2%80%99s-artificial) (**[AI]{.underline}**)
**[into its ship systems, weapons, networks, and command and control
infrastructure]{.underline}** **[as computer automation becomes more
reliable and advanced algorithms make once-impossible]{.underline}**
discernments and **[analyses]{.underline}**.

**[Previously segmented data streams on]{.underline}** ships, drones,
aircraft, and
even [**[submarines]{.underline}**](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/navy-budget-request-includes-additional-funding-submarine-construction-201643) **[are
now increasingly able to share organized data in
real-time]{.underline}**, in large measure **[due to breakthrough
advances in AI and machine learning]{.underline}**. AI can, for
instance, enable command and control systems to identify moments of
operational relevance from among hours or days or surveillance data in
milliseconds, something which saves time, maximizes efficiency, and
performs time-consuming procedural tasks autonomously at an
exponentially faster speed.

"**[Multiple data bytes of information will be passed around
on]{.underline}** the **[networks]{.underline}** here **[in the near
future]{.underline}**. So as we think about **[big data,]{.underline}**
and how do we handle all that data and turn it into information without
getting overloaded, this **[will be a key part of A]{.underline}**I,
then we\'re talking about handling decentralized systems," Nathan Husted
of the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock told an audience at the
2022 Sea Air Space Symposium. " ..and of course, AI plays a big part in
the management in between the messaging and operation and organization
of these decentralized systems." 

[AI's
success](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/techland-when-great-power-competition-meets-digital-world/artificial-intelligence-and-future) could
be described paradoxically: in one sense, its utility or value is only
as effective as the size and quality of its ever-expanding database. Yet
by contrast, its conclusions, findings, or "answers" are very small and
precise. Perhaps only two seconds of drone video identify the
sought-after enemy target, yet surveillance cameras have hours if not
days of data. AI can reduce the procedural burden placed upon humans and
massively expedite the decisionmaking process. 

"If we look at the battlespace, **[we are]{.underline}** actually
**[training for the future]{.underline}**. As we look at AI in the
battlespace ... we\'ve got big data and AI systems. So we\'re going to
have this extremely complicated, information-rich combat environment,"
Husted said...

**[Navy industry partners also see AI as an evolving technology that
will progressively integrate into]{.underline}** more **[ship
systems]{.underline}**, command and control, **[and
weapons]{.underline}** **[over tim]{.underline}**e as processing speeds
increase and new algorithms increase their reliability by honing their
ability to assimilate new or unrecognized incoming data. This building
block approach, for example, has been adopted by Northrop Grumman in its
development of a new ship-integrated energy management, distribution,
and storage technology called [Integrated Power and Energy
Systems](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/integrated-power-and-energy-system-will-forever-change-naval-combat-201806) (IPES).
For instance, Northrop Grumman's solution is built to accommodate new
computing applications as they become available, such as AI-generated
power optimization and electric plant controls. 

The **[technology seeks to]{.underline}** organize and store energy
sources to **[optimize]{.underline}** distribution across a sphere of
otherwise separated **[ship assets such as]{.underline}**
**[lasers]{.underline}**, **[sensors]{.underline}**, **[command and
control]{.underline}**, **[radar]{.underline}**, **[or
weapons]{.underline}**. **[AI]{.underline}**-enabled computing can help
**[organize incoming metrics and sensor data]{.underline}** from
disparate ship systems to optimize storage and streamline distribution
as needed from a single source depending upon need. 

"AI is an emerging capability that shows promise in some of these more
complex electrical architectures to manage in near real-time. **[Future
capability]{.underline}** that **[would rely upon A]{.underline}**I
**[and be more computationally intensive]{.underline}** is likely to
happen in some aspects of electric plant controls," Matthew
Superczynski, chief engineer for Northrop Grumman's Power/Control
Systems, told The National Interest in an interview.  "We are building
upon the architecture the Navy already has to give them more capability
and lower risk. We can build on top of that."

### 2AC/1AR \-\-- Sub Militarization Inev

The developments do not stop there. A **[new class of Russian submarine,
the Khabarovsk, will be fitted to carry the giant superfast autonomous
nuclear torpedo]{.underline}**, Poseidon, in effect an underwater
nuclear-powered drone, capable of speeds of up to 180km/h (112mph) and
armed with a huge, multi-megaton nuclear warhead. The torpedo's range is
virtually unlimited and is designed to destroy ports, coastal cities and
large fleet concentrations.

Future plans

**[Russia is not the only country upgrading its
submarines]{.underline}**. **[France, the UK and the US]{.underline}**
are all **[developing and building the next class of missile and attack
sub.]{.underline}** They can dive deeper to avoid detection and advances
in engine design mean they are even quieter and therefore stealthier
than previous generations. Many of these designs **[have already been
fielded, while others are near completion.]{.underline}**

**[China and India are also working on their own improved nuclear sub
designs]{.underline}** in an effort to dominate their own seas and keep
up with regional competitors. There can be setbacks. India's first
nuclear-powered missile sub, the INS Arihant, was damaged when a hatch
was left open, allowing water to partially flood the sub. The design has
since been finalised and a second missile sub, or SSBN, INS Arighat is
undergoing trials.

It is not all about nuclear propulsion. Improvements in Air Independent
Propulsion (AIP) now allow non-nuclear submarines some of the advantages
of their nuclear cousins.

Able to stay submerged for weeks at a time, these cheaper submarines
give middle-ranking naval powers an affordable way to enhance their
naval firepower, while also using their stealthy abilities to gather
intelligence and land special forces teams ashore, their mission
flexibility giving their commanders more options.

Unmanned Underwater Vehicles **[(UUVs), are also starting to make their
presence felt.]{.underline}** These **[robot subs can gather
intelligence, lay mines and sweep the seas around them for enemy
vessels.]{.underline}** The US navy is planning a whole range of them,
such as **[Boeing's Orca,]{.underline}** with other navies following
suit. Able to **[operate autonomously]{.underline}**, they can stay at
sea for months at a time, **[sending valuable data back to their
headquarters while remaining hidden]{.underline}**. At least that is the
idea. No country has publicly claimed a robotic submersible that was
found a few years ago by a Chinese fishing vessel in the South China
Sea. It was capable of satellite communications and recording images,
and was suspected by the Chinese authorities of being used to spy on
Chinese naval activity in the area.

**[China itself is developing its own fleet of unmanned AI-controlled
submarines]{.underline}** that, once completed, will be capable of a
wide variety of missions. Without having to worry about keeping a human
crew safe, these **[robot subs can be smaller, stay at sea almost
indefinitely and operate at greater depths]{.underline}** as they can be
built differently to withstand the incredible pressures of the very deep
sea.

Even **[minor nuclear power North Korea is researching how to turn
small, yet quiet diesel-electric subs into missile
carriers]{.underline}** for its fledgeling nuclear weapons arsenal.
Pyongyang is keen to develop its own invulnerable second strike
retaliatory capability, ensuring the survival of the country.

**[Some]{.underline}** journalists **[have drawn]{.underline}** direct
(but **[erroneous]{.underline}**) **[parallels between the technological
advancements enjoyed by]{.underline}** remotely **[piloted UAVs
and]{.underline}** the far more technically challenging **[autonomous
UUV]{.underline}** situation.2 This has **[led some to claim that
low-cost UUVs will make 'the seas transparen]{.underline}**t'.3 The
**[assertion]{.underline}** is that **[UUVs will be able to roam the
oceans]{.underline}** in **[massive numbers searching for
submarines]{.underline}**, **[particularly]{.underline}** the
Trident-armed Vanguard-class **[SSBNs]{.underline}**. Although admitting
that this will take some time, they claim that it will eventually render
the Vanguard's replacement, the Dreadnought class, obsolete.4 However,
the political desire to find some argument that will suddenly undermine
the case for SSBNs has **[led to some]{.underline}** mistaken
assumptions and **[incorrect conclusions]{.underline}**. For instance,
opponents to Dreadnought have **[failed to take into account the laws of
physics]{.underline}**. It is these **[laws that contribute to making
the oceans opaque]{.underline}**; they **[present]{.underline}**
**[significant difficulties]{.underline}** that may be **[impossible
for]{.underline}** **[technology to overcome]{.underline}**. Scientists,
engineers and naval officers with knowledge of the subject regard these
claims with extreme scepticism.5 This article explains some of the
capabilities and limitations of the technology, in the process
dispelling many assertions that have been put forward.

The main difficulties of detecting submarines in the open ocean with
autonomous vehicles are twofold. First, there is the **[challenge faced
by all sensors trying to detect very small signals]{.underline}** **[in
an environment that mutes and distorts indications of the submarine's
presence]{.underline}**. Second, there are the **[practical problems of
powering the autonomous vehicles]{.underline}** so that their sensors
are effective and so that the vehicles can be positioned where they can
deliver real operational value. As such, the **[claims]{.underline}**
that **[SSBNs will be made obsolete]{.underline}** because they will
**[be easily detected by autonomous vehicles]{.underline}** in the open
ocean **[are not credible.]{.underline}**

**[There are]{.underline}**, nevertheless, **[ways]{.underline}** in
which **[such vehicles could be developed to assist ASW
forces.]{.underline}** While they are **[unlikely to make the seas
transparent]{.underline}**, there are **[areas where they could give ASW
forces an advantage]{.underline}** and force submarine captains to adopt
different tactics. Examining the continuing development of autonomous
technology is important as a means to understand their potential and to
develop the Royal Navy's response**[. The US has identified UUVs asa
disruptive technology,]{.underline}** but only **[envisages them in
roles that support ever-more sophisticated ASW
operations]{.underline}**.6

Transparent, Translucent or Opaque Seas

'**[Transparent oceans' implies]{.underline}** that **[all submarines
can be 'seen']{.underline}** wherever they are,
**[rendering]{.underline}** the **[deterrent obsolete]{.underline}**
**[because they would be easy prey for a pre-emptive
strike]{.underline}**. However, **[this fails to pass critical
scrutiny]{.underline}**. Richard L Garwin proposed a typology that
distinguished between different types of threats to strategic
submarines. These were categorised as 'open-ocean search', 'tracking'
and 'trailing'.7 Each of these types indicates a different level of
confidence in the position of an adversary's submarine: **[for
open-ocean search, there is]{.underline}** **[no
knowledge]{.underline}** **[of wherea submarine is within the deployable
zone;]{.underline}** for tracking, the location can be narrowed to a
more specific area; and in trailing situations, the submarine is kept
within weapons range.8 **[Nuclear powers]{.underline}**, each deploying
a seaborne force of submarines with nuclear missiles, **[are ensured of
strategic stability]{.underline}** **[provided]{.underline}** that the
**[position]{.underline}** of their submarines **[is extremely difficult
to determine.]{.underline}**9 This article argues that **[detecting an
adversary's submarine]{.underline}** **[is near
impossible]{.underline}** in the open ocean.

Autonomous Vehicles in a Submarine Open-ocean Search Role

The **[reason]{.underline}** that **[nuclear-powered submarines were
chosen to carry]{.underline}** the **[nuclear-armed
missiles]{.underline}** of the continuous at-sea deterrent is that **[it
is extremely difficult to detect a submarine. SSBNs are designed not to
be found]{.underline}** **[and to operate in oceans that give them ample
opportunity to disappear.]{.underline}** As they are nuclear-powered,
they can remain submerged at depth for months.

If UAVs were to search for SSBNs, the first of many challenges would be
how to detect the submarine. The sensors that UAVs use above water --
cameras, thermal imagers and radar -- employ detectors that function by
using electromagnetic waves. However, these waves can penetrate only the
uppermost layers of the ocean, because seawater is a good conductor of
electricity. The laws of physics state that the intensity of
electromagnetic waves falls exponentially as they penetrate a conductor.
At the wavelengths employed by the sensors mentioned, the Beer--Lambert
Law determines that these waves can only penetrate a few millimetres of
seawater. An exception is light detection and ranging imagers that use
blue-green light and multispectral laser imagers.10 These can probe
50--100 m deep in clear blue waters. However, even this is insufficient
to reach the typical operating depths of a nuclear submarine. Except in
transparent waters, these techniques are severely limited, and cannot
penetrate far into the sediment-rich and turbulent waters that SSBNs
generally inhabit.

Aircraft use one type of sensor to search for submarines that has been
proposed for UAVs -- magnetic anomaly detectors. These sense the
disturbance of the Earth's magnetic field produced by the submarine's
ferromagnetic hull and steel components. The steel hull of a submarine
(and of most surface ships) not only acts as a large magnet, but its
movement through the water generates additional magnetic effects. These
effects can be mitigated if a submarine uses a degaussing system --
coils of wire within the vessel that carry an electrical current to
generate an equal and opposite magnetic field to that of the hull. This
'magnetic cloaking device' cancels out the magnetic disturbance. The
latest 'closed-loop degaussing system' is very effective at reducing a
submarine's magnetic signature. Nevertheless, close to the vessel the
magnetic field of the submarine is irregular and difficult to cancel out
completely. This gives some opportunity for the small residual magnetic
disturbance to be detected within about 1 km, meaning that magnetic
anomaly detectors are very short-range sensors.

Advances in technology have led to the miniaturisation of magnetic
anomaly detectors so they could be mounted on UAVs; these detectors are
now being considered for the ship- and aircraft-launched MagEagle
version of the ScanEagle autonomous UAVs.11 These UAVs would be useful
for anti-submarine warfare forces to confirm the exact position of a
submarine that has already been detected. However, their detection range
is so modest that searching the vast spaces of the unpredictable oceans
is unlikely to be the best use of UAVs. Moreover, advances in detection
technology are usually countered by advances in signature reduction
(improved degaussing) and consequent further reduction of detection
ranges. The introduction of new countermeasures to confuse the detector
would also mitigate the advances in detection technology.

Other non-acoustic detection techniques have been kept under review,
with wake detection perhaps having some potential.12 As a submarine
advances it pushes water aside. This generates a conical wave pattern
that spreads out from the bow of the submarine. Where this cone breaks
the surface of the sea it manifests itself as a triangular set of low
surface waves that, in calm water, could be used to detect a submarine's
recent track. However, to extract this wake pattern from the complex
wave patterns of, say, the North Atlantic Ocean requires a great deal of
signal processing. This is a substantial computational task and probably
beyond the possible computer payload of a UAV, or even a satellite. In
addition to the complexity of surface waves, like all signatures, there
are difficulties because of interference from similar signals, including
those produced by surface ships, whales and shoals of fish. To ensure
that conventional submarines are efficient when they are powered through
the water, naval architects aim to reduce wake to ensure efficiency.
This is currently not of great concern to nuclear submarines because of
their large power plants. However, wake reduction may become more
important, requiring modification of the outer hull shape and the
development of offboard decoys.

**[UUVs]{.underline}**, the UAVs' underwater cousins, **[are used mainly
to gather small sets of oceanographic data]{.underline}** **[using
simple onboard sensors]{.underline}** powered by modest batteries. They
either drift or are driven at very low speeds, so they are limited in
their trajectories by currents. To overcome currents and allow them to
search on a predetermined course for long periods would require
significant developments in battery or fuel-cell technology.

**[Navies have been using tethered UUVs]{.underline}** **[for
mine-hunting operations for decades]{.underline}**, **[but only recently
have these become autonomous.]{.underline}**13 Nevertheless,
**[searching for mines in predetermined positions]{.underline}** with
the close support of surface vessels **[is a long way from searching
totally autonomously for submarines in the whole ocean.]{.underline}**

Even if there were a clear operational imperative to build vast numbers
of low-cost UUVs to detect submarines, **[the]{.underline}** **[complex
underwater environment]{.underline}** **[presents]{.underline}** **[many
obstacles to their development for a search role.]{.underline}** As
**[radar]{.underline}** **[cannot be used underwater]{.underline}**, the
**[detection]{.underline}** of submarines **[relies on sonars to sense
acoustic waves]{.underline}** emitted by the submarines. This
**[technique]{.underline}**, passive sonar, is covert and enables the
sonar to obtain the direction of any source of the sound it detects.
However, **[determining]{.underline}** the **[distance of the sound
source]{.underline}** **[is]{.underline}** more
**[diffcult]{.underline}**.

The sonars search a wide range of acoustic frequencies from low to high
(typically below 10 kHz to above 30 kHz). The lower frequencies travel
long distances underwater but, to exploit them, the acoustic sensors
(hydrophone arrays) need to be very large. UUVs are constrained to the
higher (shorter-range) frequencies unless they can accommodate large
arrays or tow long arrays, and to do that, they would need to be the
size, and have the complexity, of a small submarine.14

**[If an SSBN does not want to be found]{.underline}**, then
**[detecting it is very difficult]{.underline}**. Thanks to
**[noise-reduction technology,]{.underline}** the **[sound emissions of
nuclear-powered submarines]{.underline}** are **[very]{.underline}**,
very **[low]{.underline}**. **[Submarines]{.underline}** themselves
**[are the quintessential submarine detector because they are equipped
to be aware of underwater threats]{.underline}**. They are fitted with
extensive sets of arrays and typically have more than 10,000 hydrophone
sensors whose data are analysed using powerful computers.15
Nevertheless, **[even they find it difficult to detect other
submarines]{.underline}**. For example, **[in 2009 there was a collision
between two SSBN]{.underline}**s, HMS Vanguard and the French Navy's Le
Triomphant.16 The **[boats did not detect each other, despite having
teams of highly trained sonar operators]{.underline}** using
sophisticated passive sonars, even when they were almost close enough to
touch. The then French Defence Minister Hervé Morin said: 'We face an
extremely simple technological problem, which is that these submarines
are not detectable. They make less noise than a shrimp'.17 While this
may have been an exaggeration, it indicates the challenges facing any
autonomous UUV searching for any modern submarine. In 2010, the Royal
Navy's latest fleet submarine, HMS Astute, entered service, and it has
even better sound reduction features than HMS Vanguard,18 which will
presumably be further enhanced for the Dreadnought SSBNs.

**[Detecting an SSBN is]{.underline}** a **[challenge both for other
submarines and for specialist]{.underline}** **[ASW ships]{.underline}**
deploying long towed arrays. These comprise long arrays of hydrophones
that can detect low frequencies emanating from far away as well as
having the directionality that limits unwanted noise interference. **[As
UUVs are unable to deploy low-frequency sensors]{.underline}**, they
would be **[severely limited in detection ranges.]{.underline}**

A **[major factor that makes detection particularly difficult is the
abundance of noises]{.underline}** that **[propagate well at the low
frequencies]{.underline}** used to search for submarines.19 Crashing
waves and the lashing of rain produce background interference in the
open ocean, especially in areas where submarines like to lurk.
**[Man-made noises]{.underline}** from the **[world's shipping activity
generate]{.underline}** **[significant noise 'pollution']{.underline}**
that travels far from busy trade routes. Other forms of marine life,
such as whales and large shoals of fish, will also add to the cacophony.

The interference is even greater in coastal regions where there are many
more ships, some of which are even noisier than container ships. Within
the littoral there are, worldwide, billions of alpheid (snapping) shrimp
that, together, produce a noise that swamps that of the quietest
submarine.

**[Very sensitive acoustic detectors can be produced for
UUVs,]{.underline}** although **[not necessarily at the most useful
frequencies.]{.underline}** However, sensitivity is not the key factor.
**[A more sensitive detector can detect quieter sounds]{.underline}**
but is **[more susceptible to noise interference]{.underline}**. Using
binoculars to find a car lost in the fog does not improve the visibility
-- it just enables the fog to be seen more easily. Like a person
searching in fog, **[the range of UUV sensors]{.underline}**, already
handicapped by only being able to operate at high frequencies, **[is
further limited by interference]{.underline}**, particularly in coastal
waters. **[Even with improved processing power,]{.underline}** this
**[limitation precludes significant improvements in UUV sensor
ability.]{.underline}** Like UAVs, the detection range of UUVs is
noticeably constrained by environmental factors.

The use of **[a 'swarm' of UUVs]{.underline}** has been compared to the
use of swarms of UAVs in other contexts.20 However, the swarm concept is
not just about numbers. It **[requires]{.underline}** the **[UUVs to
cooperate with each other]{.underline}** so that their search is
coordinated. This **[requires the interchange of a great deal of data
over a significant rang]{.underline}**e. Unfortunately,
**[range]{.underline}** and **[data transfer]{.underline}** rates of
**[underwater communications]{.underline}** by acoustic techniques
**[are limited]{.underline}**, **[which imposes practical
constraints]{.underline}** on UUV swarms.

In the future, the use of large aperture arrays in conjunction with
advanced adaptive or statistical signal processing and array processing
techniques may be able to extend the detection range. The longer arrays
would exploit the low-frequency signature in particular environments and
circumstances. However, towing or deploying and processing a large array
would place demands on the electrical power available from a UUV and the
performance benefits would be variable, dependent on environmental
conditions such as propagation, noise and interference.

Using sonar to detect submarines has to take into account the nature of
acoustic propagation. Sonar signals are distorted by changes in the
speed of sound in seawater that is, itself, dependent on factors such as
temperature, pressure and salinity. Changes of the speed of sound with
depth often increase then decrease to produce horizontal layers that
diffract sonar signals in such a way that they cannot penetrate the
adjacent layers. These effects vary from one part of the ocean to
another as well as changing over time. In addition, the edges of ocean
currents represent sharp temperature changes that can produce changes in
the propagation of sonar waves, characterised by a vertical
discontinuity that cannot be penetrated by sonar waves. Submarines are
equipped to determine the spatial and temporal variability of the
ocean's propagation characteristics, but this would be extremely
difficult for UUVs. Not only does the seawater's inhomogeneity make
sonar detection difficult, but, at times, it renders the seas
impenetrable to sonar and provides submarines with opportunities to
vanish.21

It is true that **[as detection and classification techniques continue
to evolve]{.underline}**, **[detecting and classifying very weak
signal]{.underline}**s -- against background noise and interference --
**[will remain a fundamental challenge.]{.underline}**

**[UUVs will be further hampered by the difficulty of alerting other
forces]{.underline}** to their **[presence were any contact made,
especially if they were deep in the ocean]{.underline}**.
**[Communications]{.underline}** below water **[are short
range]{.underline}**, so the **[UUV would have to ascend nearly to the
surface]{.underline}** (or even to the surface) **[in order to
establish]{.underline}** a satellite **[communications
link.]{.underline}**

**[There are]{.underline}** **[many types of autonomous

potential ASW role]{.underline}**. **[UAVs]{.underline}**, UUVs and
**[USVs are all being developed]{.underline}**, and the tasks that they
are being designed to perform are varied. However, what emerges is that
the environmental conditions experienced by the different types of drone
are different and this limits the types of operations that they can
carry out.

Unlike many of the tasks undertaken by drones in general, **[searching
for submarines]{.underline}** is **[extremely difficult as the latter
are designed to disappear]{.underline}**. For this reason, **[autonomous
vehicles are]{.underline}** **[unlikely to represent a revolutionary
change, although their emerging capability will have implications for
submarine and ASW operations]{.underline}**. There is a potential
evolutionary path that incorporates autonomous vehicle technology into
naval operations that will improve effectiveness or lower costs. The use
of autonomous vehicles (especially large, fast USVs, large ship-deployed
UUVs and UAVs) could deny areas of operation to submarines, but such
overt surveillance would be open to avoidance, and could be challenged
by other naval vessels and countermeasures as part of a layered defence.

**[The below-water sensors available to]{.underline}** UAVs (laser,
magnetic anomaly) and **[UUVs]{.underline}** (high-frequency sonar)
**[have very short detection ranges]{.underline}**. Even if a

**[make the oceans transparent]{.underline}** is
**[misleading]{.underline}** because it **[would take an immense number
of vehicles to cover even a fraction of an SSBN's operational
areas.]{.underline}**

### 2AC \-\-- Strategic Stability Fake

#### The concept of [strategic stability]{.underline} is wrong

**Podvig 12 ---** A physicist trained at the Moscow Institute of Physics
and Technology, Podvig works on the Russian nuclear arsenal, US-Russian
relations, and nonproliferation. In 1995, he headed the Russian
Strategic Nuclear Forces Research Project. Pavel Podvig, \"The myth of
strategic stability,\" Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, 10-31-2012,
https://thebulletin.org/2012/10/the-myth-of-strategic-stability/,
accessed 7-4-2022, WMK

**[Strategic stability]{.underline}** is one of **[those ideas that seem
to enjoy almost unqualified support]{.underline}** among nuclear and
non-nuclear weapon states, nuclear disarmament advocates and skeptics,
as well as nuclear abolitionists and nuclear hawks. And it is probably
because of this universal support that the pursuit of strategic
stability became the single most serious obstacle on the way toward
nuclear disarmament.

Strategic stability usually **[refers to a state of affairs in which
countries]{.underline}** are **[confident that their adversaries would
not be able to undermine their nuclear deterrent
capability]{.underline}**. It is generally believed that, **[if the
nuclear deterrence potentials are secure]{.underline}**, **[nuclear
powers would not feel the need to build up their strategic
arsenals]{.underline}** and, most important, **[would not be under
pressure to launch their missiles]{.underline}** in a crisis. Understood
this way, strategic stability does not seem a particularly controversial
concept. Few people would advocate instability in matters that involve
nuclear weapons. But the problem is that the **[key elements of the
concept]{.underline}** are **[so poorly defined]{.underline}** **[that
it has no useful meaning]{.underline}** and virtually no practical
value.

First of all, the **[numbers]{.underline}** that are **[used to judge
the effectiveness of deterrence have always been completely
arbitrary.]{.underline}** For example, in the early 1980s, the US
intelligence agencies estimated that, in the event of a surprise Soviet
attack, surviving launchers in each of the three legs of the US
strategic triad could independently destroy about 70 percent of the
Soviet economic value --- a task that would require thousands of
surviving warheads. And still the United States was concerned that this
might not be enough to deter the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union, on the
other hand, had a different view of what was necessary for effective
deterrence: A Soviet official document from the late 1980s estimated
that its retaliatory strike would destroy about 80 targets on US
territory. Given that the Soviet strategic force still included more
than 10,000 nuclear warheads at the time, this number does not seem
particularly large. However, the authors of the estimate seemed quite
confident that such a capability would provide the Soviet Union with an
adequate deterrence potential.

These numbers are probably much lower today, but they are almost
certainly as arbitrary as they were in the 1980s**[. All evidence
suggests that the estimations of the number of weapons that might be
required for deterrence]{.underline}** have always been determined by
the number of weapons available --- rather than the other way around.
So, once nuclear states start cutting down their nuclear arsenals, they
have no problem adjusting their views of efficient deterrence
accordingly. In August, for example, a former commander of the US
Strategic Command stated on record that "the retaliatory capability of
300 nuclear weapons on anybody's territory is catastrophic." But there
is no reason to believe that the retaliatory capability of, say, 30
nuclear weapons --- or even three --- is anything but catastrophic.
Indeed, the experience of the Cuban Missile Crisis or concerns about the
emerging nuclear capabilities of countries like North Korea and Iran
tells us that just a small probability of having a single nuclear weapon
delivered to someone's territory is a very strong deterrent.

The arbitrary nature of the assumptions that underlie the idea of
strategic stability makes this concept extremely malleable and
politically charged. Depending on the politics of the moment, **[just
about any configuration of strategic forces]{.underline}** **[could be
declared sufficiently stable]{.underline}** or dangerously unbalanced,
**[and any imaginable threat could be brought into the equation or
conveniently ignored]{.underline}**. On the surface it may not look this
way --- there is, after all, an intellectual tradition that explains,
for example, why silo-based multiple-warhead missiles are destabilizing
weapons or why missile defense undermines strategic stability.
Historically, however, it has always been the politics and not the
theoretical arguments that have had the upper hand in most of these
discussions; even the most difficult strategic stability problems are
usually resolved by a simple decision that they are not problem anymore.

The **[US Navy is developing]{.underline}** **[AI-controlled
submarines]{.underline}** that **[could have the ability to kill without
human control.]{.underline}**

The project --- called **[CLAWS]{.underline}** --- is being led by the
Office of Naval Research, which is responsible for the science and
technology programs of the US Navy and Marine Corps.

Budget documents uncovered by New Scientist, describe CLAWS as **[an
"autonomous unmanned undersea weapon system]{.underline}**" **[that
could be installed on robot submarines]{.underline}** such as the Orca
underseas vehicle being developed by Boeing.

These boats will be armed with 12 torpedo tubes that could be controlled
by CLAWS **[without]{.underline}** **[any input from a
human.]{.underline}**

"It will clandestinely extend the reach of large UUVs \[unmanned
underwater vehicles\] and increase the mission areas into kinetic
effects," read the documents.

Prototype on its way

CLAWS was first revealed in 2018 as an at**[tempt to "improve the
autonomy and survivability of large and extra-large unmanned underwater
vehicle]{.underline}**s." However, there had been no mention of a
weapons capability until now, according to New Scientist.

The budget documents reveal that CLAWS has been allocated \$26 million
this year and another \$23 million for next year, which will be used to
develop the idea into a working prototype.

Stuart Russell, a professor of computer science at the University of
California, who described CLAWS as a "dangerous development."

"Equipping a fully autonomous vehicle with lethal weapons is a
significant step, and one that risks accidental escalation in a way that
does not apply to sea mines," he told New Scientist.

Lethal autonomous weapons on their way?

The U**[.S. and its NATO allies are teaming up to more closely cooperate
on the development and fielding of unmanned maritime
systems]{.underline}**, according to an agreement **[signed
by]{.underline}** the defense heads of **[13 NATO allies.]{.underline}**

During the July summit, **[the powers signed onto a plan to jointly
pursue technologies aimed at mine and sub hunting]{.underline}**,
according to an October news release making the agreement public.

"The **[use of unmanned systems]{.underline}** is a **[potentially game
changing leap forward in maritime technology,]{.underline}**" the
release read. "**[Working alongside traditional naval
assets]{.underline}**, these **[unmanned systems will increase both our
situational awareness and our control of the seas."]{.underline}**

The release, while short on details, seems to open up the possibility
that development of underwater and surface drones could be even more
lucrative for companies involved, as it hints at the alliance seeking
common, interoperable systems. That means a proven drone might be
competing for business in 13 markets simultaneously instead of just one.

"Through this initiative, Allies will also be able to exploit economies
of scale to reduce costs, allowing increasing defence budgets to go even
further," the release said.

The countries involved in the agreement are Belgium, Denmark, Germany,
Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Turkey,
the United Kingdom and the United States.

For NATO watchers, the agreement is the latest sign of just how
seriously the alliance is taking the threat from Russian submarines.

"**[NATO members are alarmed by the growing threat from Russian
submarines]{.underline}**, **[and]{.underline}** are **[investing more
resources to deal with it,"]{.underline}** said Jorge Benitez, a senior
fellow at the Atlantic Council who previously served as the lead on NATO
issues for the Office of the Secretary of Defense. "Under \[President
Vladimir\] Putin, Russia has deployed new, stealthier submarines in the
north Atlantic that are much harder for NATO navies to track.

"**[This new multinational cooperation]{.underline}** in **[undersea
drones]{.underline}** is the mo**[st recent example that NATO is taking
the Russian threat in the north Atlantic much more
seriously]{.underline}** than it has in the past quarter century."

**[Russia]{.underline}** is **[developi]{.underline}**ng a system

**[underwater]{.underline}** **[vehicles]{.underline}** with a total
displacement of 500-1,000 tons, **[will be deployed in a range of
missions, including against an enemy aircraft carrier, the Moscow-based
news outlet explained.]{.underline}**

"For example, the command post sets a common task --- to destroy the
enemy aircraft carrier strike group. **[Artificial
intelligence]{.underline}**, **[which will]{.underline}**
**[control]{.underline}** **[the swarm of underwater
drones]{.underline}**, **[solves this problem]{.underline}** in

the news outlet quoted the source as saying.

"Then you need to focus on one of the areas. **[Then make a maneuver and
shift efforts to another direction]{.underline}**. Then, for a while,
withdraw from the battle and mislead the enemy with demonstrative
actions," the source, which the website claimed is embedded in the
country's military-industrial complex, added.

"All this will be done by artificial intelligence, which receives data
on the situation from a wide variety of sources."

Currently, **[system developers are working on refining the
inter-medium]{.underline}** (air to water)
**[transmission]{.underline}** **[of control]{.underline}** commands.

The "latest electronic gyroscopes"--- devices that detect the deviation
of an object from its desired orientation --- will be fitted into the
vehicles for navigation.

"Their error per 1,000 km (621 miles) of track can be significantly less
than 100 meters (0.062 miles). This will allow the drone to be brought
into the vicinity of the target with great accuracy," the website wrote.

Since **[the unmanned vehicles are]{.underline}** **[generally
cheaper]{.underline}** **[than their manned counterparts and do not
carry the risk of human casualties]{.underline}**, **[the Russian navy
can much more easily afford to lose a vehicle during operations
compared.]{.underline}**

The news of the development of a swarm of underwater and surface drones
**[comes on the heels]{.underline}** **[of]{.underline}** **[Moscow's

the UUV deployed on a fixed course 30ft below the surface.

It was **[able to identify the location of the submarine, change course,

torpedo.]{.underline}**

The UUV used sonar and onboard sensors to fetch data, which were
analysed by the computer, to help it make complete the task.

The experiments were described in papers written by researchers at
Harbin Engineering University in 2010 and declassified last week.

\'The needs of future underwater warfare bring new development
opportunities for the unmanned platforms,\' wrote the scientists, led by
Professor Liang Guolong.

He added the UUVs - which have presumably developed since 2010 - could
be programmed to operate in a group and make simultaneous attacks on one
target.

**[oceans]{.underline}** **[to evade detection,]{.underline}**
**[sneaking up on enemy ships before ambushing them with a brace of
missiles or torpedoes.]{.underline}** Modern submarines can attack their
targets while fully submerged, making visual or radar detection
impossible. **[ASW hunters must find them via sound, using sonar to
detect lurking submarines.]{.underline}**

One way of doing so is through the use of so-called \"**[active
sonar]{.underline}**.\" Active **[uses a burst of sound
energy]{.underline}**, **[transmitted through the water, to detect
unseen objects]{.underline}**. The thriller film The Hunt for Red
October made this burst, often called a \"ping,\" famous when it debuted
in 1990; It\'s probably the first sound you imagine when you consider a
submarine. As the burst travels through the water, it bounces off of
underwater objects and returns in the direction from which it came,
boomerang-style. **[A sub\'s crew can then analyze the sonar return to
determine if it\'s coming from an enemy submarine. Counting the time it
takes for bursts to return also allows the sub hunters to figure out the
direction in which the enemy subs are traveling.]{.underline}**

But **[another way]{.underline}** to identify submarines
**[is]{.underline}** **[via aircraft,]{.underline}** **[and
it\'s]{.underline}** **[extremely effective]{.underline}**. **[Airborne
sub hunters]{.underline}** are capable of **[search]{.underline}**ing
**[vast distances]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}**
**[respond]{.underline}**ing **[quickly]{.underline}** **[to reports of
enemy submarines.]{.underline}** The problem for airplanes is that,
**[unlike surface ships and other submarines, they are]{.underline}**
**[unable]{.underline}** **[to utilize any sort of built-in
sonar]{.underline}**, since they travel over the water rather than
through it.

That\'s where sonobuoys come in. The **[floating sensors can listen to
the ocean and relay that data to aircraft flying above]{.underline}**.
The long, thin buoy is one portion of the two-part Air Deployable Active
Receiver (ADAR) system. A P-3 or P-8 anti-submarine aircraft, MH-60
Seahawk helicopter, or even a surface ship will drop AN/SSQ-101 and
AN/SSQ-125 sonobuoys in an attempt to find an enemy sub.

Once released, the AN/SSQ-101 enters the water and deploys its payload.
**[One of the first things it releases is a floating transmitter that
bobs on the surface of the ocean, relaying whatever information it finds
to nearby friendly ships and aircraft]{.underline}**. Next, the sonobuoy
unfolds a five-sided array of 40 underwater microphones (known as
hydrophones), creating an underwater listening post.

The other half of the ADAR system is the AN/SSQ-110A sonobuoy. The
AN/SSQ-110A is more exciting and consists of two explosive charges. Each
time an explosive charge detonates, it sends a pulse of sound energy
through the surrounding water. **[These pulses, especially those
bouncing off of enemy submarines, are picked up by the listening
AN/SSQ-101. A]{.underline}**SW hunters would typically drop multiple
AN/SSQ-101s, hopeful that their data could help triangulate an enemy
sub\'s position. The **[newer AN/SSQ-125, which replaces explosive
charges with electronically generated sound, is replacing the
-110A.]{.underline}**

psychological or cognitive operations, as several scholars have
suggested, our analysis of Chinese military investments suggests that
AI's most immediate and profound effects will come from intelligent
munitions, as well as from maintenance and logistics systems that are
already under development. Accordingly, we recommend two lines of effort
to increase the likelihood of U.S. victory in a near-term U.S.-Chinese
war: expanding investment in counter-AI research and adopting zero-trust
architectures for the development of U.S. AI systems.

First, the **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
**[must]{.underline}** **[be prepared to degrade and counter the
People's Liberation]{.underline}** **[Army's]{.underline}** evolving
**[suite of AI systems]{.underline}**. Department of Defense planners
should continue to regulate Chinese access to advanced equipment, data,
and capital to hinder the availability and utility of AI systems. As one
of us found last year, very few of the People's Liberation Army's AI
equipment suppliers are named in U.S. end-user export control lists.
More of them should be. **[Gaps in the U.S. export control framework,
combined with a lack of situational awareness]{.underline}**,
**[continue to allow the Chinese military to access U.S. technology and
capital in pursuit of AI.]{.underline}**

Simultaneously, **[the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[can impose costs on]{.underline}**
AI-reliant **[Chinese forces]{.underline}** **[by embracing
advances]{.underline}** **[in]{.underline}** the fields of
counter-**[AI]{.underline}** and counter-autonomy. In responding to
China's growing AI power, **[it is important for U.S. leaders
to]{.underline}** **[avoid]{.underline}** **[a strategy that is
reactive]{.underline}**, defensively oriented, and which might become
yet another area where the United States is on the wrong side of the
cost curve. **[Counter-autonomy could help to avoid that
outcome]{.underline}**. Specifically, the Department of Defense should
invest more in adversarial machine learning techniques --- finding and
exploiting weaknesses in Chinese AI models by feeding them specific data
inputs. In a 2020 white paper, the Defense Science Board recommended
that the department use counter-autonomy "to defend against increasingly
autonomous systems deployed by adversaries, and to ensure that U.S.
autonomous systems are not vulnerable to adversary countermeasures."
Despite the recommendation, the Department of Defense has not publicly
created a senior counter-autonomy leadership position, nor has it
invested in related research projects or sought to acquire systems
designed specifically to understand and defeat Chinese AI platforms. But
doing so would be crucial to ensure U.S. success in a near-term crisis.

Second, **[the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[should continue to invest in its own AI
capabilities]{.underline}** **[to remain competitive with the People's
Liberation Army]{.underline}**. **[Chinese]{.underline}** military
**[leaders have long recognized their forces' deficiencies in conducting
joint operations]{.underline}** --- **[but U.S. forces]{.underline}**,
too, **[have a]{.underline}** **[long way to go]{.underline}** **[before
they can effectively and reliably operate joint command and
control.]{.underline}** By using AI to intelligently incorporate sensors
from across different services, the United States is more likely to keep
its edge when conducting joint operations. The Department of Defense
should also invest further in intelligent munitions. It has long relied
on large salvos, which quickly deplete the U.S. missile inventory in a
variety of combat scenarios. Successfully fielding intelligent standoff
weapons to curtail this deficiency would be invaluable during a
potential battle with the Chinese military.

challenge too, though swarms could be linked to a support vessel to
recharge and geo-locate. **[Most likely, transparency will grow as these
technologies mature and are fielded at scale. And true transparency may
never occur]{.underline}**. But even a significant reduction of the
ability of submarines to hide poses challenges for nuclear deterrence.

Find, Chase, Kill **[Even in a transparent ocean, states must bring
weapons into range to destroy nuclear submarines to a retaliatory
launch]{.underline}**. **[Submarine warfare comprises three stages:
find, chase, and kill.]{.underline}** Find: Locate an adversary
submarine in the vastness of the ocean. **[Even in a future fully
transparent ocean, finding submarines would not be
trivial]{.underline}**. **[Sensors must be replaced or moved. Drone and
manned searches must be coordinated, platforms maintained, and adversary
countermeasures mitigated]{.underline}**. **[Ocean data must be
collected, stored, and processed.]{.underline}** **[Processing
challenges mean transparency may be significantly
delayed]{.underline}**. States must establish the training, doctrine,
and organizational capability to manage these systems effectively.
Chase: Bring weapon systems within range. Even if an adversary's
nuclear-armed submarine can be located, assets must get close enough to
kill it. Submarines deployed near adversary territory will be easier to
catch, but their range and mobility remain an advantage compared with
land-based missiles and aircraft. Kill: Use weapon systems to cause
sufficient harm to the submarine to disable or destroy it. For nuclear
submarines, kill must occur before the submarine can launch a
retaliatory nuclear strike. Failure means potentially devastating
destruction. Perceived risks of failure may prevent an attempt in the
first place. The framework can be useful at multiple levels. States can
be assessed based on their military's overall ability to find, chase,
and kill adversary submarines and prevent adversaries from doing the
same. The elements of each component are highly interdependent both
within and between the components. For example, find involves linking
numerous, diverse sensor systems together. At the tactical level, the
competition will move fluidly between different components. **[In chase,
antisubmarine forces might: a) lose track of the submarine, shifting
back to find; b) continue following the submarine (continuing chase); or
c) engage, shifting the competition to kill]{.underline}**. Protecting
Deterrence **[The shifting nature of undersea competition demands new
approaches to ensure the sea-based deterrent]{.underline}** and
second-strike remain robust. **[To offset greater ocean transparency
states could:]{.underline}** Move Faster: Designers must improve
submarine speed. Faster submarines make it easier to escape adversary
antisubmarine assets. Because transparency likely will come with
processing and analysis delays, faster submarines create more
uncertainty on the submarine's location. In an actual attack, higher
speeds might enable nuclear submarines to buy enough time to launch a
retaliatory nuclear strike. Shoot Farther: Improve submarine-launched
ballistic-missile range. Increased range allows nuclear submarines to
increase the area over which they can threaten an adversary. Find and
chase would become more difficult. Defenders will find it more difficult
and time-consuming to deploy antisubmarine assets in weapons range.
**[Hide Better:]{.underline}** The various methods of transparency will
create exploitable weaknesses. For example, **[submarines may be
designed to fool machine vision systems; and cyber, electronic, or space
attack could disable detection systems. Similarly, undersea drones could
serve as decoys for nuclear-armed submarines.]{.underline}** Such
"**[sub-sinks" would force the expenditure of more resources to find,
chase, and kill nuclear submarines. An attempted first strike also would
need to devote more nuclear weapons to defeating the submarine-based
deterrent]{.underline}**. An attack on a decoy would give the nuclear
submarine more time to flee or launch a nuclear strike. Fight Harder:
Navies can explore new ways to defend nuclear submarines and counter
antisubmarine capabilities. Drone sub-sinks and other drones may also
help defend nuclear-armed submarines from conventional attack. Drones
could be equipped with defensive antitorpedo systems and offensive
antisubmarine weapons. To ensure nuclear deterrence, defensive systems
only need to create enough survivability to allow a nuclear retaliation.
Investments in information warfare capabilities such as jammers and
directed-energy weapons would also help counter some adversary drone
systems. **[A transparent ocean does not mean the end of a sea-based
second-strike capability]{.underline}**. Every innovation can be
countered. Improvements now can help ensure second-strike remains
reliable into the future.

of submarines, it is developing boats with advanced quieting
capabilities that are "very competitive" with those in the US fleet,
said Hendrix.

"Russia is modernizing its existing fleet of Oscar-class multipurpose

Severodvinsk Yasen-class," US Pacific Command chief Adm. Harry Harris
told the House Armed Services Committee earlier this year.

"The Russians are making a leverage investment ... with submarines you

### 2AC \-\-- Primacy Good

#### nuclear primacy [prevents]{.underline} or [limits the impact]{.underline} of a nuclear war\-\--effective first-strike capability means the U.S. would preempt if China began preparation to launch nukes 

**Lieber and Press 7** -- Keir Lieber, Assistant Professor of Political
Science at the University of Notre Dame, and Daryl Press, Associate
Professor of Government at Dartmouth College, July/August 2007,

http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200707/china-nukes

From a military perspective, this modernization has paid off: [A U.S.
nuclear first strike could]{.underline} **[quickly destroy
China's]{.underline}** strategic **[nuclear arsenal]{.underline}**.
Whether launched in peacetime or during a crisis, a preemptive strike
would likely leave China [**with no means of nuclear retaliation**
against American territory]{.underline}. And given the trends in both
arsenals, China may live under the shadow of U.S. nuclear primacy for
years to come. This assessment is based on unclassified information,
standard targeting principles, and formulas that defense analysts have
used for decades. (And we systematically chose conservative estimates
for key unknowns, meaning that our analysis understates U.S.
counterforce capabilities.) The simplest version of an American
preemptive strike would have nuclear-armed submarines in the Pacific
launch Trident II missiles at the Chinese ICBM field in Henan province.
The Navy keeps at least two of these submarines on "hard alert" in the
Pacific at all times, meaning they're ready to fire within 15 minutes of
a launch order. Since each submarine carries 24 nuclear-tipped missiles
with an average of six warheads per missile, [commanders
have]{.underline} almost [300 warheads ready]{.underline} for immediate
use. This is [more than enough to assign multiple warheads
to]{.underline} each of [the 18 Chinese silos]{.underline}. Chinese
leaders would have little or no warning of the attack. During the Cold
War, U.S. submarines posed little danger to China's silos, or to any
other hardened targets. Each warhead on the Trident I missiles had
little chance---roughly 12 percent---of success. Not only were those
missiles inaccurate, their warheads had a relatively small yield.
(Similarly, until the late 1980s, U.S. ICBMs lacked the accuracy to
carry out a reliable disarming attack against China.) But the Navy's new
warheads and missiles are far more lethal. A Trident II missile is so
accurate, and the newer W88 warhead so powerful, that if the warhead and
missile function normally, the destruction of the silo is virtually
assured (the likelihood is calculated as greater than 99 percent). In
reality, American planners could not assume such near-perfect results.
Some missiles or warheads could malfunction: One missile's rockets might
fail to ignite; another's guidance system might be defective. So a
realistic counterforce plan might assign four warheads to each silo. The
U.S. would "cross-target" the missiles, meaning that the warheads on
each missile would each go to different silos, so that a silo would be
spared only if many missiles malfunctioned. Even assuming that 20
percent of missiles malfunctioned---the standard, conservative
assumption typically used by nuclear analysts---there is a 97 percent
chance that every Chinese DF-5 silo would be destroyed in a 4-on-1
attack. (By comparison, a similar attack using Cold War--era Trident I
missiles would have produced less than a 1 percent chance of success.
The leap in American counterforce capabilities since the end of the Cold
War is staggering.) Beyond bolstering the ability to conduct a first
strike, the [improvements to U.S. counterforce weapons]{.underline} also
allow war planners to design nuclear options that will [make the weapons
more "usable" during]{.underline} high-stakes [crises]{.underline}.
Nuclear planners face many choices when they consider striking a given
target. First, they must choose a warhead yield. The American arsenal
includes low-yield weapons such as the B-61 bomb, which can detonate
with as little explosive force as 0.3 kilotons (one-fiftieth the power
of the bomb that destroyed Hiroshima), and high-yield weapons such as
the B-83 bomb, which can yield 1,200 kilotons (80 times the strength of
the Hiroshima bomb). For a military planner, high-yield weapons are
attractive because they're very likely to destroy the target---even if
the weapon misses by some distance. [Low-yield warheads]{.underline}, on
the other hand, [can be]{.underline} more [discriminating]{.underline},
if planners want [to minimize civilian casualties]{.underline}. A second
key decision for war planners is whether to set the weapon to detonate
at ground level or in the air above the target. A groundburst creates
enormous overpressure and ground shock, ideal for destroying a hardened
target. But groundbursts also create a lot of radioactive fallout. Dirt
and other matter is sucked up into the mushroom cloud, mixes with
radioactive material, and, after being carried by the wind, falls to
earth in the hours after the blast, spreading lethal radiation.
[Airbursts create smaller zones of]{.underline} **[extremely high
overpressure]{.underline}**, [but]{.underline} they also **[generate
very little fallout]{.underline}**. If the detonation occurs above a
threshold altitude (which depends on the weapon yield), virtually no
heavy particles from the ground mix with the radioactive material in the
fireball. The [radioactive material rises into the high
atmosphere]{.underline} and then falls to earth over the course of
several weeks in a far less dangerous state and over a very wide area,
[greatly reducing the harm]{.underline} to civilians. In the past, a
nuclear attack on China's arsenal would have had horrific humanitarian
consequences. The weapons were less accurate, so an effective strike
would have required multiple high-yield warheads, detonating on the
ground, against each target. The Federation of American Scientists and
the Natural Resources Defense Council modeled the consequences of such
an attack---similar to the submarine attack described above---and
published their findings in 2006. The results were sobering. Although
China's long-range missiles are deployed in a lightly populated region,
lethal fallout from an attack would travel hundreds of miles and kill
more than 3 million Chinese civilians. American leaders might have
contemplated such a strike, but only in the most dire circumstances. But
things are changing radically. Improved accuracy now allows war planners
to target hardened sites with low-yield warheads and even airbursts. And
the United States is pushing its breakthroughs in accuracy even further.
For example, for many years America has used global-positioning systems
in conjunction with onboard inertial-guidance systems to improve the
accuracy of its conventionally armed (that is, nonnuclear) cruise
missiles. Although an adversary may jam the GPS signal near likely
targets, the cruise missiles use GPS along their flight route and
then---if they lose the signal---use their backup inertial-guidance
system for the final few kilometers. This approach has dramatically
improved a cruise missile's accuracy and could be applied to nuclear-
armed cruise missiles as well. The United States is deploying jam-
resistant GPS receivers on other weapons, experimenting with GPS on its
nuclear-armed ballistic missiles, and planning to deploy a new
generation of GPS satellites---with higher-powered signals to complicate
jamming. The payoff for equipping cruise missiles (or nuclear bombs)
with GPS is clear when one estimates the civilian casualties from a
lower-yield, airburst attack. We asked Matthew McKinzie, a scientific
consultant to the Natural Resources Defense Council and coauthor of the
2006 study, to rerun the analysis using low-yield detonations compatible
with nuclear weapons currently in the U.S. arsenal. Using three warheads
per target to increase the odds of destroying every silo, the model
predicts fewer than 1,000 Chinese casualties from fallout. In some
low-yield scenarios, fewer than 100 Chinese would be killed or injured
from fallout. The model is better suited to predicting fallout
casualties than to forecasting deaths from the blast and fire, but given
the low population in the rural region where the silos are, **[Chinese
fatalities would be fewer than 6,000 in even the most destructive
scenario]{.underline}** we modeled. And in the future, there may be
reliable nonnuclear options for destroying Chinese silos. Freed from the
burden of killing millions, a U.S. president staring at the threat of a
Chinese nuclear attack on U.S. forces, allies, or territory might be
more inclined to choose preemptive action. Strategic Implications of the
Nuclear Imbalance **[The most plausible flash point]{.underline}** for a
serious U.S.-China conflict [is Taiwan]{.underline}. Suppose Taiwan
declared independence. China has repeatedly warned that such a move
would provoke an attack, probably a major air and naval campaign to
shatter Taiwan's defenses and leave the island vulnerable to conquest.
If the United States decided to defend Taiwan, American forces would
likely thwart China's offensive, since aerial and naval warfare are
strengths of the U.S. military. But looming defeat would place great
pressure on China's leaders. [Losing the war might mean]{.underline}
permanently **[losing Taiwan]{.underline}**. [This would]{.underline}
[undermine the]{.underline} domestic legitimacy of the
**[C]{.underline}**hinese **[C]{.underline}**ommunist
**[P]{.underline}**arty, which increasingly relies on the appeal of
nationalism to justify its rule. A crippling defeat would also strain
relations between political leaders in Beijing and the Chinese military.
To stave off a regime-threatening disaster, the political [leaders
might]{.underline} decide to [raise the stakes by placing]{.underline}
part of [the]{.underline} Chinese **[nuclear force on
alert]{.underline}** in hopes of coercing the United States into
accepting a negotiated solution (for example, a return to Taiwan's
pre-declaration status). **[By putting its]{.underline}** nuclear
**[forces on alert]{.underline}**, however, **[China]{.underline}**'s
leaders **[would compel a]{.underline}** U.S. **[president
to]{.underline}** make a very difficult decision: to accede to blackmail
(by agreeing to a cease-fire and pressuring the Taiwanese to renounce
independence), to assume that the threat is a bluff (a dangerous
proposition, given that each Chinese ICBM carries a city-busting
4,000-kiloton warhead), or to **[strike the Chinese missiles before they
could be launched]{.underline}**. How do America's growing counterforce
capabilities affect this scenario? First, American [nuclear primacy may
prevent such a war]{.underline} in the first place. China's leaders
understand that their military now has little hope of defeating U.S. air
and naval forces. If they also recognize that their nuclear arsenal is
vulnerable---and that placing it on alert might trigger a preemptive
strike---the leaders may conclude that war is a no-win proposition.
Second, **[if a war]{.underline}** over Taiwan **[started
anyway]{.underline}**, U.S. [nuclear primacy might help **contain the
fighting at the conventional level.**]{.underline} Early in the crisis,
**[Washington could]{.underline}** quietly **[convey to
Beijing]{.underline}** that **[the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[would act decisively if China put
its]{.underline}** vulnerable **[nuclear arsenal on
alert]{.underline}**. Finally, if China threatened to launch nuclear
attacks against America's allies, its territory, or its forces in Asia,
nuclear **[primacy would make a preemptive first strike more palatable
to U.S. leaders]{.underline}**. Any decision to attack China's ICBM
force, though, would be fraught with danger. A missile silo might have
escaped detection. Furthermore, a strike on China's 18 ICBMs would leave
Beijing with roughly 60 shorter-range nuclear missiles with which to
retaliate against U.S. forces and allies in the region. However, in the
aftermath of a "clean" disarming strike---one that killed relatively few
Chinese---American leaders could credibly warn that a Chinese nuclear
response would trigger truly devastating consequences, meaning nuclear
attacks against a broader target set, including military, government,
and possibly even urban centers. [In light of]{.underline} **[warnings
from Chinese defense analysts]{.underline}** and from within China's
military **[that it might use nuclear weapons to avoid losing
Taiwan]{.underline}**, [a]{.underline}n American [president
might]{.underline} **[feel compelled to strike first]{.underline}**. In
this terrible circumstance, he or she would reap the benefits of the
past decade's counterforce upgrades.

While the U.S. is ahead of China, Russia and other adversaries,
deliberate and **[holistic efforts]{.underline}** **[must be undertaken

Google and Microsoft Corp. said.

"**[We are ahead]{.underline}**. **[We're losing ground]{.underline}**,"
Andrew Moore, director of Google Cloud AI, said during a May 3 hearing
of a Senate Armed Services cyber subcommittee. "I'm most worried about
our structures. Bringing in massive-scale, superhuman automation means
changing organizational structures and change management."

Eric Horvitz, Microsoft's chief scientific officer, offered similar
guidance.

"The U.S. is leading in science, at the core principles and the creative
applications, from my point of view," he told the panel. "That said,
these days technical advances spread around the world like lightning."

The **[Department of Defense]{.underline}** late last year **[created

Lyft's machine-learning executive --- will oversee the Joint Artificial
Intelligence Center, Defense Digital Service and the agency's chief data
officer, and will report directly to the deputy defense secretary. The
office is expected to be fully operational this year.

Moore applauded the move Tuesday and wished Martell success.

"**[This is how we're going to succeed, by having a centralized effort
to put an artificial intelligence strategy across the whole
DoD]{.underline}**," he said. "You cannot just magic AI on top of
existing systems**[. You have to think about how you're going to change
operations]{.underline}**."

Moving forward, Horvitz said, there is a need to "get our hands dirty
and work hard and then share ideas, insights, across the sectors."
Integrating scientific achievements into the Defense Department's
day-to-day routines will be crucial.

"We often think about AI ... as on the battlefield, as kinetics,"
Horvitz said. "But DoD is a huge operation, in peacetime and in war. The
logistics, planning, predictive models, employment, back to health care,
the VA system --- all can benefit greatly by even basic applications of
machine learning, predictions, diagnoses and planning."

**[The Pentagon recognizes the value of AI and is actively pursuing and
investing in it. Some, though, believe it's moving too slowly or with
incorrect priority.]{.underline}**

"Make no mistake, **[our adversaries will]{.underline}** **[capitalize
on this technology, using AI to power attacks on our networks as well as
increasing their ability to detect our intrusions on their networks and
to respond quickly]{.underline}**," Sen. Joe **[Manchin]{.underline}**,
the West Virginia Democrat who heads the subcommittee, said **[at the

continued, "**[would be]{.underline}** **[disastrous]{.underline}**."

A **[Defense Department]{.underline}** assessment from 2018 **[warned
that China and Russia are spending significant sums of money on AI for
military applications]{.underline}**. The investment threatens to erode
U.S. technological and operational advantages, according to the

"Put simply," Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., said at the hearing, "our

WASHINGTON, DC (Sept. 24, 2021) -- Today, Congressman Joe Courtney
(CT-02), Chairman of the House Armed Services Subcommittee
on Seapower and Projection Forces, voted to pass the Fiscal Year 2022
**[National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) (H.R. 4350) in the House of
Representatives. The House-passed NDAA]{.underline}** supports
servicemembers and their families, would protect and strengthen
America's global alliances, and includes **[historic support for
shipbuilding and submarine construction and
procurement]{.underline}**---the most since the 1980's. The bill
received **[bipartisan support]{.underline}** in the House of
Representatives, and was passed today by a **[vote
of 316-113. ]{.underline}**

"At a time when **[America's national security priorities continue to
shift towards the maritime domain]{.underline}**---a necessity
underscored just recently by the historic new AUKUS alliance---our 2022
NDAA is exactly what's needed to ensure we're prepared to overcome
tomorrow's challenges," said Rep. Courtney. "The decisions made in this
bill are not random -- it is the **[result of months of focused and
bipartisan review of the budget and the needs of our
nation.]{.underline}** **[One of the most urgent needs facing Congress
and the administration is the expansion of our Navy fleet to meet the
looming challenges around the world.]{.underline}** Shipbuilding is a
long game that requires a stable and clear outlook -- and this bill
provides a strong starting point for fleet size deliberations moving
forward."

"It's no wonder then that this **[bill focuses so much on boosting our
naval and maritime fleets]{.underline}** and, in particular, our
**[submarine capabilities]{.underline}**," Courtney added. "Building on
a budget request that represented the **[largest combined investment in
submarine procumbent and development in recent history]{.underline}**,
the NDAA goes even further by taking the initial and needed steps needed
to expand submarine production. The expansion of the shipyard, the new
submarines being built by our skilled workers, the increase in work up
and down our eastern Connecticut supply chain---the **[NDAA is the
foundation of that activity]{.underline}** and will help keep it going
strong.

"We've got more work ahead until our 2022 NDAA becomes final, and as
Chairman of the Seapower Subcommittee I'll continue working with my
colleagues on both sides of the aisle---and on both sides of the Capitol
building---to send it to President Biden's desk."

Earlier this month, the House Armed Services Committee voted 57-2 to
authorize the 2022 NDAA for final consideration. [Click

Eastern Connecticut Priorities included in the 2022 NDAA

**[Submarines and Undersea Capabilities]{.underline}** --- The
House-passed NDAA provides a total of \$13.4 billion for submarine
procurement, repair, research & development priorities including: 

Virginia-class Submarine -- supports the sustained two-per-year build
rate of new Virginia-class submarines in 2022 and beyond, continuing the
Block V multi-year contract and reflecting Courtney's bipartisan work to
preserve the two a year build rate. The bill also authorizes \$567
million to allow the Navy to support shipyard facility and industrial
base improvements to enable future increases in Virginia class submarine
production from two to three by 2025, a long-time priority of Chairman
Courtney's. 

Columbia-class Submarine -- fully supports the second year of funding
for the first Columbia class submarine and supports advanced procurement
to support the second, in line with the contract announced in June 2020.
The bill includes a Courtney-authored provision providing \$200 million
to continue efforts to improve the nationwide submarine supplier base. 
Also included in the bill is a provision Courtney authored to expand the
National Sea-Based Deterrence Fund (NSBDF) to extend continuing
production authority to additional components of the new submarine,
increasing production efficiency and reducing costs. Recent data from
the Navy shows through the use of this authority has saved \$1.4 billion
in the Columbia program to the tune of over \$100 million per boat.  

**[Research and Development of
Future Submarine Capabilities]{.underline}**-- the bill includes
**[\$949 million in research and development of future submarine
capabilities]{.underline}**, including a **[\$150 million increase for
developing capabilities for the next block of submarines]{.underline}**,
and about \$30 million to develop the SSN(X), the planned future
follow-on to the Virginia-class. These efforts are vital to sustaining
the health of the design and engineering workforce at Electric Boat.   

USS Hartford repair availability -- the bill fully authorizes the budget
request of \$710 million to support the remainder of the maintenance
availability for the USS Hartford in 2022. In June, the Navy awarded the
"smart start" contract to Groton's Electric Boat (EB) for initial
maintenance work on the boat, one of the largest submarine maintenance
availabilities ever executed by the yard. [Click

learn more. 

The bill also includes other Courtney-led provisions to augment undersea
priorities such as: 

Academic Partnerships for Undersea Research -- The bill authorizes
**[\$25 million to support partnerships with academic institutions
conducting research on undersea capabilities]{.underline}**, such as the
National Institute for Undersea Vehicle Technology, a collaborative
program between the University of Connecticut and the University of
Rhode Island.   

**[Submarine Workforce Development]{.underline}** -- Authorizes \$20
million to support training programs to help support expansion of the
skilled submarine workforce as the industrial base ramps up construction
of new submarines. Courtney has strongly supported workforce development
efforts in the region to support hiring at Electric Boat and the supply
chain through programs like the Eastern Connecticut Manufacturing
Pipeline. 

**[Remote Acoustic Sensors]{.underline}** -- The bill included a
Courtney-authored provision to **[allocate \$20 million towards
supporting operational testing of unmanned remote acoustic sensor
systems]{.underline}**, which will help the Navy evaluate existing
off-the-shelf platforms like those developed by Groton's ThayerMahan.

mimou\]

WASHINGTON -- Today, after months of unnecessary delays, U.S. Senator
Todd Young (R-Ind.) voted to approve the **[bipartisan National Defense
Authorization Act (NDAA). The bill passed by a vote of
89-10]{.underline}** and included provisions that will benefit our
military and make Americans safer and more secure.

"While Democrats haggled over their reckless tax-and-spend proposal,
this vital defense bill has been on the back burner receiving little
attention. Though it's later than it should have been, the version we
passed today is far better than President Biden's original plan. It
gives our troops a pay raise and puts **[real resources behind
countering the aggressive actions of Putin's Russia and the Chinese
Communist Party]{.underline}**.  

"I'm proud to have secured several key provisions in this bill,
including provisions to strengthen cybersecurity cooperation with
Israel, **[invest in emerging technologies]{.underline}**, and create a
bipartisan commission to examine our two decades of war in Afghanistan.
The bill also includes a plan I worked on with members of the Burmese
community in Indiana to support the restoration of democracy in
Burma," said Senator Young.

As passed, this NDAA gives our troops a 2.7 percent pay raise and
provides a 3 percent increase over the previous year's military budget.
This increase is more for our military than President Biden's proposal,
which would have slashed defense spending. This increase is critical to
keep pace with the Chinese Communist Party which has averaged ranged
between 7.2 percent and 8.1 percent increases in year-over-year growth
since 2016.

Senator Young, a U.S. Naval Academy graduate and Marine who serves on
the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, worked to ensure the bill
would strengthen our military, while keeping Americans safe amidst
threats from coronavirus, Russia, and the Chinese Communist Party. 

The NDAA was also a success for keeping liberal priorities out of the
final bill. The compromise legislation rejected distractions that would
have impacted the rights of Hoosier gun owners and would have required
women to register for the draft. 

Four of Senator Young's national security priorities were included in
the legislation.

Senator Young's provisions in the NDAA:

[The Afghanistan War Commission
Act](https://www.young.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/young-duckworth-effort-to-create-independent-afghanistan-war-commission-gains-bipartisan-support-in-the-senate) to
establish a 16-member nonpartisan commission to examine military,
diplomatic and intelligence activities by the U.S. from late 1996 to the
withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan in August. This is
essential as we examine our two decades at war and our failed withdrawal
from Afghanistan.

U.S.-Israel Cybersecurity Cooperation Enhancement to establish a
Department of Homeland Security grant program to facilitate closer
U.S.-Israel cybersecurity cooperation.

**[Pilot program on acquisition practices for emerging
technologies]{.underline}** to bring the themes of Senator
Young's [Endless Frontier
Act](https://www.young.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/chinese-communist-party-lobbies-against-senator-youngs-endless-frontier-act) into
the Department of Defense. This requires the Department to identify and
award no less than four agreements for new projects to **[support high
priority modernization activities]{.underline}** that are consistent
with the National Defense Strategy and creates an advisory group to
bring private sector expertise into the process.

Support Democracy in Burma, a bipartisan amendment that was drafted with
the input of leaders from across the Burmese community in an effort to
restore democracy and hold those responsible accountable following this
year's coup. This amendment requires the U.S. government to examine
supporting the National Unity Government, denying legitimacy for the
junta, and the role sanctions could play in accountability.

Senator Young also secured the following provisions in support of
Indiana projects:

**[Anti-Submarine Warfare Equipment:]{.underline}**

As the **[United States engages in strategic competition]{.underline}**,
our Navy will be at the **[forefront of securing vital sea
lanes]{.underline}**, protecting commerce, and **[reducing threats to
the homeland from the navies of China and Russia. Sonobuoys, like those
manufactured by Ultra Electronics in Columbia City, Indiana, are a vital
tool in detecting and tracking submarine threats from our peer
competitors]{.underline}**. Senator Young **[secured a 20% increase in
funding to procure additional sonobuoys.]{.underline}** Persistent
Maritime Intelligence Gathering:

Senator Young also secured funding support for two additional MQ-4C
Triton drones, reversing the Biden Administration's decision to not
procure this aircraft. The Triton provides **[long-range intelligence,
surveillance, reconnaissance, and targeting capabilities over vast
oceans spaces.]{.underline}** As the United States seeks to **[deter
against China in the Pacific]{.underline}**, this airborne capability
will be invaluable in monitoring China's deployments of ships and
aircraft. Rolls-Royce produces the engines for the Triton in
Indianapolis, Indianapolis.

Speaking on a panel about AI superpowers at the Politico AI Summit, Nand
Mulchandani **[said AI is a very large technology]{.underline}** and
industry. \"It\'s **[not a single, monolithic
technology]{.underline}**,\" he said. \"**[It\'s a collection of
algorithms, technologies, etc.,]{.underline}** all cobbled together to
call AI.\"

The United States has access to global datasets, **[and that\'s why
global partnerships are so incredibly important]{.underline}**, he said,
**[noting the Defense Department launched the AI partnership for defense
at the JAIC recently]{.underline}** to have access to global datasets
with partners, which gives DOD a natural advantage in building these
systems at scale.

\"Industry has to develop on its own, and that\'s where the global
talent is; that\'s where the money is; that\'s where all of the
innovation is going on,\" Mulchandani noted, adding that the U.S.
government\'s job is to be able to work in the best way and absorb the
best technology that it can. That includes working hand in glove with
industry on a voluntary basis, he said.\
    \
He said **[there are certain areas of AI that are highly
scaled]{.underline}** that you can trust and deploy at scale.

\"**[But]{.underline}** notice many or **[not many of those systems have
been deployed on weapon systems]{.underline}**. **[We actually don\'t
have any of them deployed,]{.underline}**\" he said.

Mulchandani said **[the reason is that]{.underline}** explainability,
testing, trust and ethics are all highly connected pieces and even AI
security when it comes to model security, data security being able to
penetrate and break models. This is all very early, which is why the DOD
and the U.S. government widely have taken a very stringent approach to
putting together the ethics principles and frameworks within which
we\'re going to operate.

\"\[Earlier this year, **[one of the first international visits that we
made were to [NATO](https://www.nato.int/) and our European
partners]{.underline}**, **[and \[we\] then pulled them
into]{.underline}** this **[AI partnership for defense]{.underline}**
that I just talked about,\" he said. \"Thirteen different countries are
getting together to actually build these principles because we actually
do need to build a lot of confidence in this.\"

**[DOD loves larger budgets for AI]{.underline}**, Mulchandani said,
**[and there\'s been incredible bipartisan support for it with the JAIC
and all its other investments]{.underline}**. \"**[But]{.underline}**
**[in aggregate as a society]{.underline}** or a country, **[our models
are very different]{.underline}**, which is \[why\] you have to look at
all of the venture capital \[and\] all of the investment going in both
in existing companies but also in new companies in AI.\"

He said DOD continues to attract and have the best talent at JAIC.\
\"**[The real tricky part is]{.underline}**: How do we actually take
that technology and get it deployed? That\'s the **[complexity of
integrating AI into existing systems]{.underline}**, because one isn\'t
going to throw away the entire investment of legacy systems that one
has, whether it be software or hardware or even military hardware,\"
Mulchandani said. \"\[How\] can we absorb the best of what\'s coming and
get it integrated into the system as where the complexity is?\"

### Plan is cheap

#### Orca thumps and proves it's cheap

**Middendorf 21** -- Hon. J. William Middendorf has served a number of
presidential administrations in high-level positions, including
Secretary of the Navy and Ambassador to the European Communities, the
Organization of American States, and the Netherlands. (Hon. J. William
Middendorf Ii, \"Meet the U.S. Navy's Unmanned Ships of the Future,\"

Accessed 7-3-2022, LASA-SC)

How much **[Orca]{.underline}** will improve upon the technology already
inside Echo Voyager is unknown. U.S. Naval Institute News reports that
Orca **[will be capable of]{.underline}** **[mine
countermeasures]{.underline}**,
**[a]{.underline}**nti-**[s]{.underline}**ubmarine
**[w]{.underline}**arfare, **[anti-surface warfare]{.underline}**,
**[and]{.underline}** **[strike missions.]{.underline}** **[Orca could
carry sonar payloads, detect enemy submarines, and send location data to
friendly helicopters and surface ships.]{.underline}**

Orca could even pack MK-46 lightweight torpedoes or MK-48 heavyweight
torpedoes to attack submarines and surface ships. **[It would even carry
anti-ship missiles]{.underline}**. It can also be used to drop off
cargoes on the seabed, such as sensors, to detect or lay mines to impede
shipping. The modular payload system and open architecture software
ensure Orca could be rapidly configured based on need.

**[This sort of versatility in a single, low-cost package]{.underline}**
**[is]{.underline}** at this point **[unheard of]{.underline}** **[in
military spending]{.underline}**. The nearest rough equivalent is the
\$584 million Littoral Combat Ship, which requires a crew of forty.
While the LCS is faster and carries a larger payload, the **[autonomous
Orca]{.underline}** **[is]{.underline}** **[cheaper]{.underline}** **[by
orders of magnitude]{.underline}**.

For missions such as anti-submarine warfare, dozens of
**[cheaper]{.underline}** **[Orcas]{.underline}** **[could saturate an
area, potentially a far more effective strategy than that provided by a
single surface ship or a manned submarine]{.underline}**. Several Orcas
could be controlled by a single shore-based crew, allowing the
autonomous submarines to operate independently for days or even weeks at
a time.

Another benefit of unmanned **[submersibles]{.underline}** is that they
**[are]{.underline}** **[more or less disposable]{.underline}** **[and
able to operate in dangerous waters without risking human
lives]{.underline}**. Orca could pretend to be a full-size submarine;
waiting for an enemy submarine to take a shot while a real
Virginia-class nuclear-powered attack submarine sits back, waiting to
ambush it. Orca could take on the most dangerous missions, such as
laying mines in heavily defended waters. They would be leaving behind a
deadly surprise for enemies convinced that mine laying in their waters
is simply too dangerous for manned submarines.

It is still not known whether an Orca system can become a full-fledged
part of the fleet, although the **[Navy's purchase of four indicates
that there are plans for using them for real-world
missions]{.underline}**. The Navy may be purchasing enough to continue
testing while having a few on hand for actual use. **[Inexpensive
systems]{.underline}** **[like Orca could go a long way towards one of
the most understated promises of unmanned air, land, and sea drones:
reversing the out-of-control costs of today's weapons
systems.]{.underline}**

#### EU fails \-\-- AI commercialization of tech and adoption isn't fast enough to solve or ensure interop \-\-- need U.S. action

**Christie '22**

(E. H. Christie, Finnish Institute of International Affairs, "Defence
cooperation in artificial intelligence: Bridging the transatlantic gap
for a stronger Europe," European View 2022, Vol. 21(1) 13 --2 //um-ef)

Before proceeding, **[it is worth spelling out the extent to which
European security is dependent on NATO]{.underline}** **[and in
particular on the US]{.underline}**. **[Of the EU's 27 member states, 21
are members of NATO]{.underline}**. **[These countries account for about
93% of the population1 of the EU.]{.underline}** Christie 15 **[Within
NATO, those Allies that are also EU members only account for about 20%
of total defence expenditure across the Alliance]{.underline}**,
**[while the US alone accounts for about 70%]{.underline}** of the same
total.2 Beyond these aggregate indicators, **[it is furthermore the case
that the US is considerably ahead of the EU in terms of practical
adoption of AI.]{.underline}** For illustration, in 2020 US
private-sector investment in AI was around \$23.6 billion, but was only
\$2 billion in the EU, implying a ratio of 12 to 1 in favour of the US
(Zhang et al. 2021, 96). Scientific output indicators offer a more
nuanced picture. In 2019, the EU accounted for 16.4% of the world's
peer-reviewed AI publications, ahead of the US with 14.6%, while China
occupied the top spot with 22.4% (Zhang et al. 2021, 20). On the other
hand, if one measures research output in terms of publications on the
Arxiv database, the US is ahead of the EU (Zhang et al. 2021, 33) by a
ratio of almost two to one, which is nonetheless much less than the
large gap in private investment mentioned above. **[That the EU performs
similarly to the US in terms of scientific research, but far less well
in terms of investment and commercialisation of new digital
technologies, is an old problem which has proven very difficult to
address,]{.underline}** whether at national or EU level (Baroudy et al.
2020). In the following sections, I offer reflections on three challenge
areas for European and A**[llied defence institutions: interoperability
challenges, international security challenges and investment
challenges.]{.underline}** These three challenges **[are effectively
interdependent]{.underline}**. While **[interoperability is a permanent
goal in an alliance context, be it NATO or the EU, it is particularly
salient]{.underline}** in cases of rapid technological change, such as
**[with AI]{.underline}**, **[as there is a need for a higher tempo
across areas of activity]{.underline}**. Heightened international
security challenges likewise increase the need for urgency to ensure
that Western nations do not fall behind potential adversaries.
Investment, in turn, is the engine for rapid change, enabling the
dynamic adoption of new technologies, relevant capability-development
activities and other adaptations along the value chain of military
activities. Overall, my central argument is that th**[e confluence of
rapid technological change and heightened international security
challenges requires a higher pace of change and adaptation that can only
succeed if serious investments are made on both sides of the
Atlantic]{.underline}**

#### interoperability isn't a buzzword \-\-- without harmonization throughout the development process, breakthroughs are impossible \-\-- the U.S. must be *[DIRECTLY]{.underline}* involved to overcome gaps in capabilities 

**Christie '22**

(E. H. Christie, Finnish Institute of International Affairs, "Defence
cooperation in artificial intelligence: Bridging the transatlantic gap
for a stronger Europe," European View 2022, Vol. 21(1) 13 --2 //um-ef)

**[Interoperability can be defined as 'the ability of systems, units or
forces to provide services to, and accept services from other systems,
units or forces and the use the services so exchanged to enable them to
operate effectively together']{.underline}** (Dufour 2018, 1). The
**[first general challenge to interoperability is the]{.underline}**
**[overall gap]{.underline}** **[between the US and Europe in terms of
total defence investment, as well as]{.underline}** in terms of
**[civilian tech]{.underline}**nological **[attainment with respect to
AI and related technologies]{.underline}**. There is no single solution
to this problem, which is much broader in scope than traditional
military--technical standards, such as those pursued in the NATO context
through existing mechanisms. For this broad challenge, **[overall policy
decisions relating to national investment choices and technology policy
coordination between the two sides of the Atlantic are of particular
importance]{.underline}**. Further discussion of this follows in the
sections on investment challenges and international security
challenges.16 **[European View]{.underline}** 21(1) A second challenge
to interoperability is that, as far as digital technologies are
concerned, the civilian sector of the economy, on both sides of the
Atlantic, is more advanced, more dynamic and also not especially
oriented towards meeting military needs. **[For decades, the military
sector has represented only a very small share of the total sales volume
of the computing and semiconductor industries. The same pattern is
repeating itself currently with AI]{.underline}**. This stands in great
contrast to narrower dual-use technologies, for example aerospace, where
the military sector remains inherently important. **[With digital
technologies, defence institutions are under much more pressure to
either adapt to civilian industry products and standards or to pay a
significant premium to suppliers to secure military-grade equipment and
software.]{.underline}** **[A third challenge to interoperability lies
in how AI is implemented in practice]{.underline}**. **[To set up a
bespoke machine-learning algorithm in a given data environment, best
practice in the software industry is to pursue some variant of 'agile'
development]{.underline}**. **[This involves a very different
product-development cycle, essentially proceeding with multiple rapid
iterations of an imperfect product that is released in preliminary
versions and later revised---like software products released in various
'beta versions'---with upgrades developed over time]{.underline}**.
**[This contrasts greatly with the traditional production of major
military platforms, which puts a premium on strict quality control and
compliance with requirements at every development step---an approach
referred to in the software industry as 'waterfall'
development]{.underline}** (Christie 2021b, 87). **[Agile product
development may pose challenges to interoperability]{.underline}**.
**[Unless very tight standards are applied]{.underline}**, **[there is a
considerable risk of divergences]{.underline}** **[in how different
national institutions go about solving a particular AI or data analytics
problem]{.underline}**. **[With large traditional military platforms
there are long time frames during which states can take coordination
steps, either by purchasing the same platforms, or by building consensus
in terms of requirements and standards]{.underline}**. **[However, when
a comparatively small team works dynamically to generate an algorithmic
solution to a particular problem in a matter of weeks or months,
traditional coordination through existing consultation mechanisms may
pose risks to the speed advantage inherent to agile
development.]{.underline}** Conversely, once a solution has been
developed, its adoption in somewhat different environments may be
challenging for a range of technical reasons. **[None of these issues is
insurmountable, but they do pose, in a new light, classical trade-offs
between the benefits of inventiveness and dynamism, on the one hand, and
those of imposing constraints through standards and other harmonising
measures to ensure that new products can be broadly used and shared on
the other.]{.underline}** **[In the case of AI, a typical observation is
that there are many excellent prototypes and pilot projects in numerous
defence institutions, but there are also serious outstanding challenges
in terms of scaling up to enterprise-wide solutions, let alone
Alliance-wide solutions]{.underline}**.

47\. **[NATO faces a]{.underline}** **[twin problem]{.underline}**. For
one, **[its own]{.underline}** **[ASW capabilities]{.underline}**
**[have withered]{.underline}**, as the number of ASW-capable platforms
has fallen, in some areas radically. Moreover, **[the capabilities the
Alliance still possesses are rapidly ageing and encounter
interoperability problems]{.underline}** (Hicks et al., 2016). At the
same time, **[the submarine capabilities of near-peer competitors have
increased significantly]{.underline}**, **[even if they cannot best the
most modern Allied submarines]{.underline}**. 48. Several reasons
explain but do not excuse this state of affairs. As the immediate threat
of the Soviet Union waned in the early 1990s, defence budgets began to
shrink substantially. They took another big hit after the financial
crisis of 2007/2008. More importantly perhaps, a strategic reorientation
towards expeditionary warfare took place after the Cold War ended. While
based on sound reasons, this reorientation came at a high price for
other capability areas, including ASW (Perkins, 2016; Allport, 2018;
Hudson and Roberts, 2018): - naval vessels conducted more and more
generic maritime security or were repurposed for land attack missions; -
MPAs increasingly focused on wider intelligence, surveillance, and
reconnaissance; - ASW-capable vessels almost ceased operating in the
North Atlantic and Arctic Oceans; and - some Allies chose not to replace
certain capabilities at the end of their lifetime. 49. One area where
Allies have retained robust capabilities, including through timely
replacement programmes, is maritime ASW helicopters. **[Acoustic
detection systems installed]{.underline}** on the seabed or on shore

**[Whatever happened to Jonesy?]{.underline}**

**[An [ocean]{.mark} that is [suffused with sensors]{.mark} above and
below the surface and which has [sub-tracking robots]{.mark} on the
prowl is [certainly]{.mark} a more [inhospitable]{.mark} place for a
submarine]{.underline}**---or at least, for one that does not belong to
America or one of its allies. **[Flooding the world's oceans with such
sensors is [something only a great power can do.]{.mark}]{.underline}**
As far as most people are concerned, says Mr Cote, "the oceans are
opaque, and will probably remain so."

Changing this would require some new technique to supplement what is
available, and **[there is lots of [research on]{.mark} detecting
[magnetic disturbances and]{.mark} very]{.underline}**, **[[faint
wakes]{.mark} sniffing out telltale [chemicals]{.mark} or
[radiation]{.mark}, and [pinging targets with lasers]{.mark} tuned to

Some of **[these techniques might work best underwater.]{.underline}**
Pictures of curious appendages that might hold sensors of various sorts
on submarines coming into or leaving port reliably spark discussion in
the sub-curious parts of the internet. **[Others could be deployed from
[aerial drones]{.mark}, and thus could be used a lot more if such drones
became more numerous.]{.underline}** But **[[short ranges]{.mark} look
likely to [remain a problem]{.mark} for all these methods, [as
does]{.mark} the fundamental challenge of [separating signal from noise

And **[[submariners could fight back]{.underline}]{.mark}**, notes David
Blagden of the University of Exeter. A submarine leaving port **[might
"[delouse]{.mark}" itself of [inquisitive usvs]{.mark} by using
technology as rudimentary as a tugboat and rope netting. [Should wake

seas]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The **[[low-power transmissions]{.mark}
from usvs to satellites or nearby warships could be [jammed]{.mark} by
other usvs, or by drones.]{.underline}**

**[The last of those tactics speaks to a perennial problem for

[on]{.mark}.]{.underline}** **[[Sensors]{.underline}]{.mark}** which

The U**[.S. military is falling short in developing and implementing
crucial data collection]{.underline}**, **[artificial intelligence and
machine learning capabilities,]{.underline}** the head of Northcom said
April 25. The U**[.S. military continues to deploy new sensors,
satellites and other technologies to collect and produce
data]{.underline}**, and **[that in turn]{.underline}** **[requires more
computing power]{.underline}** **[to process volumes of
information]{.underline}**. "Candidly, **[we're not moving fast
enough]{.underline}** for me," said Air Force Gen. Glen VanHerck,
commander of North American Aerospace Defense Command during a Defense
Writers Group event. The **[military currently processes 2 percent of
the data it collects]{.underline}**, VanHerck said. "We can't apply what
I say are industrial age, industrial base processes to software-driven
capabilities in today's environment," he added. Northcom and industry
partners are working on a program called Pathfinder, which would allow
the military to process 100 percent of the data it collects through the
use of artificial intelligence, he continued. **[Artificial intelligence
and machine learning are crucial to achieving "information dominance,"
so that the military has information sooner to share with allies and
partners]{.underline}**, VanHerck said. The Air Force conducted three
"Global Information Dominance Experiments" last year. The exercises
demonstrated that the military could leverage emerging data analysis to
give leaders more time to react to threats, according to an Air Force
press release. "That Global Information Dominance Experiment has
demonstrated that today, the capability exists, if you share the data,
to utilize the machines to learn," VanHerck said during the
conversation. "Machines that can start counting numbers and tell you
when there's changes in vehicles...vehicles in a parking lot, vehicles
in a weapons storage area. "And then it can actually take and slew
sensors to that and give you an alert to \[notify you\] to look at this
location," he continued. VanHerck voiced similar criticisms of the slow
progress of the Defense Department's adoption of artificial intelligence
and machine learning last year when he spoke with the Center for
Strategic and International Studies. Since then, the Defense Department
has taken steps aimed to address its long-standing difficulties in
processing data. Late last year, Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen
Hicks issued a memo establishing a Chief Digital and Artificial
Intelligence Officer, whose office would replace the Joint Artificial
Intelligence Center created in 2018. An April 25 Defense Department
press release announced the appointment of Dr. Craig Martell ---
previously head of machine learning at Lyft --- as the Chief Digital and
Artificial Intelligence Officer. "**[Advances in AI and machine learning
are critical to delivering the capabilities we need to address key
challenges both today and into the future]{.underline}**," said Hicks in
the release.

[Reliable and repeatable submerges [submarine]{.mark} wake [detection
is]{.mark} a [challenging]{.mark} task]{.underline}, [primarily [due
to]{.mark} the enormous [variability of ocean surface]{.mark}
conditions]{.underline}. With increasingly high sea states[, a radar
attempting to image from a shallow grazing angle will have to confront
wave troughs and peaks, which will [disrupt the wake pattern and
shadow]{.mark}]{.underline}, on average, half of the pattern. [Not only
must the radar do a good job of capturing the surface image
but]{.underline} the post-processing demands of [[finding the
specific]{.mark} shape of a wake [pattern]{.mark} in a very noisy radar
image of the sea surface [are]{.mark} quite
[difficult]{.mark}]{.underline}, typically using a Hough transform or
Radon transform algorithm, both of which require a lot of computing
power. While wake detection [[using SAR even under optimal
conditions]{.mark} may result in a highlight accurate track of the
wake]{.underline}, **[[the delay between the production of the wake and
its contact with the surface adds]{.mark} a considerable amount of
[uncertainty]{.mark}]{.underline}** [as [to]{.mark} the immediate
[position of the submarine]{.mark}]{.underline} being tracked, unless it
is running very shallow. While the shape of the wake front could be used
to infer the distance and the depth of the submarine, for submarines
running deep wake detection [radars may well become primarily a
'tripwire' sensor, not unlike MAD used for initial detection and
tracking rather than prosecution of an attack]{.underline}. Ultimately,
[[once SAR wake]{.mark} detection [tech matures]{.mark}]{.underline}, it
will provide a potent capability to detect submarines from orbital and
high flying airborne platforms. This will drive [[submarines]{.mark} to
greater depths and lower transit speeds, and result in further [design

[[Aircraft use]{.underline}]{.mark} one type of [sensor to search for
submarines]{.underline} that has been proposed for UAVs --
[[magnetic]{.mark} anomaly [detectors]{.mark}]{.underline}. These sense
the disturbance of the Earth's magnetic field produced by the
submarine's ferromagnetic hull and steel components. The steel hull of a
submarine (and of most surface ships) not only acts as a large magnet,
but its movement through the water generates additional magnetic
effects. [These effects can be mitigated if a submarine uses a
degaussing system]{.underline} -- coils of wire within the vessel that
carry an electrical current to generate an equal and opposite magnetic
field to that of the hull. [This 'magnetic cloaking device' cancels out
the magnetic disturbance**. The latest '[closed-loop degaussing system'
is very effective at reducing]{.mark} a submarine's [magnetic
signature]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Nevertheless, close to the vessel the
magnetic field of the submarine is irregular and difficult to cancel out
completely. This gives some opportunity for the small residual magnetic
disturbance to be detected within about 1 km, meaning that

ScanEagle autonomous UAVs.11 These UAVs would be useful for
anti-submarine warfare forces to confirm the exact position of a
submarine that has already been detected. However, **[their detection

### 2AC \-\-- AUKUS CP

#### AUKUS causes escalation, prolif, and miscalc

Institute of Strategic and International Studies (ISIS) Malaysia, an
Asean research fellow at ISEAS Singapore, and a research fellow at JIIA
Tokyo. (Bunn Nagara, \"Aukus' failure to consult Asia dooms it to
disappointment,\" South China Morning Post, 11-22-2021,
https://www.scmp.com/comment/opinion/article/3156658/how-aukus-failure-consult-asia-dooms-it-disappointment,
Accessed 7-2-2022, LASA-SC

The **[case fo]{.underline}**r the **[Aukus]{.underline}** alliance
**[is]{.underline}** **[self-explanatory]{.underline}** **[to those who
are part of the pact]{.underline}**, particularly if countries in
Southeast Asia do not matter to them.

Advocates see **[the grouping of Australia, the UK and the
US]{.underline}** -- with New Zealand also considering cooperating in
areas other than nuclear submarine development -- as
**[an]{.underline}** **[overdue deterrent]{.underline}** **[against
China's maritime assertiveness.]{.underline}** It extends other
anglophone alliances that have US primacy as a common priority.

US exceptionalism desensitises Aukus to regional reservations and places
it above multilateral restraint and external oversight. As a dedicated
military alliance, **[it has focus and clarity of purpose while avoiding
ambiguity for a stronger deterrence capacity.]{.underline}**

With all members from outside Asia, **[Aukus also operates free from
regional inhibitions]{.underline}** **[and any obligation to seek
regional approval]{.underline}**. But to see these as net gains with no
downsides would be a mistake. What gives Aukus its freedom also spells
its limits and liabilities.

US militarist postures in contested spaces are not new. Freedom of
navigation operations since 2015 to curtail Chinese adventurism have
resulted only in its escalation. The Southeast Asia Treaty Organisation
withered away because of a lack of regional interest, indicating that
even co-opting US allies in Southeast Asia won't work without
region-wide endorsement.

**[Aukus and its submarines are]{.underline}** **[unlikely to dent
China's posture]{.underline}**. For the region, it could escalate
US-China tensions and provoke a tougher Chinese response.

**[The game-changer is an unprecedented nuclear-powered navy for
non-nuclear-armed Australia]{.underline}**. Some in Southeast Asia see
this as risking nuclear proliferation and nudging China into a deepening
arms race.

**[This region can wear down alliances it is unimpressed with through
sustained indifference]{.underline}**. Early euphoria over endorsement
from the Philippines and Singapore soon faded.

By late September, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte shared
Indonesian and Malaysian concerns that Aukus would spur a regional arms
race. Weeks later, Singapore Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen advised the US
to "stay very far away" from physically confronting China.

**[Aukus has clear deterrence]{.underline}** "**[sticks]{.underline}**"
**[but no diplomatic]{.underline}** "**[carrots]{.underline}**". Its
**[provocative nature could diminish diplomatic efforts
elsewhere.]{.underline}**

**[Simply]{.underline}** **[adding alliances]{.underline}** **[might not
produce a stronger coalition if partner concerns are not
addressed]{.underline}**. For example, inviting France into Aukus now
would not heal the rifts already created.

Aukus has stumbled into controversy in a region bristling with
sensitivities. **[Its US]{.underline}** imprimatur **[does not encourage
Europe or Asia]{.underline}**, whether with Trump-like unpredictability
or Biden-esque chaos.

**[Following the messy withdrawal of Western forces from
Afghanistan]{.underline}**, **[Aukus arrives in a region where people
still remember a shambolic US departure]{.underline}** from Saigon.
**[Even as Australian diplomats try selling Aukus abroad]{.underline}**,
former prime **[ministers have criticised it for]{.underline}**
**[undermining vital interests.]{.underline}**

Washington might not care to recall its own nightmares in Vietnam or
elsewhere. But **[Europeans and Asians who are more mindful of history
might be wary of how US forces tend to treat local allies when quitting
a conflict zone.]{.underline}**

Under the Aukus agreement, only nuclear-powered, not nuclear-armed,
submarines will be provided. While that will reassure China, it could
also cause more controversy and rejection.

That all Aukus countries are from outside the region may be more
troubling. **[Without belonging to the region, they have no permanent
stake or concern for its future]{.underline}**. **[If the Aukus alliance
damages relations with China, distance will help cushion the
impact.]{.underline}**

One concern is that **[Aukus nations are not]{.underline}** **[subject
to regional influence, conventions or mechanisms. They can commit or
withdraw as they alone see fit, answerable to no
authority]{.underline}**. The alliance's job description is unilaterally
defined, with little regard for regional interests or norms.

Aukus doesn't have to crimp non-military options to cause anxiety.
**[Raising militarist prospects strains the interests of the smaller,
less-developed nations that typify the region, where the status quo is
founded on settling disputes amicably and rejecting the use or threat of
force.]{.underline}**

US-China competition has spanned hypersonic missiles, carrier-based
strike aircraft and aircraft carrier design. Aukus now adds submarine
assets to the rival inventories.

**[New Zealand's potential entry implies more tension]{.underline}**.
Other anti-China measures can be expected, posing greater challenges to
security protocols.

Aukus requires far more political endorsement in a region where no
member has a military base. Deals like nuclear propulsion for some
submarines cannot compensate for the lack of assured logistical support
sourced locally. **[But the region rejects great power conflict where it
has to pick up the pieces, including its own.]{.underline}**

**[No military pact]{.underline}** **[can address the comprehensive
challenges in US-China competition]{.underline}**. Economic,
technological and other rivalries will not be resolved by raising the
military stakes. Aukus' advertised prospects have placed it beyond its
realisable potential.

Advocates and detractors could find that it delivers less than promised
because it was never fit for purpose. That members of the alliance
failed to consult countries in the region was an early liability.

**[Refusing to consider their concerns after the alliance has been
agreed only confirms its fallibility]{.underline}**. What Aukus can do
that other alliances cannot is another subject for debate, insofar as it
is worth debating.

With the popularization of information and the establishment of the
databases in great number, and how to extract data from the useful
information is the urgent problem to be solved. **[Machine learning is
the core issue of artificial intelligence]{.underline}** research, this
paper introduces the definition of machine learning and its basic
structure, and describes a variety of machine learning methods,
including rote learning, inductive learning, analogy learning ,
explained learning, **[learning based on neural network]{.underline}**
and knowledge discovery and so on. This paper also brings foreword the
objectives of machine learning, and points out the development trend of
machine learning. Learning is the main hallmark of human intelligence
and the basic means to obtain knowledge. Machine learning is the
fundamental way to make the computer intelligent. R.Shank has said:
\"**[If a computer can not learn, it will not be called
intelligent.\"]{.underline}** Since learning is an integrative mental
activity with memory, thinking, perception, feeling, and other mental
activities closely related. So, researchers from different fields give a
different interpretation with different disciplines respectively, and
give some different points of view. II. MACHINE LEARNING Machine
learning is a subject that studies how to use computers to simulate
human learning activities, and to study self-improvement methods of
computers that to obtain new knowledge and new skills, identify existing
knowledge, and continuously improve the performance and achievement.
Compared with human learning, machine learning learns faster, the
accumulation of knowledge is more facilitate the results of learning
spread easier. So, any progress of human in the field of machine
learning, will enhance the capability of computers, thus have an impact
on human society

**[Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence, which is
broadly defined as the capability of a machine to imitate intelligent
human behavior]{.underline}**. Artificial intelligence systems are used
to perform complex tasks in a way that is similar to how humans solve
problems. The goal of AI is to create computer models that exhibit
"intelligent behaviors" like humans, according to Boris Katz, a
principal research scientist and head of the InfoLab Group at CSAIL.
This means machines that can recognize a visual scene, understand a text
written in natural language, or perform an action in the physical world.
Machine learning is one way to use AI. It was defined in the 1950s by AI
pioneer Arthur Samuel as "**[the field of study that gives computers the
ability to learn without explicitly being programmed."]{.underline}**
