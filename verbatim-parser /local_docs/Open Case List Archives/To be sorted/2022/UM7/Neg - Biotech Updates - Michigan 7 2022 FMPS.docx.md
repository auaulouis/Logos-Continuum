Battlefield How to Contend With China's Risky R&D,\"

PLAYING WITH FIRE

Morally fraught experiments have flourished in China in recent years. In
2017, surgeons at Harbin Medical University defied international
condemnation to attempt the first human head transplant. In 2018, a
Shenzhen biophysicist implanted embryos edited through experiments that
risked introducing destructive mutations into the human gene pool. And
in 2019, China's Institute of Zoology invited a Spanish biochemist to
create human-monkey chimeras as organ transplant sources.

These boundary-pushing developments aren't just the work of a few bad
apples. [Rogue scientists are the predictable product of a national
system that reduces research oversight in Beijing to a "rubber
stamp,"]{.underline} according to recent testimony before the World
Health Organization by the Chinese medical ethicist Hu Qingli.
Indifference is part of the problem. The Chinese Ministry of Health, for
instance, ostensibly banned unauthorized stem cell therapies in 2012.
But a decade later, pop-up stem cell clinics still hawk untested
interventions to repair spinal cords and augment breasts. [Corruption is
another factor. Incidents of bribery at the China Food and Drug
Administration]{.underline}, now known as the National Medical Products
Administration, [led to mass casualties from at least six tainted drugs
meant to treat]{.underline} autoimmune disorders, erectile dysfunction,
and other [ailments.]{.underline}

[Then there is China's heavy-handed program of biometric surveillance
and population control]{.underline}. In 2018, Beijing used Islamic
terrorism as a pretext to launch the most technologically sophisticated
regime of data mining and collection that the world has ever seen[.
Drones with facial recognition cameras hover over regions such as
Xinjiang while police at checkpoints take mandatory iris scans, blood
samples, and genetic tests from Uyghur Muslims. Beijing exports this
digital security and mass surveillance architecture to dozens of other
countries]{.underline}, including Egypt and Uganda, where they have been
used to persecute sexual minorities and religious dissidents.

Even countries that use these tools to promote public health and safety
unwittingly supply China with their citizens' biometric information.
According to a Reuters investigation, Shenzhen-based BGI Genomics is
amassing and analyzing genetic data on women and fetuses from a
noninvasive prenatal test that the firm developed in conjunction with
the Chinese military. The kit is marketed in more than 50 countries,
including Australia, Canada, Denmark, Germany, India, Pakistan, Spain,
Thailand, and the United Kingdom. Roughly 8.4 million women have used
it. One BGI study allegedly used a military supercomputer to "map the
prevalence of viruses in Chinese women, look for indicators of mental
illness in them, and single out Tibetan and Uyghur minorities to find
links between their genes and their characteristics."

China's top-down approach to biotechnology also has serious implications
for family planning. The country's now lapsed one-child policy was
supposed to bring economic prosperity. Instead, it yielded an epidemic
of forced sterilizations, abortions, and female infanticide that
produced the country's current lopsided sex ratio and aging workforce.
But that experience hasn't stopped Beijing from experimenting with new
forms of genetic control. A 1995 law aimed at "avoid\[ing\] new births
of inferior quality and heighten\[ing\] the standards of the whole
population" requires couples at risk of passing along infectious or
hereditary diseases to use long-term contraceptives or postpone marriage
until after child-bearing age.

In 2022, moreover, millions of Chinese parents will use state-subsidized
"talent tests" to screen offspring for traits such as height,
intelligence, memory, extroversion, musical ability, and athletic
prowess. These policies of biological selection and enhancement extend
beyond family planning. A 2016 Chinese government report, for instance,
underscored the potential value of gene editing to boost troops' combat
effectiveness. Former U.S. Director of National Intelligence John
Ratcliffe warned in a recent Wall Street Journal op-ed that the Chinese
military is working to engineer "soldiers with biologically enhanced
capabilities"---from superstrength to altitude sickness resistance.

INNOVATE OR PERISH

[Chinese developments in biotechnology demand a U.S.
response]{.underline}[.]{.mark}the last national bioethics commission
lapsed in 2017, and Washington has yet to authorize a replacement. [A
new]{.mark}ly established [commission should engage with universities
and industries to set norms and expectations around bioethics.]{.mark}
[Good [models for]{.mark} this kind of [public-private
collaboration]{.mark} already [exist.]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}Organizations such as [the Secure DNA Project and the
Morningside Group---]{.mark}independent coalitions dedicated to safely
and fairly governing genetic synthesis and brain-computer interfaces,
respectively[---are examples of what scientists, ethicists, and others
can accomplish together. [Future interdisciplinary teams
can]{.underline} ]{.mark}[act as gatekeepers to [affirm moral
standards]{.mark} and condemn transgressions]{.underline}---for
instance, by [determining who gets published in high-impact
journals]{.mark} and invited to prestigious conferences.

[These partnerships can also [help bridge ideological differences on
issues]{.mark} such as [vaccine passports, gene-edited immunity,
and]{.mark} challenge [trials that pay people]{.mark} to test new
therapies for COVID-19.]{.underline} These are debates that democratic
societies are well equipped to handle. Four of the world's biggest
democracies---Australia, India, Japan, and the United States---have
recognized the existential stakes of life sciences research and recently
pledged to collectively tackle "the critical and emerging technologies
of the future, beginning with biotechnology." [That work should include
establishing a global medical ethics consortium built on international
agreements such as the Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human
Rights]{.mark}, treaties such as the Biological Weapons Convention, and
multilateral arrangements such as the T-12---a group of technologically
advanced democracies.

Still, democratic societies can't maintain bioethical standards alone.
Going forward, [[the United States and other democracies must engage
with authoritarian states,]{.mark} especially on areas of shared
interest, including biodiversity, climate change, and highly infectious
diseases.]{.underline} A natural starting point is oversight to ensure
that Beijing actually implements its Biosecurity Law of
2021---legislation designed to guide Beijing's policies on everything
from bioterrorism to biotechnology. Washington should also focus on
developing new treaty guidelines for human experimentation and
genetic-information sharing.

THE OLYMPIC SPIRIT

[China's DNA-based approach to picking its 2022 Olympic
competitors]{.underline} may look like a harbinger of a grim future. But
the country's athletic history also suggests a path for managing this
new form of geopolitical competition.

Between 1988 and 1998, [52 Chinese Olympic athletes tested positive for
banned performance-enhancing drugs]{.underline}, including a half dozen
gold medal winners. In response to the resulting international outcry,
the International Olympic Committee created the World Anti-Doping
Agency. Chastened, China developed the world's most rigorous anti-doping
measures---mandating education, exams, and pledges among athletes and
coaches. Violators got lifetime bans. The Chinese state also sought to
repair its reputation, funding new research and pledging long-term
commitments to international anti-doping efforts.

At the time, [[verification and transparency made it possible to hold
China accountable for its ethics violations, and international pressure
and the threat of meaningful sanctions drove Beijing to act more
responsibl]{.underline}y---]{.mark}in sports, anyway. [Similar policies
could work today in the field of bioethics, helping rein in China's
reckless behavior.]{.underline} In this way, Beijing's revolutionary
Olympic selection process could be the opening the world needs to thrash
out the moral status of scientific advances just over the horizon.

#### A commission on bioethics solves dual use -- guidelines, research, and framework for development

**Childress 17** -- professor of ethics at the University of Virginia,
founder of the Insitute for Practical Ethics and Public life, author of
books and articles in bioethics, served on the National Bioethics
Advisory Commission until 2001 \[James F. "The Bioethical Approach: The
President should establish a commission on bioethics." UVA Miller Center
for Public Policy. May 9, 2017\]

In his first year, [President Donald Trump should develop a charter for,
assign priorities to, and establish by executive order a new
presidential commission on bioethic]{.underline}s. Even though **[its
membership should be diverse in background, experience, and
expertise,]{.underline}** it is reasonable for the president to set up a
commission that is generally congenial to his administration's values.
[The commission's main function will be to provide advice and counsel to
the president. It can also report directly to federal departments and
agencies and to congressional committees. Further, its meetings and
reports can contribute to public discourse and education about
bioethics.]{.underline}

[Doing so will build on the best practices of previous presidents, who
have used such outside guidance to address complex ethical challenges in
the biological sciences, medicine, and health care.]{.underline} The new
president can choose from several options in how to design such a
commission, and which topics to address. **[But having such a commission
will ensure that thoughtful examination will guide emerging
technologies.]{.underline}**

**[Public bioethics is . . . vitally important.]{.underline}**

While bioethics, a term coined in 1970, has various meanings, a primary
definition features ethical reflection and judgment regarding the
biological sciences, medicine, and health care. Bioethical reflection
and judgment often focus directly on such activities as clinical care,
but public bioethics is also vitally important. [It focuses on public
policies, many of which fall under the auspices of the executive branch,
particularly the office of the president of the United States, who may
direct departments and agencies to consider and develop policies on
bioethical topics. Many of these initiatives will also involve
interactions with Congress and the courts. In addition to public
policies, the president may also have a significant impact on public
discourse and education in bioethics, which may in turn shape public
policies.]{.underline}

Sign warning of ebola virus

In the event of a public health crisis such as a Ebola pandemic, the
president should develop ethically acceptable public health policies and
practices.

[The president's priorities should include **ensuring the retention and
implementation of recently updated rules and guidelines** for protecting
human research participants and, at the same time, **facilitating
important research**; **developing a framework for** ethically
acceptable **public health policies** and practices in the event of
public health crises such as pandemics of Ebola and the Zika virus; and
moving forward the still evolving societal and public policy
**discussion about human gene editing**.]{.underline} Each of these
subjects involves questions about how best to protect individual
liberties while promoting the common good. [In addition, **other
emergent ethical problems, occasioned by scientific and technological
breakthroughs, can be helpfully addressed by a presidential bioethics
commission** just as the advent of human cloning, human embryonic stem
cell research, and synthetic biology required the attention of one or
more of the last three commissions.]{.underline}

#### Commission solves public bioethics -- interdisciplinary review, targeted expertise, and recommendations

**Childress 17** -- professor of ethics at the University of Virginia,
founder of the Institute for Practical Ethics and Public life, author of
books and articles in bioethics, served on the National Bioethics
Advisory Commission until 2001 \[James F. "The Bioethical Approach: The
President should establish a commission on bioethics." UVA Miller Center
for Public Policy. May 9, 2017\]

Presidential commission on bioethics

Many **[presidential actions have implications for bioethical
controversies.]{.underline}** For instance, Trump's nomination of
federal appellate judge Neil Gorsuch for appointment to the U.S. Supreme
Court has implications for such "hot button" bioethical issues as
abortion and religious liberties not to provide contraception. Several
presidential [actions in public bioethics, particularly under the
circumstances previously noted, can benefit from a systematic and
sustained examination by an interdisciplinary body.]{.underline} For
most of the last 40 or so years presidential (or congressional)
commissions have shouldered much of this task.

Commission meeting

There are **[three main types of institutional structures for public
bioethics: a standing national commission, a series of commissions, or
funding nongovernmental committees]{.underline}**.

There are three main types of institutional structures for public
bioethics, each with distinct advantages and disadvantages[. The first
is a standing national commission, with a broad mandate and the
opportunity to identify specific areas for attention as well as to
respond to presidential requests. A second is a series of commissions
with mandates that are more focused, targeted, and limited, having to do
with particular subjects, such as organ transplantation, human fetal
tissue transplantation research, or human embryo research]{.underline}.
A major advantage of [a standing commission]{.underline} over a series
of subject-limited commissions is that it [has time to mature as a
deliberative body, to develop practices of collective analysis and
reasoning, to be prepared for new challenges]{.underline}, and so forth.
A major advantage of a [targeted, focused commission is that its members
can be selected on the basis of their potential contributions to the
specific task at hand]{.underline}, which the committee can pursue with
concentrated attention and effort. However, it will still take some time
to get each ad hoc committee up and running.

A [third possibility is to fund nongovernmental committees to produce
reports and make recommendations for the president and other
governmental bodies]{.underline}. The specific [studies undertaken by
committees established by the National Academies of Science,
Engineering, and Medicine provide one such model]{.underline}. Often
established in response to requests and with support from federal
departments or agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
or the National Institutes of Health (NIH), these [independent
committees prepare consensus reports, often on single issues such as,
recently, novel techniques for prevention of maternal transmission of
mitochondrial DNA diseases.]{.underline} **[Such committees may appear
to be less "political" than a presidential or a congressional
commission.]{.underline}** However, they have a distinct disadvantage:
even though they may include public members as well as experts, their
process of developing findings, conclusions, and recommendations is not
as open as that of governmental bioethics commissions. They may appear
more objective and impartial, but they are less publically transparent.

#### A bioethics commission shapes governmental policy on biotech -- solves a laundry list ethical problems -- human testing, gene editing, public health

**Childress 17** -- professor of ethics at the University of Virginia,
founder of the Institute for Practical Ethics and Public life, author of
books and articles in bioethics, served on the National Bioethics
Advisory Commission until 2001 \[James F. "The Bioethical Approach: The
President should establish a commission on bioethics." UVA Miller Center
for Public Policy. May 9, 2017\]

[After Dolly the cloned sheep was born, President Bill Clinton asked the
National Bioethics Advisory Commission to prepare a report recommending
federal policies on human reproductive cloning.]{.underline}

Each of these **[three institutional mechanisms can contribute
significantly to presidential and other governmental bioethical policy
making.]{.underline}** Which one is best for a particular topic depends
in part on process values such as transparency and efficiency. While not
every bioethical topic needs to be addressed by [a standing presidential
bioethics commission]{.underline}, such a commission [has the
substantial advantage of being able to address a range of bioethical
topics]{.underline}, sometimes interrelated, in public over time and the
advantage also of being ready to address fairly quickly new issues when
they emerge. For instance, following the announcement of the cloned
sheep Dolly's birth, President Bill Clinton gave his relatively young
National Bioethics Advisory Commission 90 days to prepare a report
recommending possible federal policies toward human reproductive
cloning.

[Setting priorities for public bioethics]{.underline}

[At this point there are several bioethical topics that the]{.underline}
new president---and in some cases a new presidential [bioethics
commission---should take under advisement]{.underline}. Of the three
noted below, one (human gene editing) will require special attention
because it unsettles long-dominant bioethical and public policy
paradigms.

**[Research involving human subjects or participants]{.underline}**

One of the central areas of public bioethics is research involving human
"subjects," now increasingly called "participants" to emphasize that
these individuals collaborate with researchers on behalf of the society
and that their (or their surrogate's) [voluntary, informed consent is
indispensable]{.underline}. [Research involving human participants was
the focus of the very first commission, the National Commission for the
Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral
Research]{.underline} (1974--78), which was established in response to
several scandals in biomedical research. The most notorious scandal was
the U.S. Public Health Service's research for over 40 years on the
effects of untreated syphilis on close to 400 African American males in
and around Tuskegee, Alabama. **[The commission's work led to new
regulations to govern federally funded research (and much other
research).]{.underline}** Other subsequent commissions have reexamined
these rules, in part because research involving human participants has
changed so much in volume, the number of institutions and researchers
involved, international scope, the nature of the research (e.g.,
involving genetic information), complexity, etc. Now, after several
decades, some of the extant rules may underprotect while others
overprotect human participants and some make it difficult or burdensome
to conduct needed research.

On January 19, 2017, the newly revised Common Rule---the set of federal
regulations for ethically conducting research involving human
subjects---was published in the Federal Register, following discussions
that had germinated since its original enactment in 1991, deliberations
that started in earnest in 2011, and broad input throughout the extended
process of rulemaking. The new rule, which is scheduled to take effect
in 2018, might appear, at first glance, to be a good target for
revocation given the new administration's commitment to extensive
deregulation. However, this revision of a long-established rule is
designed to facilitate valuable research, in part by reducing
unnecessary regulatory burdens, for instance, by generally requiring a
single Institutional Review Board review in multi-institutional studies
and by standing against the needlessly long and complex consent forms.
At the same time, it is designed to better protect the rights and
welfare of research participants. It would be a mistake to rescind this
revised Common Rule without a thorough review through one of the three
mechanisms of public bioethics described above.

**[An ethical framework for public health]{.underline}**

[In an era of globalization, marked by fast and easy travel, serious
threats from infectious diseases confront the world]{.underline}. Ebola
and the Zika virus are just two recent examples, and the World Health
Organization has identified a number of other potentially serious
threats. [The new presidential commission should build on the work on
public health ethics]{.underline} (developed in the context of Ebola) by
the (current) Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical
Issues, and on earlier work by the Ethics Subcommittee of the Advisory
Committee to the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC). This is particularly important not only because of the
recurrent threat of epidemics and pandemics but also because in 2013 the
Advisory Committee voted to terminate its Ethics Subcommittee and to set
up ethics workgroups on an ad hoc basis. **[In view of society's
tendency to lurch from one crisis to another, the new presidential
commission could and should attend more systematically to several
critical issues in public health to create a clear and practical
framework to guide policy.]{.underline}** These issues include reduction
of disparities in population health in outbreaks of infectious diseases;
the fair and equitable distribution of scarce goods, such as vaccines,
in a crisis; and the conditions for justifiable restrictions of
liberties, for instance, through quarantine and isolation. This could
enable the president to take the lead in developing a policy framework
to address public health crises, which require federal and state action.

DNA double helix

CRISPR is a kind of molecular scissors or nanoscissors that is more
precise than its predecessors for gene editing.

**[Human gene editing]{.underline}**

Long the subject of science fiction, human genetic engineering in the
form of gene editing is now emerging as a realistic possibility thanks
to major scientific and technological breakthroughs. One such
technology, CRISPR/Cas9, is a kind of molecular scissors or nanoscissors
that is both easier to use and more precise than its predecessors. It is
being readied for phase I cancer trials involving human participants in
the U.S. and in China. Other new gene editing technologies are already
in early clinical trials.

For several decades, two supposedly bright lines have delimited policies
and practices of human genetic modification. The first line divides
somatic gene modification, which involves cells that do not pass on
genetic modifications to offspring, from germ-line modification, which
involves cells that pass on genetic modifications to offspring and
future generations. The second line divides gene therapy (i.e.,
treatment or prevention of a disease, such as cancer) from genetic
enhancement (i.e., improving nondiseased capabilities, such as
intelligence or height). While these lines are not as bright as commonly
supposed, they remain important.

Versions of the following figure been widely used in efforts to depict
these lines:

These distinctions became embedded in public policy, for example, in the
guidelines of the NIH's Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee (RAC),
especially to assure the public that it would be possible to move
forward with "human gene therapy" trials without legitimating either
germ-line interventions or genetic enhancements that are considered
ethically problematic. An intervention in Category I (above) has
generally been deemed acceptable, if it is determined to be safe for the
recipient, because it is similar to other medical treatments intended to
provide a medical benefit to the individual patient (such as a bone
marrow transplant for leukemia).

Future generations cannot consent to these risks, which are imposed on
them and which may be irreversible.

Interventions in Category II cross the line into germ-line
modification---for instance, genetic modifications of embryos are
heritable and can thus be passed on to future generations. Pressure will
almost certainly emerge in the near future to move to germ-line
interventions because, in some cases, this may be the most effective and
efficient way to treat/prevent some diseases and because those same
treatment/prevention benefits will be passed on to future offspring.
However, major concerns immediately arise. One has to do with the
experimental genetic modification of embryos. Another concern focuses on
the unquantifiable risk to future generations. Still another concern is
that future generations cannot consent to these risks, which are imposed
on them and which may be irreversible. This can even be considered
interference with evolution. Whereas proponents of interventions in
Category II sometimes insist we should seize this power and speed up the
process of evolution, critics respond that we lack the capacity to
reliably predict and control these changes and their effects as well as
the ethical wisdom to assess them. Finally, concerns arise about the
possible negative impact of these genetic modifications on attitudes and
practices toward persons with disabilities. And simmering eugenic forces
should not be neglected.

[Even though we can clearly locate some interventions on the side of
treatment/prevention and others on the side of enhancement, the line is
not always easy to draw]{.underline}. And, while there is substantial
opposition to enhancement in either somatic or germ-line interventions,
it is much greater in the latter, as expressed in worries about
"designer babies." [Social justice concerns arise for both somatic and
germ-line enhancement:]{.underline} the "haves" would benefit more than
the "have nots," further deepening social inequalities. Such concerns
figure in public opinion surveys. For instance, a Pew Research Center
report in 2016 found that the U.S. public is wary of biomedical
technologies to enhance human abilities and that their fears and
concerns outweigh their hopes.

**[The U.S. government needs to continue to play a pivotal, though
nonexclusive, role in the still nascent complex global governance of
gene editing.]{.underline}**

#### **Bioethics commissions solves global governance -- influences social norms and professional standards**

**Childress 17** -- professor of ethics at the University of Virginia,
founder of the Institute for Practical Ethics and Public life, author of
books and articles in bioethics, served on the National Bioethics
Advisory Commission until 2001 \[James F. "The Bioethical Approach: The
President should establish a commission on bioethics." UVA Miller Center
for Public Policy. May 9, 2017\]

Finally, the [new president and his administration will have to consider
the governance of gene editing, both domestically and
globally]{.underline}. Of course[, governance]{.underline} is not
limited to governments and their policies. It [encompasses various other
social institutions as well, and its exercise is not limited to laws and
regulations but involves professional standards and the
like]{.underline}. Nevertheless, **[there is a central role for
government, and the U.S. government needs to continue to play a pivotal,
though nonexclusive, role in the still nascent complex global
governance]{.underline}** of gene editing, as discussed, for instance,
in the 2015 International Summit on Human Gene Editing. The U.S.
government's laws and regulations, as well as its investment decisions,
will be crucial both tangibly and symbolically.

Given the perennial problems in health care and in research involving
human participants, the outbreaks of serious and even deadly infectious
diseases, and the rapid pace of global scientific and technological
change, the new president will surely confront and need to address
several bioethical problems. How the president meets these challenges
and helps our government, the scientific and biomedical communities, and
the public deliberate about appropriate policies and practices in
response will be one of the tests---and measures---of our nation's new
chief executive.

#### Bioethics advisory commission solves dual use regulations -- guides policy in emerging tech and public sector

**Gavin 2/3** -- director of executive communications at National
Academies \[Molly. "NAS and NAM Presidents, Other Experts Urge Biden
Administration to Reinstate Presidential Bioethics Commission" News
Release, National Academies. March 2, 2022\]

News Release \| March 2, 2022

WASHINGTON --- **[The Biden administration should reinstate a
presidential bioethics advisory commission to help inform and guide
policy decisions that have bioethical implications]{.underline}**, said
National Academy of Sciences President Marcia McNutt and National
Academy of Medicine President Victor J. Dzau in a recent letter to
Alondra Nelson, interim director of the White House Office of Science
and Technology Policy. The letter was delivered with an independent
white paper underscoring the need for such a commission, [authored by an
ad hoc working group of experts in medicine, bioethics, and law that
includes members of the past three presidential commissions for the
study of bioethical issues.]{.underline}

"Over the past five decades, [U.S. bioethics commissions under both
Democratic and Republican administrations have helped guide the
development of government policy affecting millions of U.S. citizens in
important ways,]{.underline}" says the letter from McNutt and Dzau.
"However, **[a presidential commission on bioethics has not been
appointed since 2017]{.underline}**. As a result, despite many current
events and developments with critical bioethics implications, important
government decisions are being made without such a commission to
examine, review, and help inform U.S. policymaking."

The accompanying white paper --- written by a working group led by
co-chairs Susan Wolf, Regents Professor, University of Minnesota, and
Alta Charo, Warren P. Knowles Professor Emerita of Law and Bioethics,
University of Wisconsin-Madison --- identifies [existing and emerging
topics for which a presidential bioethics commission could provide
analysis, advice, and public consensus building, such as
pandemic-related public health decisions, the use of potentially biased
**artificial intelligenc**e and **adaptive algorithms** in health care
research and clinical care, or bioethical issues raised by **climate
change.**]{.underline}

For instance, "No prior bioethics commission has canvassed the ethical
issues raised by research and interventions that can alter ecology ....
Nor has any commission addressed the health and equity implications of
heat waves and heat stress, changes in the distribution of vector-borne
diseases, flooding and displacement, and increased ozone pollution, to
mention just a few effects of climate change," the white paper says.

"**[Such a commission can address the values conflicts underlying policy
debates, promote public consensus, and inform decisions by regulatory
and policymaking bodies that may not be authorized to consider broad
ethical issues."]{.underline}**

The full text of the letter and the white paper are also available here.

The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine are
private, nonprofit institutions that provide independent, objective
analysis and advice to the nation to solve complex problems and inform
public policy decisions related to science, technology, and medicine.
They operate under an 1863 congressional charter to the National Academy
of Sciences, signed by President Lincoln.

Need for a New Commission The United States has not had a federal
bioethics commission since 2017. In the interceding five years, [a
global pandemic has raised profound ethical issues in public health
research, clinical practice, and public policy--issues that require
attention to the public good as well as individual
autonomy.]{.underline} [Those include how to formulate public policy in
the face of uncertainty, how best to conduct rapid research on vaccines
and treatments, how to reconcile population research with individual
patient needs, how to allocate access to therapeutic interventions in
times of scarcity, and how to address the devastating health disparities
the pandemic has revealed]{.underline}. 3 As noted in Appendix A, the
President's Commission was followed by a failed effort to create a
Biomedical Ethics Board in the legislative branch with six Senators and
six Representatives equally divided between the two major parties. More
specialized executive branch panels have included the Advisory Committee
on Human Radiation Experiments (1994-95) established to investigate
human radiation experiments and the intentional release of radiation
between 1944 and 1974 and to recommend appropriate standards for
evaluating the responsibility of individuals and institutions for those
past acts. 4 The Brain Research Through Advancing Innovative
Neurotechnologies® (BRAIN) Initiative. https://braininitiative.nih.gov/.
3 [At the same time, our world faces a climate crisis that imperils the
natural environment and human health. No prior bioethics commission has
canvassed the ethical issues raised by research and interventions that
can alter ecology, **including genetic modification** of insect
populations to control transmission of certain deadly diseases, or using
genome editing to rescue endangered species and perhaps even to revive
some that are extinct.]{.underline} Nor has any commission addressed the
health and equity implications of heat waves and heat stress, changes in
the distribution of vector-borne diseases, flooding and displacement,
and increased ozone pollution, to mention just a few effects of climate
change. Yet ethical concerns---including our obligations to future
generations---are central to understanding and solving these
environmental problems. [Another domain not previously addressed by a
bioethics commission is the growing integration of artificial
intelligence (AI), machine learning, and software algorithms into
medical and public health practice.]{.underline} The ethical challenges
are profound. If complex algorithms are based on inadequate or
unrepresentative data, their use risks magnifying and cementing racial
and other bias into research and clinical care, while undermining
professional expertise and shared decision-making with patients[.
Regulators face daunting challenges, such as ensuring the quality of
adaptive algorithms that evolve as they are used. Ethical issues raised
by AI in health care and public health call for exactly the kind of
path-breaking analysis and consensus building that a bioethics
commission can offer.]{.underline} A bioethics commission could also
advance analyses of existing technologies whose rapid development
continues to raise unresolved issues. Genetic and genomic technologies,
for example, offer an expanding range of predictive and screening tools
-- including direct-to-consumer tests \-- with continuing debate over
appropriate uses and safeguards. The growing use of such tools risks
placing undue emphasis on genetics to the exclusion of social

Mexico to the United Nations, "Keeping Pace with an Accelerated World:
Bringing Rapid Technological Change to the United Nations Agenda",

[Humanity is at a crossroads: we face both the opportunities and
challenges of a range of powerful and emerging technologies that will
drive radical shifts in the way we live. The accelerated pace at which
technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), biotechnology,
robotics, automation, advanced materials and quantum computing are
developing, is already transforming the systems that we take for granted
today]{.underline}. From how we produce and transport goods and services
to the way we communicate, collaborate or even elect our governments,
rapid technological change---which often happens at an exponential
pace---is reshaping how we experience the world around us.

[The good news is that this period of rapid technological change is in
its early stages and is still under our control.]{.underline} Standing
at this crossroads means that we bear a huge responsibility, since [new
technologies can increase inequality among and within countries, replace
obsolete labour forces, affect vulnerable groups, foster a concentration
of critical knowledge and wealth, and pose significant ethical
questions. However, such technologies can also be used positively to
accelerate achievement of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
and their 169 targets.]{.underline}

[According to the World Bank, the proportion of jobs at risk of
automation is higher in developing countries than in developed
countries]{.underline}. From a purely technological standpoint, two
thirds of jobs in developing countries are susceptible to automation in
the coming decades. However, the effects of that process could be
moderated by lower wages and slower adoption of technology1 in those
countries. Using an adjusted measure based on technological feasibility,
the share of employment that is susceptible to automation by country
ranges from 55 per cent in Uzbekistan to 85 per cent in Ethiopia,2 while
the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development average is 57
per cent.

On the other hand, using smart grids, big data and the Internet of
things can help reduce energy consumption, balance energy demand and
supply, and ensure and improve the management of energy distribution,
while increasing the role of renewable sources by allowing households to
feed surplus energy from solar panels or wind turbines into the grid.
The cost of solar cells has dropped by a factor of more than 100 in the
last 40 years, from \$76.67 per watt in 1977 to \$0.029 per
kilowatt-hour (kWh) in 2017. Solar energy is now the cheapest generation
technology in many parts of the world.3

[National and international institutions are challenged to keep pace
with the economic and social consequences of new technologies, which is
why there is a growing need for a discussion on this issue. The United
Nations, valued for its normative and impartial standard-setting role,
provides a unique platform for important orientation on this phenomenon.
To achieve the 2030 Agenda and ensure that no one is left behind, Member
States, along with the private sector, academia, civil society and other
relevant stakeholders, must develop international frameworks to promote
and ensure that the benefits of this revolution are evenly
shared.]{.underline}

#### Effective ILaw key to combatting climate change

**Hunter 21** (David Hunter, "International Environmental Law", American
Bar Association, January 5^th^ 2021,

WC-NAS)

Profound environmental changes caused by the increasing scale of human
activity have led many observers to conclude that the planet has entered
the "Anthropocene"---a geologic era signified by human impact on the
biosphere. International environmental law is the set of agreements and
principles that reflect the world\'s collective effort to manage our
transition to the Anthropocene by  resolving our most serious
environmental problems, including climate change, ozone depletion and
mass extinction of wildlife. More generally, international environmental
law aims to achieve sustainable development---i.e., development that
allows people to have a high quality of life today without sacrificing
the quality of life of future generations. International environmental
law is thus critical both for addressing specific environmental threats
and for integrating long-term environmental protection into the global
economy.

But not all environmental threats trigger international (as opposed to
solely national or local) response. For countries to sacrifice their
autonomy, some advantage must be gained in addressing the problem
collectively. Typically, countries turn to international cooperation
where (l) the environmental impacts are transboundary (such as pollution
into the Great Lakes) or global (such as climate change); (2) some
international activity contributes to environmental harm, for example,
the international trade in elephant ivory or the killing of whales; or
(3) international coordination of financial or technical support can
catalyze action (for example, for the global conservation of biological
diversity). In these circumstances, international cooperation---whether
in the form of a binding treaty or a non-binding "soft law"
agreement---is necessary for an effective response to the environmental
challenge.

Throughout most of the last century, international environmental law
primarily reflected bilateral or regional disputes over shared
resources, such as rivers or lakes that cut across national boundaries.
These disputes led to diplomatic tensions that either resulted in an
international legal case or were settled through relatively narrow
regional or bilateral treaties. The most famous and important of these
disputes was the Trail Smelter Arbitration, where Canada was held
responsible for air pollution entering the United States.\
In recent years, bilateral disputes involving for example Slovakia's
proposed construction of a dam on the Danube River near Hungary,
Uruguay's authorization of two pulp mills that threatened to pollute
Argentina, and Australia's challenge of Japanese whaling operations,
highlight the importance of international law in peacefully resolving
environmental conflicts between countries.  Such disputes are resolved
at the International Court of Justice, the UN Law of the Sea Tribunal or
other international tribunals.

In addition to the peaceful resolution of environmental conflicts,
international environmental law also is relied on to balance the
planet's ecological limits with the world's ever-growing economy
to prevent irreversible environmental harm in the first place. Today,
governments regularly meet to address the general sustainability of the
planet or to negotiate one of the literally hundreds of bilateral,
regional and global treaties aimed at managing a specific environmental
challenge before it's too late.

Sustainable Development Summits

The United Nations first convened countries to address the global
environment at the 1972 UN Conference on the Human Environment in
Stockholm.  The Stockholm conference highlighted the international
aspects of emerging environmental challenges and legitimized the
environment as an area for international cooperation.  The Stockholm
conference also created the United Nations Environment Programme
(UNEP)--- an institutional home for environmental protection in the
United Nations. Headquartered in Nairobi, Kenya, UNEP continues today to
be a leading catalyst for global environmental cooperation.

Since the 1972 Stockholm Conference, the world has met regularly in a
series of major summits aimed at shifting the world generally toward a
path of sustainability.  The most important by far has been the 1992 UN
Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), also known as the Rio
\"Earth Summit.\'  Virtually every world leader attended the Earth
Summit, where they  agreed to three major treaties (addressing climate
change, biological diversity and desertification), and a 500-page
blueprint for sustainable development (known as Agenda 21).  Most
importantly, Rio marked the formal acceptance of sustainable development
as the goal of a modern economy and of international environmental law.
Indeed, since Rio the concept of sustainable development has received
nearly universal acceptance among every sector of international society.

Sustainable development was also the organizing framework for major
environment and development summits in Johannesburg in 2002 and Rio
again in 2012 (the Rio+20 Summit).  These summits are big affairs,
attended not only by governments but also by thousands of civil society
and private sector representatives.  Reflecting this wider audience, the
recent UN-sponsored Summits have promoted public-private Partnerships
for Sustainable Development and more recently led to adoption of the
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  These non-binding goals serve as
a strategic plan for coordinating the global community toward achieving
concrete, measurable goals by  2030.

#### Effective ILaw prevents extinction-- puts a cap on conflict

**Pickering 14** (Heath Pickering, "Why Do States Mostly Obey
International Law?, " E-International Relations, February 4^th^ 2014,
<http://www.e-ir.info/2014/02/04/why-do-states-mostly-obey-international-law/>)

All states in the contemporary world, including great powers, are
compelled to justify their behaviour according to legal rules and
accepted norms. This essay will analyse the extent to which states
comply and the reasons for their compliance. Essentially, the extent to
which states follow their international obligations has developed over
the past 400 years. From a historical perspective, international
obligations and accepted norms were founded following two key
developments in European history. In 1648, the Treaty of Westphalia
ended the Thirty Years' War by acknowledging the sovereign authority of
various European princes.\[1\] This event marked the advent of
traditional international law, based on principles of territoriality and
state autonomy. Then in 1945, again following major wars initiated in
Europe, states began to integrate on a global scale.\[2\] The UN Charter
became the international framework for which norms of sovereignty and
non-intervention were enshrined. Now, as a result of modern technology,
communication, transport, and more, the evolving process of
Globalisation, "The internationalization of the world",\[3\] has
provided an opportunity for international law and accepted norms to
reach every corner of the globe. However, the development of
international law and accepted norms has not compelled states to comply
all the time. Instead, the trend over the past 400 years has shown that
states have been mostly compelled to justify their behavior according to
legal rules and accepted norms. The emphasis on mostly should be
stressed. Even though the UN Charter does not permit violating
sovereignty through the use of aggression, the extent to which states
follow their international obligations varies. Louis Henkin's book, How
Nations Behave, articulates the extent of compliance.\[4\] He said,
"Almost all nations observe almost all principles of international law
and almost all of their obligations almost all the time".\[5\] As such,
the trend in contemporary international relations is that war remains
possible, but it is much less acceptable now than it was a century or
even half a century ago.\[6\] The benefit of the trend is that almost
full compliance is said to lead states into a pattern of obedience and
predictable behaviour.\[7\] Therefore, conflict only arises when
countries fail to comply. States attempt to manage the friction with
ongoing compliance through the principle of pacta sunt servanda -- the
adherence to agreements.\[8\] Over time, such agreements to norms and
treaties have diminished sovereignty, increased international
institutions, given rise to non-state actors, and rapidly developed the
contemporary customary and treaty based rules system.\[9\] The evolution
of the dispute-settlement procedures of the World Trade Organisation
(WTO), the establishment of the International Criminal Court (ICC), and
the establishment of numerous global treaties illustrate states agreeing
voluntarily to give up a portion of their sovereignty.

#### ICs generate [reputational costs]{.underline} that solve territorial disputes

Chicago, "DECISIONS THAT BIND: THE ROLE OF REPUTATION COSTS IN
TERRITORIAL DISPUTES", Alumni Perspectives: APCSS,

Implications

This paper attempted to explain the role of international pressure and
states' perception of reputation costs in territorial disputes. States
are generally reluctant to enter binding settlement in territorial
disputes because the process ties the disputants to an outcome prior to
a decision rendered about the contested territory. However, this type of
agreed settlement procedure can be more effective in resolving disputes
because states are accountable to any decision reached. While states are
generally reluctant to enter this type of arrangement, they are
incentivized to make this decision when reputation costs have been
triggered by external pressure. This pressure is particularly effective
when salient actors are involved, such as major powers, regional forums,
or international organizations like the UN. The disputant who was once
unwilling to enter binding settlement is incentivized to change its
stance in order to stem the pressure from the international community
and avoid reputation costs.

These mechanisms are not generalizable to all disputes, but provide
important implications for other cases, like the South China Sea
disputes. The Philippines' use of an international mechanism to advance
its claims has important implications for understanding the role of
international pressure and reputation costs in conflict management. When
there is power asymmetry in a dyad, the country with no chance of
winning a military contest or wielding military leverage can turn to
courts to resolve territorial claims. This is an attractive strategy for
both Belize and the Philippines.31 By placing the contested issue in the
context of international law, the disputes come under scrutiny by the
international community. By doing so, China and Guatemala are confronted
with significant pressure to submit to binding settlement. For
Guatemala, such pressure was significant enough to make the decision to
bind itself. For China, whether it will ever decide to enter binding
settlement is unclear.

Although China has expressed immediate refusal to participate in
arbitration proposed by the Philippines, it is premature to declare
China is immune to reputation costs\*\*\*

. While China may be reluctant to give up its control over the
territories, changing policies elsewhere demonstrates China is
responsive to reputation costs in certain circumstances. For instance,
China joined the UN regime on Human Rights as it was criticized by the
US and other UN members on its domestic human rights policies. Although
China has not changed its stance on arbitration with Philippines,
China's recent North Korea policy demonstrates a significant departure
from previous partnership. China has helped sustain Kim Jong-Un regime,
by opposing harsh international sanctions in UNSC. For this reason,
China has been viewed as a crucial partner to achieve North Korea's
denuclearization if China participates in international sanctions. After
North Korea's fourth nuclear test in 2016, China for the first time has
agreed on consistent implementation of UNSC resolution to impose
sanctions against North Korea. When China is responsive to reputation
costs and when it is not depends on the salience of an issue agenda to
national objectives and regime survival. But given that China is a
reputation seeker, the range of those circumstances in which China may
be susceptible to international pressure may yet widen over time.

### 2NC - Bioethics

#### UN standards are uniquely key to international bioethics­-- creates applicable human dignity norms

**UNESCO No Date** (The United Nations Educational, Scientific, and
Cultural Organization, "Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human
Rights",
<https://en.unesco.org/themes/ethics-science-and-technology/bioethics-and-human-rights>,
WC-NAS)

The background

[A growing number of scientific practices have extended beyond national
borders and the necessity of setting universal ethical guidelines
covering all issues raised in the field of bioethics and the need to
promote the emergence of shared values have increasingly been a feature
of the international debate]{.underline}. The need for standard-setting
action in the field of bioethics is felt throughout the world, often
expressed by scientists and practitioners themselves and by lawmakers
and citizens.

[States have a special responsibility not only with respect to
bioethical reflection but also in the drafting of any legislation that
may follow. In the field of bioethics, whilst many States have framed
laws and regulations aimed at protecting human dignity and human rights
and freedoms, many other countries wish to establish benchmarks and
sometimes lack the means to do so.]{.underline}

At its 31st session in 2001, the General Conference invited the
Director-General to submit "the technical and legal studies undertaken
regarding the possibility of elaborating universal norms on bioethics".

At the request of the Director-General, the International Bioethics
Committee (IBC) therefore drafted the [Report of the IBC on the Report
of the IBC on the Possibility of Elaborating a Universal Instrument on
Bioethics](http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0013/001302/130223e.pdf) \[PDF,
82 KB\] finalized on 13 June 2003. The Report examines some issues in
bioethics that could be addressed in an international instrument and
illustrates how the elaboration of such an instrument could contribute
to and support international efforts being made to provide ethical
guidelines in matters related to recent scientific developments. The
Report explores the likely form and scope of an instrument as well as
its value in terms of education, information dissemination,
awareness-raising and public debate.

The mandate

At its 32nd session in October 2003, the General Conference considered
that it was "opportune and desirable to set universal standards in the
field of bioethics with due regard for human dignity and human rights
and freedoms, in the spirit of cultural pluralism inherent in bioethics"
(32 C/Res. 24).

The General Conference also invited "the Director-General to continue
preparatory work on a declaration on universal norms on bioethics, by
holding consultation with Member States, the other international
organizations concerned and relevant national bodies, and to submit a
draft declaration to it at its 33rd session" (32 C/Res. 24).

Which instrument?

As to the form of the instrument, IBC -- supported by Member States
during the General Conference -- came out clearly in favour of an
instrument of a declaratory nature, at least initially, which would be
best suited to a constantly changing context and would enable the
broadest possible consensus to be reached among Member States.

The form of the instrument does not prevent its content from
contributing to a code of universally recognized general principles of
bioethics (such as human dignity, solidarity, freedom of research,
respect for privacy, confidentiality, non-discrimination, informed
consent, integrity of research and intellectual honesty) insofar as
these principles pertain to bioethics. Lastly, an instrument on
bioethics must call strong attention to the importance of
awareness-raising, information, education, consultation and public
debate.

Why UNESCO?

[Over the years UNESCO has confirmed its standard-setting role in
bioethics. UNESCO has contributed to the formulation of basic principles
in bioethics through in particular the [Universal Declaration on the
Human Genome and Human
Rights](https://en.unesco.org/themes/ethics-science-and-technology/human-genome-and-human-rights),
adopted unanimously and by acclamation by the General Conference in 1997
and endorsed by the United Nations General Assembly in 1998, and
the [International Declaration on Human Genetic
Data](https://en.unesco.org/themes/ethics-science-and-technology/human-genetic-data)]{.underline},
adopted unanimously and by acclamation by the General Conference on 16
October 2003.

[Apart from the fact that ethical issues related to the advances in life
sciences and their applications were and still are highly topical, the
depth and extent of their roots in the cultural, philosophical and
religious bedrocks of various human communities were reason enough for
UNESCO, the only organization whose fields of competence include the
social and human sciences, true to its ethical vocation, to take the
lead in this initiative.]{.underline}

#### GMOs spread antibiotic resistance -- lack of treatment capability, biosolid recycling, and selection advantage magnify the environmental impact

**Hilding 19** -- Director of Communicatons at Washington State
University College of Engineering and Architecture \[Tina. "Researchers
find persistence of antibiotic-resistant GMO genes in sewage sludge."
WSU Insider. 10/18/19.\]

**[Antibiotic-resistant genes that have been inserted into genetically
modified food are able to withstand conventional wastewater
treatments.]{.underline}**

[The findings, contained in a research paper published]{.underline}
recently [in]{.underline} the journal[, Biotechnology and
Bioengineering, might **point to a previously unknown way that bacteria
may become resistant to life-saving antibiotics**.]{.underline} The work
is based on graduate work done at Duke University by Courtney Gardner,
now an assistant professor in WSU's Department of Civil and
Environmental Engineering. She, along with Professor Tim Ginn in the
Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, have recently
received a 3-year, USDA grant to continue the research.

**[Antibiotic resistance, which bacteria adopt in response to
interactions with the drugs, is increasing around the world and
threatens the ability to treat many common infections and
diseases.]{.underline}**

["We determined that extracellular DNA released from digestion appears
to be ubiquitous in wastewater treatment in the U.S.]{.underline} --
it's much more persistent in the environment than we originally
thought," said Gardner. "Historically, I think [it's likely that this
probably has contributed to the spread of antibiotic resistance in the
environment]{.underline}.

"The magnitude of that contribution is still unknown --- it is something
we are trying to determine," she added.

Unlike in Europe, which has largely banned the cultivation of
genetically-modified crops for human consumption, [GMOs are a common
part of the food supply in the United States.]{.underline} Although the
practice is becoming less common, [companies have in the past added
antibiotic resistant genes in their modifications as a helpful marker to
differentiate genetically modified plant cells.]{.underline} About 130
lines of genetically modified crops contain such genes. Researchers have
found that **[when people eat these foods, the incorporated genetic
material moves through the digestive system, and that these genes can be
released into the environment, including into wastewater treatment
plants.]{.underline}**

Meanwhile, [half of the biosolids produced in the U.S. after wastewater
treatment are used as agricultural fertilizers]{.underline} every year,
[providing a potential pathway for moving the antibiotic resistant genes
and bacteria through the environment]{.underline}.

In the new study, funded by the National Science Foundation, the
researchers added antibiotic resistant genes to reactors to mimic the
most common wastewater treatment for 30- and 60-day treatments that
generate class A biosolids. To the mix, they added common antibiotics,
such as penicillin, that are also often found in wastewater.

The researchers found that [fragments of antibiotic resistance genes,
especially longer strands, persisted through the treatment
process]{.underline}. They believe that the DNA strands latch onto
particles in soil or sediment in the digesters. There they lie protected
from the processes that generally kill microbes and, instead, become a
reservoir of genetic material.

Furthermore, the researchers found that the [genes appeared to be taken
up by bacteria in the sludge.]{.underline} The researchers theorize that
[the bacteria in sewage, such as staphylococcus, are stressed when they
encounter antibiotics. **By picking up the strands of
antibiotic-resistant DNA, they gain a selection
advantage.**]{.underline}

In their new study, Gardner and Ginn will now be tracking and modeling
the long-range transport of antibiotic resistant genes in agricultural
fields. They will also be studying silencing RNA molecules, which are
used in modern genetically modified crops to silence undesirable crop
traits. The researchers want to know whether the remnant genetic
material from silencing RNA molecules might bind with other bacteria in
the environment to unintentionally silence desirable traits.

"Our concern from a genetic and bacterial standpoint is that there are
probably some non-target matching sequences between the silencing RNA
and environmental microbes and that it could cause the loss of a gene
and possibly a functional gene," said Gardner.

#### Antibiotic resistant bacteria have the potential to destroy all life on earth

**Garrett 2016** - senior fellow for global health at the Council on
Foreign Relations\
Laurie, \"Anti-biotic resistant bacteria and the world\'s peril,\" Sep
19,
https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/antibiotic-resistant-bacteria-and-the-world-s-peril/

Welcome to the Anthropocene, the era in which one species---human
beings---so utterly dominates the planet that all of the driving forces
of climate, oceans, geology, air and every other life form on Earth are
controlled by the activities of humanity. Most of the damage is
thoughtless. Humans don't decide to pollute, they just do so. People
don't make a choice to lower the numbers of oxygen-producing trees on
the planet, they just chop them down without thinking about it. [Among
the most dangerous of these thoughtless actions executed by our species
is wild misuse of antibiotics]{.underline}. On September 21, the United
Nations General Assembly is convening a special session to look at ways
to curb use of precious medicinal drugs that are swiftly being outwitted
by drug-resistant bacteria, making everything from a scraped knee to a
bout of pneumonia far more dangerous and difficult to treat. But that
focus, important as it is, remains limited to human use of chemicals and
concern about their misuse to our species' health. Genuine governance
and stewardship in the Anthropocene requires a far broader look at what
our activities mean for the planet, writ large. [At the most basic
levels of life every single system on Earth is controlled]{.underline},
or influenced, [by microbes---]{.underline}microscopic creatures ranging
from nano-sized viruses to enormous colonies of bacteria; from
populations of microbes in the depths of the oceans to the inside of the
human gut. A human being is made up of about 30 trillion cells and 39
trillion microbes, most of which are indispensable to our mental and
physical health. If all the viruses and parasites swarming inside and on
the skin of a human being are tallied the microbe-to-cell ratio is about
ten-to-one. The microbes---collectively known as the Human
Microbiome---digest our food, help us do battle with invading pathogens,
clean our skin and provide us fuel. [Life without microbes is no life at
all. Antibiotics kill bacteria, and as anybody who has been on a long
course of the drugs to treat an ailment knows, the medicine is
indiscriminate]{.underline}, knocking off not only invaders like the
bugs that cause pneumonia and ear infections, but also those that
prevent stomach aches and constipation in response to ingestion of food.
Human overuse or misuse of antibiotics has bred the emergence of
Superbugs that are not only resistant to the drugs, but may be able to
surge in numbers within a person's gut, for example, leading to
dangerous imbalances in bacterial populations that then cause diabetes,
some types of heart disease, depression and an enormous range of common
diseases. [The Earth has its own microbiome, representing about a third
of the weight of all biological material and life forms on the
planet.]{.underline} And it is every bit as indispensable to the planet
as your microbiome is to your personal health. [Microbes living on the
surface of the oceans, for example, aerosolize and end up in the
atmosphere, where water droplets collect on their surfaces, forming
clouds . Eliminating those microbes would directly affect rainfall. More
oxygen that humans breathe is made by microbes than plants. And even the
plants rely upon the microbiome of soil to transfer nutrients into their
roots, allowing trees and forests to make more oxygen for humans to
breathe]{.underline}. So it should be with some considerable alarm that
we consider the killing potential manmade antibiotics have for Earth's
microbiome. When people, or our pets and livestock, take antibiotics,
these substances and possible resistant bacteria are passed via sewage
and septic tanks into water systems and the seas. Ton for ton, 80
percent of antibiotics are used to treat livestock, not to cure
infections, but to make them fatter. Most of those chemicals, which are
routinely loaded into animal feed and dumped into aquaculture systems,
are chemical identical or closely similar to human treatments. [As the
human population increases and wealth grows, demand for animal protein
is soaring]{.underline}. Researchers estimate that for every 2.2 pounds
of cattle weight 45 milligrams of antibiotics were used as growth
promoters; for chickens that's 148 milligrams per 2.2 pounds and for
pigs it's a whopping 172. On a global scale that translates into about
63,000 tons of antibiotics used in agriculture in 2010, which
researchers predict will soar to 106,000 tons over the next 14 years.
[Today the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, alone, [uses 25
million pounds of antibiotic products on livestock every
year]{.underline}. [Animal poop has always been a part of the
environment, and played a big positive role in supplying bacteria,
viruses and parasites for the Earth Microbiome.]{.underline} But [the
once-diverse range of large animals that roamed the planet has shrunk,
with 92 percent of the poopers lost and the entire Earth Microbiome
fertilized by just eight percent of the species that existed after the
Ice Age]{.underline}, most of them used as livestock or pets by Homo
sapiens. [This means there are fewer checks-and-balances in nature to
offset the monumental impact human and livestock poop are having on the
Earth Microbiome]{.underline}. [We are filling the world with livestock
and human pathogens and bacteria, many of the microbes rendered
ultra-virulent or drug resistant by the barrage of antibiotics we and
our animals are subjected to.]{.underline} For example, [a super-toxic
form of E.coli bacteria has thrived in the antibiotic-saturated cattle
industry, and turned up killing wild deer. Wildlife all over the
world]{.underline}, from the depths of the seas to the Himalayas, [are
developing antibiotic-resistant bacterial diseases]{.underline}.
[Superbugs that are resistant to nearly every antibiotic on Earth are
bred,]{.underline} for example, [in pig farms in China, flow from sewage
systems or river dumps into the oceans, infecting fish.]{.underline}
[Seagulls feeding on those fish carry highly drug resistant bacteria all
over the world.]{.underline} Normal ocean microbes that convert sunlight
into oxygen that humans breathe form microscopic vessels packed with
their genes---including ones for drug resistance---that bob across the
seas, to be absorbed by ocean life, even seals and whales. The dangerous
organisms collect along any solid surfaces they come in contact with,
forming drug resistant biofilms in which genes for resistance are
swapped between microbes, even across species, making those biofilms
giant lending libraries of genetic tools for devastation of the Earth
Microbiome and, ultimately, human health. Proper wastewater treatment
can greatly reduce the threat to the environment, eliminating most
drug-resistant organisms. But most of the world's waste goes untreated.
Worse, cheap waste treatment -- the type used in most of the
world---basically mixes chlorine with poop, killing off bacteria. But
new research shows chlorine treatment can actually promote a surge in
antibiotic-resistant microbes, in a sense purifying the waste into a
form that is even more dangerous to the environment. So at a recent
meeting of the American Chemical Society scientists were told that,
"Treated wastewater is one of the major sources of pharmaceuticals and
antibiotics in the environment. Wastewater treatment facilities were not
designed to remove these drugs. The molecules are typically very stable
and do not easily get biodegraded. Instead, most just pass through the
treatment facility and into the aquatic environment." In China the
overuse of antibiotics, especially in animals, and failure to remove
them through standard wastewater treatment has gotten so bad that pure
amoxicillin and other antibiotics come right out of the tap, into home
drinking water. More than 60 different antibiotics has been found in
random samples of the Yangtze and Pearl Rivers. Downstream from
pharmaceutical plants in China antibiotics have been found in
concentrations that are 10,000 times above normal human treatment doses.
Extreme drug resistance genes have been found escaping wastewater
treatment from northern China to the Rocky Mountain streams and the
Hudson River alongside New York City. [Antibiotic resistant bacteria
hitchhike in dust plumes, and using human cargo and transport, spreading
across the terrestrial world. Birds poop them, honeybees spread them and
the impact on the Earth Microbiome is enormous]{.underline}. And so, as
the United Nations General Assembly convenes on September 21 to debate
measures aimed at preserving the utility of antibiotics to protect human
health, I wish they would consider the well-being of the entire planet.
[We are tempting fate every time a person takes antibiotics mistakenly
to treat a viral infection, a cow is fattened with pounds of "growth
promoters," a pool of salmon are dosed with antibiotics in aquaculture
settings and the daily kilotons of human waste pour into the world's
rivers and seas.]{.underline} I wish the UN and the political leaders of
the world would contemplate what killing off species of oxygen-producing
microbes, of methane-eating bacteria or of human gut beneficial microbes
will mean for the future of Earth.

For many years [the biotech industry has lobbied the European Commission
not to regulate products made using new GMO techniques]{.underline},
including 'genome editing' techniques such as CRISPR-Cas. Sidenote
However on 25 July 2018 the European Court of Justice ruled that such
genome editing procedures are GM techniques and its products must be
regulated as such. Since then, [industry and researchers have been
pushing hard to change the EU GMO law]{.underline} (2001/18[) in order
to get genome editing deregulated]{.underline} (ie with no risk
assessment, monitoring, or labelling).

But [there are two huge hurdles to overcome.]{.underline} First, [each
decision on GMOs in the EU is highly contested, therefore it will be
hard to find enough support to overhaul the EU GMO
regulations]{.underline}. Second, and connected to the first, **[public
support also has to be won.]{.underline}** Therefore, [wild promises are
being made about the alleged benefits of crops and animals which are
made using genome editing techniques]{.underline}, to convince the
public of their value. Similar promises were also made for GMOs in the
past, [but never proved true]{.underline}.

[The lobby tactics described in this briefing appear to firstly focus on
legal strategy, and secondly, to develop a positive PR narrative

a good example of the typical echo-chamber that comes with big industry
lobby campaigns, whereby decision makers are exposed to multiple voices
all bringing the same message. The lobby initiatives described in this
briefing appear to be driven by public research organisations, however
they have close ties to corporate interests.

Broad societal debate is essential

[The biotech industry and its allies are working hard to convince and
mislead the EU institutions into believing that the new generation of
GMOs are so safe that they do not require regulation]{.underline}. [They
are also spinning a tale that the new GMOs will succeed where previous
ones failed]{.underline}: in promoting a fair, socially just and
ecologically sustainable agriculture. If [the industrial lobby effort
succeeds, then new GMOs]{.underline} (plants, animals, fungi and
micro-**[organisms) will no longer undergo food and environmental safety
checks, nor be monitored or labeled.]{.underline}**

However, there are much more appropriate and innovative solutions
available to make agriculture more environment- and climate-friendly,
such as those developed by organic farmers and agro-ecology networks.
Crucial first steps for instance include the increased use of trees in
farming, more genetic diversity in crops and animals, localised
production, soil and water conservation, natural pest control, lighter
machines, more rotation of crops, and less intense animal rearing. This
will equally enable farmers to stop being dependent on expensive seeds
and polluting pesticides, as offered by Bayer, BASF, Corteva and
Syngenta.

The lobby campaign described here, that largely remained under the
radar, is [no less than an assault on the EU's environmental and
consumer protection legislation]{.underline}, which contradicts the
Commission's Farm to Fork ambitions for environmentally friendly
agriculture and consumer choice.

Environment and farming groups call on the EU institutions to ensure
that the 2018 ECJ ruling is fully implemented, thereby keeping new GMOs
covered by current safety controls and labeling rules. This topic will
be high on the EU agenda in the coming months, and it is crucial that
the the wider public is actively involved in this debate. **[The future

### 2NC - Link -- Unsustainable/Bad

#### Unsustainable 

Ray Cooper, 21, 7-9-2021, Farmers Trapped in Unsustainable Cycle by
Biotechnology, Seed Consolidation, National Sustainable Agriculture
Coalition,
https://sustainableagriculture.net/blog/farmers-trapped-in-unsustainable-cycle-by-biotechnology-seed-consolidation/,
6-28-2022

To remain profitable, multinational agribusiness companies must generate
and maintain a constant state, or at least a general trend, of
overproduction and depressed commodity prices. Input suppliers,
including biotechnology and seed corporations, can sell their patented
products to a client (farmers) always seeking to expand their
operations. Meanwhile, on the other end of harvest season, a
concentrated number of food processors are able to purchase commodities
for a price driven down by excess supply.

To illustrate the relationship, the following chart demonstrates that
corn yields increased rapidly during the decades that these corporations
amassed profit and influence -- multiplying almost 600 percent since the
mid-century dawn of the age of industrial agriculture and consolidation.

It is important to acknowledge that farmers may indeed experience
lucrative years and rising commodity prices, often due to increased
demand from international export markets. This is an exception, however;
it is not a rule. While farmers win on occasion in this system, it is
always as the industry collectively spirals downward.

Farmers who seek to permanently raise the price of commodities and
otherwise elevate their share of the food dollar find themselves
trapped. Realistically, corn farmers have few options to cut their input
costs with an industry as consolidated as seed and biotechnology. They
need to purchase the genetically engineered seed designed to withstand
the herbicides, pesticides, and synthetic fertilizer which they have
used for many growing seasons -- but use of these chemicals and
additional industrial practices, including mechanical tilling, erode
soil nutrients until non-GE strands may no longer be able to maintain
yields. The conventional farmer is not able to simply save and replant
GE seed to save input costs either, for it is protected under utility
patent law.

Similar to the biotechnology and seed industry, the farm equipment
sector is highly consolidated. Four companies, chief among them John
Deere, control at least 45 percent of global farm machinery sales. The
farmer who decides to increase their yield to make up for lost income
from falling prices may purchase new, productivity enhancing
technologies from these companies. Because this decision is invariably
made by thousands of farmers every planting season, with everyone
reasonably aiming to stabilize their bottom line, a renewed downward
pressure on prices is created. "The lower prices, in turn," according to
Darryl E. Ray in a 2003 University of Tennessee report, "become further
incentives to adopt more cost-reducing technologies, and prices continue
their slide."

Unless farmers are able to adopt sustainable farming practices or
radically alter their business models, they will continue to rely on
these patented products year after year, sending half of the checks they
write to increase the balance sheets of these corporations.

John Deere's revenue growth consistently outperforms farm incomes, even
as they rise and fall together. Large equipment manufacturers even use
patents to prevent farmers from repairing their own heavy machinery
(which is more damaging to soil health than previously thought) using
independent repair technicians, or continuing to maintain equipment that
is no longer supported by the manufacturer. This multiplies the profit
streams for companies and perpetuates the need for farmers to continue
to invest in the newest available equipment.

The imbalance does not stop there. In recent years, these industries
have been acquiring data technology companies to create programs like
Monsanto's Climate View, now owned by Bayer. Farmers who participate in
the program supply harvest field data through the sensors on combines
manufactured by John Deere and AgCo, which together control 70 percent
of the U.S. combine industry, and receive prescriptions sent back to the
combine advising farmers which Bayer products to purchase to maximize
their yields.

In his recent book, Perilous Bounty, Tom Philpott recounts an interview
with an ex-Monsanto executive who "painted a future in which farmers
would essentially outsource their decisions to Monsanto, or at least
rely on the company to narrow their choices dramatically... This could
empower farmers to make better decisions," he continued, "but the
farmers' interests and the industry's don't necessarily align."

Contrary to the vision of these corporate executives, basic economics
instructs that limiting supply would cause commodity prices that farmers
receive to rise. The industry, however, is unable to self-correct
because no platform exists for all farmers -- who are in competition
with one another -- to agree to cut production in a given year. Even if
that scaled coordination were possible, farmers might be pressured to
maintain or expand production to justify past investments in heavy
machinery or other inputs, and to avoid furloughing staff and laborers.
Further, the design of federal crop insurance and commodity programs
currently incentivize the maintenance of conventional farming models and
levels of production.

Federal crop insurance and commodity programs are designed to maximize
yields, directly serving the interests of multinational agribusiness
corporations who profit from maintaining a state of overproduction.
These subsidies enable the biggest industrial operations to get bigger
at the expense of smaller producers, as benefits are siphoned to a
limited number of commodity crops and a relatively small number of
farmers. The artificial absence of risk for these farmers, as well as
bias against alternative operations from financial lending institutions,
inhibits what motivation might otherwise exist to adopt diversified
production systems as a risk management strategy.

That is why agribusiness lobbyists work to preserve federal support that
reduces crop insurance premiums and prevents payment limitations to
commodity subsidies. This arrangement maintains the incentive for
farmers to overproduce, while also enabling these agribusinesses to
signal that their relationship with farmers is indeed symbiotic, rather
than parasitic. In reality, however, the public benefits of commodity
programs are funneling potential resources away from farms and rural
communities. Currently, any farmer or landowner -- even
multimillionaires and billionaires not actively engaged in farming --
can receive unlimited premium subsidies.

As an added consequence, these programs have been fundamental to the
acceleration of rural depopulation and the consolidation of farmland.
This places small and mid-sized farms, or other low-resource, beginning,
and BIPOC farmers, at a competitive disadvantage when it comes to buying
land. According to a study by agricultural economists from Cornell
University and the University of Illinois, crop insurance contributed to
a four to nine percent increase in forage and rangeland values. Another
study that looked only at the impacts of direct payments eliminated by
the 2014 Farm Bill, found that those payments caused an increase of
about \$18 per acre in cropland value.

To demonstrate one facet of the impacts of farmland consolidation, 40
percent of farmland in the United States was rented from landowners in
2017. Farmers who do not own but only rent farmland are, sensibly, wary
against sinking heavy investments into land which they may be asked to
leave at the end of any contract period. This particularly affects small
and mid-sized, BIPOC, and beginning farmers who do not have the
resources to purchase land at inflated prices. This effectively traps
the next generation of farmers and would-be innovators, limiting them to
adhere to conventional and unsustainable practices supported by existing
farm infrastructure, or only modest and transferable investments.

#### Impact on BIPOC farmers

To many, the advent of the modern seed and biotechnology industry
represents the pinnacle of benevolent ingenuity for our food system.

There are certainly conversations to have about the role genetically
engineered crops play in increasing yields and boosting productivity of
agricultural land per-acre through the reduction of crop loss. However,
just as important but less present in mainstream conversations is a
frank consideration about whether those gains can be justified given the
adverse, long-term impacts that conventional farming has on people,
animals, and the land.

When these conversations are better informed by the growing number of
studies which point to the benefits of sustainable farming models, as
well as its scaleable potential, we are compelled to ask: "Is the status
quo worth defending?"

It could be, if the power imbalance between farmers, rural communities,
and multinational corporations did not breed adverse consequences for
the former. Recall that seed was once treated as public property and
openly shared -- not only in the 1800s, but for millennia on this
continent by Indigenous people. In addition, integrated crop-livestock
systems kept pests and weeds at bay while limiting soil disturbance to
preserve the microbial community and prevent erosion, among other
restorative benefits for soil health. No rising input costs or
potentially dangerous chemicals were necessary, unlike today.

In 2019, U.S. farmers spent \$118 billion to purchase seed and plants,
fertilizers, animal feed, and agricultural chemicals. The cost of total
farm input expenditures has increased almost \$80 billion since 2009, a
classic symptom of an industry that has become too concentrated. Bayer,
Corteva, Limagrain, Chem-China, and BASF exclude competitors with
control of at least 50 percent of the seed and agrochemicals markets by
raising the price of inputs for farmers (including with a novel
"technology fee") without risking their own market dominance.

To strictly analyze the cost of seed, consider that corn farmers who
paid \$26.65 per planted acre of seed in 1990 paid \$93.48 in 2019. This
represents a dramatic increase of roughly 350 percent, beyond the rate
of inflation, following the biotechnology merger-mania and the co-opting
of the seed industry.

Health and human consequences compound this financial loss, with all
such liabilities externalized by multinational corporations and placed
upon farmers and consumers. In 2015, the International Agency for
Research on Cancer classified the active ingredient in Bayer's Roundup,
glyphosate, as "probably carcinogenic to humans." Farmers and
farmworkers in proximity to glyphosate are potentially at-risk, as are
consumers who consume GE food with glyphosate residue. Though glyphosate
has since been banned or limited in dozens of countries, the
Environmental Protection Agency re-approved Roundup to be used in the
United States last year -- even as lawsuits from 46,800 plaintiffs
alleged personal injury from exposure to Bayer's glyphosate-based
products.

Bayer insisted that they would "defend the safety of glyphosate...
vigorously." Then, in February 2021 Bayer announced a \$2 billion
settlement to cover claims from individuals who developed cancer after
being exposed to Roundup. This settlement, reached in private
arbitration, is not an admission of guilt. Roundup not only remains on
the market but is still the weedkiller favored by farmers. What else
would conventional farmers use with their Roundup Ready seed?

Genetically engineered seed has indeed taken over. The Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) reports that GE soybeans comprise a stunning 94
percent of all soybeans planted in the United States, GE cotton accounts
for 94 percent of all cotton planted, and 92 percent of corn planted was
GE corn. The multinational corporations that produce and market these GE
seed varieties do not only place their products on the market but remove
non-GE varieties of seed inherited from acquired seed companies. The
result has been an alarming reduction in farmer choice -- despite the
illusion of many unique seed brands -- as well as the decimation of crop
biodiversity.

In 1983, a report by the Rural Advancement Foundation International
(RAFI-USA) revealed that the United States lost 93 percent of its
agricultural genetic diversity in the twentieth century. That was before
the consolidation of the seed and biotechnology industries in the
mid-1990s, and nationally the trend has continued. This genetic
uniformity poses a significant threat to the U.S. food supply. The more
that the agriculture sector relies on a few uniform, patented seed
varieties, the more susceptible these conventional farms become to
epidemic pathogens or unexpected climate events. (We saw what happened
during the Dust Bowl when traditional foodways were replaced with
industrial, monocrop farming.)

Rather than elevating the long-term resilience and security of our food
system, a 2019 AGree report notes that "the tendency for farmers to
specialize production to only a few commodities presents risks in the
event of any type of shock (e.g., extreme weather, disease or pest
outbreaks, price cycles, market fluctuations, etc.)."

### AT: Europe Won't Shift

#### Europe wants more GMOs

**Linnekin 22** \[Baylen Linnekin, Senior Fellow, food lawyer, scholar,
and adjunct law professor, 5-21-2022, "Britain Finally Relaxes GMO
Rules, but Advocates Want More Deregulation", Reason,
https://reason.com/2022/05/21/britain-finally-relaxes-gmo-rules-but-advocates-want-more-deregulation/,
6-28-2022\]

[The decision by the U.K. Parliament to relax rules around the planting
of some genetically modified crops in Britain is being celebrated this
week i]{.underline}n an excellent Observer editorial published by sister
publication The Guardian. (The papers share an owner.)

\"In an overpopulated, overheated world that desperately needs secure
food supplies and to limit emissions of carbon dioxide, \[anti-GMO\]
barriers should no longer be allowed to restrict progress,\" the editors
write. \"We urgently need solutions and Britain, one of the world\'s
leaders in animal and plant research, must be free to play a key role in
this agricultural revolution. [Blanket bans of genetically altered crops
and animals can be countenanced no longer.\"]{.underline}

In the works at least since Brexit, Britain warming toward GMOs comes at
a key moment, with the island facing record food prices due to
inflation, lingering supply-chain issues related to COVID-19, and
knock-on effects from Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine.

[Britain\'s deregulatory plans around GMO crops focus on gene editing, a
type of genetic modification that \"is heavily restricted in the EU.\"
Indeed, current European Union rules \"make gene editing for crops and
livestock almost impossible.\"]{.underline}

Britain\'s embrace of gene editing in agriculture places more
post-Brexit distance between it and the E.U. That\'s intentional[.
Indeed, the British government this week couched its GMO plans as part
of its overall goal to \"deliver on the promise of
Brexit.\"]{.underline}

It\'s also a good thing. As I explained in a 2019 column, the E.U.\'s
anti-GMO rules are ridiculously bad. Last year, seeking to begin to shed
those rules, the British government announced it would eliminate
\"existing costs and red tape\" to allow field trials of gene-edited
crops. [The change is part of a plan to \"allow far greater use of gene
editing in crops in the UK, and a redefinition in law of genetic
modification.\" Environment Secretary George Eustice said the plan is
intended to tackle a host of issues, including \"food security, climate
change\[,\] and biodiversity loss.\"]{.underline}

More details about the plans were revealed recently in the annual
Queen\'s Speech. Those plans include \"considering the next steps in
enabling gene-edited plants and plant products to be brought to
market.\" [The proposals were welcomed by farming and crop-science
advocates. Leading British scientists have also hailed the plans as
\"great news,\" \"very welcome,\" and \"pro-innovation.\"]{.underline}

Gene editing is most commonly associated with CRISPR, which boasts \"the
potential to be a pivotal innovation in the drive to feed the current
and growing world population.\" CRISPR technology \"uses a process known
as mutagenesis---turning on or off specific DNA that\'s present
naturally in an organism,\" I explained several years ago. On the other
hand, \"GMO crops are produced by genetic modification, also known as
transgenesis, which involves inserting DNA from one organism into
another.\"

It is the former, rather than the latter, that Britain is moving to
allow. That has some critics questioning the scope of regulatory reform
and pace of scientific progress. For example, while hailing the
loosening of restrictions, the Observer editorial also noted the scope
of reform is narrow and \"unsatisfactory[.\" They urge Britain to
overcome its \"misguided government thinking\" and allow the
introduction of other GMO crops and foods---not just those created by
gene editing.]{.underline}

BRUSSELS, April 29 (Reuters) - [The European Commission launched a
review of EU rules on genetically modified organisms (GMOs) on Thursday,

techniques to alter the genome of an organism should be governed by
existing EU rules on GMOs, [the Commission concluded that its 2001
legislation was \"not fit for purpose\".]{.underline}

Gene-editing technology targets specific genes within an organism to
promote certain characteristics or curb others, while genetic
modification involves transferring a gene from one kind of organism to
another.

[GMOs are rarely used for cultivation in the EU due to longstanding
fears of their environmental effects and some campaign groups say
gene-editing brings similar risks.]{.underline}

Biodiversity

Where they are grown, [GM crops occupy large surface areas and are
linked to intensive monoculture systems that wipe out other crop and
ecosystems. Growing only one kind of corn for human consumption will
mean a reduction in flavors, traditional knowledge and food
security.]{.underline}

Toxic Crops, Toxic Land

Most GM crops fall into one of two categories: either engineered to
resist chemical herbicides, or engineered to produce insecticides
themselves[. When herbicides are used on resistant crops, over time the
weeds develop resistance, leading to the use of even more
chemicals.]{.underline} Crops engineered to produce insecticides on the
other hand produce toxins that are not only harmful to pests but other
insects such as butterflies, moths and insect pollinators.

Corporate Control

[GM crops are patented, which allows a few multinational companies such
as Monsanto, Bayer, Syngenta, DuPont and Dow to control the entire GM
food chain]{.underline} -- from research to breeding to
commercialization of seeds. The multinational companies that patent and
produce GMO seeds control the majority of the seed market and often also
produce herbicides and fertilizers. [Patenting genetic material has
shifted the balance of economic power towards big business in their
aggressive pursuit of profit.]{.underline}

Threat to Small-Scale Farmers

[GM crops denature the role of farmers]{.underline}, who have always
improved and selected their own seeds. GM seeds are owned by
multinationals to whom the farmer must turn every new season, because,
like all commercial hybrids, second-generation GMOs do not give good
results. [It is also forbidden for farmers to try to improve the variety
without paying expensive royalties.]{.underline}

Furthermore, [farmers risk being sued by big corporations if their crops
are accidentally contaminated with patented GM crops]{.underline}.
Pollen from crops like oilseed rape is easily spread via wind and
insects to neighboring fields. Hundreds of these farmers in the US have
been sued by Monsanto, Syngenta, BASF and DuPont for illegally growing
patented crops.

[The role of small-scale agriculture in food sovereignty and security,
protection of local areas and economies, the preservation of landscape
and the sustainability is becoming increasingly clear to consumers,
governments and scientists. Governments should support these productions
instead of heeding to the demands of big business.]{.underline}

Food Culture

[GM products do not have historical or cultural links to a local
area]{.underline}. In Italy for example, a significant part of its
agricultural and food economy is based upon identity and the variety of
local products. Introducing anonymous products with no history would
weaken a system that also has close links to the tourism industry.

Health and Safety

Little is understood yet about the health effects of GMOs, but recent
studies have shown [animals fed with GM-containing feed can develop
health problems]{.underline}. In many parts of the world including the
EU, studies on GM crops can be carried out by the same companies who
product them, casting doubt on the quality and bias of data.

Hunger

[Multinationals promise that GMOs will feed the world, but since they
began to be marketed two decades ago, the number of starving people in
the world has only grown, just like the profits of the companies that
produce the seeds.]{.underline} In countries like Argentina and Brazil,
GM soy has swept away energy-providing crops like potatoes, corn, wheat
and millet on which the daily diet is based. The majority of GMO crops
are not destined to human food, but rather for animal feed, textiles and
biofuels[. GMOs have not increased productivity: data from the USA's
Department of Agriculture shows that there has been no recorded increase
in soya and corn yields since the introduction of GMOs.]{.underline}

[Continued industry promises about the ability of GM crops to tackle the
world's growing social problems are a myth: They have reduced
biodiversity, polluted landscapes, threatened the future of small-scale
farming and reduced the food security of the world's poorest people.
They have not fed the world, but rather concentrated profits and power
into the hands of a few ruthless companies. It's time to stop the big
scam.]{.underline}

"[The breadth and novelty of the antibacterial clinical-stage pipeline
is insufficient to meet the ongoing threat of wide-spread infection from
drug-resistant strains]{.underline}," the report concluded.

[Venture funding has lagged significantly for companies working on
antibiotics compared to the larger biotech industry.]{.underline}
Co-authors David Thomas and Chad Wessel, who lead the trade group's
industry research, found that from 2016-20, venture funding for
antimicrobial ucompanies increased 29% compared to the five years prior,
while funding for the biotech industry as a whole increased 175%.

For example, the study found 109 companies with assets focused in
oncology raised \$12 billion in the 10-year span ending 2020, compared
to \$700 million for just 12 biotechs working on antibacterials.

[The authors say the lack of investment has created a pipeline that is
not diverse enough,]{.underline} emblematic in the fact that only 18% of
antibiotics approvals have occurred this century.

Of the 64 antibacterial treatments currently in clinical trials, more
than 84% are for direct-acting novel chemical or biochemical entities.
But almost two-thirds of those have targets for which there's already a
marketed drug.

Some of the drugs in development include China-based biotech Sinovent\'s
XNW4107, which is being tested in with common antibacterials imipenem
and cilastatin to treat infections from resistant bacteria. Another,
Adaptive Phage Therapeutics, has a number of therapies in phase 1/2
trials for prosthetic joint infection, recurring urinary tract infection
and more.

[Biotech is an industry where innovation is buoyed by startups. More
than 80% of the new antibiotic drugs being tested come from small
companies, with large companies accounting for only eight of
them.]{.underline} The authors worry that large pharmaceutical companies
exiting the antibacterial market, coupled with a lack of licensing deals
and M&A activity, has scared off investors.

Struggling antibiotics developer Entasis Therapeutics disclosed earlier
this month it was fielding offers for a buyout at \$1.80 per share. The
share price hasn't jumped above \$4 in almost two years after the
company's IPO was priced at \$15 per share.

[The race for new treatments (or lack thereof) underscores the swift
pace at which antibiotics are overcoming existing
treatments]{.underline}. In a study published last month, a global team
of researchers funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the
Wellcome Trust estimated that more than 1.2 million deaths in 2019 were
attributed to bacterial antimicrobial resistance. Nearly three-quarters
of estimated attributable deaths were due to six pathogens, with E. coli
leading mortality.

In 2020, tuberculosis was the second-highest infectious disease killer
with roughly 10 million infected, behind COVID-19.

[Despite the lack of investment, regulators are eager to approve new
antibiotics. The authors calculated the rate of investigational new drug
applications for antibiotics resulting]{.underline} in FDA approval was
7.9% over a 10-year span ending 2020. That\'s about twice the success
rate compared to all other diseases reviewed by the agency. For
antibacterial new chemical entities, the rate was 16.3%.

Fear of gene transfer is also prominent in the debate surrounding GM
foods. When making new genes, antibiotic resistance is coupled with the
new genes since gene transfer is only successful in a few cells and a
marker is needed to identify successful transfers. The antibiotic
resistant cells are selected for further breeding and the resistance
stays with the new gene and is incorporated into the crop. The fear of
gene transfer comes from the potential of the genes from the GM foods to
be taken up by bacteria in the gut during gestation (6). The fact that
the new gene can and may interact with existing genes must be taken
seriously. If bacteria carrying antibiotic resistance genes cause
infection, they can be very difficult for doctors to treat (6). As a
precautionary measure, some experts say that antibiotic resistance genes
should not be used (6). A gene transfer could also result in the new
gene deactivating an existing gene, with dramatic consequences for human
health.

The environmental risks involved with GM crops are numerous. They
include the GMO's capability to escape and potentially introduce the
engineered genes into wild populations, the persistence of the gene
after the GMO has been harvested, the susceptibility of non-target
organisms (e.g. insects which are not pests) to the gene product, the
stability of the gene, the reduction in the spectrum of other plants
including loss of biodiversity, and the increased use of chemicals in
agriculture (3). The overall outstanding risk is the potential decrease
in the biodiversity of crops and their associated insects and animals,
shifting the forces of natural selection through direct human
intervention. The arms race that now exists between natural species and
the chemicals that we spray upon them hold the potential to give rise to
newer super-species that we may one day lose control of.

#### Antibiotic Resistance bad for population, economy, and health care

[Antibiotic-resistant infections are a substantial health and economic
burden to the U.S. health care system, as well as to patients and their
families.]{.underline}1 They commonly occur in hospitals, due to the
clustering of highly vulnerable patients, extensive use of invasive
procedures, and high rates of antibiotic use in this setting.1 Nearly
two million Americans per year develop HAIs, resulting in 99,000 deaths,
most due to [antibacterial-resistant pathogens]{.underline}.1 In 2006,
two common HAIs (sepsis and pneumonia) [were found to be responsible for
the deaths of nearly 50,000 Americans and cost the U.S. health care
system more than \$8 billion]{.underline}.1

[Antibiotic-resistant infections add considerable costs to the nation's
already overburdened health care system]{.underline}. When first-line
and then second-line antibiotic treatment options are limited or
unavailable, health care professionals may be forced to use antibiotics
that are more toxic to the patient and frequently more expensive.5,11
Even when effective treatments exist, data show that in most cases
patients with resistant infections require significantly longer hospital
stays, more doctors visits, and lengthier recuperations and experience a
higher incidence of long-term disability.5 The duration of hospital
stays for patients with antibiotic-resistant infections was found to be
prolonged by 6.4 to 12.7 days, [collectively adding an extra eight
million hospital days]{.underline}.1

Estimates regarding the medical cost per patient with an
antibiotic-resistant infection range from \$18,588 to \$29,069.1,14 [The
total economic burden placed on the U.S. economy by antibiotic-resistant
infections has been estimated to be as high as \$20 billion in health
care costs and \$35 billion a year in lost productivity]{.underline}.1
Antibiotic-resistant infections also burden families and communities due
to lost wages and health care costs.

#### Greatest existential risk

[According to the World Health Organization (WHO), resistance to
antibiotics and other types of antimicrobials is growing and represents
the single greatest challenge in infectious diseases today.]{.underline}
The WHO reported nearly half a million new cases of multidrug-resistant
tuberculosis across 100 countries in 2013, amounting to more than 20
percent of previously treatable tuberculosis cases now being resistant
to multiple drugs. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention estimates that each year, [at least 2 million people
become infected with bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics, and at
least 23,000 of them die. This inflicts a direct cost of \$20 billion on
the U.S. health care system.]{.underline} In the agricultural sector,
U.S. Food and Drug Administration sales data showed that drugmakers sold
more than 20 million pounds of medically important antibiotics for use
in food-producing animals in 2014---23 percent more than in 2009---the
most ever reported and more than twice the amount of antibiotics sold to
treat people.

[This is a global health crisis that knows no borders. Left unchecked,
antimicrobial resistance (AMR) will touch all people, regardless of
their nationality or their country's level of development.]{.underline}
[It will dangerously undermine health care as we know it,]{.underline}
making common procedures such as cancer chemotherapy or cesarean section
births---which depend on effective antibiotics to reduce their
risks---far more dangerous than they are today. [Indeed, by 2050, 10
million people a year could be dying as a result of AMR]{.underline}, up
from around 700,000 today, with China and India each being home to about
1 million affected patients. [And by then, an estimated \$100 trillion
in global GDP will have been lost.]{.underline}

Just as infections travel with the people who carry them, so does
resistance, so solving AMR is a shared responsibility[. AMR is one of
the biggest health threats facing the world]{.underline}, but it is not
beyond the world's ability to meet and conquer it, both economically and
scientifically. The global community must act together, and quickly, to
address the problem.

### Impact - ABR

#### Antibiotic resistance causes mass death -- cascading effects on treatment kill millions

**Kwon and Powederly 21** --  assistant professor in the Division of
Infectious Diseases in the Department of Medicine at the Washington
University School of Medicine; professor in the Division of Infectious
Diseases in the Department of Medicine at the Washington University
School of Medicine \[Jenny H., William G. "The post-antibiotic era is
here." Science, vol 373, issue 6554. 7/30/2021.\]

Imagine a world where routine surgery or chemotherapy is considered too
dangerous because there are no drugs to prevent or treat bacterial
[infections. Unless researchers develop new antibiotics and
therapeutics, the decimation of modern medicine will soon become a
reality.]{.underline} Scientists have long recognized that much stronger
incentives for research and development are needed to avoid this
scenario. **[Yet, the rise of "superbugs" has continued, making a
pandemic of antibiotic resistance a major threat to global
health.]{.underline}** One could blame slowed action against
antimicrobial resistance (AMR) on an upstaging by COVID-19. Health and
industry sectors deferred prepandemic AMR work to focus on tracking and
preventing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
transmission. Worldwide, scientists pivoted toward SARS-CoV-2 research.
This "all hands on deck" response was prudent but likely affected the
already lagging progress on battling AMR. What about efforts before
COVID-19? Prepandemic, experts noted that **[drug-resistant infections
could, annually, kill 10 million people worldwide by
2050]{.underline}**, and by [**2030, AMR could force up to 24 million
people into extreme poverty.** Reports from the United Nations, the
World Health Organization, and the UK and US governments promoted
renewed public health and research programs, including targeted
funding]{.underline} through the US National Institutes of Health and
the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, to develop
new drugs. Sadly, according to a March 2021 report by The Pew Charitable
Trusts, there are only 43 new antibiotics in development. Of these, 13
are in phase 3 clinical trials, and only about half of these might be
approved. It\'s no secret that the major problem is the lack of
private-sector interest in bringing novel antimicrobial therapies
through development. The war against AMR requires innovation, which is
costly. It typically takes 10 to 15 years to develop an antibiotic
through regulatory approval. According to the Pew report, among the 38
companies working on AMR, only two rank among the top 50 pharmaceutical
companies (by sales). And only about one in four developments represents
a novel drug class or a mechanism of action. We need new pharmaceutical
targets to combat microbial virulence, new methods to inhibit the
genetic transfer of antibiotic resistance between bacteria, new drugs
that bolster host immunity against AMR, and microbiota-based therapies.
To better track AMR, next-generation diagnostics are needed that use
whole-genome and metagenomic sequencing and molecular techniques to
detect AMR organisms in humans, animals, and the environment. Prior to
2020, the United States started paying attention to market-place
incentives that would rekindle private investment. In 2013, the US
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released its first
Antibiotics Resistance Threats report, which prompted a National Action
Plan for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria in 2015. Fortunately,
last October, the strategy was renewed for 5 years, directing federal
agencies to spur new drug development. Also, the Pioneering
Antimicrobial Subscriptions to End Upsurging Resistance (PASTEUR) Act
was reintroduced in Congress last month. If the bipartisan bill passes,
it will support a funding model that is not linked to sales, among other
economic incentives. Although the White House\'s fiscal year 2022 budget
plan leaves gaps in resources to address AMR, increases in health
security budgets could be directed at incentivizing drug development.
[Given that the CDC\'s 2019 Antibiotic Resistance Threats report
indicated **that 2.8 million Americans acquire infections caused by AMR
bacteria each year (with more than 35,000 resulting deaths**), the
government must do more to encourage private-sector
interest.]{.underline} COVID-19 has shown that it is possible to create
robust public-private partnerships across research, industry, and public
health that accelerate research and clinical trials and spur proactive
regulation in the context of a global public health threat.
Collaborative action is equally necessary to battle AMR. The Combating
Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria Biopharmaceutical Accelerator, a global
public-private partnership established in 2016, committed \$500 million,
through 2022, to support the development of new antibiotics and rapid
diagnostics to tackle AMR. We need many more such creative partnerships.
The scientific community should leverage lessons learned from COVID-19
to unite academia, industry, government, and policy-makers toward
preserving the benefits of modern medicine. Continued procrastination
will only lead to countless lives lost to AMR.

### Impact -- Soil 

#### GMOs destroy food security -- increase pesticide dependence, proliferate 'super-weeds' and drain valuable resources

**Soil Association** **20** British baised charity organization that
campaigns against intensive farming and emphasized local production
\["Stop Genetic Modification." The Soil Association. Nov 2020\]

[The GM industry has been promising for decades that genetically
modified crops will revolutionise farming, and even solve world hunger.
But none of their promises have come to fruition. **There is little if
anything to suggest the 'next generation' GM technology will be any
different.**]{.underline} Meanwhile, **[GM remains a distraction from
the critical issues facing food and farming]{.underline}** that can't
simply be solved by tweaking genes. What does GM really look like?
Nearly [all commercially released GM crops are produced by three
chemical companies]{.underline}: Monsanto, Syngenta, and Bayer. Despite
[the pro-GM lobby's promises that these products would lead to decreased
pesticide use, the truth has proven to be quite the opposite: The use of
Monsanto's glyphosate-based weedkiller, Round-up, has skyrocketed since
the introduction of glyphosate-resistant GM crops, becoming the most
used weed-killer in the world]{.underline}. The **[blanket spraying of
these weedkillers on GM crops is associated with environmental damage in
North and South America, from degraded soils to the loss of food plants
for wildlife such as the iconic Monarch butterfly.]{.underline}** And
**[these crops create herbicide-resistant 'superweeds', trapping farmers
into an increasingly expensive arms race where the only winners are the
chemical companies]{.underline}**. There is also a long history of these
GM crops contaminating other farms, which can be financially disastrous
and poses a huge problem for organic farmers. At present, there are no
commercial GM crops grown in the United Kingdom But we are still
supporting these GM systems by importing them for much of our animal
feed. If you buy: non-organic eggs, milk, yoghurt, cheese, meat or
farmed fish from UK supermarkets, the chances are the animals behind
those products were fed GM feed. **[We need a shift in priority to food
security]{.underline}** "[GM is a huge distraction. It is diverting a
massive amount of time, effort and attention from the really crucial
issues facing food and farming - like looking after our
soils.]{.underline} We have already [degraded 25 to 40% of soils
worldwide and unless we work very hard to reverse this damage, it will
be impossible to feed the growing population healthily]{.underline}.
**[GM is dangerous because it allows us to accelerate in the wrong
direction for a short while longer."]{.underline}** Helen Browning, Soil
Association Chief Executive We need to see a shift in priority to
solving our underlying food problems. Techno-fixes like gene editing
mustn't distract from this. We need to: regenerate soils, diversify
crops, use fewer chemicals, bring back wildlife and switch to foods that
are better for us and the planet. This needs a dramatic shift towards
farmer-led innovation and agroecology to create a climate and nature
friendly future. Currently farmer-led research sees less than 1% of
public research and development funding. Find out what our asks to the

#### Extinction

**Globe and Mail 7** John Allemang, feature writer, "Planet Earth has a
dirty little secret", May 12, Lexis Nexis

[[Dirt is disappearing, and **when it goes, we go.**]{.mark} It\'s a
simple fact that [we\'re using up]{.mark} our [finite supply of good
soil]{.mark} faster than it can be made, and whatever our eyes choose to
tell us, **[a crisis is looming]{.mark}**. Of course, like so much else
about dirt, even **[its do-or-die]{.mark}** crisis manages to be barely
perceptible. In a world prepared to welcome the inconvenient truths of
environmental degradation, and even make them the markers of
intellectual fashion, poor old untrendy dirt somehow falls to the bottom
of the global to-do list.]{.underline} Air pollution, water
contamination, the limited lifespan of fossil fuels, the urgent need to
confront climate change no matter how far away its worst threats may
be - we get it, whatever don\'t-worry governments and vested interests
like to pretend to the contrary¶ But erosion as the ultimate
catastrophe, the dusty death blow? Somehow it\'s hard to feel
apocalyptic about something you buy at a garden centre, scrape off your
boots before walking through the door or scrub off your lettuce before
the salad can be made.¶ \"We take it for granted,\" agrees David R.
Montgomery - which is a pretty hard admission for a man who has made it
his goal to alert a distracted world to the crisis of lost soil.¶ To his
practised eyes, at least, [the best part of the Earth is eroding and the
[danger signs are everywhere]{.mark}: bare plowed soil carried off by
wind or rain, rivers choked by sediment from clear-cut forests,
over-irrigated fields turned into salt-contaminated deserts, huge
unprotected tracts of wheat or corn dependent on chemical fertilizer to
replace the nutrients corporate agriculture discards,]{.underline} the
constant stripping of topsoil to create new suburbias. Our complacency
is so instinctive, our wastefulness so extreme, that Dr. Montgomery has
come up with a disturbing new name for modern agriculture: soil mining.¶
[\"We only have a fixed amount of soil - and we\'re digging it
up,\"]{.underline} he says.¶ Dr. Montgomery is a geomorphologist at the
University of Washington in Seattle, a well-travelled and well-read
monitor of Earth\'s thin skin who knows that a civilization\'s lifespan
depends on how it treats - or mistreats - its dirt. As a student of the
Earth\'s eons of slow but certain transformations, he is trained to spot
the big-picture inevitabilities the rest of us miss, and of this he is
certain: \"[[We\'re on track to lose]{.mark} most of our [agricultural
soils]{.mark}.]{.underline} And even if we solve the water crisis and
the climate crisis, [[if we don\'t conserve soil, then that will do us
in.]{.mark}\"]{.underline}¶ You hear that, and you look around at the
lushness of life in the spring, and the doomsday scenario seems
unconvincing. Dirt is everywhere, the fields are full of crops, the
supermarket shelves have their usual cornucopia look of gross
overabundance and, if there\'s a famine in a far-off place, as there
always is, can it really all come down to a few inches of topsoil that
has gone missing?¶ Yes is the short answer, according to Dr.
Montgomery\'s wide-ranging new book, Dirt: The Erosion of Civilizations,
which is to be published this week and has been deemed \"a compelling
manifesto\" by New Scientist magazine. He takes pains to demonstrate the
key role played by soil degradation in almost every civilization that
once claimed to dominate the Earth - a useful antidote to the Golden Age
nostalgia for a more harmonious past that afflicts many in the
environmental movement. Wrecking soil, he implies, is something humans
do, given the opportunity, because we\'re programmed to think of
immediate issues such as personal survival rather than forgoing our
inheritance to benefit the farmers of the future. And one reason we can
do this with a clear conscience is our belief that soil is everywhere.¶
\"People just don\'t realize that not all soils are good agricultural
soils,\" Dr. Montgomery says. \"And even with good soils, [the pace at
which it\'s being lost is slow by human standards even if it\'s quite
rapid by geologic standards.\"]{.underline}¶ You don\'t have to be a
geologist to spot the problem. At least since the Dust Bowl crisis of
the Depression era, when much of North America was blanketed by thick
clouds of soil eroded off the drought-ridden prairie, soil specialists
have put forward strong arguments for conservation - arguments that are
all the more crucial since the western plains, as Dr. Montgomery
observes, \"are one of the few places on the planet that can produce
agricultural surpluses and feed the world.\"¶ In the Canadian West, a
combination of high winds, heavy rains and years of drought has
compromised the region\'s high-quality soil (a gift of the glacier
action that collected and conveyed soil from the now-rocky Canadian
North). To reduce erosion, soil advocates try to persuade farmers to cut
down or even cut out the tilling (plowing) of the loose, granular soil,
maintain grassy ground cover, practise crop rotation, reduce chemical
fertilizer and pesticide use while making better use of manure,
introduce windbreaks and work the land along more natural contours.¶ As
the price of oil has climbed, making it much more expensive to operate
heavy farm machinery on a vast scale and spread fertilizer
extravagantly, the more sustainable approach to agriculture is gaining
converts in the West. No-till farming, in particular, has gone from
being a wacky agrarian fantasy to being a widely accepted practice for
those who want to maintain the industrial scale of agriculture while
conserving the soil by disturbing it less. \"Canada is leading the way
on no-till,\" Dr. Montgomery says, approvingly.¶ Concern about soil
isn\'t confined to the wide-open wheat fields: In tiny Prince Edward
Island, the potato industry faced bad publicity over the harmful effects
of soil runoff, and a provincial act now mandates crop rotation
(although critics point out that the government still permits a hefty
annual erosion rate of three tons of soil per acre). The island\'s fine
sandy loam has been identified as having huge potential for erosion due
to the heavy summer rains that wash away exposed soil from vulnerable
potato fields[. Even to those who see dirt as inexhaustible, all that
runoff is a problem: In a province where aquaculture is a major business
as well as a way of life, [pesticides and fertilizer]{.mark} nutrients
[from eroded soil **quickly upset the delicate environmental
balance**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### GMOs alter the soil ecosystem -- introduce foreign genes that effect species diversity and soil quality

**Guan et al 16** -- researcher in the Department of Life Sciences,

Zheng-Ping, Guan, Biao Liu, WeiWei. "Do genetically modified plants
affect adversely on soil microbial communities?" ScienceDirect.
3/15/16.\]

[Soil microorganisms play essential roles in agricultural production
systems. With the increase in cultivation of various GM
plants]{.underline} (e.g., insect-resistant or disease-resistant
plants), [soil microorganisms will be exposed to risks that may
eventually adversely affect agricultural production
systems.]{.underline} **[The introduction of foreign genes into GM
plants may affect species diversity and amounts of root exudates, alter
micro-ecological environments in the soil, and can strongly influence
the soil ecosystem functions]{.underline}**. Therefore, [the core effect
of growing GM plants on a soil is the change in soil ecosystem function,
especially the effects on the related microbial
communities]{.underline}. Some investigators believe that no inherent
connection exists between the diversity and function, and the abundance
of the species was found to not affect soil function substantially
(Bardgett, 2002). There is no direct evidence showing that soil
microbial diversity is related to soil ecosystem function. That is, a
decrease in microbial diversity does not necessarily worsen soil
ecosystem function, but the change in certain key species may matter
(Tilman et al., 2001). On the other hand, Bender et al. (2016)
[synthesized the potential of soil organisms to enhance ecosystem
service delivery and demonstrated that soil biodiversity promotes
multiple ecosystem functions simultaneousl]{.underline}y (i.e.,
ecosystem multifunctionality). Current techniques and methods may not be
effective enough to obtain the relevant evidence, or the available data
may be inadequate to draw such conclusions. For example, soil ecosystem
function may have correlations only with a few microbial species or show
functional redundancy (Loreau et al., 2001). Nevertheless, the species
abundance and diversity of soil microbes comprise an important reference
parameter in the system of safety evaluation for GM plants and may
represent a key element of the biosafety assessment of animal and plant
diversity.

### Impact - Food

#### Soil destruction decimates food security -- lowers production, raises prices, and causes cascading insecurity

**Pozza and Field 20** -- Research Associate at the the University of
Sydney Institute of Agriculture and School of Life and Environmental
Sciences; Professor of Global Soil Security & Soil Science Education at
the Unviersity of Sydeny \[Liana E.; Damien, J. "The Science of Soil
Secuirty and Food Security" ScienceDirect. 11/11/2020.\]

**[Without secure soil, nutritious food will be much harder to produce
into the foreseeable future, and how we access food influences the
relationship individuals and communities have with the
soil]{.underline}**. To visually demonstrate this, it is possible to map
the relationship between Food and Nutrition security and Soil Security,
in line with a subset of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (Fig. 4).

Fig 4 ommited

Fig. 4. Soil Security and the nexus between global existential
challenges and UN sustainable development goals. SDGs highlighted in
blue refer to goals common to both Soil Security and Food Security.

The realisation of Sustainable Development Goals (UN General Assembly,
2015) has been a major step in placing the importance of soil care on
the international agenda. Soil directly relates to seven of the goals,
with the remainder indirectly related through the contribution of soil
to ecosystem services (Keesstra et al., 2016). Those indicated by blue
boxes within Fig. 4 are goals which are related to both soil and food,
and thus highlight areas in which interactions between Soil Security and
Food and Nutrition Security lie. In this section we delve deeper into
such interactions which provide the basis of addressing key issues.

Natural factors such as climatic and environmental systems, and
[anthropogenic factors such as socioeconomic and political systems
affect the interaction between Food Security and Soil
Security]{.underline}; the perceived strength of these interactions are
identified in Table 1. Degree of interaction was based upon intensity of
literature findings and how the different dimensions are discussed. For
example, a paper [discussing soil salinity and cropping is strongly
related because food availability is heavily dependent upon the
condition of the soil.]{.underline} If interactions were strong, they
were denoted with an Asterix. Under each of the Food and Nutrition
security dimensions we discuss systematically the interaction with Soil
Security dimensions.

Table 1. omitted

5.1. Availability

**[Food production and forecasting is dependent upon understanding the
capability]{.underline}** (moderate interaction, Table 1) **[of the soil
to support certain agricultural systems]{.underline}** and functions. If
the soil is unable to support production, human intervention is often
used to overcome this, for example through irrigation, the addition of
fertiliser, or application of soil amendments. To reduce the need for
human intervention and inputs over time, agricultural uses for the soil,
where possible, should be tailored to the soil type, or its capability,
based upon what the soil is able to support, rather than the other way
around. This may sometimes be easier said than done, as land use or
management decisions may be politically motivated or driven by
commodification, often overriding best land management practices. To
achieve a shift is possible but will require a concerted effort from all
levels who derive their wealth from the land -- be it individuals,
organisations, or government.

Land suitability assessment is a useful approach to ensure the soil is
suited to its intended use, but the soil may be suitable for multiple
production systems, potentially leading to competition between the
different production systems -- a common dilemma today (Tilman et al.,
2009). A possible way to help inform policy and reduce the chance of
conflicting interests is by mapping of land versatility (Kidd et al.,
2015), which is influenced by the capability and condition of the soil.
To ensure fair decisions on land management and prevent negatively
impacting upon the soil, cooperation and communication is required
between all stakeholders to develop fair policy and support those
working on and living off the land.

As identified in the review of Food Security publications earlier,
[production of food for the rapidly growing population is partially
addressed by a move towards agricultural intensification. This
intensification is possible by increased application of synthetic
fertilisers and pesticides, and the selection of higher-yielding crop
varieties, often grown as a monoculture]{.underline} (Matson et al.,
1997). [The consequence in some areas has been the decline in the soils
condition (strong interaction, Table 1), including loss of soil
structure, erosion, nutrient depletion and loss of biodiversity in the
soil (]{.underline}Tsiafouli et al., 2015). **[Decline in soil condition
in turn impacts upon agricultural productivity and diminishes natural
ecosystem services the landscape provides]{.underline}** (Squire et al.,
2015). To maintain ecosystem services and the condition of the soil,
rather than focussing on a single system, a broader landscape approach
is needed to allow for multiple systems and crops to coexist on the land
and preserve the condition of the soil (Lal, 2020; Landis, 2017; Pretty
et al., 2018).

The value of land is based on relative land prices, the production
potential and/or land evaluation approaches. Land evaluation and natural
capital assessment (weak interaction, Table 1) often only takes the
above-ground component of soil (i.e. the production potential) into
account, resulting in the soil being undervalued and overlooked in key
management and policy decisions (Hewitt et al., 2015). [Being overlooked
and not realising the full value of soil can lead to land degradation,
reduced productivity and economic losses.]{.underline} This is
illustrated by Kidd et al. (2015) who uses a gross margin approach
estimate the value derived from soil. This estimates the value of
agriculturally productive and effectively, but drastically
underestimates the world heritage protected National park that covers
much of the west of the state of Tasmania and provides significant
ecosystem and recreational services.

A multi-functional approach to evaluation of land through the soil is
more comprehensive (Dominati et al., 2010). The annual value of the soil
based on its extensive contribution to ecosystem services has been
estimated a USD\$11.38 trillion by McBratney et al. (2017b). We most
commonly view soil based upon its production value, but we need to move
beyond this if we want to secure food availability for the future.

[Food availability is inextricably linked to the relationship the grower
has with the land and how much control they have over management
decisions (sovereignty]{.underline}) (moderate interaction; Table 1).
The degree of sovereignty is driven by the type of tenure and ownership
the farmer possesses over the land. Land tenure regulates how the land
is used, and the rights of the grower to control and earn a living from
agricultural production (Ashley, 2016). If tenure is short or insecure,
farmers will be less likely to invest time and money into soil
conservation, new technology, and sustainable cropping systems (Besley,
1995; Fraser, 2004; Lovo, 2016).

**[Landscapes with soil capable of sustaining agro-ecosystems are
diminishing around the world, due to desertification, degradation, and
urban expansion]{.underline}** (Pacheco et al., 2018). With the aim to
prevent further degradation, numerous countries have taken measures to
govern (strong interaction, Table 1) land use through the establishment
of a land classification system, for example Land Environments of New
Zealand classification (LENZ; Manaaki Whenua -- Landcare Research
(2019)), Biophysical Strategic Agricultural Land (BSAL; NSW Government
(2019)), and the Provisional Agricultural Land Classification in England
and Wales (ALC; Natural England, 2019). These guidelines have been
established for differing reasons; in Australia the aim of BSAL is to
protect arable land from mining, New Zealand\'s classification system
has been established to protect biodiversity and England\'s Agricultural
land classification has been established to protect arable land from
urban expansion.

Urban expansion in many regions is uncontrolled or favoured over
agricultural production (Hu et al., 2018; Radwan et al., 2019). To
ensure food availability and associated ecosystem services for the
future, rather than burying arable land under concrete and moving on we
need to explore alternatives. The concept of land degradation neutrality
aims to maintain a stable source of ecosystem services and food
production, either by preventing degradation and loss, or reversing
degradation (Cowie et al., 2018). Degraded sites are a result of
overexploitation and are areas in which the soil quality has diminished
or heavily eroded beyond economical use (Behrend, 2016), or the site
could be heavily contaminated. By remediating heavily degraded land per
hectare of valuable land lost, we are on the path to maintaining stable
food production and ecosystem services.

5.2. Access (direct)

In this paper we consider people\'s access to food either indirectly
through their local market or supermarket (indirect), or they may be
smallholder/subsistence farmer (direct).

For subsistence farmers and their families, [access to food is directly
related to the capability of the soil]{.underline} (weak interaction,
Table 1). [If the soil is of poor quality, unable to support diverse
crops]{.underline}, or if their allotment is simply not large enough,
**[farmers and their families will not have access to a sufficient
quantity and quality of food.]{.underline}** This stress may be
alleviated if farmers have access to markets, however those in rural or
remote areas may not.

The condition of the soil (weak interaction, Table 1) ensuring
sufficient access involves the adopting of sustainable management and
adapting to the changing climate and is achievable, but more work and
support is needed to aid the adoption of these practices (Chivasa, 2019;
Yahaya et al., 2018). If not addressed, and if the changes in condition
are significant enough, irreversible changes to soil capability may
occur, impacting ability to adapt and forcing farmers off their land to
more populated areas as environmental refugees (Bernzen et al., 2019;
Myers, 2002).

Access by subsistence farmers to food provides sustenance and an income,
so they already place a high value on the soil. In many cases, farmers
also understand the importance of services provided by ecosystems
surrounding and within their agricultural system (Kandel et al., 2018).
Placing a higher value on ecosystem services (disconnection, Table 1)
and striving to maintain diversity within the soil environment would
enable greater production, crop quality and nutritional value, therefore
increasing the farmer\'s income and wellbeing.

In the earlier review the access to land tenure significantly increases
connectivity between subsistence farmers and the soil (weak interaction,
Table 1), influencing their key land management decisions (Ding, 2003;
Hartvigsen, 2014; Obeng-Odoom, 2012). Simultaneously, joining a local
co-operative can help ensure farmers receive a fair price for their
produce; however, more guidance by governments and NGOs is needed to
ensure resilience, as many co-operatives are short-lived or unsuccessful
(Borda-Rodriguez and Vicari, 2014[). Fairer pricing enables farmers to
make a greater profit, enabling them to afford a more diverse diet and
allowing them to invest in improved farming technologies and more
sustainable land management.]{.underline}

5.3. Access (indirect)

Many of the issues identified for subsistence farmers also impact those
indirectly deriving their food. **[The degradation of land reducing
capability of the soil, and poor soil condition, impact the value chain
and where food is sourced, impacting food availability and
prices]{.underline}** (D\'Odorico et al., 2014); [this may result in
economic losses for producers in the affected areas through loss of
trade]{.underline} (Gomiero, 2016; D\'Odorico et al., 2014). Meanwhile,
consumers are becoming more concerned about the provenance of their
food; being mindful of where the food has come from, the associated
impacts upon the environment, and ethical treatment of animals (Birch et
al., 2018).

#### Food security and soil security are intrinsically linked -- decimation of soil has cascading effects for global food supply

**Pozza and Field 20** -- Research Associate at the the University of
Sydney Institute of Agriculture and School of Life and Environmental
Sciences; Professor of Global Soil Security & Soil Science Education at
the Unviersity of Sydeny \[Liana E.; Damien, J. "The Science of Soil
Secuirty and Food Security" ScienceDirect. 11/11/2020.\]

**[Food and Nutrition Security are intrinsically linked to the
soil]{.underline}**. Trying to accommodate [growing food
demand]{.underline} through unsustainable intensification and management
practices [is degrading the soil and we are running out of [arable
land](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/arable-land)]{.underline}.
To avoid further degradation, land needs to be used based upon what it
can do. We need to care for the soil and take measures to maintain its
capability and condition, or work to restore what has been lost through
regenerative agriculture. [The way people connect to the soil influences
management decisions and consumer choices.]{.underline} Education helps
people connect and understand their impact upon the soil, while policy
and governance ensures continued protection, regeneration, and
sustainable management of the soil. Obtaining Food Security is difficult
if we do not have healthy soils to support production. In urban areas we
are less connected to the soil but are still heavily reliant upon it.
Subsistence farmers, who possess a more direct connection to the soil
are most sensitive to poor soil condition. In terms of utilisation, our
nutrition and health come from the soil -- if the soil in which our
produce is grown lacks the micronutrients we need, such as Zinc and
Copper, then we will be deficient.

[The dimensions of Soil Security are well-defined, but require further
thought and research on potential indicators of connectivity. In
contrast, the dimensions of Food Security have clear definitions, but
they are harder to assess, so development of more consistent assessment
is needed, or potentially a way to use Soil Security as a proxy measure
in the meantime.]{.underline}

**[Agricultural systems are highly variable, depending on the natural
environment, socioeconomics and the political climate of a
region]{.underline}**. There is not a 'one solution fixes all' approach
and ways forward need to be investigated and innovation developed
accordingly.

### Impact - Biodiversity

#### Soil quality solves a laundry list of ecological impacts\-\--biodiversity, carbon sequestration, agricultural productivity

**IUCN 22 --**union of governmental and non-governmental organizations
specializing in conservation efforts \[International Union for
Conservation of Nature "Biodiversity and soil health: how protecting
one, safeguards the other." IUCN. 5/19/22\]

Resilient highlands project in Guatemala

[From nature-based solutions to climate, health issues, food and water
security, and sustainable livelihoods, biodiversity is the foundation
upon which we can build back better.]{.underline} **[A key premise of
building back better is a strong and solid foundation. That foundation
on planet earth is soil.]{.underline}**

[Healthy soil has the ability to sequester carbon and help reverse the
effects of climate change, it better absorbs and retains water, cutting
down on evaporation and creating resilience to drought and extreme
weather, it increases soil fertility and productivity, increases the
nutritional value of food and forage, supports greater biodiversity and
ensures species stability.]{.underline}

Altiplano, resilient highlands project, GuatemalaSoil hosts a quarter of
our planet's biodiversity. [Billions upon billions of earthworms,
nematodes, insects, fungi, bacteria, and other invertebrates make their
home in soil. These creatures use the organic material found in soil as
food and work together to break down materials into minerals and
nutrients that support healthy growth for the rest of the ecosystem,
including crops and animals on farms.]{.underline}

Yet, over half our agricultural soils are already degraded. [Soil
degradation is the physical, chemical and biological decline of soil
quality]{.underline}. Caused by unabated deforestation and urbanisation,
industrial pollution, overgrazing, and unsustainable agricultural
practices, this loss threatens our very survival. A change in farming
practices has never been more urgent.

Through evidence-based dialogue between the agriculture and conservation
sectors, IUCN is working on a large-scale Sustainable Agriculture and
Land Health Initiative to promote regenerative approaches that restore
and conserve biodiversity on farms and agricultural landscapes.

"Sustainable agriculture can feed the world while protecting the
environment that supports it. **[Agriculture depends on biodiversity, so
in order for agriculture to be sustainable, it must contribute to
conserving that biodiversity, particularly the soil which safeguards
ecosystems and their services]{.underline}**", said Jonathan Davies,
IUCN Senior Agriculture Advisor.

### AT: Feeds the Hungry

#### Gmos don't solve hunger 

Green America No Date\["GMOs Don't Feed the World", Green America,
<https://www.greenamerica.org/gmos-stop-ge-wheat/genetic-engineering-gmos/gmos-dont-feedworld#:~:text=The%20vast%20majority%20of%20GMO,%2C%20and%20self%2Dgenerate%20pesticides>.,
accessed 6-28-2022\]

[The vast majority of GMO crop production does not go towards direct
food consumption; rather, it is used for the production of animal feed
and ethanol]{.underline}. These are crops engineered to withstand, work
in partnership with, and self-generate pesticides. [They are not
engineered to increase yield or face climate-related challenges to
growth, such as drought tolerance.]{.underline} There is one variety of
corn has been bred for drought resistance, but it is likely to only be
effective in 15 percent of US corn fields and is not effective in severe
or extreme drought, which we are expected to have more of in the coming
years.

[Industrial agriculture isn\'t the answer.]{.underline}

[Increases in yield from GE crops are a result of a decrease in yield
lost to pests from Bt crops, pesticides, and an increase in fertilizer
use]{.underline} (made from petroleum, defeating the purpose of
ethanol[). Unfortunately, growing weed and pest resistance is already
decreasing their effectiveness, requiring much more dangerous pesticides
and making useless]{.underline} one of the most used organic pesticides,
Bt. These minimal increases in yield have come with major externalities,
including but not limited to water pollution, pollinator loss, and soil
degradation, that put future food security at risk. [After decades of
attempts, Big Biotech has not been successful in breeding GE seeds that
increase yield or reduce water use.]{.underline} Conventional breeding
outperforms genetic engineering when it comes to nitrogen use efficiency
(the ability for crops to pull nitrogen out of soil, developing a more
efficient use of fertilizer, ultimately decreasing the demand for
fertilizers) and water use efficiency (WUE).

Overall, conventional breeding is responsible for most of the successful
advances in yield. It also happens on a much shorter timeline at a much
lower cost. [Industry studies show that it takes a minimum of ten years
to develop a GE crop and nearly \$150 million; whereas conventional
crops take only \$1 million to develop,]{.underline} improvements WUE
and drought resistance naturally occur at an estimated 1 percent each
year. [While Big Biotech develop GMOs in a lab, farmers are improving
traditional crops in the field]{.underline}. Due to this drag rate by
the time GE crops are finally released they are actually behind their
conventional counterparts.

[Conventional crops could also be more effectively bred to work in
partnership with the cultural food needs and geographical climate and
soil challenges unique to specific regions.]{.underline} Forcing GE
crops into developing countries with higher existing biodiversity puts
that biodiversity and future food supplies at risk by threatening native
species and practices. There are an abundance of types of crop varieties
(both already in use and wild) accessible to breeders and growers[. It
is important that we tap into this vast resource to expand nutrient
diversity and accessibility.]{.underline}

### AT: Safe

#### They won't be developed safety -- the EU lacks a regulatory framework. 

**CEO 2021** - Corporate Europe Observatory has been tracking the
industry's lobby attempts to get new GM techniques deregulated since
2015\
\[\"Derailing EU rules on new GMOs,\" Mar 29,
https://corporateeurope.org/en/2021/03/derailing-eu-rules-new-gmos\]

[The January 2020 report's conclusions show that a quick fix-approach to
deregulate genome editing products is seen as necessary -- "to be
competitive globally"-- but not enough]{.underline}. At least [some of
the participants aim for "a long-term paradigm shift" towards
legislation that is product-based.]{.underline} [This would mean that
GMOs would only be assessed looking at their new trait]{.underline}, not
taking into account the process (ie the technique) by which they were
created. Sidenote

[Officials were told that if GM regulations were lifted, "other
regulations exist that will still ensure safety".]{.underline}
**[However,]{.underline}** [these other regulations]{.underline} (such

environmental aspects as the GM risk assessment does,]{.underline}
according to this analysis commissioned by the German Federal Agency for
Nature Conservation.

### AT: Aff epistemology

#### Narratives of GMO effectiveness prop up the agribusiness industry -- lock in low food and environmental standards, degrade soil, and hurt small farmers

**Soil Association** **20** British baised charity organization that
campaigns against intensive farming and emphasized local production
\["Stop Genetic Modification." The Soil Association. Nov 2020\]

Don't believe the hype: New GM techniques In July 2018, the European
Court of Justice ruled that new genetic editing techniques count as GM
and must be properly regulated. We welcomed this move. These newer
techniques, which include so-called 'gene editing', continue to be
regulated as GM in the UK following Brexit. In 2019/20, the Government
announced an aspiration to change this, particularly for new techniques
which interfere with DNA, but do not insert genes from foreign species.
But [GM has a track record of failing to deliver. We are told that GM
foods are needed to feed our growing population and to meet the
challenges of climate change and pests, yet real world experience has
shown that GM crops have not lived up to their promises]{.underline}.
This booklet from Claire Robinson (Editor of GMWatch.org) and produced
by the Sheepdrove Trust (pdf, 20mb) debunks the myths spread by the
producers of GM products and the chemicals they rely on. **[These newer
technologies, like 'old GM' are perfectly suited to distract from what
is really needed, and to end up concentrating corporate control, putting
big agribusiness firmly in the driving seat]{.underline}**. [We only
have to look at the US and Brazil to see what direction GM takes us in -
low food and environmental standards, farmers faced with degraded soils
that are far from resilient to climate change, and wildlife in
crisis.]{.underline} What are the risks of genetic modification? 'This
is a bottle that once opened, cannot be closed. To check the contents
first, mistakes and all, is just scientific common sense'. All GM
techniques, new and old, should remain subject to risk assessment,
traceability and labelling to ensure farmer choice, consumer choice and
the safeguarding of health & environment. Regulation is needed not only
for novel traits, but also for the process of DNA interference itself.
DNA interference is something all GM techniques do, including gene
editing. It raises a great deal of scientific uncertainty. [Recent
research has raised more questions than answers, highlighting unexpected
effects in all editing techniques, in the form of DNA errors and changes
in gene expression. The repercussions are not well
understood.]{.underline} Newer 'gene editing' techniques raise another
level of uncertainty given their completely novel ability to do a large
number of different edits, allowing changes to quickly accumulate.
Organic food and farming Organic standards adopt a precautionary
approach to new technologies and prohibit GM. The organic sector must be
given the possibility and capacity to remain GMO-free. [To protect the
income and livelihoods of organic farmers and processors, all
contamination of non-GMO materials should be prevented by the GMO
producer in line with the polluter pays principle.]{.underline}

## DA/Turn - China Biotech Good

### Biotech Neg- China won't follow on

### 1NC -- Innovation 

#### Competitive engagement with China over biotech stifles innovation

**Moore and Coplin 22** (Scott Moore and Abigail Coplin, "Closing the
U.S. to Chinese Biotech Would Do Far More Harm Than Good", China File,

WC-NAS)

[China is fast becoming a biotechnology powerhouse and a perceived
threat to the longstanding dominance of the United States in the
sector]{.underline}. In Washington, these developments have been greeted
in much the same way as [China's growing prowess in artificial
intelligence and other emerging technologies: with panic and punitive
measures]{.underline}. Last May, Florida Republican Senator Marco Rubio
introduced the [Genomics Data Security
Act](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/BILLS-117s1744is/pdf/BILLS-117s1744is.pdf),
which would, among other actions, ban the National Institutes of Health
from funding China-affiliated entities. In September, Arkansas
Republican Senator Tom Cotton and Wisconsin Representative Mike
Gallagher [called](https://www.cotton.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/bgi_letter.pdf) for
"[blacklisting](https://www.cotton.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/bgi_letter.pdf)"
Chinese biotechnology companies over concerns they may be attempting to
gather biomedical information on U.S. citizens for nefarious purposes.
Just a few months later, the U.S.
government [sanctioned](https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2021-27406.pdf) 12
Chinese life sciences research institutes and 22 private firms on
security grounds.

[There is a big problem, however, with these largely reactive,
security-focused responses. Biotechnology is an intrinsically
transnational and rapidly evolving sector that holds just as much
promise for mutually beneficial collaboration and cooperation as for
competition and contention. These distinctive characteristics of
biotechnology mean that **Washington's security-driven approach to China
and biotechnology risks harming U.S. competitiveness in the sector
instead of enhancing it**, while also limiting America's ability to
share in the development of mutually-beneficial technologies and work
with Beijing to address the shared challenges posed by rapid
developments in fields like gene editing]{.underline}. U.S. policy and
strategy on China and biotechnology must strike a better balance between
addressing legitimate concerns while maintaining the openness and
innovation that underpin America's competitive advantage in emerging
technology.

Washington's recent focus on China and biotechnology reflects the
sector's rapid growth, both in China and elsewhere. Biotechnology has
been a focus of Beijing's scientific and technological development plans
since the 1980s, but more recently, [ambitious policy
goals](https://www.brookings.edu/research/chinas-role-in-the-global-biotechnology-sector-and-implications-for-us-policy/) have
spurred sharp increases in public and private investment into the
sector. Estimates of [state
investment](https://www.brookings.edu/research/chinas-role-in-the-global-biotechnology-sector-and-implications-for-us-policy/) in
the [biotechnology
sector](https://www.nature.com/articles/%20d41586-018-00542-3) over the
past decade reach as high as \$100 billion. In a [2020
speech](https://www.rfi.fr/cn/%E4%B8%AD%E5%9B%BD/20200916-%E4%B9%A0%E8%BF%91%E5%B9%B3%E4%BF%83%E7%94%9F%E7%89%A9%E7%A7%91%E6%8A%80%E8%A6%81%E8%87%AA%E5%B7%B1%E6%8E%8C%E6%8F%A1-%E7%94%A8%E4%B8%BE%E5%9B%BD%E4%BD%93%E5%88%B6%E7%AA%81%E7%A0%B4%E6%8A%80%E6%9C%AF),
Xi Jinping himself called for China to "master" biotechnology and mount
a "society-wide effort" to achieve breakthroughs in the field. The life
sciences, Xi went on to say, could be a "national treasure" that China
must "seize with its own hand."

Yet such statements belie the ways biotechnology differs from other
fields. Biotechnology intrinsically blurs boundaries between science and
commerce, market and state, the global and the national, and even
personal privacy and collective interest.
[Progress [depends](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.196.4322&rep=rep1&type=pdf) more
heavily in biotech than in other high-tech industries on knowledge
networks and transnational
collaboration, [especially](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/356/6339/696.2.abstract) those
that connect the United States and China.]{.underline}

A raft of studies on scientific and technological innovation conducted
over the past two decades demonstrate that the ability of individual
researchers to collaborate with firms and institutions in different
countries significantly increases the quality of their work, especially
when the collaboration
is [between](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aan5197) U.S.
and Chinese researchers, and especially in the [field of
biotechnology](https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fi1.rgstatic.net%2Fpublication%2F324472765_Mapping_microbiology_with_scientometrics_help_provide_a_clearer_vision_of_microbiology_research_around_the_globe%2Flinks%2F5ad5e29da6fdcc2935813414%2Flargepreview.png&imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.researchgate.net%2Fpublication%2F324472765_Mapping_microbiology_with_scientometrics_help_provide_a_clearer_vision_of_microbiology_research_around_the_globe&tbnid=MKhzUMjj6spg0M&vet=12ahUKEwi-7POBmrn1AhVpqHIEHV-tCgwQMygAegQIARAb..i&docid=h7ZYVjrdFWTxWM&w=850&h=1118&itg=1&q=Marcio%20L.%20Rodrigues%2C%20Leonardo%20Nimrichter%2C%20and%20Radames%20Cordero%2C%20%22The%20Benefits%20of%20Scientific%20Mobility%20and%20International%20Collaboration%2C%22%20FEMS%20Microbiology%20Letters%20363%20(2016)%3A%201-5&ved=2ahUKEwi-7POBmrn1AhVpqHIEHV-tCgwQMygAegQIARAb).
COVID-19 vaccines likewise provide a powerful example of how U.S.-China
knowledge networks help translate basic biotech research into commercial
and medical applications. [One of the key innovations underpinning the
development of Pfizer's and Moderna's mRNA vaccines---the stabilization

the research of Dr. Wang Nianshuang, a graduate of China's Tsinghua
University studying on a postdoctoral fellowship in the lab of Dr. Jason
McLellan at the University of Texas at Austin.]{.underline}

[Even in the realm of commercial biotechnology, the U.S. and Chinese
biotechnology sectors are more complementary than competitive.
Many [U.S.](https://bioduro-sundia.com/) and [Chinese](https://www.beigene.com/en-us) biotech
firms employ transnational business models that leverage the very
different strengths of the American and Chinese biotechnology
ecosystems]{.underline}, while many others---like BeiGene and

treatment options to patients in the U.S. and elsewhere]{.underline}.
Likewise, Chinese, American, and European firms all
regularly [license](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a9c785b70e80290e8ec1399/t/61f813b3ce78756a23b47880/1643647923437/220129+Press+Release_EdiGene+Arbor_FINAL.pdf) each

and [drugs](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/novartis-options-beigene-anti-cancer-therapy-1-billion-deal-2021-12-20/) as
part of their technological development and marketing strategies. The
corporate c-suites and scientific advisory boards of individual firms
likewise often consist of individuals of multiple nationalities with
experience working in both American and Chinese contexts. [Ultimately,
in both academic research and commercial science, the division between
American and Chinese biotechnology is less clear and less meaningful
than in other high-tech fields.]{.underline}

Biotechnology's reliance on basic science and transnational knowledge
networks also means that competition in biotechnology plays out
differently than it does in other high-tech industries. Unlike the
semiconductor and telecommunication sectors, whose development depends
on expensive equipment and hard-to-acquire manufacturing expertise,
barriers to entry in biotechnology are low. Likewise, as Eric Lander's
now
infamous [mapping](https://www.cell.com/action/showPdf?pii=S0092-8674%2815%2901705-5) of
CRISPR's development illustrates, both foundational research and key
innovations in biotechnology often take place in the public domain and
build on incremental advancements made across the globe. When
breakthroughs, like employing CRISPR as a means of gene-editing, do
occur
they [spread](https://www.science.org/content/article/its-crispr-revolution-china-becomes-world-leader-genome-editing) through
global scientific networks with little heed for national boundaries.
Consequently, it is not a zero-sum industry in which a single innovation
sets any firm or country ahead for a prolonged period. Take mRNA
vaccines as an example. Not only did Moderna and the international
Pfizer-BioNTech collaboration concurrently develop mRNA vaccines, China
is also currently finishing up phase three trials for its own mRNA
vaccine. In contrast to the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines,
however, the [Walvax-Suzhou Abogen-PLA Academy of Military Science
vaccine](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/chinas-mrna-covid-vaccine-candidates-2022-02-28/) is [thermostable](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/9/9/1033/htm) at
room temperature for seven days---a key advantage when trying to
vaccinate the developing world against COVID-19 and other diseases.

Given these dynamics, [the restrictive policy tools under discussion in
Washington pose serious risks to U.S. competitiveness in the sector.
While
policymakers [frame](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-26/biden-s-asia-czar-says-era-of-engagement-with-xi-s-china-is-over) "engagement"
and "competition" as opposing modalities of contending with China's
technological rise, maintaining an innovative edge in biotechnology
requires staying plugged in to international scientific networks and
engaged with one's competitors, regardless of whether they are domestic
or international]{.underline}. This is, after all, part of why the
biotechnology industry tends [to
develop](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.2189/asqu.2009.54.1.90?casa_token=iY9A77rxPmcAAAAA%3ArqTDJTJ4H9FB3uQwrQci_8p7mH8WETKMqQLbwcdo5oalT75AMdxAt8NHItvNrEHTTg-Qz87jg_J00g&) in
clusters. Similarly, [Japan's ongoing
struggle](https://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=24171) to grow its
biotechnology industry, given its [low level of
integration](https://commercialbiotechnology.com/index.php/jcb/article/view/837) into
global clinical research networks, highlights the potential perils of
constricting U.S.-China knowledge networks in the sector. Blocking
Chinese biotechnology companies from entering American markets is
unlikely to impede China's emergence as a major player in the industry,
but it does threaten to prevent American firms and researchers from
accessing the talent, ideas, and technologies these firms have to offer.
To decouple is to risk missing out, and thus risk falling behind.

#### Regulations are bad; even if positively intended, they lose us the tech race

**Ezell 21** (Stephen Ezell, "Going, Going, Gone? To Stay Competitive in
Biopharmaceuticals, America Must Learn From Its Semiconductor Mistakes",
Information Technology & Innovation Foundation,
<https://itif.org/publications/2021/11/22/going-going-gone-stay-competitive-biopharmaceuticals-america-must-learn-its/>)

U.S. leadership in advanced-technology industries is never guaranteed.
America once held dominant market shares in a long list of
industries---including consumer electronics, machine tools and robotics,
telecommunications equipment, and solar panels---only to see those leads
significantly erode, and in some cases evaporate entirely. And because
process and product innovation are so often joined at the hip, losing
production capacity to overseas competitors often leads to loss of U.S.
innovation capacity. Some contend it's acceptable to cede leadership in
innovation industries because America will just create new ones. But
intensifying global competition, notably from China, now makes such
indifference untenable.

America's loss of semiconductor manufacturing capacity (which has fallen
from 37 to 12 percent of global production over the past three decades)
and its lag in cutting-edge chip development both are due in significant
part to policy inattentiveness. This should serve as a warning for
policymakers: Failing to maintain a policy environment that nurtures
both innovation and domestic production capability risks sacrificing
U.S. leadership in other advanced-technology industries, such as
biopharmaceuticals.

ITIF's Analysis and Findings

America's experience with the semiconductor industry is especially
telling because it's an industry the United States wholly created and
led, yet it lost leadership to Japanese competitors in the late 1970s.
The industry recovered competitiveness in the 1980s, in part through
effective policies like SEMATECH and research and development (R&D) tax
credits, but once again allowed that position to erode over the
subsequent three decades, to such an extent that policymakers are now
calling for a \$50 billion investment in the form of CHIPS Act to
restore domestic semiconductor manufacturing capacity and innovation
capability.

The tenuous nature of U.S. leadership in advanced-technology industries
is also illustrated by America's experience with biopharmaceuticals.
Until the latter half of the 1970s, Europe led in this industry,
creating more than twice as many new-to-the-world drugs. But by the
2000s, that had shifted, and the United States led the world. This shift
was not due principally to differences in firm performance, but to a
suite of policies that made Europe less competitive: Stringent
regulations on biotechnology made Europe less attractive for biotech
drug developers. European regulations also significantly limited drug
company mergers, making it difficult for European firms to gain needed
scale as the industry started to globalize after the 1970s. Finally, and
most importantly, Europe began to impose stringent drug-price controls
that meant the U.S. competitors could earn and reinvest more in R&D.

It also helped that the United States adopted an array of favorable
policies, including increased funding for National Institutes of Health;
tax incentives to encourage biomedical investment; policies like the
Bayh-Dole Act to encourage biopharma technology transfer from
universities to companies. And unlike Europe, U.S. policymakers did not
impose draconian price controls, so innovators could earn sufficient
revenues to continue investing in future biomedical innovations.

By the 1990s, most experts in Europe were bemoaning the loss of EU
biopharma competitiveness to the United States. But competitive
advantage can be fleeting, and from 2003 to 2017 the United States lost
at least 22 percent of its drug manufacturing capacity. The COVID-19
pandemic revealed increasing U.S. dependence on foreign suppliers,
especially for many active pharmaceutical ingredients. And while the
United States is still the global leader in biopharma innovation---as
evidenced by the fact that the two most effective COVID-19 vaccines are
American---other nations, especially China, are beginning to challenge
that leadership. On top of this, many of the policies that enabled the
United States to wrest leadership from the EU are now under serious
threat---including the threats of stringent drug-price controls, weaker
intellectual property rights, and fewer tax incentives for new drug
development.

U.S. policymakers did not learn from a half-century of innovating and
then losing a host of advanced industries to foreign nations. But the
loss of competitive advantage in semiconductors can serve as a wake-up
call. The lesson should be that policymakers can never take the health
of America's advanced-technology industries for granted, or even worse,
impose policies that weaken that advantage. If they do, then the
all-too-real risk is that they will find themselves a decade later
having to contemplate a similar \$50 billion package to restore the
biopharmaceutical industry.

### 1NC - AT: Bioethics

#### China threat in biotech ethics is overhyped; they aren't a security threat

**Moore and Coplin 22** (Scott Moore and Abigail Coplin, "Closing the
U.S. to Chinese Biotech Would Do Far More Harm Than Good", China File,
April 8^th^ 2022,
<https://www.chinafile.com/reporting-opinion/viewpoint/closing-us-chinese-biotech-would-do-far-more-harm-good>,
WC-NAS)

Just as security-driven approaches stand at odds with many realities of
the biotechnology sector, [U.S. policymakers and politicians sometimes
mischaracterize and exoticize the threats that China's growing global
role in biotechnology pose to U.S. national security. These
mischaracterizations often take the form of highlighting behavior that
is hardly unique to China]{.underline}, and is, in fact, common in the
industry.
[Fears [expressed](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/china-has-done-human-testing-create-biologically-enhanced-super-soldiers-n1249914) by
some U.S. officials that Beijing is pursuing research in areas like
human genetic enhancement for military purposes, for instance, are
wildly exaggerated; such techniques lie [well
beyond](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-55905354) the realm of scientific
feasibility]{.underline}. Moreover,
while [links](https://ndupress.ndu.edu/Portals/68/Documents/prism/prism_8-3/prism_8-3_Kania_82-101.pdf) between
the People's Liberation Army (PLA) and Chinese biotechnology companies
and research institutes should be thoroughly investigated, **[not all
military-funded medical research and dual-use technologies constitute
security threats.]{.underline}** For instance, the media
has [problematized](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/health-china-bgi-dna/) BGI's
hearing loss research with the PLA, yet the American Department of
Defense [funds](https://cdmrp.army.mil/search.aspx) multiple hearing
loss projects at American academic and commercial medical institutions,
in addition to [countless other medical research projects on topics as
uncontroversial
as [ovarian](https://cdmrp.army.mil/search.aspx) cancer, [breast
cancer](https://cdmrp.army.mil/search.aspx),
and [lupus](https://cdmrp.army.mil/search.aspx). In both countries, many
military-funded dual-use projects in the biological sciences consist of
rather innocuous medical research, including [vaccine
development](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5247(21)00280-9/fulltext#%20).]{.underline}

[Another dubious concern is the growing collection of biomedical data by
Chinese firms operating abroad]{.underline}. Surreptitious collection of
personal medical data was highlighted last summer both by Senator [Tom
Cotton](https://www.cotton.senate.gov/news/press-releases/cotton-warns-of-risks-to-american-athletes-if-us-participates-in-beijing-olympic-games) and
in a [Reuters
report](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-china-bgi-dna-idUSKCN2ED1A6) finding
that BGI Group, a leading Chinese genomics firm, was collecting data
from millions of prenatal tests offered to pregnant women within and
outside China. [But the sort of collection undertaken by BGI, for
instance, does not appear to be illegal, or even out-of-line with the
practices of its foreign competitors]{.underline}. While BGI's data
collection efforts benefit from China's more centralized healthcare
provision system, using genetic diagnostic tests to build datasets is
the main business model of both the [direct-to-consumer testing
industry](https://www.barrons.com/articles/23andme-is-really-a-biotech-citi-says-51626108392) and
the clinical genetics industry globally. In fact, BGI's proclivity for
academic
research, [publishing](https://www.natureindex.com/institution-outputs/china/bgi/5139072d34d6b65e6a002189),
and international collaboration arguably renders some aspects of the
organization's data use more transparent than some of its international
counterparts.

[At the same time, U.S. policymakers' focus on surreptitious biomedical
collection by Chinese firms abroad risks obscuring a bigger challenge to
U.S. interests]{.underline}: Beijing's increasingly protectionist
approach to biomedical data-sharing. Thanks to its massive national
health insurance scheme, [China's state has access to [data
on](https://www.bmj.com/content/360/bmj.j5910) hundreds of millions of
individual patients. This data could be extremely valuable both for
medical research purposes and commercial applications, potentially
facilitating treatment discovery and development.]{.underline} Yet China
has adopted [strict
rules](http://www.gov.cn/zhengce/content/2019-06/10/content_5398829.htm) like
the 2019 Regulations on the Management of Human Genetic Resources,
requiring foreign firms, universities, and other entities to apply for
permission from the state to use Chinese biomedical data. While many of
these regulations have [existed since
1998](http://www.most.gov.cn/kjzc/gjkjzc/kjtjybz/201308/P020130823579540624649.pdf),
they have been
increasingly [enforced](https://technode.com/2018/10/29/bgi-denies-risk-concerning-dna-sequencing-data-leakage/) in
recent years and are now
being [implemented](http://www.most.gov.cn/tztg/202203/t20220322_179904.html) more
vigorously, resulting in [retracted
papers](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-0430-x) and [strained](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-07222-2)---if
not [cancelled](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/health-china-bgi-dna/)---international
collaborations. China's [2020 Biosecurity
Law](http://www.npc.gov.cn/npc/c30834/202010/bb3bee5122854893a69acf4005a66059.shtml) likewise
contains explicit claims of sovereignty over China's genetic and
biological resources. While such regulations are [not
unique](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1016/j.polsoc.2009.09.007?needAccess=true),
Beijing's massive store of biomedical data may create a significant
commercial and scientific advantage for Chinese biotechnology firms.
Washington must take this risk more seriously and push for greater
reciprocity.

Another legitimate worry is the perpetuation of human rights abuses tied
to genetic data collection within China's borders. Biomedical data, some
of it amassed and analyzed with
the [help](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/21/business/china-xinjiang-uighur-dna-thermo-fisher.html) of
U.S.-based researchers and [U.S.-origin
equipment](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/17/world/asia/China-DNA-surveillance.html),
has
been [gathered](https://www.aspi.org.au/report/genomic-surveillance) from
minority populations like the Uyghurs and large portions of the male Han
population without informed consent and used to compile massive genetic
databases. Journalists report that these databases are being used in
forensic DNA profiling and
potentially [phenotyping](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/03/business/china-dna-uighurs-xinjiang.html),
making it easier to identify members of minority groups and potentially
making them more susceptible to discriminatory surveillance or other
forms of state repression. Such practices deserve the condemnation of
the U.S. government and of the international community, and warrant a
firm policy response, including banning the export of biomedical
equipment to Chinese entities involved in such abuses. To its credit,
the Biden administration has attempted to curb these practices,
including through its [recent December
sanctions](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/12/17/2021-27406/addition-of-certain-entities-to-the-entity-list-and-revision-of-an-entry-on-the-entity-list).

Yet at the same time, Washington and Beijing have good reasons to see
certain areas of biotechnology as grounds for cooperation rather than
conflict or competition. The most advanced areas of biotechnology, like
gene editing and synthetic biology, are double-edged swords. They show
great promise to help cure chronic diseases and develop
drought-resistant crops, but also to create dangerous new viruses, human
genetic modifications, and even [genetically-engineered
terrorism](https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/our-work/pubs_archive/pubs-pdfs/2020/200218-CRISPR-Cautions.pdf).
The risks and threats posed by these emerging biotechnologies [cannot be
confined](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/11/08/cloning-crispr-he-jiankui-china-biotech-boom-could-transform-lives-destroy-them/) to
any one country. Potentially dangerous biotechnology research can be
undertaken virtually anywhere, meaning that all countries need to
develop and enforce rules preventing research that could create new
viruses or bioweapons, for example. China is an especially important
player in international biosafety and biosecurity, and the country's
2020 legislation on both topics is, on paper at least, among the [most
stringent](http://www.npc.gov.cn/npc/c30834/202010/bb3bee5122854893a69acf4005a66059.shtml) in
the world. Gene therapy trials based on somatic editing are underway in
both
the [U.S.](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01776-4) and [China](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/02/21/585336506/doctors-in-china-lead-race-to-treat-cancer-by-editing-genes),
and as researchers in both countries begin to tinker with the
fundamental building blocks of life, engagement on the use of these
groundbreaking, but potentially dangerous, technologies is needed both
to ensure transparency as well as to begin the difficult process of
establishing mutually-agreed rules and norms.

### 1NC -- China Sets Standards

#### China creates effective biotech standards independent of US leadership-- They're creating ethical international norms now

**Terry 22** (Mark Terry, "China Introduces Strict New Bioethics for
Genetics Materials", BioSpace, April 29^th^ 2022,
<https://www.biospace.com/article/china-introduces-new-bioethics-guidelines-for-genetics-materials/>,
WC-NAS)

[China
recently [outlined](https://geneticliteracyproject.org/2022/04/29/chinas-new-bioethics-rules-foreign-companies-prohibited-from-collecting-human-genetic-resources-inside-china/) new [proposals](https://global.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202204/15/WS6258b161a310fd2b29e57129.html) for
bioethics related to human genetic resources. Reportedly, these will
"clarify jurisdictions of regulatory bodies and enhance supervision
related to biopharmaceutical research."]{.underline}

[The country's new proposed rules define human genetic resources,
according to the Genetic Literacy Project, "as genetic materials,
including organs, tissues and cells, as well as genetic information,
such as the human genome and genes."]{.underline}

[The proposed guidelines also state that organizations and individuals
outside of China, as well as groups formed or controlled by foreign
stakeholders, cannot collect and preserve Chinese human genetic
resources inside China or take them outside of the country]{.underline}.
"The collection, storage and supply of Chinese human genetic resources
must be carried out by Chinese scientific research institutions,
universities, medical institutions and enterprises, it added."

The proposal was presented by the Chinese Ministry of Science and
Technology. It is currently in a public consultation phase. Last year,
the country's Biosecurity Law and Data Security Law both took effect.

For several decades, the U.S., Brazil, Japan and much of Europe have
bolstered their management of human genetic resources. Chu Jiayou,
former director of the Institute of Medical Biology of the [Chinese
Academy of Medical
Sciences](https://www.biospace.com/employer/550007/chinese-academy-of-medical-sciences/),
said, "This subject has gradually become a field with global strategic
importance."

The new rules could potentially affect a broad range of scientific
studies ranging from archaeology to agriculture to medicine. British law
firm Simmons & Simmons suggests it could hamper international
cooperation in biomedical research. [The rules also define a
foreign-controlled entity as any organization in which foreigners
(outside China) hold more than 50% of equity or wield significant
influence over decision-making, internal management and contracts or
arrangements.]{.underline}

The draft emphasizes data security associated with human genetic
resources. It appears to build on a regulatory framework on human
genetic resources China issued in 2019 by the State Council, China's
Cabinet.

The chief scientist of a Tianjin-based biotech company who requested
anonymity was quoted by China Daily, saying, "[It is a very instructive
and meticulous piece of regulation that will have a lasting impact on
how bio-research will be conducted in China and with global
partners]{.underline}. [Bioethics regarding human genetic research has
always been a pressing issue for the global biotechnology sector. I
believe China's latest effort to optimize its management of human
genetic resources will ensure the positive growth of its
bio-industry."]{.underline}

month with Seattle-based Seagen
Inc [(SGEN.O)](https://www.reuters.com/companies/SGEN.O) fits the
bill.]{.underline}

The agreement to co-develop cancer treatments using a RemeGen antibody
drug conjugate is regarded as one of the biggest of its kind between a
Chinese biotech and a Western firm. It provides for up to \$2.4 billion
in milestone payments, in addition to \$200 million upfront as well as
royalties if approved.

It is also at least the fifth out-licensing deal potentially worth more
than \$1 billion clinched by a Chinese biotech. Nearly all were signed
in the past year, underscoring China\'s still small but growing role in
developing innovative cancer drugs that will be used worldwide.

\"[China is clearly already an important and integral part of the global
biopharma industry, not a separate ecosystem]{.underline},\" said Franck
Le Deu, senior partner at consultancy McKinsey in Hong Kong.

China\'s government has made cancer treatments a top priority for the
industry. The world\'s most populous nation last year accounted for 30%
of cancer deaths globally and 24% of newly diagnosed cases, according to
one study.

[Supportive policies for the sector over the past five years are also
now bearing fruit and Western firms have come knocking at Chinese
biotech doors.]{.underline}

For Seagen, the RemeGen deal will allow it to directly challenge breast
cancer treatments from Roche

[More recently, China in 2017 and 2018 aligned regulatory standards with
international norms, rapidly speeding up the review system for new
drugs. The sector also has seen a surge in funding after Hong Kong\'s

China is gearing up to become a biotechnology powerhouse. Within the
past five years the [Chinese government is estimated to have invested
over \$100 billion in life sciences research and
development.]{.underline} Further signaling its determination, Beijing
is lavishing the sector with a host of fiscal incentives while
state-backed entities dish out largesse to promising startups.

[As biotechnologies rapidly proliferate, China---and other states---are
rushing to develop regulatory and ethical frameworks. The COVID-19
pandemic has raised the urgency of such efforts. To set parameters for
the evolving sector, Beijing has rolled out various
initiatives.]{.underline}

In 2017, the [Ministry of Science and Technology issued a series of
regulatory measures to streamline the management of biotechnology
research and development]{.underline} (R&D). Among the provisions was
the establishment of the National Biotechnology Research and Development
Safety Management Expert Committee. [The advisory board draws from a
broad swath of professionals: lawyers, economists, physicians, and
biologists. The purview of the committee includes developing inspection
practices, safety protocols and incident response
guidelines.]{.underline}

Tepid efforts to rein in rogue biotechnology R&D were jolted by
revelations of unethical gene-editing trials at the Shenzhen-based
Southern University of Science and Technology. The affair, commonly
referred to as the "CRISPR-baby scandal", centered on the experimental
endeavors of biophysicist He Jiankui. Applying the CRISPR--Cas9
gene-editing technique, He engineered mutations into human embryos in an
attempt to confer resistance to HIV. The edited embryos were
subsequently implanted into two recipients, resulting in several births.
Following this disclosure in 2018, the scandal swept China and the
globe, attracting public scrutiny and prompting a slew of ethical
questions. Seeking to deter future bouts of frankensteining, Beijing set
a firm precedent by indicting He for practicing illegal medicine. [In
2019, a Chinese court condemned the infamous biophysicist with a
three-year prison sentence, while two colleagues received lighter
sentences. The long-awaited verdicts marked the end of the gripping
saga. But the bioethical concerns kindled by the incident continue to
reverberate.]{.underline}

He's disregard for ethical principles for research involving human
subjects spurred Chinese lawmakers to curb unfettered biomedical
research. [As part of the regulatory drive, the Chinese Ministries of
Justice and Science and Technology released a revamped slate of codes
for administering the use of human genetic resources---and associated
data]{.underline}. The directives supersede earlier measures promulgated
in 1998. [The scope of the regulation package extends to the collection,
preservation, utilization and export of Chinese human genetic resources.
The rules, which came into effect in July 2019, also establish
procedures for obtaining research approval]{.underline}. Compliance
management is within the remit of provincial science and technical
administrative departments, according to article four of the
regulations.

While unveiling the genetic governance codes in March 2019, Justice
Minister Fu Zhenghua and Science and Technology Minister Wang Zhigang
touted the industrial advantages conferred by China's demographic
diversity. The cabinet members characterized vast, polyethnic gene pools
as a critical asset in propelling Chinese life sciences ambitions.
(Presently, Beijing is exploiting its genocide against Muslim minorities
in Xinjiang to develop, field, and assess a bevy of novel, disturbing
biotechnologies.)

[In the course of the press conference, the ministers also revealed the
government's intention to establish genetic registries across select
provinces, presaging the state-orchestrated gene harvesting campaigns
roiling China, and Xinjiang in particular. The accumulated data is set
to buoy Beijing's bulging surveillance capabilities.]{.underline}

Later that March, the Ministry of Science and Technology rolled out
fresh draft regulations for biotechnology R&D. [The draft establishes a
risk taxonomy---high, moderate or low risk---for assessing biotechnology
activities. Compliance requirements are specified for each risk
category. The document also proposes organizations adopt in-house
governance measures. To this end, the draft lists a series of
recommendations for institutions carrying out high-risk biotech R&D,
including having a detailed outline of research plans and methods,
instituting risk reduction measures, and creating emergency response
strategies.]{.underline} Institutions are also instructed to set up
biotechnology security commissions. These advisory committees are
charged with supervising the implementation of the aforementioned
policies. Intent to maintain tabs on its burgeoning biotechnology
industry, Beijing required security commissions to register with local
authorities.

Aiming to advance the ethical reckoning precipitated by the CRISPR-baby
scandal, Beijing also launched the National Science and Technology
Ethics Committee in July 2019. The committee is tasked with crafting
uniform ethical standards for emerging technologies. To date, its
primary focus areas are artificial intelligence and biomedicine.

The enduring COVID-19 crisis has also animated Chinese biosafety
concerns---and resolve. While addressing a session of the powerful
Central Comprehensive Deepening Reform Commission in February 2020,
Chinese President Xi Jinping pushed for the rapid crafting of biosafety
legislation and the establishment of biosecurity governance frameworks.
Xi also harped on incorporating biosecurity tenets into China's national
security strategy.

Despite mounting a regulatory embrace, Beijing's flagrant violation of
bioethics casts doubt on its sincerity. [As states navigate the fallout
of the COVID-19 pandemic, global biotechnology norms are set to be the
subject of greater discourse---and rivalry. Precedent suggests China may
seek to set standards that are in its own national
interest.]{.underline} Yet Beijing's margin to influence emerging norms
should be scrutinized and curtailed as a rebuke of its harrowing strand
of biotech-driven authoritarianism.

#### China has better regs than the US

**Chin 21** \[ Michael Chin, 2-10-2021, "China's New PRC Biosecurity
Law", Simmons & Simmons,
<https://www.simmons-simmons.com/en/publications/ckkz6vtxs14830a99h0xou5fo/china-s-new-prc-biosecurity-law>,
accessed 6-28-2022\]

Against the background of the outbreak of COVID-19, [the Standing
Committee of the PRC National People\'s Congress fast tracked the
passing of the PRC Biosecurity Law (\"Biosecurity Law\") on 17 October
2020 with the law to take effect on 15 April 2021.]{.underline}

[The Biosecurity Law seeks to cover a wide range of areas under a broad
definition of \"biosecurity\"]{.underline} and in doing so brings
together an existing piece meal set of regulations in the following
areas: [epidemic control of infectious diseases for humans, quarantines
for animals and plants; research, development, and application of
biology technology; establishment and security of pathological
microorganism labs; administration of human genetic resources and
biological resources; and prevention of bioterrorism and defending
threats of biological weapons.]{.underline}

Specifically and of importance to international players, the Biosecurity
Law further reinforces the importance China places on the administration
of human genetic resources (\"HGR\") by asserting sovereignty over
China\'s HGR and further strengthening current regulation over the
collection, preservation, use and provision of China\'s HGR under the
existing Regulation on the Administration of Human Genetic Resources
(\"HGRAC Regulation\", issued by State Council on 10 June 2019 and which
took effect on 1 July 2019).c

The Biosecurity Law adopts the same legal principles as provided in the
HGRAC Regulation (which remains effective unless expressly amended by
the Biosecurity Law) but introduces the following noteworthy changes:

[The HGRAC Regulation stipulates that prior approval]{.underline} of the
Ministry of Science and Technology of State Council (\"MOST\") is
required for the collection, preservation, utilization and provision to
foreign parties of China\'s HGR. [However the Biosecurity Law further
narrows the scope of permitted exemptions from this prior approval
requirement. For example, training is no longer a permitted
exemption.]{.underline}

[Both the Biosecurity Law and the HGRAC Regulation prohibits foreign
persons from collecting or preserving HGR in China]{.underline}, or
transferring China\'s HGR abroad, however foreign persons have limited
rights to carry out scientific research activities in collaboration with
Chinese parties using HGR as approved by MOST. However, for permitted
international scientific research collaboration activities with Chinese
parties based on HGR in China, the Biosecurity Law specifies that the
Chinese parties can participate in the research throughout the entire
process and in an essential way.

Legal liabilities and penalties are drastically increased under the
under the Biosecurity Law when compared with the HGRAC Regulation. [For
example, where illegal income is equal to or greater than RMB 1 million
violators can be subject to fines of up to 20 times the illegal income
and the authorities have the power to impose suspension orders of up to
5 years as well as revoke operation permits and licenses.]{.underline}

[Another significant development of the Biosecurity Law is the
introduction of an approval and recordal system for biotechnology R&D
and application. Specifically, it categorises biotechnology R&D
activities into high, medium or low risk categories determined based on
the risk of harm to public health, industrials, agriculture and ecology.
Foreign entities are prohibited from conducting high or medium risk
biotechnology R&D activities in China]{.underline}; in other words they
will need to be conducted by a legal entity in China and obtain the
necessary approval or recordal. Further details are still to be
released.

[For many years, Beijing took a hands-off approach to the technology
sector]{.underline}, willing to countenance the rapid growth of national
champions that provided convenient services to the population at home
and commanded respect on the world stage. [But now **the government has
changed tack, and for reasons that differ from those driving recent
regulatory moves in the West.**]{.underline}

"[Regulation of technology companies is tightening everywhere -- it's a
global trend. In practice, though, Chinese tech firms were already under
much more state influence than their counterparts in the US or
Europe.]{.underline} What we are seeing is more of a shift in emphasis
from the authorities," says Alistair Way, head of equities at Aviva
Investors.

"[Beijing is trying to balance the interests of China's national tech
champions with its own policy objectives. The factors behind this
regulatory tightening are threefold: The first is political, about
affirming who's in charge; the second is economic, and has to do with
stabilising the financial system; the third is the antitrust element,
motivated by concerns over competitiveness]{.underline}."

Start with the politics. [The clampdown on tech giants can be seen to
reflect the all-powerful central government under President Xi
Jinping]{.underline}, who has cemented control over the Communist Party
and the state since constitutional term limits on his office were
abolished in 2018.

[Xi has long been uncomfortable with the power wielded by billionaire
entrepreneurs such as Ma]{.underline}. At the G20 Summit in Hangzhou in
2016, visiting dignitaries divided their time between conferences with
Xi and audiences with Ma at Alibaba's headquarters, reportedly angering
the president, who felt upstaged.7

[Tech firms' sway over media platforms is a particular bone of
contention]{.underline}. Pro-Ant editorials on Alibaba-owned business
websites have been taken down in recent months, while Alibaba has also
been criticised for censoring gossip about its executives on social
media. As the state-run People's Daily put it in a recent article on the
subject: "It's astonishing how powerful \[Alibaba\] is in forming public
opinion."8

### \--xt No China Model 

#### China will not model US policy

**Ho 21** \[ Benjamin Ho, assistant professor in the China Programme at
the Institute of Defense and Strategic Studies at the S. Rajaratnam
School of International Studies, 8-25-2021,"Why China Will Not Cooperate
with the West: The Pandemic Made Things Worse", The National Interest,
<https://nationalinterest.org/feature/why-china-will-not-cooperate-west-pandemic-made-things-worse-190251?page=0%2C1>,
accessed 6-28-2022\]

Seen this way, it is not surprising that [China fundamentally does not
trust the United States. Not only does Beijing see Washington's
objective as wanting to keep it down and preserving its international
primacy, it also views the current Biden administration---and its
emphasis on democracy promotion---as an existential threat to its
political worldview.]{.underline} Indeed, Western criticisms of Beijing
on Xinjiang, Hong Kong, and Tibet all feed into the CCP's central
narrative: the United States and the West want to challenge the Party's
grip on power and to remake China in the image of the West. Such a siege
mentality means that [Beijing is unlikely to find any common ground with
the United States insofar as key strategic interests are
concerned.]{.underline} [Consequently, the CCP also views statements
made by the United States and the West as trying to drive a wedge
between itself and its citizens]{.underline}---which would effectively
destroy its sacralized image and its paramount leader that has been so
carefully and painstakingly built up over the years. Indeed, Chinese
political observers---in their recount of the fall of the Soviet
Union---often point not to Mikhail Gorbachev's glasnost and perestroika,
rather they attribute it to Nikita Khrushchev's denouncement of Stalin
as the start of the Soviet long decline. Unity is paramount to
preserving the sacralized image of the party, and the CCP will go all
out to defend this.

[The events of the coronavirus pandemic have further exacerbated the
tensions between China and the United States]{.underline}, not least
because of the sky-high implications that are at stake. Given that
[China wants to portray itself as a responsible nation, one that is
better than the West]{.underline}, it has spared no effort to promote
its vaccines worldwide, particularly in countries who for various
reasons are unable to procure the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines. While most
foreign ministers would prefer to defer knowledge of vaccine science to
health experts, in China, the foreign ministry has been on the forefront
of vaccine promotion. The implications are obvious: [Beijing sees
vaccine diplomacy as a crucial means with which to convince other
countries of its goodwill and friendship. Paired together with its Wolf
Warrior diplomacy, in which China seeks to rebut what it sees as unfair
allegations by unfriendly nations, Beijing intends to seize the moral
high ground to claim that it is superior to the West.]{.underline}

To this end, it is likely that Chinese leaders are aware that it is
being perceived somewhat in a negative light by its neighbors and they
see the need to remedy it. In a June 2021 politburo study session, Xi
exhorted party leaders to have better international communication in
order to repair the country's coronavirus-hit image and to win a battle
of narratives with the United States and its allies. [This is vital for
China especially in terms of cross-strait relations which are presently
at a low and which the possibility of conflict between Beijing and
Taipei cannot be ruled out. Indeed, if war happens, China would have to
demonstrate that it is the victim]{.underline}---either as a result of
Taiwan's intransigence---or [because of the United States interfering in
its internal affairs.]{.underline} While most countries in the region
are unlikely to want to be drawn into a hot conflict (with the exception
of Japan), the more China is able to present a positive image of itself,
the more likely it is able to convince its neighbors of its just cause
(jus bellum justum). This would increase both regional and international
pressure on the United States not to put boots on the ground and thus
further isolate Taipei from any external support.

### 1NC -- No Tech Race

#### China and American biotech can develop cooperatively.

**Moore and Coplin 22** (Scott Moore and Abigail Coplin, "Closing the
U.S. to Chinese Biotech Would Do Far More Harm Than Good", China File,
April 8^th^ 2022,
<https://www.chinafile.com/reporting-opinion/viewpoint/closing-us-chinese-biotech-would-do-far-more-harm-good>,
WC-NAS)

[China is fast becoming a biotechnology powerhouse and a perceived
threat to the longstanding dominance of the United States in the
sector.]{.underline} In Washington, these developments have been greeted
in much the same way as China's growing prowess in artificial
intelligence and other emerging technologies: with panic and punitive
measures. Last May, Florida Republican Senator Marco Rubio introduced
the [Genomics Data Security
Act](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/BILLS-117s1744is/pdf/BILLS-117s1744is.pdf),
which would, among other actions, ban the National Institutes of Health
from funding China-affiliated entities. In September, Arkansas
[Republican Senator Tom Cotton and Wisconsin Representative Mike
Gallagher [called](https://www.cotton.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/bgi_letter.pdf) for
"[blacklisting](https://www.cotton.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/bgi_letter.pdf)"
Chinese biotechnology companies over concerns they may be attempting to
gather biomedical information on U.S. citizens for nefarious purposes.
Just a few months later, the U.S.
government [sanctioned](https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2021-27406.pdf) 12
Chinese life sciences research institutes and 22 private firms on
security grounds.]{.underline}

[There is a big problem, however, with these largely reactive,
security-focused responses. Biotechnology is an intrinsically
transnational and rapidly evolving sector that holds just as much
promise for mutually beneficial collaboration and cooperation as for
competition and contention.]{.underline} These distinctive
characteristics of biotechnology mean that [Washington's security-driven
approach to China and biotechnology risks harming U.S. competitiveness
in the sector instead of enhancing it, while also limiting America's
ability to share in the development of mutually-beneficial
technologies]{.underline} and work with Beijing to address the shared
challenges posed by rapid developments in fields like gene editing.
[U.S. policy and strategy on China and biotechnology must strike a
better balance between addressing legitimate concerns while maintaining
the openness and innovation that underpin America's competitive
advantage in emerging technology.]{.underline}

Washington's recent focus on China and biotechnology reflects the
sector's rapid growth, both in China and elsewhere. Biotechnology has
been a focus of Beijing's scientific and technological development plans
since the 1980s, but more recently, [ambitious policy
goals](https://www.brookings.edu/research/chinas-role-in-the-global-biotechnology-sector-and-implications-for-us-policy/) have
spurred sharp increases in public and private investment into the
sector. Estimates of [state
investment](https://www.brookings.edu/research/chinas-role-in-the-global-biotechnology-sector-and-implications-for-us-policy/) in
the [biotechnology
sector](https://www.nature.com/articles/%20d41586-018-00542-3) over the
past decade reach as high as \$100 billion. In a [2020
speech](https://www.rfi.fr/cn/%E4%B8%AD%E5%9B%BD/20200916-%E4%B9%A0%E8%BF%91%E5%B9%B3%E4%BF%83%E7%94%9F%E7%89%A9%E7%A7%91%E6%8A%80%E8%A6%81%E8%87%AA%E5%B7%B1%E6%8E%8C%E6%8F%A1-%E7%94%A8%E4%B8%BE%E5%9B%BD%E4%BD%93%E5%88%B6%E7%AA%81%E7%A0%B4%E6%8A%80%E6%9C%AF),
Xi Jinping himself called for China to "master" biotechnology and mount
a "society-wide effort" to achieve breakthroughs in the field. The life
sciences, Xi went on to say, could be a "national treasure" that China
must "seize with its own hand."

Yet such statements belie the ways biotechnology differs from other
fields. Biotechnology intrinsically blurs boundaries between science and
commerce, market and state, the global and the national, and even
personal privacy and collective interest.
[Progress [depends](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.196.4322&rep=rep1&type=pdf) more
heavily in biotech than in other high-tech industries on knowledge
networks and transnational
collaboration, [especially](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/356/6339/696.2.abstract) those
that connect the United States and China.]{.underline}

[A raft of studies on scientific and technological innovation conducted
over the past two decades demonstrate that the ability of individual
researchers to collaborate with firms and institutions in different
countries significantly increases the quality of their work, especially
when the collaboration
is [between](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aan5197) U.S.
and Chinese researchers, and especially in the [field of
biotechnology](https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fi1.rgstatic.net%2Fpublication%2F324472765_Mapping_microbiology_with_scientometrics_help_provide_a_clearer_vision_of_microbiology_research_around_the_globe%2Flinks%2F5ad5e29da6fdcc2935813414%2Flargepreview.png&imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.researchgate.net%2Fpublication%2F324472765_Mapping_microbiology_with_scientometrics_help_provide_a_clearer_vision_of_microbiology_research_around_the_globe&tbnid=MKhzUMjj6spg0M&vet=12ahUKEwi-7POBmrn1AhVpqHIEHV-tCgwQMygAegQIARAb..i&docid=h7ZYVjrdFWTxWM&w=850&h=1118&itg=1&q=Marcio%20L.%20Rodrigues%2C%20Leonardo%20Nimrichter%2C%20and%20Radames%20Cordero%2C%20%22The%20Benefits%20of%20Scientific%20Mobility%20and%20International%20Collaboration%2C%22%20FEMS%20Microbiology%20Letters%20363%20(2016)%3A%201-5&ved=2ahUKEwi-7POBmrn1AhVpqHIEHV-tCgwQMygAegQIARAb).
COVID-19 vaccines likewise provide a powerful example of how U.S.-China
knowledge networks help translate basic biotech research into commercial
and medical applications.]{.underline} One of the key innovations
underpinning the development of Pfizer's and Moderna's mRNA
vaccines---the stabilization of the coronavirus spike
protein---[stemmed](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/727/transcript) from
the research of Dr. Wang Nianshuang, a graduate of China's Tsinghua
University studying on a postdoctoral fellowship in the lab of Dr. Jason
McLellan at the University of Texas at Austin.

Even in the realm of commercial biotechnology, [the U.S. and Chinese
biotechnology sectors are more complementary than
competitive.]{.underline}
Many [U.S.](https://bioduro-sundia.com/) and [Chinese](https://www.beigene.com/en-us) biotech
firms employ transnational business models that leverage the very
different strengths of the American and Chinese biotechnology
ecosystems, while many others---like BeiGene and Edigene---were
essentially "born global." Chinese biopharmaceutical
companies [harness](https://www.thewirechina.com/2021/10/10/biotechs-borders/) China's
large population of patients to conduct time- and cost-efficient
clinical trials that help inform U.S. regulatory approvals. Cancer drugs
developed by Chinese firms show [considerable
promise](https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-biotechs-lure-industry-talent-in-the-u-s-11560690000) in
lowering prices
and [offering](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210617005128/en/BeiGene-Announces-First-Patient-Dosed-in-Global-Phase-3-Trial-of-Anti-TIGIT-Antibody-Ociperlimab-in-Non-Small-Cell-Lung-Cancer) new
treatment options to patients in the U.S. and elsewhere. Likewise,
[Chinese, American, and European firms all
regularly [license](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a9c785b70e80290e8ec1399/t/61f813b3ce78756a23b47880/1643647923437/220129+Press+Release_EdiGene+Arbor_FINAL.pdf) each
other's technologies
and [drugs](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/novartis-options-beigene-anti-cancer-therapy-1-billion-deal-2021-12-20/) as
part of their technological development and marketing
strategies]{.underline}. The corporate c-suites and scientific advisory
boards of individual firms likewise often consist of individuals of
multiple nationalities with experience working in both American and
Chinese contexts. [Ultimately, in both academic research and commercial
science, the division between American and Chinese biotechnology is less
clear and less meaningful than in other high-tech fields.]{.underline}

Biotechnology's reliance on basic science and transnational knowledge
networks also means that [competition in biotechnology plays out
differently than it does in other high-tech industries]{.underline}.
Unlike the semiconductor and telecommunication sectors, whose
development depends on expensive equipment and hard-to-acquire
manufacturing expertise, [barriers to entry in biotechnology are
low.]{.underline} Likewise, as Eric Lander's now
infamous [mapping](https://www.cell.com/action/showPdf?pii=S0092-8674%2815%2901705-5) of
CRISPR's development illustrates, both foundational research and key
innovations in biotechnology often take place in the public domain and
build on incremental advancements made across the globe. When
breakthroughs, like employing CRISPR as a means of gene-editing, do
occur
they [spread](https://www.science.org/content/article/its-crispr-revolution-china-becomes-world-leader-genome-editing) through
global scientific networks with little heed for national boundaries.
[Consequently, it is not a zero-sum industry in which a single
innovation sets any firm or country ahead for a prolonged
period]{.underline}. Take mRNA vaccines as an example. Not only did
Moderna and the international Pfizer-BioNTech collaboration concurrently
develop mRNA vaccines, China is also currently finishing up phase three
trials for its own mRNA vaccine. In contrast to the Moderna and
Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines, however, the [Walvax-Suzhou Abogen-PLA Academy
of Military Science
vaccine](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/chinas-mrna-covid-vaccine-candidates-2022-02-28/) is [thermostable](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/9/9/1033/htm) at
room temperature for seven days---a key advantage when trying to
vaccinate the developing world against COVID-19 and other diseases.

[Given these dynamics, the restrictive policy tools under discussion in
Washington pose serious risks to U.S. competitiveness in the sector.
While
policymakers [frame](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-26/biden-s-asia-czar-says-era-of-engagement-with-xi-s-china-is-over) "engagement"
and "competition" as opposing modalities of contending with China's
technological rise, maintaining an innovative edge in biotechnology
requires staying plugged in to international scientific networks and
engaged with one's competitors, regardless of whether they are domestic
or international.]{.underline} This is, after all, part of why the
biotechnology industry tends [to
develop](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.2189/asqu.2009.54.1.90?casa_token=iY9A77rxPmcAAAAA%3ArqTDJTJ4H9FB3uQwrQci_8p7mH8WETKMqQLbwcdo5oalT75AMdxAt8NHItvNrEHTTg-Qz87jg_J00g&) in
clusters. Similarly, [Japan's ongoing
struggle](https://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=24171) to grow its
biotechnology industry, given its [low level of
integration](https://commercialbiotechnology.com/index.php/jcb/article/view/837) into
global clinical research networks, highlights the potential perils of
constricting U.S.-China knowledge networks in the sector. [Blocking
Chinese biotechnology companies from entering American markets is
unlikely to impede China's emergence as a major player in the industry,
but it does threaten to prevent American firms and researchers from
accessing the talent, ideas, and technologies these firms have to offer.
To decouple is to risk missing out, and thus risk falling
behind.]{.underline}

**ANKARA**

[Turkey\'s progress in the health sector is strategically critical
beyond its economic significance,]{.underline} the Turkish president
said on Saturday.

Congratulating the award recipients of the international biotechnology
congress BIO Turkey in Istanbul, Recep [Tayyip Erdogan in a letter
stressed the importance of the pharmaceutical industry for
Turkey]{.underline}

[Erdogan underlined that the sector was the most important after the
defense industry, emphasizing that during difficult times Turkey could
only rely on its own production and infrastructure to
survive.]{.underline}

\"However, we have unfortunately faced veiled resistance in our steps to
develop our domestic and national pharmaceutical industry and strengthen
our medical device sector, just as we once had in the defense
industry,\" he said.

Attending the ceremony, Vice President Fuat Oktay said that Turkey would
act against \"approaches\" that sought to compel domestic ventures to
move abroad even as the government attempted to bring research and
development, design and production facilities into the country.

[Inviting scientists, non-governmental organizations and universities to
support Turkey\'s biotechnology initiatives, Oktay said investments in
the defense, health and food industries would \"not only save us from
dependency but also turn Turkey into a global exporter]{.underline}.\"

Health Minister Fahrettin Koca also spoke at the ceremony, underscoring
the role of partnerships between academia, industry and individual
projects in training a qualified labor force.

After his speech, Koca presented a plaque of appreciation to the
representatives of the congress\'s sponsors.

[The **assault on human rights** and **the rule of law** presided over
by Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan continued during the Covid-19
pandemic.]{.underline} [The president's Justice and Development Party
(AKP) and an allied far-right party enjoy a parliamentary majority
enabling them to **consolidate authoritarian rule** by passing rushed
legislation that contravenes international human rights
obligations.]{.underline} Opposition parties remain sidelined under
Turkey's presidential system and the government has reshaped public and
state institutions to remove checks on power and to ensure benefits for
its own supporters. The political opposition nevertheless controls the
municipalities of Istanbul and Ankara.

[Executive interference in the judiciary and in prosecutorial decisions
are entrenched problems, reflected in the authorities' systematic
practice of detaining, prosecuting, and convicting on bogus and
overbroad terrorism and other charges, individuals the Erdoğan
government regards as critics or political opponents. Among those
targeted are journalists, opposition politicians, and activists---in
particular members of the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party
(HDP).]{.underline} The largest targeted group consists of those alleged
to have links with the movement headed by US-based Sunni cleric
Fethullah Gülen which Turkey deems a terrorist organization and calls
FETÖ and holds responsible for the July 2016 coup attempt.

Turkey's move to begin gas exploration in the East Mediterranean in the
context of maritime boundaries contested with Greece and Cyprus almost
spiraled into a naval clash with Greece in August. The European Union
has made efforts to broker dialogue over conflicting claims in a dispute
originally ignited by the discovery of gas reserves off Cyprus with its
contested status.

Turkey provides military support to the United Nations-recognized
Government of National Accord in Libya against a breakaway government in
the east of the country. Turkey has expressed strong support for
Azerbaijan in its conflict with Armenia over Nagorno-Karabakh. [Turkey
continues to exert effective control via Syrian non-state actors over
areas of northern and northeast Syria where it has intervened militarily
in the past four years, and where significant human rights abuses
continue unabated]{.underline}. Turkey cites its aim as removing Kurdish
forces formerly controlling the area closely linked to the armed
Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) with which Turkey has been engaged in a
decades'-long conflict (see Syria chapter). Turkey played a key role in
securing a March ceasefire in Syria's northwestern Idlib governorate,
which has largely held.

Freedom of Expression, Association, and Assembly

[Most TV and print media in Turkey are owned by companies close to the
Erdoğan presidency or avoid reporting critical of the
government]{.underline}. Critical online news and commentary websites
persist, nevertheless. At the time of writing, an estimated 87
journalists and media workers were in pretrial detention or serving
sentences for terrorism offenses because of their journalistic work.

Plans for strict regulation of social media companies in Turkey were
made law in July after President Erdoğan used the example of insults
against his family on social media to justify a need for stricter
regulation. Under the new law, social media companies with over one
million users a day will be required to have offices in Turkey and
comply with government demands to block and remove content or else face
very heavy fines. Companies that do not open an office will be fined and
eventually have their bandwidth restricted, rendering the platform
unusable. At time of writing, Facebook had indicated it would not comply
with the law.

While Turkey in January lifted a blocking order on Wikipedia in place
since April 2017, authorities continue to block thousands of websites,
including critical news websites, and order the removal of online
content.

[Thousands of people face arrest and prosecution for their social media
posts, typically charged with defamation, insulting the president, or
spreading terrorist propaganda]{.underline}. In the context of Covid-19,
the Interior Ministry announced that hundreds of people were under
criminal investigation or detained by police for social media postings
deemed to "create fear and panic" about the pandemic. Some of these
postings included criticism of the government's response to the
pandemic.

Turkey's official media regulation authority, the Radio and Television
Supreme Board (RTÜK), ordered arbitrary fines and temporary suspensions
of broadcasting of media outlets such as Halk TV, Tele 1 TV, and Fox TV,
which include content critical of the government. Netflix complied with
RTÜK's April demand that it remove an episode of TV drama series
Designated Survivor on the grounds that it offered a negative portrayal
of President Erdoğan, as well as in July canceling filming in Turkey of
a new Turkish drama after RTÜK requested the removal of a gay character
from the script.

[Selectively using Covid-19 as a pretext, provincial governors banned
peaceful protests of women's rights activists, healthcare workers,
lawyers, and political opposition parties.]{.underline}

Terrorism charges continue to be widely misused to restrict the rights
to free expression and association in the fourth year after the coup
attempt. As of July 2020, Ministry of Justice and Interior figures
stated that 58,409 were on trial and 132,954 still under criminal
investigation on terrorism in cases linked to the Gülen movement. Of
those 25,912 were held in prison on remand.

There are no published official numbers of prisoners held on remand or
convicted for alleged links with the PKK, although on the basis of the
previous years' figures the number is at least 8,500 and includes
elected politicians and journalists. An April law on early prisoner
release to reduce crowding in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic
excluded remand prisoners and all prisoners detained or convicted of
terrorism offenses. Covid-19 cases have been reported in prisons
throughout Turkey, although authorities do not provide numbers of
confirmed cases.

Human Rights Defenders, Lawyers

In February, an Istanbul court acquitted rights defender Osman Kavala
and nine others of "attempting to overthrow the government by force and
violence" in connection with the 2013 mass protests which began in Gezi
Park. However, hours after his acquittal another court ordered Kavala's
detention in the scope of an investigation into his alleged role in the
July 2016 attempted coup. In October, the investigation culminated in
another bogus indictment accusing Kavala and US academic Henri Barkey of
attempting to overthrow the constitutional order and espionage. Kavala
has been detained since November 2017, with Turkey flouting a European
Court of Human Rights' judgment ordering his release on the grounds that
his detention has been pursued for political aims.

In July, in a case against human rights defenders detained in 2017 while
they attended a training workshop, an Istanbul court convicted Taner
Kılıç, Amnesty International Turkey's honorary chair, on charges of
membership of a terrorist organization to over six years in prison. İdil
Eser, Amnesty Turkey's former director, and rights defenders Özlem
Dalkıran and Günal Kurşun received sentences of 25 months on charges of
aiding a terrorist organization, and 7 others, 2 of them foreign
nationals, were acquitted. All are at liberty and the case is under
appeal.

The government's restrictive approach to the public activities of
lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) rights groups continued
with the banning of events including Pride marches for a sixth year
running and homophobic speeches by senior state officials.

[The government in July passed a new law to reduce the institutional
strength of Turkey's largest bar associations, which have strongly
criticized Turkey's backsliding on human rights and the rule of law.
Defense lawyers representing defendants in terrorism prosecutions have
faced arrest and prosecution on the same charges as their
clients]{.underline}. In September, the Court of Cassation upheld the
conviction of 14 out of 18 lawyers for links with an outlawed leftist
organization. One of the lawyers, Ebru Timtik, died on August 27 after a
prolonged hunger strike in demand of a fair trial.

The first hearing against three police officers and a PKK militant
accused of the fatal shooting of human rights lawyer Tahir Elçi on
November 28, 2015, began in October with further hearings postponed
until March 2021.

From May to July, at least 45 Kurdish women's rights activists were
detained and face prosecution for links with the PKK. Femicide and
domestic abuse are significant problems in Turkey. While official
disaggregated data on numbers are not available, women's rights groups
have reported that hundreds of women are killed annually as a result of
domestic violence. Conservative groups and some government officials
suggested Turkey may withdraw from the Council of Europe Convention on
Preventing and Combatting Violence against Women and Domestic Violence
(the Istanbul Convention), which Turkey was among the first to ratify in
2014.

the past four years has set back Turkey's earlier progress in this
area]{.underline}. Those [targeted include people accused of political
and common crimes]{.underline}. [Prosecutors do not conduct meaningful
investigations into such allegations and there is a pervasive culture of
impunity for members of the security forces and public officials
implicated.]{.underline}

There have been no effective investigations into the around two dozen
reported cases of enforced disappearance over the past four years. In
February and June 2020, two men out of six who resurfaced in police
custody in Ankara months after disappearing in February 2019, stated in
court hearings that they had been abducted, tortured, and forced to sign
statements confessing to links with the Gülen movement.

In June, the government passed legislation to increase the numbers and
powers of night watchmen who assist the police with community policing
functions, granting them authority to stop and check IDs and to use
lethal force. There have been reported instances of watchmen abusing
their powers and ill-treating people.

The European Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT) has conducted
three visits to Turkey since the July 2016 coup attempt. In August, the
Turkish government granted permission for publication of two of the CPT
reports from 2017 and 2019 visits identifying ill-treatment in police
custody and degrading conditions and overcrowding in prisons.

Kurdish Conflict and Crackdown on Opposition

[While sporadic armed clashes between the military and the armed
Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) occur in Turkey's eastern and
southeastern regions, the focus of the conflict is in the Kurdistan
Region of Iraq, where Turkey conducts regular cross-border operations
and airstrikes against PKK targets, in some cases killing and injuring
civilians.]{.underline}

[The Erdoğan government refuses to distinguish between the PKK and the
democratically elected Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP)]{.underline}
which won 11.7 percent of the national vote in the 2018 parliamentary
elections and 65 local municipalities in the 2019 local elections.
Former party co-chairs Selahattin Demirtaş and Figen Yüksekdağ have been
in detention since November 2016. Turkey has refused to comply with a
2020 European Court of Human Rights ruling that Demirtaş should be
immediately released.

Since August 2019, the Interior Ministry has justified the removal of 48
elected Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) mayors on the basis that they
face criminal investigations and prosecutions for links with the PKK.
Repeating the approach taken in 2016-17, the government has replaced
mayors in the southeast with Ankara-appointed provincial governors and
deputy governor "trustees."

At time of writing, 19 mayors remain in pretrial detention. In March, a
Diyarbakır court sentenced Adnan Selçuk Mızraklı, the dismissed mayor of
Diyarbakır Metropolitan Municipality, to over nine years in prison based
on a witness statement accusing him of links with the PKK. The case is
under appeal. In October, an Ankara court ruled for the pretrial
detention of Kars mayor, Ayhan Bilgen, and 16 other HDP officials, in
connection with an investigation into their alleged role in 2014
protests.

In June, the Turkish parliament revoked the parliamentary seats of two
HDP deputies, Leyla Güven and Musa Farisoğulları, on the grounds that
the Court of Cassation had upheld convictions against them for
membership in a terrorist organization, and Enis Berberoğlu, a deputy
from the main opposition Republican People's Party, for revealing state
secrets by sharing video footage of trucks of weapons being transferred
to Syria with Cumhuriyet newspaper.

In June, an Istanbul appeal court upheld the conviction of Canan
Kaftancıoğlu, Istanbul chair of People's Republican Party (CHP), to
nearly 10 years in prison for tweets she made years ago. A further
appeal is underway.

Refugees and Migrants

Turkey continues to host the world's largest number of refugees, around
3.6 million from Syria, and over 400,000 refugees and migrants from
Afghanistan, Iraq, and other countries. On February 27, 2020, Turkey
announced that authorities would not intercept asylum seekers wishing to
leave Turkey through its borders with the European Union.

As a result, thousands of migrants and asylum seekers gathered at the
Turkish-Greek border. Many of those that managed to cross the Evros
River into Greece were summarily and violently pushed back by Greek
security forces. The onset of the Covid-19 pandemic prompted Turkey to
close the border again, but attempted crossings by migrants of land and
sea borders and pushbacks from Greece continued.

At least 60 Afghans and others died after entering Turkey from Iran and
crossing Lake Van in the eastern part of the country in a fishing boat.
The border with Syria has been closed to new asylum seekers since 2016;
Turkish border guards have killed or injured some of those attempting to
cross and carried out mass summary pushbacks.

with further backsliding in many areas."]{.underline} The EU made a
number of statements on negative developments, criticizing in February
the re-arrest of Osman Kavala, and in July, the conviction of rights
defenders including Taner Kılıç.

[Turkish-US relations remain strained for multiple reasons, including
the presence on US soil of Fethullah Gülen, US support for Kurdish-led
forces in Syria, Turkey's acquisition of Russian S-400 missiles, and the
forthcoming New York trial of a state-owned Turkish bank for Iran
sanctions-busting and money laundering]{.underline}.

In June and October, Istanbul courts convicted two local employees of
the US consulate in Istanbul on terrorism charges, imposing prison
sentences ranging from five to nearly nine years because the employees
had prior professional contact, years earlier, with police officers
later accused of being Gülenists.

In a February report, the [Council of Europe Commissioner for Human

Attacks on Rule of Law

In March, [the government declared a state of emergency]{.underline} in
response to the pandemic and the parliament, where the ruling party has
a two-thirds majority, [passed an Authorization Act giving the
government unlimited power to rule by decree indefinitely]{.underline}
and without parliamentary oversight. The law also included a new
criminal offense for the publication of "fake" or "distorted facts"
pertaining to the pandemic.

[The government]{.underline} adopted hundreds of decrees before the
Authorization Act and state of emergency were revoked in mid-June,
including several unrelated to public health, such as decrees that
[stripped funds to municipalities, disproportionally affecting
localities ruled by opposition parties]{.underline}. The ruling Fidesz
party had suffered a major blow in the October 2019 local elections when
the party lost 10 larger cities to the opposition, including the capital
city, Budapest.

While the Authorization Act was revoked in mid-June[, Parliament
simultaneously adopted a new law enabling the government to declare
future public health or medical emergencies]{.underline} during which
**[it could order any and all measures it deems necessary without
parliamentary approval, including suspending laws and curtailing
fundamental rights such as freedom of movement and
assembly]{.underline}** for six months. These powers are renewable every
six months with minimal or no parliamentary or judicial oversight.

Freedom of Media

**[The government continued its attacks on media and freedom of
expression]{.underline}**. Most [media outlets are directly or
indirectly controlled by the government, which has a chilling effect on
independent journalism]{.underline}. Between March and June, daily
online government coronavirus task force press briefings required media
outlets to submit questions by email, with the government in most cases
ignoring questions posed by critical outlets and journalists.

[In March, the government amended the criminal code to make it a crime
to spread "fake news" or engage in "fear mongering" during a pandemic
punishable by up to five years' imprisonment]{.underline}. At the time,
Harlem Desir, then media freedom representative for the Organization for
Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), called on the government to
ensure that the Authorization Act should not impede the work of media in
Hungary. By July, police had launched 134 criminal investigations
concerning "fear mongering." [A majority of cases concern people who
expressed critical comments on social media regarding the government's
handling of the pandemic.]{.underline} At time of writing,
investigations were ongoing.

In July, Szabolcs Dull, the editor-in-chief of the largest online
independent daily, Index, was fired as a result of a financial takeover
of the company controlling Index's revenue streams. The new owner has
close links to Prime Minister Viktor Orban and his government. Index's
entire staff resigned in protest. In September, the Media Council, a
regulatory body the members of which are appointed by the ruling party,
revoked the frequency for Klubradio, an independent radio station in
Budapest, entering into effect in February 2021. The Media Council
justified its actions referring to Klubradio's repeated breaches of the
media law. Klubradio denied the allegations.

[Academic Freedom]{.underline}

In October, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) ruled that
a 2017 law that effectively forced the George Soros funded Central
European University to leave Budapest and relocate in Vienna, violated
European Union law.

Nonetheless, **[the government's efforts to control academic
institutions continued.]{.underline}** A law adopted in June, which
entered into effect in September, effectively abolished the autonomy of
the University of Theatre and Film in Budapest, depriving its highest
governing body of decision-making power over budgetary, organizational,
and staffing issues. [The Ministry of Technology and Innovation

the supervisory body---all closely linked to the government and with
limited to no knowledge of the arts.]{.underline}

Gender, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity

**[The government continued to undermine women's and LGBT
rights]{.underline}**. In May, the [parliament blocked the ratification
of the Council of Europe Convention on Combating Violence Against Women
and Domestic Violence, known as the Istanbul Convention, saying it
"promotes destructive gender ideologies" and "illegal
migration."]{.underline}

Hungary signed the convention, which mandates government measures to
prevent domestic and gender-based violence, protect survivors, and
prosecute perpetrators, in 2014. Also, in May, [a new law made it
impossible for transgender or intersex people to legally change their
gender---putting them at risk of harassment, discrimination, and even
violence]{.underline} in daily situations when they need to use identity
documents. Council of Europe Human Rights Commissioner Dunja Mijatovic,
called the law "a blow to the human dignity of trans people" and said it
contradicted the case law of the European Court of Human Rights.

Migration and Asylum

The country saw a significant decline in asylum applications in 2020 due
to border closures and other restrictions. By July, 95 people had filed
for asylum, down from 266 people in the first 7 months of 2019;
authorities granted some form of international protection to 113 people.
Pushbacks from Hungary to Serbia, sometimes violent, continued.

Following a May ruling from the CJEU that automatic and indefinite
placement of asylum seekers in transit zones on the Hungary-Serbia
border amounted to unlawful detention, the government dismantled the
transit zones and transferred approximately 400 asylum seekers to the
only two open reception centers in Hungary. Authorities had already
suspended asylum seekers' access to the zones in March, using the
pandemic as a pretext.

In June, [the government rammed through a law abolishing the right to
seek asylum on Hungarian territory and requiring asylum claims be lodged
at specifically designated embassies in non-EU countries.]{.underline}
If granted access to the territory, the asylum seeker, including
children, will be placed in automatic detention for 30 days with no
possibility to appeal their detention. According to the Hungarian
Helsinki Committee, as of late July, only seven people---all members of
the same family---had applied under the new restrictive system; their
application was rejected.

In October, the EU Commission initiated legal action against Hungary on
grounds that the new procedures breach EU asylum law.

As of September, the government re-introduced further border closures in
response to rising Covid-19 infections, barring entry to most
non-Hungarian citizens. Exceptions made for citizens from Czech
Republic, Slovakia, and Poland were criticized by the European
Commission as discriminatory and contravening the principle of free
movement within the EU.

Discrimination

**[Roma continue to be discriminated in workplaces and schools and many
live in abject poverty.]{.underline}** In January, following a lower
court decision ordering €275,000 (US\$327,112) in damages to 60 Roma
students who had been unlawfully segregated in primary school, Prime
[Minister Orban said the ruling was an affront to people's sense of
justice when "members of an ethnically dominant ethnic group can receive
a significant amount of money without doing any kind of
work."]{.underline} In May, the Supreme Court upheld the lower court's
decision.

Human Rights Defenders

[The government and ruling party members continued their smear campaign
against human rights defenders, frequently describing them as "Soros
agents" or "national security risks"]{.underline} in government-friendly
media.

In June, the CJEU ruled that a 2017 law requiring civil society
organization receiving over €20,000 (\$23,790) from outside of Hungary
to formally register as foreign-funded, was contrary to EU law. At time
of writing, the government had taken no action to implement the CJEU
ruling and revoke the law.

Civil society organizations and lawyers continued to work on behalf of
migrants and refugee rights despite a controversial 2017 law
criminalizing aid and assistance to asylum seekers, refugees and
migrants. At time of writing, nobody had been charged under the law.

I disagree. At a stretch, t[errorists taking advantage of advances in
biology might be able to create a viable pathogen. That does not mean
they could create a sophisticated biological weapon, and certainly not a
weapon that could kill 30 million people. Terrorists in any event tend
to be conservative. They use readily available weapons that have a
proven track record---not unconventional weapons that are more difficult
to develop and deploy.]{.underline} Available evidence shows that few
terrorists have ever even contemplated using biological agents, and the
extremely small number of bioterrorism incidents in the historical
record shows that [biological agents are difficult to use as weapons.
The skills required to undertake even the most basic of bioterrorism
attacks are more demanding than often assumed.]{.underline} These
technical barriers are likely to persist in the near- and medium-term
future.

Gates does a disservice to the global health security community when he
draws media and policy attention to amateurs such as terrorists. [Where
biological weapons are concerned, the focus should remain on national
militaries and state-sponsored groups]{.underline}. These are the
entities that might have the capability, now or in the near future, to
develop dangerous biological weapons. [The real threat is that
sophisticated biological weapons will be used by state actors---or by
financially, scientifically, and militarily well-resourced groups
sponsored by states.]{.underline}

[In most cases terrorist groups appear to have largely opted for the
simplest pathway towards the achievement of their goals and]{.underline}
[the weapons used tend to be vernacular, functional devices drawing on
local and readily-available materials, rather than sophisticated,
"baroque" technologies]{.underline}. This is certainly the case with
IEDs, the history of which is characterised largely by incremental
innovations -- although nevertheless frequently effective ones -- with
many means of delivery recycled from the past.44 Complexity can
therefore be seen as important in the adoption of technology by
terrorists generally, but is perhaps particularly acute in the case of
CBW technology. Some CBW can be relatively simple: "chlorine-augmented,
vehicle-borne IEDs," as employed by Al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) from 2006 to
2007 are not sophisticated weapons.45 Attacks on chemical production
facilities, an apparent tactic of Serbian forces in the early to
mid-1990s,46 employed relatively simple technologies -- specifically
explosives -- with toxicity a secondary by-product. Direct contamination
of food,47 drink48 or healthcare products49 does not require
particularly sophisticated technology for the purposes of delivery --
although may require some considerable skill to culture and scale-up a
biological agent -- and has been a common approach in European CBW
incidents.50 Similarly, the contamination of water systems, something
familiar to Europe,51 can also be relatively easily attempted. However,
in most cases such methods of dissemination have generated results that
are far short of the "mass destruction" that CBW are associated with,
although this does not mean such a possibility can be ignored by those
working on public health preparedness. [Although some relatively simple
approaches could cause significant harm, mass casualty attacks still
require considerable expertise, something particularly acute in the
context of biological weapons]{.underline}.52 The most effective route
to weaponising biology is arguably through the process of aerosolising
agents, something recognised mid-way through the last century as opening
up the theoretical possibility of using biological weapons on a gigantic
scale.53 However, [realising such theoretical potential is difficult and
it took states decades to develop more predictable biological
weapon]{.underline}s,54 [and even then such weapons were acutely
vulnerable to environmental factors]{.underline}. 55 [For non-state
groups such complexity has proven a significant barrier to CBW
development]{.underline}. By means of an example, one of the
best-resourced biological weapons programs, that of Aum Shinrikyo,
failed variously because the group acquired the wrong strain,
contaminated fermenters and were faced with insurmountable production
and dissemination difficulties.56 There are of course exceptions, such
as the 2001 anthrax Letter Attacks in the US. However, if one accepts
the conclusions of the FBI that this sophisticated attack with
aerosolised anthrax in the US postal system was perpetrated by a US
biodefence researcher, Dr Bruce Ivins,57 it is an exception that proves
the rule.

[In the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, the U.S. government is
revisiting its oversight of experiments that involve modifying pathogens
in ways that might make them more harmful to people.]{.underline}
Yesterday, White House officials and the National Institutes of Health
(NIH) asked an expert advisory board to undertake a swift, [broad review
of the agency's policies that aim to make sure federally funded studies
of viruses and other microbes that could cause a pandemic are undertaken
safely, and to bar funding for experiments deemed too
risky.]{.underline}

The review---to be conducted over 10 months by the National Science
Advisory Board for Biosecurity (NSABB)---could include consideration of
whether controversial coronavirus experiments funded by the United
States in China should have received stricter scrutiny. The panel might
also explore whether the United States should fund any such pathogen
research conducted abroad, where NIH may have less ability to enforce
its rules.

Researchers who say federal oversight of potentially risky research is
too lax are welcoming the review. But some NSABB members and outside
scientists worry it could result in recommendations that limit U.S.
support for research essential to fighting SARS-CoV-2 and future
pandemics.

[The goal of the biosecurity policy review is to examine some
"challenging questions, including ... whether there are some experiments
that should not be done because of the risks they pose,"]{.underline}
said Daniel Gastfriend, director for biodefense and pandemic
preparedness at the White House's National Security Council, during the
online NSABB meeting yesterday.

[Some researchers have long worried that pathogens being studied in labs
could accidentally escape, or even be deliberately
released.]{.underline} They have become particularly concerned about
certain gain-of-function (GOF) experiments in which researchers give
pathogens new capabilities, such as the ability to spread among mammals,
in order to better understand their biology.

[In response to such concerns, the U.S. government over the past decade
has developed several regulatory systems that impose stricter oversight
on research involving especially problematic human and animal pathogens.
One set of rules, for example, requires NIH to impose special
requirements on studies that involve what NIH defines as enhanced
potential pandemic pathogens (ePPPs).]{.underline}

Such projects demonstrate the need to first develop safer versions of
this powerful technology and raise important issues related to standards
and regulation. [The consequences of using such technologies are not
contained within national borders, and these effects will likely require
some form of transnational mechanism that considers the views of all
stakeholders.]{.underline} This calls for a more harmonized approach to
biotech policy, especially since rules and practices of gene editing
vary significantly from country to country. [Meanwhile, all
stakeholders, including those funding and supporting research, need to
ensure adherence to existing guidance]{.underline} such as the World
Health Organization's (WHO) 2014 set of guidelines for testing
genetically modified mosquitoes.132 According to some experts, [this
push to shore up standards might require the establishment of some form
of accountability mechanism that can, at a minimum, oversee adherence to
this guidance and identify possible obstacles to
implementation]{.underline}.133

Another ecological risk is the potential for biological attacks against
food and water resources, which, as discussed further below, would cause
economic damage as well as a "loss of confidence in the food supply, and
possible loss of life."134 For example, a recent study determined that
scientists' deepening understanding of the genomes of plants and animals
will make it theoretically possible to target vulnerabilities with
greater precision or to create new varieties of organisms with
potentially harmful properties. The authors posit that "if plant or
animal pathogens \[a\]re engineered to spread widely in the world in
crops or herds, respectively, the result could be widespread and lasting
food shortages."135

Other health and safety risks: Incidents like laboratory accidents or
research aimed at rendering deadly viruses more contagious or pathogenic
pose dangers as well. Relatedly, the publication of such techniques and
research outcomes could educate and empower malevolent actors. Concerns
of this kind arose from research published by two scientists in 2012 in
prominent journals (Nature and Science). Both had succeeded in
genetically engineering strains of the avian flu virus (H5N1).136 The
controversial decision to publish their research findings stemmed from
intense public concerns that the virus could leak out of a laboratory in
the event of an accident. More seriously, the research could be
leveraged by terrorists to create a biological weapon and unleash a
devastating pandemic.

National guidance, regulations, and codes of conduct by the research
community are helping address some of these challenges.137 Globally, the
International Standards Organization is developing new standards to
harmonize attempts to help laboratories manage biological risk, drawing
from EU and WHO efforts to establish and implement effective biorisk
management systems.138 But there are still important gaps[. As
biotechnology becomes cheaper and more readily available, these softer
forms of regulation will likely be insufficient for managing the
associated risks.]{.underline}

#### Soft power fails

accessed 6-27-2022\]

The Russian invasion of Ukraine has already punctured much of the
prevailing foreign-policy thinking that had become pro forma in
Washington and Europe[. In particular, the notion that Western
unilateral disarmament can somehow be balanced or compensated for with
less tangible forms of influence---soft power---has much to answer for
in this ongoing crisis.]{.underline} [By now, it is clear that Moscow's
actions in Crimea strongly demonstrate the sharp limits of soft power,
especially one that appears to have been decoupled from hard
power,]{.underline} the traditional final arbiter of interstate
relations. [Ukraine is not merely a geopolitical setback, but a symptom
of a misplaced faith in the potency of postmodern soft power as foreign
policy plan A through Z.]{.underline}

Ukraine's rapid transformation from homo Sovieticus--ruled kleptocracy
to inspiring popular revolution to the latest victim of Russian
imperialism has been astonishing. In the span of mere weeks, Ukraine's
political cleavages have been magnified as the faultline of a tense
geopolitical contest between the Euro-Atlantic community and a
revanchist, increasingly militant Russia. In the Western scramble to
come to terms with the new threat landscape---let alone formulating an
effective, unified response---Crimea has almost certainly already been
lost. Meanwhile, Russia seems poised to expand its writ into other areas
of eastern Ukraine just as it aggressively probes Euro-Atlantic
readiness in the Baltic, Turkey, and the Caucasus. In Washington,
defense and administration officials appear resigned---if only
unofficially---to Russian control over Crimea (if not eastern Ukraine)
and are digging in for the long haul.

How did we get here? Among the ideologues, the answer lies in the
foreign policies of the current or previous administrations. On the
right, President Obama's "reset" and subordination of foreign policy to
domestic issues is the obvious cause. And on the left, President Bush's
wars have given the Kremlin the perfect moral justification. But the
reality, like many things, is hardly one sided. Partisans decrying
President Obama's "weakness" appear to ignore that the administration\'s
response to Russia's occupation of Crimea is already far more muscular
than President Bush's reaction to the Russian invasion of Georgia 2008.
And conversely, some of the left's bizarre use of a war they supposedly
opposed to equivocate on the invasion of a sovereign state by corrupt
autocracy is as self-contradictory as it is troubling.

The likelier culprit is not so intimately tethered to the tribalisms of
American politics, though ideology inevitably has played a role.
[Instead, the Western political class has become intoxicated with the
notion that soft power, now the highly fashionable foreign-policy
instrument of first resort, can compensate for---or in some ways replace
altogether---diminished hard power.]{.underline} If the late 1990s was
the heyday for liberal internationalism by airpower, the late 2000s saw
an analogous consensus congregate around soft power.

Soft power is supposed to describe the latent factors---values, economy,
culture and the like---of a state, entity or idea to persuade or
attract. This contrasts with its more recognizable counterpart, hard
power, which is based on the more traditional principle of coercion.
There is little doubt that soft power is a real and fundamentally
important phenomenon in the conduct of international relations.
Contributions from scholars like Joseph Nye and Giulio Gallarotti have
made a compelling case that soft power is a powerful geopolitical
signifier; but what began as a keen observation had morphed into a
cottage industry looking to leverage soft power into a foreign-policy
panacea.

In an illuminating 2011 paper published by the Strategic Studies
Institute at the U.S. Army War College, University of Reading (U.K.)
political scientist Colin S. Gray rightly acknowledges the merits of the
soft-power thesis while articulating its practical limitations,
particularly in the policy arena.

"While it is sensible to seek influence abroad as cost-effectively as
possible, it is only prudent to be modest in one\'s expectations of the
soft power to be secured by cultural influence," cautions Gray[. Indeed,
soft power's attraction and subsequent embrace by the foreign policy
elite had as much to do with its usefulness as a substitute for "hard
power" as its salience as an idea. But while hard and soft power can be
complementary, Gray observes that soft power can in no way compensate
for military power. "]{.underline}Sad to say," laments Gray, "there is
no convincing evidence suggesting an absence of demand for the threat
and use of military force." Sad, indeed.

[However, events in Ukraine have exposed the stark limits of soft power
in a way that no analysis ever could. There is no small irony in the
fact that Russia's forceful military intervention into Ukraine was
preceded by a grinding, if superficially velveted, tug of war between
Moscow and the West over Ukraine's integration with two competing
soft-power "vehicles"---th]{.underline}e EU and the Moscow-led Customs
Union-cum-Eurasian Union. It was Yanukovych's abandonment of Ukraine's
pledge to sign an Association Agreement with the EU---following intense
Russian coercion---that protests began again in earnest. Yanukovych's
turn to brutality eventually precipitated his toppling, Russia's
military intervention, and now Crimea's annexation.

[The idea of soft power as operational policy should be
buried.]{.underline} While there is some government role in propagating
and wielding soft power---public affairs, policy making, and, yes,
sometimes psychological operations---the real business of soft power is
exists well outside of the domain of the state. In reality, [the track
record of operationalizing soft power has been, to date, abysmal. Russia
is a case in point]{.underline}. Moscow repeatedly sought to revise the
post-Cold War order through a variety of projects that might normally be
filed as soft-power initiatives: then president Dmitry Medvedev's
repeated attempts to reorient the European security architecture; the
Kremlin obsession with making the ruble an international reserve
currency; the formation of the Russia-led Customs Union in 2010; and the
(now likely stillborn) plans to establish the Eurasian Union. And yet,
in the end, Crimea was forcibly seized by men with guns.

Indeed, the truer currency of power remains the ability to coerce.
Fatigue from disastrous wars in Iraq and Afghanistan elevated
expectations that soft power could supplant a beleaguered and
overstretched U.S. military. Why, indeed, would the U.S. opt for
coercion when civilizational persuasion could do the trick? Pro-West
people power in Eurasia seemed to bolster the case for operationalized
soft power after the "color revolutions" in Georgia, Ukraine and
Kyrgyzstan. Yet the longer-term results were unpredictable at best and
disastrous at worst. [Over time, it has become increasingly apparent
that soft power is perhaps less an instrument to wield than a favorable
wind at our backs.]{.underline}

[The crisis with Russia has laid bare the limits of soft power as well
as the continued relevance of hard power---even in "postmodern"
Europe]{.underline}. While the Obama administration should be credited
with being among the few Western governments to offer a relatively
serious response to the Ukraine crisis, the White House overall still
seems uncomfortable with the difficult but very real role that hard
power necessarily plays in establishing and policing a U.S.-led, liberal
normative order. This must change with the new circumstances established
by Russian revanchism. [Western values can only be propagated and upheld
with the ultimate guarantee of hard power. And if the West is not
prepared to enforce its values with tangible consequences, then perhaps
we should abandon the pretense of a rules-based international system and
cease the cruel practice of giving hope where there is none to be
had.]{.underline}

[Soft power is here to stay, but its moment as a diplomatic instrument
has long since gone. Because, in reality, it was never really much more
than an illusion of what we wished the world to be rather than the one
that exists.]{.underline}

[An international team of scientists says that we cannot rely on
technology to meet climate targets -- instead, wealthy countries must
change their lifestyles to dramatically reduce emissions and avoid
climate breakdown.]{.underline}

The new article, published in Nature Energy, calls for [the urgent
development of new climate models that explore ways economies can remain
stable without constantly growing, reducing the reliance on potentially
unfeasible new technologies to fix our problems.]{.underline}

"We cannot keep temperature rises below 1.5 degrees using technology
alone -- unfortunately this will require lifestyle changes in wealthy
countries," says Manfred Lenzen from the University of Sydney, co-author
of the study.

"Because we've not implemented significant emissions reductions over the
past decades when we should have, we now need to reduce emissions
rapidly and like we've never done before."

Models attempt to predict future temperatures and climate based on
current data and simulations; they can follow a variety of pathways to
different outcomes based on our choices now.

Many of these current models accept that economies will continue to
strive for growth, and factor in dramatic technological change in order
to meet climate targets such as the Paris Agreement.

The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, for example,
argues that innovative technology is essential for not only cutting
greenhouse gas emissions but also adapting to the impacts of climate
change.

[But this new study argues that technological fixes -- such as carbon
capture and storage, nuclear fusion, or injecting particulates into the
atmosphere -- may be unfeasible to scale up to the required levels,
especially as increased economic growth drives up energy
demand.]{.underline}

The authors point out that [to remove carbon from the atmosphere at a
fast enough rate, direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS) methods
may use up to half of the world's current electricity generation. This
would then make it difficult to make the global transition to
renewables.]{.underline}

"[Scientists have raised substantial questions about the risks of
negative emissions technologies and the feasibility of sufficiently
decoupling economic growth from rising emissions]{.underline}," says
Jason Hickel, lead author of the paper from the London School of
Economics and Political Science (LSE).

["Put bluntly, these approaches may not be adequate to address the
crisis we face. We're gambling the future of humanity and the rest of
life on Earth because of the assumption that GDP must continue to grow
in rich countries."]{.underline}

This echoes previous research arguing that [over-reliance on new
technology is enabling us to delay a dramatic reduction in emissions,
creating a dangerous cycle of technological promises and re-framed
climate change targets.]{.underline}

Instead, scientists call for widespread cultural, social and political
transformation.

"It doesn't have to be this way," Hickel and colleagues write.
"High-income nations can maintain economic stability, invest in
innovation and achieve strong social outcomes without the need for
additional growth, thereby making mitigation easier to achieve."

[They instead propose policies that will reduce inequality, guarantee
living wages, shorten the working week, and ensure access to healthcare,
education and other essential services.]{.underline}

["If we share the yields of our economy more fairly, we can ensure good
lives for all without plundering the planet for more," Hickel
says.]{.underline}

[By updating existing climate models to address alternative
'post-growth' scenarios, the authors conclude, this would "help broaden
the range of policy options for public debate".]{.underline}

Researchers Duncan McLaren and Nils Markusson from Lancaster Environment
Centre say that: \"[For forty years, climate action has been delayed by
technological promises. Contemporary promises are equally dangerous. Our
work exposes how such promises have raised expectations of more
effective policy options becoming available in the future, and thereby
enabled a continued politics of prevarication and inadequate
action.]{.underline}

\"Prevarication is not necessarily intentional, but such promises can
feed systemic \'moral corruption\', in which current elites are enabled
to pursue self-serving pathways, while passing off risk onto vulnerable
people in the future and in the global South.

The article describes a history of such promises, showing how the
overarching international goal of \'avoiding dangerous climate change\'
has been reinterpreted and differently represented in the light of new
modelling methods, scenarios and technological promises.

The researchers argue that the targets, models and technologies have
co-evolved in ways that enable delay: \"Each novel promise not only
competes with existing ideas, but also downplays any sense of urgency,
enabling the repeated deferral of political deadlines for climate action
and undermining societal commitment to meaningful responses.

[They conclude: \"Putting our hopes in yet more new technologies is
unwise. Instead, cultural, social and political transformation is
essential to enable widespread deployment of both behavioural and
technological responses to climate change.\"]{.underline}

### \--xt past tipping points

#### We've already passed the climate tipping point

**Carrington 22** (Damian Carrington, "Extreme heat in oceans 'passed
point of no return' in 2014, The Guardian, February 1 2022,
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/01/extreme-heat-oceans-passed-point-of-no-return-high-temperatures-wildlife-seas>,
WC-NAS)

[Extreme heat in the world's oceans passed the "point of no return" in
2014 and has become the new normal, according to research.]{.underline}

Scientists analysed sea surface temperatures over the last 150 years,
which have risen because of global heating. They found that extreme
temperatures occurring just 2% of the time a century ago have occurred
at least 50% of the time across the global ocean since 2014.

In some hotspots, extreme temperatures occur 90% of the time, severely
affecting wildlife. More than 90% of the heat trapped by greenhouse
gases is absorbed by the ocean, which plays a critical role in
maintaining a stable climate.

"By using this measure of extremes, we've shown that climate change is
not something that is uncertain and may happen in the distant future --
it's something that is a historical fact and has occurred already," said
Kyle Van Houtan, at the Monterey Bay Aquarium, US, and one of the
research team. "Extreme climate change is here, it's in the ocean, and
the ocean underpins all life on Earth."

Van Houtan and his colleague Kisei Tanaka are ecologists and began the
study because they wanted to assess how heat extremes were related to
the loss of kelp forests off the coast of California.

"Ecology teaches us that extremes have an outsized impact on
ecosystems," Van Houtan said. "We are trying to understand the dramatic
changes that we've seen along our coasts and in the ocean, on coral
reefs, kelp, white sharks, sea otters, fish, and more."

Other scientists reported in 2019 that the [number of heatwaves
affecting the planet's oceans had increased
sharply](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/mar/04/heatwaves-sweeping-oceans-like-wildfires-scientists-reveal),
killing swathes of sea life like "wildfires that take out huge areas of
forest".

Van Houtan and Tanaka found no measure of extreme heat existed and so
extended their work globally. The study, [published in the Plos
Climate](https://journals.plos.org/climate/article?id=10.1371/journal.pclm.0000007) journal,
examined the monthly temperature in each one-degree-by-one-degree part
of the ocean and set the highest temperature in the 50-year period as
the benchmark for extreme heat.

The scientists then examined temperature records from 1920 to 2019, the
most recent year available. They found that by 2014, more than 50% of
the monthly records across the entire ocean had surpassed the
once-in-50--years extreme heat benchmark. The researchers called the
year when the percentage passed 50% and did not fall back below it in
subsequent years the "point of no return".

By 2019, the proportion of the global ocean suffering extreme heat was
57%. "We expect this to keep on going up," said Van Houtan. But the
extreme heat was particularly severe in some parts of the ocean, with
the South Atlantic having passed the point of no return in 1998. "That
was 24 years ago -- that is astounding," he said.

The proportion of the ocean experiencing extreme heat in some large
ecosystems is now 80%-90%, with the five worst affected including areas
off the north-east coasts of the US and Canada, off Somalia and
Indonesia, and in the Norwegian Sea.

"You should care about turtles, seabirds and whales, but even if you
don't, the two most lucrative fisheries in the US, lobster and scallops,
are in those exact spots," said Van Houtan, while 14 fisheries in Alaska
have recently been [declared federal
disasters](https://www.ktoo.org/2022/01/25/federal-disasters-declared-for-14-alaska-fisheries/#:~:text=The%20disaster%20declarations%20include%20the,in%20the%20summer%20of%202021.).

The heat content of the top 2,000 metres of the [ocean set a new record
in
2021](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/11/oceans-hottest-temperatures-research-climate-crisis),
the sixth in a row. Prof John Abraham at the University of St Thomas in
Minnesota, one of the team behind the assessment, said ocean heat
content was the most relevant to global climate, while surface
temperatures were most relevant to weather patterns, as well as many
ecosystems.

"Oceans are critical to understanding climate change. They cover about
70% of the planet's surface and absorb more than 90% of global warming
heat," Abraham said. "The new study is helpful because the researchers
look at the surface temperatures. It finds there has been a big increase
in extreme heat at the ocean's surface and that the extremes are
increasing over time."

### \--xt Carbon neutrality fails

#### Carbon neutrality isn't enough

Many people believe that if we all just drove electric cars, used LED
lightbulbs, and even did things like sail across the ocean rather than
fly, the resulting reduction in pollution could somehow stop global
warming. Unfortunately, it isn't true. Yes, the world has to radically
reduce emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other global warming
gasses. [But to avoid planetary catastrophe, we also must remove a vast
amount of CO2 that's already in our atmosphere.]{.underline}

The United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)
says average global temperatures cannot be allowed to exceed, at the
very most, 2 degrees centigrade above the average that prevailed before
industrialization. If possible, the increase shouldn't exceed 1.5
degrees. Otherwise, we face even more violent weather, damaging
wildfires, rising sea levels, water scarcity, an unstable food supply,
and who knows what other horrors. And here is a key but little-discussed
passage from an important 2018 IPCC report: "All pathways that limit
global warming to 1.5°C with limited or no overshoot project the use of
carbon dioxide removal (CDR)." Note the word--"all."

"[We've got to keep temperature rise to 1.5 degrees, and that can't be
done without carbon removal,"]{.underline} summarizes James Mulligan,
who works fulltime on this issue at the World Resources Institute (WRI),
a large global non-profit focused on natural resource sustainability.
Adds Leslie Jones, a vice president and climate expert at the
Environmental Defense Fund (EDF): "[The National Academy of Sciences has
concluded that if we're going to have a fighting chance to limit warming
to 1.5 or even 2 degrees, we'll have to do two things--aggressively
slash greenhouse gas emissions and deploy carbon removal,]{.underline}
both natural approaches and emerging technologies."

Containing emissions will be all the more challenging given the world's
other needs. [The United Nations' 17 Sustainable Development Goals for
2030 articulate many things we must achieve for a fairer, healthier
world. Goal number 13 is "Climate Action." But other goals demand
economic inclusion and societal health. Those can't be achieved without
ongoing economic growth, particularly in developing countries that were
excluded from the industrial world's 20th century accumulation of
wealth. The legitimate demands of previously excluded people will thus
place more pressure on global atmospheric CO2.]{.underline}

[Warming gasses are still getting worse in the atmosphere, but it won't
be enough to make them stop, go down, or even disappear. We literally
have to suck them up. Neutral is not enough. To meet the 1.5 degree
target, says the EDF's Jones, "We need to reach net zero greenhouse gas
emissions by 2050, and keep that trend line going down to net
negative."]{.underline} Already 60 nations have committed themselves to
"net zero" emissions, including Britain, France, and Germany.
Eliminating all CO2 emissions will almost certainly be impossible.
(There's little near-term likelihood of electric airliners, for
example.) So we'll need rapid progress in CDR just to get to "net zero,"
and far more to go "net negative." [Here's the bottom line: carbon
removal at large scale is indispensable for maintaining a livable
earth.]{.underline}

[A global treaty bans development or stockpiling of biological weapons
--- but allows biodefense planning.]{.underline}

[Scientists are making dramatic progress]{.underline} with techniques
for "gene splicing" -- modifying the genetic makeup of organisms.

[This work includes bioengineering pathogens for medical research,
techniques that also can be used to create deadly biological
weapons]{.underline}. It's an overlap that's helped fuel speculation
that the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus was bioengineered at China's Wuhan
Institute of Virology and that it subsequently "escaped" through a lab
accident to produce the COVID-19 pandemic.

[The world already has a legal foundation to prevent gene splicing for
warfare: the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention.]{.underline}
Unfortunately, [nations have been unable to agree on how to strengthen
the treaty.]{.underline} **[Some countries have also pursued bioweapons
research and stockpiling in violation of it.]{.underline}**

As a member of President Bill Clinton's National Security Council from
1996 to 2001, I had a firsthand view of the failure to strengthen the
convention. From 2009 to 2013, as President Barack Obama's White House
coordinator for weapons of mass destruction, I led a team that grappled
with the challenges of regulating potentially dangerous biological
research in the absence of strong international rules and regulations.

**[The history of the Biological Weapons Convention reveals the limits
of international attempts to control research and development of
biological agents.]{.underline}**

[1960s-1970s: International negotiations to outlaw
biowarfare]{.underline}

The United Kingdom first proposed a global biological weapons ban in
1968.

Reasoning that bioweapons had no useful military or strategic purpose
given the awesome power of nuclear weapons, the U.K. had ended its
offensive bioweapons program in 1956. But the risk remained that other
countries might consider developing bioweapons as a poor man's atomic
bomb.

In the original British proposal, countries would have to identify
facilities and activities with potential bioweapons applications. They
would also need to accept on-site inspections by an international agency
to verify these facilities were being used for peaceful purposes.

These negotiations gained steam in 1969 when the Nixon administration
ended America's offensive biological weapons program and supported the
British proposal. In 1971, the Soviet Union announced its support -- but
only with the verification provisions stripped out. Since it was
essential to get the USSR on board, the U.S. and U.K. agreed to drop
those requirements.

In 1972 the treaty was finalized. After gaining the required signatures,
it took effect in 1975.

[Under the convention, 183 nations have **agreed not to "develop,
produce, stockpile or otherwise acquire or retain" biological materials
that could be used as weapons**. They also **agreed not to stockpile or
develop any "means of delivery" for using them**. The treaty allows
"prophylactic, protective or other peaceful" research and development --
**including medical research.**]{.underline}

However, the treaty lacks any mechanism to verify that countries are
complying with these obligations.

[1990s: Revelations of treaty violations]{.underline}

[This absence of verification was exposed as the convention's
fundamental flaw two decades later, when it turned out that the Soviets
had a great deal to hide.]{.underline}

In 1992, Russian President [Boris Yeltsin revealed the Soviet Union's
massive biological weapons program. Some of the program's reported
experiments involved making viruses and bacteria more lethal and
resistant to treatment. The Soviets also weaponized and mass-produced a
number of dangerous naturally occurring viruses]{.underline}, including
the anthrax and smallpox viruses, as well as the plague-causing Yersinia
pestis bacterium.

Yeltsin in 1992 ordered the program's end and the destruction of all its
materials. But doubts remain whether this was fully carried out.

[Another treaty violation came to light after the U.S. defeat of Iraq in
the 1991 Gulf War. United Nations inspectors discovered an Iraqi
bioweapons stockpile]{.underline}, including 1,560 gallons (6,000
liters) of anthrax spores and 3,120 gallons (12,000 liters) of botulinum
toxin. Both had been loaded into aerial bombs, rockets and missile
warheads, although Iraq never used these weapons.

[In the mid-1990s, during South Africa's transition to majority rule,
evidence emerged of the former apartheid regime's chemical and
biological weapons program.]{.underline} As revealed by the South
African Truth and Reconciliation Commission, the program focused on
assassination. [Techniques included infecting cigarettes and chocolates
with anthrax spores, sugar with salmonella and chocolates with botulinum
toxin.]{.underline}

[In response to these revelations, as well as suspicions that North
Korea, Iran, Libya and Syria were also violating the treaty, the U.S.
began urging other nations to close the verification gap. But despite 24
meetings over seven years, a specially formed group of international
negotiators failed to reach agreement on how to do it. The **problems
were both practical and political.**]{.underline}

**[Monitoring biological agents]{.underline}**

Several [factors make verification of the bioweapons treaty
difficult.]{.underline}

First, [the types of facilities that research and produce biological
agents, such as vaccines, antibiotics, vitamins, biological pesticides
and certain foods, can also produce biological weapons]{.underline}.
Some pathogens with legitimate medical and industrial uses can also be
used for bioweapons.

Further, [large quantities of certain biological weapons can be produced
quickly, by few personnel and in relatively small facilities. Hence,
biological weapons programs are more difficult for international
inspectors to detect than nuclear or chemical programs, which typically
require large facilities, numerous personnel and years of
operation]{.underline}.

[So an effective bioweapons verification process would require nations
to identify a large number of civilian facilities. Inspectors would need
to monitor them regularly. The monitoring would need to be intrusive,
allowing inspectors to demand "challenge inspections," meaning access on
short notice to both known and suspected facilities.]{.underline}

Finally[, developing bioweapons defenses -- as permitted under the
treaty -- typically requires working with dangerous pathogens and
toxins, and even delivery systems. So distinguishing legitimate
biodefense programs from illegal bioweapons activities often comes down
to intent -- and intent is hard to verify.]{.underline}

Because of these inherent difficulties, verification faced stiff
opposition.

**[Political opposition to bioweapons verification]{.underline}**

As the White House official responsible for coordinating the U.S.
negotiating position, I often heard concerns and objections from
important government agencies.

[The Pentagon expressed fears that inspections of biodefense
installations would compromise national security or lead to false
accusations of treaty violations]{.underline}. The Commerce Department
opposed intrusive international inspections on behalf of the
pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. Such inspections might
compromise trade secrets, officials contended, or interfere with medical
research or industrial production.

[Germany and Japan, which also have large pharmaceutical and
biotechnology industries, raised similar objections]{.underline}.
**[China, Pakistan, Russia and others opposed nearly all on-site
inspections.]{.underline}** Since the rules under which the negotiation
group operated required consensus, any single country could block
agreement.

In January 1998, seeking to break the deadlock, the Clinton
administration proposed reduced verification requirements. Nations could
limit their declarations to facilities "especially suitable" for
bioweapons uses, such as vaccine production facilities. Random or
routine inspections of these facilities would instead be "voluntary"
visits or limited challenge inspections -- but only if approved by the
executive council of a to-be-created international agency monitoring the
bioweapons treaty.

But even this failed to achieve consensus among the international
negotiators.

Finally, in July 2001, the George W. Bush administration rejected the
Clinton proposal -- ironically, on the grounds that it was not strong
enough to detect cheating. With that, the negotiations collapsed.

Since then, nations have made no serious effort to establish a
verification system for the Biological Weapons Convention.

Even with the amazing advances scientists have made in genetic
engineering since the 1970s, there are few signs that countries are
interested in taking up the problem again.

**[This is especially true in today's climate of accusations against
China, and China's refusal to fully cooperate to determine the origins
of the COVID-19 pandemic.]{.underline}**
