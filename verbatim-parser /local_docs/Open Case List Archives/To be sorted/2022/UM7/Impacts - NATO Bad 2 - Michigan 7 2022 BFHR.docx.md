CAK: [Treaty commitments are **sacrosanct**]{.underline}. One of the
[pillars of]{.underline} a [rules-based system is for nations to live
by]{.underline} their [commitments]{.underline}. [They do not
**cherry-pick**]{.underline}. They don't only show up on a sunny day and
[disappear on a rainy day]{.underline}. The [US should stand
by]{.underline} its [**A**rticle **5**]{.underline} commitments if the
Russians test those commitments whether it concerns Estonia, Latvia,
Poland, or any other member. We should lead a coalition to defend the
territory of alliance members. [If the US were to fail to uphold its
**NATO commitments**]{.underline}, [it]{.underline} would [raise doubts
about US **commitments** globally]{.underline} --- [in
Asia]{.underline}, [the Middle East]{.underline},
[everywhere]{.underline}.

**Only [ironclad]{.underline} commitment maintains the alliance.**

Instead, we must continue to strengthen collective defense beyond the
Warsaw Summit. Russia's long-term strategy is to [erode NATO's
**security guarantee**]{.underline}. If successful, this [would have
**disastrous effects** for the entire Alliance]{.underline} and the
global security situation, not just the Baltic States. The [survival of
NATO]{.underline} therefore [depends on the credibility and the
**unconditional nature** of **A**rticle **5**]{.underline}. That
strength enables NATO to remain open for dialogue with Russia, despite
Moscow's provocations.

It isn't only the European Allies that need NATO. As a senior group of
former U.S. cabinet officers, officials and military officers pointed
out recently, NATO is America's greatest strategic advantage over
countries like Russia that have none, and the Allies help the American
people to shoulder the military and financial burden as they seek to
maintain peace.

NATO consists of like-minded countries that are glued together by shared
values and the most integrated political and military structure ever
seen in any alliance. Europe remains America's natural ally in solving
crises around the world. It is worth reminding ourselves that NATO is
not simply a marriage of convenience, and this is a rarity in
international politics.

[For NATO to remain]{.underline} the [strongest and **most successful**
alliance in history]{.underline}, the [security of any Ally should never
be seen]{.underline} simply [as a question of]{.underline} the
[fate]{.underline} of that country [but]{.underline} as a question of
[upholding an international order where]{.underline} the [rights of
nations cannot]{.underline} simply [be **subjugated by
force**]{.underline}. Only a strong and unified NATO can achieve that,
and [NATO is only **strong** and **unified** if each and
every]{.underline} Ally's [commitment to collective defense is
**ironclad**]{.underline}.

**[Legal]{.underline} guarantees are key.**

Nonetheless, strictly opposing law and politics is often misleading
because "all law is an instrument of policy broadly conceived" (Henkin
1979, p. 90). Put differently, a legal commitment is not an end in
itself. "The art of commitment", in Thomas Schelling's words, consists
indeed in "\[persuading\] enemies or allies that one would fight abroad,
under circumstances of great cost and risk" (Schelling 2008, p. 36). But
doing so "requires more than a military capability. It requires
projecting intentions. It requires having those intentions, even
deliberately acquiring them, and communicating them persuasively to make
other countries behave" (Schelling 2008, p. 36). The [solemn commitments
in which countries enter when they subscribe to **collective defence
treaties** is precisely]{.underline} such an [instrument to]{.underline}
"[communicate persuasively]{.underline}" [one's intentions
and]{.underline} to [influence]{.underline} those of [other parties
effectively]{.underline}, or at least [more effectively than
if]{.underline} those [commitments]{.underline} had [not]{.underline}
been [formalised into **legal documents**]{.underline}. In turn, this
[added credibility provided by legal commitments]{.underline} simply
[comes from]{.underline} the fact that the [respect of **legality** as
such remains]{.underline} a [concern in]{.underline} the conduct of
[international affairs]{.underline}. Although [states' deference
for]{.underline} the "**[sanctity]{.underline}**" [of
treaties]{.underline} should not be overblown, it is also true that
states try to live up to their legal obligations, or to appear as such,
and, what is also important, other states equally know this. A [formal
commitment]{.underline}, embodied in a mutual defence clause,
[serves]{.underline} in sum both [to **reassure allies**]{.underline}
and to discourage potential aggressors because reneging on them would
likely imply a higher loss of reputation (e.g. Morrow 2000).

**The most comprehensive and [only]{.underline} analysis concludes that
EU strategic autonomy is an [illusion]{.underline}.**

Determining whether Europe could achieve strategic autonomy anytime soon
if the U.S. pulls back from Europe requires a [careful examination
of]{.underline} the [**historical trajectory** and]{.underline} the
[current and likely future state of **European interests** and
capabilities]{.underline}. A number of existing studies have helpfully
examined important elements of European interests and capabilities that
are relevant for this counterfactual question, but a [more **systematic
analysis**]{.underline} is now needed.7 Regarding interests, [this
article provides the first **comprehensive analysis** and
coding]{.underline} of [national threat perceptions across **all of
Europe**]{.underline}, showing where each country now falls across a set
of categories of threat prioritization. Concerning capabilities, this
article adds to existing understandings of European shortfalls in
defense capacity by providing a [longitudinal assessment of European
territorial defense capabilities over the past three
decades]{.underline}; to the best of our knowledge, [this analysis is
the **first of its kind**]{.underline}.

Our analysis shows that [Europe is **ultimately characterized**
by]{.underline} "**[strategic cacophony]{.underline}**," namely
[profound]{.underline}, [continent-wide divergences across
all]{.underline} the [domains of national defense policies]{.underline},
most notably [threat perceptions]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} also by
**[fundamental capability shortfalls]{.underline}**.8 This [combination
of strategic cacophony and capability shortfalls imposes]{.underline} a
[**rigid limit** on]{.underline} the [capacity of Europeans
to]{.underline} "[step up]{.underline}" [in]{.underline} the [field of
defense and]{.underline} to [achieve strategic autonomy]{.underline}
anytime soon. Consequently, [even if the U.S. were to **fully
withdraw**]{.underline} from the continent, [for]{.underline} likely
[decades]{.underline} the [Europeans]{.underline} would [find themselves
**disunited** and unable to **cooperate sufficiently** to
mount]{.underline} a [credible deterrent and defense]{.underline} on
their own against external threats. To be clear, our claim is
probabilistic, not deterministic: we contend it is highly unlikely, not
impossible, for Europe to achieve strategic autonomy anytime soon if the
U.S. pulls back. And if even the major shock of a complete U.S.
withdrawal is very unlikely to push Europe away from its current
strategic cacophony and capability shortfalls, a partial U.S. withdrawal
--- a much more likely counterfactual --- would be even more unlikely to
produce this effect.

This [finding has important **policy implications**]{.underline} for
both Europe and America as well as major theoretical implications for
the ongoing U.S. grand strategy debate between proponents of "deep
engagement"9 and those who advocate a grand strategy of "restraint.10
With regards to this grand strategy debate, Europe is now actually the
key area of contention. Proponents of deep engagement support a greatly
reduced U.S. presence in the Middle East,11 while some prominent
advocates of restraint like John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt favor the
U.S. maintaining a forward presence in Asia.12 It is thus regarding
Europe where the grand strategy recommendations of deep engagement and
restraint diverge most clearly and significantly: all proponents of the
former maintain the U.S. should stay, while all advocates of the latter
advocate that it should leave. Our analysis indicates that the
[Europeans would for a **very long time** be unable to **autonomously
balance** Russia]{.underline} if U.S. pulled back. As a result, [the
continent]{.underline} would [become **significantly more vulnerable**
to Russian meddling and aggression]{.underline}. Furthermore, the
potential disappearance of a U.S.-backed [NATO]{.underline} would
undermine [the **only institutional framework** that]{.underline} has
[fostered **some degree of convergence** in Europe]{.underline} (at the
strategic, doctrinal and capability levels) and that has [partly
contained Europe's **strategic cacophony**]{.underline}, thereby [making
institutionalized intra-European defense cooperation **appreciably
harder**]{.underline}. Ultimately, the [optimistic notion]{.underline}
forwarded by restraint scholars that [Europe can easily]{.underline}
"**[pick up the pieces]{.underline}**" [and recreate an effective
security architecture following]{.underline} a [U.S. withdrawal is
**illusory**]{.underline}. The policy implication is
[straightforward]{.underline}: [if the U.S. truly wants Europe to be
stable]{.underline}, [it **needs to stay**]{.underline}.

//CYang

On the eve of NATO's Madrid Summit, one fact of European security has
become increasingly clear: [NATO is the **only feasible guarantor**
of]{.underline} the [security of European states and]{.underline}, thus,
the European Union's ([EU]{.underline}) objective of achieving
**[strategic autonomy]{.underline}** is [unlikely to become]{.underline}
a [reality]{.underline} anytime soon.

In the early days following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, it would have
been reasonable to expect the war would provide the necessary impetus
for the European Union to finally achieve strategic autonomy. Unity
develops in response to a common threat and Russia's attack demonstrated
its aggressive intentions. Moreover, the Russian threat was such a shock
that it seemed to cause a "sea change" in defense policy for many
European governments. The Biden administration had already rightfully
signaled that it would welcome greater European responsibility for
defense and security, as it would allow the United States to focus more
on the greater threat posed by China. In a further positive development,
the EU published a "Strategic Compass," outlining its plans for improved
defense and security cooperation, only a month after the Russo-Ukrainian
War began.

In the months since, however, it has become clear that European
strategic autonomy is unlikely to come to fruition anytime soon: the
[war]{.underline} has [increased the stakes and made
apparent]{.underline} the [risk]{.underline} involved [in
forming]{.underline} an [alternative to NATO]{.underline}, major EU
members [France and Germany]{.underline} have acted in ways that [cast
doubt on]{.underline} their [ability to lead]{.underline}, [and Sweden
and Finland's NATO application]{.underline} [demonstrates]{.underline}
that the [backing of the **U**nited **S**tates is the **only real
guarantee** against Russian aggression]{.underline}.

While European autonomy in defense and security has long been a goal,
President Donald Trump's criticism of NATO and expressed desire to
withdraw from the alliance, led many European policymakers to search for
alternatives to the Atlantic alliance. What do advocates of strategic
autonomy mean by the term? In a November 2019 interview with The
Economist Emmanuel Macron declared NATO's "brain death" and said "Europe
must become autonomous in terms of military strategy and capability,"
later claiming that "Europe has the capacity to defend itself." Within a
week of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Macron proclaimed that "Europe
must invest more in order to decrease its dependence on other continents
and to be able to decide for itself. In other words, it must become a
power that is both more independent and more sovereign." So, strategic
autonomy, in the view of its leading proponent, would mean an EU that is
capable of defending its members without assistance from the United
States.

[Russia's attack]{.underline} on February 24, 2022, [demonstrated
aggressive intentions **fundamentally greater** than
anything]{.underline} it has done [since the]{.underline} end of the
[Cold War]{.underline}. Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine
suggested to Europeans that a Russian attack on an EU or NATO member,
while not likely, is no longer unthinkable. Given this new reality, the
[stakes of choosing the right security architecture]{.underline} are
[higher than they have been for decades]{.underline}. [If European
countries bet on]{.underline} an [**unknown** and **untested**
EU]{.underline} for their defense, [they]{.underline} would [risk
attack]{.underline}, [territorial loss]{.underline}, [and]{.underline}
even [subjugation]{.underline}. Finally, while the early weeks of the
war demonstrated Russian military incompetence, experts warn that Russia
has learned from mistakes, retains destructive military capabilities,
and will likely use its oil and gas sales to rebuild its war machine.

[France and Germany]{.underline} --- the [EU's **top two
economies**]{.underline}, [largest military spenders]{.underline}, [and
**loudest advocates** for strategic autonomy]{.underline} --- have
[acted in ways that]{.underline} have [made strategic autonomy **less
likely**]{.underline}. First, many European leaders --- especially those
bordering Russia --- view French and German calls for Ukraine to make
compromises with Russia with great concern. From the perspective of
those countries most concerned with the Russian threat, the appeal to a
diplomatic solution could mean they are forced to give up territory for
the sake of the greater good. When asked recently about German mediation
attempts, an Eastern European diplomat said "\[w\]e don't need German
protection; history proved it to be on the wrong side of history."
Second, there is a well-documented gap between the military capacity of
EU member states and what they would need to be truly autonomous in
defense. Despite initial indications to the contrary, it now [seems
**increasingly unlikely**]{.underline} that [Germany will engage
in]{.underline} a [**significant change** in its defense spending and
strategic culture]{.underline}, which will thwart the move towards
European strategic autonomy. Aside from the contribution Germany --- as
the EU's wealthiest member --- will not make toward enhanced European
defense capacity, its [inaction]{.underline} will [signal to **other
Europeans**]{.underline} that are still not bothered by the Russian
threat that [it is fine to return to]{.underline} the [**pre-war
levels** of defense spending]{.underline}. Finally, there is the issue
of France's nuclear arsenal. The United States has extended its nuclear
deterrent to cover NATO members, whereas France's nuclear arsenal
defends its territory and vital interests, not the EU or NATO.

The recent [decision by]{.underline} the governments of [Sweden and
Finland to apply for NATO membership is the **death knell** for EU
strategic autonomy]{.underline}. Both countries are EU members, so both
should --- in theory --- be protected by the Lisbon Treaty's Article 42
defense clause. Moreover, both countries understand that the act of
applying to NATO would draw Russia's ire and potential coercive measures
to keep them out of the alliance and impose costs on them. They also
knew that there would be at least a few months between when they applied
for membership and when they received the full protection of NATO's
Article V mutual defense clause (Turkey's objections have extended that
timeline). As such, [if they believed]{.underline} that [EU strategic
autonomy could provide them with sufficient protection]{.underline} from
Russia in the near to medium term, [it would have been rational
to]{.underline} continue to [remain **outside** of NATO]{.underline}.
But Sweden and Finland have chosen otherwise. A May 2022 Swedish Foreign
Affairs report stated: "[It is clear]{.underline} that [there
is]{.underline} a [lack of **political will**]{.underline} among EU
Member States [to develop **collective defence** within the
EU]{.underline}." While NATO certainly faces challenges, [Sweden and
Finland's applications suggest the alliance provides]{.underline} a
[better **security blanket**]{.underline} against a Russian attack than
the EU.

What if Donald Trump or a Trump-aligned, NATO-critical Republican wins
the 2024 U.S. presidential election? Wouldn't that outcome force
Europeans to return to strategic autonomy? First, given the American
public's bipartisan concern with the threat posed by Russia since its
attack on Ukraine, it would not be politically expedient for a
Republican nominee to emphasize criticisms of NATO in the way that Trump
did previously. Second, while Trump's rhetorical criticisms of NATO were
fierce, his administration's policies toward the alliance were quite
favorable. Finally, the Russo-Ukrainian War is likely to lead more NATO
states to meet the 2 percent of gross domestic product defense spending
goal, lessening one of Trump's most salient criticisms of the alliance.

[Given]{.underline} the [**death** of EU strategic autonomy]{.underline}
--- and the United States' continued interest in European security ---
[NATO]{.underline} will [remain the **critical security
mechanism**]{.underline} for Europe. The [**U**nited
**S**tates]{.underline} will [have to **remain engaged** in
Europe]{.underline}, even as it focuses more on Asia, though it should
be able to use the residual threat from Moscow to leverage greater
European contributions to their own defense.

Statements made by candidate and now-President Donald Trump on the US
commitment to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) have caused
much [consternation]{.underline} **[throughout]{.underline}** [the
alliance over the past year]{.underline}. President Trump has previously
[suggested]{.underline} that [US support for NATO]{.underline} [should
be]{.underline} **[conditional]{.underline}** [on nations paying their
fair share]{.underline}, with former-President Obama assuring the world
after the election that Mr. Trump would be fully committed to the
alliance.\[i\] Since taking office, President Trump has vacillated on
support for NATO. He contradicted Defense Secretary James Mattis by
stating NATO is obsolete, but then made an about-face to declare support
for the alliance.\[ii\] [[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} [[has]{.mark}
[weathered]{.mark} its]{.underline} **[share of
[crises]{.mark}]{.underline}** [over its nearly 70 years of
existence]{.underline}. [While]{.underline} **[unlikely]{.underline}**
in the short term, [it is worth considering whether the alliance could
survive]{.underline} **[without]{.underline}** [the]{.underline}
unconditional backing of the **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates given President Trump's unclear intentions.

On paper, [NATO]{.underline} has the potential to be
**[viable]{.underline}** as a collective security organization [without
the United States]{.underline}. [[Remove]{.underline}
[the]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates from the equation [and [NATO
retains]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[27]{.underline}]{.mark}** member
[[states]{.underline}]{.mark} with nearly 600 million people\[iii\] [and
a]{.underline} combined nominal [[GDP of]{.underline}]{.mark} almost
\$**[[20 trillion]{.underline}]{.mark}**.\[iv\] This should be [more
than adequate to build a self-sufficient military
infrastructure]{.underline}. A majority of NATO's members are also
deeply connected both politically and economically through the European
Union.\[v\] In the long term, a NATO without the United States may not
only be feasible, but desirable. **[However]{.underline}**,
[these]{.underline} rosy structural [facts belie a
[more]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[troublingly]{.underline}**]{.mark}
[reality in NATO's [immediate future]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

When looking at NATO's [short-term viability]{.underline}, the
[picture]{.underline} [is]{.underline} **[far less]{.underline}**
[positive]{.underline} [without]{.underline} [the]{.underline}
substantial commitment of the [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates.
The most obvious item of [concern]{.underline} if the US were to leave
or moderate its commitment to NATO [in the]{.underline} [short
term]{.underline} [would be]{.underline} **[[sheer
manpower]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In 2016, the alliance had a combined
troop strength of around 3.1 million active duty personnel. [Without
the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, [that
immediately]{.underline} **[[drops by]{.mark} nearly
[half]{.mark}]{.underline}** to somewhere below 1.9 million
personnel.\[vi\] This ignores [thousands of pieces of [military
equipment]{.mark}]{.underline} that [would]{.underline} [**[no
longer]{.underline}** [support]{.underline}]{.mark} [NATO,]{.underline}
including [armored vehicles, aircraft, and ships]{.underline}. Granted,
Russia---the most prominent threat to NATO---has significantly cut down
its active duty forces in recent years, estimated at just over 900,000
active duty personnel in 2016.\[vii\] However, the exact [number
of]{.underline} [**[reservists]{.underline}**
[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} [[has]{.mark} at its disposal]{.underline}
is unknown, and [could be]{.underline} anywhere [from]{.underline} **[[2
to 20 million]{.underline}]{.mark}** personnel depending on the scale of
a call up.\[viii\] While NATO forces may have an advantage in training,
equipment, and organization, past a certain point [quantity surpasses
quality]{.underline}. [Russia]{.underline} has also been **[increasing
efforts]{.underline}** to [update its military arsenal]{.underline},
purchasing new weapons and equipment to close that gap as well.\[ix\]

The more important [question]{.underline}, however, may be [who would
assume]{.underline} the burden of **[leadership]{.underline}** [for the
alliance in the absence of the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates. Among the most influential of NATO's members,
there is **[[no obvious candidate]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[to
take]{.mark} the [lead]{.mark} if the United States were to step
aside]{.underline}, and all the obvious candidates face their own
significant political issues at home and abroad. The
[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[K]{.underline}]{.mark}ingdom's
[relationship]{.underline} with continental Europe has been
**[strained]{.underline}** in the [after]{.underline}math of [its vote
to [leave]{.mark} the [EU]{.mark}]{.underline}. Its relationship will be
further tested in the months and years to come as that process plays
out.\[x\] [[Germany]{.mark}'s]{.underline} President-elect, former
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, has **[broken]{.underline}**
[with]{.underline} Chancellor Angela Merkel's governing coalition with
[a more conciliatory tone towards Russia]{.underline}. He has
**[[criticized]{.mark} NATO]{.underline}** policies on sanctions and
military exercises.\[xi\] Meanwhile, [[France]{.underline}]{.mark}
remains in a [constant state of]{.underline} **[[high
alert]{.underline}]{.mark}** [following]{.underline} a string of
[terrorist attacks]{.underline} over the past several years---a threat
it is not alone in facing---with new plots being uncovered and thwarted
in February and troops remaining deployed on the streets.\[xii\]

These existing political issues are aggravated by the fact that the UK,
Germany, and France all face populist or nationalist surges in their
domestic politics, a trend seen across Europe. The UK Independence Party
played an instrumental role in Britain's decision to leave the EU.
National Front candidate Marine Le Pen is highly likely to make it to
the second round of the French presidential election this year. The
Alternative for Germany party of Frauke Petry and Jorg Meuthen seems
poised to gain its first seats in the Bundestag following elections this
fall. Among a laundry list of controversial policy positions, these
parties have tended to either have highly critical views of NATO, close
ties to Russia, or both.\[xiii\] While the United States is obviously
not without its own domestic political issues, the relative size, power,
and strength of its institutions all put it in a better position to
simultaneously deal with such issues and wrangle NATO at the same time.
It is [questionable if]{.underline} **[Britain]{.underline}**,
**[France]{.underline}**, [or]{.underline} **[Germany]{.underline}**
[would be able to do the same if the mantle of leadership fell upon
them.]{.underline}

[If the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [were
to]{.underline} **[leave NATO]{.underline}** in the next four years,
**[even]{.underline}** if [the [alliance]{.mark}]{.underline} **[were
[not]{.mark}]{.underline}** [to [collapse]{.mark}
immediately]{.underline}, the ensuring [vacuum]{.underline} would [call
into [question]{.mark}]{.underline} its **[[short-term
survivability]{.underline}]{.mark}**. But even if President Trump does
not truly plan to leave NATO, [the longer the]{.underline}
**[[doubt]{.underline}]{.mark}** [over continued US
participation]{.underline}, [the]{.underline} **[greater
damage]{.underline}** this [uncertainty creates. It]{.underline}
[encourages]{.underline} **[political forces]{.underline}** [within
member states]{.underline} **[not consistent]{.underline}** [with NATO's
values]{.underline} and it may [[encourage]{.underline}]{.mark}
potential **[[adversaries]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[to
undertake]{.underline}]{.mark} **[provocative]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[[aggressive]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[actions]{.underline}]{.mark}. [It is critical that]{.underline}
President Trump be [more consistent and clear in voicing his desire to
remain in the alliance, and]{.underline} frame whatever criticisms he
has of NATO---which are not baseless---in the context of improving the
alliance. It is also critically important that the President strive to
set a better domestic political example for NATO allies as they face
increasing levels of political instability and uncertainty of their own.
More than his own approval ratings may be riding on his ability to be a
unifying political figure.

[NATO]{.underline} formally [invited Finland and]{.underline}
[Sweden]{.underline} to join on Wednesday [after Turkey [dropped its
opposition](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/06/28/politics/joe-biden-g7-nato/index.html)]{.underline} following

its [deepening fault
lines](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/01/25/business/russia-putin-nord-stream-2-gas-pipeline-intl-cmd/index.html).

Finnish President Sauli Niinistö said that Ankara had agreed to support
the membership bids of his country and Sweden, removing a major hurdle
to the two joining the alliance.

While the move was a big win for NATO and a setback for Russia, Turkish
President Recep Tayyip [Erdogan]{.underline} [didn't give in without a

a display of his nation's weight in the grouping.

Before signing a joint memorandum with the two Nordic nations, Erdogan
on Tuesday declared that NATO "cannot afford" to lose Turkey as a
member. He was responding to frustration in the Western alliance

A More Secure Transatlantic Community

[We have]{.underline} [**noted questions** whether]{.underline}
**[Sw]{.underline}**edish and F**[innish]{.underline}** [accession to
NATO would **lessen** the **focus on security** in other]{.underline}
geographic **[areas]{.underline}** of concern to the alliance. [These
are **legitimate concerns**]{.underline} that we would like to address.
[It is true that **first** and **foremost** the contributions from a
Swedish perspective]{.underline} **[would be towards collective
defense]{.underline}** in the Baltic Sea region and the High North.
[This is a **simple fact of geography**]{.underline}. [But it also
**aligns with clear NATO priorities**]{.underline} since the 2014 Wales
Summit and onwards. [Both Sweden's and Finland's
**accession**]{.underline} to the alliance, **[would]{.underline}** (as
we have argued) [make]{.underline} operational [**planning** and
**preparations** for]{.underline} collective [defense]{.underline}
scenarios **[easier]{.underline}**, which in turn **[would enhance
deterrence]{.underline}**.

[This]{.underline} [does not mean,]{.underline} though, that [Sweden
should be viewed as being **oblivious**]{.underline} to the threats and
security challenges in other parts of the alliance nor that Sweden or
any other Nordic state is disinterested in the development of European
capabilities. For example, [all Nordic countries hold a **strong
record** for]{.underline} [**commitment** to international
peace]{.underline} and security through the United Nations, NATO, the
European Union, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe,
as well as coalitions of the willing. Just recently [Sweden contributed
with a **substantial special forces**]{.underline} contingent to the
French-led Task Force Takuba in the Sahel. Norway, Denmark, Finland, and
Sweden are all members of the European Intervention Initiative and, as
previously noted, the Danish electorate just voted to end Denmark's
opt-out from E.U. defense and security policy. It is safe to say then
that as a NATO member Sweden would take its responsibilities and duties
towards all of its allies seriously. This includes subscribing to the
importance of nuclear deterrence as a core part of NATO's doctrines,
concepts, and policies.

The Nordic states have previously been highlighted as a role model for
other subregions in how to deepen cooperation in the defense and
security realm. [With a Swedish and Finnish accession]{.underline} to
NATO, [there will be even **greater opportunities** to
**harmonize**]{.underline}, [coordinate]{.underline}, [and]{.underline}
even **[integrate defense policies]{.underline}** [and
maximize]{.underline} the **[aggregate]{.underline}** collective
[military potential]{.underline} of the Nordic states. This could both
be a strategic bulwark in Northern Europe and a template for other U.S.
allies to replicate. The Nordic states can help in showing that
cooperation between smaller states who share a similar cultural,
political, and economic heritage can be a force multiplier, which would
be a win for the United States and NATO as a whole. Even without
identical security allegiances, the Nordic states have come far in
working together, and if all five are in NATO, the future is promising.

Moreover, [despite the **exaggerated**]{.underline} wailing and
[gnashing of teeth that typically **accompanied**]{.underline} such
[refusals to fulfill what some saw as **Uncle Sam's word**]{.underline},
**[nothing much happened]{.underline}**. In general, [America's
relationships **remained unchanged**]{.underline} despite such incidents
over the years. [Allies still **cooperated** with
Washington]{.underline}. Friendly combatants still cooperated with US
troops. Friends still complained while doing nothing when America failed
to fulfill imaginary obligations. Indeed, one could argue that the
impact on other states was too small, since populous and prosperous
Asian and European governments still leeched off the American military
rather than build up their own defenses. None of these episodes appeared
to deter rampant cheap riding on US service members and taxpayers. Uncle
Sam was still uniformly treated as Uncle Sucker.

[**Nor did** adversaries **take advantage** of]{.underline} such
[incidents]{.underline} to launch blitzkriegs and amass empires. [The
U.S.S.R. did not **overrun Europe**]{.underline}. [**North Korea** did
**not attack the South**.]{.underline} [**Vietnam** did not **seize
Thailand**]{.underline}. China did not bombard, blockade, or invade
Japan and the Philippines. Iran did not occupy Saudi Arabia. Russia did
not capture Ukraine. [There have been plenty of]{.underline}
confrontations, **[firefights]{.underline}**, and attacks around the
world, [but which **resulted** from lost **American
"credibility"?**]{.underline} The problem was that the US went to war
far too often, creating more problems than it solved, despite its many
previous failures.

Indeed, the endless claims about credibility ignore the fact that allies
and adversaries alike are able to judge differences in commitment,
relationship, and interest. The US fought two wars over Europe, with
which Americans have strong ties. A willingness to go another decade in
Afghanistan, which is essentially a geopolitical irrelevancy to the US,
matters not at all. Similarly, the status of South Korea and Japan
matter much more to Washington than stability in Central Asia.

The credibility argument went from the sublime to the ridiculous when
applied to Syria's Kurds, with whom America worked against the Islamic
State. When President Donald Trump proposed bringing home US troops
Washington's War Party erupted into cacophonous shock and outrage.
America was over as a global power! Americans forevermore would have to
hang their heads in shame! The American experiment was coming to a
desultory end!

Yet from what stemmed this alleged sacred and vital commitment? The
Kurds, not Americans, were directly threatened by ISIS, which was
attempting to create a caliphate, or quasi‐​nation state, which would
have consumed what is called Rojava or Syrian Kurdistan. Washington
aided the Kurds, who were not fighting as an act of charity, but to
defend themselves.

[The relationship was **transactional**]{.underline}, since the US ---
[neither the **president nor Congress**]{.underline} --- [made any
**long‐​term**]{.underline} defense [commitment]{.underline}, [and
**certainly not against neighboring Turkey**]{.underline}, an American
treaty ally. In fact, Washington's departure would have prioritized
official ties, in this case formalized by the NATO treaty, which was
ratified by Congress. The furor over Trump's proposal to leave Syria
after fulfilling America's security objectives was purely political,
reflecting attacks by Democratic partisans, who hoped to damage the
president even when he did the right thing, and Republican uber‐​hawks,
who supported every endless war, irrespective of the cost to America. If
US credibility was at stake, it was only because Trump's critics claimed
that it was.

[Where credibility is]{.underline} genuinely [at **issue**]{.underline},
promises [and commitments should **not be lightly made**]{.underline}.
The interests involved should be serious and the guarantees should be in
America's interest. If these conditions are not met, theoretical
concerns about credibility cannot justify sticking with a failed policy.
Sacrificing wealth and, more important, lives in the name of the
credibility chimera not just bad policy. It is immoral policy.

[Afghanistan ended **tragically**]{.underline}, [but that was
**inevitable**]{.underline} [once Washington shifted]{.underline} [from
**responding to 9/11** to]{.underline} [imposing a
Western]{.underline}‐​style **[government]{.underline}**. [If future
policymakers]{.underline} [are **concerned** about]{.underline} the
impact on **[credibility]{.underline}**, [they **should take that risk
into account**]{.underline} [before making **foolish**]{.underline},
counterproductive [commitments]{.underline}. Although [America's
**credibility**]{.underline} [is likely to **survive another bad
exit**]{.underline}, their own might not.

create some overlap and institutional friction, this would be a rather
small bureaucratic concern---one that could easily be addressed by
better EU-NATO coordination. Yet the bureaucratic worry over duplication
has been elevated to such an extent that it has become untethered from
its actual significance, which is quite minor. Instead of fretting over
bureaucratic trivia, the United States and NATO should focus on
incorporating the EU defense effort into NATO and embedding the EU in
the Atlantic framework

Threat?" War on the Rocks; June 22, 2020;
<https://warontherocks.com/2020/06/corona-and-bioterrorism-how-serious-is-the-threat/>)

[How serious is the threat? There is a long history of terrorists being
fascinated by biological weapons, but it is also one of
failures]{.underline}. For the vast majority, **[the [technical]{.mark}
[challenges]{.mark} associated [with]{.mark} weaponizing
[biological]{.mark} [agents]{.mark} [have]{.mark} [proven
insurmountable]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The only reason this could change
is if terrorists were to receive support from a state. Rather than panic
about terrorists engaging in biological warfare, governments should be
vigilant, secure their own facilities, and focus on strengthening
international diplomacy. A History of Failures Biological warfare, which
uses organisms and pathogens to cause disease, is nearly as old as war
itself. The first known use of biological agents as a weapon dates back
to 600 B.C., when an ancient Greek leader poisoned his enemies' water
supply. Throughout the Middle Ages, especially during the time of the
Black Death, it was common to hurl infected corpses into besieged
cities. And during the two world wars, all major powers maintained
biological weapons programs (although only Japan used them in combat).
[Among terrorists]{.underline}, however, [the use of biological weapons
has been rare]{.underline}r, although groups from nearly all ideological
persuasions have contemplated it. Recent examples include a plot to
contaminate Chicago's water supply in the 1970s; food poisoning by a
religious cult in Oregon in the 1980s; and the stockpiling of ricin by
members of the Minnesota Patriot Council during the 1990s. [[No one
died]{.mark} in any]{.underline} of these [instances]{.underline}. [The
same is true for the biological warfare programs of al-Qaeda and the
Islamic State group]{.underline}. Both groups have sought to buy, steal,
or develop biological agents. For al-Qaeda, this seems to have been a
priority in the 1990s, when its program was overseen by (then) deputy
leader Ayman al-Zawahiri, a trained physician. With the Islamic State,
evidence dates back to 2014, when Iraqi forces discovered thousands of
files related to biological warfare on a detainee's laptop. Yet [none of
these efforts succeeded]{.underline}. [The only al-Qaeda plot in which
bioterrorism featured prominently]{.underline} --- the so-called "ricin
plot" in England in 2002 --- [was interrupted at such an early stage
that none of the toxin had actually been produced]{.underline}. [The
Islamic State's most serious attempt]{.underline}, in 2017, [involved a
small amount of ricin, whose only fatality was the hamster on which it
was tested. Of the tens of thousands of people that jihadists have
murdered, not a single one has died from biological agents.]{.underline}
It may be no accident that the most lethal bioterrorist attack in recent
decades was perpetrated by a scientist and government employee. In late
2001, the offices of several U.S. senators and news organizations
received so-called "anthrax letters," which killed five people and
injured 17. Following years of investigation, the FBI identified the
sender as Bruce Ivins, a PhD microbiologist and senior researcher at the
U.S. Army's Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases. Unlike
the others, he was no amateur or hoaxer, but a trained expert with years
of experience and full access to the world's largest repository of
lethal biological agents. Technical Challenges Ivins' case helps to
explain why so many would-be bioterrorists have failed. At a technical
level, [[launching]{.mark} [a]{.mark} sophisticated,
[large-scale]{.mark} bioterrorist [attack]{.mark} [involves]{.mark}
[a]{.mark} toxin or a [pathogen]{.mark} --- generally a bacterium or a
virus --- [which needs to be isolated]{.mark} and
disseminated]{.underline}. But [[this]{.mark} [is]{.mark} more
[difficult]{.mark} than it seems.]{.underline} As well as advanced
training in biology or chemistry, is[olating the agent requires
significant experience. [It]{.mark} [also]{.mark} [has to be
done]{.mark} [in]{.mark} [a]{.mark} safe, [contained
environment]{.mark}, [to stop it from]{.mark} [spreading within the
terrorist group]{.mark}]{.underline}. Contrary to what al-Qaeda said in
one of its online magazines, [**[you can't just make a (biological)
weapon]{.mark}**]{.underline} "in the kitchen of your mom!" In addition,
[there is the challenge of dissemination]{.underline}. Unless the agent
is super-contagious, [a powerful biological attack relies on a large
number of initial infections in perfect conditions.]{.underline} In the
case of the bacterium anthrax, for example, [only spores of a particular
size are likely to be effective in certain kinds of weather.
State-sponsored programs often needed years of testing and
experimentation to understand how their weapons could be
used]{.underline}. Though not impossible, [**[it is unlikely
that]{.mark} [terrorist]{.mark} [groups]{.mark} [possess the resources,
stable environment]{.mark},** and patience to do likewise.]{.underline}
Doomsday Scenarios [Even if terrorists somehow succeeded, it is nearly
inconceivable that the resulting "weapon" would be as powerful as the
recent coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2.]{.underline} One of its uniquely
devastating features has been that people are infectious while
experiencing no symptoms. As it spread across the globe, there was no
treatment, no vaccine, an incomplete understanding of its pathological
modes of action, and no easy, cheap and widely available testing. It was
the viral equivalent of a "zero-day exploit" --- a cyber-attack that
happens before any patch is available. [None of the viruses on the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's list of the most dangerous
biological agents could be easily "weaponized" or would have the same,
devastating effects as SARS-CoV-2. Pathogenic viruses such as smallpox,
Ebola, Marburg, and Lassa are extremely hard to find, isolate, and
spread. Botulinum and ricin are dangerous toxins, but not contagious,
while Tularemia cannot be transmitted from human to human. The plague
is, of course, capable of causing pandemics, but most countries are
nowadays well prepared for this particular virus, and will be able to
limit --- and cope with --- localized outbreaks.]{.underline} This
leaves only anthrax, a soil bacterium which is relatively easy to
obtain. Even so, [isolating a highly pathogenic strain is
difficult]{.underline}. More importantly, [anthrax is not
contagious]{.underline}, and while its spores are durable and affected
areas can be hard to de-contaminate, it is unable to spread on its own.
[Regarding SARS-CoV-2, it is important to distinguish between the
possibility that the virus occurred naturally and escaped from a
laboratory, and the idea that it was engineered for maximum
infectiousness and deliberately released]{.underline}. [The]{.underline}
first remains a [possibility]{.underline}, although other explanations
are equally --- if not more --- plausible, while the second [has been
debunked by a comprehensive examination]{.underline} in the journal
Nature Medicine, [which concluded that **SARS-CoV-2 was "not a
laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus." [The
chances]{.mark} that terrorists would be capable of engineering a virus
such as SARS-CoV-2 [without access to a state's resources]{.mark} [are
virtually zero]{.mark}.**]{.underline} If anything, the possibility of a
lab escape --- however remote --- highlights the importance of
biosafety. While [governments have paid much attention to
laboratories]{.underline} with the highest biosafety level (level 4),
work on bat-born coronaviruses is regularly performed at lower levels
(level 3, and even level 2), and should instead be subject to similar
safety requirements. In sum, small-[scale attacks using anthrax or other
agents may be possible]{.underline}, **[but the risk of a highly
advanced, weaponized pathogen that spreads among large populations --- a
terrorist-initiated biological doomsday --- is very low]{.underline}**.
The only exception, of course, is if terrorists received support from a
state, acted as its proxies, or were able to draw on its resources ---
as in Ivins' case.

The bioterror WMD myth. [Those who have **overemphasized**]{.underline}
the [[bioterror]{.underline}]{.mark}ism threat typically [portray it as
an **imminent concern**, with emphasis]{.underline} placed [on
**high-consequence, [mass-casualty attack]{.mark}**s]{.underline},
performed with weapons of mass destruction (WMD). [This [is a
myth]{.mark}]{.underline} with two dimensions. The first involves the
identities of terrorists and what their intentions are. The [assumption
is that terrorists would seek]{.underline} to produce **[mass-casualty
weapons]{.underline}** and pursue capabilities on the scale of 20th
century, state-level bioweapons programs. Most **[leading
[bio]{.mark}logical disarmament [and]{.mark} non-[prolif]{.mark}eration
[experts]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[believe]{.underline}]{.mark} that the
risk of a small-scale bioterrorism attack is very real and present. But
they consider [[the risk]{.mark} of]{.underline} sophisticated
**[large-scale bioterrorism attacks [to be]{.mark} quite
[small]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [This]{.underline} judgment
[is]{.underline} [backed]{.underline} up [by **[historical]{.mark}
evidence**]{.underline}. The three confirmed
[[attempts]{.underline}]{.mark} to use biological agents against humans
in terrorist attacks [in the past [were
**small-scale**]{.mark}]{.underline}, low-casualty events aimed at
causing panic and disruption rather than excessive death tolls. The
second dimension involves capabilities and the level of skills and
resources available to terrorists. The implicit [assumption is that
producing a pathogenic organism equates to producing a
weapon]{.underline} of mass destruction. **[It does not.]{.underline}**
[Considerable [knowledge and resources]{.mark} are [necessary
for]{.mark}]{.underline} the processes of **[[scaling]{.mark} up,
[storage, and dissemination]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [These]{.underline}
processes [[present]{.underline} **[significant]{.underline}**]{.mark}
technical and logistical **[[barriers]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[[Even
if]{.underline}]{.mark}** [a]{.underline} biological [weapon were
disseminated **[successful]{.mark}**ly]{.underline}, the outcome of an
attack would be affected by factors like the health of the people who
are exposed and the speed and manner with which public health
authorities and medical professionals detect and respond to the
resulting outbreak. A prompt response with effective [[medical
countermeasures]{.mark}, such as antibodies and vaccination, can
**[significantly blunt the impact]{.mark} of an attack**.]{.underline}

[The threat of terrorists using biological agents exists but is very
limited]{.underline}. The fear of nonstate actors using biological
agents rose with Aum Shinrikyo's 1995 failed efforts to spread botulinum
and anthrax in Japan. [Fears of bioterror reached its most recent
crescendo with the 2001 anthrax letter mailings, coming as they did
within weeks after the 9/11 attacks. The [threat of]{.mark} further
[bioterror]{.mark} attacks, however, [never
materialized]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

Despite the fact that terrorist biological weapons attacks have not
materialized since the Amerithrax scare, some continue to argue that the
supposed ease and lower cost of biological weapons development,
production, and use along with the societal disruption of COVID-19 has
incentivized bad actors to adopt biological weapons. These concerns have
been echoed by others who assume that misuse is inevitable and following
the COVID-19 example will result in mass casualties and crippling
political, societal, and economic repercussions.

However, [[the]{.mark} bioterror [threat]{.mark} seems to have
[diminished]{.mark}]{.underline} --- not grown --- [[since the]{.mark}
2001 [Amerithrax]{.mark} letter [mailings]{.mark}]{.underline}. The core
[[al-Qaeda bio]{.mark}logical [weapons]{.mark} efforts [were]{.mark}
first [envisioned in the]{.mark} late 19[90s]{.mark} and began in
earnest shortly afterward. [Yet]{.mark} the]{.underline} U.S. invasion
of Afghanistan and the [[fall of the Taliban]{.mark} in late 2001
effectively [disrupted]{.mark} al-Qaeda's biological weapons
[work]{.mark} which largely centered on anthrax.]{.underline} Left
without a suitable safe haven, al-Qaeda was never able to reconstitute
its biological weapons efforts. The Taliban's return to power in
Afghanistan, however, may result in a reemergence of al-Qaeda and its
biological weapons ambitions. Time will tell whether the Taliban now
will grant safe haven to al-Qaeda that could be used for biological
weapons work. What is undoubted is that the Taliban and al-Qaeda have a
shared history and have continued to work closely together. Without a
presence in Afghanistan, U.S. intelligence will have a more difficult
time detecting any resurgent al-Qaeda biological weapons efforts.

[The threat of a biological weapons effort by the [I]{.mark}slamic
[S]{.mark}tate in Iraq [never materialized]{.mark}, although the group
did manage to produce and use chemical weapons agents until that program
was effectively disrupted. [Other]{.mark} terrorist [groups'
interest]{.mark} in biological weapons [has been rudimentary with a
focus]{.mark} predominately [on]{.mark} toxins such as [ricin and
botulinum]{.mark}. U.S. [domestic extremists]{.mark}, self-radicalized
individuals, and lone actors [also]{.mark} have [gravitated toward
ricin, but **no known casualties** have resulted from the decades-long
interest in ricin.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Some analysts, however, argue that the life science revolution and
global proliferation of related scientific and technical capabilities
has opened a Pandora's Box of biothreats. The argument goes that the
rapid revolution in genetic engineering --- including synthetic biology
--- the DIY bio movement, and the advent of technologies like CRISPR
(acronym for "clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic
repeats") makes their misuse likely. However, as noted in the 2018
National Academies of Science report, Biodefense in the Age of Synthetic
Biology, [the large-scale production and delivery of biological weapons
agents is inherently difficult, with biological weapons use favoring
small-scale, highly targeted attacks.]{.underline}

Conclusion

[[The threat of]{.mark} intentional, large-scale [bio]{.mark}logical
[weapons]{.mark} dissemination likely [is a thing of the
past]{.mark}.]{.underline} Almost [no nation]{.underline}, with the
possible exception of North Korea, [is intent on the theater-wide
battlefield use of biological weapons.]{.underline} The threat today is
that [biological weapons will be used as a tool by intelligence services
to assassinate or debilitate high-value targets, or by special forces to
conduct small-scale, targeted attacks to sabotage facilities or deny
their use by an adversary]{.underline}. Use of non-lethal biological
weapons to degrade petroleum, oil, lubricants, and/or electronics almost
certainly is more feasible today. In the context of great-power
competition, biological weapons use also may be indirect (i.e.,
biological weapons use directed at a competitor's allies or
proxies/surrogates in a region). However, the recent chemical weapons
use in assassinations and the use of chemical weapons in Syria ---
followed by a tepid international response --- likely has incentivized
the future use and development of biological weapons agents.

[The novel coronavirus pandemic has put the threat of **bioterrorism**
back in the spotlight]{.underline}. White supremacist chat rooms are
teeming with talk about "biological warfare." ISIL even called the virus
"one of Allah's soldiers" because of its devastating effect on Western
countries. According to a recent memo by the U.S. Department of Homeland
Security, terrorists are "\[making\] bioterrorism a popular topic among
themselves." Both the United Nations and the Council of Europe have
warned of bioterrorist attacks.

[How serious is the threat? There is a long history of terrorists being
fascinated by biological weapons, but it is also one of
**failures**]{.underline}. For the vast majority, [the **[technical
challenges]{.mark}** associated [with **weaponizing
bio**]{.mark}**logical [agents]{.mark}** [have proven
**insurmountable**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The only reason this could
change is if terrorists were to receive support from a state. Rather
than panic about terrorists engaging in biological warfare, governments
should be vigilant, secure their own facilities, and focus on
strengthening international diplomacy.

A History of Failures

Biological warfare, which uses organisms and pathogens to cause disease,
is nearly as old as war itself. The first known use of biological agents
as a weapon dates back to 600 B.C., when an ancient Greek leader
poisoned his enemies' water supply. Throughout the Middle Ages,
especially during the time of the Black Death, it was common to hurl
infected corpses into besieged cities. And during the two world wars,
all major powers maintained biological weapons programs (although only
Japan used them in combat).

[Among terrorists]{.underline}, however, [the use of biological weapons
has been **rare**]{.underline}r, although groups from nearly all
ideological persuasions have contemplated it. [Recent examples include a
plot to contaminate Chicago's water supply in the 1970s; food poisoning
by a religious cult in Oregon in the 1980s; and the stockpiling of ricin
by members of the Minnesota Patriot Council during the
1990s.]{.underline} **[No one died]{.underline}** [in **any of these
instances**]{.underline}.

[The same is true for the biological warfare programs of [**al-Qaeda**
and the **I**]{.mark}slamic **[S]{.mark}**tate]{.underline} group. [Both
groups have [sought]{.mark}]{.underline} to buy, steal, or develop
[[bio]{.mark}logical [agents]{.mark}]{.underline}. For al-Qaeda, this
seems to have been a priority in the 1990s, when its program was
overseen by (then) deputy leader Ayman al-Zawahiri, a trained physician.
With the Islamic State, evidence dates back to 2014, when Iraqi forces
discovered thousands of files related to biological warfare on a
detainee's laptop.

Yet **[[none]{.mark} of these efforts [succeeded]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
[[The]{.mark} only [al-Qaeda plot]{.mark} in which bioterrorism featured
prominently]{.underline} --- the so-called "ricin plot" in England in
2002 --- [[was]{.mark} **[interrupted]{.mark}** at **such an early
stage** that none of the toxin had **actually been
produced**]{.underline}. [The Islamic State's most serious attempt, in
2017, involved a small amount of ricin]{.underline}, whose only fatality
was the hamster on which it was tested. [Of the **tens of thousands** of
people that jihadists have murdered, not a **single one has died** from
biological agents.]{.underline}

It may be no accident that the most lethal bioterrorist attack in recent
decades was perpetrated by a scientist and government employee. In late
2001, the offices of several U.S. senators and news organizations
received so-called "anthrax letters," which killed five people and
injured 17. Following years of investigation, the FBI identified the
sender as Bruce Ivins, a PhD microbiologist and senior researcher at the
U.S. Army's Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases. Unlike
the others, he was no amateur or hoaxer, but a trained expert with years
of experience and full access to the world's largest repository of
lethal biological agents.

Technical Challenges

Ivins' case helps to explain why so many would-be bioterrorists have
failed. [At a **technical level**, [launching a]{.mark}
**sophisticated**, **large-scale [bioterrorist attack]{.mark}**
[]{.mark}involves a toxin or a pathogen --- generally a bacterium or a
virus --- which [needs to be **isolated**]{.mark} and
**disseminated**]{.underline}. But [this is **more difficult than it
seems**. As well as [**advanced training** in biology]{.mark} or
chemistry, isolating the agent [requires **significant
experience**]{.mark}. It]{.underline} also [has to be done in a
**safe**, **contained** environment, to stop it from spreading
**within** the terrorist group]{.underline}. Contrary to what al-Qaeda
said in one of its online magazines, you can't just make a (biological)
weapon "in the kitchen of your mom!"

In addition, [there is the challenge of **dissemination**]{.underline}.
Unless the agent is super-contagious, [a powerful biological attack
relies on a **large number of initial infections** in **perfect
conditions**]{.underline}. In the case of the bacterium
[anthrax]{.underline}, for example, [only spores of a particular size
are likely to be effective in certain kinds of weather.
[State]{.mark}-sponsored [programs]{.mark} often [needed **years of
testing**]{.mark} and **experimentation** to understand how their
weapons could be used]{.underline}. Though not impossible, [[it]{.mark}
is **unlikely** that terrorist groups possess the **resources**,

1945]{.underline} (Gaddis, 1999, p. 268--271; Gavin, 2012a, p. 164;
Acton 2010, pp. 16--17). Still others have contended that
[[because]{.mark} nuclear **[prolif]{.mark}**eration [is]{.mark} such a
**[rare]{.mark}** phenomenon, [and]{.mark} since **[robust]{.mark}

[and, therefore,]{.underline} **[manageable]{.underline}** (Mueller
2010, pp. 95--99; Hymans 2013, pp. 293--296).

The question of whether nuclear proliferation has stabilising or
destabilising effects is not just fascinating for scholars of the
nuclear age, but also highly consequential for practical policy issues.
For in order to debate the merits of particular policy choices -- such
as preventive military strikes against nuclear facilities, grand
bargains with potential proliferators or complete nuclear disarmament --
we need to understand first how the spread of nuclear weapons impacts
regional and global security.

The chapter proceeds in three steps. The first section provides the
foundation for the other parts by summarising what we know about
empirical patterns of proliferation and the utility of nuclear weapons
for statecraft. The second section then engages the literature on the
consequences of proliferation, focusing in particular on how
proliferation has influenced international stability. The final section
explores whether some states have been more affected than others, and
what measures these states have taken to prevent proliferation, or at
least mitigate its negative consequences.

Patterns of nuclear proliferation and the utility of nuclear weapons

Nuclear proliferation is commonly defined as the spread of nuclear
weapons to states that did not previously have them. Within a broader
conceptual framework that is rarely used by scholars, yet popular in the
arms control community, this diffusion of nuclear weapons to additional
states is labelled horizontal proliferation. It is conceptually
accompanied by the notion of vertical proliferation, which refers to
qualitative improvements and increases in the number of nuclear weapons
in the stockpiles of existing nuclear weapon states. In accordance with
the typical usage of the term in the scholarly debate, this chapter
focuses only on how the horizontal proliferation of nuclear weapons
affects international stability.

One important empirical pattern that has shaped how nuclear
proliferation is understood concerns the way in which nuclear weapons
have spread. [The word]{.underline} **[['spread']{.underline}]{.mark}**
[appears to [suggest]{.mark} that the **established**]{.underline}
nuclear [[powers]{.mark} have]{.underline}
[**[provide]{.mark}**d]{.underline} [other interested nations with (at
least a few) operational nuclear [warheads.]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[[Yet]{.mark} such transfers have [never]{.mark} been
undertaken.]{.underline}** [Certainly, states that sought nuclear
weapons have often received]{.underline} significant
**[assistance]{.underline}** from other nations (Schofield, 2014;
Fuhrmann, 2012), [sometimes in the form of]{.underline} highly sensitive
**[tech]{.underline}**nologies (Kroenig, 2010).
[Nonetheless,]{.underline} since **[[all]{.underline}]{.mark}** these
transfers [[remained]{.underline}]{.mark} **[well
[below]{.mark}]{.underline}** [the]{.underline} **[[weapons]{.mark}
threshold]{.underline}**, nations seeking nuclear weapons always had to
build them indigenously. Hence, [in reality, the spread of nuclear
weapons has meant that merely the **ambition**]{.underline} [to possess
a nuclear arsenal has spread]{.underline} to additional states, each of
which then had to pursue that goal primarily through indigenous efforts.

[Importantly, since a state's national [efforts]{.mark} to turn
its]{.underline} **[desire]{.underline}** for nuclear weapons
[into]{.underline} **[reality]{.underline}** [naturally
[span]{.mark}]{.underline} several (and sometimes **[[many)
years]{.underline}]{.mark}**, nuclear **[prolif]{.underline}**eration
[must be conceived of as a]{.underline} **[process]{.underline}**, as
opposed to just a single step (Meyer, 1986). This point is reinforced by
the fact that **[[29]{.underline}]{.mark}** out **[[of
39]{.underline}]{.mark}** states [[that]{.mark} have]{.underline}
**[[embarked]{.underline}]{.mark}** [upon that path]{.underline} (Müller
and Schmidt, 2010, p. 157; Mikoyan, 2012; Santoro, 2017)
[h[ave]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[not acquired]{.mark} a]{.underline}**
nuclear **[arsenal]{.underline}**. Hence, a lot of nuclear proliferation
activity has been undertaken by nations that did not ultimately become
nuclear weapon states. Three patterns explain this situation.

First, [[owing]{.underline}]{.mark} not just [[to]{.mark}
the]{.underline} **[[tech]{.mark}nological]{.underline}**, but also the
[**[institutional]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[managerial
challenges]{.underline}**]{.mark} [of the task]{.underline}, some
[[nations]{.mark} simply **[failed]{.mark} in their
efforts**]{.underline} to build the bomb (Hymans, 2012;
Braut-Hegghammer, 2016). Second, a few countries have chosen a nuclear
'hedging' strategy, intentionally confining their efforts to developing
the technological capability to build an arsenal quickly while
refraining from exercising that option (Narang, 2016--17, p. 134).
Third, [[several]{.mark} states have **[undertake]{.mark}**n a '[nuclear
**reversal'**, **abandoning**]{.mark}]{.underline} [their]{.underline}
nuclear [weapons [activities]{.mark}]{.underline} before developing
nuclear explosive devices (Müller and Schmidt, 2010).

Conventional Wisdom among Policy Makers, Less Support from Scholars

The [literature on extended nuclear guarantees broadly divides into
policy-focused work arguing that such guarantees]{.underline}---if
properly calibrated---[can prevent allied nuclear
proliferation]{.underline} and prescribing mechanisms for increasing
their credibility (Congressional Commission 2009; Schlesinger 2008) [and
academically oriented research **examining whether** **guarantees can be
credible** in the first place]{.underline}.

[Although]{.underline} the [policy [literature]{.mark} considers which
factors may affect **credibility**]{.underline} (Murdock 2009), [its
**primary [limitation]{.mark}** [is **assuming** guarantees can]{.mark}
be effective in [stem]{.mark}ming allied [prolif]{.mark}eration. The
[lit]{.mark}erature presents a toolbox of options for how to increase
credibility, but [gives **short shrift** to]{.mark} the prior question
of [whether]{.mark} **security [guarantees]{.mark}** can
**[prevent]{.mark} allied [prolif]{.mark}**eration]{.underline}.

The academic literature on guarantees also has shortcomings. Some argue
guarantees do not stem allied proliferation because they are incredible
(Goldstein 2000), but base the conclusion on analysis of a few cases in
which allies chose to proliferate. [A modest but **[growing]{.mark}**
**quantitative [lit]{.mark}erature** [addresses]{.mark} the question of
[**why states do** and do not **prolif**]{.mark}**erate**, but reaches
**contradictory conclusions** on security guarantees]{.underline} (see
Table 1).

And none of these studies focused narrowly on guarantees---they were
either "garbage can" approaches that sought to test a host of
potentially relevant variables or focused on other independent
variables---and therefore did not subject their security guarantee
findings to robustness checks.

[Two recent studies catalyzed a resurgence of interest in applying
sophisticated quantitative tools to the proliferation
puzzle]{.underline}.4 [Employing hazard analysis, Singh and
Way]{.underline} (2004) [found that [states with
**nuclear**]{.mark}**-armed [allies]{.mark}** [were **neither**
less]{.mark} nor more [likely to explore]{.mark} **nuclear
[weapons]{.mark}** options]{.underline}, launch weapons programs, [or
acquire weapons. Multinomial [logit analysis]{.mark}, reported as a
robustness check, similarly **[found no relation]{.mark}ship** between
guarantees and states\' likelihood of launching weapons
programs]{.underline}, but did find a robust negative relationship to
both exploration and acquisition. [Jo and Gartzke]{.underline} (2007)
[employed [probit regression]{.mark} analysis and [concluded]{.mark}
that [states receiving]{.mark} security [guarantees were **no less
likely** to have]{.mark} active **[nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark}
programs**]{.underline}, though less likely to possess nuclear weapons.

Finally, two scholars tweaked Singh and Way\'s earlier work.
[[Kroenig]{.underline}]{.mark} (2009b) [[reported]{.mark} that two of
the three hazard models found a **[negative relationship]{.mark}**
between guarantees and acquisition, while one found **no relationship**.
In a subsequent 2010 book]{.underline} that conducted analysis along
similar lines yet came to the opposite conclusion, [Kroenig reported
that **[all four models]{.mark}** that controlled for guarantees [found
**no relation**]{.mark}**ship** to acquisition. Fuhrmann]{.underline}
(2009), [employing probit regression analysis]{.underline} but,
unusually, structured like Singh and Way\'s hazard analysis to drop
countries from the data set once they reach a given threshold, [reported
that all of his models found **no relationship** between **guarantees**
and **nuclear weapons program** initiation or acquisition]{.underline}.

These considerations help explain why [[alarmists have been **wrong for
decades** about the pace of]{.mark} nuclear [prolif]{.mark}eration.
[**Dozens** of]{.mark} technologically [capable countries]{.mark} have
[considered]{.mark} obtaining [nuclear arsenals]{.mark}, but [**very
few** have]{.mark} done so]{.underline}. Indeed, as Jacques Hymans has
pointed out, [even supposedly optimistic forecasts about nuclear
dispersion have proved to be too pessimistic]{.underline}.15 Thus, in
1958 the National Planning Association predicted "a rapid rise in the
number of atomic powers ... by the mid-1960s."16 A few years later C. P.
Snow sternly predicted, "Within, at the most, six years, China and
several other states \[will\] have a stock of nuclear bombs" while U.S.
President John Kennedy observed that there might be "ten, fifteen,
twenty" countries with a nuclear capacity by 1964.17

Such punditry has gone astray in part because the [pundits insist on
extrapolating from the wrong cases. A more pertinent prototype would
have been **Canada**]{.underline}, a country that could easily have had
nuclear weapons by the 1960s but declined to make the effort.18 In fact,
[over the decades, [a **huge number** of countries]{.mark} capable of
developing nuclear weapons have [neglected **even to consider** the
opportunity]{.mark}]{.underline}---for example, [**Canada**, **Italy**,
and **Norway**]{.underline}---even [as **Argentina**, **Brazil**,
**Libya**, **So**uth **Ko**rea, and **Taiwan** have backed away from or
reversed nuclear weapons programs,]{.underline} and [**Belarus**,
**Kazakhstan**, **South Africa**, and **Ukraine** have]{.underline}
actually [**surrendered** or **dismantled** an existing **nuclear
arsenal**]{.underline}.19 Some of that reduction is no doubt due to the
hostility of the nuclear nations, but even without that [the Canadian
case seems]{.underline} to have proved to have rather general relevance.
Its experience certainly [suggests]{.underline}, as Stephen Meyer has
shown, [there is no "technological imperative" for countries to obtain
nuclear weapons]{.underline} once they have achieved the technical
capacity to do so.20

In consequence, **[[alarmist predictions about]{.mark} proliferation
chains, [cascades]{.mark}, dominoes]{.underline}**, waves, avalanches,
epidemics, [and points of no return [have proved]{.mark} to be
[faulty]{.mark}. Insofar as [most leaders]{.mark} of most countries
(**even rogue ones**) have considered acquiring the weapons,
they]{.underline} have come to [[appreciate]{.mark} several defects:
nuclear [weapons are]{.mark} dangerous]{.underline}, distasteful,
[[costly]{.mark}, and [likely to rile the
neighbors]{.mark}]{.underline}. Moreover, as Hymans has demonstrated,
the [weapons have]{.underline} also [been **[exceedingly difficult to
obtain]{.mark}**]{.underline} for administratively dysfunctional
countries like Iran.21

[As part of that forecasting]{.underline}, [it has]{.underline}
generally [been assumed that nuclear weapons would]{.underline} [be
important status]{.underline} --- or virility --- symbols; therefore,
all advanced countries would want to have them in order to show how
"powerful" they were. Thus, France's de Gaulle opined in the 1960s, "[No
country without]{.underline} [an atom bomb could properly consider

possession of nuclear weapons largely determines a nation's rank in the
hierarchy of international
prestige."[10](https://www.cato.org/publications/publications/nuclear-alarmism-proliferation-terrorism#_ednref10)
In Gilpinian tradition, some analysts who describe themselves as
"realists" have insisted for years that Germany and Japan must soon come

Moreover, [like military prowess in]{.underline} [general]{.underline},
[the weapons have not proved]{.underline} [to be crucial status
symbols.]{.underline} As Robert Jervis has observed, "India, China, and
Israel may have decreased the chance of direct attack by developing

How much more status would Japan have if it possessed nuclear weapons?
Would anybody pay a great deal more attention to Britain or France if
their arsenals held 5,000 nuclear weapons, or would anybody pay much
less if they had none? Did China need nuclear weapons to impress the
world with its economic growth? Or with its Olympics? As Jennifer Mackby
and Walter Slocombe observe, "Germany, like its erstwhile Axis ally,
Japan, has become powerful because of its economic might rather than its
military might, and its renunciation of nuclear weapons may even have

The German political economist Benjamin Braun recently made an astute
observation about the editorial position of a German newspaper - in
fact, it is an observation about the German policy consensus in general.
"Eurobond? Never, it'll kill us all. Eurobomb? Bring it on."

Incomprehensibly, the [EU]{.underline} [is]{.underline} now
[discussing]{.underline} yet **[another]{.underline}** [field of
political integration]{.underline}: [a]{.underline} **[defence
union.]{.underline}** [But the]{.underline} big [task it
set]{.underline} itself **[20 years ago]{.underline}**
[remains]{.underline} (to put it politely) **[incomplete]{.underline}**.
Amongst other things agreed in the recent two-day EU summit was the need
to press ahead with defence strategic procurement and coordinating
capability. There is a 'Strategic Compass' plan for an 'EU Rapid
Deployment Capacity of up to 5,000 troops' and much more besides.

All this while [the EU's flagship scheme]{.underline} - **[monetary and
economic union]{.underline}** - [remains]{.underline}
**[dysfunctional]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[plagued]{.underline}** [by]{.underline} ever-widening
[imbalances]{.underline}. [Integration of banking]{.underline} has been
[going in the]{.underline} **[reverse direction]{.underline}**. The
[European]{.underline} [banking]{.underline} supervision
[system]{.underline} is up and running, but the
[dispute-resolution]{.underline} regime **[is a joke.]{.underline}** The
[debate on deposit insurance is **stuck**]{.underline}. And the impetus
for a capital markets union is lost. [This is not just a flaw, but a
**first-order policy failure.**]{.underline}

[Rather than fix this]{.underline}, the [E]{.underline}uropean
[U]{.underline}nion [is discussing a **security**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} **[defence union]{.underline}** - [another opportunity
for these attention-deficit]{.underline}, hyperactive disorder-afflicted
policy makers to pretend that they are pro-European[. If you can't do a
proper economic union, you should stop right there, and fix the problem.
**Otherwise**]{.underline} [you end up with a dysfunctional economic
union, an ineffective foreign policy regime and - to top it all - an
army that can\'t fight.]{.underline}

The future success of the EU will depend primarily on boring economic
matters like innovation and the capital markets union. [The EU will
require a]{.underline} **[eurobond]{.underline}**: [a real one, not a
'recovery fund' that is ultimately backstopped by national
governments.]{.underline} The purpose of a real eurobond is to stabilise
a currently-unstable monetary union, not to bankroll reform in member
states.

Storms lie ahead. Power structures in global banking are about to be
upended by a slew of fintech innovations: this requires banking reforms
and a capital markets union for Europe to participate fully. That (and
climate change) is what the EU needs to focus on. And for that to
happen, it needs treaty change.

But this is not going to happen. [The discussions are all about issues
like who gets to do what in Brussels]{.underline}. The [Russia
sanctions]{.underline} are turning into [a]{.underline} **[political
disaster]{.underline}**. You can't blame veto-wielding member states, or
the lack of quality majority voting. The [problem lies in the fact that
countries like Germany are allowed to pursue national economic
strategies at the expense of the union]{.underline}.

[So the European Union is now entering a twilight zone of reverse
integration - coupled with a sense that it is still moving forward
because it's talking about new projects]{.underline}.

[Putin's]{.underline} [speech]{.underline} [following]{.underline} the
Russian military [intervention in]{.underline} **[Ukraine]{.underline}**
[outlines Russia's justification]{.underline} on political and military
grounds. Putin show determination to intervene in Ukraine but left minds
doubtful about how much further Russia could go. Putin's way of
correcting the Russian Head of Intelligence Sergey Naryshkin implied
that the Russian military intervention in Ukraine would be limited.

But his subsequent speech indicates a shift of intention. Putin's
recognition of the independence of the self-proclaimed People's
Republics of Donetsk and Luhansk was an overlooked part of the speech.
Putin emphasized the absence of a Ukrainian identity and stressed its
Russian roots, demographic purification, Soviet investments and
favoritism to Ukraine, and the so-called Nazi-type ideology of the
Ukrainian leadership---all according to his reading the events.

[Russia's]{.underline} Political [Goals]{.underline} and Military
Objectives

Military objectives generally [target]{.underline}
**[achievable]{.underline}** [political goals]{.underline} and avoid
utopic adventures that may end up in devastation. It is proper to ask,
then, whether Russia's political goals are achievable. This question is
related to Russia's grand strategy. [Putin and his comrades represent a
generation that enjoyed the]{.underline} **[triumph]{.underline}** [of
the Russia-dominated Soviet Empire]{.underline}, [the]{.underline}
**[demise]{.underline}** [of the latter]{.underline}, [and
the]{.underline} [emergence as the]{.underline} **[Russian
Federation]{.underline}**. It seems **[highly likely]{.underline}**
[that a romantic yearning for the Russian imperial days of the 18th
century and the Communist Soviet system of the Cold War may be an
**underlying motivation.**]{.underline}

Russian political thinking praises Russian pride, but it is also
concerned with survival. [Russia]{.underline} [needs a]{.underline}
story to [keep]{.underline} its [continent-sized territory functioning
and to make its multiethnic yet Russified demography
resilien]{.underline}t. The **[danger]{.underline}** [for the Russian
leadership]{.underline} [is to experience a]{.underline} further
**[retreat]{.underline}** [that could make Russia a loose state on the
path of]{.underline} **[collapse]{.underline}**. Such a [concern
makes]{.underline} [Putin]{.underline} **[more assertive]{.underline}**
[and expansionist]{.underline}, [mainly across Russia's perceived sphere
of influence]{.underline}.

For instance, [Russia]{.underline} gained [leverage]{.underline}
[after]{.underline} [the]{.underline} **[Second Karabakh
War]{.underline}** [by asserting]{.underline} its military
[presence]{.underline} [at the]{.underline} **[heart of
Karabakh]{.underline}** [for an extendable five-year
period]{.underline}. The Kazakhstan [stalemate]{.underline} at the
beginning of 2022 [presented]{.underline} **[another
chance]{.underline}** [where Russia intervened]{.underline} [in
the]{.underline} **[Central Asian]{.underline}** [states]{.underline} in
order to maintain stability. Furthermore, [these regions
have]{.underline} **[energy reserves]{.underline}**
[satisfying]{.underline} [the appetite of energy seekers as Russia
i]{.underline}ndirectly prepared itself to challenge the energy demand
of the broader globe.

[Putin's statements indicate a]{.underline} "**[nationalist
imperialism]{.underline}**," [which could have destructive consequences
for]{.underline} **[regional]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[global
orders]{.underline}**---let alone Russia itself. [Putin's inclination is
nationalist since Russia is at the core of his argument]{.underline}. On
the other hand, nationalism in Russian thinking carries the risks of
provoking ultranationalism or Slavophobia once a success story is
concluded by tangible gains.

The **[revisionism]{.underline}** and irredentism [of Russia reveal
the]{.underline} **[limits]{.underline}** [of expansion]{.underline}
over the borders of former USSR states, with minor alterations. The
first group of states are the ones that became NATO members after 1997,
that were once the former "Allies of the Soviet Union" and that
proceeded with their democratic transition.

The second group are still struggling for a stable regime, like Belarus.
Russia coerces these countries to have pro-Russian regimes. The final
group are countries squeezed between NATO and Russia, and not yet NATO
member states, mainly Ukraine and Georgia.

[Putin]{.underline} has [employed]{.underline} [strategies]{.underline}
[to]{.underline} **[destabilize]{.underline}** [these states
through]{.underline} **[smart moves]{.underline}**, [which rest
on]{.underline} **[five]{.underline}** [political and military
strategies]{.underline}. [Russia]{.underline} successfully [achieves
these strategies by being **more discreet**]{.underline} [in terms of
international law, at least, until the aggression against Ukraine, and
exploiting strategic gaps and vulnerabilities in those
countries.]{.underline}

**[First]{.underline}**, [Russia]{.underline} **[does not]{.underline}**
[hesitate]{.underline} [to intervene militarily and support a
pro-Russian regime]{.underline} through political and military means,
such as the case of Syria.

Second, [Russian private military companies such as the]{.underline}
**[Wagner Group]{.underline}** [are sent to war zones to support
pro-Russian figures such as Khalifa Haftar of Libya and attempt to
encircle NATO for strategic leverage such as the Russian military
presence in Africa.]{.underline}

**[Third]{.underline}**, [mediation has become a primary effort to
obtain political and military initiative, as was the case in the
Karabakh war and Syria.]{.underline}

**[Fourth]{.underline}**, [the Collective Security Treaty Organization
has become the platform to inject Russian interests and military
presence.]{.underline}

[Last]{.underline}, [Russia]{.underline} [has kept]{.underline} **[third
parties silent]{.underline}** [through]{.underline} **[defense
sales]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[military
cooperation]{.underline}** [such as the cases of China, India, and
Egypt.]{.underline}

These cases show that [Putin]{.underline} [successfully
employs]{.underline} **[political]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[military]{.underline}** [means by well-planned
strategies]{.underline}, [the ultimate goal being]{.underline} the
survival of Russia through nationalism and
**[expansionism]{.underline}** [over the Slavic states, and building a
sphere of influence in its near abroad.]{.underline}

Russian Strategy in Ukraine

The Russian political goals in Ukraine are threefold. These are the
fundamental tenets of the Russian quest for domination: (1)
**[Repell]{.underline}**ing **[the West]{.underline}**, unified under
the NATO umbrella, from Russia's "borders"; (2) Making **[the Russian
identity dominant over Slavic nations]{.underline}**, **[setting Ukraine
as a lesson for the rest;]{.underline}** (3) **[Show the "able" Russia
to the former members of the Soviet Union.]{.underline}**

[Russia]{.underline} **[needs]{.underline}** a [success story to achieve
its goals and, as a result, Russia's possible failure on the ground may
create undesirable consequences for the Russian identity, once Russians
realize their country's weakness.]{.underline}

This may cause both a disillusionment and a subsequent dissolution in
the pro-Russian regimes, including Putin's Russia. In this context and
at this point, Russia's coercive strategy over Ukraine and its current
war with Ukraine have turned to a matter of life and death.

[Russian]{.underline} **[Nuclear Threat]{.underline}**

Putin's order to activate the Strategic Nuclear Forces escalated the
military and political tension with the West. [Russia regularly updated
its nuclear doctrine after 1993 so as to be able to use nuclear weapons
if it was not the first to do so.]{.underline} In this sense, Russia
challenged the concepts of deterrence and mutually assured destruction
(MAD) for atomic warfare. The reason for such a preference would be the
following.

[Russia]{.underline} **[knows]{.underline}** [that its conventional
military inventory is aged and cannot win a a full-scale traditional war
despite its numeric superiority.]{.underline} Modern warfare, including
proxy, hybrid, and asymmetric, defy the Russian conventional
capabilities, **[but]{.underline}** the West, or [NATO]{.underline},
[may]{.underline} **[hesitate]{.underline}** [to respond to a nuclear
threat.]{.underline}

[Nuclear warfare includes tactical and operational assets other than
strategic assets. The slow pace of the Russian advance may need a
tactical nuclear attack to create a gap in the defense lines of the
weaker but stubborn Ukrainian forces. Urban warfare is costly for the
Russian conventional forces.]{.underline}

A tactical or operational nuclear attack may clear the cities and push
the Ukrainian leadership to accept Russian terms. [In short, Russian
aggression over Ukraine is related to its expansionism inspired by a
political logic based on **nationalist imperialism**]{.underline}. The
primary motivation is to revive Russia's modern imperialism across its
sphere of influence. However, despite Putin's imperial quest, Russia
lacks capacity to sustain a full-scale expansionism due to limited
economic diversity, ageing weaponry, and an inconsistent strategy-making
process.

[Russia's invasion]{.underline} of Ukraine has [led to]{.underline}
[widespread]{.underline} **[condemnation]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} an unparalleled [outpouring of]{.underline}
**[support]{.underline}** [for Ukraine]{.underline}. At the same time, a
motley crew, including some academics and former U.S. officials, has
essentially blamed the war on the West, and in particular NATO
enlargement. The [argument]{.underline} is basically [that Russia
would]{.underline} **[not]{.underline}** [have become]{.underline} so
[aggressive]{.underline} [if Western powers had been more
accommodating]{.underline}. This line of thinking, however,
[is]{.underline} simply **[incorrect]{.underline}**.

That's because [Russia]{.underline} [rediscovered]{.underline} its
[imperial vocation]{.underline} **[before]{.underline}** [NATO
enlargement]{.underline}, [and the war]{.underline} in Ukraine
**[is]{.underline}**, in fact, [about Putin's great power
ambitions.]{.underline}

[Russian leaders]{.underline} have **[emphatically]{.underline}**
[argued]{.underline} that [NATO countries]{.underline}, led by the
United States, [violated]{.underline} [assurances]{.underline} [made to
Moscow]{.underline} at the end of the Cold War [that the alliance would
not expand to the east]{.underline}. [This claim]{.underline}, however,
**[has been debunked]{.underline}** as a myth. Even the last Soviet
leader, Mikhail [Gorbachev]{.underline}, has **[denied]{.underline}**
that [the issue of NATO enlargement]{.underline} was even discussed at
the time. Russian President Vladimir [Putin]{.underline} himself **[did
not]{.underline}** [have much to say about NATO enlargement]{.underline}
[until]{.underline} his infamous speech at [the 2007 Munich]{.underline}
Security [Conference]{.underline}.

[NATO's enlargement]{.underline} [began]{.underline} [in
the]{.underline} mid-**[1990s]{.underline}**, [at a time when
the]{.underline} [alliance]{.underline} [was embarking on a]{.underline}
**[strategic]{.underline}** [shift]{.underline}, focusing on out-of-area
operations instead territorial defense. [NATO urged new]{.underline}
member [states to focus on]{.underline} **[specific]{.underline}**
cutting-edge [expertise]{.underline}, [and]{.underline}
[programs]{.underline} for partner countries like Georgia were mostly
about training for peacekeeping operations in places like Afghanistan.
NATO's shift is perhaps best illustrated by the fact that the alliance
lacked a workable plan to defend the Baltic states when Russia invaded
Georgia in 2008. It is really only after that war, and in particular
after Moscow's annexation of Crimea in 2014, that NATO returned to its
original focus on collective defense.

The **[real reason]{.underline}** [for]{.underline} the [deteriorating
security situation in Europe]{.underline} --- and most blatantly the
Russian invasion of Ukraine --- [can be found in changes that have taken
place]{.underline} **[within Russia itself]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline} most directly [the]{.underline} increasingly
**[imperialist]{.underline}** [worldview of the Russian
leadership.]{.underline}

This change began as early as 1994 and accelerated after Putin came to
power. The war in the Russian breakaway republic of
**[Chechnya]{.underline}** from 1994 to 1996 [was in many ways the
starting point]{.underline}. [Russia's]{.underline}
**[defeat]{.underline}** there [showed how far the country had
fallen]{.underline}, leading many former Soviet republics to part ways
with Russia. [Moscow responded by]{.underline} systematically
**[undermining]{.underline}** [neighboring states like]{.underline}
**[Moldova]{.underline}**, **[Georgia]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[Azerbaijan]{.underline}** [through the incitement of ethnic
conflicts]{.underline} on their territories --- a classic
divide-and-rule tactic.

It is largely forgotten today that [Putin]{.underline}
**[built]{.underline}** [his political career on regaining control of
Chechnya]{.underline}, something he did by starting a bloody war on the
basis of a lie. It is generally well established today that the
[explosions]{.underline} in apartment buildings [in Moscow]{.underline}
in the summer of 1999 that Putin blamed on Chechen rebels [were in fact
carried out by the]{.underline} **[Russian security
service]{.underline}** [under Putin's own leadership]{.underline} ---
the purpose being to create popular support for Putin's war, and by
extension his leadership.

Putin's view of the world, in turn, is closely linked to his own hold on
power --- and that explains Russia's increasingly aggressive actions.

The "**[color revolutions]{.underline}**" [in Georgia and
Ukraine]{.underline} in 2003-4 [had the potential to show that
democratic change could happen in former Soviet countries]{.underline},
[something that would undermine Putin's pursuit of authoritarian
rule]{.underline} (what he called a "vertical of power"). [Democratic
rule in neighboring countries **therefore had to fail.**]{.underline}

Ukraine, in particular, was central to Putin. If a kindred Slavic and
Orthodox country like Ukraine developed into a functioning democracy,
this could pull the rug out from under Putin's project. If Ukraine
showed that something better was possible, why should Russians be
content with living under an authoritarian and corrupt regime?

For a time, Moscow tried other tactics. Pro-Russian politician Viktor
[Yanukovych managed to]{.underline} get [elected]{.underline} as
president of Ukraine [in 2010,]{.underline} [but]{.underline} his
**[misrule]{.underline}** [led to the popular uprising of
2013]{.underline}. [That event, in turn, showed that the Ukrainian
people saw Europe]{.underline}, rather than Russia, [as their
future]{.underline}. [Putin]{.underline} [responded by **annexing
Crimea**]{.underline} and starting a war in eastern Ukraine. At home,
[Putin's rhetoric became increasingly nationalistic, and now focused on
concepts such as the "Russian world" in order to foment a divide between
Russia and an allegedly decadent West.]{.underline}

For this to succeed, however, [Putin needs to bring Belarus and Ukraine
into the "**Russian w**orld]{.underline}," by force if necessary. [This,
rather than NATO enlargement, is what the war in Ukraine is
about.]{.underline}
